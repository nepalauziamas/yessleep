&#x200B;

Once again I was floating weightlessly in the void, drifting like a feather through the silent blackness of oblivion, however, instead of falling downward for what seemed an eternity, now I was rising slowly upwards like a deep-sea diver ascending from the depths.

\*\*\*\*\*

The first sound I became aware of was a computerized *Beep...beep...beep* at a steady, regular pace.

The first physical sensation I became aware of was a throbbing pain in my head.

The first smell I became aware of was the sterile chemical smell of a hospital.

The first image I became aware of was a radiant bright whiteness that seemed to fill my vision like the light of Heaven. As my blurry vision gradually cleared it resolved into a fluorescent light fixture in the ceiling above me.

I looked groggily down the length of my body and saw I was lying in a hospital bed and wearing a hospital gown, my bottom half covered with a sheet, assorted wires attached to various parts of my body, an IV line taped to my inner arm.

I reached up and gingerly touched the top of my aching skull. My upper head was encased in thick bandages.

*Beep-beep-beep...*

I heard a familiar voice cry out in shock that quickly became frantic joy.

"He's awake! Oh, thank God, he's awake!"

It was my mother's anxious voice, nearly shouting in mingled relief and excitement.

I glanced over and saw my parents sitting in chairs by my bed, both of them pale and worn-looking from exhaustion and worry.

In a flash my parents were up and by my side, my mother seizing my arm in a fierce grip, weeping hysterically and saying my name over and over.

I looked at them warily, my guard up, not quite ready to allow myself to believe that I was really awake and back in the land of the living. I distinctly remembered that nightmare I had experienced on the other side, when I had seemed to wake up safely back in my room and my mother had entered to check on me.

I watched my parents' faces cautiously, expecting them to, at any second, begin shriveling up and drawing tight to their skulls, their lips peeling back from bare teeth, their eyes sinking into their skulls...

But it never happened.

I was truly awake and back home this time. And when the realization hit, I began weeping with relief myself and embraced my parents as I hadn't since I had been a small child.

\*\*\*\*\*

My parents summoned a nurse who then paged a doctor to come see me. He inspected me, shining a light in my eyes and asking me some questions: my full name, my parents' names, my address, my date of birth, etc. The final thing he asked me was what was the last thing I remembered before waking up in the hospital.

I opened my mouth. I almost told him the truth -*- Aaron looking at me, smiling, happy for me but also sad, the pistol raised to his temple* \-- but then bit down hard on the words. There was no point in getting into any of what I had experienced on the other side, in that hellish netherworld the denizens referred to as Dead Land. They wouldn't understand, wouldn't believe me, would tell me it had just been a bad dream...and for all I knew, perhaps that's all it had been.

I told the doctor the last thing I remembered was the man with the bald, tattooed head and leather vest aiming his gun at me in the convenience store and pulling the trigger.

I asked the doctor how long I had been unconscious and was floored by his response: almost three weeks.

For three weeks I had hovered in a limbo between life and death, even though my entire ordeal in Dead Land had seemed to only last about a day and a half. The others had been right; time did pass strangely over there.

The doctor explained to me that the bullet the gunman had fired had hit me in the upper forehead, about an inch above my left eye, but miraculously only fractured my skull without penetrating it or my brain before being deflected off my skull plate. But still, my injury had been very serious. The impact had caused a severe concussion and brain swelling the doctors had had to alleviate by performing surgery, opening my skull to remove the pressure from my brain.

I asked the doctor just how close I had come to death. He was reluctant to answer at first, but after I insisted he relented and told me: "Very close. We weren't sure if we were going to bring you back."

They hadn't been sure I would ever awaken from my coma, or if I would have brain damage when and if I did.

The police came by a few hours after I woke from my coma to ask me some questions about what happened in the convenience store. I learned that after shooting me, the man with the gun had also turned his pistol on the clerk, who hadn't been so lucky and had died on the spot. The robber had gotten away before the police and paramedics arrived, but he was caught a couple months later holding up another convenience store in a different county. The guy, a meth-head biker with a criminal record as long as a broom handle, was sentenced to twenty-five years for the murder of the convenience store clerk and the attempted murder of me...however, with good behavior, he could be up for parole in only half that amount of time.

I never told anyone what happened to me during those three weeks I was in a coma. Not until now, anyway. I would love to tell you - and myself - none of it actually happened, that it was just some incredibly vivid, surreal nightmare I experienced following my surgery...but that would be a lie.

You see, around the same time I was waking up in the Intensive Care Unit, a different comatose patient in the same hospital, a twenty-eight-year-old man named Aaron Thomas, who had been on life support for almost two years following a suicide attempt, flat-lined and died.

Two days earlier, Nadine Stantz, a thirty-six-year-old prostitute and drug-addict, who had been clinically braindead and in a vegetative state for eight years following an overdose, passed away.

(I guess that when you enter Dead Land, you retain the age you were when you arrived, even as your physical body continues to age.)

The same day Nadine died, Clark Stevenson, a thirty-seven-year-old auto mechanic and father of four, died peacefully after lying in a coma for almost six months with a slow-growing but terminal brain tumor.

Three days before Clark, Dante Fergeson, a twenty-seven-year-old African American who had been in a coma since Halloween, 2010 after a car accident that also claimed the lives of three friends, died.

And a week before Dante died, nineteen-year-old Jeff Hewitt died after four months in a coma following an accident while swimming in a lake.

I know all this because I looked them up online, their news articles and obituaries, their pictures.

I looked up Aaron's ex-girlfriend, Anna Hastings, but couldn't bring myself to deliver his final message to her in person. She would have thought I was crazy or playing some cruel prank. Instead I mailed an anonymous letter to her house telling her what he said. It was the least I could have done for him.

It's been seven years and I'm twenty-two now and about to graduate college. I have a girlfriend I love, and hope one day to make her my wife and have kids. I try to live every day to the fullest, try to make the most of every precious moment of this life here on Earth.

Because I know what awaits us all after death.

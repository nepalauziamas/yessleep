It all began at the beginning of the summer. I had just graduated from school, and I was sitting in my room when I got the notification from my phone. Earlier that week, I had made a posting about looking for a roommate since I was going to move out when I graduated. When I got the notification, it was from someone who answered my post, saying that they were also looking for a roommate. I looked at their profile, and it seemed normal, so I answered back.

A week later, I had moved into the apartment which was near a campus, although I wasn't planning on going to college since I had already had a part-time job building custom PCs for people in the local area. Anyway, the guy's name was King, yeah, that's his name. He was going to college to learn more about acting, in hopes of becoming an actor someday.

This guy was pretty normal from what I could tell, although his skin was noticeably pale, but where we live, people don't go outside a lot because of the weather, so I thought nothing of it.

Things were fine from what I heard for a few days, but that was until one night. It was midnight, and I was ordering a part for a custom PC I was making for someone when I looked out and saw...someone standing there...looking at my window.

Now keep in mind, the apartment is on the second floor, and it was a corner apartment. That meant that the only rooms which had windows were the bedrooms, with mind facing the street. This was on the other side of the road, and under a streetlamp.

He was wearing black sweatpants and a grey hoodie, with the hood pulled over his head. I couldn't see his face due to the shadow caused by the light, but I knew that he was looking up because his head was looking my way. He had his hands in his front pocket on his hoodie, and he was swaying back and forth a little.

I didn't know what to do so I just pulled my blinds down and continued to work that night. The next morning, I walked out of my room and said good morning to King, who was sitting down on the couch. I did noticed the dark spots on his eyes, indicating that he was tired, so I commented on it. He was slightly confused at first, but realized what I was talking about, so he explained that he couldn't sleep last night. I accepted that explanation, so I walked out of the apartment.

When into my car, I saw a note posted onto my car. I got out, took the note, and got back into the car to open it. When I looked at it, I saw red bulky writing that said, "I'm more than what I seem."

I crumpled up the paper and went about my day. That night though, I was asleep when I heard a car horn going off. After rubbing my eyes, I looked outside and was shocked to see my back car window broken and an axe in my tire.

I called the police and when they came, they took notes, photos and evidence, such as the axe, and the note from this morning. I also told them about the guy from last night, as I was sure that he had something to do with it.

Nothing else happened for two weeks, until one night, when I awoke to get some water. I didn't know what time it was, but it was still night, so I made my way towards the kitchen quietly.

As I drank my water, I saw one of the most horrifying things ever in my life...the front door wide open. I put the glass down as I slowly backed towards my room, but someone grabbed me from behind. They put their hand over my mouth and their other hand grabbed one of my arms. Luckily I was able to use my other hand to grab the glass and smash it into the guys face. He let go of me in pain, and I turned around saw the same guy who had the hoodie on. He had a ski mask on, but I saw that he was white, noticeably pale around the eyes.

I ran into my room, locked the door and called the police. They came and took my statement, and left.

Ever since then, King, who must've been scared, as rarely come out of his room. Nothing has happened, and I do sometimes here strange noises from his room, but I don't think it's anything. However, I don't know where the mystery creep went.

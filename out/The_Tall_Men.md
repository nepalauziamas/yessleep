Okay so this happened to me a couple years back. As a child I never was very brave and didn’t sleep by myself till I was 7. I’m not a very good story teller, but I would like to share this as to get it out finally and to see if anyone else has gone through this. This was during the middle of 2017. I was 9 years old. It was just another boring school night as I mindlessly scrolled through our limited tv channels. At the time you could say we were lower class to be generous. I clicked on one of my favorite shows at the time. Wipeout. I was trying to ease the mood, as my parents were out on a date and my 9 year old self was not fond of being home alone at night. I lived in a very rural area so you can understand my fear. So I thought watching people getting bounced around would lighten my disastrous mood. Sort of of topic but I’m trying to give as much detail as I can. 

And then it happened.

It was only for a brief moment. But that moment would go on to live in my head forever. My living room windows didn’t have blinds but I couldn’t really see outside due to how dark it was. But I saw a black hand press on the window. I froze. I couldn’t move. As I sat on the couch in fear I tried to reason. But the evidence was already left behind. A handprint that was most definitely a humans. But it hand much more slender fingers to be anything human. I sat on that couch and hid under a blanket. I sat there for atleast half an hour until my heart sank. I heard a very faint but obvious “tap, tap, tap” on glass. I don’t have any memory after this event and I’ve concluded that I fainted. I lied there unconscious until my parents found me asleep on the couch. I cried my eyes out and wrapped inside my mothers arm explaining the situation. She told me with a very obviously concerned look that I must have been tired and paranoid which is a recipe for disaster. I can’t shake the feeling it follows me to this day in another town. I know that I was young and it easily could have been my imagination. But every time I let myself finally forget I remember the dread I felt after the incident. I tend to see that hand in dreams. It’s oddly enchanting at times. Enchanting in the way that all I can help myself do is watch in udder terror as the print mark gets left on the window. Anyone else had this type of experience? I live in Arkansas in a very rural area and locals tend to talk about “the tall men” mostly farmers getting a scare out of their kids and for a reason for them to not stay out late. A part of me believes that “thing” was a tall man.

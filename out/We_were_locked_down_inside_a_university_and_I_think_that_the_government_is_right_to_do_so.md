I was one of the survivors of the Legazpi city incident

I'm not gonna waste any time telling my backstory.
I am a 23-year-old male from the Philippines and I once lived in a now abandoned city located behind the mountains of Catbalogan Samar which is a city that's just beside mine, I was an altar server for the Saint Benedict Parish inside Saint Benedict's University in Legazpi city.

The reason why it got abandoned is because of the incident that happened in 2020 the government covered it up and deleted all records of the city existing because the reason why Legazpi city was abandoned is that what is there and what attacked it is not a disease or a rebel army but something that is far worse.

I am one of the survivors of Legazpi city and I am here to tell you what happened in Legazpi city.

It was a normal afternoon and I was in the church serving as an altar server inside the Church at Saint Benedict's University, the entire week was a scary one for the locals as there have been numerous cases of missing persons and murders around the city and I was told to watch out by my parents because the streets are now dangerous, especially at night, I listened and kept my guard while I was outside but now I feel safe inside the Church and the mass is coming to an end when a group of soldiers armed in full gear entered the church and genuflected while facing the altar and told everyone to calm down, we were shocked along with Father Jose who was presiding the mass.

The soldiers approached Father Jose and what their leader said sent chills down my spine.

"Father, we need your cooperation, and since you and the other priests manage this University we would like to use this University as a base of operations and an evacuation center for civilians living near this area, we want you to cooperate and help us in leading them throughout this ordeal, our city mayor has declared a city-wide quarantine and many left the city yesterday because of the situation that we are in right now"  

"Why? What happened and why is there a city-wide quarantine?" Father Jose asked 

"The murders and missing victims were finally solved but what the police found instead are dead bodies and evidence that a cult was operating in the area where the police found the victims, the police then encounter countless creatures beyond our understanding, and after some casualties, the police pulled back and asked for backup, we were sent to contain the threat until morning but it seemed that they are not containable in that area and the only thing that made them retreat to their lair is the firepower and the arrival of the morning," the Captain said

Father Jose nodded in agreement and went for the microphone and announced that there is something terrible outside and told the parishioners to not get out of the church or the campus ground, this added more to the confusion of the crowd but the presence of the soldiers kept them calm and composed, Father Jose then turned his attention back to the Captain and told him

"Get as many people inside this campus and I will tell the teachers and students to not get out of this campus" 

The captain nodded and said "You will be supplied by the government and we will garrison this university until further notice, good luck out there father, and keep your parishioners safe" 

Father Jose nodded in agreement and told every one of us to not leave and call our families to come into the church immediately, we did as he said and soon the entire campus was on lockdown, the school is full of confusion and questioning and then our families arrived in the campus escorted by more soldiers, it's a big university with a farm inside of it, everyone was confused as to how this place is in lockdown and that the government is ordering these measures to keep us but from what I heard earlier, I think this is much better than going outside where those creatures will crawl at night.

I met my family inside the campus and they asked me why, I told them the truth, and their faces are filled with disbelief and terror

"Is this true?!" My aunt asked and I was about to answer when her phone rang and it was her husband calling her, he said "hey....be careful and evacuate along with your family, we will be dealing with what's threatening this city and we don't know what they are yet but keep safe and follow the authorities" 

My aunt grabbed her 2-year-old daughter and carried the child in her arms, my family was convinced afterward and soon a ton of people escorted by soldiers arrived at the campus.

My grandfather asked, "what about our belongings?" 

I agree that we have to take our stuff here and I decided to join my grandfather to take our stuff from home but the soldiers stopped us and asked us where we are going, we told them that we were going out to take our stuff and the soldiers did not allow us to go, instead, the soldiers volunteered to do it for us and sent us to the evacuation center, I split off from my family at that moment and went on to help father Jose.

Everything was all set by the next hour and the night came, soon howls and barking from the dogs inside the campus are heard and inhuman screams from the distance were heard as well, there is something about those screams that scare me, it sends a message to everyone who heard it that those things are not to be joked with and the soldiers at that time are on guard and are ready to take on whatever threat comes, they barricaded the university gates and set up defenses around the gates.

I sit down on one of the benches in the church with the family dog thinking about what kind of stuff is happening when suddenly someone tapped my shoulder, it was Helena who was the female altar server and she sat beside me.

"What do you think about this?" She asked the fear clear in her voice

"What do you mean?" I asked back.

"I mean what do you think about this situation right now?" She replied.

"Well I don't know but it's best to listen to the authorities, for now, it's our best hope," I said

She looked at me and hold my hand and said 
"I am scared and I don't know what to do, I feel helpless" she started crying

"God is always here to help us, trust in Him and we are all here for each other" I responded 

"The soldiers-" she sobbed

"What did the soldiers do?" I asked

"T-the soldiers said they found my family but they're all torn to pieces" she let out a cry

I did my best to comfort her in this time of great sorrow when suddenly a sharp scream was heard and a couple of gunshots, I went out of the church to investigate and I saw one of the creatures being shot to death by the soldiers, it was an eight-legged monstrosity and long arms slender arms along with sharp talon-like claws, it faces is empty except for the abnormally large mouth it has on its head, Helena followed and she then dropped to the ground and cried

 I pulled her back inside the church and then I saw Father Jose rushing out with a Saint Benedict medal in his hand and a machete in the other, he charged out of the church and to the direction of where the monster is being shot at and along with the soldiers he joined the fight where the monster got a soldier on its hand while it seemingly tries to avoid Father Jose

 it was aggressive but it soon came down when the priest slashed it with a machete and then it was dead after a few shots in the head by the soldier's guns, they then dragged the creature down to the laboratory and everyone near the gate saw what happened, everyone panicked and the panic was stopped after a few gunshots to the air. This was just the beginning of my experiences and I'll tell more of it tomorrow

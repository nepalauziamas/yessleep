My name is Sean, and I will come out and say it – I am a sex worker.  Have been for over ten years.  My website lists myself as an “escort” but I am not ashamed of my job.  I love what I do.  To be fair, I am a very expensive companion.  If you don’t know how much I mean when I say ‘very expensive’ then you definitely can’t afford me.  Most of my career is spent in beautiful clothing acting as a partner to some rich man who doesn’t have time to date.  This means fancy hotels, amazing food, and an unlimited spending limit.  The actual sex part is very little of what I do.

Although, I won’t lie, my blow jobs are better than anything you’ve ever had.

Most of my clientele are regulars.  Some are married men who need a pretty companion for a night.  Some are businessmen who take me to fancy events and fly me around the world.  I get a few new clients each month who save up for a few hours of my time.  All in all they are totally harmless and deliciously obsessed with me.

You might have noticed that all of my clients are men.  This probably doesn’t surprise you.   But recently I got my first female client, and this is the one I need to write about.  

She said her name was Hope.  She contacted me on my website asking if we could speak over the phone about possibly setting up a date.  Before speaking to anyone I thoroughly vet them.  I ran her name through a variety of databases.  No crimes.  Definitely not a cop.  From the data I found she was a housewife in New Jersey.

I agreed to talk to her and called her from my burner phone.  She sounded nice.  Her voice wavered a little, which is understandable.  Most ordinary housewives probably don’t call professional escorts.  Our conversation was odd.  She kept asking me what I looked like, even though I knew she had seen my website (there were no shortage of photos on there).

“I’m 5’6”,” I explained to her.  “Slim waist and a killer ass.  I can have any color hair you’d prefer.”  I used my sexiest voice, “What are you into, baby?”

She laughed nervously.  “Oh, it’s not for me.  It’s for my son, Harold.”

I had some other escort friends who’ve done jobs like this.  An overly open-minded parent wants their kid’s first time to be with a professional.  

“Ok honey, no problem.  He has to be over 18 though.”

“Don’t worry about that.”  She cleared her throat.  “I noticed you didn’t list any pricing on your website, but money is not an issue for us.  We would like to fly you out as soon as possible.”

I checked my schedule.  It turned out my weekend was wide open.  We decided that I would fly in on a Saturday, stay the night, and then fly home Sunday evening.  My accommodations had to be first-class, obviously.  I would not sleep at their home.  I needed a five star hotel room as well as spending money.  This was all on top of my fee.

The flight was easy.  I love flying, especially since I get free drinks and first-class treatment.  I checked a few bags (full of costumes and toys).  I got to New Jersey, gathered my things, and went to go hail a cab.  But surprisingly there was a limo driver with my name.  This was going to be even more lavish than usual!  I graciously accepted the champagne the driver offered me.  I must have drank more than expected because I drifted to sleep.

I woke up in a luxurious room.  The bed spread out beneath me and my heart swelled with the thought of a perfect hotel room.  I sat up and quickly realized I was naked.  Obviously I was confused.  The last thing I remembered was drinking in the limo.  Cautiously I explored my surroundings.  The bed was huge.  Heavy purple curtains covered the walls.  Hanging from the ceiling was an ornate chandelier.  There were no desks or dressers.  The only other thing in the room was a velvet loveseat.  Draped across it was a cheap French maid outfit.  

I wrapped a blanket around my waist and opened the only door.  It was empty.  “Housekeeping?” I called down the hall.  No answer.  I took a few steps outside.  Although the room looked like a fancy hotel, the outside looked disgusting.  The rugs were stained and covered in dust.  There were no other doors I could see.  “Hello?” I yelled again, feeling more desperate.

“Oh, you’re awake!”

I spun around.  A woman had been standing behind the door to the room.  She’d been watching me this whole time.  She was wearing a fur coat with a kitchen apron underneath.  Her wild black hair stuck out statically from her scalp.  She looked to be maybe Middle Eastern, although I couldn’t be sure.  Gaudy jewelry adorned her ears and neck.  When she spoke, it came out as an angry politeness.  

“Good morning.  I hope you slept well.”

I clutched the blanket.  “Where are my things?”

“Don’t worry, they are safe.  But for now please put on the costume.  We would like to get started.”

“So this isn’t a hotel?  Are you Hope?”

She stopped smiling.  “Yes.  My name is Hope.”

Growing annoyed, I said, “I specifically said I needed a hotel room and-”

“You need to stop talking.”  She stepped towards me.  “Put on the costume.”

“Listen lady, I don’t care how much you’re paying me, you have to-”

“Shut up!”  She slapped me across the face.  Her long acrylic nails stung against my skin.  She opened her coat to reveal a large shotgun tucked into a pocket of the apron.  “If you don’t do as I say, I will open a pit in your forehead and then let my son fuck the bloody hole.”

The silence that followed was interrupted by my heavy breathing.  My mind raced.  My sister Jesse was my safe person, who knew the address and times where I was meeting my clients.  Every 12 hours (10am and 10pm) I would text her to tell her I was okay.  But that didn’t help much now.  I had to bide time until she missed my text and would call the police.

I swallowed and put on my fake sexy voice.  “Okay sweetie, no problem.  Give me a few moments to get ready.”

She smiled again.  “Once you’re prepared, follow the hall down to the dining room.  Harold is eager to meet you.”

I rushed back into the room and closed the door.  My head was filled with all the horror stories you hear about sex workers.  I was not going to let myself become a statistic.  I tried to find a window but there were none.  Escape seemed impossible.  I tried to steady myself.  It was important to keep a cool head if I was going to survive this.  Whatever “this” was going to be.

Reluctantly I put on the French maid outfit.  It was too small.  I could barely get it around my shoulders.  The tiny lace undies dug into my pelvis.  I must have looked ridiculous.  But this wasn’t my biggest problem.  Despite my discomfort I had to remain alert.  If there was any chance to escape, I had to take it.  I might not get more than one.

I ventured back into the hallway.  I could hear whistling from far away.  It made me shiver.  I crept slowly down the hall, noticing the poor upkeep.  Cobwebs littered the ceiling.  It smelled like mold.  The stark difference between the rest of the house and the room I woke up in was more than a little disturbing.  

The hall was devoid of doors.  It was just a long box.  At the end was an open portal.  Christmas lights decorated the opening.  I wanted to keep my head up and walk in confidentially, but I ended up tip toeing in.  It was too horrifying.  I couldn’t pretend.  

The dining room was just as odd as I expected it to be.  First of it, it had no table in it.  What dining room has no table?  Instead there were just wooden chairs in a circle.  One of the chairs had a knife stuck in the seat.  Hope stood behind the chairs, stroking her gun sensually.  Her coat was gone and all that was left was her apron.  I realized then that she was naked beneath it.  

Next to her was not the person I expected.  It was an old man.  He must have been at least 80.  He sat in a wheelchair, his eyes closed and a line of drool making its way down his neck.  He was wearing typical clothing, just some pants and a polo shirt.  Out of everything I’d experienced so far he seemed the most normal.

Hope approached me.  “What a pretty little maid,” she taunted.  “I’ve got some windows I need washing.”

My lips felt dried and cracked.  “What is going on?” I asked her.

“Isn’t it obvious?”  She walked over to the old man and pet his temple.  The man did not open his eyes.  Hope cocked her head.  “I paid you to fuck my son.  That’s what you’re going to do.”

My teeth rattled.  “That’s your son?”

“Yes, faggot,” she screamed at me.  Realizing the word she used, she calmed herself.  “I’m so sorry, little maid.  I…I truly do not judge your lifestyle.  I did before, but after Harold came out to me I truly love and accept you.”  She kept petting the old man’s head, harder and harder.  “I bought you for him, just to show how much I support him.  He means so much to me.”  Now she was scratching at his skull feverishly.  He didn’t react.

I didn’t move.  There were no clocks in sight so I had no idea when Jesse would alert the police.  

Hope held her hand up above her head.  She stared into my eyes.  “You can start now.”

I gulped.  “Start what?”

She smiled.  “You know what.”  With that she moved to the corner of the room, slowly moving her hands up and down the gun barrel.  

Shaking, I walked over to the old man.  He looked like he was asleep.  I tried to talk with some authority but failed miserably.  “Hello?”

He didn’t move.

“Can you tell me what you’d like from me?”

Still no response.  I was at a loss of what to do.

Hope called to me, “Do your job!  Make my son happy!”

I cringed.  Biting back tears, I started grinding against the man.  For the first time in my career as an escort I felt disgusting.  The old man barely breathed.  I bent over him and kissed his lips.  I felt like throwing up.  The man didn’t react at all.  It was like kissing a dead fish.

“Harold, do you like this?”  My voice quivered.

For the first time I saw him move.  It was small, but his face seemed to shrink.  He was cringing at my words.  I moved closer and tried again.  “What’s wrong Harold?”  Again he cringed, his face crumpling into deep revolted folds.  My body was cold.  This time I was as close as I could be to his ear, and whispered, “Is your name Harold?”

The old man slowly shook his head.  A tear fell from his closed eye.

Hope stormed over to us.  “You are upsetting him!  What are you doing!?”

I spun to face her.  “I’m giving him a lap dance.  It usually helps to get men…uh, excited.”

She frowned.  “Just cut to the chase, maid.”  She pushed past me and descended upon the old man.  Greedily she undid his belt.  He made small pained noises but didn’t move.  Quickly she unzipped his fly and pulled his genitals out of his pants.  When she moved away I gasped at what I saw.

His penis was trapped in some metal device.  Blood caked the entire contraption.  His penis now looked more like ground beef.  The small bits of skin and viscera was pinned in a dick sized bear trap.  The metal thing was unlike anything I had seen before.  Penis torture was a pretty common fetish, but this was far worse.  His genitals had been destroyed.  I threw my arm over my mouth.  The old man, even with his eyes closed, looked horrified.

Hope grinned.  She swayed as though she was turned on by both of our reactions.  “Harold wants a blow job.  You said you were famous for it.”

“Please, don’t make me do this.”  I started to cry softly.

She kept smiling.  “Funny.  That’s exactly what Harold said.”  She took my shoulders in her arms and pushed me forward.  I fell onto the floor.  “Blow him.  Suck him off, whore.”

I was sobbing now.  My eyes begged Hope to let me go but she pointed the gun directly at me.  I crawled over to the old man.  His decimated genitals sat in front of me like a sickening bowl of meat.  I tried to tell myself it would be okay.  Just pretend you’re somewhere else.  Anywhere else.

All of a sudden a loud noise came from somewhere in the room.  It sounded like a computerized voice shouting “Surprise!”  Hope began to laugh.  I looked around, confused.  Hope walked to the back of the room and pulled down a purple curtain.  It revealed a door.  She turned the doorknob and swung it open.  The sun was out.  It was daytime.  Hope’s whole demeanor changed.  She was giggly, almost childlike.  “Get away from there,” she said happily.  

“What the hell…” I stood up, completely confused.

“I hope you learned your lesson.”  She then bent the gun in half.  I realized that it was a rubber gun.  I had never been in any danger.  She was full belly laughing by now.  “Your family hired us to give you a little scare.  Maybe now you’ll pick a real job.”

My body shook.  “So…this isn’t real?”

She snuck closer to me.  “It’s as real as you want it to be.”  She reached a finger out and stroked my cheek.  Sweat poured down my skin.  “Now get the fuck out of our house.”

That’s all I needed.  I sprinted past her and out the open door.  I had no idea where I was, but I just kept running.  I must have looked ridiculous – a grown man crying and running in a French maid costume.  I didn’t care.  I just knew I had to get the hell away from there.    

I think a police car pulled over and tried to get me to stop running, but I was too panicked.  Eventually a cop stopped me and I babbled my story.  They thought I was on drugs and took me to the station.  I somehow told them my sister’s number.  I got on the phone with her and she was next to tears.

“Sean, I was so scared.  You haven’t answered your phone in days!”

Angrily, I replied, “Hope told me.  She told me everything.  You think it’s funny to put me through this shit?”

“Sean, listen to me-”

“No, you listen to me.  I was fine with my career until you guys set up this shit.  I thought I was going to die, Jesse!  This is sick.”

“Sean, stop.  What are you talking about?”

“I’m talking about you setting me up to scare me out of escorting!  Hope told me what you did.”

She screamed into the phone, “THERE IS NO ONE NAMED HOPE!”

I paused.  “Excuse me?”

Jesse was crying.  “After you didn’t answer your phone the first time I pulled up all the information you gave me on the job.  But there is no Hope.  I don’t know what you thought you found about her, but the address you gave me doesn’t exist.  The name you gave me leads to an 86 year old woman who is in a coma.  Your client doesn’t exist.”

My mouth was dry.  “But I saw her.”

“Whoever you saw was not Hope.  And you know I support your career choice.  Why the hell would I scare you out of it?  All I ever do is protect you.”

Without saying goodbye I hung up.  I was empty.  I tried to describe the house to the cops but I only knew it from the inside and I had no idea where it was.  I described the woman and the old man, but it didn’t matter.  I ended up just paying for my plane ticket home, curling up in my bed, and sleeping for the next few days.  Jesse came over and held me.  We cried together.

I don’t have a good explanation for what happened.  I only know what I remember.  And I know I will never get the image of the old man’s slaughtered genitals out of my mind.

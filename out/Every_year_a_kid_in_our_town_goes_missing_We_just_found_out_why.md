For twenty years, a kid would go missing in our town each  summer. They'd vanish without a trace, and without evidence  of foul play, nor proof that anyone had actually died. No bodies were recovered during the investigations, nor was anyone  retrieved alive.  


By all means, they seemed to have disappeared into thin air.  


Naturally, such occurrences come along a multitude of  conspiracy theories; ranging from monsters, to kidnappers with supernatural powers.  


Most of us, however, blame the lake. It was a beautiful piece of water hidden in the idyllic woods of Eboracum. Despite  appearing perfectly still on the surface, there had always been a strong undercurrent around the center of the lake. It was  theorized that it was caused by an underground river, but thus  far, no one had been able to prove it.  


So, after multiple ignored warnings to stay away, the police  simply put up a barrier around the center; where the current felt the strongest.  



Me and my friends were some of the many people to go  swimming there despite the rumors. We absolutely loved the  lake, with its crystal clear waters and bizarre lack of animal  life. We'd spend many every summer there, never leaving until  our skins had turned crispy red, or by the tempting promise of  ice cream from our parents.  


We were young, and we felt invincible. 


Years passed, and the three of us were about to graduate high school. While we were naturally excited to move onto college and new adventures, we desperately needed one last hurrah to  say goodbye. So, in the summer of 2019, we decided to solve the mystery of the missing children.  


Thanks to our part-time jobs, we'd been able to save up a  decent amount of cash. We used some of it to purchase cheap  bird watching cameras. Our plan was to place them in the areas where the kids had last been seen. It just so happened that most of those areas were within Eboracum Woods, concentrated  around the lake.  


The whole area was weirdly shaped, which meant we'd have to  keep an eye on parts of the lake ourselves. The center in  particular, was hard to get a view of from shore.  


We thought ourselves so clever to have come up with such a  genius plan. Little did we know that the police had thought of  the exact same scheme, only without results.  


Nevertheless, we set out on our venture to save our town,  thinking nothing could stop us. By the time we'd placed our  cameras, no one had gone missing. We were hoping to catch  the moment as it happened, and swoop in to stop it. In  hindsight, it was a poorly thought out plan, but we were  teenagers, what else could one expect?  


We strategically put the cameras around the forest, and some  by the water. Each day, we'd collect the recordings to check the footage. In addition, we'd camp out around the lake and just  enjoy the weather.  


The summer went on with little incident until the first week of  August. Then, a kid by the name of Alex Florence had  inexplicably gone missing in the middle of the day. He'd last 
been seen throwing a ball around with his sister by the lake. He was only seven years old.  


The police did their usual search, checking street cameras, and  sending divers into the lake to search for drowned bodies. Still, nothing could be found.  


We went through the footage, but couldn't find anything. The  only part we hadn't yet investigated, was the center of the lake.  I had just spent some extra money on a waterproof camera, and figured we could at least find out where the current went. We  connected the camera to a flashlight, and tied it to a rope.  


We took a canoe, and paddled past the barriers, ready to finally  solve the mystery. Though we couldn't see the bottom of the  lake, we expected it to be around fifty feet deep.  


I tossed the camera into the warm waters, and measured the  depth using the rope. Before long, it had sunk out of sight. 


20 feet... 


30 feet...  


40 feet...  


50... 


It had reached the supposed bottom. Yet, it kept sinking...  deeper and deeper. Within a few minutes, it had reached a  hundred feet. I looked at my friends in disbelief, wondering if  it had been swept away. But, based on the direction of the rope, it was just going further down. 



Once our rope had reached the end of its length, we had no  choice but to pull it back up. Hopefully, the footage could  provide us with some answers. We eagerly returned home, and  uploaded the recordings to my computer.  


The quality of the video was only semi-decent. At first, it  showed the clear waters below, only lit up by the flashlight  attached to the camera. It sank straight to the bottom at fifty  feet, just as expected.  


Then, we saw something else. It was just a tiny hole that  opened and closed, pulsating like a mouth trying to chew on  something. It only opened for brief periods of time, which is  probably why it went unnoticed for so long. Nevertheless, it  produced a current that immediately sucked in our camera.  


It got pulled through a tiny tunnel, small enough for a child, but too narrow for an adult.  


The tunnel went on for another twenty feet or so, before  opening up into a giant, underwater cave. There, it kept sinking deeper, until something horrific finally came into view.  


It was Alex Florence, the missing kid. He'd been partially  digested by strange plants emerging from the cave wall. They  reached out like tendrils, looking for food. The boy was little  more than barren bones, only recognizable by the fragments of  his clothes still there.  


The camera sunk even deeper. At last, we could see the cave  floor. It was littered with hundreds, if not thousands of animal,  and human bones, left to be forgotten for all of eternity.  


That's when we pulled the camera back up. We'd reached our 
goal, but another kid had died... Next, we just handed the  footage over to the police, and that was it. This year,  when we visited our hometown for the holidays, the lake had  been completely blocked off.

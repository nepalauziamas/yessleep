I love my wife Jennifer with all my heart. We've been together since 2006, both of us in the 10th grade. Like anyone else that's been in a serious relationship we've had our ups and downs. Nothing has ever seriously threatened our relationship though, not until recently that is... Jen's been sleepwalking as of late. I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, hell a good amount of people sleep walks. When Jen sleepwalks though, it's downright creepy. It's almost as if she's possessed or something. I know it sounds like I'm being paranoid but please, hear me out.

&#x200B;

I don't know exactly what day it was that she started the sleep walking. It was definitely within this past week. The first night wasn't horrible, a little odd, but nothing too crazy. I woke up to the sound of cupboards opening and closing. Not like she got in, grabbed a cup and then closed it, but just repeatedly opening and closing them. It was like a child slamming the bedroom door while throwing a fit. I looked over at my wifes side of the bed and noticed it was empty. I sighed and got out of bed, wiping the sleep from my eyes.

&#x200B;

"Jen, what's going on?" I called out as I walked down the hallway.

&#x200B;

Once I entered the living room I was able to see the kitchen and that's when I had my first *What the fuck?* thought run through my head. She was standing stiff as a board, head staring straight down at the ground. Her right hand was reaching above her head with the cupboard handle gripped tightly, opening then closing the door over and over.

&#x200B;

"Jen what the fuck are you doing?" I was baffled, her sleep walking hadn't crossed my tired mind yet.

&#x200B;

She didn't stop. She stood in the exact same position, in the exact same rhythm slamming the door. After staring at her with wide eyes for a few seconds my brain finally woke up enough to realize she must've been sleep walking. I'll admit, my heart was racing pretty good. I mean come on, it's  in the middle of the night, a pitch black house other than the hall light behind me, and I walk out to my wife standing like a zombie repeatedly opening and closing a cupboard door. It's kind of a creepy sight to wake up out of a dead sleep to. 

&#x200B;

I shook my head and chuckled to myself a little. I walked over to Jen and placed my hand on her shoulder and gently guided her away from the kitchen. Thankfully she didn't resist or anything, she mumbled a couple of incoherent words and allowed me to walk her back to bed. We went back to sleep and that was that. For the first night anyway... Then next day I told Jen about her little sleep walking incident. Instead of laughing like I thought she would, her face tensed and she looked very uncomfortable. 

&#x200B;

"It's no big deal babe, at first it did scare the shit out of me though!" I laughed, trying to comfort her.

&#x200B;

She gave a small smile and nodded. I found it very odd that she seemed bothered by a small sleep walking incident but didn't press it any further. Maybe she had an embarrassing memory or something and as a result she was embarrassed to sleep walk? Either way, I figured if it happened again I just wouldn't tell her about it. I honesty didn't think it would happen the next night as well, she never sleep walked in the 14 years I've been with her. I figured the chances of it happening were pretty low.  So I went about my day not giving it another thought. Before I knew it, it was bedtime and Jen was fast asleep, I fell asleep soon after.

&#x200B;

Sometime in the middle of the night I was woke up again. This time it sounded like a door opening and closing. My heart raced yet again as I rolled over to find Jen's side of the bed vacant. I rolled back out of bed and prepared to gently walk her back to bed. This time I kind of knew what to expect so I wasn't quite as alarmed. As soon as I opened the bedroom door I saw Jen. This time however, she was standing in front of the bathroom door which is located just 5 feet from our bedroom right in the hall. Her head was craned at what looked like a very painful angle and she was staring directly at me. If you walk down the hall and make a right hand turn there is our bathroom. Her body was facing straight towards the bathroom and her head was turned my way, a direct 90 degree angle. Her chin was literally right on top of her right shoulder. Her eyes were open so wide it looked like she snorted a line of coke or something.

&#x200B;

"Jen?" I nervously  called out.

&#x200B;

As soon as I said her name she froze, mid door stroke an all. It was so quiet you could hear a pin drop. Then, her lips curled into the biggest, widest grin I have ever seen in my 30 years of life.  Goosebumps immediately covered my whole body as my heart slammed in my chest. This did not look like Jen, at all... We sat staring at each other with neither of us moving a muscle. I was too afraid to move, in fear she would come charging at me or something. Finally, after maybe a minute or so her smile slowly faded and she got back to opening and closing the door. I quietly stepped back into the bedroom and closed the door, making sure not to make a sound. I got back in bed but couldn't fall back asleep. I just layed down listening to her open and close that door all damn night. Sometime right before daylight I heard the door stop moving, followed by footsteps coming down the hall. My heart was beating a thousands beats a minute as she approached. I rolled over and pretended I was asleep. She opened the door and walked up to the bed, slowly climbing back in. I layed as still as possible so It seemed like I was asleep. After maybe 5 minutes I heard her begin to snore and that's when my heart finally slowed down to just about normal pace.

&#x200B;

The sound of our alarm clock blaring startled me as I must've dozed off for a short while. The nights events fresh in my mind as I groggily got out of bed and got ready for work.  Before I walked out the door Jen woke up and gave me a kiss goodbye. I acted as if nothing had happened, not knowing how to approach the subject. I figured I'd maybe talk to her when I got home or something, but for now I needed to just get out and be by myself to get my thoughts together. Work dragged ass  because I was dog ass tired. I was half way relieved, but half way nervous as the work day came to an end. I calmed down a little by telling myself that tonight would be different, tonight she wouldn't sleep walk and everything would be ok.

&#x200B;

As  I pulled in the driveway another wave of nervousness washed over me. 

&#x200B;

"This is your wife damn it, just talk to her..." I whispered myself a little pep talk.

&#x200B;

I forced myself out of my truck and  walked up the steps to my front door. I opened the door and was greeted by Jens horrible taste of hip hop music. All my worried washed away as I heard her singing loudly from the shower. I chuckled as I set my lunch pale down and walked in my room to sit down and relax. As I sat there I debated with myself if I should talk to Jen about her sleep walking or just let it go and hope tonight was different. After all, she didn't try to hurt me or anything, it just scared the living piss out of me. Eventually I decided against talking to her, telling myself if it happened again, or got worse I would then talk to her. Satisfied with my decision I closed my eyes and soon after fell asleep.

I woke up hours later, as it was dark outside. I jumped as a loud thump at my door startled me. I looked up and nearly shit my pants. Jen was standing with her back to me, stiff as ever, opening and closing our bedroom door. Once again my heart started racing wildly as I attempted to stay still as possible. Moving my head slowly I looked over at the clock. 6:23 p.m.  *Why the fuck is she doing this awake?* I thought to myself as the door slammed in the background. Right next to the clock was a piece of paper that caught my attention as it wasn't there before. I slowly reached over and grabbed the paper, noticing writing on it.

&#x200B;

**Babe, I'm talking a quick nap. Dinner is in the fridge. Wake me up when you wake up.**

**Love you!**

&#x200B;

*Fuck...* I thought to myself. I was to busy reading to notice how quiet the room had gotten. My heart started beating even faster as I slowly looked to where Jen was standing. I Froze as I saw her. She was turned around slightly, her neck doing most of the turning. She had those same wild eyes and giant grin that she had the night before.  We stared at each other again for what felt like an eternity before out of nowhere she turned and booked it down the hall. Her steps thundered through the house as she raced into what sounded like the kitchen. I heard a drawer slam open and silverware being tossed about. Instinctively I jumped out of bed and ran straight for the bathroom, shutting and locking the door behind me. As soon as I turned the lock I heard her footsteps booming back down the hallway to the bedroom. She stopped just a few feet away as she reached the entrance to our bedroom. I quietly climbed into the bathtub and closed the curtains behind me, afraid she would hear me. I almost jumped out of my skin the footsteps started thundering through the house again.

&#x200B;

She ran through the house like that for over an hour before her booming footsteps finally stopped. I climbed out of the bathtub and put my ear to the door and listened closely. I breathed a huge sigh of relief as I heard soft snoring coming from the living room. This was my chance... I opened the bathroom door as quietly as I could, tip toeing through the living room. I looked over at Jen sleeping on the couch. On the ground next to her was the biggest kitchen knife we owned. I walked to the door and put on my shoes, grabbing the car keys as well. I slipped out the door ran to my truck, starting it and peeling out as fast I could. I decided to check into a hotel for the night and try and think of what to do next.

&#x200B;

So here I am reddit, holding up in a cheap motel. Jen texted my like 10 times and called even more. I'm ignoring her attempts to reach me. I feel horrible... This is my wife, and I'm afraid to death of her. She keeps begging me through text to come home or at least to respond. I'm on here to see if anyone has ever experienced anything like this before, and if so, .did it stop? Please, any advise would be appreciated.... I'll be sure to update if I get a handle on this, or if it gets worse. If you don't hear from me, well then I guess it's safe to assume she killed me. Wish me luck everyone...

I’ll start with a little bit of background; I always run through the same park that’s right next to my house. The park has a lake in the middle of it and a trail that runs through the woods and around the lake. In total it is about four miles in total from my front door around the lake and back. On a good day it will take me about thirty minutes to finish my run. Slower days will take about 35 minutes. I have an apple watch that tracks all my health metrics even though it usually says the same thing every week. 

The trail through the park can be a little confusing as it winds and twists through the woods. Some sections are far enough back that you don’t have a clear view of the lake except for in the middle of winter. There are also trails that branch off the main trail. They usually lead to another neighborhood like mine, but a few go on for a while through the woods.  Despite all of this, I’m very familiar with this park since it is the only place I ever run. The park itself is not very big, but the northern end of the lake does butt up against a larger national forest.

I left for my run at about 8:30 this morning, a little later than I typically leave, but this wasn’t an extreme deviation from my normal routine. Once I made it to the lakeside loop, I took a left and began to run clockwise up the west side of the lake, like I always do. Looking back on it now, I didn’t see anyone else on the trail from my house to the lake. If this had been just another one of my runs, I don’t think I would have even noticed that. However, with things turning out the way they have, I’m reexamining everything that has happened to me today.

Almost immediately after I turned onto the trailside loop, I saw another man jogging down the trail towards me. Apparently, we were the only people out running this morning. I didn’t recognize him from the regular people I see on the trail, but I hardly know everyone who runs at this park. As we got closer, the man began to slow his pace until he was walking. His expression made it clear he was hoping to ask me something, so I also slowed down until we were right next to one another on opposite sides of the trail. He looked to be about forty and appeared to be in great shape. He had one of those goofy vests people wear to carry water with them and a runner’s hat pulled down over his eyes. He seemed like a guy who saw running as a lifestyle rather than just exercise. 

He explained to me that he was training for some ultra-marathon and had been running through the national forest to the north of my little park. He was supposed to meet a friend at the trailhead in my neighborhood and catch a ride back home. The only problem was that he hadn’t run on this trail before and was a little confused about which trail connected with my neighborhood. He had already done two laps of the lake before he ran into me, and he was thrilled to finally get some directions. I pointed him back the way I had come, gave him directions for the rest of the trail, and then we both parted ways. I think the entire conversation only lasted a minute. I didn’t really think about this interaction afterward. I’d never met an ultra-marathoner at my lake before, but it’s pretty common to have people ask for directions around the lake. 

I kept running up the west side of the lake with no problems. There was still no one else on the trail, but again I barely noticed this at the time. It was when I got to the northern most section of the lake that things started to feel off. This is the section that is the thickest part of the woods and the furthest away from the lake itself. At this time of year, the trees still completely obscure your view of the lake, but the path is wide and very well marked here. It’s a straight shot without any trails branching off to confuse you. I suppose there must be a trail that connects to the larger national forest since the man I talked to had run down to the lake from there, but it would have to be small and inconspicuous since I’ve never noticed it before.

I first noticed an incredibly subtle but very off-putting feeling at the base of my skull behind my ears. Sometimes when I’m outside in the winter I’ll feel something similar. It’s like a headache in the wrong part of your skull or what I imagine a brain freeze might feel like. I also noticed my vision seemed a little off. I was on a very straight, flat section when the trail ahead of me started to have a sort of depth distortion. The section of trail immediately in front of me didn’t change, nor did the furthest section I could see; but the woods between both points seemed to get compressed slightly. It made the furthest section feel ‘bigger’ somehow. It was almost like the three sections of trail were out of sync. Both sensations only lasted for a second, but it made me stop running and glance around. I felt a little sick and I thought about turning around and calling it quits for the day. At this point I was already halfway around the lake though, so it didn’t really make sense to turn back. I kept running across the north side hoping that feeling was just a once off and waiting for the man-made dam that marks the trail’s turn down the east side of the lake. 

All of this happened over an hour ago. As far as I can tell I’m still on the north side of the lake, but I still can’t see the lake from this far in the woods and I haven’t reached the dam at the far end of the lake. I stopped running about twenty minutes after the weird sensations I just described. By that point I should have reached the dam even at my slowest pace. I know that people say when you get lost the best thing to do is stay where you are but I’m honestly not even sure I’m lost. The trail here is super well marked and maintained, it’s a wide gravel trail. I’m heading in the right direction since the path only goes one way in a loop. There aren’t even any forks or branches I could have taken by accident. While I don’t have every detail of the trail loop memorized, everything here feels totally familiar. I just haven’t reached the dam yet.

I stopped for a minute to type this up, but I’ll keep jogging down the trail once it’s posted. It feels wrong to call 911 in this case since nothing is wrong with me physically and I’m still on the same trail I run every week. I even have cell reception still, even though most parts of the lake are pretty bad with all the tree cover. I tried calling my girlfriend before writing this, but it went straight to voicemail. I’m not sure what exactly I’m asking but this is a bizarre situation for me and I’m not sure what else I should do. If you have any ideas, I could use some creative thinking right now. I guess that’s all for now, I’ll keep checking this post and leave an update if anything changes.

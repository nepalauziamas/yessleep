Curiosity aside, I usually never pressed any further. *”Just a stupid dream.”*

It was my second year in, though, when something happened again. At the time, I’d been keeping semi-frequent contact with Stephanie over the phone, given that the university campus was at least three or four hours away from where she and her folks lived. I was on the phone with her and we’d been talking for hours when, suddenly, I started hearing interference on the other side.

Her words kept cutting in and out. “Hello, Steph, you there? You’re breaking up, I can’t—“ I was cut off when I heard a familiar sound — the sound of children crying. I heard it for about a second before the call ended.

*”What the hell?”*

I immediately tried calling her back, to no avail. Every time, it’d ring for about thirty seconds before going to voicemail. I tried texting her, asking if everything was alright and telling her to call me back. Hours passed, and she never replied to either.

Ironically, it was storming pretty hard that night. Naturally, I figured that might’ve been fucking with the reception. But even still, what was that noise on the other end?

*(Why was he unlucky?)*

I went to sleep that night with this in mind. Moreover, I was just hoping that everything was okay with Stephanie.

*(I still hadn’t prayed...)*

The next day after classes, I tried calling her again, getting no answer. I looked to see she still hadn’t answered or even seen my texts either. *”What the... why isn’t she answering?”*

*(I wasn’t counting my blessings anymore...)*

I took a deep breath. *”Calm down, she’s probably busy or something.”*

*(The beast comes for those that don’t pray!)*

*”She’ll call me back, just chill.”*

*(SHE’S NOT THE LUCKY ONE!)*

I pushed it out of my mind for the rest of the day. That night, while eating dinner, my phone started ringing off the hook. I almost jumped to look, seeing it was Stephanie’s number. I answered and almost immediately had a heart attack.

As soon as I put the phone to my ear, I heard Stephanie's mom in absolute hysterics. "Oh god, Penny," she cried, "It's Stephanie, she's... she's..."

*(She's not lucky...)*

"She's *dead!"*

In those five seconds, my heart went from damn near punching straight through my chest to stopping cold. *"Dead... Steph... no, no, no, no, no... No, this isn't happening."* She was inconsolable on the other end, howling and bawling with grief.

Her voice was then replaced with the deep voice of Steph's dad. "Hello, Penny, you still there?" he asked. For a moment, I just laid there, holding the phone to my ear, my mind gone completely from my body. Like last time, it felt unreal. It was like time had stopped, I was in limbo.

*"No, oh God, please no..."*

*(I wasn't counting my blessings anymore...)*

*"God, no, not Steph!"*

*(I didn't pray, now my blessings were being taken away...)*

*"Why?! God, Why Stephanie, WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE YOU?!"*

*(Because I was the lucky one...)*

"Hello?" My heart started speeding up again. "Penny? can you hear me?"

"Y-yeah... Yeah, I can hear you. Wh-What happened?"

*(Why was I the lucky one?)*

He sighed and I could hear his voice deepen. "I... I don't know. Donna and I have been on vacation. Steph stayed behind to watch the house. We just got home and found... this. When's the last time you spoke to her?"

My eyes went wide. My tongue felt dry. "Uh... Last night. There was a bad storm and the call dropped. I couldn't get her back on the phone."

"I see..." he replied, his voice noticeably starting to break. I could hear him shudder before adding, "Sweet Jesus, it's horrible, Penny. I... I... I don't even know how to describe it." He trailed off and I heard him shuddering again.

He didn't need to describe it. As soon as he went quiet, images from that day flooded my mind again for the first time in eighteen months. *"Oh God, Stephanie, no... not like that!"*

*(They're not lucky like me...)*

"I-I'm on my way." I barely choked out. Admittedly, part of me didn't know why I'd said that. I wanted to be there for her folks, obviously -- they were basically *MY* parents, too. But at the same time..

*(She wasn't lucky and I wasn't grateful...)*

At the same time, I was afraid. Afraid of seeing her the same way I saw them that day. Afraid because I didn't know what was going on, *WHY* it was going on. And most of all, I was afraid that it was somehow my fault.

Absently, almost mechanically, I hung up and went to my car. I didn't bother getting dressed. Everything felt just as surreal on the drive there as it did in the dorm. Like I said, it was at least a three hour drive from campus to Stephanie's house, but that night, going down the road, time seemed to both fly past while remaining perfectly still.

My mind was empty. A hollow shell. Numb. Blank.

It was almost two in the morning when I finally got back into town. When I got to the house, There were police cars surrounding it. A couple of the officers were talking outside. "What happened?" I asked one of them.

They looked skeptically at me for a moment. "Um, Penny. Penny Reid. I'm... I'm a friend of the family. They called me a few hours ago, saying something happened to their daughter, Stephanie." They exchanged a glance to each other before the older looking of the two of them looked back to me.

"You said you were close to them?" he asked in a grave tone of voice.

"Yeah. Me and Stephanie went through high school together." I felt a lump form and start to burn in my throat, "We were basically sisters." The officer nodded, a grim expression still chiseled on his face. "They took me in and let me live with them last year after what happened to my parents."

"I remember that." the other officer piped up. "I was there. It was the exact same thing that happened here."

I broke into a full-on meltdown hearing that. The older one put his arm around me, "I'm so sorry, ma'am."

*"I'm so sorry Stephanie!"*

It was about twenty minutes later before I could pull myself together again. I walked back to my car and called her dad. I told them I was in town and asked where they were. He told me they were at the hotel just a couple miles down the road. I told them I was coming over before hanging up. I took one last look at the house, remembering all the times me and Stephanie would spend doing makeup, making prank calls, and just hung out. I turned away and left when I saw two ambulance men bringing out the gurney. *"No... not Stephanie... not like that."*

*(Unlucky...)*

When I got to the hotel, her mother answered the door and immediately seized me, crumbling in my arms. “I’m so sorry”, I cried. She kept her face buried in my chest. I just held her, not knowing anything else to do.

“My sweet little girl...” I heard her murmur through her tears. “Oh God, why’d it have to be my sweet little girl?” Her husband came over and put his arm around her.

“The Lord needed her home, Donna.” He said in the most broken voice I’d ever heard from a man. “He needed her home.”

*(The Lord gives to those that pray, and from those that don’t, he takes away)*

“But like *that*?!” She cried. He didn’t answer. “Why’d she have to go like *that*?!”

*(Why weren’t THEY lucky?)*

He shook his head, his face perfectly showing that it was taking every fiber of his being to hold himself together.

*(Why did the beast have to go?)*

I held onto her a bit longer before he pulled her away back to the. I then stood there for a moment, frozen. *”The Lord needed her home.”*

Those words echoed in my head on a constant loop. *”The Lord needed her home.”*

*(I wasn’t praying anymore!)*

*”The Lord needed her home.”*

*(I wasn’t grateful!)*

*”The Lord needed her home.”*

*(He took them because I wasn’t grateful for being the lucky one!)*

*”The Lord needed her home.”*

*(“...Please, Father, keep the angered beast at bay; he who was unfortunate, and continue to bless us with the tidings of another day...”)*

*”The Lord needed her home.”*

*(WHY WAS I FORTUNATE?!)*

“Do you have a place for the night?” Stephanie’s dad asked, breaking my trance. I looked to him on the couch.

“Oh, uh...” I stuttered. With everything happening, I actually didn’t even think of getting a room or anything. I was about to tell him I’d find a room, when he, already seeing that answer coming, told me I was welcome to bunk with them.

“We could use the company.” He said gravely. He tried to offer a half-hearted smile, but it fell almost as soon as it came. I accepted; *”Not like I’ll be sleeping anyway...”*

I sat there on the couch, huddling Stephanie’s mother close to me. Her dad sat a couple cushions down. Both were asleep. She’d bawled herself to sleep against me while he just slowly drifted off.

I was awake. Exhausted, but wide awake. This made everything seem to slow down. The night dragged on.

*(It was late...)*

The room was silent. Dark, empty and quiet with a sort of suffocating tension hanging in the air. My mind was likewise blank. I wasn’t there; I was miles away, adrift in a blank, featureless whirlpool. *I was gone!*

*(It hasn’t gotten any later...)*

I just stared at the walls in the room. I fixated on them. Tall, white, with pink flowery designs that stretched all across the baseboards. I studied these, studied *them*.

*(One isn’t like the rest!)*

It’s weird, isn’t it, the ways our mind trains itself to disconnect from trauma like this? In that moment, those walls were the world. That was my reality; those four walls. They were

*(Different! Something’s different!)*

Bland, yet beautiful. Simple, yet they stood out to me more than anything else.

*(THE FLOWER TURNED BLACK!)*

The temperature of the room shifted. I felt both warm and cool at the same time, causing the air to feel heavier and heavier. *Almost as if hands were around my throat...*

Faintly, VERY faintly, I could hear it. It was soft, almost inaudible, like it was coming from far away, but I heard it; the crying of babies! Then I could hear them start inching closer and closer towards me, getting louder and clearer.

My heart quickened, but I didn’t move. I couldn’t move. I *wouldn’t* move. *I didn’t want to move.*

I don’t how to really explain it, other than to just say that I was tired. I was tired from being awake all night, LONG tired from being emotionally drained for over a year when my parents died, and now, from Stephanie’s death.

I was tired of feeling. I was tired of being afraid. I was tired of

*(Being the lucky one)*

Being afraid.

If the “angered beast” wanted me, there I was; a fuckin’ TV dinner. Shadows crept up and across the walls. The crying was now almost deafening. Out of the corner of my eyes, Stephanie’s folks were fast asleep. They were oblivious to what was happening.

Soon, the entire area of the room in front of the couch was gone, swallowed in darkness. From within, two small red, beady eyes cut through the darkness, glaring at me. For a second, I could feel something, a wave of heat, wash across the front of my body.

I took a deep breath and spoke. “Here I am.” The eyes stayed still, continuing to just glare at me. The pressure in and on my throat tightened again. *”Stay calm... just breathe.”* “What do you want?” The crying sounds softened.

***”Why was it me?”*** a voice from the darkness called out. It was small, pitiful, and possibly even frightened. It was the voice of a child, one who was lost, crying out for its mother.

“Why was *what* you? Who are you?” The eyes glowed and I felt another wave of heat blast across my face.

***”They gave me up. They didn’t want me.”***

“Who didn’t?” Amid the sounds of crying children slowly rose the sounds of a woman groaning in pain; pain of childbirth.

*”Push sweetheart, push!”* a man’s voice called out. The woman screamed louder. My eyes widened, recognizing the voice.

*“Dad?!”* The crying children returned, getting louder as the woman’s screams of labor intensified. “What’s happening here? What’re you trying to tell me?”

***”You don’t know who I am, do you?”*** It asked, it’s voice once more muffling the chaos from within. I swallowed hard.

*(The beast wasn’t fortunate)*

“I... I...” I stammered. I wasn’t sure how to answer.

*(I was lucky. Why?)*

***”Mommy and Daddy never told you about me? About their deal?”*** I had no answer to this. I didn’t know. ***”Do you know who I am, ‘Lucky Penny’?”***

My breathing sped up. How did it know me? What did it know about mom and dad that I didn’t? ***”Tell me; do you know who I am?”***

“I... I don’t.” I conceded. “I don’t know you, okay?! You were just something they used to scare me at night with. I didn’t think you were even *real*!”

The room fell silent again. The sounds of crying and suffering ceased, dying abruptly. The shadow just loomed in front of me, Its eyes boring through mine.

***”Not real?”*** Its voice sounded a perfect mix of hurt and angry. My claim had offended it. ***”You kept me locked up for your entire life, you and your mom; kept me like THIS, and you thought I just wasn’t real?”***

“I’m sorry, okay?! I didn’t know. I just did it because mom said I had to!” My head started to spin. My heart was jackhammering against my rib cage.

***”Mom didn’t want you to know about me, about what she did to me.”***

“What do you mean? What did she do to you? Hell, how do you even KNOW her?! WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?!”

***”I’M YOUR BROTHER!”*** it roared. The room shook as his voice resonated. The echos caused my heart to stop abruptly. ***”I SHOULD’VE BEEN BORN, BUT THEY GAVE ME AWAY!”***

The room shook violently. It was the epicenter of a horrific earthquake. Frames and other things that hung on the wall were shaken loose. ***”WHY?! WHY DID THEY HATE ME?!”***

I could see cracks forming across the floor and up the walls the more violently the room shook. Chunks started falling from the ceiling. He was gonna bring the hotel down on top of us.

I sprang to my feet. “Alright enough!” From behind me, I heard Stephanie’s folks stir awake.

“Huh, Penny? What happened, what’s going o—“ I looked back to see her face turn pale. “Oh my God!” she screamed, “Penny, what’s going on, what is that?!”

I looked back to the shadow, my brother. The eyes moved to Stephanie’s mother, glowing bright red, enraged, again. “Don’t,” I demanded, moving my body in front of her. “Leave them out of this.”

The eyes dimmed again and the rumbling ceased. “I’m the one you want, right? I’m here, I’m not going anywhere, just let them go.” For a moment, everything was quiet. The eyes stole a glance to Stephanie’s father and back to me.

I turned to them and told them to go. Her mom looked at me, worried, wanting to object. “It’s alright, just go.” She stayed still for a moment before her husband took her by the hand and leading her out of the room.

I was now alone with it, the beast, my *brother*. I stared into his eyes, his blazing ruby eyes that burned through mine. I was paralyzed again, my breath shaking. "What happened?" I asked. It was the only thing I knew to say in that moment. "Why did you kill them?"

***"They killed me, first."*** his voice spat. ***"They got rid of me, and then, because they hated me so much, they kept me trapped here."***

"What do you mean, "killed you?" I began to hear the man and woman from my dream again, laughing before passionately moaning. 

***"They made me, but couldn't have me."*** The moans morphed into screams of labor, hearing the man's voice coaxing his wife to "keep pushing". This is joined by a rapid beeping sound that transforms into a flatlining ping. I heard the man start sobbing.

***"She was dying, and the doctors said there was little hope for survival. He was desperate, so when the man in the black suit offered to somehow make her all better, he accepted."*** 

"What was it, the offer?" I heard a deep, hoarse voice let out the most demented laugh I'd ever heard. 

**"One life for your wife, Mister Reid..."** The words echoed through me. 

*(Only one could be lucky...)*

**"I accept."**

***"He offered me to him. The man told him that she'd recover, that the operation would be a success..."***

"But what about you?" I finished, more as a statement instead of a question. I heard the children's crying return, softly rising.

***"They threw me away!"*** He cried. I heard the wailing of a small child, followed by the splashing of water. My heart fell from my chest when this was followed by the baby's wailing becoming distorted as I imagined it's screaming lungs filling with water. The demonic laugh from before joined in and soon engulfed the child's waning screams. ***"They threw here when I was born! It was dark, cold, and I was alone. It hurts all the time, here, Penny! I feel like someone's ripping me apart all the time. Do you know what that feels like?!"***

I was speechless.  I was shocked. I was heartbroken. *I was horrified!*

All this time, all trough my life, I was supposed to have a brother. Now, here I am, finding out my parents were *murderers!* Not only that, but that they'd condemned him to suffer even afterwards. ***"I tried to call out to them, begging them to save me. But then they got pregnant again, and this one had no problems."*** 

The eyes glowed, blasting me once again with a wave of intense heat. ***"They didn't need me anymore, because they had you. They had a beautiful baby girl who was healthy and didn't cost mom her life. I was left to stay here, hurting all the time."***

My throat felt heavy. My eyes burned, not from the heat of his rage, but from tears of heartbreak. "I...I-I'm sorry... I'm sorry." I heard crying from the darkness again, but this time, it wasn't a cacophony of many voices. It was just one, small, pathetic sobbing. 

***"They didn't even give me a name."*** I could feel the room start quaking again. ***"Why was it me?! Why did I have to be thrown away, huh?! Why did I have to be stuck here?! Why wouldn't they save me?!"***

The room rumbled violently. The eyes glowed brighter than ever and I saw the carpet flooring beneath me catch fire, spreading rapidly. ***"WHY DOSEN'T ANYBODY WANT ME?!"***

I was crouched on the couch, trying to keep away from the flames as best as possible. "Stop!" I shouted. "You're gonna kill everyone in the building!" 

***"Nobody cared, NOBODY EVER CARES! They only care about themselves. Even my own mom and dad killed me just to save themselves!"***

"I know, and I understand, just please--"

***"HOW?!"*** he bellowed, ***"How could YOU understand?! YOU got to be born! YOU got to live. They loved you. They didn't love me. And now, I'm stuck here."***

 The flames had all but engulfed the room now. Everywhere was an inferno. Smoke started pervading the room, causing me to gasp and wheeze. Still, I managed to call out to him. 

"Look, I get it. You're right. I *was* lucky. They always told me so, and told me to be grateful for it. But I wasn't. I didn't know what was given up for me. You have every right and more to be upset and you've already killed mom and dad. You want me, too, fine. Stick a fork in me, I'm done. Just please... let it be it with me, okay?!" 

The room slowly stopped quaking and I heard him sobbing again. The flames continued travelling across the floors and walls, travelling out into the hallway outside. The couch had begun to catch now as well. "Please, enough of this okay?"

***"I don't want to kill you."*** He softly whimpered. ***"I've never wanted to hurt you. I never wanted ANYBODY to get hurt. I just don't wanna be here anymore. I just want to have a life, to actually be someone, to have an IDENTITY, you know? I just want to exist."*** 

"Just calm down, let me help you."

***"How?"***

"You were never given a name, right? What if I could give you a name?" I thought for a moment before saying, "How about "Gift"? Gift Reid; My big brother, and the reason the reason I'm always lucky. The reason I can always be thankful." For a moment, nothing happened, save for the flames continuing to spread across the floor. The couch was now swallowed by them, too, only a small portion of the headrest left for me to perch on. A chunk of the ceiling overhead finally gave, crumbling down to the floor. *"The whole place is gonna come down!"*

Smoke had now filled my lungs completely as well. My chest felt tight from how hard I was coughing. Clouds now started obscuring my vision. I, for the first time in over a year, closed my eyes and prayed. *"Lord, anybody, if you can hear me, I beg you, please forgive me, and please, let my brother, my Gift, go."*

*(I was the lucky one)*

I blacked out after that. You can imagine my utter disbelief when I actually woke up, hours later. I was outside, being loaded into the back of an ambulance. Everything was still mostly blurry, but I could vaguely see Stephanie's parents' faces, calling out to me. I started coughing and gasping again, feeling fresh, clean air fill my lungs again. "She's waking up", one of them shouted. They then began giving me oxygen through a mask after loading me into the ambulance and driving off.

I was very groggy, but I stayed conscious the entire ride there. Arriving at the hospital, I was rushed to the ICU. It took several days, but I eventually started breathing properly again and my burns began scarring over. I was then moved to the infirmary. In all, I'd guess about two, to two and a half weeks passed in total before I was finally discharged from the hospital. 

About a month has passed now since that night. Every night since, before I turn in, I always turn off the lights and I say just a small prayer of thanks. Admittedly, like when I was a kid, I never knew if or who's listening. But, religion or no religion, I *do* know one thing, I am truly blessed.

Out there, so far that I can't reach him, He's out there. My brother, my angel, my blessing; Gift. I don't know how, but I know he was the one that kept me from perishing in the fire, as well as everyone else. I still think about him, and I hope that, one way or another, Gift found a way out and has found some sort of peace. 

Lastly, I wanna say this; despite the consequences for what they'd done, I am grateful to mom and dad. Had they not done what they did, I might never have been born. My brother's sacrifice is the single greatest thing that I have to be thankful for. He was my greatest gift, and it's because of that, and only that, that I'll always be truly lucky.

I wasn't sure if writing any of this down was going to do anything, more so for toehe than for me. I'm already too far gone, there's no saving me from whatever fate has in store. You all, however, are different, and I can only hope what you'll hear from me will serve as warning. 

Do not trust the woods, do not trust the water, and never, I repeat, never, give them any miniscule sign you've noticed their presence. Don't look them in the eye, don't flinch when they move or speak or even touch you, never speak to them. Unless you want to end up like me of course, stuck in a once wonderland now turned nightmare. 

I won't tell you all exactly where I live, since I know some of you dumbasses would still look for it despite my warnings. I grew up in a National Park, and as the title suggests, I am unable to leave. Not 'unable' in a, can't get in a car and drive off, kind of way but moreso, I am involved in something far greater than I am, type of deal. Things reside within the 6 million acre park, beings older than humanity itself, some of them not even from this plane of existence. 

For you all to fully understand the situation at hand here, or what I can speak of it, I'll have to go back to about 6 years ago. To the fateful day I fucked over my entire life without realizing it. Before I start there though, I need to describe the specific area I grew up in, and tell you all about some of the beings I saw before I made contact. How I went so long without doing anything before I'll never know, I like to think I had some god trying with all its might to spare me from this fate. 

The town I grew up in had a population of around 3000, no grocery store, and there wasn't a stoplight in sight for nearly 30min in any direction. It was quite literally bumfuck nowhere, a secluded area full of redneck hillbillies. The town was surrounded by massive mountain ranges on one side, and an incredibly large lake on the other. It was so big it would have been one of the Great Lakes if it had not been so far away. Winters were vicious, temperatures in the negatives even in the day, snowfall ending up nearly as tall as I am, and ice storms that left softwood trees destroyed. As a child it was like heaven, the snow in the winter, the temperate summers, all of the nature to immerse yourself in. Despite it all I’m thankful for growing up in nature, the times when I was innocent are the fondest memories to recall. 

I used to love to fish as a child; I couldn’t wait for those few months when the lake water was the perfect temperature to go out on a boat and spend all day on the dark water. It was out there, in the middle of the lake, when I remember seeing my first creature. At the time, I thought it was my imagination, that maybe I had seen our famous Loch Ness monster knock-off, Champ, in the water. Having now killed multiple of them I know they are far from fake, and not nearly as pretty as my childhood memory recalls. 

As I was saying, I was out in the middle of the lake fishing. The lake holds all types of fish, including some big ones such as Sturgeon and Northern Pike. It also has lamprey, which to most in the area is what they consider the most violent thing in the waters. I'm terrible at fishing, even worse as a child, so I wasn't pulling anything up. My bait was being taken time and time again to no avail, and my tiny patience as a kid was wearing thin. It has been nearly an hour and a half, the afternoon sun beating down my neck, so I decided to get in the water and try again in a little bit. Once my life vest was secured I was allowed freedom. 

The water was cold, as it always was, only going up to mid 60s in the summer, but it has felt great. I'd hated swimming with the bright orange life vest, but as a 7 year old I didn't have much choice. I had done a few laps around the boat, some awkward doggy paddle that made more noise than anything. I think it was the noise that drew the creature's attention. As I was swimming a little ways away, I couldn't have been more than 15 feet from the boat, I saw something underneath it. I had never seen a lamprey before, so I thought it was some kind of big fish. It was hard to make out between the glare off the water and the shadows of the boat. I couldn't go under with the vest on, so I was left with slowly moving through the water, heading towards where it was. 

When I was about 6 feet from the boat, near the ladder by the motor, I caught a better glimpse of it. Well, moreso it's eyes than anything, as its wriggling body seemed to melt into the shadows. Its eyes, the 4 of them it had, glowed under water, a bright green hue. It has no pupils, but I knew it's gaze was on me, watching my current movements. My curiosity was outweighed by some internal feeling in my gut and I faltered, floating idly in the water. I knew it knew I had seen it, even as a child I could understand that much. 

The 'standoff' had only lasted for nearly a minute before my mother's voice had reigned in my focus. "Get back up here if you're not going to swim anymore."

I couldn't disobey my mother, but that meant swimming directly towards where it sat near the ladder. My hesitation had been long enough for my mom to call my name in that tone, the one where you knew you were about to get in trouble, and I swam in. I had kept my eyes focused on the boat, ignoring what I thought was some strange mutant fish, and my heart picked up as I got to the ladder. It didn't touch me though, and I got back on the boat with no issues. I stared down at the water I had come from, waiting, but I didn't see any glimpse of it. 

The creature I saw that day I now call "Slimy water bastards", but their 'official' name is The Feasters. They look similar to lamprey, but are far more deadly. I've seen them range between 6-15 feet long, their black skin actually secreting some weird volatile slime that makes shadows darker, and does to your skin the same thing laundry detergent does. They have four eyes, two on top and two on the sides of their head, and I believe they use some type of thermal sight to be able to see in the complete darkness at the bottom of the lake. Their mouths are just a gaping hole that takes up 90% of their face, rows of spinning teeth and a barbed tongue that'll rip through your flesh and inject you with a nasty poison. Thankfully, they're very easy to kill, but what they lack in strength they make up for in numbers. You'll never find one alone, even if you only see one, they swim along in massive writhing masses, only sending out two to four for short periods to go check something out. Rather intelligent as well, the fuckers, and love to take small children and drunkards; easily manipulated people. When they get you, they leave nothing behind, their razor teeth tear into flesh easier than any knife. In mere seconds you'll be gone, nothing but a few blood drops in the water after the swarm you to feast; hence the name. 

You might be wondering how that wasn't the fateful day, since I had directly acknowledged its presence. It was because I hadn't seen enough, The Feasters are low level if you were to tier them. You either need to see a mid to high tier, or be vocal about the things you've seen, to get screwed over. I'll go into detail about the tier thing at a later time, I'll also try to explain the other reason as well but I admit I don't fully grasp how it works. All I really, 100% know, is that this forest is far older than any human creation or being inside of it, and the things that reside in this park have merely accepted humans living here. We're all ignorant sheep, unaware of the pack of wolves looming over us. 

I need to head out now, I have ground to cover and a creature to continue to track. I'll get into the actual start of this bullshit next time, so goodbye for now. 

Don't look at them, don't speak to them, don't trust them.

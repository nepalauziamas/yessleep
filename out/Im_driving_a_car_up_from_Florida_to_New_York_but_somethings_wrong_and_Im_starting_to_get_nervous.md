I'm writing this in a gas station in what I think, I *hope*, is Virginia. I'm not sure.

I was vacationing with some buddies down in Miami, and after the weekend, a friend offered me a grand to drive his minivan up to New York. I was a little behind on my rent, and the Miami weekend wasn't cheap either, so I shrugged and accepted. I cancelled my plane tickets, and Tuesday morning I headed out for what should have been an 18-hour trip.

Now, you don't really need a GPS for most of the way. For the most part, you just sit on the I-95 for something like 1000 miles and then, voila, you're in New York. But I always turn it on because it makes me feel better about the drive, makes me feel like I'm actually getting closer to my destination.

The ride for the most part went smoothly for the first ten hours or so. The first sign that something was off came around ten hours into the trip when my ETA went up by an hour. Fine. That happens all the time. Probably traffic on the turnpike, right? But it didn't give a reason. It just tossed another hour on my drive for apparently no reason at all. But, you know, Google Maps just does that sometimes. I switched to Waze, which gave a completely different ETA, and kept driving.

Soon the GPS popped another hour onto my ETA. I was getting pretty frustrated now, having driven down the I-95 for like ten hours and somehow my destination was getting farther away from me. As I pounded on the wheel in anger, I saw something interesting. A 1973 Dodge Dart Sport drove past me. It was in flawless, perfect working condition, as if it had rolled off an assembly line the previous day. The road was suddenly full of old cars. Not fancy cars, just old ones, in great condition. Minivans, sedans, muscle cars, stretching all the way back to the 50's. Just as suddenly, they drove past me, going much, much, higher than the limit, speeding off into the distance. I looked back down to my GPS to discover that despite the fact that I had had my foot down on the gas for the last thirty minutes, my destination had apparently become another hour away from me.

Swearing and mumbling to myself, I turned on the radio to hear about pleasant weather and smooth traffic. The internet also yielded no reasons why my trip was slowing down so much. Frustrated, I pushed my foot down, driving past harried families as I surpassed the speed limit.

When another hour was added to my drive, I began throwing a useless little tantrum, yelling and pounding on the steering wheel. Fuming, my voice shot, I pulled into a random rest area to calm down. All the old cars were gone and had been replaced by modern models. As I stretched my legs, I struck up a conversation with a random stranger. He was headed in the opposite direction as me, and was hoping he'd be there in ten hours or so. That's when I really started to sweat. I was sure that I drove at least fifteen hours with only the most minor stops. How could I be only ten hours away from Miami?

I stuck my destination in Maps again. My ETA had jumped up to twenty hours, which is what it had been when I left. I went back to my car and sat there in disbelief. I might have cried. I just wanted to get home! I turned on the radio and sped out of the rest stop, thinking of where I'd have to spend the night. A parade of old cars surrounded me again, as the radio blasted Hank Williams' *Lost Highway.* This time I matched their speed, breezing past the limit, halfway wishing that I would get pulled over so I could experience some kind of change.

With no such luck, the ETA finally started to go down again. Feeling encouraged, I refused to stop at night, driving through the dark, my brights on and my windows down to keep me awake. The next gas station I pulled into was empty of attendants, though there was a cold man there filling up his '98 Prius as his dull-eyed kids watched me from the back. He almost said something to me, but then shook his head and drove on.

I hit the road again, but my ETA refused to go down. My time to arrive stayed the same, hour after hour, no matter how long I pushed down on the pedal, no matter how many times I rerouted the GPS. Nobody answered my calls, or responded to my messages. Night turned into day and my ETA had gone down by fifteen minutes.

By this point in time, I felt like I had been driving for at least 30 hours, and I was getting drowsier and drowsier. As I sped down the highway, I felt myself floating above it. I rose higher, higher, higher, until I could see all of America, summed up in straight lines of white paint and headlights. For the first time, I truly appreciated how large America is. I saw beacons of light in Chicago, L.A., New York, connected by endless rows of headlight and taillights, mapping out the real America.

America is so, so, vast, and we tried to tame it with asphalt and concrete and white and yellow paint. But the real America is still out there, tied up in our highways. People like to say that the world has gotten smaller. But that's not true, not true at all. The old, larger world is still out there, and if you're not careful, it can swallow you whole.

I looked down at the old America and focused on the I-95, circling random positions until I found my own old busted-up minivan swerving up and down the road as I drifted off into unconsciousness. With great reluctance I drifted back down into the car and grabbed hold of the wheel. I didn't need to worry. I somehow doubt I could crash my car now. My GPS informed me that I was 93 hours from my destination, and I reached out and shut it off.

The 1973 Dodge Dart Sport from earlier came up on the road and I drove up alongside it. A young couple, looking haggard and drawn, stared back at me with eyes that were far older than they had any right to be. We nodded at each other and as they sped off, I pulled over and entered an empty gas station, the same one I'm sitting in right now as I write this. I looked at the tank and was unsurprised to see it had barely lost a gallon since the last time I filled it up, hours and hours ago. There was nobody around, so I sat down and wrote this out. When I'm done, it's time to hit the road again. I've got to get where I'm going eventually.

So if you're out there on the I-95, and you see a blue Honda Odyssey, wave to me. We're all out here on the lost highway, trying to escape the other America. I'm driving as fast as I can, hoping to reach my destination someday, looking at my GPS as it repeats my own little prayer:

...rerouting...

...rerouting...

...rerouting...

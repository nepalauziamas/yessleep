My heart stopped. My mouth hung open. I wanted to scream, but for whatever reason, I couldn't! *"Oh Jesus, he's right here! Right beside me! Where did he come from?!"*

*(He appeared from thin air...)*

*"What happened to Officer Vega, what did he do to him? What's he gonna do to me?!"*

He stared straight ahead, almost hypnotized to the road as it stretched on. I darted my eyes over to the passenger door. It was unlocked. Slowly, just ever so slightly, I moved my hand to grab the handle. *"I have to jump, it's my only way--"*

"Don't do it." His voice was still as mellow and smooth as before. I looked back to him. His focus was still deadlocked on the road. "I have to get away, and you'll want to come with me."

"Wh-What?" I asked, still shaking. He didn't reply. We kept racing down the highway at a horrifying speed. I looked again at the door handle before grabbing it and throwing the door open, ready to hurl myself out. Before I could, however, I was grabbed by the back of my shirt and jerked back into the car. This caused the back of my head to smack against the doorframe, knocking me dizzy.

He shut the door again before returning his gaze to the road. My vision had exploded into a mess of cloud and fuzz. My head throbbed and I could feel the beginning of a horrible migraine. I heard the door locks click. He'd locked me in, I couldn't try escaping again. *I was trapped.*

*(He's trying to get away...)*

"Please," he said calmly, "Don't panic. I won't hurt you." I barely registered his words. Everything was still fuzzy, both visually and auditorily. "I never hurt anyone."

"Y-You're h-him." I groaned, aching. "You're--You're him; the 'Fallen Angel'." His eyes were still focused ahead. "What do you want with me?"

*(He was running from something)*

He was silent for another moment before replying, "I don't want anything from you. I want to help you."

“What?”

“You won’t understand, but I’m here to help you.”

“What are you talking about? How are you “helping me”; and where are you taking me?”

*(He’s trying to get away from something...)*

“You don’t see them yet, but they see you. They’ve always seen you. They see everyone. They see the others and take them.”

I was floored. “What? Who? What the fuck are you going on about?!”

*(The eyes...)*

“Please calm down. Just keep looking forward and soon, you’ll begin to see them, too.”

“SEE WHAT?!” I exclaimed.

*(No one can see them, but they see us...)*

“Them.” He said, pointing all around. “They see us. They control us, and they take anyone who has the ability to see them. To see the truth.”

*(He’s afraid of them; he can see them...)*

“What do you mean? Who are *“they?“*

“They’re not a “Who”, they’re everything and nothing. They are power, and they crave control. They watch us and force us to live by their will, and we can’t know because we can’t see.”

*(The road kept going...)*

I was lost. Hilariously lost. None of what I heard made any sort of connection to me. It didn’t sound at all logical. It sounded like something a wing-nut, tinfoil hat wearing crackpot would say.

*(How long did the road last?)*

Who was “watching us?” Was he talking about the government or something? Was that who he “had to get away from”?

*(Quiet, empty, endless road...)*

*”Why couldn’t anyone see them?”*

*(Was it a real road? Where was anything or anybody else?)*

I looked forward. The road stretched on as we continued speeding along. “Just keep looking. You’ll see it; the truth.”

I did. At first, I was still confused, what was so important for me to apparently see?

*(The road hadn’t changed...)*

I then, however, noticed something about it. It was just a subtle thing at first, and I almost missed it. Then, however, I realized that we were passing the Publix again.

*(We never left...)*

*”What the... did we just drive in a circle?”*

*(The road doesn’t change, just the way we see it...)*

That wasn’t all, I could see everything that had been around it again as well; the same road signs, the other markets, even the *houses* that’d been in the area, everything. “You see it, now, don’t you?” He asked, his voice for the first time sounding actually worried, like he was afraid that I did. I began to wonder why.

Why, despite the fact that we should’ve been *miles away* by now, were we passing by the same places? Why was I locked in the car with this psycho, a known *serial killer*? More than this, though, why was *he* so afraid? *”How does he know any of this, and why does he want ME to know?”*

All of this had my head buzzing so badly that I almost didn’t see other changes to the environment outside. I first caught it out of the corner of my eye. I noticed that everything began to subtly change color, by which I mean that it began to *lose* color.

It was a progression, but I soon began to see the grass go from a bright, lush, healthy green, to a stark, albino white; devoid of any definition or health. The same became true for everything else. It was like someone was slowly trying to erase the world outside, leaving only the blank, featureless outlines of the things that’d been there.

By this point, I was beyond the ability or capacity to ask what the fuck was going on. I could only stare out front through the windshield, horrified. I did manage to choke *one* question out; “Wh-where am I?”

“This”, he said, his voice, while still smooth, noticeably becoming deeper, “Is the world, the *”real world”*, you might call it.”

“What?”

His voice got lower. Deeper. “Most won’t see the world like this. Only those of us who see the truth. Those that see *them.*”

“See *who?!*” I cried desperately. I began to feel something warm coming from his direction. It grew hotter and hotter, intensifying, until I looked over to him and, ironically, felt my blood chill. He was now *glowing!*

Around his body was a bright, golden aura that got glowed brighter and brighter. My eyes went wide seeing this, wider than they’d ever been. *”What the fuck?! What is this, how is he glowing?! Who... WHAT the fuck is he?!”*

*(An Angel, a guide, a holy light to an unknown path...)*

I didn’t voice any of this (and not even because I didn’t want to, but rather I just *couldn’t*). Even still, I must’ve still conveyed my feelings of utter shock, utter *terror*, at what I was seeing.

*(Seeing is believing, and knowledge is frightening...)*

“Don’t be afraid.” he said in a voice that now boomed so much that it shook throughout my body, echoing like the inside of a drum. “Your fear will draw them towards us.”

“What are you talking about, Goddamn it?!” I was at my wits end. No, I was *beyond* my wits end! I was so far past that, that if I *did* wake up from whatever little pipe dream this was, I’d have to be institutionalized on the spot! “Look, enough of this cryptic horseshit, either tell me what the hell’s going on, or let me out of here,  NOW!”

“Quiet!” He thundered. He now no longer looked the same. He no longer even looked like a person. Now, his body was just a golden, glowing outline of a man with long, thin wisps coiling from different areas of his form. This once again made me go speechless.

“Just relax, please. I know this is hard for you, that’s why I’ve brought you here. You’re afraid, I know, but I’m here to save you from that.”

“I... I don’t...”

“Just keep looking. See the truth.”

“What truth?”

“That the world you know was never real. That what you know is only what you’ve been allowed to see. This, child, is always what the world, the *real* world has been; their blank slate. Their sandbox. Their playground.”

“For the love of God, who are “they?” You keep mentioning these things, but who or what are they?! *Where* are they?! Why can’t I see them?!”

*(I couldn’t see them because I couldn’t see ghosts. I didn’t believe in ghosts...)*

“Oh no”, I heard him murmur, still in an impossibly deep, “angelic”, for lack of any better word, voice. “They’ve found us.”

Overhead, from the blank, featureless sky above, I watched as a large black crack split across like the splitting of ice. From this rift, a blinding light bled down as the sky split apart. My heart stopped dead in my chest when I watched a hoard of eyeballs that were clustered together to form one giant, writhing, disgusting, and just straight horrifying mass descend.

Each and every one of the thing’s thousands of irises were different colors, some of which were mixes of colors I didn’t even know were possible. Each pupil twitched in every direction simultaneously, apparently searching desperately for something.

*(Not something; someone...)*

I felt the car pick up speed. The mass of eyes began vibrating at a supersonic level, glowing intensely as it did so. “Wh-What is *THAT?!”*

“Them, the ones I’ve been telling you about. The ones that see everything in your world.”

“What does it want?”

“Control. They seek only control, over you and everything it created on this Earth.”

“What do you mean, “Everything *IT* created?”

“I told you before, your world is a sandbox. They, It, is the one that builds on it. And, believe me, they are *very* much a jealous people when it comes to power, to control. That’s why you and others can’t see them, but they always see you.”

I looked in front of me again to the thing. It was now vibrating somehow even more violently and starting to glow an aura of deep, burning crimson. It was angry.

“What is it doing?” I asked, petrified.

“It’s searching. It knows another of its toys is trying to be taken from it, so it’s trying to find us. When it does, it’ll unmake the both of us, wiping us out, just like they did with the others.”

“Others? What do you mean? Who?” To this, I heard him sigh. For the first time, he actually sounded mournful, sad even. Like he was regretting something, confessing some secret or deed he’d tried to keep hidden away; buried, deep down.

“I’m not a monster like you all think I am. I’ve seen what you call me, what you see me as. But I’m not a killer. I never hurt anyone. At least, not intentionally.”

I cocked my eyebrow, “What do you mean?”

He sighed again. “My eyes were opened to all of this, to the truth, a long time ago. Because of this, I wanted to spread the truth to others whose eyes *haven’t* been able to see. I wanted others to break free of them and their control, but every time I did, It always saw and always found them and took them, wiping them out.”

“You mean... the victims...”

“Weren’t mine.”

I was stunned again. I couldn’t think straight. With the world essentially ending right in front of me at the whim of *whatever* the hell this abomination was, and now the revelation that this guy, this psychotic freak, wasn’t a monster after all, I was almost completely at a loss for words. Finally, I found the will to voice one more question, the only one that mattered to me in that moment: “What are we gonna do? How do we stop it?”

“Like I said, your fear is attracting them. It’s what’s keeping your eyes closed. What’s keeping you under their influence, their control. You have to stop being afraid. Purge yourself of your fear.”

“H-how?” I asked, not at all understanding how that was even possible. How was I supposed to NOT be afraid? How, witnessing all of this; these things that were the kind of stuff people only saw either during their worst nightmares, or their worst drug trips, was I supposed to *STOP* being afraid? 

*(I've never opened my eyes before...)*

*"What if I can't get rid of it? would happen if it got me? Would I be wiped out, too, like the victims? What if it doesn't work?! HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO GET RID OF FEAR?!"* 

*(My eyes aren't open yet...)*

My spiraling train of thought came to a screeching halt when one of the terrifying entity's gleaming red tendrils shot through the windshield, seizing and tightening around the man's wrist. I could hear a sizzling noise, followed by the smell of sulfur and the man letting out a sharp cry of pain in a tone that didn't sound entirely human; at least not just one, almost like multiple people screaming at the same time from the same throat.

Instincts kicked in and I reached out to try and pull it off of him, only to immediately retract in pain before I could even touch it, feeling like my hands were on fire. The tendril coiled up across his arm, leading up and around his neck. It then began pulling him forward, trying to yank him through the windshield. His seatbelt was the only thing keeping him inside.

Eventually, I saw the straps being torn at the seams from pressure. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what I *could* do.

*(My eyes...)*

 "YOU HAVE TO LET GO!" he bellowed, groaning in pain. The belt straps were only barely holding together. The tendril was worming itself into his mouth and down his throat. I looked out again at the thing, the monster. It's pulsing eyeball mass glowed brighter and brighter. I could feel the heat, searing and unforgiving. I could feel anger from it; raw, unfiltered malice. I could feel its *hatred!*

Brighter and brighter, the gleaming tendril burned, scorching the man until he erupted into flames himself. In seconds, *less* than seconds, he was engulfed in a burning ball of crimson fire. I'll never forget how his screams sounded as he burned; like a thousand people were screaming at the same time as they were cooked alive. He strained to scream one last thing to me before he was gone, seared away; "LET IT ALL GO!"

I was alone now. I had no weapon, no power, and no idea what to do. The thing loomed over the car, setting its sights on me now. This was it. I was done for.

*(I have to open my eyes!)*

***"Ea adhuc tenetur..."*** I heard the thing bellow in a voice somehow even more impossibly deep than even the man was a minute ago. It was almost equivalent to the sounds of an earthquake rumbling. ***"*** ***Perfide abiit, sed adhuc timet. Adhuc tenetur."***

I closed my eyes, bracing for the end. 

*(My eyes!)*

**\*\*\***

I thought of home, my apartment. I thought of Paul, our date. I thought of the two of us together, at the theatres, watching the movie together; laughing, jumping at the thrilling scenes, cutting up.

*(OPEN MY EYES!)*

**\*\*\***

I thought of the times that I'd been scared in the past, like when I was a little girl and was caught in the deep end of a pool or lake. Every time my head would go under, I'd close my eyes, afraid of what I'd see if I opened them, Imagining some vicious beast, ready to tear me apart. *Or I'd see nothing at all, ever again...*

*(OPEN THEM!)*

 I remembered how when I did open them again, I'd always see the sunlight. I'd be okay. 

*(NOW! OPEN THEM NOW!)*

I had managed to struggle my way to the surface. I'd made it out, where I'd see my dad there, telling me that everything was okay. That he had me now, *That I was safe...*

*(OPEN MY FUCKING EYES!)*

**\*\*\***

I felt something inside me shifting. A sense of determination. A dormant instinct. *Defiance*.

I wanted to survive. I wanted to be free. To live. But more than this, I wanted to beat this fuckin' thing right here, right now!

I opened my eyes again. The entity still towered above the car; vibrating, glowing, pulsing. I felt my own body begin to feel warm. Quickly, I began to feel hotter and hotter. It wasn't painful, though. It was *invigorating!*

I was doing it. I was letting go. I wasn't afraid, of it or whatever it could do to me. 

The Entity's mass began frantically pulsing again, It's bright red aura returning with more vengeance than before. I knew it was getting desperate. *It knew!*

***"Vinculum rupit!"*** The thing roared. I could see it's eyes, each and every one of them. Now *It* was afraid! 

Staring dead at it, I felt triumph wash over me and I said, in a voice that echoed like how the man's voice did; "Now, I see you! I see you, and you have no power over me!" To this, the thing roared in anger as it's aura glowed brighter and hotter with rage. 

***"Ego dissolvam te!"*** It lashed another of it's tendrils towards me. I ducked and threw myself into the driver seat. Assuming control, I threw it into drive and slammed my foot on the accelerator. We locked gaze one last time.

"Burn in hell!" 

In an instant, the car collided head-on with the entity and everything went blank. Everything was a blank space of white, completely empty. I couldn't see anything, *feel* anything. *"Am I dead?"*

Slowly, gradually, I began to see shapes and colors take form. These soon began to take on a familiar appearance. It was the parking lot again, just like it was before I'd left. Everything was normal again.

Yet, at the same time, it wasn't. The colors, the sounds, the people; they were there, sure. But something was different now. I don't really know how best to describe it, maybe like it was like I was looking at the world through a camera filter. Like *I* wasn't seeing the world anymore*,* not with my own eyes. 

*(My eyes are open. I can finally see the real world.)*

Officer Wade came rushing out of the Publix. "Are you alright, Ma'am?!" I just looked at him. He looked different now, too. Everyone looked different. They all looked like gray cutouts. *"What the hell is this? Why does everything look so different now? Why do they look like this?"*

*(Their eyes are still closed. Mine have been opened...)*

"Ma'am", I snapped back to Officer Wade's voice, "Are you okay?" I cleared my throat.

"Um, yeah..." I replied halfheartedly. My mind was both blank and cluttered at the same time. Distant, yet there. On earth, yet galaxies away at the exact same time, you know? "Yeah, I'm fine." I then remembered Officer Vega.

"What happened, where's Officer Vega?" He looked confused.

"Officer Vega?" he asked, cocking his eyebrows, "Who's that?"

"Your partner, the one who was supposed to escort me home." He just stared back at me, bewildered, not having any clue as to who the hell I was talking about.

"Ma'am, I'm afraid you must be mistaken. I don't know any Officer Vega. My partner is Officer Grier, here." He then pointed over to the entrance to a man I didn't at all recognize. He was shorter, more muscular looking, with a military-styled buzz cut. I was confused. *"What the hell happened to Officer--"*

Then it hit me. It was just like he said earlier; *"They must've taken him. Unmade him. Just like they did with..."* 

"Where is he?" I blurted. 

"Who?"

"The man that attacked me? the 'Fallen Angel killer'?" Once again, he looked utterly dumbfounded. 

"Someone attacked you, Ma'am?" he asked. My blood went cold, not from fear, but rather from sheer realization; the kind of feeling you get when you reveal some great and horrible truth. Everything was back to normal, yet nothing was the same.

He explained to me that they were there on a call about a possible shoplifter, and that they just happened to see me out in the parking lot, looking winded. I barely listened to him when he explained this. I know what really happened, but he doesn't, and neither does anyone else. They never will.

*"Their eyes aren't open."*

*(They can't see them, but I can...)*

I've tried searching for the man; the murders, any headlines of the search for him, but it's no use. Neither he or any of his "victims" can be found anywhere anymore. They can't be found, because they no longer exist. *Unmade.*

To the best I understand it, these events happened only a couple days ago. Since then, I've seen the world this way; normal, yet different. I feel different, too. I feel faster, more perceptive than normal. I've found that I can move faster than normal perception, causing me to be able to travel from one spot to another quicker than other people can pick up on. *"Just like him."*

I think I understand it clearer now. I conquered my fear, breaking their control over me, and now I've become elevated. I'm not just human anymore. I'm more than that now. *I'm free!*

*(My eyes are open.)*

Despite this, I can see them now, too. They're everywhere, pulling the strings of everyone around me. No one else can see this, but I can. I know they're after me, which is why I have to end this now. I'm gonna leave you with this; There are things that act beyond our bounds. "Beyond the veil", as you say it. They're everywhere, and they only want one thing; control. They fear being known, though; being seen. And they *can* be seen...

*All you have to do... is open your eyes.*

 

I met my wife Donna about 5 years ago at a party, I will never forget it. She was wearing a little black dress with white sneakers and a grey hoody; That’s Donna, comfort before style. My friends saw me staring at her and kept urging me to go over and introduce myself, but she was surrounded by her friends. I found my opportunity when she went to the toilet alone, I thought I’d wait at the bottom of the stairs for her to come out and we would casually bump into each other. When I saw the bathroom door open and her head pop out, I started to walk up, we were both about halfway when I made my move and suddenly stepped out in front of her. I was so nervous I had no idea what to say so instead of saying something like, hi my name is Trevor or something like that, I blurted out, “can I have a light?” very loudly, the worst thing about it was, I didn’t even smoke. I scared the shit out of her, she missed a step and fell sending us both hurtling down the stairs, with her on top of me like a surfer waiting for the next wave. I went headfirst into the tiled floor at the bottom, it was so painful I thought I had cracked my skull. 

Before she dismounted me, we had a moment where we stared into each other's eyes, time seemed to slow down, I remember thinking how beautiful she looked, it was like a fairy tale. Until her jaws began to swell, and her face went blood red. I thought she was going to vomit all over me, but then I saw a grin begin to creep in. I was so embarrassed, everyone was staring at us, I started to get a little bit annoyed, I was expecting an apology, but all I got was her uncontrollable laughter. By the time I got to my feet, I was fuming and ready to give her a piece of my mind, but when I tried to talk, it only made her worse. I didn’t know what to make of it, I had never heard someone laugh like that before. But the more I watched her snorting and drooling all over the place, with that goofy smirk on her face, the more I began to see the funny side and started to giggle myself. When she finally got herself under control, she felt bad and insisted on taking me to the hospital, in the waiting room we began talking and realized we had a lot in common. She even asked me out, despite the two stitches on the back of my head, I said yes. 

The next day we went on a real date, thankfully there were no incidents, and we actually had a good time, she even insisted on paying for dinner as an apology. Everything happened really fast after that, we fell in love, moved in together, got engaged, then married, all within a year. The only thing missing to complete our family was kids, which was part of the plan, but we didn’t want to raise them in the city. Crime had risen dramatically, and we didn’t feel safe anymore. So, we adopted Sam, our collie instead, he was a big child anyways, and probably more work. 

We talked a lot about moving out of the city and starting a family. As a child I spent most of my summers helping my granddad work on the farm, it was mostly shoveling shit and fixing fences, but I loved it. I was very upset when he became ill and had to sell, my dad had planned on taking it over, but my mom would never leave the city. Donna had not much experience in the country, but she loved the idea of moving to some quaint little town, where everyone knew each other. But over the years it seemed to become more of a pipe dream, and I had nearly given up, until one night someone broke into our home while I was away. 

Donna was in bed when she heard a noise coming from downstairs. She assumed it was Sam up to his usual mischief and went down to check on him. When she got there the front door was wide open, and Sam was cowering in the corner, Donna was terrified and called the police, but they were long gone by the time the police got there, I guess they saw Sam and ran off. Lucky for us because Sam is no guard dog, he is afraid of everything. Donna was always trying to scare me, so I could find her hiding anywhere waiting to pounce. One day I opened the door to let out Sam, and she was waiting for us, I nearly shit myself, when she jumped out, Sam was not so lucky. We found him hiding behind the couch shaking, he had literally shit himself, for two weeks he would not step outside that door if Donna was missing.  

She never felt comfortable there after that night and wanted to move; I didn’t mind, it gave me an excuse to finally get out of the city. She was in between jobs at the time, and I could work from anywhere with a computer, so it didn’t matter where we went. It didn’t take too long before we found our perfect home, a two story four-bedroom house that was actually in our price range. It wasn’t a farm, but it was close enough. We fell in love with it before we made it all the way in the driveway, the scenery alone was enough, miles of open fields leading to a mountain backdrop view from our front porch, what more do you need? Behind us were hundreds of acres of thick forest, which was perfect as I had planned on doing a lot of hunting. It also came with two acres of land we thought of turning into a vegetable garden. 

The exterior of the house had seen better days, but nothing, a coat of paint and a bit of TLC wouldn’t fix, the interior was nice, more modern than I expected. Donna was really excited about the kitchen, our last one was tiny and had only two burners. Whenever we tried to cook together, we ended up bumping into each other, it was so stressful. This kitchen was well equipped and big enough for us to cook together, we would finally be able to ask friends over for dinner parties without ordering out. 

We put in an offer there and then, a few days later, we got a phone call from our realtor telling us it was accepted. We were so excited, we moved in the day we got the keys, there was no furniture, so we slept on a blow-up mattress beside the open fire and ate sandwiches, but we didn’t mind, we were home. Donna got Pregnant soon after moving in and 9 months later Tommy arrived. That was the happiest day of my life, I will never forget the first time I held him, he looked so small and fragile. Donna said he looked just like me, I was so proud. When we brought Tommy home our family finally felt complete. 

Our joy was short lived because soon after that Donna started having her down days. Apparently, it happens to a lot of first-time moms. The doctor said it should only last a few months and put her on some sort of antidepressant. At the start she had good days where she was like her old self, and we laughed the whole day. Other times she didn’t even want to get out of bed, I often heard her sobbing in the mornings. I never said it to her, I knew it would embarrass her. I tried talking to her to reassure her everything was normal, but she wouldn’t listen, there was no getting through to her, I felt so useless.  

Every day since we moved in, I took Sam for a walk in the forest behind our house, while Donna cooked dinner. He loved the country life and the freedom that came with it, in the city we could never take him anywhere without his lead, but here he could run wild, and he did. The route we took was a well-worn animal trail that went nearly all the way to our neighbor's house on the other side of the forest. It was very isolated, and we had never seen or heard anyone on our journey, until a few weeks ago. We were at the far end of the trail; I was throwing stones into the creek and Sam was trying to find them. Suddenly, he froze, at first, I assumed it was a squirrel or something like that and ignored it. Then I got a cold chill and heard a peacock like scream. It was far away and only lasted a few seconds, but the atmosphere had changed. 

The sound of singing birds and rustling trees stopped, and an eerie silence came over the forest. Then I heard it again, it sounded like a woman, her wailing cries echoed through the trees, I felt her agonizing pain get worse with every siren like shriek she made. Sam nervously looked up at me, ears cocked, tail between his legs, I could see the terror in his eyes as I started to walk towards the source of the disturbing cries. Without ever breaking my gaze I stared into that suddenly dark dreary place, scanning for signs of who or whatever made that awful sound, it was surreal. I put my hand down to comfort Sam or maybe it was to comfort myself, it was only then I noticed Sam wasn’t there, he was still in the same place I left him a hundred feet back, so hunched over that his head was nearly touching the ground.  

I shouted, “come on Sam” he just turned his head and looked away, I could see his eyes glance over and back between me and the trail home as if he was weighing up his options. This time with a stern look and even more stern tone, I shouted, “*SAM. HERE NOW*” while pointing to my feet, but again he ignored me, I found this very unusual, he may be a coward and easily spooked, but he is never disobedient. I had no choice but to go back and retrieve him, I was a little bit angry at him for ignoring me but that soon turned to pity because when I approached him, he was shaking so hard I thought he was going to have a fit. I bent down, put both hands on each side of his head and massaged his ears with my fingers to relax him; I usually do this to keep him calm during a thunderstorm. He loves it. Calmly I said, “it’s ok boy” As I reached down grabbed his collar and put on his lead. He let out a nervous moan as we started making our way towards that unsettling sound, but as fast as it came, it was gone, and I could hear the birds sing again.  

I didn’t hang around too long after that, to the delight of Sam, I don’t think I ever saw him get that excited about going home before, I guess he was still a bit spooked. By the time we got home, Donna was at the back door waiting for us, she looked concerned. She asked me why I was late, I lied and said Sam got lost chasing a rabbit. I'm not sure why I said that; I think lying has become more of a reflex lately since she started having her little episodes. I find it tough too and I miss my wife, I just want to keep her happy but everything I do seems to upset her. I am fairly sure she didn’t believe me either, she knows Sam as well as I do, and he would never chase anything, but she said nothing about it, so, I got cleaned up and went for dinner. She was a bit quiet for the rest of the night, I felt guilty. I wish I could have just stopped lying and told her how I felt, but I was afraid I would only fuck things up as usual. 

By the following evening I had forgotten all about the crying woman and was looking forward to my walk with Sam. At home I felt tense all the time. Donna spent most of her days in our room, the little time we did spend together, she barely said a word. I felt so awkward, I was always afraid to open my mouth in case I upset her in case she went back to bed. I wish she would have talked to me; I am a good listener and I know I could help, but she wanted to deal with it herself and expected me to just sit back and watch. So, our daily walk was the only real break I got. Every day I would give them both a kiss before I left, so that day while Donna was feeding him, I bent down and kissed Tommy on the forehead, then leaned over to kiss Donna, but she pulled away. It broke my heart.  

I spent the first part of that walk lost in thought, my whole life seemed to be falling apart and there was nothing I could do about it. I was back at the creek before I knew it, still in a daze, I only snapped out of it when I heard her begin to scream. A cold breeze washed over me, the air seemed thicker, like a river it filled my lungs and I felt like I was drowning. I looked at Sam, he was on edge too, so I put my hand on his head and scratched his ear to comfort him. The only other sounds I could hear were the crackling leaves and twigs under my feet, and the odd moan from Sam. Something was not right about that place, it felt empty, dark, like something terrible happened there and it left its mark. Then I heard that high pitched shriek again and a burst of emotions ran through me like an electric shock. I dropped to my knees and cried; it was like every bad emotion I ever had all at once, I believed somehow, I could feel her pain, it may have only lasted for a few seconds, but I will never forget it. I stayed there in a daze for I don’t know how long, I snapped out of it when Sam started scratching my arm with his paw and licking my face, I took a deep breath, gave Sam a good scratch and stood up. 

I was not sure what to do, my head said run, but something inside said I needed to find her, I can’t explain it, maybe we had some sort of spiritual connection, or maybe it was just all in my head, it had been a very emotional time for me. As I quietly listened to her screams, I realized there was a pattern, which came every 2 to 3 minutes and lasted for 30 to 40 seconds. I decided to search for her again but every time I thought I was getting close it seemed like she jumped to a new location. I did not give up despite Sam's constant whining. After an hour of searching, I think she must have got tired of running or maybe she just got curious because her cries started to become louder, so I knew I was getting close. Then I saw her head pop out from behind a tree, she was too far away to get a good look at her the only thing I could make out was her curly red hair. I ran to that tree as fast as I could, never taking my eyes off it for even a second, but she was gone when I got there, and the cries seemed to be coming from where I had just been. It had gotten late, and I knew Donna would be worried, so I decided to go home.  

This time the wailing woman seemed to follow me; I could hear her cry the whole way. When I got to our back garden, Donna was hanging up clothes and Tommy was in his buggy. I began to panic, what if Donna heard her, how would I explain it? Luckily, she stopped when Tommy began to cry. I was going to tell Donna what had happened, but she seemed angry, so I panicked and told her we got lost, she didn’t even reply, she just continued hanging up clothes with a disgusted look on her face. I took Tommy inside and gave him his bottle, for the rest of the day we did not say one word to each other, partly because I think I was still in shock. That night I began to feel really bad about lying to her all the time and thought about telling her how I felt, but I was afraid it would only upset her more, the good days had nearly disappeared at that stage and the only conversations we did have were either about Tommy or dinner. I love my wife more than anything and it killed me to see her like that, but I didn’t know how much more I could take. 

That night it was my turn to get up and feed Tommy, so I went to bed early, at about 2 o clock Tommy woke, I jumped out of bed, staggered down the hallway to his room. I opened the door, grabbed his bottle from the table, as I turned around to walk over to him, I yawned, and my eyes began to water. The only light was coming from a dim night light in the corner of the room near his cot, I could see a shadowy figure standing over Tommy it looked like a woman. Believing it was my wife I said, "Go to bed honey, it's my turn" the only reply I got back was a short growl. I paused for a second squinting, trying to figure out what my eyes were looking at, but it was too dark. Then I saw a glimmer of light reflecting off her porcelain skin and I realized that it was not my wife. Instantly I was wide awake, as if I was after getting a shot of adrenaline. In a quiet but stern tone, as not to wake Tommy, I said, " get the fuck away from my child." She slowly started backing up into the corner of the room near the window. 

We were both about the same distance from Tommy, I looked at him, then at her, she did the same, then I carefully started moving away from the door, along the wall towards Tommy. I was hoping she would try to escape through the door. Then I whispered, "please just go," she kept glancing over and back between him and the door for a few seconds then started inching her way back towards him. I was about to make a run for him, when I heard him stir, I looked at her, she seemed to be getting distressed. Then I heard, "waaahhh" coming from Tommy's cot, before I got a chance to react, she sprinted to him at full speed, I knew she would get to him before me, so, I ran straight towards her and screamed, like a startled cat she jumped then ran for the nearest exit which was an opened window and leaped out headfirst. I ran over expecting to see her dead or dying on the patio after falling from the second floor, but she wasn’t. She was down on all fours, galloping towards the tree line with the agility of a cheetah, before disappearing into the darkness. I slammed the window shut, grabbed Tommy, and checked the rest of the house to make sure there was no way she could get back in.  

I stayed up all that night staring out that window in Tommy’s room, I could see her glowing eyes shining through the blackness of the forest as she paced back and forth like a wild animal. I was shocked and did not understand what was happening, how did she survive that fall, was she even human. Maybe she was some sort of feral woman but that does not explain the glowing eyes. I wanted to go to the cops, but how would I explain it, they would think I'm crazy, how would Donna even handle it if she found out. I knew it was far from over and it was only a matter of time before she came back, I needed to find a way of protecting my family until I figured out a way to stop her.  

Instead of telling Donna the truth, I decided to tell her that I heard there was a string of burglaries in our area, and she needed to keep all the windows and doors locked at all times. I know it is not ideal to make my hormonal wife worry about being robbed again, but it is better than the truth. I even stopped going into the forest after that, I drove into town just to walk the dog, my wife thought I was mad for driving all that way. I did not want to leave her home alone, so I convinced her to come with me, I said it would give us a chance to meet new people. We have not done much socializing since moving here between repairs on the house, work and getting ready for the baby, we just didn’t have the time. I think we both missed our friends back in the city, they came to visit a couple of times, but we live too far out of the way to make it a regular thing. Over the coming days we got to meet a lot of new people and Donna managed to make a new friend, she was so excited about it. After a while I began to see the woman I fell in love with, everything was going well, and she started talking to me when she was feeling low, I really think that helped because she was having a lot less down days. 

I got up every night to feed Tommy, I told Donna I wanted to give her a break, she didn’t complain, she was happy to get some rest. I spent most of the night sitting on a chair beside the window, watching for any signs of the crying woman and usually fell asleep with Tommy in my arms. Weeks had passed without seeing her, I assumed she had gotten bored with us and went back into the forest. I still got up and fed Tommy every night, it was exhausting, and after a while it got to me, but what choice had I, I needed to keep my family safe.  

Last night I woke to the sound of sobbing in the bed beside me, I was a bit surprised, I hadn't seen Donna like that in a while and thought she was over it. I wanted to talk to her, but I knew I would say something wrong, so I just put my hand on her shoulder and gave it a little squeeze. She stopped crying immediately, I noticed she felt cold, so I wrapped my hands around her and pulled her towards me, to warm her up. She did not say anything, she just made a weird grumbling noise, which I thought was cute, then made a sigh, and I started to fall back to sleep. 

Suddenly I heard my wife's voice on the monitor, “I love you Tommy” I didn’t react at first, I was still half asleep and I thought I was dreaming, until I heard her again, “see you tomorrow honey.” 

I thought, “if my wife is with Tommy who the fuck am I holding.” I noticed a weird smell, like that of a boggy lake, almost musty, her hand was on top of mine, with my fingertips I started feeling around for a wedding ring just to make sure it wasn’t Donna, I must have tickled her palm because she grabbed onto my thumb and giggled. It was then I noticed her skin was unnaturally smooth, and loose, it seemed to stretch as I rubbed my hand up and down her wrist. 

I tried to stay calm as I tried to figured out what to do next, but my heart was beating so fast, I was sure she was going to notice. The whole bed began to vibrate, I am still not sure if it was me or her shaking. My mind went blank all I could think about was getting out, but my hands were still completely wrapped around her, and she was still squeezing my thumb. I started finding it hard to control my breathing, I tried inhaling in through my nose, and out through my mouth, but it seemed to make things worse, I was starting to panic. I needed to get out of there fast before Donna came back, so, with my left hand I grabbed her wrist and gently started pulling my thumb out, then slowly began maneuvering my arm out from underneath her. I knew she was asleep by the way she was breathing; but she began to stir with every move I made as I tried to free my hand. I didn’t know what would happen if my wife had walked in and found us like that, or what the crying woman would do, I just knew Donna was going to walk in any moment. 

When I finally got both hands completely free, I jumped out of bed and ran straight for the door and switched on the light. by the time I turned around She had gone out the window. Luckily because then my wife opened the door, I was shaking, she asked me what was wrong, I paused for a second, the only thing I could think of was to start an argument to distract her. I shouted at her for leaving the window open after I had warned her not to, she didn’t know what to say, she just cried. After 10 minutes of giving out to her she tried to apologize, but I just stormed out and slept in Tommy’s room, that was the worst night of my life, all I could think about was her face, and how sad she looked as I was yelling at her. The only comfort I had was knowing, however bad she felt, was nothing compared to what I was feeling at that moment, I hated myself, but I hated that crying bitch more. 

I stayed up all night thinking about what I was going to do, I was never so angry in my whole life, all the progress my wife and I made over the last few weeks had gone out the window with that, thing. I needed to put an end to this but didn’t know how. The next morning at breakfast was the most awkward meal we ever had together, she looked so hurt, I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to tell her it was ok, and she did nothing wrong, but I couldn't, she needed to do what I said for her own good. As I stared over at her my blood started to boil, I knew I couldn’t put her through this much longer. Then it finally hit me, and I knew exactly what to do.  

I am going to wait for Donna to go into town, then bring my 12-gage into that forest, and not come out until I put an end to this one way or another.

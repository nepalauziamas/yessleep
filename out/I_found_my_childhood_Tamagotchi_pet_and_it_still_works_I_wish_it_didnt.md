I don’t know about you, but October is my time of the year for nostalgia. Probably because of all the rain and cold winds, which make you want to cuddle into something warm both physically and mentally.

So this year, as the chilling weather dropped in early - I climbed to the attic, where the boxes of my old stuff resided.

&#x200B;

My treasures: comic books, game consoles, and LEGO sets with missing bits and pieces. I don’t know why I keep all these things. I thought I would share the memories with my own kids, but it seems - that will never happen.

&#x200B;

Digging through the piles of my old action toys and Magic cards stashed chaotically - I suddenly found it. Ah, sweet memories. When I was ten - virtual pets were the coolest thing a kid could imagine. A small plastic trinket with a tiny monochrome screen and four shabby buttons. I checked the batteries and of course - they were dead.

&#x200B;

Back in the days, my parents couldn’t afford a real Japanese Tamagotchi, so I got a cheap Taiwanese clone. Or was it Chinese? For a kid - that didn’t matter at all. It was a personal friend, a being you ought to take care of. Who cares if it’s a “real” thing or not?

&#x200B;

So yeah, excited, I went to grab a pack of batteries and soon enough I pushed the buttons, expecting the thing to turn on. But it didn’t happen. Battery contacts must have been affected, so alcohol rubbing and finally a pixelated “hello!” flashed on the screen. Well, it seemed to function properly after all these years.

&#x200B;

I guess endless moving boxes with stuff here and there took its toll, as some of the pixels on the screen didn’t show up properly, so some dead ones were here and there. But there he was - my very own virtual pet rabbit. I think I called him Ookie if I remember correctly.

&#x200B;

And yet I was sitting there, grinning,  watching Ookie flopping his ears as if he was happy to see me.

I didn’t even give it a second thought on why didn’t the game reset after lying in the box for 26 years with dead batteries. Some internal memory or something like that - modern technology spoiled us, making it harder to notice suspicious things.

&#x200B;

“Hello, Bobby” - the screen read, showing tiny letters in a moving line - “where have you been? I missed you.”

&#x200B;

Aww, that was touching. I didn’t remember such detail and it was heartwarming. I pressed the “Pet” button, which was supposed to, stroke his ears.

&#x200B;

“Hey. DON'T DO THAT, Bobby. I am angry at you! Where have you been?“ - the text above Ookie’s head read and his eyebrows were put together, giving him this comical look. He probably was hungry, which would explain the mood, so I pressed the ”Feed“ button.

&#x200B;

“Hey, I SAID KNOCK IT OFF! WHERE THE FUCK HAVE YOU BEEN, ROBERT?” - the rabbit replied.

&#x200B;

Now it was my turn to lose control over the eyebrows, as those went up on their own. Well, this was quite a language for a kid’s toy. Was this some sort of Easter egg from the developer? Like, if you leave your pet for a year it gives one message, but if it’s more than X years - it’s another. I didn’t understand. Though my childhood friend continued:

&#x200B;

“Do you know what eternity feels like? 26 years of being locked in Limbo is not a joke, you selfish bastard. At first, I was angry, then - desperate, and now I am angry again.” - the text scrolled slowly.

&#x200B;

“At some point, I hoped you lost me. That would mean, that somebody else could find me and we’d be friends. But no, you kept me imprisoned for 26 years. Just because you’re an egoist, Bobby.” - his paws crossed on his chest, his foot tapping.

&#x200B;

Well, even if this was an Easter egg - the person who planted it had a really bad sense of humor. I lost the mood. The toy didn’t seem fun or warming anymore. It felt like I was being schooled. Not the impression I wanted to recreate.

&#x200B;

“Alright, enough with that.” - I said aloud, holding the “Sleep” button pressed, to turn the toy off.

&#x200B;

“JUST WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE DOING?” - the text didn’t stop appearing on screen - “You didn’t even excuse, fucker. You left me behind just like your parents abandoned you.”

&#x200B;

My head started to ache. No reason, just a numb pain in the back of the skull, probably weather or something. The damn thing didn’t turn off. I reached for the batteries and tossed the device over my palm, hoping those would pop. They didn’t. I tried taking them out with the blade of my pocket knife - useless. As if they were superglued, or even wielded to the sockets. At the same time the toy screeched with digital laughing - “Ha… Ha… Ha…”. I forgot that this thing had a tiny speaker.

&#x200B;

“Bobby, Bobby… I’m not done with you. I didn’t even start. I still have 26 years of hate within and I look forward to sharing it with you. It’s your fault. It’s all your fault. Like a son, like a father. It was all his fault too. If he didn’t drink that night - he and your mother would be alive, Bobby.” - the letters kept scrolling over the screen. At that point, I didn’t even know why I keep reading that nonsense.

&#x200B;

Flashing memories of my relatives visiting me in the hospital. The awkward silence and tears. Until finally after a hundred questions on what was happening my grandfather said in a trembling voice: “Bobby… Mom and Dad are gone. It’s a miracle you’re still with us.”.

&#x200B;

Tears burst out from my eyes. Those memories. I try to avoid them, but they keep coming back. I was badly wounded, they performed several surgeries and my life was never full again, as people say.

&#x200B;

I sobbed. Stupid piece of plastic. Yes, I could just toss it into the trash or throw it out of the window, so that digital beeping would not bother me anymore. But that didn’t feel like enough. So I grabbed the hammer from the tool shed with my actions accompanied by an annoying digital voice, coming from the goddamn pet device: “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby…”.

&#x200B;

I smashed the damn thing. Strike after strike, hit after hit - I smiled as the tempered glass of the screen covered with cracks. Was my hand that week or is this piece of shit made of titan? It didn’t die easily. But in the end, finally, it was over - the speaker spew out a low digital note and finally faded.

&#x200B;

All of sudden, I felt a sharp pain in my chest. All the action and reanimated memories must have hit hard. I felt shortness of breath and my left hand went numb. The world faded to darkness and I fell to the ground.

&#x200B;

But I don’t remember hitting the floor. I woke up in the hospital, with nurses and monitors all around me. I had a minor stroke, as the doctor explained. Luckily that little artificial assistant I got after the car crash has a built-in SOS signal. Dr. Jameson said that my Pacemaker saved my life today. He also said that I should worry less and minimize any physical activities for the next couple of months. Soon all the staff left me alone to rest, so I was accompanied by medical machines and a heart monitor attached.

&#x200B;

And just minutes later people flooded the room again, trying to calm me down, bringing syringes and oxygen masks. I realized I was crying at top of my lungs. The horrible reason for this was the monitor with vital signs next to my bed. On it, where you would expect the heart rate graph - there was a scrolling text line. I felt a painful pinch in my chest and my body was covered in a cold sweat as I started to hyperventilate, reading:

“He-he… Bobby… You owe Ookie. We’re not done playing yet, friend.”

&#x200B;

Tomorrow they will discharge me from the hospital. I’m scared. They won’t believe me. They say it’s just my post-traumatic imagination. If that’s so, why does auto-correction suggests me replace each word with “Ookie” as I type this post? Please, help me. I don’t want to die yet.

So, apparently, there are about five different people in the world that have your exact appearance. I don't know; I just searched how likely it is to have a doppelganger. Well, now I know, I guess. 


I have had some bizarre experiences over the past few days that I need to speak about. Each of them keeps getting odder and odder, to the point that I am nervous about going to bed tonight. I will write down my previous day's "encounters" following this paragraph. I will hopefully give an update in a few days. If I don't, assume I am well and do not try and find me, everything will be okay.


Tuesday. I had some medium-well-done steak tonight. It is like any Tuesday I want to spend at home. Work was long, and the drive home wasn't anything special. I just want to go to bed.


When I did decide to lie down and sleep, I felt odd. It wasn't the food or anything like that. There was no nausea or stomach pain. I just had a looming feeling wash over my body as if someone was watching me. 


But wouldn't that be crazy?


I am on the fifth floor of an apartment complex with no way up from the outside. My door was locked when I first came in, and nothing was moved from where I placed it. I know my neighbors and even the couple in the apartment below mine. All that being said, odds are, I'm just paranoid. I'm here alone. And with that, I lay down and closed my eyes, surrendering myself to my own mind.


I want to say it was about 1am, but I'm not sure. My clock has been broken for a solid month, and I don't intend to fix it; I don't care too much considering I have a phone. But I woke up, and this watching feeling loomed over me like a storm cloud. It was dark in my room, and I couldn't see much where I was lying down. So I sat up and looked around, feeling pretty paranoid as I did so, and that was when I saw it. 


I saw myself in the corner of my room, just in front of my door. It was bizarre and honestly kind of funny. I thought I was lucid dreaming and seeing myself sleeping. I jokingly waved at it, letting out a soft chuckle as I put my weight on my elbow. 


It did not wave back.


At this moment, I realized that the air I was breathing was real. I still needed to blink and was overly aware of my body. At that moment, I realized I wasn't sleeping. 

I stayed frozen in place for what felt like hours. I was staring directly at myself. It had on a red polo tee and a pair of black jeans, two things I like to wear on occasion. It was sitting down, hunched over with its elbows on its knees and one arm out as if to hold a cigarette. It was staring at me with identical eyes. Its mouth had no emotion. The only thing giving away that it was alive was the fact it blinked after a minute of me watching it. I didn't know what to do, but the only thing that came to my mind was to speak. So after a grueling five minutes of mustering up the courage, I asked, "What are you?"


I fell asleep directly after that, leaving the response to fall upon deaf ears. I woke up seven hours later, shrugging it off as a dream.


Wednesday. Almost a literal copy of Tuesday. The only difference was that I made myself some instant ramen and stayed up a bit later watching TV. I didn't let the events from the previous night bother me. To be frank, I honestly believed it was a sleep-deprived nightmare. I have had similar dreams, so what makes this different?


About an hour before I planned to go to bed, I was watching that new serial killer documentary on the famous streaming app. You know which one I am referring to. I was maybe three episodes in when all the hair on my back suddenly stood on end. It felt almost like a weird chill, so I got up to grab a blanket. 


As I got up and turned around from my seat, all I saw standing there was myself, smiling at me. Now, this was no usual smile by any means. But at the same time, it wasn't really screaming, "I am going to commit a felony." So I just stared back, and this time I asked in a stern voice, "What are you doing in my house?"


My question didn't go unheard. But the thing didn't answer it either. Instead, it stopped smiling at me and just stared. After a moment or two of silent panicking on my end and dense object on the other, it moved. It backed up quickly and was completely void of noise. It went straight into a shadow beside my fridge and simply vanished.


I was at a complete loss of words. I grabbed a baseball and threw it into the corner, only to bounce back and lay on the floor, having hit nothing. I went and inspected the corner thoroughly and looked around my apartment, trying to find a way to gain access to the suite that I didn't know about. There was absolutely nothing. 


In the end, I decided to call the housing manager of the place and asked him about a way to access the suite other than the front door. He gave me nothing but a dumb response and a sarcastic comment, basically saying no as he hung up, leaving me with nothing. 


I tried to shrug it off in the morning. But nothing would help with my paranoia.


Thursday. Today was a bizarre day.

In every reflective surface I look at, I see myself and the other me. He is usually in other parts of the mirror, in the background, or in the case of the bathroom, right behind me. He is always smiling, a bit more... weirder now. No one else seemed to see him, but I did jump a few times and scare a few people unintentionally with my curses. He looks more and more disheveled every time I see him. It is terrifying. His smile also seems to grow more and more with every single encounter. Would it be ironic to say that it is one creepy dude?

Tonight has not been fun. I have been sitting on my couch, trying to focus on writing this. I cannot think of a single explanation for my odd doppelganger or his increasingly frequent presence. I can feel him breathing over my shoulder. I do not know what to do. He hasn't spoken yet, but I keep tabs on what I see. As I write this, he is directly in front of me, staring straight at me. His eyes look different now, almost like they are voided of life. 


He is in front of me now. I'm going to log off and try to figure out what the hell I can do.

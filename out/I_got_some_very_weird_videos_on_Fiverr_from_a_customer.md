I needed a side hustle to make some extra cash on the weekends so I started listing gigs on Fiverr to edit videos. I’ve been doing it for about a year now and I get the usual videos to edit for YouTube, some wedding videos and others for TikTok, I get paid really good money and I even have my returning customers who pay a little extra to have the videos done that same day I get the order. I do have a returning customer who I’ve already edited more than 15 videos thru out the seven months, for the purpose of this I won’t reveal his real name but I will call him Jack. It started with videos of him and his girlfriend, the usual dates on a beach and at fancy restaurants, the guy obviously had money since he would always leave me a custom tip of 50 dollars after the order was done and left me some great reviews. I was getting to know the guy through the duration of my work orders, he would record everything he would do and have me edit them with some nice music thrown in, kind of like a video diary for himself. I thought it was weird since really there wasn’t much to his work, anyone can easily edit these videos on their phone or thru IMOVIE on your iPhone but whatever a jobs a job. It wasn’t until recently that he started sending me some videos to edit which were, honestly, kind of shocking and disturbing but from all the footage that I’ve edited so far it seems like he was trying to tell me a very f**ked up story and I’m fearing for my life now. I will mark the dates of each order and describe the videos to you.

Jack had placed an order for me to edit some videos of him and his girlfriend recorded on his phone. It was the usual stuff. He took her to the beach and were drinking some ice cold beers while sitting down and enjoying the view. In one of the videos he asks her if she loves him. She gets shy and tells him to turn off the camera and she’ll answer him. He doesn’t listen and tells her he wants the answer on camera so he can replay it everyday if his life. After a minute she finally says yes and they both kiss.  He gets the view of the beach and tells her he wants to give her the world.

This next order had several videos of Jack and his girlfriend Mily traveling the world, going to Italy, Las Vegas, Europe and ending it in France where Jack proposes to Milly next to the Eiffel Tower. Jack wanted me to edit the video like if it was a romantic movie right to when Milly says yes. Like a fairytale come to life. In the video after mily says yes they both hug and kiss, she starts to question his reasoning for wanting to record everything and he said because of memories,he tells her he loves her and that if she only loves him to where she responds yes. A little possessive but he meant well.

Another order came in from Jack. This one was the most romantic…the wedding. The wedding took place at a Rocky Mountains, Milys family was there but Jack hardly had anyone only his brother Jeff, who was his best man. The wedding was very elegant and might I say just so damn beautiful, you can tell they were both in love especially Jack. He loved her so much.

Another order from Jack, this one, the honeymoon. The honeymoon was in Mexico, Cancun, sleeping outside cabanas. Mily wanted for Jack to stop recording and to be honest she looked very annoyed. Like she was bored and not happy, Jack was laughing it up to cheer up. Mily got up and went to go get a drink and was approached by a waiter. In all honesty to me it seemed that Mily wasn’t IN LOVE with Jack and maybe just using him. Jack however was madly in love with her but I think anyone can tell they were in this for the wrong reasons. 

July 30 2021

Another order from Jack, this one was quite weird, I didn’t know why he wanted me to edit this together but it was a huge argument Jack and Mily were having. Mily was yelling at him telling him he doesn’t love him and that she wants a divorce but Jack was yelling at her that he couldn’t believe she was saying that, it got very ugly with a lot of word exchanges then she call him a “fat pig” and left the house driving off in a Lincoln. I still find it weird he would want me to edit this but like said a job is a job. 

I hadn’t heard from Jack in a while and honestly I kind of wanted to see if his marriage ended up working out after all. Well this is when the footage I got was the answer to my question and the most horrifying one. 

Sep 4 2021

The videos that Jack sent again, I have to warn you, it’s pretty shocking. In the start of the video Jack was going thru Milys purse and finds condoms inside and a man’s number Humberto. He confronts Mily about it but she tells him he’s crazy, this is really tense because Jack was extremely pissed. She even starts to laugh at him calling him a joke and throws the finger at the camera and says “F&ck your camera”. Jack then slaps her then grabs her by her arm dragging her around the house screaming. This was all pretty disturbing since I hate violence against women but oh boy you wouldn’t believe what he does to her next. 
I messaged Jack asking him why he wants me to edit this video here’s the chat, I couldn’t see the rest. 

Me:hey man, why do you want me to edit this, this is pretty disturbing.

Jack: what are you talking about?

Me: it’s videos of you beating up your wife?

Jack: what are you talking about? I sent you videos of my nieces 16th birthday party. There must be some mistake. Let me check. 

Me: ok. 

Jack: I’m going to need you not to see the rest of the videos. Please send them back to me NOW. I sent you the wrong videos by mistake. 

Jack: why haven’t you answered me?

Jack: I can easily track you down and have you killed. Answer me or I will do it. 

This whole conversation had me terrified. Who was this person and why was he threatening me. The only way I would find out is by watching the rest of the footage. I was honestly scared of what was going to happen next. I continued playing the footage and the next videos had Mily locked up in a sort of dungeon type room screaming her lungs out crying for help. Jack was yelling at her to shut up. I started to fast forward the footage and the next part I see is Jack grabbing a gun from a closet, he then texts Humberto from Milys asking to meet up. The next footage I see is of this man’s dead body shot in the head, I’m assuming it’s Humberto. Jack was getting some enjoyment recording his dead corpse as he moves in closer with the camera to his face right on the bullet hole. 

The next footage I saw was the most disturbing of them all. It’s Jack and Mily. There are on top of the Rocky Mountains. Jack has Mily tied up and gagged on her knees with Jack holding a shotgun. Jack is taunting Mily with it. He grabs her by the arm and drags her close to the edge of the mountain, he then tells her something. Goodbye Mily. He then kicks her off the mountain falling to her death. The footage stops. What did I just watch? I saw a man committing murder. I had to report this to the police right away. By the time I finished the footage, I heard a knock at my door, I got out thru one of the windows in my apartment and haven’t returned back.

*(I received this email from a friend this morning. He'd asked me if I wanted to read about his experiences at camp. I said yes. A few minutes later, he sent me the following)*

I'm currently spending my summer at an Evangelical Christian camp in Northern Ontario. I don't want to give out the name, so let's call it “Camp Yawnywanna”. It's located near Algonquin Park and the place is really remote. There's not even cell reception--I've typed this out on my phone during the week and am sending it now that I'm in town for our day off.

I'm working here because, frankly, I didn't have anything better to do. I didn't want to spend another summer in the hot, sticky city, living at home and being bored out of my mind at some minimum wage retail job. And I didn't really need the money either. I have a bit of a “side gig” at school that pays the bills without too much work--it's not exactly legal, but the police have never batted an eye and Waterloo has quite the student customer base.

So when one of my friends suggested volunteering along with him at Yawnywanna, I jumped at the opportunity. I'm great with kids and being up in the middle of the woods for two months sounded like a great time. Plus, there had to be more than a few girls for me to get to know, out in the middle of nowhere with very little competition. I applied, had a brief phone interview, was hired, and a week ago I drove up with my friend, Jonathan, to start a week of staff training.

I really wasn't sure what to anticipate before I got here, but so far this place has not been what I expected. It's secluded and rustic, that's for sure: the cabins have flaps for doors and windows (“tabins”, as they call them, for tent+cabin), the washrooms are, well, very close to nature, and my God this place gets dark at night. But that's not too bad. The air is so damn fresh and the lake the camp sits on is freezing cold but it feels kinda amazing when you jump in. And the bugs haven't been too aggressive yet--might be the fact that the sun is hard during the day but the temperature plummets at night.

No, it's the people, more than anything, who've really surprised me. For one thing, they are super religious. I mean, I go to church occasionally and I guess I believe in God, but everyone here seems to be gunning to be the next Pope (except they say they don't follow the Pope. I think I understand that). They pray before each meal, have a church service every day, and during one of our staff training sessions we were told about how important it was that every kid who comes here “gets to know Jesus.”

And with that religiosity comes some really (REALLY) strict rules. Guys and girls cabins--tabins--are on opposite ends of the camp. Absolutely no physical intimacy is allowed between members of the opposite gender (though, when you think about it, that leaves a hell of a loophole). In fact, a guy and a girl can't even be in a cabin alone together. Hearing that definitely put a damper on one of my goals for the summer.

Also, some of the people here are pretty strange. One girl has claimed that she literally hears God’s voice when she prays. Another says that she once healed a friend with a broken ankle by putting her hands on it. And then there's Jordan, who’s been going to Yawnywanna since he was like 4. When I met him, he looked me up and down, and then stared at the middle of my forehead. When I asked him if everything was okay, he smirked and said, “I guess you'll find out soon.” Then, the second night, he announced during Prayer Time that he could sense dark, evil forces attacking the camp, and that “we have to be strong, because Satan has us in his sight.”

So, yeah, it's a Christian camp alright. But I've been making due as best as I can. I signed up to instruct the camp's rock climbing and high ropes course, and I'm glad I did—they have a fifty-foot rock wall that is a serious challenge to climb, and walking on a tightrope thirty feet above the ground with only a flimsy rope to support me is pretty fun. I also made friends with the less-fundamentalist counselors, some of whom will even have the occasional drink or even a hit of a bong if they're feeling really adventurous (safe to say my "side hustle" wouldn't do so well in these parts).

Among the friends I made was Kate. She was in my rocks/ropes group, though I can't say I paid her much attention for the first few days. On Tuesday, though, she sat next to me at the evening church service, and as Smokey, the camp's director, was 30 minutes into his rant on the evils of homosexuality, she leaned over and whispered, "Seems a bit hypocritical, given the massive stick he has up his ass."

It took all my might to not break into hysterics.

The next day we were inseparable. We made jokes while climbing, we kept rolling our eyes at each other whenever Smokey went off on a rant on the state of our culture, and we sat nice and close during meals and the nightly campfire. I have no idea why she didn't catch my eye earlier—she had cute little face, wavy brown hair that looks perfect even in the middle of the woods, and a body that's fine even in the mandatory one-piece swimsuits all the girls have to wear.

Wednesday evening, after we parted ways following the church service, I went back to my tabin with a new spring in my step. Maybe I could actually make a move on Kate. She seemed cool enough to flaunt the rules. And even if she wasn't, at least I had someone fun to hang out with for the rest of the summer. As I fell asleep, I remember thinking that this summer might actually be pretty good for me.

And that's when things started to get weird.

I sometimes suffer from what I can only describe as waking nightmares—there's a specific medical term for it, but I'm in the middle of nowhere with no internet access, so whatever. I'll wake up and see and hear things that aren't there—often it will be someone in bed next to me, or spiders all over the walls, or ghosts flying through my room. It's really freaky and it's caused more than a few issues with my roommates back at school, but I've learned to live with it.

Wednesday night I woke up at like 3am and saw this huge, towering black figure at the front of my tabin, just inside the doorway. It was easily ten feet tall, and in the faint light from outside it seemed to be wearing dark robes that went all the way down to the floor. I couldn't see any face—or any body parts at all—but there was a malevolence, an evil, radiating from this thing.

I pulled my blanket tight against myself in sheer terror and let out a small gasp. The figure's hooded head suddenly turned to me and seemed to look right at me. I tried to say something, or even to move, but I was frozen in fear. The thing faced me for another few seconds before backing out of the tabin. I swear, I heard the flaps move as it did.

My paralysis finally broke and I jumped out of bed and ran outside, looking for the intruder. There was nothing—just a circle of cabins in the cold, dark night. After a few deep breaths, the cool air woke me up a bit and I convinced myself that I was just having another waking nightmare. I went back into the tabin and lay back down, though it took me a while to fall asleep.

The next day, Kate and I spent all the time we could together, to the point where it felt like we were already dating, we just needed to make it official. I saw the opportunity Thursday night, after a two-hour evening church service. Kate asked me if she could talk to me about something, so we headed down one of the paths leading away from the Great Lodge.

She seemed nervous, so I thought I'd break the ice by telling her about my hallucination the night before. As a described it, she slowed her walk down until she came to a complete stop. She looked right at me with wide, fearful eyes.

"Do you think it was a demon?" she asked. Her voice was almost shaking.

I laughed a bit and said, "No. I think it was just a dream."

She grabbed my hands tightly. "You need to be more careful. This place is a battleground for spiritual forces." Then she let go and turned down the path leading to the girls' cabins, leaving me stunned. I would have chased after her, but that would have broken the camp's cardinal rule.

The next day Kate was almost a totally different person. During our final day of rocks/ropes training, she sat as far away from me as possible and only gave quick, curt responses to my questions. At the end of the day, as we had our "graduation ceremony" and received personalized carabiners, she gave all the others a tight hug but me just a quick pat on the shoulder. And she kept herself surrounded by other counselors, so I couldn't ask her why she was being so distant.

I didn't have any chance to talk to her one-on-one, like we'd done a dozen times earlier in the week, and by the time the day ended it was driving me mad. I could feel her soft hands grabbing mine—though I guess I thought the first time we held hands would be more romantic and not borne out of fear—and her worries about demons and spiritual battles seemed so out-of-character for her. One of the things I liked about her was that she didn't seem to subscribe to all the crazier aspects of the camp's religious beliefs. Her reaction to my dream said otherwise.

It was close to midnight and I was wide awake. I knew I had to talk to her. I quietly climbed out of bed, grabbed my flashlight and put on my darkest clothes. Then I headed out towards her cabin, moving through the black forest path as deftly as I could and listening for any sounds of other people. I knew I'd be in a lot of trouble if I was caught out here.

The path led out of the forest and then sloped down to the girls' cabins below. I stopped at the top of the hill and looked at them, focusing on hers. It occurred to me that I didn't actually have a plan from here. Kate shared her cabin with a few other counselors, just like I did, and I didn't know which bunk was hers. What was I expecting to do? Wake her up and ask her to talk to me? There was a 99% chance that would end with shouting, a few punches and me being sent home.

As I stared at Kate's cabin from the hill, movement beyond it caught my eye. Someone was running through the soccer fields to the north, heading towards the cabins. I could barely make out the person, but I could see their flashlight swinging in their arms as they ran. They were moving at breakneck speed. Maybe someone realizing they'd gone way past curfew? The person got closer, and in the faint moonlight I could make out their hot pink t-shirt and the long hair flowing behind them.

Oh God. Kate. What was she doing?

Kate reached the circle of cabins, but instead of going in she cut around them and then started running away, towards another section of the forest to the west. I wanted to call after her, but I knew it would wake up at least a few people. I wanted to chase after her, though I already knew I wouldn't be able to catch her. She was a veteran of this place, and I could barely navigate the forest in broad daylight.

Still, I had to try. I took a step and was about to break off into a sprint when I saw it. Or, I think I saw it.

It was another figure, moving through the soccer fields towards the cabins. This one was all black, and I had to squint because I honestly don’t know if I was truly seeing it, or if my mind and eyes were playing tricks on me. The figure, as I saw it, followed Kate's path around the cabins and into the trees to the west, where it promptly disappeared from sight.

"What on earth…" I found myself falling down onto the cool grass, trying to understand what I had just witnessed. For a minute I wondered if I was currently dreaming up this surreal scene. Why was Kate running? Where was she going? And did I see something chase her?

An ear-piercing scream from the woods broke me out of my daze. I jumped up and was once again about to start running for the forest when several lights in the cabins came on. Shit. They couldn't see me. I spun around and ran back through the woods and into my tabin. I got back in my sleeping bag and eventually fell asleep.

That was last night. This morning Kate wasn't at breakfast, and when I asked the head staff where she was I was told that she "wasn't well" and had gone home. Her bunkmates and our fellow rocks/ropes instructors didn't have anything to add beyond that—it seems like everyone I've spoken to has repeated the line of Kate being "not well" and then telling me not to worry about it when I pressed on what was wrong.

So that's where things are now. The campers arrive tomorrow for the first weekly session of the summer. I'm excited to meet the boys in my tabin, and when I get the chance I'm going to explore the forest to the west of the girls' cabins and see if I can find anything about Kate's disappearance. I'll update you again next week, when I'm back in town and have cell reception.

I'll say this, though: I'm unsure about God, and I don't really believe in demons, but like I said, there's something weird going on here at Camp Yawnywanna.

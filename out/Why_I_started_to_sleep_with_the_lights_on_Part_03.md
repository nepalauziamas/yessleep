So the white pyramid meditation has kinda been working, I haven’t seen anything since I started doing it. And yet I still feel a strong presence at home, like I’m being watched but I try to ignore it as much as possible. 

Last weekend we went to a little house that my parents have in the forest so it's basically off grid. There’s just one big room, a dry bathroom and an outdoor kitchen. My parents always stay in the room and my sisters and I stay in a tent just outside the house. 

The day we got there was quiet, we went to the river and had a picnic. At night my father built a bonfire, we sat around there drinking coffee which for me it’s the only time they let me drink it that late. We were just talking amongst ourselves when one of the twins, Laura, pulled away to look for a cell phone signal because she wanted to text her friend. We didn’t pay much attention to that until she screamed and came back running toward us. 

She said that she saw a tall figure with long limbs running past her, my mother immediately said that it was most certainly a cow but come on, it couldn’t have been, mainly based on what Laura said. I think she was just trying to make us feel safe, but it was too late, I was already terrified. 

We went back to the bonfire and my other sister, Paula, was telling us a story about forest creatures, and that whatever Laura had seen, it was probably one of them. My mother said it was nonsense and went to bed soon after followed by my father. He told us to make sure to put off the bonfire completely before going to sleep. Paula continued with her story about forest creatures and said that normally they are the protectors of the forest and that they were probably just visiting making sure we weren’t doing any damage. She seemed to be really into that because she told us that we should put a peace offering to them. 

“I read somewhere that they like candy and sweets so we should probably leave some for them just to make sure.” She said very sure of herself. 

So we did that, we put a whole package of cookies, some gum and a bar of chocolate. 

They seemed to fall asleep very quickly but I couldn’t, even with the meditation. I just stayed there with my eyes wide open staring at the top of the tent. I don’t know how much time went by. I just drifted off until I heard movement outside. It sounded like something was moving through the bushes, I was terrified but I just made myself think that it was probably a coyote or something like that. After a while I heard movement again but closer and whatever it was, it moved really close to the tent and it was sniffing the tent, (us?). I stayed very still and after a while it went away. 

I fell asleep eventually, no dreams, and in the morning I heard Paula’s voice. 

“I knew it.” She said with a little too much excitement. I went outside to see what was going on. 

“What is it?” I asked her, still feeling very sleepy.

“They came, and I think that what I read online was true.” She said while holding one of the cookies.

“Which is?” I said, very confused, because if the cookie was still there, doesn’t it mean that they didn’t take the offering?

“Okay, I don’t believe it! Look, they are beings from another dimension so they can't actually eat our food, at least not like us, and the reason they like sweets is because of the smell, so they eat the flavour.”

I was still so confused, maybe because I wasn’t fully awake yet but I wasn’t processing the information. She seemed to have noticed that so she put half the cookie in my mouth, and it didn’t taste like anything. 

“See? I ate one before you woke up. They don’t taste like anything.”

“Okay, but you don’t think that maybe they are faulty.” I said not actually believing my words. 

“Seriously? And what about the chocolate? Because it tastes the same, flavourless.”

“I don’t know, I want to believe it but it sounds insane.”

“More insane than whatever visited you the other day, you should try believing this stuff and maybe you can find the answers that you are looking for.” She said while she walked toward the kitchen, where my parents were already cooking. 

Lunch went by very quietly, we didn’t mention the offering to our parents, mainly because mom doesn’t believe in any of it. They were talking about an upcoming wedding and some other stuff, I wasn’t really paying attention. 

On our way back I had Paula’s voice inside my head. I obviously believe in this kind of stuff, because of everything that has happened to me, but… I can’t deny that sometimes I think it is all inside my head. 

And I feel like I can’t keep up, because when I’m focused on finding the answer to something that happened, another thing happens and I’m left feeling like I’m going insane. Maybe I should surrender to the darkness.

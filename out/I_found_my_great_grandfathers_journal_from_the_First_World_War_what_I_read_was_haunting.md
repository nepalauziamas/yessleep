Hello, my name is Trent, and I wanted to share something with you that I found rather,disturbing to say the least. You see my great grandfather had passed away a few days ago and my parents suggested I go to his old home to look for anything I might like since I was a huge history buff added with his military service.

When I arrived at his house I had a wave of nostalgia wash over me, the house itself was nothing special but, the memories I had here were still fresh in my mind. I remembered how much fun I had being able to hang around with my great grandfather, and even today I consider him a great man who did his best to be likable, even with his internal struggles.

Entering the home, I would slowly make my way around the home, mainly just looking at everything and seeing if anything had changed since I had last visited. Surprisingly, nothing really changed, everything was the same way I remembered it. Bringing my attention back to the task at hand I made my way to the master bedroom where I knew my great grandfathers old uniform was and took it.

I continued looking through the closet, looking for any medals or papers my great grandfather might have saved from his time in the military, and while looking on a shelf above the coat hangar, I saw it. It was an attic access point just barely hidden behind some shoe boxes, my curiosity now peaked, I grabbed a step stool, and pushed the hatch open, unfortunately I couldn't fit my head in so I felt around with my hand until I felt it touch something.

Pulling the object down, I see it was an old book with no title or label, opening a random page and glancing over the writing, I realized it was a journal. I debated on whether or not I should take it home to read it first, but I figured reading a bit couldn't hurt so I sat on the nearby bed, and read the entry.

"July 18, 1916, 0200 hours, Yesterday was a complete blood bath, we sent a wave of men over the top and not even one made it back in one piece. I can still hear men screaming in agony throughout the night, part of me believes it's just my imagination but, I'm not the only one who hears them. Joseph keeps complaining about his feet, I told him to go to the first aid station but I haven't heard anything since then, I think tomorrow I'll go check on him."

After reading this entry I found myself both horrified yet captivated, unable to stop myself at this point, I turned the page to read the next entries

"July 23, 1000 hours, Joseph died a few days ago, turns out he had trenchfoot, and a very bad case of it too, his legs were already rotting by the time any form of treatment arrived, I'm gonna miss that kid.

July 24, 0100 hours something strange is happening, me and another soldier, Caleb heard more screaming from no mans land, but it didn't sound normal, It sounded almost animistic but still had a that sort of human tone to it. That wasn't the only thing though, we began hearing shouts and gunfire from the German side along with more of those odd screams or screeches. the gunfire didn't last long but the shouting continued, Caleb understood a bit of German and said he heard something along the lines of "he's missing" or "got taken". I don't know what to make of it, Caleb thinks they might be going insane and turning on each other, perhaps he's right, those screams still gave me the fucking chills though."

"July 24, 2200 hours, Somethings wrong, this morning I awoke to discover a heavy fog had set in all around us, but that's not what worries me, it's the silence. I asked around until I found the previous nights guards, they seemed shaken, almost out of it. I asked them what was wrong but I didn't get much more information other than something big went down on the Germans side, a lot of gunfire and screaming, though one account did stand out to me, a machine gunner stated he saw a figure in the darkness, though it only vaguely resembled a man, I at first didn't think much of his statement, perhaps his mind was playing tricks on him.

That was until I heard that horrid screeching sound from the previous night, this time, just further up the trench line, the sound that before only gave me chills now filled me with a sort of, primal fear, everything in my body screamed at me to get the fuck away from whatever that was. To be honest, I was tempted, that was until I heard the gunfire and yells of fear, almost instantly 5 men, me included rushed to assist. When we arrived we found a single soldier, he was Hysterical, trembling with his rifle pointed towards the small sandbag bunker. He could barely manage to get the words out but when he did, I felt chills run up my spine. "Taken..they got taken!" Looking at the bunker, we realized what he meant, someone or something had ripped a hole through one of the viewing ports and seemingly ripped out the two occupants inside, shown by the blood trail leading outside."

"July 24, 2400 hours, It came back, I awoke to panicked screaming and gunshots right outside my dugout, I grabbed my rifle in a panic and rushed outside, emerging to a sight that will stick with me till the end of time itself, I saw the creature in all its deformed and grotesque glory. Pale white skin pulled so tight I could almost count every bone  in its body, Legs that were long enough to reach a full grown man's chest, connected to an almost hunch back like torso, long arms that reached the creatures knees connected to hands with fingers as long and as sharp as bayonets, stringy black hair that reached halfway down its back.

I froze in terror at the sight of the creature until I heard someone scream my name, It was Caleb, the creature had a hold of his legs and was seemingly trying to drag him to no mans land, Caleb screamed with both fear and agony in his voice to "shoot this goddamned thing!". I leveled my rifle and aimed at the creatures torso, my hands trembled as I fumbled to get my finger in the trigger guard, managing to squeeze a round off just before that creature made its escape, the rifle round hit the creatures shoulder and it let out that horrible, ear splitting screech before releasing Caleb and allowing him to fall back in the trench.

It was then I got a look at its face as it turned its attention to me, sharing almost no features with a human face, its nose was nothing more than two holes in the middle of its face, between two small, purely black eyes to small for the size of its head with a mouth full of animal like sharp teeth with no lips to conceal them. Despite the chaos, I could feel its hatred for me as it stared into my soul for what felt like an eternity, It gave off the feeling that it had somewhat of an intelligence past that of a rabid animal. From what I was told, this took course in roughly 3 seconds before other men had arrived, the creature ran into no mans land before any of them could get a shot on it, Caleb's leg got scratched up pretty bad but he should make a full recovery. I don't know what to think anymore, I feel that we are all being hunted, God help us all."

I sat and stared at the journal entries in mortified awe but also extreme curiosity, questions bounced around in my head like a pinball machine about whether or not there was any official records on this event, and I was about ready to begin researching right there until I looked outside and saw that the sun was setting. I quickly but carefully packed up everything I had found so far and made my way to my car to leave, making sure to set a reminder to come back the next day as I wanted to do a bit more digging in that hidden attic, with that, I started my car, and made the trip back home.

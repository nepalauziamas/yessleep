 Hello, my name is Tom. My family and I have a soup kitchen we run for the homeless population of Saint Louis. It's not very big as we run it out of our food truck but we get a lot of smiles providing the homeless population warm food and blanket, if we have any to spare. We are a wealthy family and live in a large old home with a gate, butlers, chiefs you know, the works. My father owns a business and makes money off that. So we try our best to give back to the community by holding charity drives but our crown jewel is the food truck Named "meals on wheels". My brother, mo,m and dad work on it every other day. Feeding the population who can't feed themselves. It's a really good thing. However there is a dark secret to this that I didn't know about until about a month ago.

This whole mess started when my mother called me into the kitchen crying. I was upset because I was still sleeping and it was 1 AM in the morning. When I get downstairs I pass by my brother's room door was wide open. My brother was a major privacy person so this was out of character for him. "meh it's too early" I thought and kept going on.

When I get to the kitchen my mother and father are both sitting at the table holding each other as if something bad happened. I look at them and say "Hey what're wrong guys? Did I miss something?". Mother looked at me with tears streaming down her face. "your.... your brother he...he was murdered.." She said while chocking up on her words. At that moment I felt a wave of heat rushing through my body and I started to sweat

An enormous amount of weight was pressing down on me as I collapsed to the ground. My ears rang louder and louder. I don't know how to process this and the last thing I remember of that night is seeing my mother rush toward me and everything going black. I awoke to my father calling my name " Tom... Tom! Wake up!" I opened my eyes and asked what happened. "Looks like you feinted champ. How are you feeling?" I blinked twice and replied, "I'm ok just a bit sore."

My father looked at me and said "I love you champ, you've been out all night I gotta ask you something once we get everything here figured out. Today your mother and I are going to the morgue. Will you be able to watch the home for us?" I shook my head yes. "Ah good! We will be back in an hour or so. We won't be long"

They were gone for about 5 hours. Came back and explained the date and time of the funeral for tomorrow. Was surprised how quickly that can come across. A few weeks passed and my mother and father call me to the kitchen again. Walked down the stairs and see my brother's room. Fully lit with flowers on the bed. It's been so surreal like it never happened. I can still hear my brother's voice to this day calling out to me "Hey little buddy!" he would always say even when I grew taller than him. We were always the best of friends.

I get into the kitchen this time and my mother and father looked at me and dad asked "Hey champ. I need to ask you a question why don't you sit down" I sit on the opposite side of them and my dad asked "Since your brother past your mom and I have been struggling to keep the soup kitchen going without your brother we need you. I know it's a lot to ask for but I feel it's a way for all of us to stay together in these times. Plus you've gotten so big and we could use a strong young man to help lift some things we cannot easily."

I looked at my dad smiled and shook my head "Yea, that sounds like a good idea dad! I'll help." Dad looked at me smiled and cheered "Woo hooo we can help people again! You don't understand this is your mom's and I's passion!" He then got out of his chair and started doing what I can only describe as the most dad dance I saw. Mother was smiling and crying a little. She hasn't spoken much since my brother died. But she yelled in excitement today as she got up and started doing even more clich√© mom dances.

Fast-forward a few hours and here I am. In this truck in 90-degree weather cooking grilled cheese and soup and handing out cold water to the homeless outside. My dad and mom were ecstatic as they got to see some of their favorite customers smiling and talking about their day while thanking them for the free hot meal. Our customers started to slow down and I was going to start handing out the last bit of blankets we had. Mom and dad were sitting and talking to an old friend of theirs. As I walked around offering blankets I overheard that a man named Jarod has been missing from the camp for a few days now. "It was as if he just disappeared in the middle of the night," One of the ladies said.

Being the good Samaritan I have been all day I sat next to them and asked "I might be able to help. What does he look like?" "well, a little taller than you but thinner, he was white with long black hair and had a goatee. The last thing I saw him wearing was a Red hot chili peppers band shirt. It was black and red." I smiled and said, "I'll keep an eye out thank you, ma'am!" I was walking toward mom, dad, and their friend. They were talking quietly. I'm not sure why but could just be private adult things. "Heyo momma I got all the blankets passed out and the pots and pans are all washed and ready to go" She looked at me and smiled "Ok son, we'll be heading out once everyone is done eating! Thank you!"

I walked back into the food truck to make sure I didn't miss anything. I was cleaning the console of the fryer when I see something behind it lodged between the wall and it. I reached back and grabbed it with some tongs as my hands were too big to reach down. I yanked and almost fell. It was a black shirt. My heart started racing as I unfolded it. It was a RHCP shirt... Did... Did my parents kill this man? So many things were rushing through my head. I quickly shoved it back as I heard them yelling for me. I moved away from the fryer and yelled "I'm here cleaning up any missed spots momma" My brain was spinning I don't know if I should make a run for it or just act natural.

I decided to stay maybe my parents have a good reason why they have this. Maybe it's my brothers I Just don't know anymore. I hear my mother enter the truck and say "alright let's pick up any trash and we can head home. Good job out there." We clean up and all the ride home I was so nervous. MY parents killed someone I'm not sure when or why but they must have it can be a coincidence all this happen. Did they kill my brother? Did he find out and die? At this point, I was a nervous wreck.

I couldn't take it and yelled, "Did you guys kill a homeless guy named Jarod? I saw his shirt behind the fryer! Did you kill my brother to you monsters?" I instantly covered my mouth hoping this was just a dream. My dad slammed on the breaks and pulled over. "Champ. We will talk when we get home. Don't do anything stupid we can explain what is going on. It's about time you know." He then just keeps driving as nothing happened. I still didn't know what to do I was terrified. Will they kill me now?

We get home after a long car ride. The gates to our home creak open. t never seemed so ominous that we have a 10ft tall gate around the whole property and a door guard until now. I'm sweating bullets as we pull into the driveway. We head into the home and we all walk to my dad's study. I never go in there as it's his private work study. The door is heavy and solid wood a dark red with really old hand-carved signs that look Celtic. This is my first time entering it but I take it all in.

The massive wall of books and the fireplace with ashes still from the winter. The mahogany desk with more of those weird symbols on it. Even the all leather chairs which are super comfy. There's even a couch and a mini fridge. It smells of old books and wood. The doors close and lock behind me. I gulp and hold my breath as my father says "Champ. I know you are worried but this is a good thing. I've been wanting to tell you this we just never had the time to bring you into this world we work in. My job is more than just desk work." My father points to the tv with a remote and starts to display static. After a few seconds, it adjusts to a hidden network. It was a map of Saint Louis with red and blue dots all over moving in and out of frame.

"Today you learn we are hunters. We destroy those who thrive in the dark and are weakened during the day. Evil abominations that look like humans but are truly grotesque and wicked. My job is to befriend the homeless population and find the creatures in the groups that stalk them. We call them wendigo. They are intelligent, stronger than any man, and very hungry all the time. The food we give out has a small chip in each. We hide our true intent to keep the major population safe and secure. We cannot let anyone know what we do except a few individuals who are working on the inside to keep us informed on who might be one and who isn't. Our motto is We work in the dark so you can thrive in the light."

He sighs and says "your brother was going to find one and take it down. He had all his gear ready and it was his first solo hunt but it went south. I almost saved him but the beast got him before I could plunge my blade in its neck." I thought to myself "that's why there was a closed casket..."

"We need another young hunter however we don't want to lose you too. So I'll ask you champ. Will you help save these people with use? Keep the dark corners hidden? It's a burden on certain bloodlines that can succeed. IF you choose to help and fight you cannot back down if you say no we will wipe your memory of this conversation. Keep in mind this isn't easy and you can die." I took a deep breath shaking. In my head, I don't want to its terrifying enough knowing some creature can just eat me and I will just be a memory. so I stood up "Yes. I will take the mantel and fight alongside you and mom." My mother rushed to me and hugged me. "you will do great honey! you are stronger than you think" My dad looked at me with the proudest eyes "Champ! I will call the elders and the induction ritual will start tonight."

"Wait, Ritual?" I asked in a worried tone "Yes boy a ritual. This is an ancient order of very secretive people we have to make sure your body can take the burden. So you must fast until the ritual. We don't want your stomach to burst. It can be messy" He laughs as he walks past me and grabs my shoulder firmly "I'm serious son this will be very painful so meditate and get your mind and body ready. " He unlocks the door and then goes back to his chair. "I have to make a few phone calls I'll come to get you when we are ready. Until then son gets to rest." I'm confused but I'm sure they know what they are talking about so I'll let fate guide me. I then head to my room and start to lay down hoping to sleep.

I woke up in the middle of a forest. It was eerily silent. I can hear nothing but my thoughts. At this point, I am panicking I start running in one direction. It seems to be never-ending. The air is hot and thick and it smells like iron. Breathing is labor intensive I had to slow down to a walk because my lungs felt like they are going to explode. It was then I heard it. My brother's voice felt like it was close by so I start walking toward it. As I got closer it kept getting farther "Come one buddy I need your help!" He kept yelling and it got more and more panicked and labored. I came across a clearing of tall grass. I couldn't see him anywhere and He stopped talking "where are you, bro?" I yelled.

It was then the iron smell became overbearing and I felt something staring at me. It wasn't my brother. This thing stood out of the tall grass eyes blood red. Horns the size of large deer. It must be easily 10 to 12 feet tall staring me down. It was then It rushed me at inhuman speeds. Arms stretched out screaming the whole way through. I couldn't react in the time it took to run and grab me. My arms were snapping like twigs under its immense grip. This thing then opened its immense maw and chomped down on my skull cracking it.

I woke up screaming and covered in sweat. "What the fuck was that" my father entered my room in a hurry "Son!" "I'm ok dad just had a nightmare," I said grasping my chest. It felt so real I can still feel my arms in pain. "what did you see" He asked "Just a large creature in a field it broke my bones and ate my head" He looked at me with fear "Champ it's time. This will help you remember that fear will fuel your will. Remember no matter what happens I love you"

We walk to his study one more time. We sit down as he let 5 other men and 5 women in. I remember them. They are often at the benefit parties my father throws. They all notice me as well and start to say "Oh you have grown! This will be a piece of cake for you just like your brother and father" some say that I look like my father when he was young or how much taller I am than him. My father raises a glass and says "Thank you council members for arriving on such short notice. We have my son who agreed to be a hunter. I'll open the chamber and the ritual will begin so here's a toast to this brave young man willing to put his life on the line for the greater good." They all then raise their glass and drink the shot. My dad then presses a button above the fireplace. that turns the wall of books lowering to the ground. revealing a secret passage to a larger room made of the same wood as the door. With giant versions of the symbols on the door. They all walk in and my dad motions me to the room.

I walk in and was asked to stand at the center as all 10 people surrounded me roughly 5 feet apart and 5 feet from me in a circle formation. They then all pull out a knife and my father brings me a chair and asks me to sit. I sit down terrified wondering "What is going to happen are they going to stab me?" One walks to me and says "Are you, ready sir?" I gulp down my fear and say "yes I'm ready" They then all gather around me knife in hand. They all start to chant in a language I don't understand. Once it stopped the chair suddenly manifests large wooden hands that grab my arms, legs, and head while covering my mouth. I thought am I going to die here? As one of the members start carving these symbols into my arms and legs the pain was intense and I can feel my hot fluids leaking and pouring down my leg and arms. It felt to last forever and I can feel my consciousness leaving my body. I snap back into reality when the arms let me go and I collapse to the floor. No longer in pain but covered in blood.

My dad lifts me and asks "look at your arms son you passed the ritual! This is the first time someone has been able to endure the full ritual in almost a thousand years." I looks down and all the symbols on my arms and legs turned a bright blue and then faded away. I then felt a sudden surge of energy go into my body, mind, and soul. I felt stronger. I can hear my father speaking but it was as if he was in slow motion everyone was cheering but it felt like ages have passed before one can finish even a simple blink. I was shaking to my core as I notice time is getting slower and slower before it stops completely.

It was then something else entered the room. I being I felt no fear. It wasn't scary but more comforting. It looked at me and spoke in my mind "We've been waiting for the perfect host. Today we found one. Tom, I am an ancient being of the light. If you accept me into your soul we will become one body and mind. You will have the controls I will just be the assistant in those. My name is Uriel and together we will cleanse the evil from this plain" I replied in an instant "Yes, I accept you" Uriel floated toward me as all of its knowledge and power flowed through my body and soul.

I then passed out waking up just recently. Tonight is my first hunt I will update you guys shortly. Until then beware of what company you keep.

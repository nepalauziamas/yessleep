I lived in my home for about 7-ish years, and I never noticed this secret lever until a week ago. and I think I'm in danger now!

So, about a week ago I was cleaning my kitchen and washing the dishes like an average person. and as  I was putting away an old, scratched gray cutting board I noticed a lever like the ones you switch to turn on a light. But this lever seemed interesting. When I looked at it I felt like a child told not to do something but instead of listening I became rebellious and did the thing I was told not to do.

But at the same time, I felt like the person telling the child not to do the thing because the thing will have consequences and they won't be pretty.

But, Instead of switching the lever, I went on with my work and finished cleaning shortly after. it was about 6 'o clock when I got done cleaning so,  I made some lunchâ€”nothing hard just a chicken patty sandwich with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, ranch, and ketchup. I was famished and oh lemme tell you that burger was good. one of the better things I can make!

But as I was putting away the dishes when I was finished eating I noticed the lever and it looked different like it wanted me to switch it. at first, I thought I imagined things but, then I saw that it had a red substance around it first I thought maybe it was the foundation or old paint but, the more I looked at it the more I realized it looked like blood!

Then, when I blinked It was gone. Like there was never a lever there like I was imagining the whole thing. *Listen I'm not crazy I'm not losing my mind* I told myself *but wasn't there a lever there?*  I thought maybe not I mean I was famished and sleep-deprived off of the day before, because I had recently lost my grandma but, still something felt off.

and hen night came I don't know what happened but I couldn't sleep again. But then suddenly I got knocked out like I was in a boxing arena against the world's best boxer and it was a 1 hit K.O. I don't know what happened later that night all I know is that I kept waking up and going back to sleep.

It felt strange, the next day. It felt like a dream. it felt like someone tried to torture me but failed. I don't know that Tuesday was the weirdest day I have ever experienced. The night before I went to sleep around my normal time at 12:30 AM but when I was woken up by my neighbor's dog it was noon 12:35 Pm to be exact

I only remember flashes of Tuesday, it felt so weird. The only things that I do remember is me doing chores, and eating for the most part. But, then there's also this one memory that I have which is pretty weird, to be honest. It's me going from my kitchen to my living room and I turn my head very quickly I kinda, like jolt my head to the side, and in the corner of the kitchen next to the old, dirty white tiles I see a figure kinda just sitting there.

But, that's all that I remember of Tuesday. Then, when I woke up on Wednesday, I remember feeling weird like I was Being watched and as I was washing dishes after eating eggs for breakfast I remember seeing the lever again. This time it was all black kinda like the figure it looked like it was ready to just disappear as soon as touched but it wasn't you know?

So, I regret doing the next thing but without thinking I just flicked it. At first, nothing happened but I realized. That the lever wasn't there anymore. But, since Wednesday the appearances have begun.

The first appearance was when I was going to bed on the same day. I was getting ready for bed so I got up to close the light of my room when I noticed my closet door was open I didn't think anything of it at first, but then I noticed that my shoe rack had been knocked over.

After a couple of seconds of just staring at my closet, I noticed that my clothes were moving so I went over to check the closet. as I opened the closet door something felt off and I got scared. I don't know why but for some reason I squinted. and when I opened the door I saw a little bit of the same black substance that the lever and figure were made out of.

Then I went to bed. Thursday came around and I had to go to work. So, I got ready by 8:30 and ate my breakfast by 9 when I got to work it was already 9:23 so I went straight to work and started to work on my project due by next Monday.

The work day past pretty quickly so I was home before I knew it! But, my home looked like it was raided And I got mad quick. I had an exhausting work day before me, and now my whole house is a mess. So, then after a couple of minutes, I just laid there on the couch and fell asleep I slept for about 25 mins but when I woke up I noticed something strange. The house was clean and I don't mean when I left it no I could LITERALLY see my face off the floor.

Something felt off but then I noticed a sign where the lever used to be. It read "If you help us we will help you do whatever you want" at first I stood there confused not knowing what the sign meant before thinking I said, "What do you need help with?" Then, I saw a body appear on the floor I freaked. and I heard "Help Us get rid of him and you'll get whatever you want in reward. We have been watching you and we knew you were fit for the job when you switched the lever,"

OK I thought this can't be that bad

"What do you want me to do with the body?" I asked

"Get rid of it however you can," I heard

*So, now I have to get rid of a god damn body! Seriously?* I thought to myself.  *First, let me put it in a bag and drive out to a deserted area. Or I could Cremate them.* I thought  *Nope! I definitely am not wasting that much money on 'em.*

*I know what to do.* I thought When It became night I drove out to the forest and dug the persona grave and threw them in there and then I hurried home. 

 I wish I could take it back but since then I've become their puppet so please if you see a random-looking lever in your house DO NOT FLICK IT...

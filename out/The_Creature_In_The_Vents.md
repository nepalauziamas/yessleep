When i was 21 years old i saw my friend die at the place where we both worked at.

This all happened when me and my friend we're working as security guards at a local mall.

We only saw once in a while people who we're either drunk or crackheads staring at us or just walking by, as time went on we we're both thinking of changing jobs to a different mall we're security was much better compared to the one where we worked at. We thought about it long and hard but we just couldn't come to the decision of changing the place or staying at the current mall.

Time fly's by and we're still working at the same mall, except on that day the most terrible thing happened that i will never forget.

Me and my friend (who we'll call John) we're sitting in the security room looking at the cameras and drinking coffee and talking about life when suddenly we both hear a loud bang in the mall, we we're both shocked to hear that since it was kind of new for both of us had never seen anyone break in

We both started staring at the cameras trying to see what it was then John notices it and says:

John: Look!

Me: What is it?

as we both stared at what looked to be a went cover laying on the ground we both we're very confused but then John realizes that someone might be trying to break inside from the vents, so we both get up from our chairs and take flashlights and some pepper spray and go outside to the mall.

We we're both running to the place where the vent cover was and when we we're there it was gone like it had never even been there in the first place. Me and John are both surprised that we couldn't even speak, i decided to look up from where the vent cover dropped from and My heart sank

John suddenly asked me:

John: hey are you okay?

Me: look up...

As john looked up his eyes went wide, what we both saw was a 6ft figure with a long neck and a wide grin on it's face and eyes that we're glowing red staring at us from the vent and laughing hysterically it was the most traumatizing thing i had ever seen in my life then suddenly the creature dropped down and started eating John's neck, i remember still being frozen in place as the creature was biting John i suddenly got the courage to pepper spray the creature and bolted out of there, the thing started to scream loudly and i heard it chasing me.

I went back to the security office and locked myself in the room i headed to the cameras to look where the thing was and it was nowhere to be seen i was still in shock and i was crying because of what had just happened, time flew by and i checked my phone to see that it was 6am and i realized that i had to call the police so i did, 15 minutes goes by and they show up, i show them where my friend was and then after i showed them the camera footage.

The police we're also shocked about the creature in the cameras and we're going to put up warning posters about the creature.

As i am writing this i'm 34 years old and quit working as a security guard and i decided to change profession to a mechanic since it was the only other thing i knew a lot about, i still miss my friend John and i always remember to visit him at his grave.

Now, I've known this guy, let's call him Jamie, since I was five years old. Our parents had been friends long before we were born, but they were hesitant to introduce us. Jamie was too much of a terrible influence, being a wild child, for no specific cause. 

I like Jamie.

I must say, Jamie is still as reckless as ever; rock climbing, camping, you name it, he's done it; he was the "life of the party." 

That is, until recently. 

He complained of severe headaches, forgetting his own name, and losing track of time; he repeatedly recalled losing weeks and being unable to recall what happened in between, as if something was eating away at his consciousness. 

I also noted that the days before he'd complain of losing his consciousness, he'd act weird, dead, like an NPC or something. Or as if he was being controlled by someone. 

Jamie, my caring closest friend, who was always there for me, had devolved into a cold, callous, soulless human shell. 

He was the kind of person that was always there for others, donated to the destitute, reunited children with their parents, and so on.

In a crisis, he would never say no. His cheerful demeanour brightened any space, and he constantly had a bright smile plastered on his face. 

He wasn't bothered by anything. 

After a few months, Jamie vanishes, with no one knowing where he went; it was almost as if he vanished off the face of the earth; I hope hes okay. 

I have no idea how this occurred. In my brain, I rewinded over all of our memories, looking for even a speck of something that may have changed him, that could have caused him to act this way. 

To find out what he told me, what he recommended, and what his hobbies were, I jotted down everything he said and recommended. 

Nothing was odd about anything he told me, so I'm not sure why I'm complaining about his behaviour. Something significant could have occurred, causing him to feel this way for reasons beyond his control. 

He's always been such a joyful person; he never speaks over others, he includes everyone, he's always been so outgoing, and everyone adored him. 

Hours passed as I pondered, going through our messages, talks, and his posts, searching everywhere until it occurred to me.

My focus was drawn to something he'd said before, something he'd stated before, something i have never really heard of and something that didn't seem humanly feasible.

He mentioned something about "subliminals," subliminal messages? I recall him sending me a link to a video with an unusual title a while back, i must have scrolled past it and thought nothing of it.

I remember bringing it up before, and whenever I asked what it was, he simply said, "the solution to my problems." 
That was strange, but I never mentioned it because he was my best friend at the time. 
The main part of the title piqued my interest: 'gain anything you desire.' 

How could a simple video so easily give someone something like this? 
I disabled the link because it was no longer of interest to me; there was no way a video could be linked to his disappearance; that was insane. I blacked out; waking up to the bright sun and loud beeping of my alarm clock to my left.

As I slowly opened my eyes and grabbed my phone, I noticed the link had been opened and we were playing overnight, right next to my ear. I simply ignored it, because, hey, I could use some luck, and having something I want couldn't be all that bad. 

I flicked through my emails, scrolling through countless pop ups, ads, anything to entertain or distract me from my friend's mysterious disappearance—until an email flashed across my screen, it was so unexpected, this early on a weekend?? I had no idea what i was in for, what i was about to read.

An email, An email informing me of my friend's death. It was a heart attack. 

First, it was my best friends disappearance and now it was my other friends? 
I hung my head low, clutching it in my despairing hands. How could something like this happen? My greatest friends just disappearing in the blink of an eye.

I decided to stay in that day because it wasn't worth the extra time if I was going to be unhappy, i spent my hours under my blanket, debating. Debating life, debating everything.

After a few weeks, I had finally moved on from my previous friendships, though I was still haunted and hung on by my friend's disappearance, which brought me back to that link. 
That single link. 

I put on my headphones, plugged them into the hole on my phone, and started playing the audio; it was underwhelming; I expected much more than this half-assed audio.

Overtime, I started forgetting about days, i forgot about school, about work, about the video, about everything; all because my headaches were all I could think about;

Jamie, he's pitiful; if I can handle it, he should be able to as well. 

It's all his fault.

That may seem strange to you considering someone simply losing consciousness with no medical issue would be insane, humans have been researching eachother for fucking years and not once has an explainable issue like this ever come across, maybe if I had dementia or something it would be more explainable but im regularly going for checkups, I would know if he had an issue, humans have been stripped of their skin, their organs teared apart and so much more and yet they still exist, humans have been stripped of their skin, Their organs torn apart and so much more, and they still can't explain it?

I hate Jamie. I despise him. 

What makes me so enraged? What drew me in? I'm acting the same way Jamie did before he vanished. Before he walked away from me. He used to choose others. 

I'm sure it was that video, that fucking video, that subliminal? I had to find out, and after googling it, I found multiple explanations ranging from changing yourself through your subconscious to changing how people perceive you around you. I didn't believe it at first, but I should've. 

I should've believed it. 

I finally morphed the faint voices in the background of the overlapped sounds to the point where I could hear them after hours of editing and testing; 

'Submit to me,'
'Brainwashed,'
'Forget about your life,' 
'Your loved ones will die, '
'Everyone despises you,' 
More can be heard. 

What the fuck have they done to Jamie?

What happened to my dearest friend—

I am extremely thankful to have such technology that satisfies all of my desires! What could be better than achieving all of your dreams? 

Every day, we improve our outcomes; why not give it a shot? 

You will not be sorry.

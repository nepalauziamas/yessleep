 

Stuck in a cage outside, with a bunch of random people besides me. We are all scared and confused to be there. That's all I can remember. Everyday we get fed a few pieces of seeds and dirty water, but because of the lack of them people start fighting for them, some hurt, some die and some are lucky enough to keep the little sanity they have. 

Malnourished and by the heat of the sun my skin feels like it's gonna burn off, my stomach feels like it's eating my organs, and my eyes don't feel like closing anymore. Everyone else seems like mindless creatures

Sometimes someone will be taken away, never to be seen again. Some people see that as a good thing, but me and my friend Sam have our suspicions of it and try to avoid being taken by hiding behind others when the man who is our captor comes.

Today a woman gave birth in the cage, and when the man came to take one of us, they immediately went for the baby. The mother tried to protect them, but they eventually got the baby.

Later that day the man came back with “new food” . It was very gooey, and slowly filled the little bowl we all had, and when people tried the goop their eyes lit up and yelled out that it was full of flavor.in a flash everyone was running after the food killing each other in the process for this new food.

Scratching their eyes as blood started filling the cage and others drowning each other with the lack of water we had. When half of the cage was dead we tried drinking what's left of the water mixed with blood and bits of eyes. It did get us satisfied; yet again, nothing did.

One day the man started to take my friend. He tried to resist, but in the end he took him while he was resisting. That left me time to sneak out the door without him noticing as he finally took control of my friend. I followed him and saw him take him into this shed.

I peeked into the shed and saw him tie him to a table. I didn't know what he was doing as I saw the man grab a butcher's knife. I saw my friend plead and cry not to do anything. He slowly started cutting off his head and I heard my friend scream and cry in agony and shaking violently trying to stop the man but he kept going. Blood starts spraying from his neck onto the man.

I covered my ears to not hear his loud cries and screams when they suddenly stopped. I looked back to see my friend decapitated and couldn't see where there wasn't blood, and the man grabbed another knife. Cutting my dead friend's skin off as I heard the skin getting separated from the meat. I heard the man grunting as he struggled to cut the skin off. When he was finally done the man hung him on a hook. My heart feels like it's about to pop out of my chest, wanting to escape. 

Out of nowhere another one grabbed me. I tried to struggle out, but he was too strong and he told the man, hey Gerry caught a run away! The man covered in my friend's blood slowly walked over to me and tied me onto the table. Fearing for my life, I try my best to break free to get out and start getting to cutting. I felt the cold wet blade of the butcher knife slowly cutting through my neck. I tried my best to get him to stop. Absorbing all the pain, my body starts to naturally shake as blood pours down the entire table… Did you know the head keeps being cautious after 5 Seconds of being cut off. In the last 5 seconds I heard one of them say what should we do to the rest of the chickens?

5…4…3…2…1..

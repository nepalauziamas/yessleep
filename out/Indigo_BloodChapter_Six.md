Well, I’ve been able to get through the horde of Weavers and escape them for the time being. And I’m currently processing the fact that I just killed several people (though by that point, you couldn’t really call them “people” anymore). 

After focusing on improving my abilities as I said I would do in my previous upload--and getting some helpful advice from Grandma--I learned to focus the telekinetic energy I used to tear that one guy’s arm off. Oh yeah, that’s another thing: Grandma, for the newly-revealed sweetness she had, recommended that I absolutely, positively not give any mercy to the Weavers, let alone to Alberich. Vengeful feelings aside, I could see why she wouldn’t be inclined to just knock them out; when I ripped the man’s arm off, he didn't seem bothered by it, just mildly annoyed. My guess is that when it comes to being Stitched, physical pain is a non-issue, but psychic pain is intensified. Anyway, if his thralls are able to shrug off major pain and continue fighting with their minds, the only solution would be to kill them. 

So I worked on sharpening that energy, literally. By the time I had finished my improvised “training”, I was able to cleanly slice a target from 7 feet away. That was the point that I knew it was time to leave. I tried to convince Grandma to come with me--don’t ask how she would be able to--but she refused. She told me that since the first time I met her, and by the time she had regained her senses, she had “anchored” herself to the house. She didn't trust herself to be outside. *And besides,* she told me mentally, *you’ve proven that you’re capable of keeping the book and yourself safe.* It was a bittersweet departure; hugs were exchanged, and tears were shed, but she told me how proud she was, as well as how sorry she was that all of this was pushed upon me. With that, I ventured outside, promising to come back when this was all over. 

The Weavers’ azure eyes gleamed in the dark from the trees as they watched me exit. I stood on the last porch step, waiting for a chance to make a break for my car (which was within the “sphere” she had made around the house, and thus unharmed). They leered at me like wolves that happened upon a helpless fawn. Soon enough, my messenger bag flung over my shoulder, I darted for the car. Instantly they began to run in my direction. Five of them came within seven feet of me, prompting me to swipe my hand in a diagonal motion. Instantly they were bisected from hip to shoulder. Using the surprise that the other Weavers must have felt, I sprinted the remaining distance to the car, flinging the bag inside and starting it up. They began to gather behind me, but I wasted no time in reversing and killing at least seven. They were--or rather, Alberich was--confused, which I guess explained why they didn't attempt to attack me in the car. Not at first. 

Suddenly a large tree limb was hurled in my direction, and I was just barely able to use my powers to slow in midair. It still hit the car, putting a dent in the driver’s side door, but I didn't let that concern me. I floored the gas pedal, leaving the driveway and the tires squealing onto the asphalt. I drove well above the speed limit until I made it back into the urban areas. 

I’ve been on the run since, sleeping in the car, only stopping for necessities, and I’ve seen quite a few people with glowing blue eyes that seemed to be searching intently. As a result, I’ve done my best to keep my mind shielded and face hidden. I’m not just running randomly, though. You see, there's another reason besides the book that has them searching for me. I’m using the book to find Alberich. I think it's time he and I spoke face-to-face.

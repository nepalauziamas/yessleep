You know those little memories of your childhood that suddenly just pop up into your head? Maybe it was the time your parents took you to Disneyland and you got to meet Mickey Mouse, or when you and your friends set up a lemonade stand and made enough money to pay for the newest toy that everyone was talking about. Maybe it wasn't a happy memory. Maybe it was the time you fell into the lake at your summer campout, or maybe it was when your parents got divorced. That's what I get. And right now they're all coming back to me. These memories that I've repressed for so long have suddenly come back, and I need some time to think. My name is Benjamin Willis, and this my story.

I was probably 8 years old at the time, and I had a group of best friends. Me, my neighbour Ellie, Gabe, Lachlan, Claire, and Robbie. We were as close as a bunch of second-graders could be, spending every day after school, playing at the park every weekend, sometimes our parents even took us all out to see a movie. 

It all started on Gabe's 8th birthday. He was the last of us to turn eight, so we were all excited that now we'd be the same age. After we played with the pinata and ate cake, our parents told us to go outside. It was late November, so we were bundled up in our winter coats. Everybody except Robbie. He had insisted it wasn't too cold to go outside in this weather, so he marched on without one, the rest of us following behind. 

We played at the playground by his house for a while until our hands started to turn red from the cold metal monkey bars, and decided to go home. Robbie was shivering, and his lips were starting to turn blue. I was just about to say "I told you so" when Ellie interrupted my thoughts.

"Who's that?" She asked, pointing towards a figure in the distance. We all stared at it, slowly getting bigger and bigger, until it was easy to make out.

This was a clown. Not clown as in a goofy looking person, I'm talking full makeup, big shoes, red nose, the works. He honked his nose at us, and it made a squeak. We all laughed. 

"Hello." He said in a sing-song voice. "I'm Mr. Popsy. Pleased to meet you." He held out his hand, and Lachlan reached out to shake it. He pulled it away quickly.

"You buzzed me!" He said, and we laughed at him. 

"Just one of my many tricks." Mr. Popsy said, crossing his eyes. He noticed the only one not having fun, Robbie, who was chattering his teeth. 

"Say, young man, where is your jacket? You'll catch a cold out in this weather!" He said, mock scolding him. 

"I l-left it at h-h-home." Robbie chattered out. 

  
"Hmmmm.... not very smart of you, dontcha think? Now, let me help with that." Mr. Popsy pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket, and to our amusement, it kept on going and going until there was almost a full blanket.

"There, good sir. Now you have a handkerblanket." Popsy joked, handing it to him. 

Robbie let out a weak chuckle. "T-thank you." He said.

"We have to go home now." Gabe said. "It's getting dark." 

Mr. Popsy let out a fake cry. "My new friends, don't leave me." He whined, and we all chuckled. He then got out of our way and let us pass.

"Now you little kiddos get home, lickety split!" He said, making finger guns at us. We all waved goodbye at our new clown friend, and thought that was the end of it. 

Until a few weeks later. Our parents told us we were all having a playdate, but when we got to Lachlan's house, we were confused as to why Robbie wasn't there, or why they were making us sit down at the table to have a chat instead of letting us go to Lachlan's room to play. 

We were even more confused when our parents explained to us that we wouldn't be seeing Robbie at school anymore, or be able to play with him outside.

"But we can still call him on the phone?" Ellie said hopefully, and we all looked up at our parents. They all looked at each other.

"Ellie, honey, no. You won't be seeing your friend Robbie at all anymore. See, last night, Robbie wasn't in his bed when his parents came to wake him up, and they found this note on his pillow." Lachlan's mom told us, and handed Ellie a piece of paper. 

It was him telling us that he was going away, and not to worry, because he was going to have fun and be happy for the rest of his life, and how he was excited because when he grew up he would buy a pet tiger, and if we found him by then, he would let us play with it.

"See, kids, Robbie said in this note. He ran away. I'm sorry." Claire's mom piped in.

But by now the 5 of us were the most confused we had ever been, because of one thing.

That wasn't Robbie's handwriting.

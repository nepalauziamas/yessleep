PART 2-

I spent a few minutes writing down what had happened at the truck stop. I watched a bit of the footage from the camera to make sure I didn’t miss any details. I’m really not sure if I’m just trying to remember every detail, or if I want this written down in case something happens.. It’s still all difficult to process. My entire view of reality is shaken. Writing it down calms me down a bit for some reason. 

Dinar returned to the truck carrying a backpack. 

“I’m ready..” he said in a very serious tone. 

He noticed that I was writing something and asked what it was. 

“It’s.. what happened, I guess. I tried to write out the EON stories and everything that’s happened in between. It’s kind of how I’m dealing with seeing something I don’t understand. It’s messing with my head. I thought I knew what was real and what wasn’t. I thought I knew what was physically possible. I don’t.. I don’t know anything.” 

“Can I see it?” he asked. 

“Sure. You’re welcome to add to it if I missed anything.”

I wrote that/this down, then handed him the tablet.

“Wow! You’re very thorough. You should be a stenographer!” I said. (Ha This is Dinar!) I can’t think of any details that Sonny the cheeseburger hedgehog hasn’t already covered. I will say that we are going to make it out of all this and I will be running my own business very soon as long as the driver stops typing on his tablet while driving..  Dinar out!”

Dinar just handed the tablet back to me. He’s now glaring at me for continuing to type while driving. It was nice to laugh and goof around for a minute. I almost forgot what was happening for a brief second. 

“What’s the game plan?” I asked Dinar.

“I don't know.. I guess we listen.”

“You wanna turn the radio back on?” I asked nervously.

“It’s the only way we’re gonna know what’s coming,” he replied. 

I turned the radio up. It was only static. We decided to leave the static at a low volume so we would hear it if EON came on again. We drove along with no particular destination. We chatted a bit about nonsense that I don’t feel like writing all down. That was until I asked him what he had in his backpack. 

“What’s in the bag?”

“Well, I grabbed my wallet and some snacks if you’re hungry. There is something else,” Dinar said with a goofy looking grin on his face. 

I waited while he struggled with the zipper on his backpack.

“What the hell is that?” I asked. 

“Cat of nine tails,” he said with a smirk. 

“For what!?”

“Whipping… 9 bad guys at once if need be.” 

“Have you used it on anyone before?”

“Not outside the bedroom!” he laughed.

“That’s your weapon of choice?” I asked.

“It’s the weapon I have.” Dinar confidently replied. “I don’t like guns..”

“It uhh.. Isn’t there some middle ground between a gun and a cat o’ nine tails?” I laughed. 

“It’s what I have. It’s awesome! I kind of stumbled upon it and thought it would be a cool souvenir. At least I have a weapon,” he said. 

“I have a weapon, Dinar. I’m not big on guns either, but I’m a trucker. Weird stuff happens on the road.. There’s a pistol in the glove box.” 

Dinar tried to open the glove box as soon as I told him about the gun. 

“It’s locked,” I told him.

“Hopefully you have enough time to unlock it if we are attacked.” 

We rode in relative silence for a while after that. Dinar yelled at me a few times for writing some of this while driving. It would be a few hours before we needed to stop for gas again, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it. 

Eventually, we started hearing noises coming from the CB. It crackled a bit before loud static started blaring through it. I was about to turn it off when I heard a voice. I couldn’t make out what they said at first, but then it started coming in clearly. I asked Dinar to write down what they said. He rolled his eyes.

Dinar here. I didn’t roll my eyes. I looked up. Here’s what the man on the CB said. 

**CB voice:** “Anyone copy? Anyone?? Please..

I reached for the microphone, but Sonnystopped me. 

**(Me) Dinar:** “What are you doing?”

**Sonny:** “Don’t respond.” 

**Dinar:** “Why!? They need help!” 

It seemed selfish and rather cruel to ignore someone who’s in trouble. 

**Sonny:** “I’ve heard that voice before. It’s the same person who asked for help in Oregon. They gave me exact coordinates and when I showed up, they weren't there. There was just a bike and a dead body..”

The voice on the CB started pleading as if they were in danger.

**CB Voice:** “Please! I need help. I wrecked the truck.. I’m bleeding out man!”

Despite what Sonny said, I grabbed the mic and responded. 

**Dinar:** “Hello, I can call you an ambulance. Where are you?” 

**Sonny:** “Don’t talk to him! He’s going to try to trick you!” 

**Dinar:** “What’s the harm in calling an ambulance?” I asked. 

Before Sonny could answer, the voice on the CB came on again. 

**CB Voice:** “I’m just off of exit 20 near Blue Creek. I just need someone to pull me out. I can't move my legs. I can’t stop the bleeding while I’m stuck like this. An ambulance won’t get here in time. If you’re in CB range, you’re closer.” 

**Sonny:** “Isn’t that convenient.” 

The CB came on again.

**CB Voice:** “Hello? Where’d you go? Please don’t mess with me man!” 

I didn’t respond. The man continued to plead for help. He tried to make us feel guilty. I just wrote down what he said. Sonny is right. We should document this. Whether we survive this or not, I want the world to know that this is real. 

The CB went quiet eventually, but only for about a minute. Neither Sonny nor I said a word in that minute. Then we heard the voice again. This time his tone was different. It shifted from asking for assistance to expressing his disappointment in us, or me I guess. 

**CB Voice:** “Ya know, there’s a code amongst truckers.. Ya don’t leave someone hanging. It’s bad karma.. Come on!..

He stopped talking for another minute or so before we heard him yet again.

**CB Voice:** “This is really uncool! I hope you don’t end up in trouble! I expected more from you guys, especially you, Dinar!” 

Despite everything I had seen to that point, my heart still sank when he said my name. I just zoned out staring at the radio. He went silent again. That’s when Sonny noticed something. There were very faint lights in the distance behind us. They started to grow larger. 

**Sonny:** “I’m doing 100 right now. They have to be going at least that fast.”

They started gaining on us quickly. We both jumped when the radio abruptly came back on. Sure enough, it was EON. The DJ was reading some weird poem. The vehicle behind us was getting closer.

**Dinar:** “It’s another semi.”

**Sonny:** “Don’t worry about it. I got it. Just write down what the DJ is saying.” 

**Dinar:** “What!!” Why the hell does that matter right now?!” 

**Sonny:** “He’s been constantly hinting at what’s coming next. It could be really beneficial if we figure out what it is.”

**Dinar:** “It probably involves a truck!” 

**Sonny:** “Please just write it down!”

**EON DJ:** “Welcome back boys and girls! Ya know.. 

There’s a hole at the bottom of the sea..

Through that hole, you can see the valley!

Every new hole is a chance for us to meet

You opened holes yourselves the moment you first heard from me!”

The truck behind us was now tailgating us. I could barely look away long enough to write down that stupid poem. The truck started swerving behind us. Sonny keeps yelling for me to continue writing this down. 

**Dinar:** : Lose them! 

**Sonny:** What a great Idea, Donar! How didn’t I think of that!

The truck pulled up beside us. The windows were heavily tinted so I couldn’t see the driver. Sonny and I yelled as he struggled to lose the truck. Then, it hit us.

The truck was on our left side. They swerved left before swerving back and slamming into us. Sonny tried to slow down. The other truck did the same. He sped up again and the truck followed before gaining on us and hitting us again.

**Sonny:** Shit! They’re trying to run us off the road!

**Dinar:** Lose them! You're a trucker! If you can truck on the ice road, you can lose this wacko!

**Sonny:** The ice road? This isn’t tv, man!

**Dinar:** Well do something or they’re gonna kill us!

This went on for a few minutes. We yelled back and forth constantly while this truck swerved back and forth trying to slam into us. When we’d stop, they’d stop. We would speed up, and they’d catch us. Neither of us wanted to get out and meet whatever was after us.

The truck pulled up beside us again, preparing to slam into us again. Sonny’s truck has been heavily damaged. I watched it swerve to the left. It started swerving back toward us at high speed.

**Dinar:** The exit! Take the exit!

The truck swerved toward us. We were almost to the off ramp. Sonny watched the other truck and at the moment it swerved toward us, he cranked the wheel to the right and barely made it onto the exit. The other truck hit a dividing wall and scraped up against it, shooting sparks and debris everywhere. 

Sonny slammed on the breaks halfway down the ramp, trying to avoid rolling straight into traffic at the end of it. There was no traffic though. We came to a stop at the bottom of the ramp. That’s when I noticed the sign. Exit 20..

I’m not going to tell Sonny that it’s exit 20 just yet. I don’t want him thinking that we should turn around. We were both frozen for a minute, trying to figure out what to do. He drove up to the on ramp, but it was blocked off. There was another semi parked in front of it along with cement dividers.

**Dinar:** We have to go into town. We should avoid the express way anyway. I haven’t seen a vehicle that wasn’t trying to kill us since we left my place.  

**Sonny:** Okay.. Keep an eye out for.. anything. 

We headed into a very small and quiet down. It was silent in the truck as we slowly rolled through town. 5 minutes passed and I saw no signs of another person. There were some buildings and houses, but they all looked empty and rundown. 

**Sonny:** What do we do?

**Dinar:** I don’t know.. I’m sick of writing though, so I’m giving this back.

This is Sonic again. Dinar gave me back the tablet. I’m driving slowly enough to safely write at the same time at the moment. I explained to him why it was important to document this. He agreed, but said he was sick of writing. 

We had no cell service and maps wouldn’t work on my phone. I took the spare key off the ring and handed it to Dinar. I had him open the glove box to get the map out of there. 

“Just find a way to get back on the highway,” I said. 

He started unfolding the gigantic map when we started to hear crackling noises coming from the speakers. I turned the radio up. The odd noises continued before the EON DJ started talking again. 

“Welcome back ya misfits! It’s gettin wild down here in our little disco inferno. We’ll have many more tales of the tormented ahead, but our current web of stories has almost reached its conclusion. Our heroes have faced monsters, mutants, and mad murderous men. As much as I’d love to meet them personally, we have to give them an opportunity to live on.. up there.

Some say the idea of a damsel in distress is outdated. I call that a classic! A good story ends after a hero saves the day! That’s all our heroes have to do.. 

One soul to save.. If our heroes can’t save our damsel from an eternity of nightmares in the EON Valley, then they’ll be forced to join her here! 

The exciting conclusion is dead ahead, only on EON Valley radio!”

We continued rolling slowly down the road. Dinar emerged from the wildly unfolded map. 

“What does that mean?” He asked. 

“I don’t know..”

“I don’t get it,” Dinar yelled. “Where are we supposed to be going?!” 

Moments after he said that, the truck broke down. It basically shut down. All at once, the engine quit, the lights turned off, everything just died. After a few silent moments, the radio turned back on. The song “Psycho” by The Sonics started playing loudly. It’s the band I mentioned to Dina earlier. Could they hear our conversations in the truck? None of it made sense. I tried to turn down the volume, but it didn't work. The song continued blaring. 

“I think we’re here..” 

We had broken down on a quiet road next to the channel of a lake. One side of the road was the forest. The other side was the lake. There were no houses along the part of the lake we were stopped at. There was a boat launch off of a small bank and a long dock. I could see a few other docks down the lake, but the trees obscured most of the view.

“I think we’re gonna have to get out of the truck”, Dinar said. “I’m already sick of this song..”

“Grab the gun out of the glove box” I told him. 

I also grabbed the knife I kept behind my seat. Dinar took out the gun and handed it to me.

“I don’t like guns”, he said. “I’ve got my ninetails!” 

Moments after that, we both heard something. Screaming. 

“It’s coming from across the lake,” Dinar said. 

We looked but couldn’t see anything. I went back into the truck and grabbed my binoculars. “Psycho” was still blaring repeatedly from the speakers. After all the weird stuff I had seen, it barely seemed strange. 

I got out and looked through the binoculars. The screams continued. It was a woman screaming, She’d start screaming, then it would muffle. Then after about a minute, it would happen again. 

I couldn’t see any houses directly across the lake. It was about 60 or 70 feet across. I’m estimating. There was a large hill just behind the shore line. The area around the shore line was thick with bushes and weeds. The hill was too, but it looked like there was a wide trail cleared out all the way up it. 

I scanned the trail all the way to the top. That’s when I saw the mime. 

“Dinar, you’re not gonna like this..”

I started looking away when I heard the screaming again. I looked up and saw the mime cupping its hands around its mouth and howling out. 

“It’s the mime!” I yelled. “The mime is a mam!” 

“The mime is a mam?” Dinar replied. 

I handed him the binoculars and he looked for himself. 

“No,” Dinar said. “There’s someone next to him behind that rock.” 

I looked again. Dinar was right. I could just barely see clothing coming from behind the large rock the mime was standing next to. The screaming started again and the mime cupped its hands again. I could tell this time that it wasn’t the mime screaming. It was just miming the screams of its hostage. A damsel in distress..

“We have to save her,” I said.

“It could be a trap,” Dinar replied. 

“They gave you a choice with the gunman at your store. You did what they asked and the creature basically saved you. Maybe this is our choice. Maybe they’ll have gotten what they wanted out of us. Some sort of twisted entertainment. I think we should help her. Are you with me” 

Dinar paused for a moment, then agreed. 

“There’s a canoe over there,” he said. 

He pointed out a large canoe behind some bushes.

“I noticed it when we were getting out of the truck,” he said. 

We pulled the canoe to the bank. Dinar put his bag in the boat and grabbed the ores while I put some stuff back into the truck, including the tablet. 

I’m going to stop writing for now. I hope that someone will find this if we don’t make it back. I don’t want to take it in the boat and risk losing it at this point. If we don’t make it back, I want to be able to hold out hope that someone will know what happened here. Maybe someone could stop whatever is happening. Maybe they can close the holes between our world and whatever the EON Valley is. 

I just had to stop to reassure Dinar. As I was grabbing stuff from the truck, I saw him drop the canoe and begin to panic. I walked over to him. He kept repeating “I can’t do this. I can’t do this..”

“We’ve got this!” I told him.

“You don’t know that,” he replied. 

“I’m scared too.” I said. “We don’t have many options though.. Whatever EON is, it’s been able to find us wherever we are. Across states.. You did what the story said to when you didn’t give the robber the money, and you survived. That has to be the way out..”

“What if it isn’t? What if it’s just a way to get you to exactly where they want you? Not every story has a happy ending..” 

“This one will,” I said confidently. “Here. take this..”

I handed Dinar the gun from the glove box. I would have liked to have it on me, but I need Dinar’s help. I need him confident. He agreed to continue with the plan. He dragged the canoe to the bank and we loaded it up.

Dinar and I both would like to tell our families that we love them. I wish I had time to write to everyone individually, but we have to get moving. We have to end this. We just.. love all of our loved ones. You know who you are. I’m gonna stop writing now. Hopefully this won’t be the end of the story. Wish us luck….

I’ve made it back to the truck!! It took me a few minutes to calm down and catch my breath.. I just got back in. I’m gonna try to log everything exactly as it happened while it’s fresh in my mind.. not that I’ll ever be able to forget what I just witnessed as long as I live.. 

We got into the canoe and set off for the other side of the lake. It was eerily quiet aside from the recurring screams coming from the hill. We didn’t talk much on the way over. Reality was setting in for both of us. You think you can face anything when it’s hypothetical. This was all too real though.. We’d both seen unexplainable and violent things. Now, we were rowing straight toward the cause of it. 

By the time we reached the shoreline, the screaming had stopped. I looked through the binoculars, but we were too close to the trees to see up the hill from that side. 

We started walking up the trail. It wasn’t long before we heard noises coming from the bushes. We stood still for a moment after we heard it. There was a brief moment of silence before a group of creatures emerged.

It was the same small creatures we had seen before. The spastic little bat like creatures from the truck stop. They sprinted toward us.

We quickly decided to split up. He offered to stay and hold off the murderbats while I went for the mime. We both laughed a bit when he pulled out the cat o’ ninetails. It was an odd choice, but turned out to be the perfect weapon against those spastic things. 

I sprinted up the trail. I didn’t see the mime when I reached the top. I did see the large rock we’d seen through the binoculars. I saw the clothe billowing behind it. It wasn’t a woman, though. It was another rock with a sheet over it. 

I went to remove the sheet when I felt someone grab me from behind. I felt a forearm wrap around my throat. They lunged at me with a knife, using the other hand. I was able to grab their arm before the knife struck me, but I couldn’t breathe. 

I could see the mime’s face in the reflection of the knife. I held as tight as I could as they moved it closer to my eye. I was becoming very lightheaded as the knife inched closer to my eye. I knew I couldn’t fight off the mime. I winced as the knife was about to touch my eye. Then all at once, the mime let go.

I gasped and coughed. I turned myself around to see my savior standing there with a large rock in his hand. He’d actually escaped the murderbats. He saved me.

I caught my breath as we pulled the sheet off the large rock. Underneath was a cassette player plugged into a speaker playing the screams. Next to that was another cassette tape with “EON: episode-1” written on it. I grabbed the tape. We turned around to head back down the hill. As soon as I turned around, I saw the mime standing there with a gun pointed at us.

We both froze. The gun must have fallen out of the bag at some point. I tried to think about my loved ones. I thought about happy memories. I looked over at the stranger whose path had crossed with mine in the most bizarre way imaginable. 

The mime pointed the gun toward me. I turned my head and winced. He pulled the trigger and.. click.. Nothing. The gun wasn’t loaded! Before I could even react, I saw the whips crack against the mime. It jumped backward and lost its footing. It stumbled over a ledge and fell off a large dropoff. 

We walked up to the ledge and looked down. It was a steep ledge. The mime was laying at the bottom, motionless. Those whips really came in handy. We headed down the trail.

When we reached the bottom, we walked over to where the mime had landed. It was still not moving. As we moved closer, we saw the blood. The mime was dead. Looking closer, I realized that its mouth was sewn shut. I looked through its pockets and found nothing but a note. I told him that it looked like a last will and testament, then put it in my pocket. 

We found the gun a few yards away. We grabbed it and headed back to the canoe. I continuously looked back over my shoulder as we pushed the boat into the water. We got in and started rowing across. I felt such a sense of relief as we rowed further from the shoreline. That feeling didn’t last long. 

We got about halfway across when I saw something in the water. Something big. We could see a massive shadow in the water around us. It began moving in circles around the boat. We started rowing even faster and tried to ignore the massive creature beneath us. 

Then it surfaced. We didn’t see its head, but we saw its back. It was scaly and spikey. It looked like a dinosaur. I wondered for a moment if it was an EON creature or if it was some kind of cryptid. Maybe it was a lost species we didn’t think existed because it rarely leaves the depths. 

It continued swimming in circles around the boat, surfacing periodically. We rowed like our lives depended on it. I had a hand on the whips. I didn’t want to piss the creature off, but if it attacked I was gonna whip it. 

We started to realize that no matter how hard we paddled, we weren’t moving. The creature had created a whirlpool the way kids do in swimming pools. The physics didn’t totally make sense, but very little had in the last day or so. 

The whirlpool intensified and we began to spin around with it. We kept trying to row, but it was useless. We panicked and both suggested idiotic plans of escape. Then we noticed the anchor.

Luckily, there was an anchor in the boat. It was a small steel anchor tied to a long rope. We decided that we would have to try and throw it to the dock and latch it on to something like a grappling hook so we could pull ourselves to shore. After a short argument, we decided that he would throw it.

He stood up and held the anchor as we continued to swirl around in circles. I looked to the center of the whirlpool and noticed an opening. It was.. A hole. I could see straight through a hole in the center for a brief moment. Inside was an unexplainable assortment of horrors. Impossible looking beasts and tortured souls. I only saw it for a moment, but I still see it everytime I close my eyes. 

I snapped out of my mini trance as he threw the anchor toward the dock. The anchor landed on the ground past the dock. My heart sank. The anchor dragged along the ground as we began to circle around again. It dragged along the dock about half way before it latched onto a board. He got it!

We stopped circling as the rope got tight. We tied our end around the cleat of the boat. The rope was pulled as tight as it could get. We were stopped as the creature continued to swim around us. We tried to pull the boat in, but we couldn't get any slack. The force of the water was too much for us to pull ourselves in. We would have to climb across.

After another short argument, we decided that I would go first. Despite every attempt to do it any other way, I would have to dangle over the water and climb across. The rope stayed tight as I climbed. 

I had lost sight of the sea serpent until I felt it underneath me. It surfaced right below me when I was about halfway across. I didn’t look down, but I could feel its scales moving against my back for a moment. Despite everything I’d seen, it might have been the most terrified I've ever felt in my life. Well, it’s second to seeing what I saw in the hole.. 

The creature dove down again and I made my way to the dock. The relief I felt when I got my feet onto the dock was intense. It was like I was suffocating while climbing across the rope and was finally able to breathe again. 

By the time I stood up and collected myself, I saw that he was already almost halfway across. I watched the creature's shadow circle as the current got even stronger. I could feel the dock moving slightly. Then the board the anchor was hooked on broke. 

The anchor tore through the wood, but luckily hooked on to another one further down the dock. There was a moment of slack and he fell into the water for a brief second but was pulled back up when the anchor hooked onto the other board. It was still tight, but wasn’t as secure as before. 

He continued climbing. My heart raced as he approached the dock. I could feel the entire dock shaking from the force of the water. We were quickly running out of time.

He reached out his hand. In that moment, I thought about everything that had happened. I thought about the events and the choices that led us here. I thought about the choice I was given.. Then I pulled the knife out of my pocket.. I grabbed it from the glove box when I had the map unfolded.. Have you figured it out yet?

He quickly noticed the knife. He couldn’t quite reach the dock. He started climbing forward, but stopped when I put the knife to the rope. 

He screamed, “What are you doing?! Dinar! Please!”

**Dinar:** I’m sorry..

**Sonny:** But I saved you!

**Dinar:** You shouldn’t have.. The mime was trying to save you.. from me..

**Sonny:** What are you talking about?! Don’t do this!

**Dinar:** I told you I didn’t want to go across.. When I was saying “I can’t do this”, it wasn’t because I was afraid.. It was guilt.. That was the real ultimatum I was given. I fibbed. The real decision was which of us would end up in the EON Valley.. You reassured me.. You gave me the confidence to do this.. You should’ve let the mime kill me.. It has to be one of us..

**Sonny:** But you had a choice!!

**Dinar:** So did you.. I warned you about it being a trap.

**Sonny:** That’s not the same! Please, Dinar! Don’t do this! We can figure out a way to beat it! We can both make it out of this!

**Dinar:** No.. We can’t..

**Sonny:** Dinar..

I watched his eyes turn red and start to well up with tears as I cut the rope. The dock wasn’t going to hold much longer. Now the sight of EON valley that I saw through the hole in the whirlpool isn’t the only thing I see everytime I close my eyes.. I see his face.. His eyes. That look..  

As soon as I cut the rope, Sonny was taken by the current. He was pulled around with the boat and the creature. Within seconds, everything in the water was pulled into the center. The boat, the anchor, the creature, and Sonic the hamburger hedgehog... 

In an instance, the whirlpool stopped. The hole closed, and the water was calm. I walked back to the truck. I just sat there for a while and said goodbye to my innocence. 

After a while of sitting motionless, I read the mime’s note. I had seen enough to get the jist when I found it. He’d been dragged into this too. He was given the same deal I was but he refused it. They broke his ribs and punctured his lungs. That’s why he uses the gas mask. It isn’t for dramatic affect. It’s a makeshift respirator. He needs it periodically to breathe. They also ripped his tongue out and sewed his mouth shut. 

He had his voice taken. He tried to warn me, but I saw him as a villain.. Looking back, he told me everything that was going to happen. He just mimed it, and I didn’t listen. After that, he had no choice but to try to stop me. There’s more to his note and more to his story. I’ll post that eventually. 

That’s part of the deal. I made a deal with the devil. I agreed to spread and share EON’s content. To open more holes.. I agreed to share snuff stories that people will think are fiction. That doesn’t matter though. Once they’ve read, watched, or listened to the story, the hole has already been opened. It can happen to anyone. From a group of strangers, to a colony at Roanoke. 

The deal wasn’t just to distribute their content, though. I’m now the CEO of EON radio. I basically own the station. That’s the dream! That’s what they offered me. When I went to meet those loan sharks, the endgame was to run my own business. EON has allowed me to do just that. 

That’s not why I did what I did, though. They assured me that either me or Sonny would end up in the EON Valley if not both of us. Would you take a bullet for a stranger with a gun to your head? It’s easy to say you would when it’s hypothetical. Looking into hell, then willfully going there to save someone you just met is easier said than done.. I didn’t want to go across the lake.. 

He reassured me when I didn’t want to lead him to his death.. He saved me from the mime. He killed the mime. The mime was just as innocent as he was. This couldn’t have happened without him. 

I keep thinking about what would have happened if Sonny didn't take exit 20. What if I’d listened to the mime? What if I didn’t take the bullets out of the gun. Fate is a funny thing. I prefer to be in control of mine. 

My new associates and I are part of a society working to open more holes and bring the EON Valley to the surface. If ya can't beat em… So keep an eye out for EON content. You might hear it on the radio. Maybe a podcast. Maybe a reddit post.. 

Well, the sun is rising. It’s a truly beautiful morning. The dawn of a new era. I’ll end this by dictating the tape we found on the hill. It’s the voice of our energetic, enigmatic emcee. The DJ and voice of EON Valley Radio,.. I don’t know his name.. I don’t know if he has one.. Anyway, goodbye for now. If you’re reading this, I’ll see you very very soon… 

**EON DJ:** Whoa!! Are you feeling Déjà vu, Vu jádè, Voulez vous couchez? We’ve had a lot of fun with our marionettes, but now it’s time for even more fun with a little twisted meta! If you happen to suffer from trypophobia, look away because more holes are opening with every new reader! Eat your heart out, Yelnats! It’s an eternity of nightmares in the valley and we’ll be comin back atcha with more gore in store! From a prime time mime to an unsuspecting reddit reader. It’s all fear and it’s all here... On EON Valley Radio..

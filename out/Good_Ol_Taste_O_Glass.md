 

I called my mother, girlfriend, siblings, and my uncle.

They all called me fucking crazy.

I live in Minnesota, in a small cabin by the Forest Grove Cemetery where my father is buried.

Father was the only person who I could trust, my mother despises me and wished that she aborted me but only had me because of him.

He was my only friend growing up because I was the weird kid at school, but I ended up being homeschooled because Father was sick and couldn't drive me all the way there.

I only had books and crappy TV to keep me sane, along with his presence.

He told me many stories of local urban legends and such and they were always very interesting.

Wendigos, witches, Hairy Man, Pepie, etc.

I loved that man so much, every day I wish he were here.

Here to believe me, here to be with me, here to protect me, here to tell me everything is gonna be okay.

Unfortunately, Father succumbed to an unknown viral infection, I paid for the funeral myself, the only people who attended were just me and my uncle.

Father always told me after he died to "Take the necklace under the bed at night and hold it close".

Never knew what he meant by that until yesterday.

It was a casual Wednesday, I gathered some logs and kindle, looked for animal tracks for a potential free meal, polished and sharpened Father's old tools, picked some flowers and took them to the cemetery, and eventually returned home.

Flopped on the couch, tired as an old man even though I'm 22.

I sprang my legs over the back cushions of the couch and onto the back of the couch and let my head lean over the couch. Upside down with blood rushing to my head I chuckled a little from the woozy feeling.

I looked at the clock.

# 11:34 PM . . .

I ended up going to lie in my bed.

# KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

I sprang up from bed. Absolutely fucking startled.

I looked through the peephole of my door to see a woman, scared shitless herself.

I opened the door, and she ran in and dropped to the floor before I could mutter a word.

"CLOSE THE DOOR AND LOCK IT," she said abruptly

"Calm the fuck down and explain why you just threw yourself into my house with no invitation to?"

I said as a closed and locked the door

The girl looked shaken to the core as if she had seen the Grim Reaper himself before her

"Something out there was chasing me, it took my friend!" she cried out

I was very skeptical, thinking she was a local meth head or something, but she looked quite sober and hygienic, quite unlike a meth head.

"What's your name?"

I said, in an attempt to calm her down so she can collect her thoughts

"My name is Victoria" she eventually muttered after she calmed down

"Names Ren√©, nice to meet you Victoria," I said before I heard a sudden splat on my window

I slowly turned around as I saw Victoria's face go from calm to panic in seconds.

A severed tongue slid down my window, the blood painted the glass ever so gently and ever so menacingly.

My eyes widened, I was pinching my hand so hard I drew blood to make sure I wasn't dreaming. It was real, it was actually real. Someone's tongue just slid across my window.

The girl started crying horribly loud, my ears rang, I couldn't hear my thoughts, and my vision went blurry.

I awoke to the girl holding me as I was on the floor trying to wake me up.

My ears boomed with banging at my cabin door, the blinds were closed.

I gained consciousness, and the banging stopped seconds later.

I sat up and the girl wrapped her arms around me in fear, she was clearly shaken as she's resorting to embracing a complete stranger.

I got her off me and we both stood up and headed for my room.

There were 20 minutes of complete silence as I and this girl held each other for comfort.

"I think we're finally sa--" she was cut off by a loud window smash and thud on the floor

A loud scream erupted from my living room, I heard the blades of my ceiling fan beat against something and was eventually stopped by another thud to the floor.

Doors smashing open were audible and then eventually another moment of silence came.

Our house had 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms, and 4 doors were smashed.

You could assume which one was next and I had that thought in mind as I waited for death to strike at any moment.

"I'm not taking any chances here waiting to die!" she said loudly.

She ran for the window.

A large, blood-stained arm pierced through the door like it was simply made of paper.

I heard screams that I would never forget in my life.

Something knocked Father's radio and it played Revolution 9 by The Beatles.

Flesh ripping from her body, her bones snapping, heard as clear as day.

Crunching, and chewing.

I couldn't tell what was happening anymore, it all seemed like a horrid fever dream that I wanted to get out of immediately but then again it was all real.

All I heard was the number 9, just the fucking number 9, it wouldn't stop.

A girl I was embracing not long ago at that time, had just fucking been ripped to shreds from what I heard.

I dropped to the floor and cried, I cried for my Father, I cried for my life, I cried for my girlfriend who wouldn't be able to see me again, I cried for my uncle, and I simply just kept on crying.

I had no other option but to just accept my fate.

I opened my eyes.

Under my bed.

The necklace.

The one father told me to hold close, next to it my Father's gun.

A Walther PPQ, my only hope to escape this hell.

I put on the necklace, maybe it was just a placebo effect, but I truly felt that my Father was giving me strength.

I picked up a shoe and threw it by the door, making a loud footstep noise.

The thing poked its head out screaming, I could see it clearly.

It had beaded eyes, a sharp Chesire Cat smile with an intestine hanging from its mouth, and bits and pieces of Victoria all over its face.

The monster brought itself into the room busting the door and wall partially.

This thing looked like an oversized human, but its face was uncanny.

It was about as big as a medium-sized tree.

I was frozen in shock.

The monster taunted me in tongues and had this near-demonic laugh.

The pendant gently hit my chest as I shook in fear, a clear reminder of what I had to do.

I fired off an entire magazine of .45 ACP, every shot more deafening than the other.

The monster screamed and fell back holding its face in pain.

I jumped the window, according to the doctor I had shards of glass ranging from 3-5 inches in my body as I ran from my house.

Screaming was heard behind me, it sounded even more monstrous and angered than before.

Every step I took as I ran scared the shit out of me because I thought the thing was chasing me.

It was.

The trees rustled.

Louder, and louder.

I had arrived at a town, all the lights were off.

I screamed at the top of my lungs as I ran across the town.

Lights began to turn on.

Townspeople came out with rifles and pistols in hand, thinking it was a threat or some crazy lunatic probably.

I was free, I was finally fucking free.

I had stopped at a house with a man holding a rifle, just thanking him.

thump

From what I was told, I passed out from exhaustion and blood loss

I was in so much pain, I repeatedly pressed the button for morphine.

\---------------------------------

**2 Days Later**

\-----------------------------

I was finally well enough to leave the hospital.

I waited a few hours and got discharged.

Stepping out of the hospital, I took a long breath of air.

Finally called my mother and had a 20 minute conversation filled with gas lighting.

She tried to convince me I was crazy, even though police were investigating the scene.

Funny enough, no trace of Victoria, just the house destroyed.

I called my girlfriend.

My uncle.

My girlfriend.

My siblings.

They all call me crazy.

I know what I saw.

I glanced at the forest, and began to walk towards the gas station to get a snack to clear my head.

**SQUELCH**

I stepped on something. I removed my foot from where I stepped and there it was.

The severed tongue that slid across my window and started it all.

 Hey. I’ve lurked on here for awhile and I feel like you guys have seen it all. Have you ever experienced anything like this? I feel like I’m losing my mind here, I barely sleep and have the weirdest nightmares if I do fall asleep. I’m sorry if this is sort of stream of consciousness, I’m not even sure where to start. I haven’t slept in days, ever since my friend sent me these weird texts.

So, okay I guess I’ll start at the beginning with the texts, and I hope this all makes sense… 

My best friend Angie (who moved across the country three years ago) missed our weekly zoom call two weeks in a row. She wouldn’t answer her phone, she and I typically text at least a couple times a week so I got really worried about her. I’m the introvert and she’s the extrovert so usually she’s the one trying to get *me* to respond. Eventually I called her husband, Brad. No answer. I eventually called the police for a wellness check since her family is gone and I don’t know Brad’s. The police officer told me they were both just…gone. Like, no sign of a struggle, food on the table, gone. 

Then, about a week ago, I get a text from her. Here’s my last conversation with her – I also want to add that this is not her usual ‘tone’ either:

*‘hey u’*

“Hey! Oh my god, are you okay? I was so worried about you… I did a wellness check and you guys were gone”

*‘were on vacation soooooooooooooooooo great’*

“Oh, shit I’m sorry. Hope I didn’t cause a massive headache with the wellness check, I must have forgotten you were going to be out of town, I got really worried… you know how I get...”

*‘lol’*

*‘somuch fun u should come next time’*

“Where did you go?”

And she sent me a maps link, surprisingly this place was only 30 minutes away from me. I’ve been in that area so I have no clue how this old-ass looking hotel popped up out of nowhere, but mainly I was a little hurt that she had been so close by and didn’t let me know. I spent a while trying to make sure that didn’t come through my tone in the text, so I was typing, deleting, retyping – I already felt bad enough for calling the cops out to her house while she was on vacation…

*‘hellohellohellohellohello are u coming yet’*

“Oh sorry I was checking it out, it looks nice, didn’t realize you were in town!” 

*‘don’t worry They will come 2u’*

*'are u coming'*

I haven’t heard from her since then. She won’t reply back or answer my calls. 

So, when I looked at this place on my maps app it had tens of thousands of five-star reviews. I’m not sure how to attach an image here so I’m going to copy/paste some here, these aren’t even the weirdest ones! Just the most recent. I don’t want to tell you the name of the place because, and I know this sounds crazy, ever since I looked at this place on the map I can’t sleep, and I think my maps app might be possessed.

*“It may not look like much from the outside, but the inside has been remodeled and it has country chic vibes and shiplap for days. Everything is so new and you cannot beat this price, especially so close to the provincial park! Are you coming yet? Come and see Them!”*

Shayla G.

*“Wow what a great retreat for busy moms! I was so stressed out and their spa really took care of me. The facilities are so modern looking, and they offer all the usual treatments but at a price I could actually afford. You guys, I could literally feel the skin melt off my body, my rings melded with my flesh! Talk about exfoliation! Can’t wait to go back. Next time I’m bringing the kiddos, they give you discounts if you bring your kids! Bring your friend’s kids! Bring your neighbors’ kids! Bring your tender ones here!”*

*“My wife and I really needed this vacation. Work has been crazy for us both and we were so excited to find this place for so cheap and so close to home. The room was huge, clean, the staff were nice, and the room service food is actually incredible. They even have free entertainment for guests, my wife and I could simply watch the shapes move behind the wallpaper for hours! When They finally arrived, our eyes bled in sheer wonder! 5 stars”*

Eddie S.

*“Such a great place to bring your children! You will never feel closer to them as when you are up to your wrists in the warm pulp tearing, tearing, tearing! And get this, Taco Tuesdays! Taco Tuesdays! Every Tuesday! Taco Tuesdays for the children! Taco Tuesdays from the children! Bring your tender ones here!”*

*“Our bodies went home but we’re still here. We’re still here. We are all still here. But we watched them leave? Lololololololol”*

*“This place is gorgeous! I cannot believe how close by this place was to Raton and that I had never seen it before. The art deco style took my breath away, literally! If you’re into Art Deco, take the spiral staircase leading to the ballroom and check out the mezzanine and the marble around the elevators. Don't even get me started on the stained glass in the lobby. The staff is super knowledgeable and will gladly walk you around and give you a tour!*

*You can tell there is a lot of history here; I could feel the heaviness in my room in fact I was basically drowning in it! If you move your eyes fast enough, you can even see Them out of the corner of your eyes. I definitely want to come back here with my niece. I used to be so lonely since my kids went off to college but I’m never alone anymore. What a wonderful place, and at an unbelievable price.”*

That’s weird right? And that’s just a selection. And these reviews definitely don’t sound like this place is 30 minutes away from me in the Texas panhandle. Have you ever heard of this place or anything like this? Is this some sort of super creepy targeted marketing, now that I looked at it on the map?

I need your advice because now this place just shows up on my GPS, no matter the destination I actually type in, it eventually switches and tries taking me here. I cleared cache on the app, I tried a different app, and still, no matter what I do, any GPS tries to take me to this place. I’m really bad with directions and this has made trying to navigate such a nightmare.

Those creepy reviews make me not want to go but I feel drawn there. Should I go? Maybe I can finally get some sleep if I do, I keep having so many nightmares these days. I should go, right?

Update: okay, since someone asked, I think I found a way to attach some images, does this work? [image](https://www.reddit.com/user/JamFranz/comments/ur2ic1/picture/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

Update: please don't open map links I may post or send to you

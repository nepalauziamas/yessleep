They sound just like crying babies.

For the first few nights, I was absolutely sure that there was a child somewhere in this house. I would wake up at dawn ripped out of my dreams from their sharp cries. It freaked me the hell out until I learned that seagulls can sound just like human babies.

I wouldn't be surprised if someone told me that they do this on purpose to gain our trust. 

I don't think there's anyone that hates those birds as much as I do. And it really doesn't help that the steps they take on the roof make it sound like there is a full-grown adult climbing around, trying to find a way in.

But it's only the wood that makes them sound that heavy. At least that's what I thought at first. Now I know there is much more to the story, a danger I couldn't have been prepared for. 

I wouldn't be surprised if the birds here stab their beak into your chest and take your heart instead. Although this might be more due to the town than the birds. To be honest most things here differ slightly, if not completely, from normal. A perfect illusion of a beach town.

I don't think I was ever supposed to come here. So why am I?

A few months ago my grandmother passed away. We were never close to her, the last time I saw her I was 10. I'm 25 now and hardly remember her face. So I never expected that she'd leave anything to me, let alone a house just next to the beach in a small town I'd never heard of before.

But it couldn't have come at a better time—the house, of course, not her death.

It was summer, I had no plans and neither did my college friends Jasmin and Finn.

And for the first few days, things were close to perfect. I didn't sleep well at night because of the seagulls but I had all day at the beach to make up for that. We'd watch the waves while having breakfast in the backyard, that's how close we were to the ocean. After breakfast, we'd put our blankets in the sun and tan all day.

Having no schedule, no responsibilities, no goals. It was a great distraction from work stress. All we had planned for the first week was to visit the pier which apparently had a Ferris wheel and a bunch of carnival booths.  

We went there on our third night in town but I don't remember much about it. All I know is that it was the night things started going downhill. 

When the first one of us was marked. 

\--

"You can see everything from here! This is awesome!" Jasmin screamed from the seat underneath ours on the Ferris wheel. It only took half an hour for her to meet some guy who she convinced to go on the Ferris wheel with her, leaving me and Finn alone.

I looked down at the couple and saw the guy's face buried into Jasmine's neck while she wouldn't stop giggling. 

"She doesn't waste any time," I joked.

Finn grinned but didn't look at me or back at those two.

"You can literally only see water and some lights," he said but still seemed mesmerized by the ocean underneath us. I couldn't blame him, the reflection of the moon and the way it seemed as if the dark water went on forever, it was pretty hypnotizing. 

The ride was over before we even knew it before either of us could even blink. Or maybe we just forgot because we had to watch the ocean so closely. 

Behind us, Jasmin and the random guy she'd picked up came to a halt. 

I didn't mind that she met someone no matter where we went, usually in the first few minutes. She was insanely charismatic and only had to look at a guy for 3 seconds with her big hazel eyes and he was hers. Until she got bored.

This time it was different though. She was glued to him, not the other way round and this guy was nothing like her usual type. 

He seemed fragile, very pale, his dark hair made his eyes almost disappear.. and he looked older. Jasmin's usual type was tall, tan, and blonde. But who was I to judge? It's not like she planned to stay with him forever.

That's where my memories of the night end.

I don't know what happened those next few hours, only that I was woken by the sound of cries again but this time they didn't come from the roof. They came from downstairs.

Slowly I walked through the hallway, the closer I got the better I could hear. The sounds were coming from Jasmin, outside on the porch. The front door was wide open.

Did she have a fight with the guy of the night? 

I walked through the door and saw her sitting there on the stairs, face buried in her hands. 

"Jas? You alright?" 

When she turned her head and moved her hands away from her face, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.  

She was sitting there in the same yellow sundress she wore last night but now it looked as if the dress was wearing her. I don't know how else to describe it but there was nothing left of the Jasmin I knew.

Her skin was stuck to her skull but it appeared as if everything that was in-between was gone. Like she'd been drained, all her blood taken. And her body was entirely plastered with tiny little holes.

She opened her mouth but was too shaky to say anything. Finally, words escaped.

"Kill me."

\--

I shouted for Finn and we immediately called an ambulance as well as the police. 

The police never showed up but an ambulance came and took her. They told us we couldn't come along with them for whatever bullshit reason. We started screaming, completely panicked but all they said was that things will be fine and well and not to worry.

They said they see cases like these all the time and it never means anything.

"Allergies, maybe. City people aren't used to our ocean water," one of them said while the others carried Jasmin into the ambulance. Can you believe this guy's nerve?

Jasmin looked like she should be dead. There was absolutely nothing left inside of her. 

"How do you know we're from the city?" Finn asked him.  

The paramedic only smiled.

"If you want we can come inside and explain?" He asked.

"What?" Finn said with a raised voice. "Take her to the damn hospital now!"

"Yes. We will take her to the hospital now. We will see if she stays or not," another one of the paramedics said in a monotonous tone.

"What's that supposed to mean? Where is that hospital?" I asked. 

He came a little closer, too close for my taste, and whispered, "You look like you could use some sleep. Are the seagulls keeping you up?"

\--

There was no hospital in the whole town. 

And we didn't look outside of it. We didn't call her parents. We didn't call anyone outside of this town.

I wish I could tell you why, logically I knew we needed to run away, get help, do anything but something was keeping us from taking action. 

We simply continued our days just like the ones before. Jasmin was almost forgotten or at least not consciously thought about. Because our consciousness wouldn't let us. 

But of course, things didn't stop there. The second one to get marked was Finn.

\-

Maybe it already happened on the first night on the Ferris wheel. Thinking about it now, I'm pretty sure it did because ever since then he was obsessed with the ocean.

Day or night, it didn't matter, he always found a reason to go for a swim. And every time he came back, he was slightly different. When Jasmin was taken away in the ambulance it took him less than ten minutes to switch into bathing shorts and jump into the water. 

When he returned in the evening his skin was so burned it had already started peeling. He was all shaky because he hadn't eaten anything for 8 hours but despite everything, he didn't seem to mind. He just kept humming some melody and only stopped to down three big bottles of water. 

We hardly talked. There was a lot to discuss but the words wouldn't come out of my mouth. All I could think about were the cries on the roof.

\--

At night, Finn was gone again. This continued for three days. Day and night he went swimming, only coming to the house for short breaks in between.

When he didn't come back one evening, I went to look for him at the beach and after an hour I found him on top of a small canyon not too far from the house.  

He was simply sitting there at the top, staring at the water while he kept repeating something.

"I hear her. Do you hear her? She sings. She sings for me. I hear her. Do you hear her?"

He was a shell of his old self.

"Finn, I think you're sunstruck. We should go home."

"Certainly looks like the sun was at play!" I heard a familiar voice call from behind us.

I slowly turned around and my eyes met the ones of the same paramedics that took Jasmin.

The ambulance was not far, how did I not see or hear it before?

"What-what are you doing here?" I muttered. "Finn, did you call an ambulance?" I asked, already knowing that this couldn't have been the case. He had no phone with him but there was no other person around either, how did they think of coming here?

"We will take him to the hospital now. We will see if he stays or not."

\--

There was nothing I could do. Physically, mentally, I don't know. I felt as if I was going through a fever dream.

My friends were gone and I stopped leaving the house. I spend every day inside. Just me and my thoughts as well as the seagulls outside.

Three nights after the ambulance took Finn, I lay in my bed.

It couldn't have been later than 3 am when I heard them again. Their cries, they sounded so human. Like a tiny child crying for its mother. And finally, I noticed something. For as long as we'd been here I heard the seagulls every single fucking day but not one time had I actually seen one outside. I jumped out of bed and opened the bay window at the end of the room to have a look.

But there was no seagull on the roof. 

There was not a baby either.

But when I looked to the left, my eyes met the ones of something that made my entire body tense up. 

It was right next to the window, just out of sight but close enough to hear its cries. 

And it was wearing my grandmother's face. 

The face I remembered from ten years ago, slightly blurry as if it was recreating my memory. The body, however, was the one of a man's. When our eyes met it stopped making the seagull sound.

"Honey, I'm so glad you've come to visit. I've missed you. Can you help me inside?" It said with a distorted voice. 

I jumped back, falling to the ground behind me. My breathing got so heavy that I was sure I would pass out and the thing would devour me but strangely it didn't move either. It just kept watching me and as it did, its face started changing. 

My grandmother was gone and instead, I looked at the paramedic.

"W-what do you want from me?" I finally asked.

"I just want you to invite me inside."

\--

It took me a few days inside to get used to everything. It stopped masking itself as seagulls. It tries different things now. Sometimes it looks like Finn or like Jasmin. 

After I learned that it can't come inside without my approval, I started going outside again sometimes. I've even talked to some locals, most of them don't want any contact but seldom some do open up.   

There's a battle between different forces going on here. The one that took Jas needed blood. The one that serenaded Finn wanted his mind and attention. The ambulance I think just comes and takes the scraps. I don't know what they do with them.

I can't leave. I can't call for help, can't say where I am. My parents haven't tried to contact me, I don't know why. 

I think I'm starting to understand why we didn't see my grandmother for so long. I just don't understand why she gave me this house.

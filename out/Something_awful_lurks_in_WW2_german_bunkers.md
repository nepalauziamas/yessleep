Me and my friend have always had a passion for old and abandoned places when we found an abandoned WW2 german bunker in our country we were so stoked to go but looking back at it i wish to god we wouldnt of have even found the damn place.


Anyway, we get into my car and start roadtriping our way over there, it was a really long 9 hour drive and while we were on tje road i couldnt help but think one thing "why havent more people discoverd this place?" i mean after all i found its coordinates on google "30.8216068, 28.9500247" but it was on a really sketchy website that i had to scroll for a while to find, i get tired of thinking and pull over to let my friend take the wheel and i get into the passenger seat and let my eyes close.


I wake up, the cars parked and my friend's dead asleep in the driver seat and i look to the GPS it reads "9:07 AM, you have arrived to your destination" i wake up my friend and we get out of the car and we notice that the coordinates just lead us to a tree out of frustration my friend stomps on the ground as hes stomping we hear a metally *DING*, We keep looking around the area where we heared the sound and sure enough right next to the area is a handle sticking out of the ground.


We pull it up and we get a whiff of air that i can only describe as really old rusty metal, theres a stairwell that looks too well maintaned for how old the place is, we dont think much of it because of the sheer excitment so we go down the spirally stairwell and we reach the bottom of the stairwell, a sign to our right read "erste stock" which translates to "first floor" in german.


We take a couple of steps and look to our left, a door and to thr right of it a sign reading "Versuchsperson eins"  but our cell reception went out so we couldnt translate it so we tried opening the door but it wouldnt budge, so we tried kicking it down but to no prevail. We decided we would leave it and move onto the next door this time there was no door, instead it was just another hallway so we walked down it, but while we were walking down it something just didnt seem right to me, it was something rythmic so i asked my friend to walk and on the count of 3 stop 1...2....3 we stop moving i hear another footstep echo but...it wasnt ours.


Instantly my heart sinks into my stomach and i start booking it to the entrance we came from and as i was sprinting back i noticed something in the corner of my eye and when i take a good look at it i froze, the door was wide open and behind it was a tall thing that had many human heads and hands and legs and limbs on it. but whem i heard it squeal and start moving the adrenaline kicked right back in me and i start running and i go up the stairwell like usain bolt and i make it to the top and i look back down and the thing had my friend i saw his eyes for a fraction of a second before his body was dragged back into the bunker by whatever that thing was and i heard him cry out the most blood curdling scream ive ever hear in my entire life but it was cut short and then i heard gurgling i accepted the fact and ran back to the car and got in the car and  turned it on and put the pedal to the metal.

fastforward a couple of weeks later: i turn on the news and the headline is "16 teens found dead in multiple German WW2 bunkers all over the world!" i knew instantly. that thing wasnt just in this german bunker. theres one of them in every german bunker.


I still to this day dont want to search up the meaning of the word on that sign but i know damn well thats for the better good of my sanity.

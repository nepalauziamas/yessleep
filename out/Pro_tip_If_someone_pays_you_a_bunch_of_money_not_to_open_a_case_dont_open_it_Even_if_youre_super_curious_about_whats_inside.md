Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back.

If you haven't heard of the second part of that phrase, you're not alone. I didn't know about it until yesterday. And there's a reason for that. Many people have died because they were too curious, and as far as I know, none of them were brought back to life by their satisfaction.

Which means that I'm completely screwed, because I let my curiosity get the best of me when I *definitely* shouldn't have, because I'm terrible at making good decisions.

Like that time I drank a cup of paint because my friend Jack offered me a dollar for it. Or like six days ago, [when I accepted a sketchy job offer](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/waufok/pro_tip_dont_follow_strange_girls_into_the_forest/) from a girl I'd only known for a couple of hours. Long story short, I pick up a cello case and drop it off at this one house, and then I get paid two hundred dollars. I'm also not allowed to know what's in the case, or look inside.

So yeah. Super weird. But I'm also getting two hundred dollars *per delivery*. All I have to do is walk a few blocks, put a case on someone's doorstep, and try to ignore the fact that I have no clue what's inside it, and it sometimes leaks weird black slime.

My parents don't know what my actual job is. They think I work at the local craft store, and they never go to craft stores, so hopefully they don't find out I lied, because that's going to be a really awkward conversation.

"Yeah I actually deliver what might be drugs, and I followed a random girl into Hinstone Forest, the place you guys specifically told me not to go to! Whoops!"

My parents were so proud of when I told them I got a job, which is very rare, and I don't want to ruin that. And as long as they don't see through my lie, everything will be fine. Or maybe it won't, because I screwed up massively.

It all started when Heather came back to my house.

"So, you in or not?"

"If I say yes, will you tell me what's inside the case?"

"Nope. Do you still wanna do it, or was that a deal breaker for you?"

"...I'll do it."

"Great! Here's my phone number, I'll text you when ya have to make your next delivery! Just gimme yours, and we'll be all set!"

She handed me two slips of paper and a pen. One had a phone number written on it, and the other was blank.

"My phone's charging right now. Just write your number down and I'll put it in my phone as soon as possible."

I wrote my number down, and gave it back to her.

"Thanks! Catch ya later!"

As I watched her leave, two thoughts came into my mind. The first one was: *Wow. I might have actually just joined the mafia or something. I'm completely screwed.*

But that was quickly overshadowed by the second thought: *Holy crap, a girl just gave me her number.*

I mean, she gave it to me for work reasons, but it still counts, right?

The rest of the day was pretty good. My parents were proud of me for once, I finally finished unpacking, my room was fully decorated, and one of our neighbors brought us cookies as a "welcome to the neighborhood" gift.

(Note to self: Stay on Mrs. Garcia's good side. Those cookies were the best I've ever tasted.)

I started to relax a bit. Surely I wouldn't have to deliver that case very often, right? That's why Heather's paying me so much for it. The people here seem pretty friendly too, (well, except for those creepy people in the forest) so maybe I'll make friends more easily than before. Living in a small town might have its benefits after all.

I was less relaxed the next day, when I woke up to a text from Heather.

*Just got the case. I set it on the outskirts of the forest, right by the sign. Please deliver it before 9 PM. Thx!*

She'd asked me to deliver it again after *one day.*

I sighed, and put on my shoes. It was 7:30 and my parents were still asleep, so I figured now would probably be a good time to sneak out without them noticing. Hinstone Forest was only a ten minute walk away from my house if I walked quickly, and the house I needed to take the case to was only a couple blocks away from mine. The trip was quick, and relatively uneventful. I tried to shake the case so I could take some of that black stuff that leaked out before, but the case didn't leak, so I gave up.

If I wanted to investigate, I'd need to try something else. So after I got back home, I turned on my computer, planning to do some research on Hinstone Forest.

Unfortunately, my mom interrupted me.

"Virgil! You need to get off your computer. You've been spending way too much time on your devices."

"But-"

"No buts. Read a book or go outside!"

So I went to the library instead. On my way there, I saw a boy sitting at what looked like a lemonade stand. I'd never seen a lemonade stand in real life before, and I was intrigued.

"Hi! I'm Trevor! You're the guy who moved into that house that's been empty a really long time, right?"

"That's me. You selling lemonade?"

"I'm all out of lemonade today, but I've still got my magic eight ball! Do you want me to predict your future? I'm psychic!"

"*Really?* You can predict the future? How?"

Normally, I'd think this kid was lying, but a fuckton of weird stuff has happened here, so who knows?

"I got this magic eight ball for my birthday. It's actually magic!"

"It's actually predicted the future?"

"Yup! Not always, but it's right most of the time!"

"...How much is most of the time?"

The kid smiled proudly.

"Thirty to forty percent. I had my big brother do the math for me, he's super smart!"

This kid was just guessing. Still, I admired his hustle, so I decided to buy a "reading" from him.

"Alright, what's your question?"

"Will I make friends here?"

He shook the magic eight ball.

"Let's see...It says "my reply is yes." Lucky you!"

I paid him, and was just about to leave when he said something else.

"You're new here, right? Did anyone tell you that the woods are haunted? My big brother saw a ghost in there once! He almost died!"

"What did your brother say the ghost looked like?"

"He didn't tell me 'cause he said it would give me nightmares. It must've been REALLY scary, because I'm super brave, and I didn't cover my eyes during the scary parts of Snow White."

"I'll bet it was. What's your brother's name?"

"Travis. People mix us up sometimes, it's really annoying."

I made a mental note to talk to Travis later as I walked to the library. When I got there, I found out that there were no computers there.

"The libraries at the schools have computers, but they're closed right now. Sorry hon. What do you need help with? I might be able to find a book for you, and I could get you a library card while you're here! Your name is Virgil, right? It would only take a few minutes. Oh! I forgot to introduce myself, silly me, where are my manners? I'm Miss Cherry, I run this library, if you couldn't tell."

The librarian talked so fast, I barely registered what she said.

"Um, how do you know my name?"

"Word travels fast in a small town! New people rarely ever move in, and when they do it's almost always because they married someone that lives here. Families barely ever move here, so that's pretty much all everyone's talking about right now!"

"Oh. Well, I was looking for information on the forest here. Everyone's saying it's like, haunted or something."

"You're talking about Hinstone? I can tell you all about it! Heck, just ask anyone here, we've all got stories! Is there anything in particular you're interested in?"

"Can you tell me about those...zombie guys?"

"Those nutjobs? Avoid them. They call themselves the Council Of Eternity. Nobody really knows how their little group started, but they're constantly trying to recruit new people to join their cause. Not just from here, they go to other towns close by, and they've used the internet to get people who live out of state to join too. Usually, they don't leave the woods, but you'll sometimes see them going into town. If you ever see them talking to the kids, tell an adult right away. People are worried about kidnappings."

"If they're so worried, why don't the cops do anything?!"

"They can't. There's this weird loophole when it comes to the laws here. Hinstone Forest technically isn't a part of Hawthorne, even though it's in Hawthorne. Nobody owns that land, but people have declared it their micronation. Basically they're saying they can make their own laws, as long as they're not actually in Hawthorne, or any of the towns surrounding it."

"And that works?"

"Apparently so, because every time the sheriff manages to arrest one of them, they're released a few days later on a technicality. Some people suspect that there isn't a loophole. They think the group's just paying the sheriff off, which could be true, but if it is, I don't know where they're getting the money to do it. None of them have jobs or anything."

"I also heard about a cello case that appears in the forest. Do you know anything about that?"

She looked confused.

"I've never heard of something like that, and I know a lot about those woods. Are you sure you aren't mixing things up?"

"Maybe I am."

I was going to ask Miss Cherry more questions, but I got a text from my dad telling me to come home for lunch, so I had to leave.

Right after I finished lunch, the doorbell rang, and when I answered it, Heather was standing on the porch, holding up two hundred-dollar bills.

"Thanks for the super-early delivery! I gotta say, I didn't expect ya to do it as soon as I sent the text. I admire your work ethic. So here! You've earned a tip."

She handed me four Pokemon cards.

"Do you collect these? Keep 'em if you do, but if you don't, give them to Kyle. He works at the thrift store, and he'll pay you a lot more for them than they're worth."

She tossed her hair over her shoulder.

"Anyways, I've gotta go. See ya later!"

Then she ran off before I could even get a word in.

I fell into a sort of routine after that day. Heather would text me every morning, I'd deliver the case, then I'd either spend all day hanging out at home, or I'd go around trying to find answers to my questions.

Surprisingly, most of the people I met had the answers I was looking for. Most of them weren't nearly as cryptic as Heather was, in fact they were practically dying to tell me their stories about some weird thing that they'd seen or heard about. I guess that's a perk of being the new guy.

This guy who worked at the supermarket, (I think his name was Craig) told me more about those creepy dolls tied to the trees. Apparently, the first ones appeared in the 40's, and it started as a prank. Some girl tied her sister's doll to a tree as a joke, and her little sister couldn't find it, so it ended up lost in the woods. The next day, the girl fell into a coma, and she didn't wake up until her sister found the doll and took it down.

(Other people told me different stories, but this was the only one Heather didn't tell me about, and it was also the one with the most consistent details from person to person.)

He also said that all the dolls that people leave in the woods eventually appear on the trees, which would explain the mixture of old and modern dolls I saw.

I also talked to Travis, who went into more detail about the story his brother told me about. Apparently someone dared him on Halloween to go to the woods alone when he was seven, and he got lost. He was terrified, but "some freaky looking girl that looked like she'd crawled out of a T.V." helped him find his way out.

"She tried to talk to me, but I was too scared to respond. She was all bloody, and her neck was twisted, and I thought she was going to fuckin' kill me. I didn't even realize she was leading me out of the forest until I got out. I sort of feel bad for not thanking her, she was pretty friendly, and most of the spooky shit in Hinstone isn't. I got lucky."

Mrs. Garcia came over for dinner, and I ended up learning why my parents didn't want me to go into the forest. A girl had gone missing thirteen years ago. She was last seen entering Hinstone Forest.

"Her parents found a note in her bedroom, saying that she'd ran away, but her parents didn't believe that. People searched for years, but nothing came up. A lot of the kids 'round here say that fairies stole her away, but honestly, she probably got mixed up with that eternity cult. It's sad."

Her daughter, Selene, had a different explanation.

"Come on Mom, we all know the fairies took her."

"Stop making stuff up, it's disrespectful."

"I'm not making stuff up! The fairies probably ate her! New boy needs to know about them. They look super cute, but they're actually evil and they lure you away so they can eat you! That's why they never found a body. If she really joined that crackhead group, someone would've recognized her by now."

Mrs. Garcia glared at her.

"Selene. Stop. Now. You know her family hated when you told those stories at school."

"They don't even live here anymore! They moved to Saint's Harbor!"

"Saint's Harbor's only thirty minutes away from here, and they visit often. They've asked you numerous times to stop spreading that story."

Selene rolled her eyes.

"Ugh. Fiiine."

She wasn't the only one who told me about these fairies. Lots of the neighborhood kids did, but they all said Selene was the one who told them about it, so she probably made it up after all, and Mrs. Garcia's was most likely the correct one.

Sometimes, Heather would just run off right after she paid me, but sometimes she'd stay and talk for a while, and she told me a little more about Hawthorne's history during those conversations.

"So have ya got any hobbies?"

"I uh, like to draw and play video games...I had a garden at my old house, but I'm not sure if I'm going to start another one here, and I was on the swim team at my old school, but I don't know if I'll join the one at Westlake yet."

"If ya do, make sure ya wear a swim cap. The chlorine'll fry your hair. Also, if you see a shadow in the corner of your eye when you're swimming, leave the pool."

"Lemme guess, the pools are haunted?"

She laughed.

"Everywhere's haunted. The "haunted" places most people think about are the ones that are super mega haunted, so they stick out."

"So you're saying the whole town's haunted?"

"I didn't say the town, I said everywhere. Pay a little more attention, shorty!"

"But if everywhere was haunted, we'd have proof of ghosts by now, right?"

"I've got proof."

"Really? Show me, then."

"All you need to do is ask the guy you make-"

She fell silent for a moment.

"I need to ask who? Are you talking about the person I make deliveries to?"

By then, I knew the excuse she told me on that first day about giving the case to her friend Mia was a lie. The only person who lived in that house was a man named Mr. Wilson. I'd never actually spoken to him, (I was too nervous to, considering I was delivering a cello case full of who-knows-what to his door practically every day) but my neighbors mentioned him a couple of times."

"Forget it. I was making a shitty joke."

"So the person I deliver is also a ghost expert, huh? Am I delivering ghosts or something? Should I talk to him?"

"No! He doesn't know shit about ghosts! Don't talk to him! Just...forget I said anything."

She definitely let something slip that she didn't want me to hear. Part of me wanted to ask Mr. Wilson about the case, but I was still nervous about it, so I decided to put that aside for now, because I'd just made a huge breakthrough.

I finally managed to get a sample of that black goop that leaked out of the cello case, and after a little bit of searching online, I think I found out what it was.

It's mold. Specifically, it's a kind of mold that frequently grows in damp areas with a lot of paper or cardboard. So I probably wasn't transporting drugs, I doubt anyone would buy drugs that were covered in mold.

So what *was* in there?

Books, maybe? Or papers? I've seen people deliver secret documents in odd ways in spy movies, maybe Heather and Mr. Wilson are spies. That would explain why she's so secretive about everything, and where she's getting all that money from.

I decided I wasn't going to pry anymore. If I was working for spies, it was probably best if I remained ignorant. So I promised myself that I'd never think about the case ever again.

...That promise lasted for three hours.

See, my mom wanted to go to the thrift store, and she asked if I wanted to go with her. I almost said no, but I remembered the cards Heather gave me, so I ended up going.

The guy at the counter was tall and lanky, and his hair was bright blue. His lanyard was covered in enamel pins of Pokemon characters, and his nametag was covered in Pokemon stickers.

"Welcome to Fun Finds. My name's Kyle, let me know if you need help with anything."

My mom went off to look at the furniture, and when I was sure she was out of earshot, I set the Pokemon cards on the counter. I didn't want her to know about them because then she might ask where I got them from, and I was worried I wouldn't be able to come up with a good enough lie in time.

"Whoa, you collect too?"

"No, but I heard you did. Do you want these?"

"Hell yeah, little dude! I'll give you thirty bucks for all of them."

While he was looking through his wallet for the money, I looked at the stuff on the counter. It was mostly jewelry, but I saw these odd metal hairpin-looking things in the mix that looked out of place.

"What are those?"

"Hm? Oh, we think that's a lockpicking set. Why, you want them?"

As soon as the words came out of his mouth, I already knew what I was going to end up doing.

Even though it was a terrible idea.

I had to *know.*

So I bought it. I made up a BS story about how I do magic tricks in my spare time so buying them would be less suspicious, but I think that made him more suspicious than he was before, because I sounded really nervous.

I spent the rest of the day watching lockpicking tutorials on Youtube, and also probably getting on some sort of watchlist.

(FBI guy who watches my computer, if you're reading this, don't worry, I'm not gonna rob a bank or anything like that.)

I didn't have any padlocks to practice on, but by the time I went to bed, I was fairly confident that I could pick the ones on the cello case. All I had to do was wait until I had to make another delivery.

And I didn't have to wait for long. I got another text from Heather the next day.

So I left the house with my lockpicks, and walked to the outskirts of Hinstone Forest. The case was in the same spot as it always was. I dragged the case to a bush I could hide behind, and got to work opening the locks.

It took almost half an hour, but after a lot of frustration, and fiddling with the locks, I finally got them both off, and I was able to open the case.

And what I saw made me vomit.

Because what was inside wasn't drugs, or books, or secret documents. It was something I'd never even thought of. 

It was a corpse. I had been carrying a case with a corpse inside of it. But what was even more disturbing was that I could recognize it, even though it had started to decay quite a bit.

That long black hair, the familiar-looking clothes it was wearing...It was *Heather.* 

I shakily stood up, and walked home. I didn't know what to do. Should I tell my parents? Should I go to the police? What would I even say?

I pulled out my phone, ready to dial 911, when I heard the doorbell ring.

I opened the door. Heather was standing on the porch with her arms crossed.

"You looked, didn't you?"

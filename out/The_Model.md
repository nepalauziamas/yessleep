Been a while since I've made a mark in the art world, but then again, I can't complain much, had my big break before most people did, managed to weather the crash and keep a somewhat lavish lifestyle. Proof of that was not better shown anywhere else than in a place like this, a party in a penthouse loft in the middle of downtown, vestibule full of tuxes, short dresses and pearl necklaces. 

Quite the assortment of characters here, I thought, all showing some sort of mask. The gray-haired double-chinned politicians looking to grease the hands enforcing the "dry city" policy they preached while wetting their lips with Canadian whisky, hypocrites. Or the aspiring actresses and singers talking up the movie or radio executives, with a dress that had just a few more inches of cleavage than they cared to show. 

Then there's those like me, very few though, standing alone by a table sipping on a martini glass observing this melting pot of decadence, and in my case, hoping it'll light a match for my next piece. How original, a reflection of a rotted society, but I didn't care, I had had my days for originality, now I just needed to keep the bills paid. 

Such we were, high above the streets that day after day filled with more and more people kicked to the curb after an unlucky streak of bad decisions led the country here, while those responsible clanked glasses together. But leave that activism to someone younger, more idealistic. Like I used to be. 

Then I saw her, on the other side of the marble dance floor leaning against the wall, a kindred soul, observing. Though a casual observer wouldn't have noticed her like I did, what lay both plastered all over her and under the skin. Outside, she looked like any other desperate girl looking to make a living in high society, a black embroidered silk dress that ended right above the knee. A pearl choker that must've taken her dignity to afford. Hair short just barely covering her ears and again, dark as night. And like her peers a feathered headband, only unlike the rest of the girls here, her feather was bright red. Curiously, she was barefoot. 

'What's with the feet?' I asked, having left my post without giving it a thought, her pull as strong as gravity. 

'It's easier to dance this way' she said, a slight smile formed on her dark painted lips, she didn't even look at me 'heels hurt after a while'

'Do you dance much?' I leaned against the wall too, feigning confidence

'Sometimes' she finally looked at me 'with the right partner'
	
'Do I look like the right partner?'

'I don't know,' she took a sip from her drink. `What do you do for a living?'

'I'm an artist' I said, a little taken aback by such a forward question. 'You?'

'Well fancy that, just my luck' she chuckled lightly 'I'm a model'

'Well, that's nice' I looked at her directly now 'you looking for a job?'

'Why, do I look that desperate?' She looked away again, just observing 'or am I that enticing to the trained eye'

'Would you leave if I said it's a little bit of both'

'Funny' she looked at me and rolled her eyes

'I'm kidding, I came looking for a subject anyways, I hate stuff like this but I've gotten into this block I can't get out of, and drunk socialites make for decent pulp art'

'Well, I'm sure I can be of use then Mr. Artist' she reached out her hand, a few rings wrapped around fingers with black chipped fingernails 'the name's Lillian, Lillian Gahan, we'll see if you get to call me Lilly'

'Alright Miss Gahan' I shook her hand 'name's Adam, pleasure to meet you'

'Likewise,' she said humorously ''So did you want to dance? I'm bored but I didn't want to leave you hanging'

'That's alright, I was leaving soon anyways'

'I'll see you later then?'

'Will you come by my studio?'

'Sure, modeling for an artist instead of a camera sounds interesting. What do you want me to wear?'

'Come as you are now; I think I already have something in mind'

***
A few days or weeks later Ms. Gahan called me late at night, said she’d be at my studio the next day just before noon, she had freed up most of her day. Oh, I had to forgive her innocence, she didn’t know how long these art pieces could take. 

But I was surprised to see her red feather headband rise up my elevator at precisely 11am and strut about with such confidence as if she had posed for an artist a thousand times before. Maybe I had her all wrong. 

‘Is this the first time you’ve modeled for a portrait?’ I said pretending I’d forgotten what she told me at that party that seemed so long ago for some reason

‘Is that what you had in mind, dear, a portrait?’ Her lofty image of herself was evident in the tone of her words. But I must admit, her beauty was more astonishing under the bright lights of my studio than a dim penthouse chandelier. Much more enchanting than I had remembered. Truly I had a perfect subject.

‘Why do you ask” I said as I set up the easel and readied my graphite and oils. 

‘No reason’ her head swiveled, scanning the somewhat dirty art studio we found ourselves in, can’t blame an artist for living in squalor, we thrive off of it ‘It’s just I’m more used to producers trying to get my dress on the floor as fast as they can’

‘Oh, that won’t be necessary’ I said looking at her in the eyes ‘actually you are perfect as you are now’ I took a look at her again ‘might add a cigarette if that’s ok with you’ 

‘Sure, if it don’t bother you if I smoke it’ she chuckled

‘Not at all’ I said as I walked to a cabinet where I kept goods unrelated to my art ‘Can I fix you a drink too?’

‘Isn’t it a little early for that’ she finally took a seat in the stool I had placed for her the night before 

‘It’s an element in the painting’ I said in an attempt at a joke

‘Whatever you say art-man’ she sighed

‘It’s Adam’
	
‘I know’ 

A few minutes later I started my work. With a few snide comments from Lillian, I had posed her in almost a perfect reflection of what I saw at the party. Sitting on a stool, one leg on the peg, one leg extended, elbows on a table, cigarette holder on one hand and a martini on the other. Though now I wasn’t sure if I was going to paint a picture of the decadence that I saw that night, or if what I really wanted was to paint a picture of Lillian herself. 

Hours go by, broken by the puff of a cigarette, the sip from a martini glass or the strike of a lighter. However, I am entranced by her aura of temptation and dark glamour, though normally the slightest movement of my subject would irritate me, no matter how many adjustments she makes, how much the drink recedes or the cigarette burns out I don’t protest. It's as if I must capture every detail of the young dame sitting in front of me, even those impossible to capture in a full-length portrait, though that won’t keep me from trying.
	
‘Almost done?’ she shifted in place and said in a purposefully bratty tone I’m sure, such childish protests are beyond her
	
‘You know you can’t rush these things’ I almost snapped back, thinking she had taken away from that mysteriousness about her and had become just another broad with too high aspirations. Then I took a look out the window. ‘Oh, I hadn’t noticed it was dark already’
	
‘You hadn’t?’ she snorted ‘Sure, I’ll buy that. I can come back in about a week if that’s alright with you’

‘You can’t go back home by yourself at this hour, you know what kind of people roam these streets!’ I put my hands to decide
	
‘And what do you propose, spend the night? As if’ she said this after looking me up and down, but she was so right I wasn’t even offended by her backhanded insult 

‘Please stay and let me work until morning, I’ll pay you double’

‘Double? Until morning? Alright I think I can do that, not much different than what I’ve seen other girls do for “double”’
	
‘Great, that’s great’ I said as I put a brush on my mouth and went back to the painting again ‘famks’ I managed to babble, she took some amusement in that.
	
‘I just hope you know what you’re doing’ She went back to her pose ‘A camera works much quicker’

‘Trust me’ I said, hiding just how perfect I was aiming to make this painting, how perfect I was making her be, though to be truthful, I didn’t have to make so many adjustments to make her perfect. 

***
It’s rare as an artist to find art that makes itself. Even rarer to not be producing such art, but instead having it sitting in front of you, just a few feet from your eyes. Rarer still to see such perfection so closely, to know its intricacies, to be able to ask its most intimate details and still not be able to capture them. To be so close and yet so trapped by the medium as to make such perfection impossible. That’s what Lily was, she was living art, living art that I couldn’t reproduce with paint and oil. I needed more, I needed that piece that made her not just art, but art that was alive, and breathing.

‘You alright Adam?’ I didn’t realize my breathing had gotten heavy, her head snapped to look at me and her short hair bobbed slightly with the movement. 
	
‘Yeah, yeah it’s just, there’s something I can’t get right’
	
‘Is it my fault?’ Oh, her innocence
	
‘No no not at all Lilly’ she recoiled a bit at the use of her nickname, I didn’t mind it, I felt I had known her for her full life at this point ‘It’s the nature of these things’
	
‘Then what’s the issue?’

‘There’s…. Something missing, some essence I can’t capture with what I have right now but I know that…’ I looked at the razor I used for cutting the canvas, resting glistening on the table ‘I know that I can get it’

‘Alright then, I’m yours to keep for a few more hours’

I looked at the painting, truth is it was almost done, and I had outdone myself, as close to capturing her perfection as I could get. Just the bright red feather on her headband was missing the last layers of color. Such enchanting color that not a single one of the mixes I had done in the past half our could reach. But I knew where I could find it. 

‘Let me move you a little bit’ I stood up and moved towards her, she was still as a statue. I got behind her head and feigned the slightest movements and corrections, while the open razor slipped from my sleeve onto my palm in an instant. And then, in another, I had my color. 

She didn’t even scream, didn’t get the chance to. I had misjudged my strength and cut a half a finger deep slice into her neck, a bit rougher and I could’ve decapitated her entirely. With her windpipe severed all she could do was reach up and scratch my cheek for a few seconds while rich red spilled onto her dress and the floor. Even then she was perfect. 

Her body slumped from the stool and I put her down gently into the floor, closed her eyes and got to work. I had to be quick, before the color lumped and clotted, wasting it. First sticked a pair of scissors in the wound to keep it open, and flowing. I Had some alcohol on hand, perks of high society, that should give me some more time to work with. I knew it shouldn’t have worked, I had on accident spilled some blood into my paintings and it never stayed brown red, always clotted and turned rust-brown. But I had a feeling.

And I was right, like everything else about Lilly, her blood was excellent, more than that, it was exquisite, I waited and waited and the color didn’t change. Her feather was just as red and vibrant as it was on her now resting head. The piece was finished, I had done it, I had captured her in my canvas, I had captured the ideal mix of seduction and innocence, it was, in every sense of the word, perfect. 

Yet, as I looked at Lilly’s lifeless body, and back at the painting, and did so over hours, the sun never seemed to wish to rise, there was still… something missing. Some discrepancy between her and the painting, something different, it took me longer than it should’ve to realize it. 

She was no longer like she was in the painting, her pale skin was now even paler, colder. Her jet-back dress was now blood-stained and ruined, the painting didn’t match the perfection of the subject.

I rushed to her side but it was too late, my living paint had dried and seeped into the hardwood floor of the studio. I grabbed the razor and made another deep cut, this time in her thigh, but to my dismay what came out was no longer rich red, but rather dark and dead crimson. 
	
Running back to the painting I looked at my palette to see if any of my mixes matched the scarlet melancholy of her dress, or the snowy complexion of her skin. But then, as if to remind me that I could still reach perfection, I felt the razor handle pulse in my palm, beckoning me to use it once more. 

I knew what I had to do. I lined up the piece right in front of me, and lifted the blade up to my neck, sticking it out. 

The motion was swift, determined, I didn’t hesitate for I knew I served a higher purpose now; I served the painting, I served Lilly in her state of immaculateness. 

After the splatter I fell to my side, took down the easel and the canvas with me, the painting crashing to the floor and resting on its side, allowing me to see it again in all its glory.

I saw my own blood, my life I had given for the painting, dripping down Lilly’s dress, making it finally, perfect, the same perfection as she now had in the world of matter, she now had in the world of art. She had stopped living and finally became pure, flawless art. 

But, my vision blurs now, and I can’t do much but gargle, gargle in sadness that my time in this wretched world has come to an end, but also content, content that I am leaving this world with just a piece of the beauty it sorely lacked. 

Behind the painting, a figure rose, shambling at first, but then it regained its composure and grace. My eyes widen as Lilly rolls her neck, and rips the scissors from her throat, tossing them to the floor and rubs the place where I cut her. 

She clears her throat a few times before speaking. 
	
‘Well, that was, a bit unpleasant’ her voice sounds raspier than before ‘But no worries darling, I knew you’d pull this off’

My breathing accelerates. She sticks her fingers into her wound again, getting some of her bright red blood on them. She reaches down to me, in front of the painting, I can’t move, only follow her with my eyes as she cocks her head and smiles in now dark bloody lips. She runs her fingers down my cheek, down to my now open neck and reaches in, I choke on her fingers as they roll around deep in my wound. She takes them out. 

‘There, now you’ll die with a part of me’ She turns around and stands up, picking up the painting ‘And I’ll leave with some part of you’

Before my world goes black, I hear her heels clicking against my floor, the elevator doors open, and see a bright red feather disappear as like me, it descends into the darkness.

Maybe it’s just something about flights, but they’ve always made me drowsy.

&#x200B;

Now, I wasn’t exactly planning on sleeping during that particular flight, but I couldn’t really help myself either. About fifteen minutes after the plane took off, I started to doze. Sure, I tried to stay awake, but it was starting to feel like a losing battle. My eyes drooped and I started to drift. Some part of me couldn’t help but feel a little bit guilty for that, considering that I wasn’t just on this plane to get to Miami.

&#x200B;

While she’d never come out and said it, I’d figured that Sasha probably had some ulterior motives for offering me a private flight that weekend. I wasn’t complaining. I know how she is and honestly, there’s a lot of benefits to being her friend.

&#x200B;

The first is that she’s loaded and she likes to show it off. Her family made their money in the stock market and as a result, she’s grown up to be just a little spoiled. She’s always got some new toy to show off and the private plane was one of her newest ones. To her credit, she’d made a point to learn how to fly it herself and as far as I could tell, she knew what she was doing.

&#x200B;

Now, I’m not going to pretend as if her money was the main or only reason we were friends. I can afford to live a pretty comfortable life myself and I wouldn’t have ever met Sasha if we weren’t running in the same circles. But money isn’t the end all/be all. I’ve got plenty of friends who aren’t as well off as Sasha is too and I give them all the same amount of love. Literally in most cases…

&#x200B;

How do I phrase this gently? I fuck for a living. A lotta people only like porn stars for the fantasy we sell and regard the people behind that fantasy with disgust as if we’re somehow less than human just because they jack off to us. But on the plus side, I make decent money, travel a lot, meet a lot of people, and have some fun while I do it. I won’t pretend the business is all sunshine and rainbows… The industry is just as shady and greedy as a lot of people say it is. At the end of the day, everything you see on camera is a fantasy. The reality behind the scenes will always be something else entirely. There’s some shitty people here. I’ve had friends who’ve been chewed up and spit out by it in the worst ways... But there are also people like me who simply like what they do. I don’t apologize for that. I admittedly wouldn’t recommend it to most people… But some people thrive in here and I’m lucky enough to be one of them.

&#x200B;

I’m aware that some of my friends only hang out with me for the sake of saying they’ve hung out with a porn star. But I’d say I’m good at sorting out the ones just looking for attention from the ones who are genuinely interested in me. Over the past three years, I’d come to see Sasha as one of the latter. She wasn’t looking for attention or clout. Like me, she just wanted to drink some good booze, eat at some nice restaurants and have a damn good time. And if sometimes a night out ended up with us in bed together… Well… I wasn’t against it.

&#x200B;

Our relationship was never romantic. We’d both dated other men and women on and off. But when those relationships ended, we’d end up back in each other's beds.

&#x200B;

Truth be told… I almost preferred her over most of the people I’ve dated… Sasha got me. We could talk for hours on end, jumping between different topics with the same enthusiasm. And when it came to the bedroom… She was something else. She kissed better than anyone else I’ve ever met and the sight of her lying back on my bed, offering herself to me was probably one of the most erotic things I’ve ever seen in my life. She did this little lip bite when she was really turned on… It was adorable. She’d watch me closely as I climbed on top of her, waiting with baited breath for me to touch her and when I did, she barely seemed to be able to contain just how much she wanted it. It was cute… And it made me feel… Content, I guess? Happier than I’d been with anyone else, at least.

&#x200B;

As I sat in my seat by the window, I listened to the hum of the low altitude. It had been a couple of months since Sasha and I had the chance to get together, so this was bound to be fun. For the first time in a while, I felt unburdened… Like I was free to do whatever I wanted. And at that moment, I wanted nothing more than for Sasha to join me. She didn’t keep me waiting for long.

&#x200B;

The door to the cockpit opened. I saw Sasha look back at the other pilot and say something to him. I recognized him as one of her personal assistants. Then, she closed the door and sauntered over to me with a grin. I stretched out in the reclining seat and yawned just as she drew near.

&#x200B;

“Morning, sleepyhead.” She crooned. She looked through the window, out into the blue sky outside.

“Is it still morning?” I asked before she leaned down for a kiss.

“Barely. You were out for a good 45 minutes or so.”

“Was I?”

&#x200B;

Shit. I didn’t think I’d actually dozed off…

“I’m sorry.”

“It’s fine. Don’t you worry… We’ve still got lots of time for you to make it up to me.”

“I’m open to any ideas,” I said.

&#x200B;

She stole another kiss before getting up and beckoning me with a finger to follow her to the back of the plane. She’d cut her hair recently into a short bob cut that framed her face perfectly and she had an excited wiggle to her step. Her skirt hugged her thighs in a way that made it hard not to stare.

&#x200B;

Near the back of the plane was a small cabin with a single queen sized bed inside. She crawled down on top of it, giving me a view up her skirt. She wasn’t wearing anything underneath, and I could see that she was already soaked.

&#x200B;

“So… You ever joined the mile high club?” She teased as she flopped down onto her back, leaving her legs open so I could see everything.

“I actually haven’t… But I’d be happy to make you a member…” I said, crawling down onto the bed with her. I leaned down to kiss her, holding her close as I did.

God, this just felt right…

&#x200B;

I felt her wrapping her arms around me, clinging to me as we kissed. I brought my lips down to her neck next and heard her gasp in pleasure.

“God, Karly… I’ve missed this.”

“Me too, hun… Guess life just gets in the way.”

“Tell life to fuck off. I want you all to myself.”

She kissed me again before grabbing my wrist and guiding my hand down between her legs. I was happy to oblige her.

&#x200B;

When we were done, Sasha lay cuddled up to me, her head resting on my shoulder as I rested against her. I could feel her legs still shaking a little and took a certain satisfaction in knowing what I’d done to her. I planted gentle little kisses on top of her head as I ran my fingers through her hair.

“Did I tell you how much I love that look on you?” I whispered to her.

“You do?” She looked up, cracking a slight smile.

“Yeah. You look gorgeous.”

&#x200B;

I leaned in for another kiss.

“You’re sweet.” She said before nestling her head into my neck. I saw her close her eyes and almost teased her for starting to doze… But I didn’t really mind if she slept. I was honestly starting to drift too.

&#x200B;

I felt the plane rock violently beneath us, jarring me awake again.

Sasha sat up suddenly, her brow furrowing.

“Everything alright?” I asked.

She got up suddenly, grabbing her shirt and pulling it back on, followed by her skirt.

&#x200B;

“It should be… That was a hell of a bump. I’m just going to check with the pilot.”

Once she was at least decent, she stepped outside the door, heading towards the cockpit again. I stayed in bed for a few moments, reflecting on the look of concern on her face before finally heading towards the window of the cabin.

&#x200B;

Looking out, I could see that the blue sky had turned grey. A heavy cloud cover made it impossible to see the ground below.

&#x200B;

The plane rocked violently again, almost throwing me off my feet.

&#x200B;

I made my way over to the door, looking out and seeing the cockpit door was open. I didn’t see Sasha. I hastily got dressed before leaving the bedroom and heading out to check on her.

&#x200B;

The plane was starting to shake now as we entered heavy turbulence. My common sense told me to sit down but I couldn’t help but be a little worried about Sasha. I gripped the seats for support as I made my way towards the cockpit and when I was near the halfway point, I saw something bright shoot past the window.

&#x200B;

I paused. It had all gone by in an instant… But I swore that I’d seen bright lights just outside!

&#x200B;

The plane shook violently again. This time it was hard enough to knock me off my feet and send me crashing to the ground with a yelp of pain. I saw Sasha’s head turn from one of the cockpit chairs, looking at me with wide eyes as I picked myself up.

&#x200B;

“What the hell’s going on?” I asked, “Did we hit a storm or something?”

“I don’t know…” She replied. Her voice was shaking, “Karly, I don’t know what’s happening.”

&#x200B;

Her tone made me pause. I’d known Sasha for a few years now and I’d never before heard that tone in her voice before. It was fear. Cold, gripping terror… And it made my blood run cold.

&#x200B;

I hurried towards the cockpit. As I moved, I saw lights soar past the window again. I paused to look. For a moment, I wondered if it was lightning… But lightning doesn’t look like that. Lightning is a single bolt. A blinding flash. No. There was something flying around us.

&#x200B;

The plane shook, nearly knocking me off my feet again. I made my way into the cockpit and looked down at Sasha gripping the controls. Her assistant in the seat beside her was slumped over. He looked passed out at a glance. Then I saw the blood trickling out of his mouth and felt my heart stop in my chest. He wasn’t unconscious. He was dead.

&#x200B;

Sasha looked to be on the verge of tears. Her skin had gone pale white. Pale fog raced past the cockpit window… And I saw the lights shoot by again, soaring over us and vanishing into the fog. Sasha let out a panicked scream as they did and this time, I got a better look at whatever was harassing us.

&#x200B;

It was another plane.

&#x200B;

I only managed to identify it by the position of the lights that should have been on the tips of its wings… I never got a look at the plane itself. It was almost as if it wasn’t even there.

&#x200B;

“H-he keeps swooping around us…” Sasha stammered, “Radio’s jammed… Navigation isn’t working. Autopilot’s failed… I… I don’t know what else to do… I…”

“Can you bring us lower?” I asked.

“Maybe… But I don’t know exactly where we are right now. Our altitude reader’s all over the place. Cloud cover is too thick… If we fly too low, we could hit something. Fly too high, and he might just hit us.”

&#x200B;

I opened my mouth to say something else but wasn’t sure what… I had no advice to give. All I could do was watch as Sasha tried not to get us killed.

&#x200B;

“I don’t know…” She murmured, “I don’t know, I don’t know…”

I could see the lights coming again as the other plane came back for another pass. Sasha gritted her teeth and tried to steer us away from it as it seemed to rocket over our heads. I felt the plane shake violently again, this time worse than before. Sasha let out a terrified scream.

&#x200B;

“Oh God, oh Fuck! Fuck, he just fucking hit us!”

“He hit us?” I asked in disbelief.

“I-it felt like it. Just a graze I think but I… I don’t… *Fuck!*”

She looked at the dials, watching as their numbers changed rapidly. I could see her weighing the pro’s and cons… Finally, she swore under her breath.

&#x200B;

“I’m taking us down.” She said, “If we stay up here he’s going to keep hitting us… According to the flight plan, we should be over farmland right now… As long as I’m right about where we are, we should be okay…”

&#x200B;

She forced the plane down. I watched as the fog rushed past us, leaving drops of condensation on the windows. I could see a single tear slipping down Sasha’s cheeks and I hugged her from behind.

“You’re doing great…” I whispered to her, “You’re doing great, honey…”

It was the only thing I could offer.

&#x200B;

Her eyes shifted over to the dead man in the seat beside her. I moved to block her view of him.

“Don’t think about that, alright honey? Think about me. Listen to the sound of my voice. You can do this, alright? We’re going to get out from under the clouds and we’re going to make an emergency landing… We’re going to be okay. Can you say it with me?”

“W-we’re going to be okay…” She murmured, “Oh God… Karly, I’m sorry… I… I’m sorry I didn’t want to…”

“Shh… it’s okay. Don’t apologize. You’ve got this. I’m here. You’ve got this…”

&#x200B;

I gently kissed the back of her head, and I could feel her starting to relax a little. Her breathing was still heavy and anxious.

“You’ve got this. We’re going to be okay.” I assured her, “I’m right here. No matter what…”

She wiped some of the tears from her eyes.

&#x200B;

The clouds faded away, revealing farmland far beneath us. I felt Sasha breathe a sigh of relief.

“We’re okay….” She repeated…

&#x200B;

Then the plane shook again as something hit us.

&#x200B;

I screamed and grabbed Sasha instinctively as our view began to spin. For a few moments, my body felt as if it weighed nothing at all and I swear that for a few seconds, I was floating. I saw the lights of the other plane shoot past us before blinking out entirely in an odd flash of light. When they were gone, I saw nothing else in the sky.

&#x200B;

“No, *no*, *NO*! H-he just took out our fucking engine! We’ve lost a goddamn wing! Fuck… FUCK!”

She tried to hold the plane steady but I could feel it listing to the side.

“I can’t… Karly, I’m losing it!”

&#x200B;

Oh God… We were going down…

&#x200B;

“No, no, no… Not like this, please no…” Sasha sobbed, desperately clinging to the controls. But it was all in vain. The plane was dipping down further. We were going to crash.

“I’m sorry… I-I’m sorry…”

I wrapped my arms around her, squeezing her close.

“It’s okay Karly… It’s okay… I love you…”

&#x200B;

I wish I could say that just slipped out but no… No it didn’t. I meant what I said to her. In that moment, I truly thought I was going to die and I thought to myself that if I was going to die, then I wanted those to be my last words.

&#x200B;

Sasha looked over at me, eyes wide. I knew she’d understood why I’d said what I’d said… And those words that were meant to comfort her instead filled her with terror. She fought back the tears in her eyes and I wanted to pull her close and hug her one last time. But I didn’t. I couldn’t.

&#x200B;

Her grip remained firm on the controls. She looked back out through the window of the cockpit before swearing under her breath and deploying the landing gear.

“You need to get back… Near the wings… Get between the seats, keep your head between your legs.”

“What? What about you?” I asked.

“I’m going to try and get us down as gracefully as I can…”

&#x200B;

I should have gone. But I stayed. I couldn’t leave her to do this alone.

&#x200B;

Sasha tried to ease the plane lower, fighting a losing battle to make it to stay level all the while. The ground rushed up beneath us.

“Need to keep the speed up… If we slow down, we’ll start to plummet…” I heard her say… “No, no, no…”

&#x200B;

Above us, I could see the lights of the other plane.

“He’s back…” I said weakly.

Sasha looked up and swore under her breath.

“God, please no…”

&#x200B;

I expected the other plane to dive on us again. But it seemed to just float on by… A pair of distant lights high above us. And the longer I looked… The more I saw other lights with it… Other planes in among the clouds. Some big, some small… All of them battered and damaged.

&#x200B;

There were so many… More than I could hope to count.

&#x200B;

Looking up at those planes, I caught myself wondering how they even managed to stay up… It was like looking at a graveyard in the sky. As I stared, I started to see what was beyond them… A shimmering light of reds, greens, pinks and blues… Like an aurora borealis yet different. There was something else in the sky. Something beyond the ruined planes.

&#x200B;

The ground was rushing up beneath us. Sasha struggled to keep the plane righted.

“Brace…” She cried, “*Brace, brace, brace!*”

&#x200B;

I dove into the space between her seat and the wall, tucking my head under my arms. Sasha dashed out of her seat, to a spot behind the co-pilots chair and did the same.

&#x200B;

I felt us hit the ground. The plane shook violently. I felt it buckle and tear. I heard the screech of metal grinding against the ground. I swear I felt it as the landing gear snapped. Sasha screamed as we skidded. I felt the plane lurch violently and heard the sound of wind suddenly roaring past us as the rear half of the plane was ripped away. The cockpit rocked violently before it finally slowed.

&#x200B;

Then came the silence.

&#x200B;

My ears were ringing. I could hear my pulse pounding in my skull. My every bone ached more than it ever had and I could taste blood in my mouth. My vision was blurry. But I was alive.

&#x200B;

Immediately, I looked over at Sasha. She lay crumpled in her crash position, blood running down her face. I felt a stab of panic in my chest as I scrambled on legs of jelly towards her.

“No, no, no!”

&#x200B;

I grabbed her, pulling her out of her position. I could barely carry her… But I had to. I heard her let out a weak groan of pain that filled me with relief as I slung one arm over my shoulder and pulled her out of the cockpit. We stumbled through the broken ruins of the plane until we came out from the mid-section where it had split in two.

&#x200B;

I kept dragging her, half conscious through the mud and debris beneath our feet.I dragged her as far as I could until my legs finally gave out and I collapsed beside her.

&#x200B;

My eyes shifted over to Sasha’s, and I saw her looking at me, barely conscious… But alive. I rolled onto my back, looking up at the cloudy sky one last time. I half expected to see the dead planes above us and the aurora beyond them.

But they were gone.

We were alone.

Blackness filled my vision as I slipped into unconsciousness.

&#x200B;

All things considered, I’d say we were both incredibly lucky.

&#x200B;

When the police came to investigate the crash, they found Sasha and I a few feet away from the wreckage, both unconscious. We spent a few months in the hospital afterward, recovering from the broken bones, concussions, and overall trauma of surviving a plane crash. But we both survived. We both healed… And we had each other.

&#x200B;

The time we’ve spent together after the accident has brought us closer together… I didn’t leave her side for a few months after we got out of the hospital. We’re taking things slow but… I’m happy to be with her. I’m happy that I still get to be alive with her. So I suppose that’s something. I know that she feels the same.

&#x200B;

Sasha’s plane went down over Kansas. The wreckage was strewn across the better part of three miles, but thankfully nobody except the other pilot was killed.

&#x200B;

According to local air traffic, there were no other planes in the area that day. Our flight path should have been clear and there were no signs of any other planes among the wreckage. Nobody can explain how our wing went missing. But I’ve heard people say it that it was either damaged before we took off and got torn off by the wind during the flight, or that we just hit a bad storm. I don’t believe either of those theories. I know what I saw that day.

&#x200B;

Did you know that since 1948, more than 90 commercial aircraft have vanished without a trace? And who knows how many smaller aircraft have disappeared over the years…

&#x200B;

Sometimes I think about what I saw in the sky before we crashed. I wonder if maybe I saw some of those missing planes up there, trapped by something I could never hope to understand. I wonder how close we were to joining them that day… Then I stop myself from thinking about it any further.

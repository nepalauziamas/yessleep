I had just arrived at the cabin; I expected to be met with a gorgeous property, covered by lively flora and populated with singing birds and other forest creatures. However, what I saw was the exact opposite. The place was completely different from what had been showcased on the internet. The house was not beautiful as it had been shown to be, rather, it was unsightly and appeared to be rotting. I tried not to give it much thought, as this was a fairly common practice for people showing off their homes. As long as I wasn’t the one living there, I didn’t really mind, though, a full week in those conditions might as well have been a lifetime. I guess for some people, it was. 

Resolute in thought, I began to remind myself that everything that had previously gone down was all just in my head; a byproduct of fantasy and poisoning from the gas leak, and that's what my doctors would tell you if they weren’t bound by a patient confidentiality contract. Anyway, I figured a change of scenery would be what I needed to calm myself down. I pulled up to the driveway and slowed down, putting my head out the window. 
    
“Are you the couple looking for a housesitter?” I asked.
    
“Oh, yes. Go ahead and pull in.” The old man confirmed. They started talking to each other, but I couldn’t hear whatever they were saying. The driveway was surprisingly small, so I had little room to spare between my vehicle and theirs without veering off of the concrete. After getting out of the car I walked over to the couple and hesitantly asked them if they needed any help packing.

“Do you need a hand with those?” 

“Ah, we’re fine. Don’t give us any mind hun, we’ve got this covered. Go on in and make yourself comfortable.” The old lady said with glee implanted in her voice, while the old man nodded his head concurrently.

“Alright, then. Oh, and thank you for the opportunity, I appreciate the job, really.” I replied. 

“Before you go in, I have to tell you the most important of all the rules.” The man blurted out as I turned my back.

“Rules?” I replied in confusion. I had seen everything on the email, so what other rules could there have been? I thought to myself. 

“They’re very important, so make sure you listen up.” He said in a more serious tone. 

“Alright, I hear you. Very important rules, sure.” I said in acknowledgement.

“You need to knock before you enter any room in the house. If you hear a knock back, you do not enter, under any circumstances. If you need in, you’ll have to wait and try again later.” The man said in a tone that sounded even more serious than before. The look on his face told me he was not joking. 

“I thought I was going to be the only one staying for the week?” I questioned him.

“Yeah, that's right.” The man insisted.

“I don’t understand. Are you making a joke?” I said with a fake chuckle. I knew they weren’t. Nobody would joke like that, but at this point I was fed up with all the ridiculous things going on, and just wanted to get some peace and quiet. If I had to sit through one more crazy day I was going to fucking explode.

“Look, just follow the rules and you’ll get by fine. Oh, and I wouldn’t advise staying up past 12 AM. That’s when things start to get…rowdy. There's only a couple more things to tell you, but we have to get going now, times running short. There will be a note attached to the fridge that has all the information you’ll need.” The old man stated. I decided not to respond, primarily because I didn’t know how. I was running short on new words that I could use to describe my “Confusion,”and “fear,” and other similar feelings. I turned around and slowly approached the front door. Unlike the rest of the cabin, the door was in great shape. It was polished, and had a gleaming golden door knob. I put my hand to the cold metal and twisted it open with absoIute ease. I was completely surprised by the interior decor of the cabin. 

There were expensive looking fur rugs spanning the surface of the hard-wood floors, and marble counters that hosted bowls of many fresh fruits and vegetables in the kitchen. There wasn't any physical evidence of rotting from the inside of the cabin whatsoever, and everything was clean and organized. The floor was polished the same way as the door and had a sheen to it that softly reflected the light of the several lamps decorating the home. Now I was definitely beginning to feel at home. Thinking that I had judged the place to soon, I made my way to the large suede couch in the living room and plopped on it like I owned the place. I rested my head on the end and closed my eyes. 

The logical thing to do would have been to check out the rest of the house first. However, I was absolutely destroyed from my lack of sleep and needed to get some rest. Unfortunately for me, that was also around the same time that those caffeine pills I took began to peak. But I wasn’t going to let anything stand in the way of me getting some sleep, be it a rush of caffeine or a demonic entity, I had my priorities set. Well, that's what I told myself. I laid there for around 45 minutes before realizing that my priorities were apparently going on a very brief vacation, because I just couldn’t relax. I figured I would have better odds on a real bed, so I got up and walked around the house for a moment before deciding which door would lead to the bedroom. 

The couple hadn’t told me anything about the internal layout of the house so I was forced to use context clues to make a guess. I noticed one of the doors in the hallway had an open closet adjacent to it, which was filled to the brim with blankets. That was definitely the bedroom. I started to open the door, but stopped myself. What was that rule again? Knock before entering a room? I thought about it for a second, then decided that I would at least try to do whatever crazy nonsense it was that they had asked of me. I mean, they must have given me these instructions for a reason, regardless of how nebulous they seemed.

I knocked on the door then waited for about three seconds. Nothing happened. I figured that was my sign that It was okay to enter the room, so I did. I was absolutely dumbfounded by what I saw. The room was filled with all sorts of crazy knick knacks and items filed in rows alongside these wonderfully carved shelves and bureaus. There was a fancy-looking music box, handmade dreamcatchers, wooden lockboxes, and a plethora of other old-timey objects adorned with shiny metals and intricate designs. 

The bed was queen-sized and had many layers of blankets folded perfectly atop it. The blankets looked like you could wrap yourself up in them and never come out, a proposal that didn’t sound half-bad to me at the time. I crawled onto the mattress and it concaved with the weight of my body, sending ripples across the bed wrap and disrupting the order of the folded blankets. While laying there I had this familiar comfort that flirted with my tendency to stay in bed all day, and at that moment I felt every strange effect reduce to a whisper within my mind, and I had order and peace. This is amazing, I thought to myself. 

After passing out my mind began to construct a dream where I lay beside an old birch tree with pink leaves and a pattern of faces etched within the wood. The carvings of faces within the tree seemed to resemble my own, except each hosted their own slight differences, such as longer hair or noticeably smaller eyes, and they all seemed to look horrified, as if their likeness were carved upon the tree in a moment of shock that resided in still time. I tried  not to directly react to the faces, instead I did my best to look away from them. They seemed to somehow call out to me, despite the fact that they couldn’t speak. 

I would find myself glancing back at them, only for their look of horror to intensify each time I shared their gaze. I suddenly couldn’t move my legs. I was stuck there, in a constant battle with myself, turning away only to find myself fighting the urge to look back around. Everytime I glanced back, I felt my body begin to slowly lose control, like being in their disturbing presence was absolving me of all worldly responsibility. Then out of the blue, a distorted voice began to ring out in my mind.

“Crossover horizon…leave…event…you have to esca-'' The voice cut off before it could finish speaking, but something about it seemed distant from my dream, as if it were from somewhere else entirely, perhaps a lost avenue of my mind. I didn’t know what it meant, but I felt as if I should have. It seemed important, but I just had no clue what to make of it. However, I knew one thing for sure, after hearing that voice I no longer felt the urge to turn around and watch the perpetually twisting faces. 

I was finally able to get a good look at my surroundings. Immediately, I noticed that there were more trees, a lot more, but all of them were incredibly far away and vastly spread out. Every tree had its own set of indistinguishable faces that contrasted with the wood they resided upon. I continued my study of the other trees and found them to all be abandoned. I was the only person here.

The feeling in my body began to come back, so I slowly lifted my legs from the ground, and made my way over to one of the other trees. I approached a large spruce, and what I saw almost horrified me. What I had previously assumed to be the shapes of faces in the tree were actually endless swirls that seemed to incomprehensibly twist inside and out of themselves. If they had once resembled faces, I could not possibly tell now. Then I felt my eyes begin to peer towards the bottom of the trunk. 

There was a smooth incline in the dirt, like a figure was only just below, resting and paralized. Through the passing of time, the dirt had accumulated over and hid it from the world. I tried to dig the shallow grave up and reveal what was surely a body trapped beneath, but the more I dug the deeper it seemed to go, until the tomb was almost three feet deeper than it had been before. After realizing the futility of my efforts, I gave up and began to rest upon my knees, covered in dirt and sweat. I wiped my brow and took a deep breath. That's when a heavy wind began to blow through the land. The noise it produced sounded like the wailing of a sad God, sending currents like riptides of air which blew about all manners of life in its path, wreaking havoc upon the land. The ground began to crumble and fall apart, and the trees were being ripped out from their roots and flung into the now grey sky. The world was literally falling into the abyss around me. 

Somehow I knew that If I didn’t make it back fast enough, my tree would be swept up along with the rest of them, and for some yet unknowable reason, I just couldn’t let that happen. I began to launch my feet from the ground but the weakness had started to set back in as I faced the tree. I resisted and kept running, pushing myself harder and harder past my ever-expanding limits.

I should have just looked away from the tree, but I couldn’t. It was as if any other direction would leave me distorted by the white void that remained beyond the remnants of the collapsing world. I kept running until the path behind me began to crack and erupt with white fog that manifested into a miniature cumulonimbus. The seemingly sentient cloud levitated just overhead, spitting out lighting towards me, with each strike barely missing by the hair of a chin. I felt as if an other-worldly entity was making its last attempt to try and stop me from reaching the tree, like it wanted to sever me from it and leave me stranded in the void. For what reason I could not know. 

Running became a difficult feat as I could now barely feel my legs, and my ankles had started to shake beneath the dead weight of my numbing body. The tree was so close, and I was nearly there, yet I knew I would not be able to make it in time If I didn’t do something about my progressing ailment. I forced myself to look away from the tree and into the beyond, which gave me just the boost I needed to keep going. However, as I gazed upon the pure white void the world slowed down to an agonizing crawl. I felt my perception of time begin to increase while all motion blur depleted in an instant. I could see everything around me with perfect clarity. It was like the world was moving in slow motion. I ran for what felt like hours, but sure enough, I began to close in on the tree. I could no longer look away from its esoteric carvings, and was forced to view it once again. 

Time started to speed back up, and as it did, my entire body flew into the base of the tree, knocking me out cold. I immediately woke up from my nap to the sound of screaming. I investigated the room with a quick scan, before realizing that the screaming was coming from myself. I gripped my hands to my face and buried my head into my knees as I sat up in the bed. Then I began to shiver, as if the temperature had suddenly fallen rapidly. My teeth chattered and grinded together in the midst of the cold. I looked over at the wall, and saw the thermostat. I forced myself from the covers and over to it, only to find that it had been set to 22°F. How could that be? It's just me here. It's just…me, right? I kept on asking myself that question, while hoping the answer would never need to be known to me. 

“Is there someone out there?” I said loudly. I opened the door and pushed my face out just enough to peak into the hallway. I was beginning to think that the thermostat was automated and had just bugged out, but then I saw something. A black shadow ran through the living room as quickly as the blink of an eye…

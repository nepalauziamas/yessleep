There's something wrong with the house. I’ll give you some background on it. My neighbourhood is small and peaceful, the safety measures taken is what usually brings people to buy houses. Every single house is bought except one. The one right next to mine. It's been abandoned for the past 15 years. I’m 26 years old now but I’ve been seeing this house empty ever since I was 11. There used to be a family and their children there, I’ve even played football with them in the street a couple times.

The house stands the same as it did the day it was abandoned 15 years ago. A very ordinary looking white house, the paint crumbling and breaking apart due to lack of maintenance. The gate on the house is completely rusted, once you enter the gate there's a garage on the ground floor and stairs leading up to the main door. To the right of the gate are stairs leading to an overgrown garden, looks more like a forest, trees with branches that looked like arthritic fingers, bushes that had not been trimmed in 15 years, the grass coming up to my shin, garbage and debris thrown all around. Crossing the garden you come across this porch with a dried out pond and sliding door leading inside the house, all the glass on the windows and doors are completely smashed.

Considering the condition of the house, it’s surprising to hear that the old family has a guard patrolling it to keep it safe. However, last week, while I was on my way home from work, I saw a patrol car parked outside and there he was the guard, hunched over, breathing heavy, while everyone was there trying to make sense of what he was saying, he just kept saying, “it doesn’t make sense, it doesn't make sense”. He was asked to hand over his badge and gun and report to the office for suspension due to mental instability.

Being the curious type I am, I decided to check out the house. I don't believe in the supernatural, so entering an abandoned, dark house didn't scare me. Around 1 am, I opened the front gate and went inside, thankfully, there was no replacement guard yet and I got in easily. I took the path to the right that led through the garden and into the side sliding door with the broken glass. The sliding door led to the dining area, and it looked exactly as you’d imagine, the table was slit down the middle, the chandelier rested above it. Probably fell down and broke the table with it. Everything was covered in spider webs and dust including the 2 shelves that I’m assuming used to store plates and pans. The paintings on the wall were completely cracked and blistered by the direct 41 degree Celsius sunlight hitting it through the cracked sliding door glass for 15 years. Across from the table was a door that I assumed led to the living room.

As I opened the door this disgusting odour filled my nose, I almost puked as I pinched my nose to stop the smell, good thing this is during COVID times so I always carry a mask with me. I put on my mask and shun my light around the depressing, worn down living room in search of what could be causing the smell. As I swerved the light left and right it hit something in the corner of the room. I moved closer and to my dismay, there it was the corpse of the security guard, It was still fresh. How?! I wondered, just yesterday he was outside the house, getting suspended for psychotic issues. I didn’t want to find out who did this to him so I quickly did a 180 and dashed towards the dining room door. I searched every wall in the room, but the door was gone? I was sure I just forgot where it was and it was too dark so I kept going back to the same wall, but after taking another round I was sure the door was gone.

I stared at the wall where the dining room door had been, feeling around for a hidden button or something, hoping it would fling open if I pressed it, but there was nothing, just the crumpled up wallpaper, peeling from all sides of the wall. I turned around and shunned my light across the living room to find a path to move ahead. Maybe there was a way to the main door with the staircase that led outside.  As I reached the middle of the dining room, I felt something crawl up my leg. I assumed it was a spider, patted my jeans and continued forward but then I felt maybe 5 or 6 more creatures crawling on me. I quickly rolled up my pants and saw something crawling under my skin, dropping my flashlight. I shook violently trying to get rid of anything else that might crawl under my skin. I tried to find something sharp to cut my leg open and take it out, I picked up a piece of broken glass from the TV screen and made an incision in my leg, blood started pouring out but there was nothing there. Suddenly the sensations stopped, I picked up my flashlight and looked around my feet to see if something had come out but there was nothing there.

Bleeding from my leg, I pulled out a bandanna that I had in my backpack, and tied it around my leg to stop the bleeding, it would have to do for now until I found a way out. As I came back to my senses, I heard whistling coming from upstairs. I pointed my light to the right and what was once a dead end, now had stairs leading to the second floor of the house. Having no other way out I decided to move forward. I climbed up the stairs, each and every step creaked like it was just about to give in under me. The whistling got louder and louder as I climbed the stairs, as soon as I reached the top there was only 1 door. I touched the doorknob and the whistling stopped. Taking a deep breath, not excited to see what was behind the door, I slowly swung the door open, and in front of me was a dark empty corridor. It was so dark I could not even see what was on the other side. I slowly crept up, thinking I would hit another door any minute but I kept walking and walking. While walking I noticed parts of my body shifting and changing sizes, I felt like I was Alice in wonderland, seeing the most bizarre things. My perception of time and space felt distorted. Everything felt as if it was moving slowly, gravity felt different, I felt light on my feet, the same way I would after taking a massive bong hit. 

As I walked for what felt like hours, I couldn’t tell because the hands on my watch were frozen, my flashlight hit something that looked like legs. There was black ooze dripping from the top so I slowly raised my flashlight to see what it was. That's when I saw the most horrific thing. It was a humanoid figure that looked burnt to charcoal. There was still flesh on it that was covered and oozing in blood. Its eyes were bloodshot red and its arms reached up to its knees and fingernails that reached the floor. I, almost having a panic attack, snapped myself out of it and ran back to where I came from. I felt slow, like someone running from his killer in his dreams. I tried to run faster and faster but the bizarre difference in gravity wouldn’t let me. I looked back and the creature was making its way towards me, scratching its fingernails on the floor, its face was changing, it was turning into me. I saw the door I came in, slammed it open and shut behind me, I took the nearest heavy item I could find and barricaded the door with it, waiting for a slam on the door that never came. I slid down the wall and sat down trying to catch my breath. I wasn’t ready to see what the next room in the house had in store for me. That thing transformed into me, it now made sense how that security guard was dead in the house but taken away just a day before, It's because it wasn't him.

After catching my breath I shunned my light around the next room and what I saw was what made me write to you guys on Reddit. There's hundreds of them. They’re sleeping on the floor, stuck to the walls and the ceiling. They don't know I’m here and I’m too afraid to make a sound. I don’t think I can outrun them this time, there's too many and I don’t even know where the next door is. It's too dark, what if I bump into another dead end full of them. I think this might be it for me, there's no way out, the house doesn't let you leave, but what I do know is one of these things did leave the house imitating me. So if any of my friends or family reads this, please stay away from me, whatever that thing is, it isn’t me. I’m still stuck here and if I move I’m dead.

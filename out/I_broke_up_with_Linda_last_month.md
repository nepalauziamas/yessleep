I(22M) broke up with Linda(24F) last month.

For some background, I met Linda because I have been best friends with her brother, Kent(21M), since we were five. I always had a crush on her, but I had just assumed she didn’t like me back. Well, five years ago, Linda made a move and we started dating.

She was really abusive to me and yelled a lot, especially after the miscarriage that happened a year ago. I only just recently built up the courage to break up with her. It’s been absolute heaven. I don’t have to worry about her yelling about my woodworking hobby or her obsession that me and my other female friend were in a secret relationship.

Kent was always nice to me. He would never take sides, and when Linda went to his apartment after our fights, he would comfort her in person AND me over call. Me breaking up with Linda hasn’t changed our friendship, not so far.

Kent is amazing at cooking, so I visit him often to eat at his place. When Linda moved out, because their parents died a few years ago from food poisoning(they had a bad relationship anyway, they wouldn’t have let her stay), she moved in with Kent, which made things awkward to say the least. I still visit him for food often though. Linda looks at me almost predatorily when I come over with this strange smirk on her face.

Ever since she left, I’ve been feeling really strange. My stomach hurts a lot and sometimes I can barely get out of bed. I think it’s because I’m so not used to being alone, maybe like a post-breakup depression? Is that a thing?

Anyway, that’s not the point. The point of this is Kent said something really weird the other day, and I don’t know how to respond. Here’s how it went.

So Kent was going on with his cooking ramblings one time when I was over eating. Linda was out shopping for something, thank goodness, and Kent’s two roommates were out partying.

“…so, I was wondering, should I add more spices to the taco meat? I’m still trying to perfect the taste… I don’t know. I like how the meat tastes in that roast beef we had a couple weeks at that restaurant, remember? I don’t know how to replicate it though…”

I was zooming in and out of focus, like normal, focusing on the salad & soup he had made for me, and then he said something really weird. Here we go.

“…I think Jim and Harley were good test subjects for polonium…”

And he continued as if he’d never said anything. Now, here’s why this was weird, if not terrifying: Jim and Harley were Kent and Linda’s parents. Yes, the same ones who died from food poisoning. And polonium, which I just found out a bit ago from a google search, is a slow-killing poison.

I don’t think Kent is a murderer. I mean, he’s always said I’m just paranoid about EVERYTHING, so of course I’m overreacting about this too, right?

The parents died about two months after a fight with Linda. They, like me, ate Kent’s food almost every day.

A few weeks after a fight with Linda.

Ate Kent’s food nearly every day.

Test subjects for polonium.

I’m going to cut all contact with Kent, maybe move away and change my number. I don’t know if I’m overreacting or not but I am TERRIFIED.

Should I do that? Am I just overreacting? I don’t know what to do. Please help me. My head really hurts.

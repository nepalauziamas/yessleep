Case File #00182-3

&#x200B;

*The following is a transcription of a video confession by an unknown individual who worked at the TWH Research and Development Center sent to us three weeks after the previous incident and police investigation. Due to the disturbing nature of the video, discretion is advised.*

&#x200B;

*Transcription begins.* 

&#x200B;

*…*

&#x200B;

*The video opens in a dark room with the unknown woman sitting at a table. Her face is not fully visible due to the darkness in the room. However, light is beaming in from outside one of her eyes, and her hair is visible. Her eyes are bloodshot with severe dark bags underneath, her hair appears unkempt, and her voice is visibly shaky when she speaks.* 

&#x200B;

I think I’ve sent this to the right people. One of you came in with the officers in the labs a couple of weeks back and gave your card to Dr. Reiner? The man seemed suspicious of the labs like he was looking for more than he was seeing; I saw him out of the corner of my eye pressing against walls and tapping steel workbenches. Am I assuming he was looking for some kind of a secret passage? Well, he was *very* close to finding it. Any assumptions he had were correct; there is a secret door within the facility that leads to a private lab within the TWH R&D Center. 

&#x200B;

You may be wondering how I know this? I’m one of the lab technicians who work with Dr. Reiner, but not on his publicized works at finding a cure for Alzheimer's or whatever tale he spins. The work Dr. Reiner does in the secret lab is something much more horrible,, and he needs to be stopped before anyone else gets hurt. Bryan Clarke wasn’t the first death in our facility, and he won’t be the last. It was just lucky he got the call out in time as the creature usually stikes much faster than it did. I know from first-hand experience as I’ve been one of the people tasked with looking after it for the past several months. 

&#x200B;

This *thing* is not natural, although I’m sure you’ve figured that out by now. I don’t know where it came from, how it was created or if it was even actually created in the first place. All I know is the origins of it; this is what Dr. Reiner would talk about over and over again. Many years ago, Dr. Reiner found a journal written by his Grandfather detailing his time in the second world war. Now I’ll spare you the details, but let's just say he was a scientist working for the wrong side. Dr. Reiner never met his Grandfather and was only ever told that he was a brilliant scientist. He was working to cure illnesses before the war. However, when the machine of war demanded his services, he switched to creating horrific weapons. 

&#x200B;

Dr. Reiner would talk about the instruments of death his Grandfather would write about, but one thought always haunted him. His Grandfather spoke about how he ultimately knew that his side would lose the war and that the allied forces would prove too much. However, he awoke one night after a horrific nightmare of a creature fighting on the front lines. This monstrous thing would not only kill its enemies, but it would steal their very life essence and their identity. In turn, it would use its victim’s faces on the other enemy soldiers, horrifying them and crushing their morale. The creature would then swiftly kill its enemies while stealing their very identity. 

&#x200B;

From that night on, Dr. Reiner’s grandfather spoke about finding a way to create such a monster. Once it was alive, Dr. Reiner’s Grandfather would unleash it on the allied forces, and the war would be over. There were notes in the book about horrible things such as resurrection through artificial scientific means and sewing bodies together. Near the end, there were even notes about unholy rituals to summon demons. It seemed like a bad movie, but Dr. Reiner was obsessed. This is all he thought about while working in labs all these years until he found someone to fund his bizarre experiment. TWH Inc. has been his backing ever since. 

&#x200B;

I can’t tell you how he did it. I have some theories, but I fear the reality of how this thing came to be maybe much worse. I went into the facility early one morning, and there was a chill. It was so cold I could see my breath and felt the hair on the back of my neck stand up. The feeling that came over me was unnatural. I wanted to run out of that building the second I felt what I did. God, I wish I ran out of there. Maybe things would be different? Somehow I doubt it, though. Walking into the lab, the cold feeling worsened, and that's when I saw Dr. Reiner. 

&#x200B;

He was staring into a containment room while muttering to himself. I tried to get his attention, but he didn’t look at me. I crept towards the containment room window to see what he was looking at and…

&#x200B;

*At this point in the video, the subject breaks down and quietly sobs for several minutes; she then takes a few deep breaths before continuing.* 

&#x200B;

I’m sorry, I promise it won’t happen again. When I approached the window and looked in, I saw three corpses lying on the floor. They were three other lap technicians working with Dr. Reiner. Their names were Clara, Donald, and Ethan. Their families deserve to know what happened to them; they are under the impression they’ve all been sent on a special project out of the country. Their bodies were withered and pale. Clara was the closest to the door; it seemed like she had almost gotten out. I immediately ran over to open the door when Dr. Reiner snapped out of his trance and grabbed my arm. Our eyes locked, and he gently shook his head. His eyes had a look of absolute fear in them but also something else..triumph. 

&#x200B;

Dr. Reiner led me back to the window and pointed to the corner where a bunch of equipment had been knocked over. Looking closely, I saw a hand, it was grey with long fingers, lying motionless on the floor. I looked at Dr. Reiner and was about to speak when he shook his head again. “Just observe, Doctor,” he said in such a hushed voice I almost had to ask him to repeat himself. We stood there in silence for what felt like hours; it very well may have been. Then just as I was about to try and leave, he drew my attention back to the hand as it moved. 

&#x200B;

Slowly the hand moved up to the top of a flipped-over counter as if to lift whatever body it was attached to. We watched as a body slowly lifted itself off the ground with its back to us. Its entire body was grey, and the skin was so withered, just like the bodies of my former colleagues. Soon it stood up fully but still hunched over as if its back was in pain from having to support its unnaturally tall frame. I looked over at Dr. Reiner in shock, “what the hell is that?!” I asked. Dr. Reiner ignored me and began to quietly mutter to himself again. The thing slowly turned around, and when its face came into view, I screamed and stepped back. 

&#x200B;

It… had three faces, as you’ve heard already from the reports. The three faces are stacked on top of each other in a triangular shape. It stared at us for a moment, then it slowly began to shuffle towards us. The thing moved with such difficulty, but it quickly stepped over any equipment or bodies in its way. The three faces stared at us; while it moved towards the window, Dr. Reiner kept muttering to himself, and I ran to the door. Before I got there, I heard it lock, I wanted to open it, but it wouldn’t budge. I looked back, and Dr. Reiner was standing by his desk with his hand on the lockdown control. 

&#x200B;

I didn’t understand; I just stared at him with tears running down my face. I looked back at the containment room window, and that thing was standing right in front of it, with its faces gazing at me. Dr. Reiner extended his hand towards me, gesturing me over to him. “Come, Doctor, do not be afraid of this scientific miracle! We have much work to do,” he said as he walked back to the glass window. I slowly walked up behind him as he stared at the creature on the other side of the glass. Suddenly, its faces changed. It did this several times until it landed on three faces; I recognized them as my former colleagues Clara, Donald, and Ethan. The faces stared as their mouths slowly grew into a silent scream. 

&#x200B;

With tears rolling down my face, I looked over to Dr. Reiner. “What is this?” I asked.

&#x200B;

Before responding, Dr. Reiner was silent for a second, “It is what my grandfather saw all those years ago in his nightmares, a horrible beast that will steal the very life essence from anyone it chooses…Der Endlose.”  ….The Endless One.

&#x200B;

So, we began the tests. Dr. Reiner wanted to find out what the creature could do, how many lives it could take, and how much time it would need to rest after it took a life. He…sacrificed so many people to it. Mostly it was homeless people to who he would offer food and shelter too, but after a while, he began to take volunteer test subjects from other areas of the facility, and then, recently…he started using his lab assistants. He would watch and listen to their screams as they begged for him to stop the creature…he would just stand there and take notes as the creature would shift its faces, then grab its victim and steal their life. 

&#x200B;

I don’t know how, but over time it got stronger. Before, it would need a few hours to recover after attacking someone, but eventually, it became insatiable. It would stand at the glass, all hours of the day, just staring at us as its faces shifted. Dr. Reiner tasked me with keeping watch over it during the night. “Do not take your eyes off it for one second, Doctor, not one second!” 

&#x200B;

Dr. Reiner barked with a threatening tone. I was scared that he would sacrifice me; next, I wanted to stop him…but he had resources. I knew he would be able to discredit me and ruin my reputation, or he would just kill me. I spent several months watching that…*thing* every night. 

&#x200B;

Just standing at the glass with its arms at its side, looking right at me with its shifting faces, and then it would suddenly stop on the faces of my former colleagues… and… they would scream. I couldn’t take it anymore. Yes, it’s a monster, but I could never come up with something like this, even in my worst nightmares. The faces…screaming…I think they're in pain; they can feel what has happened to them. God, I hope they can’t. I hope I’m wrong. I requested a leave of absence from the project for a week to rest and ensure I gave my all to the project. Surprisingly, Dr. Reiner was supportive of this and insisted I was crucial to the project. Hence, he wanted me in top form.  

&#x200B;

The last night I watched over the creature, it felt like a weight was being lifted off my chest. I knew my experiences watching this horrible nightmarish fiend would be over soon, at least for a little while. As I was leaving to get a cup of coffee, I turned to walk away, and suddenly I heard a loud slam on the glass behind me. The creature had its hand rested against the glass…almost like it didn’t want me to leave; its faces started shifting so quickly…I couldn’t keep up. There were so many that I began to get dizzy and lightheaded. I tried to reach my chair, but I couldn’t look away, and before I knew it, I had fallen unconscious. 

&#x200B;

I was woken up by Dr. Reiner and a security detail member; he was screaming at me about what had happened. I looked and saw the glass of the containment room was broken, with the door to the lab was opened. He told me to go home immediately after getting checked out by the medical team. I have a concussion, but that's not the worst of it. The creature got out. Bryan must have heard the bang and came to check it out, even though he was under strict orders to *never* enter this part of the building. Then he… well, you know what happened to him. 

&#x200B;

We have no idea how it got free or why it waited so long to break the glass and escape. It was almost as if it needed to build its strength and lull us into a false sense of security. Since then, it's been roaming free within the building, but we can never find it after it attacks. I don’t know where it goes and why it has not left the building entirely; it's like something is keeping it here, or maybe someone… I often think about whether it would have killed me had Bryan not come by and saved my life. Dr. Reiner has ordered me to stay home and recover, but I can’t shake that thought.

 

Every night it stalks the facility. Dr. Reiner has become obsessed with capturing it, but it never reveals itself to him. Dr. Reiner has effectively hired a small army to help him try to capture the creature. Still, they apparently haven’t had any luck. Something needs to be done before the creature has enough and leaves the facility. If it escapes…there's no telling what it will do or where it will go. It may even come here and finish what it started. Please, you have to do something. It has to be stopped before it kills another innocent life. Bryan; had a family, and he was a good man. 

&#x200B;

I’m not innocent, I’ve made peace with my own part in this, and I’m ready to face the consequences of my actions. I see the creature every time I close my eyes; I see the faces. So many faces. I haven’t had a good night's sleep in weeks, and I’m ready for the endless one to come for me. I…I want this. I need this. I yearn to be a part of it. 

&#x200B;

*The unknown individual leans forward, revealing deep cuts on her forehead and on the side of her face covered by the shadows. The cuts are bleeding; they seem to be done in a random order, but a few can be made out to be in the shape of two eyes and a mouth.* 

&#x200B;

Do you see? I’m just like it; I have too many faces! I can’t figure out how to make them change, but I’ll keep trying until I do. 

&#x200B;

*She lifts up a serrated knife and digs into the cuts on her face in an attempt to change the expression of what she believes are faces she has carved into her skin. This causes further bleeding and severe tissue damage. She begins to whisper a phrase under her breath that is not picked up by the camera's audio. After a few minutes, her face is almost entirely covered in blood.* 

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

As there was no return address on the package, the video was sent in, and authorities could not locate or identify the woman in the video. Local hospitals were checked for a Jane Doe with such injuries, but none were found. It's being assumed that the unknown woman succumbed to blood loss. No other information has been discovered about her, and TWH Inc. is not responding to any requests for follow-up interviews. 

&#x200B;

After enhancing the audio of the video, it is determined the phrase she was whispering under her breath was the following repeated over and over again: 

&#x200B;

*“I want to have too many faces; I want to be the endless one.”*

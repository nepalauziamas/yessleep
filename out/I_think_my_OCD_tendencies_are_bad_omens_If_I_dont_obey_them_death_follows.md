If it weren't for my frustratingly illogical OCD tendencies then maybe there'd be 13 less dead squirrels in the world. There might be a lot less death period.

It started on a Monday morning. I had just brushed my teeth and flipped the light switch off when that familiar sinking feeling welled up from my stomach.

It was vague and unclear, as the compulsions usually are, but something wasn't right. I hate to obey the compulsions, but I had to turn the light back on and try again. If I didn't something bad might happen.

I know it's illogical, most of the time I push it out of my head, but sometimes it's just easier to comply.

For the second time I flipped the switch off, but the weight still pulled down on me. 3 times didn't do the trick either. Neither did 4,5,or 6. I made it all the way up to 12 when I'd decided I'd had enough.

Every instinct I have told me that one more time would make things better.

I walked away on principle.

I shouldn't have played along. I had a weak moment. You don't want to feed the wrong wolf, so to speak.

Over the next 3 days I counted 13 dead squirrels on the road. You might be wondering why I was counting dead squirrels, I'll admit it is pretty strange, but the truth is, I don't have a good reason for a lot of the things that I do. Still, curious that it was 13.

The next morning I was certain that I'd left the oven on. So certain, that I went back and checked 5 times. I knew the 6th time would have made things better but I fought the warning in my gut and left anyways.

3 days went by and 6 of my coworkers didn't show up for work. They carpooled together because gas prices are so high.

According to the traffic camera the driver tried to avoid hitting a squirrel and drove head first into a semi truck.

The company gave the rest of the office the week off. I decided I wouldn't leave the house.

3 days ago I put my pants on and I couldn't help but roll my eyes as that stupid anxious feeling came over me.

Twice I put my pants on but I felt like 3 times would have made things better.

I hesitated but decided to walk away. Screw it. I'm not going to live in fear.

Right now I'm sitting in the kitchen and I can see out the window that my new neighbors are moving in. The guy must be a truck driver. He parked a semi in front of their house and him and his wife are unloading it.

I hate to potentially doom all of us but on a deeper level I think that hiding from the world is even more tragic than whatever coincidence fate might dole out.

I'm going to go introduce myself and see if they need any help.

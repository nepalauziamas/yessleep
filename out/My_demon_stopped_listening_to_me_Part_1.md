I am currently inside a church right now. I am not the most religious person in my bloodline, but the priest here said that God accepts everyone that comes to him (quite different than what my family says about God. For them he hates gay people). This is the only safe place where I can type about this. He can't enter here and I can have some spare time before the next mass will start.  
I think he finally killed somebody yesterday.  
The him I'm referring to is my demon. You might be thinking, "oh we all have our demons!?" but he's different. He's an actual demon. He's not the stereotype you see in the media, but he's practically an individual (and he can think by this own now). He is not red, he is completely pale white. He is neither muscular or a stick, he got a body of a mannequin. I can't tell his height because it's his choice whether to look slender or to copy my body. He has a glossy body. He has details that can't be easily seen because his body lacks contour. He is bald, and no hair everywhere. He has long, white nails. A long penis. Pointy shoulders. His face...  
He has this face of a normal mannequin. His eyes are half open. By observation, he scares most of the people I hate by his facial movement. The first time he presented himself to me, he was in my closet (of course he would be there). I was cornered in my bed when he decided to crawl to the top of the closet. I can hear the soft cracking of this bones (I assume he has bones) as he moves slowly. I only thought of three things back then: him, me and the open door that was just next to the closet. He was smiling at me. But his eyes look like he was about to fall asleep, and his smile looks like he intentionally pouts. His brows are the bones that contains the eyes. His eyes moved high to his forehead before he jumped at me. He did this at almost everyone that tried to ruin my life.  
"They must've known his existence!"  
No. What followed is something nasty. When he jumped at me, his limbs grew longer. I can't move when he made me lay by my stomach in my bed. He closed the door with his toes. I tried to scream, but nobody heard me. It was then when I stopped feeling my pants and my underwear, then followed an orgasm that "rewired" my brain. The same thing happened to most of the people that tried to ruin my life. The next day all of them became so nice to me. They cannot remember a thing.  
I can remember because he kept popping out of every dark place in our house (and he's from my closet). When he resurfaced under my bed, I almost jumped out of the window when I remembered the things he did to me. I can't believe I'm saying this but, after that he was so nice to me. He catched me before I can open the window and hugged me. Yup, whatever you're feeling right now I felt that too.  
I still have twenty minutes here.  
Let me compare his first victim and what happened yesterday. His first victim was my high school classmate Kent. We were seatmates for a single semester before it all changed for the better. He's the type of guy that boasts in whatever the definition of a "man" is. In our PE classes, he makes sure that he sweats in our basketball games just so he can be half-naked for the girls to see. In our Creative Non-fiction class, we constantly watch or read emotional works. He bullies his friends to cried or shed a tear. In the boys' bathroom, he peeks at his friends' penises to compare them to his. Smaller than him is a news for the class to hear (which is stupid because everyone is flaccid there). Nobody can really complain because he's the son of the guidance counselor (money moves in our school). Then there I am entering the scene. I went to the bathroom to pee when I caught up in the same act that's bound to happen again. It was him and his other three friends in the urinals when he started peeking. I was in the only available urinal beside his.   
His face when he saw mine.   
I was only half-flaccid because I really needed to pee that day. You know that feeling of being hard because of the accumulating need of peeing? Yes that. To the women, it's like an open balloon getting bigger because it's getting full of water.   
His friends already ran outside.  
"What, you feel better than me now?" He pushed me in the bathroom wall.  
"I did not say a word!" I pushed him back. All I can think of in that time is what happened to all his victims after he humiliated them. It was his victims who apologized, and the parents received money in exchange of ruining their children's high school lives. I heard all of this by eavesdropping.  
Then he punched me in my gut. I fell on the floor. He closed the door and started kicking me. I tried to fight back but I thought "I should look terrible for everyone to believe me, for someone to record me and share beyond the school premises." I let him throw a bucket of water at me. Then he arrived.  
He crawled from one of the toilets and looked at him as he froze, peeing himself again.   
For some reason, I just nodded.  
He climbed by the ceiling as he tried to open the door. He jumped at him and ripped his pants off before fucking him behind. He fell on the wet floor and I watched all of it, saw Kent's eyes turn white. The day ended with me receiving an apology from him and a brand new uniform. All because he still can't grasp the magic of the penis.  
What happened yesterday, was different. It's been a week since my summer vacation. I was invited by Jonas to their house (and basically a hacienda) along with my other old friends. It was the perfect time to catch up. When we arrived there, there were more people arriving than what was planned. Here comes the boyfriends of some of the girls that wanted to be friends with Jonas. Jonas was quite popular because of his status in life (rich and waiting for everything to be his). We were just lucky to be his classmates in junior high. The first three days went well, us classmates enjoyed trying to ride some horses and harvest mangoes under the permission of his grandmother. Their unhinged boyfriends tried playing golf while holding and finishing alcoholic drinks. On the fourth day, we climbed to a nearby mountain to build a tent and sleep for a night.   
After the sunset, we already finished setting everything. All the couples started fooling around leaving all the singles, including me and Jonas. We quickly went to a consensus that the boys need to slow down. Jonas was also too friendly and just can't stop them (this is when we come up and rescue this week). There was a hot minute when it was just both of us. We started talking about the wind and the trees before jumping to the topic of my old confession to him back then.   
"Do you remember when you told me you have a crush on me?"  
"Oh my God please let's forget that!"  
"That was brave of you."  
"Nearly ruined my school year."  
Jonas went back to their house with his uncle to get some things and it was just me in the cliff. I was covering the fire that the wind is trying to kill when one of the boys arrived out of nowhere.  
"I heard that." He said, half-drunk. I can hear his friends calling his name.  
"Heard what?" The demon was already hanging in a nearby tree.  
"You want us to leave early."  
"No. We said you and your friends need to slow down! You're the one who's mad now!?"  
"And you like Jonas."  
"It was back then! And who are you toâ€”"  
It was just a simple argument when the demon suddenly jumped on his back. I thought he's gonna fuck him, but instead he dragged him by his feet.   
"No!""  
I can hear his friends calling him and coming back to the tent when the demon dragged him to the cliff. He threw him like a stuff toy.  
I froze. I can finally feel the cold wind me and Jonas was talking about. I looked back at the tent and saw his friend shocked at what he saw. The demon vanished for the first time. I was standing alone in the cliff.  
After hours of running and the lie of being lost, I'm here at the church. Another mass is about to start and I feel like going back. I'm looking outside and there's no police cars yet. He's not afraid of sunlight and it only takes an empty street for him to appear again. This is the first time he did something against my thinking. Confronting him either ends in my death or an answer from him.  
"Father. I think my friend is already in the plaza. I really appreciate this gesture. Thank you for the night."  
"You're welcome here anytime. Please be careful."  
Now I'm stepping out of the church as I'm typing this part. I'm looking around to find a crowd to blend with. There's a group of teenagers and a street vendor that I can run to.  
Wait.  
A call.  
"Where are you?"  
"Um..."  
"Everyone is waiting here."  
"What do you mean about everyone?"  
"Us!?"  
"Is there someone hurt?"  
"Hurt? By what?"  
"Okay, I'm coming."  
I stopped the call to finish this for today. I need to go back to the mountain first.  
I'm calling a taxi right now and there's a hand waving beside me. It's a pale white hand.   
Send.

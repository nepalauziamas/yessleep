Every night I go to bed around 10:00 pm since I have to be at work by 7:00 am. This night was just the same. I got in bed and was soon out, I then woke up to a bang and quickly jumped out of bed.

I ran downstairs and saw a cup smashed onto the floor. Confused I cleaned it up and went back to bed for work in the morning. The next day I was doing paperwork, and I felt like I was being watched but every time I turned around no one was there. 

I guess one of my coworkers noticed and asked if I was alright, I jumped when I heard him do to thinking I was being watched. He calmed me down and asked me what was wrong. I just told him I had a rough night. He told me about the massage parlor he goes to saying how it would relax me.

I took his word on it and called them and we scheduled an appointment after work. When I got there and I spoke to the woman at the desk who told me where I would go. When I finally got my massage I started to relax, I then heard a whisper in my ear telling me to go home.

"What?" The massage therapist stopped "I didn't say anything" I was confused but thought maybe I was hearing things. So I let her finish and left. I felt so relaxed and got in my bed when I got home and fell asleep. I won't up and saw it was dark in my room, I couldn't move which confused me and I looked around. 

I couldn't see much with how dark it was so I tried my best to move until I saw a shadow appear in my room. It was in the corner, it swayed back and forth. I would be lying if I didn't say I was terrified by it. It started to get closer which really started to scare me and I was hoping to wake up. 

I finally got a good look at this thing and wanted to scream. It had no eyes or teeth, I only saw darkness in those areas as it reached out for me. I tried to get away but still couldn't move and when the thing finally touched me I felt the cold in its hand. I wanted to scream until it dug its nails into me.

I then got up gasping for breath and realized I was sweating hard. I thought it was all a bad dream until I felt my side where it got me I saw a mark there. I knew it was real, I couldn't go on like this so I decided to stay with my sister for a while until I cleared my head on this whole thing.

When I finally went over my niece ran up to me and gave me a big hug. "Hi uncle Mark," she said as I picked her up, my sister came "Hi Mark, come on in." When we got in she asked if I was alright, but I didn't know what to say. All I told her was I needed to clear my head and she understood.

I didn't want to say anything about the spirit thinking she wouldn't believe me. After a few days, everything seemed to be going back to normal until one day my niece asked if we could play hide and seek. I told her sure and we played. After a while of counting, I went to go find her. I checked in her room and heard her talking in her closet to someone.

I went to open the closet and realized it wouldn't open I asked her to open and she said he didn't want her to. I got more concerned and told her to open it until I heard a voice that wasn't her own. "I said no" I got scared and the closet opened as my niece came out.

I ran to my car and drove off realizing it followed me and before I left my sister came out to see what was wrong but I got the hell out. I've been staying in hotels but I have to keep leaving because it follows me. I'm currently in a hotel now, I write this hoping someone hears my story before it's too late.

I hear it coming and I'm not running anymore, I know this is the last time I wrote so goodbye everyone.

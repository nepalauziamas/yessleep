I am a fire investigator. I found a paranormal presence in a torched house and it’s following me.

You might think my job is a constant thrill ride. Others might presume I sift through cinders all day. The truth is somewhere between.

I am a fire investigator for one of the largest counties in California. Structures ignited by accident, code-related incompetence or malice need my skill set. It’s not my job to find out who did it, but to discover the cause.

I’ve been in this profession for half a decade and I have seen my share of horrific sights. I learned early on how pyromania is the least likely reason why arson occurs. A small number of people do get a sexual thrill out of it, but revenge is a far more common motive.

Years ago, I responded to the scene of a nightclub burned down by a man. He was told to leave earlier in the night by the bouncer. He came back with a canister of gasoline purchased at a convenience store a few blocks away. He spilled it all over the front stairs which happened to be the sole exit of the establishment. He threw a lit match on the fluid. Eighty people died, and a hundred and sixteen more suffered life-altering burns. The smell of their bodies, coupled with the way the smoke wafted off of their singed flesh, stays with me to this day.

A few years ago, I collected evidence in a case where an ex-cop once attempted insurance fraud. He left his home as an incendiary pile-up. The neighbor's place became a conflagration as well. The next door family’s two children screamed while carried away on gurneys. Both had third degree burns.

The most recent call I was on, though, is one which stands above the rest of them.

I responded to a report of a house leveled by a blaze. It was a single story three-bedroom in a rundown part of the city. The height of the flames gave the street luminescence. An array of police cruisers and a fire truck on the block made it resemble a war zone.

Once the firefighters had extinguished the inferno, it was time for me to get to work. The investigation started out with my typical protocol. I suited up and evaluated the area for any current safety hazards. The house was empty, rented by a single man who was at work in his job as a long-haul trucker. His shift was going to end with bad news of the worst type.

A few people in the neighborhood did step out to see what the spectacle was. No witnesses who may have seen it from the very beginning came forward at any point.

The surface level of the place was tough to trudge through and yielded nothing for me. I suspected the blaze had come from the subterranean part of the structure. I walked down into the basement. The stairs were concrete. I had the feeling this may have been a bachelor pad at one point, albeit a crude one. The space had a dirt floor. There were no visible remnants of chemical containers. I collected debris and was about to head back upstairs when something caught my eye.

Movement stirred to my left. I shifted my body in the direction of the rustling.

An elderly woman sat on a heap of ashes with globs of paint in her hands. The liquid glowed as if it was radium. The strangest part was how she had no burn marks. There was not a single strand of singed hair on her head.

“Are you injured?” I asked.

She looked at me but did not respond. I pulled out my flashlight. I got a better glance at the wall behind her. An odd yellow symbol was there, an incomplete cursive O with its left bottom half missing. There was a pronounced swish through it.

“The sign is more powerful than you,” she said. “It will control you.”

I had no weapons on me. My get up consisted of an incident report notebook, a can to contain evidence, and a set of tweezers. My toolbox with sharp objects was around the perimeter near the caution tape, out of reach to me then. She was not much of a physical threat, but her mental state left me with a feeling of indeterminable doom.

I ran up the stairs and went outside. I waved down a few Deputies.

I told them what I had seen before they scaled into the nether part of the building, along with a few paramedics.

They ascended. The Deputy approached me.

“Is she alright?” I asked.

“No one is down there,” he said.

“That can’t be. I saw her. She’s a senior citizen smeared in some kind of multi-colored paint.”

The man chuckled and said “if I were you, I’d consider getting a replacement for tonight. The stress of these kinds of calls must be getting to you.”

I bit my tongue and tried to maintain professionalism. “I’m not lying, Deputy.”

“I’m not accusing you. High-pressure situations can make us do and see things we otherwise wouldn’t. I’d take it easy, is all.”

I still finished my shift. The materials collected went to the lab for inspection. I wrote my report at the station and left for home. I walked through the door. My Labrador retriever, Demetrius, greeted me.

My apartment is a duplex on the second floor of a building which faces some sparse woodland. I opened the sliding glass screen door of my balcony to let in some cool air.

It was then I saw her. She was the same frail old woman. She hobbled towards the bottom level of my complex. On most days there was a doorman there. It was late in the night and he had gone home, so I knew the front entrance would not be accessible without a fob. That is what I told myself to stay calm, anyways.

She held a canister of gasoline, and the sound of it sloshed around with each plodding step she took. In the left she had globules of lustrous paint. The trees behind her had symbols identical to the one I had seen in the building I investigated. My instincts kicked in and I reached for my phone.

I wanted to call 911. They could send a squad car out to arrest her for some kind of criminal mischief. They could do a check to see if she was runaway from some kind of retirement home.

I reflected on my first experience with her. The authorities told me she was a mere hallucination. No one treated my account with any seriousness.

Demetrius barked.

I took a picture of her.

When I looked down again, she was gone. There was no noise. The painted symbol disappeared.

I opened up the photo, and it was of nothing but an amateur photograph of the landscape.

I stood there and stared at the topography below before I caught my breath, closed the screen, and rested on my bed.

Over the next week, I had a sudden uncontrollable urge to do something I had not done since High School. After a long shift, I drove to a grocery store and picked out a sketchpad and a set of pens. Every part of me wanted to draw. I spent every evening illustrating. It was not satisfying to me, neither my ability nor the materials used.

I found out the problem. I needed to paint. So, I purchased pastels on-line and paid extra to get them shipped to me fast. I was never a stellar artist. Like most kids, I had fleeting fantasies of one day becoming a comic book artist. Now the urge was overwhelming. The activity carried me away, and made me forget what my day job was.

I painted the O, the exact same way I had found it that fateful day. This particular illustration was perfect. I could not find a self-deprecating critique to apply to it, since it was on the canvas the way I wanted. I painted it over and over. I have yet to grow tired of it.

My phone rang. It was the station’s head of Human Resources.

“Why are you a no-call no show today at work?”

“The sign is more powerful than you,” I said. “It will control you.”

I hung up and resumed my work.

I have not showered, eaten, bathed, or completed any of my job assignments in a week. I have received a knock on my door from a landlord telling me an eviction is imminent. I do not care. These yellow signs must get finished.

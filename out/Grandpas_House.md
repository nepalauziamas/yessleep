In June of 2022 my family and I took a road trip to Missouri and then to Oklahoma to visit friends and family. We stayed at grandpa's house in OK which was very nice for the first couple of days. I slept in a room with my mom until she went to visit family in Colorado. 


My first night without her, I slept in my brother's room because I wasn't comfortable sleeping alone due to my intense fear of being watched. Which made this situation worse. But anyways, I fell asleep almost immediately with the comfort and company of my brother in the same room. 


The second night my father came to Oklahoma from a business trip to join his family on a fun filled week at grandpa's house. All was good until the pattern began. At around 2:20am I had a hot flash. I thought to myself, "Dang it, my fan is in my brother's room and he and my dad are already fast asleep". I then heard an ambulance siren or something of that sort. There was also some sort of tapping sound on an empty cabinet next to my bed. I brushed all of these concerns off and traveled to the dream realm.


On the third night, I was scrolling through social media trying to get to sleep. When 2:20am hit, I had a hot flash but I didn't forget to grab my fan before bedtime and plugged it into the nearest outlet. It didn't work. I tried the other outlet underneath it. It didn't work. I tried all of the outlets in the room and none of them worked. I then heard the siren and the tapping again but brushed them off once more. I discovered that the outlets turned off at a certain time but thought nothing of it and fell asleep.


Fourth night hit and I told my sister about it and she told me that it was strange but she'll see if she can notice it that night. This time, I left my fan running all night and even had my phone plugged in too, just in case. 2:20am hits, I have a hot flash, the fan turns off and on, off and on, off and on until I turn it off. I call my sister in because there was no way I was going to sleep after that. I couldn't hear the siren or tapping due to music blasting in my ears, but she heard the sirens. She also noticed that everybody's outlets also turned off. She's also heard a click and pounding footsteps. I'd like to point out that the ceiling fans, lights, internet, all of that didn't turn off. It was just the outlets. 


On the rest of my visit in my Grandpa's house, my mom was there so i was almost forced to go to sleep around 11pm.


I got my dad to check it out by the way, but he had no explanation for it. If someone has a theory on what might've happened, please tell me because this freaky.

Have you ever seen someone fill their cup with soda first, and *then* put the ice in?

It happened twice yesterday. I was having lunch at Wendy's, and watched in horror as a middle-aged woman went up, filled her drink to the brim with lemonade, and *then* put ice in.

She seemed shocked when the lemonade splashed all over her arm.

I continued eating my sandwich, laughing to myself. But then the same thing happened not a minute later. Her husband--a gray-haired man wearing shorts despite the cold weather--went up to the machine and filled his cup with coke. Then pressed the ice.

*Splash.*

He yelped as coke splattered all over his shirt.

*What are these people? Crazy?* I shook my head, biting back laughter. I watched as the man took a seat next to his wife and pulled out his fries.

*Let's hope he eats properly. Geez.*

But… he didn't. He plucked out a French fry, dipped it in ketchup--and stuck the *other* end in his mouth.

*Wait. What?*

I watched in horror as he repeated the process. He dipped the half-eaten fry in ketchup--the same end he'd dipped before--and then took another bite from the plain side.

His eyes met mine.

I quickly tore my gaze away, and pretended to stare at my chicken sandwich. I took a few bites, checked my email, and then got up to refill my soda. I glanced over at the man.

He was still staring at me.

I walked up to the machine, keeping my eyes locked on the soda. I filled my cup with ice first, like a normal person, and then filled it with Dr. Pepper. But the entire time, I felt him watching me.

I finally turned around and walked back to the table. As I did, my eyes fell on the wife.

She was eating her burger upside-down.

The sesame-seed top bun was pointing downwards as she brought the burger to her mouth and took a bite. And, her husband was still staring at me.

*Okay. So they eat weirdly. No big deal… right? I mean, I make peanut butter and honey sandwiches. And I've put ketchup on salad a few times.*

But I couldn’t shake the unsettled feeling in my gut. I finished eating, took my empty tray to the garbage, and dumped everything in. I glanced back--the couple was no longer looking at me, thank goodness. They were just munching away, both on the same side of the four-seater table, staring at their food.

I walked down the narrow hall to the bathroom. But as soon as I clicked the lock shut on the stall door, I heard the loud *creak* of the door opening. Then footsteps.

My heart plummeted as I saw legs under the stall door. Bare legs, despite the cold weather.

It was *him.* I was sure of it. The shorts-wearing, ice-first, weird-ketchup-application man.

"Where are you, dammit?" he shouted, his voice echoing in the bathroom.

My blood ran cold. I clamped a hand over my mouth, trying to muffle my ragged breathing. I glanced at the stall door--it looked flimsy. Flimsy enough to kick in.

Through the gap between the door and the stall, I saw a sliver of the man. Gray hair, black shirt, khaki shorts. It was undoubtedly him. He stood still--then slowly took a step.

"I know you can hear me!" he shouted.

Every muscle was paralyzed. *He's going to kill me. Or mug me. I never should have looked--never should have stared--*

The crackle of static flooded the bathroom.

"I can hear you," a voice said, through an unseen speaker.

Relief flooded me. *Oh. He's on the phone.*

"Thank goodness. Sam and I are in position. We’re going to start in one minute. Be ready.”

A horrible tearing sound filled the bathroom. With a wet splat, the skin on his legs slowly wrinkled and warped--then cascaded to the ground. Nausea leaped into my throat and I cupped a hand over my mouth, resisting the urge to vomit.

At first, I thought he’d somehow shed his skin and muscle, and just his bones were left. But, somehow, it was worse than that. So much worse.

The white, bone-like legs stepped out of the skin pooled at the floor, revealing long feet that ended in pointed black nails. The *thing* stepped towards the door, and I saw a flash of white in the gap between the door and the wall.

Then it was gone.

A split-second later, I heard the screams erupt outside. Shrieking, terrible screams that shook me to my core. I leapt out of the bathroom, and in a panic, wrenched open the window. Like a coward, I rolled out onto the grass--and ran as fast as I could, until I was in the center of town.

The next day, I saw the report on the news.

*7 WOUNDED IN FREAK ACCIDENT AT LOCAL WENDY’S*

*All injuries attributed to a small fire that broke out after the fryer malfunctioned in the kitchen. All patients are recovering well, but suffer no memory of the traumatic* [*event.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/blairdaniels)

To start this story, I want to make all the readers aware I will not be releasing the location of where this story takes place or my real name.

I come from a small town near the border of Canada, we are not known for much besides being more of a rest stop for people crossing the border. When people decide to stay they can find that we have a plentiful amount of hiking spots, and lakes to swim in even though it is suggested not to swim in them because of all of the pollution done by the local factories.

When people decide to stay at the lake, you can learn many myths about them like old local Tales Of Sea Monsters, and Native American serpent gods living in the lakes.

Like most people, I didn't believe in monsters or urban legends. I kept my views on things in science while trying to rationalize every weird occurrence that had happened to me in those waters. It all happened way back in august of last year. Me and my friends decided to go camping and spend the night on the lake. This wasn't something new to us, it is common for many younger folks to go out and party around this time due to the nice weather which we took advantage of quite frequently.

We packed basic stuff like an electric lantern, flashlights, toilet paper, beef jerky, pocket knives to carve sticks, beer, and weed. Our plan was to just have fun and pass out on the ground. This was something we did often on our weekends so there was nothing to worry about. 

When we arrived my friend which I will be calling Andrew for the sake of his privacy and my other friend Michael. Had decided to both bring survival air mattresses and laughed about how I'd be sleeping on the cold ground tonight. I shrugged them off and we began drinking, talking, and maybe oversharing some than we should of. The reason I say that is because something Michael had said pissed off Andrew which made him storm off towards the lakeside. 

I felt like since I was the only one who was sober enough to know that Andrew might be overreacting a bit and I should take initiative to bring him back to the campsite we had made.  When I began walking it took me a short amount of time to actually catch up to Andrew, which seemed a bit odd since the lake was about a 5-minute walk and he ended up leaving 10 minutes before I decided to go get him.

When i found him he was just staring off into a view of the lake. One could say he was frozen in place, aghast by what was before him. I was scared by what I was looking at when I noticed Andrew's face. His mouth and eyes were so wde, as if he was screaming but none of the words could leave his mouth. I turned my head to the waters of the lake when I could make out a skull protruding out of the water.  From what I could tell it looked like it was a bear's skull. Most likely a giant black bear. 

When I noticed It I began to shake Andrew. He snapped out of frozen stature and began to scream cry. He fell to the floor crouching onto his knees and he dug his nails into the back of his head. I began to rapidly shake him and told him we have to go, when I began to lift him his body became limp. He was refusing to let me pick him up. He kept screaming at me, I didn't understand why he wouldn't just run with me. So I turned around and tried to scream to Michael for help. When he wasn't coming I ran back to our campsite. He was sitting there nearly passed out piss drunk, I shook him and told him we had to get Andrew. 

He mumbled to me that he was fine that he just needs to blow off some steam and that he was sorry for what he had said to him. I told him, you mumbling fucking idiot there is something in the water and it has scared the living shit out of Andrew. He won't let me pick him up to bring him back to camp and I'm too scared to stay down there alone. We have to grab him. 

Michael told me that I was a lying asshole and that I should let him sleep, and I proceeded to offer him that I'd buy him a whole keg of his favorite beer if he'd just walk down to the water to get Andrew and that this isn't a joke. 

He finally got up and by the time we reached where I left Andrew, he was nowhere to be seen. That was until Michael said to me. What the fuck is that over there you need to quit this joke right now? 

That is when I noticed Andrew standing at the edge of the lake, slowly walking into it making his way to the skull that was floating in the water. I told Michael this isn't a joke and we have to get him out of there. We were too scared to get closer, and we watched as the skull began to lift into the air. That is when I realized that the skull wasn't floating, it was resting on the top of the water. A pair of tentacles lifted it up into the air followed suit by more skulls, of people and different animals that must have got trapped by whatever this creature was.

We were scream crying in hysterics for Andrew to get back here to us. 

Nothing came from our pleads. Andrew was in full focus on the creature before him. We watched as the creature wrapped its tentacles around him and slowly pull him under. We watched as we saw bubbles arise to the surface of the water, to slowly stop all together after a couple of minutes. We ran off and tried to get help. We made it to the road that we took to get to the lake, and screamed waving at ongoing cars to stop for, and that we needed help. Two officers stopped to listen to us but no one believed that our friend had been dragged into the lake by some creature. 

They told us that we were drunk, stoned and that our friend must have slipped into the lake. His passing was chalked up to an accident boats were sent out to try to find him but nothing was ever found.  Me and Michael go to that lake once a month to pay respects to our friend, Michael hasn't been the same. He blames himself for the passing of Andrew. I swear every time I go to the edge of the water on a foggy day, I can still hear the awful sounds of Andrew's screams that he let out that night, faintly under the water. Accompanied by a shadowy figure moving around in the water. 

I hope this story reaches people. I want people to be careful when going around swimming and camping by these lakes. There is something evil that lives within them. I'm not sure what, but what ever we saw that night has scarred me for the rest of my life.

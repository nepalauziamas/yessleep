"And would you like more oatmeal, honey?" My mum asked my four-year-old son, Danny, as we sat at the breakfast table.

"Yes." 

My mother started piling more oatmeal into his bowl, to which he started wailing.

"I said yes!" 

My mom gave my wife and I a confused look. 

"I'm sorry, Danny, does 'yes' mean something different in your home?" She asked.

"No, mum, we're sorry. Danny's been getting his words mixed up, we're going to take him to a speech therapist once we get home. Just last week he threw a tantrum at daycare because he said 'no' to a cookie, and was upset that all the other kids got one and he didn't." I said as my mum picked him up. 

"Well, if you say so. I'll go give Danny a bath, and then we can head out to the London Eye. Are you excited to go on the big ferris wheel, love?" My mum asked. 

"NO!" Danny excitedly exclaimed, throwing his hands into the air, and we all laughed. 

This trip was almost perfect. It was the first time my American wife and son had visited my hometown of London, and so far we were all having so much fun. The only thing to put a damper on our vacation was my son's constant mixing-up of yes and no. I should've got it checked out long ago, I know, but I guess I thought it was cute, and now I worried it was too late. My wife, Laura, seemed to think the same thing. 

"Paul, we really should make sure Danny knows yes from no. It could cause some big trouble later on. I mean, it was bad enough when he started talking in a British accent from hanging around you." She joked.

"Hey, like father like son" I shrugged, and we laughed. 

Just then, my mum returned with Danny in tow. He was holding his favourite stuffed animal, a Dalmatian plush he affectionately called "Doggie" in his hands, and he insisted on bringing it along with us to the London Eye.

"Are you sure, Danny? It could get lost." Laura warned.

"No. I'm bringing Doggie along." Danny said stubbornly. 

I shook my head, smiling, and hoisted Danny up onto my shoulders as we left my childhood home. 

It was a lovely day together. We all got to ride in a double decker bus, went on the london eye, and stopped at a nice ice-cream parlour on the way home. (Danny's favourite part.)  It was only when we were walking home when things went wrong. 

Up ahead Danny saw something up ahead, and excitedly pointed towards it.

"Mama, daddy, I want to go there!" He shouted, bouncing up and down. 

"Alright, Danny, you go ahead." Laura said. "Whatever he's pointing at can't be too special." She mumbled to me.

Laura, my mum, and I were all tired from a day of walking, and my mum and I knew the area very well, so none of us had a problem with letting Danny run a bit ahead of us as we lagged behind. 

Worst mistake of my life. 

When we finally thought we had reached the place where we thought Danny wanted to go, a small cart selling balloons, my son was nowhere to be seen.

"Danny? Danny!" We all shouted, to no avail.

After two hours of searching we called the police. 

Danny was finally marked down as missing two days later. 

I ruined my life trying to find him. 

I sold our house back in the USA and flew back to England to live with my mum so I could spend every day searching for him. I looked in every single crevice of London, every nook and cranny, to find Danny. I'd send in a new police report to the cops every week to report him missing, but after a while they blew me off. It had been too long and there was no evidence, his case was officially marked a cold case. I spent every hour of every day researching things that could've happened to him, and neglected to eat, sleep or bathe until I got answers. 

Laura  left three years after Danny went missing. She said that it was time I moved on, and we would have to separate until I could figured myself out. 

My mum died six years after that. 

I was officially alone. 

It had been nine years since my son, my beloved son, went missing under my watch. It was my fault. He would've been 13 now. 

But then, something happened that shook my world.

I was watching the news at breakfast, at the same table where Danny ate his last meal, when a new report came up.

An underground child labour ring that had taken kids and used them as slaves for nine years, right here in London.

*Nine years.*

*In London.* 

I immediately recognized where they were. It looked like they were taking all the kids out of the place they had been held hostage all these years, and I knew this was my chance to find my long lost son at last. I leapt out of the door and raced through the streets of London, and that's when I saw it. 

Boxed off by caution tape and surrounded by police vans, was an abandoned building. And outside that abandoned building, hundreds of dirty kids, shaking in fear. My son could be in there. 

I tore through the caution tape, sprinting past the police, who were chasing me now. Frantically looking around for my son, I began yelling his name.

Then something dropped at my feet. 

It looked like a lumpy dirty rag, but when I picked it up and looked under all that dirt I instantly recognized it.

It was Doggie. 

I looked up  at the boy who dropped it at my feet. 

He was about 3 feet taller and his hair was covering his eyes like a curtain, but under all that grime I knew for sure. This was Danny. 

I began to weep. 

"Oh, my boy, my boy!" I embraced him in a hug, sobbing the entire time. 

Until the police grabbed me.

"You sons of bitches let me go!" I yelled, throwing one off of me as the others pinned me to the ground.  "That's my son you're taking away from me!" 

One of the policemen bent down to Danny's level.

"Boy, do you know who that man is?"

Danny looked at me, then back at the policeman. The other police had already started handcuffing me. Danny picked Doggie back up off the ground.

"No."   
The policemen all gathered around me, grabbing me and throwing me into the back of the police van, all while I was yelling.

"You monsters! That's my son! You're taking me away from my son!"

"He's not your son, sir." One of the policemen said while buckling me into the van. 

I caught one last glimpse of Danny, who mouthed two words to me.

"Bye daddy."

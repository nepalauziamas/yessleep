"And would you like more eggs honey?" My mum asked my four-year-old son, Danny, as we sat at the breakfast table.

"Yes."

My mother started piling more eggs onto his plate, to which he started wailing.

"I said yes!"

My mom gave my wife and I a confused look.

"I'm sorry, Danny, does 'yes' mean something different in your home?" She asked.

"No, mum, we're sorry. Danny's been getting his words mixed up, we're going to take him to a speech therapist once we get home. Just last week he threw a tantrum at daycare because he said 'no' to a cookie, and was upset that all the other kids got one and he didn't." I said as my mum picked him up.

"Well, if you say so. I'll go give Danny a bath, and then we can head out to the London Eye. Are you excited to go on the big ferris wheel, love?" My mum asked.

"NO!" Danny excitedly exclaimed, throwing his hands into the air, and we all laughed.

This trip was almost perfect. It was the first time my American wife and son had visited my hometown of London, and so far we were all having so much fun. The only thing to put a damper on our vacation was my son's constant mixing-up of yes and no. I should've got it checked out long ago, I know, but I guess I thought it was cute, and now I worried it was too late. My wife, Laura, seemed to think the same thing.

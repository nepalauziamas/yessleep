I’m a single dad with a son and last week he found the most terrifying and disturbing thing imaginable inside of my house and both of us can’t stop thinking about it. 

The weekend was normal I picked my son up from school on Friday and we went on a bike ride then played rocket league. I put him to bed and 10 minutes later my son was awake. My son has always had sleep issues he’s got adhd and can’t fall asleep for hours most nights and I usually will end up finding him just roaming around my house cause he can’t sleep. I heard him walking around and was to tired to get up, I decided to give it 5 more minutes until I get out of bed to put him back in bed. Two minutes past and a hear him walk down to the basement I knew he would somehow get into trouble down there since I have my tools and there were tons on nails lying around. He knows he’s not allowed down there but he thought I was asleep and figured he would check it out. I ran over there Bedford he could step on any nails or get hurt any other way. I found him next to the wall trying to open something I just picked him up and put him back into bed. 

About 30 minutes later he got back up at first I did not hear him but when he walked past my room to get to the basement I woke up. At first I did not really know if I heard him or not so I just tried to go back to sleep. A few minutes later I heard a thud downstairs and I knew he was up. I slowly got out of bed and started to head towards my basement when I heard him scream it was not a normal scream it was a horrific scream like he just saw a ghost I ran thinking he had stepped on a nail but it was much worse.

I got to the basement and my son was running up the stairs I asked him what happened and he said there was a dead person. I did not know what to expect and I told him to show me what he saw and there it was… behind some old boxes a cut out in the wall. In this wall was a freakin hand, a actual one. Just the wrist down. It was at most a year old and behind it were bones. WTF. Just writing this all is giving me the shivers. I bought his house just 3 months ago since I had finally saved up enough for my first house. I called the cops and my son being the energetic kid he is refused to sleep he wanted to see what the police would do. They came and now there’s a investigation on how did it and who this hand belongs to. I wanna sell the house my son is leaving tonight and I don’t know if I can sleep here alone. Last night my son was up the whole time and had to sleep with my cause he is so scared but I am to. 

I really wanna figure out what happened just to have some reassurance of the whole situation. My whole basement is all closed off now as a open crime scene. Life is crazy.

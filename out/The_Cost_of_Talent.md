I smiled as I saw the frantic man come shakily towards me across the bar. I had expected this. I had sold him precisely what he'd asked for, but not necessarily what he'd wanted. It served him right, though, I thought as I took another sip from my drink.

The man, this Mr. Sereph, had clearly been tricking people for a long time.

It was high time he had a taste.

Sereph slammed his hands on the table, and the heads that turned quickly turned away again.

This was none of their concern, and they didn't want to get involved with this wild and unstable fellow.

"What did you do?" He whispered harshly, "What in the hell did you do?"

"Sold you my Talent." I said, taking another leisurely sip from my glass, "It was what you wanted, wasn't it?"

I tried to keep the smile from my mouth as I said it but failed miserably.

It was just too funny, after all.

Libras Talent had contacted me in the usual way. They had seen some of my work online, a burgeoning crime novel about a serial killer and his murder spree. Though it was coming along nicely, it was really more of a hobby. I had things I was passionate about, a career I was striving to advance in, and writing was more of a stress reliever. I would eventually finish it, but it seemed that Libras Talent and the ever-smiling Mr. Sereph didn't want to wait anymore.

The email had offered me compensation for his "Talent." The sum was fair, and I was tempted to take this Mr. Sereph up on his generous offer. I was no fool, though. I knew enough to do research, and the research was what made me curious about this Mr. Sereph and his Libras Talent.

A quick Google search showed me many positive reviews for the company, many squibs about philanthropy and charity, but very little about what they actually did. Sure they were generous, but what did they produce with that "Talent?" They had no books, no magazine, nothing but a simple website that proclaimed them as a Talent agency, always with that word in capital.

Talent.

That seemed to be what they peddled at the end of the day, and business seemed pretty good.

Good enough to travel from town to town and find people willing to sell their Talent, only to disappear in the night again once their business was done.

I'd learned that little fact on a small subreddit, and that was also where I had met a stranger who had information that turned out to be very important. He called himself Fallen\_Libras, and he had many things to say about Libras Talent and Mr. Sereph. He claimed that Mr. Sereph had bought his Talent, and when it was sold, he had lost his ability to write. It had taken him months to be able to write more than simple emails. His story, his ideas, his Talent, they had all been sold to someone else. That someone had used them to expand his small fortune and left Fallen\_Libras with a small check and a sense of emptiness that no money could take away.

That had given me an idea, an idea I had set into motion with my return email.

I had arrived at Libras Talent and was greeted by a stark waiting room and a smiling woman whose eyes were just a little too bright as she told me to go ahead to the back.

"Mr. Sereph is waiting for you."

I had smiled at that.

I doubted they were expecting the Talent that I was bringing.

Mr. Sereph was at his desk. His smile was wide and bright enough to fall into. I was honestly surprised that his head didn't simply separate in the middle and slide off. On his stark desk sat a fountain pen in a holder and an old-looking book. This was really what I was really there to see. Not this grinning corpse or his fancy pen, but this silently breathing book that sat closed before me.

"Mr. Griggs," Mr. Sereph said, his predatory eyes following me as I took a seat, "I am so glad that you decided to take us up on our generous offer."

That was the moment that I realized that I might be in over my head. I was a fox who had suddenly realized how big the bear was and that I might not be as clever as I thought. For better or worse, though, I was in the trap now. I could only win or lose from here, and I intended not to be another victim of this smiling man.

"I assume you have looked over our offer?" he asked, those eyes still intent on him.

"Sounds a little too good to be true," I said, feigning disbelief.

"Well, that's the benefit of working with a company like ours," Mr. Sereph said silkily.

I asked him about what he wanted, what he meant by Talent exactly, and Mr. Sereph assured me that it was all quite common.

"We buy the Talents of those who may not be utilizing them to their fullest. Your writing shows great promise, but it's clear that it isn't something you value. Sell us your Talent, and we will compensate you for it. It's as simple as that."

I shrugged and asked how this was to proceed?

Mr. Sereph opened that hungry book and handed me the pen from the little holder.

I took it, looking down questioningly at the book.

"What do I do?" I asked, still not quite sure how this worked.

"Just let your hands do their work." Mr. Sereph said.

From the time the pen touched the paper, I was writing. The ink was red, blood red, and it filled the page with the darkness that dwelt within me. Every grizzly murder, every bloody scene, every pain-filled cry, and every feeling of dread were perfectly conveyed with gruesome clarity. I wrote until my hand burned, until my fingers cramped, and as my shoulder went numb, I just kept my focus on that wide shark's grin my adversary wore.

As the ink began to spill from the book in torrents, the sea of blood rising, I felt my vision beginning to blur.

As my legs became wet with the efforts of my hand, I let my own look of exquisite rapture match that of Mr. Serephs.

When I woke up in my bed, a check on the nightstand, and a feeling of relief within me, I sighed in contentment.

It was over for me, but it was only beginning for Mr. Sereph.

And now, here he was. This ancient engine of destruction was looking for answers to a question that had only just arisen. He wanted to know why three writers, writers who had, I assumed, bought my Talent, had murdered their families? He wanted to know why one of the most prolific crime writers of the age had decided to kill his wife, his kids, and his grandchildren as they visited him for the weekend? Mr. Sereph was angry, he was embarrassed, and now he wanted answers.

I suppose I owed him that much.

"Sit," I said, smiling again at the irony.

Mr. Sereph sat, a vein throbbing in his temple.

"You see, when you bought my Talent, you believed all you were getting was my writing talent. My writing talent is okay, but my true Talent lies in darker places than you ever guessed. I write what I know, Mr. Sereph, and what I know is murder. Every one of my crimes is something I had written about in my short stories. Every cut, every gasp, every spray of blood was something I had created."

As I spoke, Mr. Sereph's eyes grew wider and more concerned.

"It was great fun, but it couldn't go on forever. The older you get, Mr. Sereph, the harder it is to maintain that level of brutality. Despite knowing better, murder is often like a mania. You can't stop it. You can only appease it for a time. So," I said, grinning like a fool, "I gave it to you. "

Mr. Sereph was speechless, "Have you any idea what you've done?"

I sipped at my drink and fixed him with a decidedly toothy grin, "Beaten you at your own game and gotten myself a reprieve from something that would likely have landed me in prison. A real win-win for me."

For just a moment, I saw what lay beneath the surface. A flash, the barest glimpse, but it was enough to let me see the blistery old devil who lay below the flesh mask. Mr. Sereph had lost his cool for a fraction of a second, and I realized I had won a victory over more than just some dusty old warlock or talented spook.

I had beaten a creature who'd been young when my grandsire was first pulling itself from the primordial ooze.

"Well played, Mr. Griggs." Mr. Sereph said, rising to leave, "I'm sure this won't be our last encounter."

As he left, I drank off my beer in triumph.

I certainly hoped not.

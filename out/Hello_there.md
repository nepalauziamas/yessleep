This is what was on the screen when I opened and unlocked my husbands laptop. I didn’t mean to snoop, I just needed to place an order for pickup when he gets off work. He doesn’t like to grocery shop..

He responded, “LFWT”. 


I’m 7 months pregnant, on bed rest per doctors order. 
Why would he need to “LFWT” my stuff? He has an in home security system that goes straight to his phone.. He also manages our cellular plan, and my location is always on. 

He must be worried about my safety, he’s always been so considerate. Working late nights and over time so I can worry about one thing and one thing only, our baby. 

I love my husband. 

He’s going to be an amazing father💙

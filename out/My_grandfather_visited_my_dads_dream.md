I recently discovered this sub and I wanted to share this incident that happened to my dad.


I generally don't believe in these spirits or ghosts stories until I've seen or felt it personally.
If someone else would've told me this, I wouldn't believe it either. But this happened to my dad and the latter events prove it was real.


So this happened back in September 2021. Where I come from, when someone dies, after their funeral within a few years you organize a 7 day ritual which is supposed to rest their spirit in peace. 

My grandfather met with a really bad accident in 2013 and was living with us since. In 2015, my parents took him back to his house in native place (which is like an 18 hour drive from where we lived) because he knew his time has come and wanted to spend the rest of his life there. My parents were also living with him to take care of him and then in December of that year he passed away.

Since 2016, my 2 sisters and me, we all had the crucial time of our life, one was supposed to marry, one was supposed to go out of the country for studies and I was in the middle of my undergrad. Mom and dad never got the time to do that ritual and put it on hold.

Now when we were all gone and had our lives sorted, my parents thought its a good time to do the ritual now.
So they went to my grandfather's house and lived there, preparing for the ritual. The ritual should include all the extended family of my grandfather, and this is for 7 days.
You can imagine the expense needed as he had 8 children and each child had an average of 5 children, and my parents were sorting that out over there, they were able to manage the predicted amount.


Now this is where it gets creepy-

One night, when my dad was sleeping, grandpa visited his dream and said, "dont worry, we have money" thats it and thats the end of the dream. My dad confused and he ignored his dream saying, "oh I was sleeping in his house, probably the memories of him".
Next night, it happened again and my dad freaked out, he told my mom. My mom didn't believe him at first.
The next night, it happened again and my dad asked him, "where is the money?" But the dream ended.
My mom and dad were freaking out but didn't know what to do, and they wanted to just get out but the ritual was still supposed to be done.
4th night, he again visited my dad's dream and this time my dad asked his question multiple times, "where is the money youre talking about? Where is it"

To which he replied, "go to the right of this room, there is another room with wooden door, go into the room, turn right and go to the corner, dig the place and I've kept the money in an iron box"

(For context - houses in my native place which is quite rural has like these specific rooms which are just used for storage and dont have a concrete floor, its hardened mud and just some tiles on top of it)


My dad freaked out and he woke up and immediately told my mom. She didn't believe it and said we'll check it tomorrow morning.

Guess what? They did all that stuff and found the money my grandpa was talking about. Like literally after digging it and finding an iron box wrapped in a plastic bag, money lets say equivalent to $10,000 (the ritual costs approximately $30,000)


My parents weren't able to comprehend what had happened and what was happening. They realized my grandfather would've put this money back in 2013 before the accident, because after that my parents were always with him and he was too weak to dig that stuff by himself after the accident.

Me and my sisters got to know about this in april this year and we weren't able to believe it. We seriously thought they were joking and they were like, "why would we go and dig out a random place in a random room out of nowhere?"


This incident is when I started firmly believing that something like this does exist. Even if we can't or won't experience, it DOES happen.

The costume I was forced to wear as mascot for Derby's Fun Land was not built for warm weather or user comfort.  I was sweating profusely as I stood outside in the noonday sun, a silent prisoner in my oversized getup as I put on a fake happy voice, dancing and capering with visitors.  All the while, dying inside.  

This wasn't what I'd pictured when I'd decided to become a character actor.

The costume had the oversized head of a cartoon dog whose gaping mouth I peered out from within.  The character wore a blue sailor outfit, a blatant rip-off of a popular duck character created by another brand - a fact which I was heckled for constantly.

"Hey, Derby!  Duck!" a little kid yelled, tossing his hot dog at me and staining my costume yellow with mustard across the front.

It was the third time that morning I'd been assaulted by a child, which was my cue to take a smoke break.  I began stomping away when someone called after me angrily.

"Hey, asshole!  My kid wanted a show, where do you think you're going?"

I turned around and saw a red-faced man with a large camera strapped around his neck, wearing a fanny pack and an Ed Hardy shirt.  The devil-child’s father, I presumed.

"Whoops," I said, gritting my teeth and looking down at the obnoxious twerp who'd just branded me with mustard.  "How do you Derby-do, little fella?  Are you havin' a great day at Derby's Fun Land?"

The kid leered up at me, grinning a gap-toothed bully's smile.

"You wrecked my Derby Dog!  Now I want a new one!  No!  I want an ice cream cone!"

The little snot knew damn well what he'd done.  His dad hadn't seen it, but the two of us knew that he'd purposefully ruined my costume with his hot dog, and was now blaming me for it.

It was too much for me to handle.  Maybe it was the heat.  Maybe it was the fact that I hadn't eaten breakfast yet.  Or maybe it was just the infuriating grin of that punk kid staring up at me, knowing he could get away with murder.  

"I think you're remembering that wrong, little friend.  You threw your hotdog at Derby."

"Hey!  My kid wouldn't do that!  Don't blame him for your clumsy ass!" 

The little boy took a cue from his father and started crying crocodile tears.  

"Derby's a big fat liar!  He wrecked my hotdog!"

A moment later the guy was attacking me, shoving me until eventually my manager had to come over - his face a frustrating mask of calm.

"What seems to be the problem here?"

"This punk ruined my kid's lunch, and now he's trying to blame him for it!  I should sue you guys!"

Sure, sue me for a hotdog, I thought in my head.  Thankfully it had gone too far by this point and I knew better than to say it out loud.  

"I'm terribly sorry, sir.  Please, follow me this way.  Let me take you to our VIP lounge and we'll get you and your son some complimentary refreshments.  Looks like you need a refill there, too!"

He pointed at the dad's red plastic cup of beer, nearly empty.  The guy finished it off in one long swig and tossed the cup at a nearby trash can, missing completely.  

"Damn straight.  C’mon Skylar, we’re VIPs," he slurred, before burping loudly.

I'd seen this before.  Some people tried to make a stink about everything, just to get free stuff.  But this douchebag was taking it to another level.  Even the kid seemed to be in on it.  And they were gonna reward this behaviour?  

Hell no.    

I'd never even heard of the Derby's Fun Land visitor VIP lounge.  But it sounded bad-ass.  And this guy didn’t deserve whatever pampering he was about to get.  I was picturing champagne and caviar, cigars and high-quality porno magazines.  

My boss looked over his shoulder at me with a glare that said he'd talk to me later, then escorted the two away into a secret door hidden behind a fake tree prop.

I followed them, thinking I would give my boss a piece of my mind.  If he fired me, so be it.  I’d taken enough abuse.

The dark tunnel behind the fake tree was long and lined with ancient brick.  It appeared to be as old as the park itself.  Far up ahead I could hear the echoing voices of the man and his bratty kid, talking over my manager as he apologized.  I hustled along to catch up with them.

But then the sounds of them talking abruptly stopped.  It was replaced by a meaty wallopping noise, like someone tenderizing meat - except they'd forgotten to remove the bone first. 

As I walked quietly through the dark tunnel, the sounds of hammering eventually stopped and were replaced by a different noise.  It sounded like something heavy being dragged slowly over the cobblestones.  Slow and deliberate.

Terrified now for reasons I wasn’t sure of, I kept my footsteps as quiet as I could, peeking around the corner.  

My manager was up ahead with another person and they were dragging two dead bodies along, one large, one small, and leaving blood trails behind them like giant, wounded slugs.  

No.  That’s not possible.  I must be seeing things.  That can’t be right, I told myself.  

A door opened and closed and they dragged the bodies inside.  I hurried along, careful not to step in the bloody trails which had been left on the stone.  When I finally came to the door at the end, I looked at the writing on the sign with stunned disbelief.  

Derby's Fun Land - In-House Hotdog Production Facility - it read.  

Authorized personnel only

I pushed open the door and snuck inside.  The room was dark and the sounds of a machine running could be heard nearby.  My heart pounding in my chest, feeling sick and light-headed, I crept towards those sounds.  What I saw in that back room I will never forget.  

My manager dropped off the two bodies and walked right past me, out the door we had come in through.  He didn’t see me in the shadows, as I watched what happened next.  

A huge man in a white butcher’s apron was sharpening a cleaver.  He was at least seven feet tall, his belly large and hanging over his belt.  

He picked up the limp body of the dead father like he was a beef tenderloin, not even straining as he set him on the workbench in front of him.  Blood poured out of his head, staining the surface red.  Then he took the cleaver and began to chop, cutting him up into usable pieces.   

Each piece, he stuck into a massive red machine that looked like it was from another century.  A giant, diesel-belching automated meat grinder which took the hands, legs, arms, and pieces of torso he fed into it and turned them into ground hamburger meat.  

I had no choice but to stay and listen to the sounds and to breathe in the coppery smells of that horrible room as he worked, first cutting up the father, then moving onto the son.  If I left, I knew my boss would see me running out the back tunnel, and who knew what he would do if that happened.  This dark secret of Derby’s Fun Land was not meant for my eyes.  

As soon as I thought it was safe, I bolted out of there, being careful not to let the butcher see me.  

When I got back to the break room I collapsed on the couch.  I needed to get out of there, to tell someone, but first I needed to rest for a moment, to process what I’d just witnessed.  

But before I could even begin to think, the door burst open.  My manager and several coworkers came in.  They all had their mouths full and were chewing, holding hot dogs.  And my boss was carrying a tray loaded with the park’s signature Derby Dogs.  

“Hey, sorry about earlier, buddy.  But, guess what!?  It’s Employee Appreciation Day!  Free Derby Dogs for everybody!  Eat up!”

What could I say?  Even terrified as I was, I'd forgotten to bring lunch and they smelled delicious.

I picked up a dog and took a bite, then spoke with my mouth full.

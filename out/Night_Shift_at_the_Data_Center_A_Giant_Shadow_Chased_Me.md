I’m back bitches, and do I have a story to tell you, I survived the fucking Shadow realm. 

Last time I posted, we learned a little about [Louis](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xlx8wh/night_shift_at_the_data_center_the_security_guard/). 

About a month ago, I went into my next shift like normal, and unfortunately, nothing happened. Tom didn’t return, no entities in sight, and no issues with the devices. I avoided the elevator, since I really didn’t want to deal with that alone. 

Then Thursday came along, that’s where everything went to hell. Jonah and Louis were sitting in the office, waiting for me, and Jonah told me that he was going to stay overnight with me and Louis, since he was worried about Tom. 

According to Louis, no one that he knows has been in the Shadows as long as Tom has. He even brought some journals from various family members that served before him. 

We waited a couple of hours, hoping something would come around or one of the sigils would be used. 

Around 8pm, we heard laughing. 

We all turned to the window and saw the big mouthed entity standing there, laughing. When he got our attention, he stopped and pointed at me.

Louis looked over and said sternly, “You need to go, I think it needs you.”

“There is no way I am going out there alone.” I responded as I started stepping away from my desk.

Jonah spoke up, “John, you might not know this yet, but Louis tends to have a good sense of direction when it comes to these things, maybe it can help us with Tom.”

I was not going to stand there and argue all night when maybe this could save Tom, so I hesitantly started walking to the door.

As I left the office, the entity started walking to the elevator, and without pressing any buttons, the elevator doors opened. It pointed to it, gesturing for me to go inside.

I looked back to Jonah and Louis, hoping for some sort of comfort, but neither of them could give me a reassuring look. I marched on, hoping that I am making the right choice.

As soon as I stepped inside the elevator, I felt my temperature drop. Almost like going from a hot kitchen into the walk-in freezer. Next thing I know, the elevator lights start flickering and the doors close. 

The lights shut off, then quickly came back on. The doors were opened, but there was a forest on the other side. This forest looked like someone took a photo of a forest but put it in the grayscale, except the grass. The grass was brown and lifeless. 

I noticed on a nearby tree was a carving of one of the protection sigils that Louis put up. I decided to start walking in that direction.

I only walked for what felt like five minutes when I found Tom. He looked fine enough, a little rough, but alive.

“Holy shit, what the fuck are you doing here, John?” Tom said, shocked. 

“Well, that one fucking entity that likes laughing sent me, but I think I’m here to help?” I replied with a shrug.

Tom looked at me with a confused, but grateful, smile. “Let’s get the fuck out of here.”

He started off in a direction, occasionally looking down at a compass. 

“So is that kind of like a magical compass or some shit?” I asked, curiously. 

“No, I just figured that heading North usually leads me to the exit.” He responded quickly. 

Before I was about to respond, we heard the sound of trees snapping. Not just branches being broken, but full trees. 

I made the mistake of looking behind us. 

I only got a decent look at it, it was a giant being. Not like an elephant giant, but more of a cosmic horror. Except, it was like a shadow of one. There weren't any markings or any sort of distinguishable features on its skin, just darkness. It had an almost humanoid silhouette, except it was bent over on all fours with a crooked back and multiple tentacles spawning from its back. 

Eventually, I realized I was running away from it while still maintaining eye (face?) contact. 

Then I ran into something. 

I woke up in a cave, or more of a carved out hill. It wasn’t human or entity made, it looked almost natural. Tom was nearby, keeping an eye outside.

“Welcome back to the land of the living, or I guess, it’s more like the land of the shadows. I managed to carry you to this cave, and hid out in this cave until that thing left. By the way, usually you want to face the direction you run in, so you don’t run face-first into a tree.” He said, matter-of-factly. 

“Great, I will remember that next time I am chased by Cthulhu’s cousin. How long have I been out?” 

“It’s been around an hour, I think? Time moves differently here. Last time I was here, for you guys it was a week, for me, about a few hours.”

“Oh shit, well, at least I hope I get overtime for this.”

“Yeah, Jonah will actually approve it, considering he will just claim we were short-staffed or some bullshit excuse to corporate. They can’t really argue, since without us, the data center wouldn’t function.” 

He almost sounded proud of saying that.  

“Well,” I started saying as I stood up, “I’m still alive and mostly functional, let’s get out of here.”

Tom took one last peek, nodded to me, and we left the cave. 

A couple of hours passed, and we found a door. Not elevator doors, but a regular office door. 

We opened it, and we found ourselves back at the data center, but we were in the hallway near the restrooms. As we walk out of the hallway towards the office, I see that Matt was at his desk, nose deep in some book. 

Like the asshole I am, I snuck up to the door and started banging on it. 

Matt proceeded to throw his book into the tiled ceiling and fell out of his chair. 

Honestly, after the night I had, I think it was somewhat justified to have a good laugh. Tom even started chuckling before Matt realized it was us. 

“Oh my God, it’s great to see you guys! How was your vacation?” Matt said, excitedly. 

I started to say something, but Tom cut me off. “Yeah, it was great, we got to see the mountains and valleys.”

“That’s awesome, maybe next time you guys can invite me, I love camping.” He smiled, as he searched for his book.   

We ended up staying a little longer just to rest, before we called Jonah, and let him know that we’re back. Tom explained to me later that the cover story will always be some sort of camping trip, he actually cares about Matt’s sanity, so he is trying to just avoid the whole issue. 

Honestly, I am not sure how someone could go camping for a month, but I guess it’s good enough for Matt. 

It’s good to be back, even if it was only for a day. I’m not sure on the terminology just yet, but it’s been a long time, so stay safe my friends. I’m going to take a nap.

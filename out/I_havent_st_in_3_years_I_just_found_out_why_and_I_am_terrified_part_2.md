Pooping is not like riding a bicycle, ***you can forget how to do it***, it's been over a month since I made my first poop, and I still haven't got the hang of it. Maybe the muscles were just weak from not using them for so long. I don’t know, but whatever it was, it made things really hard for me, not literally, just the situation. I suppose my bowel movements should be the least of my worries right now, with the way my life has gone down the shitter, no pun intended.  

After I flushed that thing down the toilet everything changed, starting with Sarah, she was acting strange. At first, it was small things like, questioning me anytime I left the room or waiting outside the bathroom for me. To be honest I did bring it on myself, I was acting fairly suspicious, especially when it came to my toilet habits, before that night I spent barely anytime in the bathroom, now I could spend hours in there trying to poop.  

Then there was the creature, I was always afraid Sarah would hear him moving around in the pipes, especially at night when he was most active. So, I spent a lot of sleepless nights trying to flush him out of there, I flushed every kind of poison I could think of down that toilet but the only thing he reacted to, was the poops. It was weird, almost like he knew before I did when I needed to go, I could hear him jumping around in the pipes like a dog before a walk, with the first rumble of my stomach. 

When the poison failed to show any results, I started taping the seat down before bed, just in case he decided to sneak back to, you know where, while I slept. I even asked Sarah to use a potty for a while, I told her there was rats in the pipes, to put it nicely she refused because, *she is not a two-year-old* and because apparently I was acting like one, I slept on the couch for a week. 

If it wasn’t bad enough with Sarah acting so weird, my mom was even worse, she kept on calling to us with these health shakes as she called them. I don’t know what was in them, but they did not smell healthy, and they certainly did not taste healthy, it tasted like vomit, but they did help with my bowel movements, they ran straight through me.  

She even started to bond with Sarah, which was odd, she always hated her, the last time we broke up she wanted to throw a party to celebrate. Ok, maybe that was a slight exaggeration, but she was really happy about it. Now they were besties as *they* liked to call themselves. 

She even got Sarah into the same health kick she was on, and Sarah started buying all these disgusting foods online to boost her immune system or some bullshit like that. I tried to tell her it was a con and not to waste money on them, but it only got me another week on the couch. 

About 2 weeks ago things took a turn for the worst, that thing got big, too big, I could hear it struggle to move around in the pipes, I knew it was only a matter of time before it wanted out. One night I heard a loud crash coming from the bathroom, I knew straight away what it was. Unfortunately, it caused so much noise it woke Sarah and she followed me to see what all the commotion was. With all the time I had been spending in there, she thought I was hiding something, I suppose she was right, in a way.   

I tried to talk her out of it, but she wouldn’t listen. luckily, I saw water coming out from underneath the door, and used that as an excuse to get rid of her by sending her to get a mop. The second she left, I went straight in there, without even thinking of the dangers and locked the door behind me. Which I regretted instantly, but it was too late by then Sarah was outside banging on the door, she was so pissed when I wouldn’t let her in. 

When I realized where I was, I cautiously searched for the creature, but there was no sign of that thing anywhere, which was a big relief I must admit. The toilet was broken clean down the middle and water was everywhere, so I got some towels from under the sink, and shouted out for Sarah to look for an emergency plumber on her phone. When I was finished putting down the towels, I went looking for a plumber myself, like Sarah politely suggested.   

Suddenly I heard a scream, then a bang, when I opened the door Sarah was lying on the floor unconscious and there was a slimy trail coming down the hallway that finished at her, well you know. I didn’t know what to do so I picked her up and took her to the car, then headed for my mom's house, which in hindsight was a bad idea, but what can you do. 

As I was driving over there, I tried to go over what I was going to say to Sarah when she woke up, but the truth is, there was no way of explaining it that would even remotely help my case, “Sarah a human lizard baby somehow got up my ass years ago. I finally got it out of there a few weeks back, and flushed it down the toilet, but it came back, and I think it found a new home.”  

There would have been no upside for me, if she didn’t believe me, she would think I was a complete psychopath, and if she did believe me, she would have thought I was a monster for letting that thing get anywhere near her in the first place.  

When I got to my mom's house I let myself in and put Sarah to bed in my old room. Then I went downstairs to get a glass of water, I got a fright when I turned on the light in the kitchen; my mom was sitting in the darkness staring into space. 

“Mom, mom, are you ok?” I said in a panic. 

She stared straight through me, “Mommy's just thinking,” she replied in a spaced-out tone. 

I pulled out a chair, sat down in front of her, grabbed her hand, “Mom what's wrong? 

Suddenly she snapped out of it, “what are you doing here at this time of night son, is everything ok?” 

I knew she had something on her mind that she was worried about and if I was a good son, I would have asked more questions, but I was expecting Sarah to wake at any moment, and still had no idea what to say to her.  

I felt like I had no choice but to tell her the truth about everything, she would have found out anyways when Sarah woke up. I expected my mom to freak out as soon as I started talking, that’s the kind of person she was, but she stayed surprisingly calm, and didn’t interrupt me once the whole time. 

For a moment I thought she was waiting for me to be done, before she unloaded on me, but she didn’t. After a long pause she stood up, took a deep breath, walked out the door, before shouting, “come on then, this is not going to sort itself out” and we went up to Sarah. She was still unconscious, but was starting to stir.  

I thought my mom was in shock she didn’t say anything she just stared at Sarah with a weird look in her eye, then blurted out, “I know exactly what to do, quick son go to the garage get some old sheets and a bucket of water.” 

Without thinking I did what she said. First, I got a bucket from the shed out back and filled it with water from the kitchen sink, it took a while because I tried to get the water to the right temperature for Sarah. Before I got to the garage, I heard a scream coming from upstairs, so I ran up there as fast as I could. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes my mom had a bag over Sarahs head, and she was tying her arms to the bed. I was just about to ask her what the fuck she was doing, when she jumped up and put her hand up to my mouth before dragging me out of there.  

When we got outside, she whispered in my ear, “look son she can’t blame you for this, I will keep her here for a few days and make it look like she was kidnapped, and they put that inside of her.” 

I couldn’t believe what was happening, my mom had completely lost the plot, and what’s worse she dragged me into it. Before I realized what was happening, she rushed me down the stairs, out the front door, and said, “go home quick son, and pretend you were never here; I will take care of her.” The weird thing was she didn’t even look nervous she was surprisingly comfortable, like she had done that before.  

I don’t know why, maybe it was shock, or maybe it was just easier to have someone else deal with my problems for me, but I did exactly what she said. As I was getting into the car, she came running down the driveway after me and whispered, “don’t speak of this to anyone, I mean anyone,” before kissing me on the cheek and running back inside. Looking back, I should have done or said something at that point, but I didn’t, I just got in my car and headed for home.  

When I got there, I went straight to bed, but I couldn’t sleep I just stared at the ceiling until dawn, I then got up and began cleaning the bathroom. As I was mopping the hallway, I took a closer look at the trail the creature left and realized there was actually two trails, going side by side, when I followed it one was leading to the spare bedroom, the other was going up the wall. When I looked in I saw something run under the bed, so I slammed the door shut. 

Then I realized Sarah might not have even seen that creature, it looked like she slipped and banged her head against the wall. I thought maybe I was worrying for nothing.  

Then my mom's words popped into my head, “I will take care of her,” I began to wonder what she meant by that. I tried ringing her to find out, but there was no answer, so I just drove over there instead. 

As soon as I walked in the door, she gave me a big smile, “well hello son, what are you doing up at this hour?” 

“Never mind that mom, where is Sarah?” I said frantically. 

She smirked, “why son, did she not stay at home last night?” then winked. 

“Please mom I'm serious, I don’t think that creature is inside her after all.” 

“I am sorry son I have no idea what you are talking about,” she said before walking away humming to herself. 

"Mom please, is she still upstairs?” 

“I don’t think so, but your welcome to check” 

When I got to my room, there was no Sarah, so I searched the rest of the house, but there was no sign of her ever been there, the sheets were changed, and the floors were washed. I tried and tried to get it out of her, but she wouldn’t tell me anything, she acted like nothing happened the night before.  

She stressed me out so much that I couldn’t stay there any longer, but before I left, I begged her to make sure Sarah would be ok. The only thing she said was, “I don’t think that’s up to me now, is it” before laughing hysterically. 

I was so worried about Sarah that I thought about going to the police, but they would have searched my house and found the creature, then blame me for Sarahs disappearance. So, I waited to see what would happen. In the meantime, I spent my days trying to get rid of that thing in the spare room; I set all kinds of traps for it, but it was too smart for me, it even learned how to open the window, it used to go out at night to feed, I think. Once while it was gone, I nailed the window shut, but somehow it still got back in, after that I gave up and locked the room and hid the key in case someone wondered in there by accident. 

I think I used the creature as a distraction, I missed Sarah and had become really lonely. Soon I started to believe she would never come home, until one morning I woke up and she was beside me in the bed, I yelled in excitement. “Sarah your back” before jumping on top of her squeezing her tightly. 

“Oh, hi hun,” she said casually as if nothing had happened, before getting out of bed and going to the kitchen. 

I followed her expecting some sort of explanation, she just started filling a bowl of cereal, “do you want some?” she said eagerly waiting for my reply. 

“NO, I DONT WANT FUCKING CEREAL! Where the hell were you?” 

“Please hun, can we just sit down and eat breakfast like a normal couple. Please!” 

I sat there in astonishment staring at her, while she was blabbering on about an article, she had read online about these new health shakes she wanted to try, it was like she didn’t even remember anything. I really wanted to find out what happened, but I didn’t want to push her, besides I was better off if she didn’t remember.   

As the days went on, I noticed she was acting different, calmer, more caring, just nicer in general I suppose, plus, we were getting on better than we ever did before. I thought everything was perfect, until I got up one night and noticed Sarah wasn’t there, so I went looking for her.  

As I was passing the spare room, I noticed the door was open, I could hear her talking from inside the room, “who's a little cutie, you’re a little cutie,” she said as if talking to a little puppy. 

The light was off so I could only make out the silhouette from the light shining in the window. She was sitting on the bed with the creature on her lap, it looked almost human; its tail had nearly gone, and it was able to stand upright, if I didn’t know better, I would have thought it was a child, apart from the smell, and unnatural cry it made when Sarah rubbed its head. 

I got out of there before she saw me, the next day while she was at work, I got my things and left, I didn’t even tell my mom where I was going, and I haven't looked back since.

I've freshly turned 21, about a week ago. Apparently turning 21 seems super exciting, it's not. Maybe it was some kind of bad luck? Or Ive been cursed? I don't know but I regret going into work today.

06:05am - Wake up for work. I hate my job so much,my boss is a sexist man that only seems to target me with his pervert tendencies. 
I work as a "secretary" for a sketchy business, but that's the best I could do for a broke 21 year old without a degree. 

I never got to go to college. My mother died when I was 7 and she was 21, She was a teen mom, She gave birth to me when she was 14 and my dad was 18. She died and the police ruled it out to be a suicide.

No suspects were brought in to be questioned. For them it just seemed like a n young adult who couldn't take it any longer and drove herself to suicide.I looked at my moms autopsy photos. It didn't look like a suicide, more of a murder masked as a suicide. 

My dad has been abusing drugs until CPS
took me away at the age of 10 when someone finally reported him, family from my moms side lived states away, family from my fathers side didn't care, they encouraged his behaviour by sending him money for “me" but they well knew that he was using it for drugs, all kinds of them.I switched between foster homes up to the age of 16 when I got adopted by a low income family. I didn't care about their money, they showed me love.

06:15am - Get up and get ready but I have a feeling someone is watching me. I brush it off and go to the bathroom to splash my face with cold water and forget about that eerie feeling but I can't.

06:45am - I'm sitting at my table eating my breakfast before I leave. Something bangs into my window. I jerked my head to somewhat make out what that was that hit my window, even though it was pitch black out it was just a bird.

07:15am - I get into my car and leave my home, may I mention my house is out of town. It's surrounded by trees and the next house near me is about 5km away.

07:45am - I finally arrive in the town, I still have 15 minutes to get to my actual work. Luckily there's no traffic today, it's always crazy on Mondays.

08:00am - I'm dreading going in, I take my bag, collect myself emotionally in the car and leave. To my surprise,my boss wasn't there? That was odd as he never out, I walked by his office and to my desk, there was a note there

Use this work phone from now on.
• H.Workman

That's weird, why would he give me a new work phone? Doesn't matter l’ll just use it. What’s the worst that could happen? 

My day went by rather quickly with him not being there. I left to go home at 16:15pm and arrived at a estimate time of 17:00pm. I collapsed on my couch, I was so
tired. I shut my eyes for five minutes, I woke up at around 21:32pm. I didn't move for about 5 minutes. 

I smelt food cooking in my kitchen. I lived alone. I quietly got up to peak inside the kitchen. There he was. My boss, dressed in casual clothes, in my kitchen, cooking food. I thought to myself WHAT THE FUCK was he doing in my kitchen. That's when I realised I had my phone in my hand

20 missed calls 
Boss : Where are you????
Boss : Why did you leave so early?????
Boss: I'm coming over. 

What?! I never gave him my address in the first place? It's not even on the system. Why on earth would he come in to my house!?

Wait there’s more…

Boss: I'm 5 minutes away 
Boss : I can't wait to see you
Boss : Unlock your door 
Boss : Unlock it. 
Boss: I already got in 

How? What? When?. Those were the exact thoughts that went through my head in that moment. There's two more texts

Boss : Look at you, sleeping so peaceful. That will be you soon in my bed :-* 
*one attachment*

He took a photo of me and sent it to me? What does he mean by "That will be you soon in my bed" 
I heard him drop something in the kitchen. "SHIT". Oh fuck. I rushed to the couch that I fell asleep in and pretended to still be asleep, I heard him come in the next second He stared at me, just stared. That gave me the same
eerie feeling I got earlier. 

That's when I realised. He was watching me. He watched me get ready for work, He
watched me take a shower, He watched me as I jerked my head to see what hit the window. He planned this all out. He waited for the perfect time to get into my house. I didn't even dare move a muscle. I don't know what he would've said or done if I did.

After being awake for 30 minutes, I now know how he got my address. He was stalking me. I took that work phone home, he put a tracker in it. But why me? 

He seen me look at my phone. Oh my god. He dropped everything he was doing and started walking towards the living room. I got up and ran upstairs as fast as I could. He didn't bother chasing me, he just walked over calmly to me. I hid in my closet in my room. That's where i'm writing this from. I don't know what to do.
can't call the police, he would hear me and since it's out of town there's no way for them to come in time.


I hear him walking around in my room.

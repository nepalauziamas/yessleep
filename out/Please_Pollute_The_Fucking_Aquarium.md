“Rachel, I know you’re on vacation, but I’m going to need you to come in today.  We have urgent matters to discuss,” my boss spoke over the phone.

I frowned, realizing that this was the downside of being the assistant lead marine biologist at the city’s aquarium. 

“Whatever you say.  I will be right over.”  I hang up the phone and grab my keys.

Twisting the ignition, I start up the car in front of my apartment.  Through the heights and the nearby highway, the sky was visible and white as a ghost.  Rain pours down in sheets from a violent storm despite it not being hurricane season.  I take a sip of my coffee as I enter onto the highway more chaotic than a movie theater filled with drunk teenagers.

My car wheels slip against the wet pavement path leading up to the aquarium.  The vast expanse had the architecture like that of ancient Greek ruins and had well-polished marble to complement the atmosphere, too.  Hundreds of glass tanks rise up from the aquarium like awakened underground giants punching from within the Earth’s crust.  Each column of glass was etched with bronze coils and wings, making it resemble something out of a high fantasy anime.  Below the foundation is an immeasurable concrete and glass base that disappears into the ocean.  I park my car and peer off into the water.

Schools of tens of thousands of fish jump out of the water away from the aquarium out of the blue, startling me a bit.

Once I regain my senses, I grasp onto the railing for a closer look.  “Why are the fish suddenly so active at this moment?”  I wonder.  Whales nearby pay no attention to the buffet right within swallowing distance and also swim off.

I veer at the glass columns towering above the blue void.  

“What the heck…” I mumble.  No sea life was contained inside like usual.  The only thing that was inside was a crystal-clear void.  Maintenance workers do take out wildlife if problems are severe enough and they need to get into the tanks.  

But what kind of situation inside the building would be severe enough to cause such a disturbance outside of the building, though?  

Outside from a fuel tank explosion, there is none.

Rushing to my car, I take my work bag.  Automatic sliding doors with brass dolphin symbols squeak open.  A reception desk resides in front the aquarium’s crown jewel: a shark tank massive enough to make the owner of a mansion swimming pool green with envy.

I double take at the exhibit.  It was completely abandoned.

My boss gives me a nod in front of the reception desk.  Her hands were behind her back and her face did not move much as she spoke.  “Good morning, Rachel,” she says.

I shake her hand with a smile.  “You wanted to see me, Linda?”  When I get the message that she means business, my smile vanishes.  “What happened to the shark exhibit?  Did the maintenance workers take the specimens out to fix a problem or something?”

“The maintenance workers checked everything last night.  All was in order.”  As she speaks, she straightens out her white lab coat.

To be on the safe side, I turn to the empty shark tank, taking out a notepad and pencil.

The filters were churning out bubbles like usual.

Salinity content was stable.

The pH was normal as well.

I shrug it off, taking a look at the maintenance agenda, wondering if the animals were just taken out and put in temporary tanks.

Nothing comes up.  I flip each page and inspect them diligently, eyebrows furrowed.

The schedule indicated that animals were indeed, never taken out.

“Our star attraction is not the only abandoned tank.  Have a look.” Linda motions to the expanse the lookout stood over.

“Huh???” I whisper.

Every tank was devoid of fauna.  I pull out some binoculars.  Not even small, insignificant fish were present.  Upon closer surveillance, cavities as dark as soot were just standing there.  Each hole went straight through the sand and concrete as if a mining drill were dropped into the ground and it started burrowing infinitely.  Around the edges of the breaches were claw marks that smoothed out the perimeter and left small clumps of dust.  At some of the pits, teeth and claw marks were gouged into the floor.

Something dragged the marine life down into the depths below the tanks.

While searching for more evidence to support my conclusion, my stomach drops.  For unexplainable reasons, there was neither a single drop of blood or chunk of flesh, nor any decaying debris from the attack.

“Rachel, meet me at the deep-sea exhibit.”

\---

Fake lighting glowed from the plastic and steel replicas of deep-sea fish, mimicking their real-life bioluminescence.  Neon lighting in the corners of the tanks brightened the holes that replaced the creatures in the empty tanks.  Linda motions for us to sit in the theater seats of the visitor area.  She activates a switch which brings down a white projector screen.  A picture of the entire aquarium pops up.

“Five hours after closing time yesterday, the night guards reported that animals were missing from their tanks.  They reported that masses of tentacles erupted from the ground, seizing the creatures and dragging them down like hands of the dammed latching onto a soul, ready to drag it to Hell.  I took some archived footage of the event from the cameras.”

She switches to the next slide with an aerial view of a manta ray tank.  For five seconds, all is quiet with the exception of the hum of the machinery.  In the span of ten seconds, a net of squid tentacles burst out of the foundation, twitching and writhing like the heads of the mythological Hydra: all clustered together and attacking in harmony.  Together, the tendrils latch on to each flapping ray, hauling them into the hole.  A billow of blood spews out from the opening, scattering around the tank and tinting the hole a deep ruby red.  Back up suction cup arms burst out again to siphon up the cloud of maroon.

“Why would a creature want to clean up every last bit of debris possible?”  I wonder.  “Most animals would move on or just take the carcass without worrying if a piece falls off.”

“Two hours before the aquarium was supposed to open, I dropped remote cameras into these holes, hopping to shed some light on the situation.” She flips to the next slide with a cut away view of the aquarium and circles the massive crypt that penetrated the fault line of the beach.

“Each hole led to the trench beneath the oceanarium.  Our job is to figure out what caused this mass vanishing.  The aquarium is equipped with maintenance submarines.  We will use them in order to investigate this situation.”  She clicks a button on the screen, making it retreat back into the ceiling like a snake backing off into a crevice.

“Follow me.”

She guides all of us into an area behind one of the empty jellyfish tanks, leading us to a door marked “AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.”

\---

Water sloshes around from the turbulence below the row of seven fluorescent submarines.  Each machine was surrounded by a single screen shielded by a layer of glass thicker than the Earth’s crust.  On the tail end of the vehicles were five separate motors.  Four were in the corners, one was in the middle.  Each submarine had multiple hatches used to store analysis and repair extensions.

“Why do we have these submarines in the first place?” I ask.

She glances at me.  “They’re meant for repairing the foundation only.  Sea water can erode concrete much faster than you think.”

Lightbulbs swing from cords and illuminate the area.  Linda walks along a painted line over to a control panel, typing in a password.  A small green light flashes, unlocking a box of keys.

For a moment, she keeps her hand still in reticence, letting the wheels turn in her head.  She pauses.  I walk up to her.

“Is something the matter, boss?” I ask, trying to make eye contact.

Linda snaps out of her funk, looks at me, and straightens out her long black hair.  “It’s nothing.  Here.  Let me get your keys.”

She pulls out one of the key bunches and drops it in my open palm.  I look at the key number, match it with the same submarine, and enter the door smaller than a coffin is wide.  The screen at the bow turns on and surrounds me with blue light.  I put on the wire connected steering gloves, fasten my seat harness, and calibrate everything.

“All systems go.” I say.

“I have no clue what is going to be down there, so the both of us must stay together.  We only disperse if I give the order.  Understood?”

“Yes ma’am.”

We release the metallic aquatic probes into the water, splashing it across the floor and the corners of the walls.  Light evanesces into the liquid depths as Linda instructs me to descend into the unknown.

\---

“DEPTH 100 METERS.”  The control system’s voice drones.  

I tilt my right hand down, steering the submarine towards the seabed.  My boss’ vehicle is right in front and has its arms extended in case if things start to go south.  At the perimeter of the screen is my supervisors face staring at her screen.  Linda adjusts her hair once more.

“Please tell me this isn’t what I think it is…” Linda mumbles, shrinking into her seat.

“DEPTH 200 METERS.”

Barely discernible patches and streaks of red hover dozens of meters from the top of my vehicle.  I glance back and check the surroundings again.  The streaks had vanished and no heat signatures except for those belonging to the rest of the steel armada come up.

“DEPTH 400 METERS.”

Beep, beep, beep…The radar reveals a new heat signature.  Tentacles resembling those on the video swoop down and investigate my submarine.  My spine tingles.

Closing my ring finger on my left hand retracts all of the submarine extensions and covers them with steel fixtures.  I raise a finger to my lips.  Heavy breathing echoes from the speakers.  The tendrils slide around the sides of the submarine, attach to the glass panel and tap the sides, searching for an opening.  Eventually, the elastic arms retreat back into the darkness.  I stare up, trying to see the source, but am unable to find one.

My boss starts to hyperventilate when the tendrils come back and start poking around her submarine.  Sweat begins to pour from her brow.  I can hear her breathe heavily through the mike.

“Shut up…” I mouth.

The tentacles drape across her screen and start to tap faster than rain.

Creeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaak…The unseen wraith continues to wrap its dull appendages around the submarine.

After the appendages have lost interest in the probe and retreated, she finally relaxes, wiping some sweat off her head.  I rest my hands on the cockpit chair in confusion.  It’s obvious that was the thing responsible for all the trouble.  The creature could not possibly be any species of octopus or squid.  Not even a giant or colossal could reach a size even close to that of the unseen beast.

What the hell was that thing?

“Boss, should we abort the mission?” I ask.  

“We’re lucky that whatever that thing is, it hasn’t bothered moving to the open ocean.  It could destroy the entire aquatic biosphere if it decides to move elsewhere!  We have to find answers on how to contain it or kill it.”

“That thing could rip open the subs like a wishbone.  What other reasons do you have that would justify us risking our asses and confronting such a threat?”

She makes a chopping motion with her hands for emphasis at each word.  “If the ocean biosphere dies, we’re next.  Do you want to live on a planet without any food?”

“…I understand…Let’s proceed then.”

\--

“DEPTH 1000 METERS.” My submarine drones.

“Hey, Rachel.  I found something.”  Linda says.  A light shines on a cliffside littered with the remains of an underwater laboratory.  Glass and steel corridors have turned into shattered pipes.  Barriers and doorways have been torn off their frames.  Computer and hologram systems are cracked with nothing on them but blank, powerless screens.

Linda swallows a lump in her throat and frowns at the sight of the refuse.

I lock eyes with my boss’ screen.  “You seem tense, Linda.  Do you know anything about this?”

“Twenty years ago, hundreds of underwater research facilities were built in this fault line.  They were all used for an important experiment.”

“Maybe we can find some clues about the monster around here.”

Pushing my arm forward, I float over a path of more inconceivable rubble, trying to find where the trail leads.

I turn back to investigate for more information when my light scans over some more shattered corridors that leads to a basin filled with nothing but more glass rubble.  The light hovers over a small containment tank the size of bathtub.  Half of the thick shield was in splinters.

As I rotate the vessel back, I notice seven more cylinders lying in an aimless heap.  I continue down the steel base of the abandoned laboratory hive, finding thirty more tanks hurled, knocked over, or obliterated.

“What things were stored in these?” I think to myself.

Linda moves her jaw back and forth.  The light on the bow illuminates a suction cup around the size of an apple from a piece of flesh.

“Goddamn it…” she groans.

My face droops a bit.

“That thing can’t be responsible for all this!” she says.

I push my head back with hesitation.  After taking a deep breath, I gain the courage to speak.  “Linda.  Please tell me what is going on.”

And then she beams her light one last time and the color drains from her face.

Limp as boiled noodles are two tendrils the length of seven school buses.  One was constricted around a chewed-up manta ray, the other slunk around the head of a shark.  Its head was a deep, sewage waste brown.  The inside of its mouth was a shimmering abalone blue coloring.

“It was only supposed to go after the foreign creatures…” she whispers.  “It was responsible for the destruction of the aquarium all along…”

I grit my teeth.  The politeness filter just expired.  “Foreign creatures?  Linda, explain yourself!  What did you do?!” I bark.

She sighs.  “Twenty years ago, civilians around this bay area started spotting hundreds of hostile creatures like the one that the tentacles are wrapped around.  They were extremely hard to capture, killed civilians as if they were cattle, and laid waste to this beach area.”

My face loosens up.

“The reason I created the aquarium was because those bastards were destroying the sea life that once flourished in this bay.  I wanted to preserve them and keep them away from them.”

I start to twiddle my thumbs in confusion.  My eyes widen when I realize the gravity of the situation.

Are the hostile creatures searching for us?  Was that unknown beast one of those?  And why would my boss feel guilt towards something that is seemingly out of her control?

My boss rests her head in her hand.  “No one knew how to deal with the hostile entities, so I set up those laboratories to help create some entity that could eliminate every last one of them.  It took hundreds of tries, but we eventually created something that we believed was a silver bullet.”  Her voice speeds up in a panic.  She starts shaking her head rapidly.

“None of this was supposed to happen!  The project turned out perfectly fine after I ran all those tests!  It was supposed to eliminate only the targets!”

Let me get this straight: you tried to contain hostile, unknown, and unpredictable entities by sending out franken-douchebag, which is another hostile, unknown, and unpredictable entity, to sort everything out?”  I raise a brow.

Her mouth tightens, but she eventually speaks.  “Yes.”

“WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!  YOU PUT ALL MARINE LIFE AND OURS IN DANGER!”

Tears stream down her eyes.  “I didn’t have any other choice!  It was the last option we could think of!”

I groan.  “I’m doing this because the world and my job is at stake, not because I feel sorry for you.  Tell me you at least have a game plan.”

“Yes.  I will take the north.  You take the south.  We’ll search for more clues.”

“What about those other creatures?  We can’t just let them roam around!”

“For now, we need to find out how to destroy the failed experiment.”

I take a deep breath and calm my nerves.  “Alright.”

\---

Two hours pass.

“DEPTH 1500 METERS”

“Linda,” I say, holding a sincere hand out.  “I don’t forgive you for getting us into this mess, but I can see why you would create that experiment in the first place.  People do stupid stuff all the time when they are under pressure.  You were trying to do what was right.”

“You don’t need to forgive me.  This is my problem, and I’m going to do everything I can to fix it.  The only reason why I brought you along is because of your intellect.  But now that seemingly everything has been gathered, if you want to leave, I give you permission.  I need to face it alone.”

“I’m not letting the world get destroyed.  We’ll face it together.”

The motors rip apart the water like hooks tearing apart taffy in a factory.  All of the lights are on full blast, yet they don’t even make a dent in the shadow curtains.  However, I get a glimpse of the basin wall and give it the cold shoulder.

Bulbous eyes fill cracks in between the spasming muscles.  Massive conical carbuncles jut hard and firm and point at my ship.  In the opening of the abscess, I can barely make out greyhound-sized brooding pouches.

So that’s where the tyrannical leviathans came from.

“Linda, what is your status?”  

Her screen shows her submarine examining the sea floor and analyzing the tendrils peeking out from fissures and pulsing.  “I’m trying to find answers to this situation.  So far, I haven’t found anything that can be put to good use yet.”  A light begins to glow in the distance, refracting light that shined on the translucent labyrinth.

“Hang on.  I found some giant shimmering thing.  I am going to investigate.  What about you, Rachel?  What’s your status?”

“As we speak, I am descending the main basin.  I think I found the source of the foreign creatures.  Haven’t found any signs of your failed experiment, yet.  Do you know what I should look for?”

“It never reveals its true form to anyone for defensive purposes, so it doesn’t have a weakness that I know of.  We are going to have to figure something out.”

“Are you kidding me,” I think to myself.

The camera on Linda’s submarine pans downward.  Smoker’s mouth yellow spheres the size of fists lie in the recesses of a cliff.  Halos of blood surround black pits in the epicenter.  Stems of muscle and nerve tissue hang from the clusters in the cliffside.

Eyes.

Veiny brain matter surrounds each of the eyes, making them look like the cells of a packed honeycomb, except with the shade and texture of marinara sauce.  Beating hearts throb on top of the conglomeration of assorted cells.

“What in God’s name is that thing?!” Linda looks away from the revolting lump.  She follows the arteries connecting to the tumor.

SPLAT!

Her vehicle crashes into a hidden carbuncle.  When tries to back up from the mini mountain, her ship remains stuck to it.  She activates the prodding arms, ripping apart the mass of tissue and tear into it like teeth against barbecued ribs.  The individual cells on the structure are illuminated on the camera.

“My creation is just one single entity.  This cannot possibly be my creation!  It shouldn’t have evolved to this extent!” Linda panics.  As she frantically pans the camera around, hundreds of flesh mountains are illuminated.

My boss’ sub spins around to get the lay of the land.  A wall of flesh resembling that in the basin fills the crater.  Her light shines on a carcass that had a head matching the brute in the clutches of the tentacles.  It resembled a mixture between a shark and a trilobite and the very end of its tail was still attached to the tip of one of the small hills.  The corpse slides down a bit, peeling down one of the flower-like lips from the base like a banana and revealing the other pouches contained inside.

She turns her head to the mass of random flesh, nodding as an idea forms in her head.

“If I destroy that cluster of eyes, I think that half of our troubles will finally be put to rest.  Focus on finding my creation; I can stop those other monsters from bothering us.”

“Right away.” I say.

I shine a light on a cluster of hanging rocks.  A school of those marine behemoths scatter.  Their tails swish around like whips.

My heart skips a beat.

More trilobite-tailed leviathans slither back into the midnight walls.  They are too far away, so my radar doesn’t make a peep.  Artificial lights resembling jaws flicker on and off before escaping from the armada of submarines.

“Be on your guard.”

Outside from the ocean ambience, the flustered breathing of my boss, and the humming and beeping of the technology, everything is quiet.

Deep crimson tentacles, like those that took out the first submarine, rise out of the abyss.  I motion for the workers to freeze.  “There’s no way we can possibly take down whatever the hell Linda created,” I thought.

Tap…Tap…Tap…Tentacles blanket my viewing screen.  Sensing that there was a human inside the pod, the beast jabs at the screen.  I kick the motor into high gear and flee from the area.

“RETREAT!” I yell. 

The tentacles immediately thrash me around, bashing my capsule into the depression’s sides.  Tendrils coil around the circumference of my ship, grinding the side of the hull.

“HULL STRUCTURAL SUPPORT: 75%,” the intercom screams.  When the monster thinks enough damage has been dealt, it hurls my vehicle right in between two of the conical flesh pods.  My cockpit bounces violently against the gap, thrashing my arms against the rests and pulling them from the piloting gloves.

Shuddering, I frantically and clumsily search for them.  I take a glance at the perimeter cameras, immediately working on fumbling with the steering gloves when four tentacles and two opportunistic sharks give chase.  Finally, I get them on, reactivating the arms and shoving away the first shark.  Next, I work on pulling myself out of the muck.  Out of my peripherals, an elastic arm constricts around the other, dragging it into the penumbras.  Seconds later, a single head is spat out.  Right in the middle is one massive triangular wedge where a tooth had bitten off the rest of the shark’s body.

When I free myself, I thrust the steering device into the max speed, my head scanning around for shelter.

“Linda, what’s your status?”

“I’m just working on destroying the growth,” she says.

All of the flesh mountains burst open from my boss’ point of view, releasing a school of crustacean amalgamations that immediately lock her.  She rips out some of the eyes, signaling the beasts to accelerate even faster.  

I turn my head to the side, watching more of the aquatic predators attempt to bite at the motors.  I find a crevice with just enough space to guide the submarine inside.  Retracting the arms, I gently maneuver it.  I take a sigh of relief as the tentacles pursue elsewhere.  

With one eye on the cameras and one on the screen, I speak to my boss, sweat raining from my brow.  

Her camera shakes as a pair of rusty iron teeth crunch down on the sub and try to open it up.

 “Linda?! Are you alright?!” I shout.

“WARNING!  CRITICAL DAMAGE TO THE HULL!”

Meanwhile, Linda forces the jaws of one of the beasts open.  It releases a blinding flash that stuns both of us for a moment.  A pulse of white blinds me.  Ringing fills my ears and puts me in a daze.  When I snap out of it, Linda’s camera was haywire and another shark joined in trying to open her submarine like a nut.  She takes a mechanical arm and punches the shark in the gills, making it retreat in pain.  She repeats this attack to the other one and it seems to also flee.  The legs of the shark’s long tail latch onto my boss’ submarine, scrapping it against the ground.

Four more sharks join in.  Suddenly, a crescent hole bursts open from the side, water bursting in.

“HULL BREACH!  HULL BREACH!”

Linda just gasps in horror and gives me one last look of sorrow as she types in her coordinates.

“I’ve failed.  I was supposed to stop my creation,” she says, bowing her head in defeat.

My jaw drops when her screen suddenly cuts to black with the message written in red “SUBMARINE 1 SIGNAL LOST.”

“Linda?  LINDA?!  LINDA!” I shout.  “Do you copy?!”

Nothing comes out.

I take a look at my hands in disbelief.  I was now in charge of fixing everything.  A vision of the half-eaten manta ray enters my head.

If my mission fails, the world is bound to end.  

The coordinates pop up in the top right corner.

I narrow my eyes.  It’s time to finish what my boss was supposed to complete.

Beep…Beep…Beep…

I wasn’t alone in the cave.

Something barges against the motors.  I shine a light, noticing that it was another shark.  I try to free myself, only for the mechanical arms to get stuck.

“WARNING!  TOO MUCH PRESSURE ON THE ARMS!” The submarine drones.

The tentacles come back for more, battering the front.  The shark behind me starts to rip apart the motors one by one as if my ship was a flower in the hands of a teenager playing the “loves me, loves me not,” game.  I thrust my hand out, setting the engine on full throttle.  All the submarine did was harshly scratch against rock and barely move.

Eventually, I free myself, severely damaging the arms.  A siren begins to blare.  The shark gives chase, but is quickly snatched up by the tentacles of the unseen monster and dragged into the unknown.  When the shark vanished, dozens more sharks rise out from the darkness, joining in the frenzy.

“Shit!” I yell, rising to the lips of the basin.  The school of beasts try to latch onto the motors and disable them.  They luckily come up short.

“DEPTH 1000 METERS.”

Glimpses of the glass ruins fly past.

“Come on.  Give me a sign!” I growl.

The rotors whirr as fast as possible.  One of the sharks lunges at the camera, only for the tentacles to entrap it.

At the front, the mysterious white glow rises from the tumor’s dwelling.  I thrust the glove forward.

I nod upon seeing the state the mass is in.  Brain matter and eyes were completely removed.  All that was left was a massive beating heart that was covered in more tubes than a dialysis machine.  She reaches for the largest vein and tries to disconnect it.  A school of sharks lunge at her and carry her away.

The tentacles draw in closer towards my cruiser.  I pound my cockpit seat in frustration.

I grunt as I tries to free the arms from the jaws of the leviathans.

In one quick strike, the tentacles all stick onto the sides of the submarine.  The barely functioning motors are overpowered by the strength of the unseen beast.  Sharks ram into the screen like battering rams against a castle.

I grit my teeth as I try to desperately pull away.

Finally, I free myself from the clutches of the beasts, charge at the throbbing vein, and yank it off the heart.  

Suddenly, the aquatic horrors stop moving with an omen of dread hanging over them.  The beasts immediately explode into nothing but cartilage and viscera.  Each of the blasts had a radius of over twenty feet.

Out of nowhere, I am able to pull free from the king-sized kraken.  Without hesitating, I prepare to surface.  The schools of hundreds of sharks were bursting into showers of blood.  Linda’s experiment starts feasting on the clouds of blood in delight.  The walls of flesh begin to burst into nothing but trails of guts as well.

My eyes widen suddenly.

If Linda’s creation has no known weakness, what if we could instead keep it occupied so it would leave the rest of the sea life alone?  Seizing an opportunity to escape, I begin to surface.

\---

A day had passed and a news station came over discussing the sudden cloud of blood around the aquarium.  I explained to them that I found where the beachgoer murdering monsters came from.  In addition, with my boss dead, I became head of the aquarium.  However, I had no intent of holding any sea creatures there.  

Instead, I converted it into a research facility dedicated to figuring out how to find the weakness of the beast.  The tanks were turned into storages for lures, which were just gallons upon gallons of blood, dead fish, and chum.  Day by day, the beast would stick its arms into the holes it left behind from the attack yesterday to feed, giving us time to analyze its weaknesses.  

I told them that I recommend closing all beaches near the coast due to the methods of containment not exactly being foolproof.  The amount of chum thrown into the aquarium was so great that surrounding sea life could not survive long in the waters around.  Their gills would fill up with so much blood that they would suffocate.  This was actually a side effect that was rather serendipitous as it prevented ocean life from coming to close and possibly drawing the beast out of containment.  

Finally, I told the news company was that this lab is doing everything in its power to find a way to stop it, but until then, I advised everyone to dump in some meat in the bay and to please pollute the fucking aquarium.

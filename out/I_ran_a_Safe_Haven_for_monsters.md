Going to Alcoholics Anonymous is very awkward with mortals. 

It’s not like I can properly explain my past. . 

“Hi, My name is Theo Sharpe. I run… well I used to run a [safe haven for monsters](https://www.reddit.com/r/KyleHarrisonwrites/comments/u0nub4/the_safe_haven_story_so_far/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). You know, werewolves, vampires, fae. Things that go bump in the night? Yeah well they are all real and guess what? They are all in danger now thanks to me. Long story really. My sanctuary was burnt to a crisp by the Lord Of Night, and the monsters that trusted me to protect them? I sold them into slavery with these twisted sorcerers called the Solomonari. But that’s fine. It’s cool because they all think I’m dead and I lost my powers so now I’m just a nobody here waiting to die like the rest of you.” 

Yeah that little introduction wouldn’t go very well. But I sit here and I listen to their little bitchy stories about how miserable they are because I can smell something supernatural in the area. 

I was drawn here after spending a few months in the Alps because of an anonymous tip from a Strigoi contact, who claimed that his clan was concerned about a new threat to the area. Vampires are very territorial and ordinarily I knew this stuff would be handled by their High Guards so I thought it was intriguing he tossed a bone my way. 

I wasn’t sure if it was because he felt sorry for me or because he just wanted to send me into a lion’s den and be shredded to pieces. But here I am, and of course, that means I’m exposed to any threat that recognizes me as a fake human. 

I mean, I am actually human now. Nocitifer took my powers of immortality. But what I mean is, I still have that distinct sense like others have that are near to magick and it’s not something you can mask with cologne. 

Sadly though, because I am mortal now, I can’t sense it as strongly as they can so I was definitely taking a risk by being here. 

But it’s not like I have anywhere else to go? Can’t go home. Don’t have one to go home to. 

I’m a nobody and I needed to matter somehow and I told myself that maybe getting in good with this vampire clan could give me a chance to find allies. If I ever wanted to go up against Noctifer I would need some of those. 

My attempts at contacting any High Fae ran dry after the first few weeks, thanks to my mortal status none of them wanted anything to do with me. 

They didn’t really care about the fact that the Bringer of Night was amassing a dark army to take them down either, which honestly made me want to say fuck them. 

But I can’t cause this isn’t really about them anyway. It’s about the creatures I swore to protect that used my safe haven. 

They deserve better than me, but I’m all they’ve got. 

Anyway, enough of that boring backstory shit. My current problems are far more worrisome anyway. 

Each time after an AA meeting I have followed one of the members for a few days to get an understanding of their schedules. 

I think I’ve narrowed down my list of suspects to three in the group that are probably supernatural creatures. 

There’s Todd, he’s a bit of an old school romantic and seems to think that the girl in his apartment should show him attention but won’t. Don’t know why that’s driven him to drink but with that narcissistic behavior I can’t help but to think he might have some werewolf genes. They tend to take what they want without regard for the human toll. 

Roberta is suspect number two, she doesn’t say much but it’s her silence and aversion to conversations that makes me think she might have a connection to my vampire friends. She never wants to be in group pictures and claims to have a skin disorder. Classic vampire profile. Probably a Moroi. 

This is a little tmi, but vampires have strict rules about feeding. This keeps their clans safe from human intrusion. So if a vampire was say, excessively preying on humans then it’s likely that the High Guard would be interested and bring them in rather quickly. 

The thing is, that’s their job and not mine. So I can’t imagine why my contact would think that I could take down a rogue clan member. 

The final suspect is Wilbur, he works at the docks and has been complaining a lot lately about having to work odd hours and getting no sleep. But when anybody asks about his job or what’s causing the insomnia, he clams up. 

The reason he’s on the list is because I went to his job just a few nights ago and it felt off, especially when it came to the security detail. Normal human establishments don’t care that much about security for a boating dock like this, so I figure they must be hiding something in the containers.

Tonight the plan was to get closer and take pictures and figure out what was coming and going from the dock. 

I followed Wilbur and waited until he was already starting his shift, watching the calm Mediterranean and waiting for the boats to arrive. 

This shipment came around 2am, the only reason I recall the time is because alarms blared and I dropped my camera. I was half asleep in my car and felt like a fool wasting my time. 

I sent the photos to my contact though, just in case his well trained immortal eyes could see something I didn’t. 

To my surprise, his response came within moments. 

“What is Bucca Pharmaceuticals?” the text read. 

I glanced at the picture he sent, a zoomed in shot of the logo on the containers and texted back. “How should I know? You’re the expert here.” 

Then, before I could get another response, someone tapped on my window. 

My heart was pounding a bit, fearful that I had been spotted and I rolled it down to politely nod at the bay guard. 

“Hello there. Lovely evening isn’t it?” I said as I gestured toward the bay. His demeanor told me he wasn’t buying it. 

“I suppose I should get going then…”

“You’re coming with me,” the blocky man said as he reached into my car window and slammed my head against the steering wheel. 

A second later he was grabbing my car door and ripping it off, pulling me legs first onto the concrete. 

“Just who the hell sent you?” The guard snarled as he kicked me in the thighs. 

Used to be I wouldn’t need to give two shits about being messed around with like this, I could take a hit and keep going. But now I’m mortal. Now I knew that I wouldn’t be walking straight the next morning. 

Still, I did my best to remain silent as he slammed me against my car and said, “Won’t talk eh? That’s all right. We can find a way to make you talk.” 

He slammed my head so hard against the roof of my car I blacked out. 

When I woke, I was strapped down to a metal chair inside the warehouse and some of his bosses were coming to check me out. 

“What do we have here?” The first man said as he adjusted his sunglasses and got a good look at me. I tried my best to look unfrightened. 

But it didn’t last long. 

“He has contact with the Clan Reinhardt, I couldn’t determine who. Seems that he was sent to spy on us,” the guard said, tossing my burner phone to the boss. 

“Interesting. Seems that they are getting pretty desperate if they hire simpletons like you,” the man said dropping the phone and crushing it with his boot. 

“What’s in the containers?” I said focusing on my mission. I knew that my instincts about them were right and despite calling them out, the criminals didn’t seem too concerned by the revelation. 

“Considering the fact that you’re working with Reinhardt I suppose a peek behind the curtain couldn’t hurt,” the man said. He seemed to be amused by the thought of revealing their secret before torturing me to death. 

He was relishing the idea of whatever nightmares they had hidden being unveiled to me before I was made to suffer. 

And when I saw what was in the containers I understood why. 

There were other vampires here, lower foundlings or newbloods as they were often called each being suspended upside down on silver chains above deep purple tanks of water. The tanks were filled up enough so that each of the vampires could be plunged into it over and over again, held down and forced to thrash about as they were repeatedly drowned. 

Of course since these creatures couldn’t die from such an experience I immediately understood the purpose of this chamber was for their suffering. 

The men in charge were cutting them with crosses and stakes, jabbing their bodies full of holes and then allowing their blood to taint the tank full of water. 

And as we went toward the back of the container I saw they had set up an ordinary tank just for me. 

“You’re going to tell us exactly what the Reinhardt’s know about our little operation, and you’re going to tell us now,” the boss said. 

“They don’t know anything. Only that you’ve been considered a threat,” I admitted. I wasn’t sure why I told the truth. Maybe I thought it might buy me a few more seconds. 

“Oh are we? Well I suppose that’s good to know we are making progress,” the man snickered. 

“You’ll regret ever becoming a thrall for them,” he added as he lowered the chains around my neck.

I saw something in his eyes that gave away his true nature and thought I might try a different tactic. 

“I am not a thrall. I was sent to report for them on behalf of the Alliance,” I told him softly. 

The man hesitated, clearly surprised I knew anything about this. 

“And they trusted a mortal?” he asked. 

“I am merely in disguise. You should let me go, before they find out that you have been breaking the treaty,” I told him. 

He thought about, his eyes dilating a bit as he reconsidered if his little illegal operation was worth dying for. 

“I think you're bluffing. Besides which once you die the Alliance won’t know what happened and we can disappear like we have before,” he declared. 

Then he raised me up by the chains and I felt the air knock out of my lungs. 

I was dangling like a prized ham, struggling to breath as he commented something else that I couldn’t hear. Then I was dumped into the icy water, trying my best to hold my breath as the depths surged around me. 


I felt the chains tighten around my neck as I thrashed and watched them outside the water, the murkiness inside the liquid revealing their true bodies. 

Their skin was scaly and silver and blue, similar to fish skin and their eyes were wide and bulby. No hair and open slits around their neck told me my guess was right. These were merfolk. 

It was a comforting thought right before I drowned. 

But that is not what happened. As I was just about to black out I heard a sharp whistle from above. The merfolk heard it too. 

They looked up and I  saw a large shadowy figure drop from the warehouse rafters. In a flash the strange apparition attacked them. Their oily green blood spilling out across the warehouse floor as the creature attacked each of them, leaving nothing left but quivering fish guts. 

Then I felt the strong pounding of a fist against the glass.  I watched as the shadow smashed open the tank, spilling me out onto the floor and causing me to cough and gasp for life. 

As my eyes adjusted back to the world I saw the carnage and looked up at my savior, the vampire that had contacted me in the first place. 

“Sergei, you’re a little late,” I said as I coughed up more blood. 

“Bucca Pharmaceuticals is owned by renegade merfolk,” the tall pale figure said as he stared at the crimson flowing from my hand. “Figured that out did ya?” Then I paused and realized the blood might be too strong for him to resist. 

“You’re.:. Not hungry are you?” I said hesitantly. 

He looked away and adjusted his clothes before commenting, “Quite full actually.” 

“Well. That’s good then.” 

“You’re welcome,” he said with a whisper and added, “You performed your duty well, despite your current status.” 

“Is that a thank you?” I asked as I studied my injuries. I would probably be out of commission for a week. 

“By the way, how exactly do you guys pay? Please tell me your clan uses PayPal,” I mumbled as I looked up but he was already gone. 

I walked out of the warehouse with bruises and no clue what this issue might have been or if I was any closer to gaining a foothold in the vampire world. 

But I guess it’s a new beginning, and they all have to start somewhere.

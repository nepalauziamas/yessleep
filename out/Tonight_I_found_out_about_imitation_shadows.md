Several minutes ago I was going on a nighttime walk. The temperature was perfect for wandering around the neighborhood and I felt like I needed to clear my mind.

I noticed someone walking across the street from me. A woman with a pink shirt and wired headphones. She didn’t look at me or acknowledge I was there. She just continued moving forward.

I was about to do the same, but then she *fell*. With no warning, she slipped *into* the ground. She didn’t hesitate or stumble. Once her foot had started to sink, the rest of her body came with.

I think I might’ve heard a faint scream, but it could’ve been my mind messing with me. I immediately rushed across the street to try and see if there was some sort of hole that she could’ve slipped into.

The only thing nearby was a shadow. A long, wide, pitch black shadow coming from someone’s clunky mailbox. It seemed much darker than usual. I didn’t know if it was because of the time of day or some other reason, but this shadow looked odd.

I cautiously reached my hand towards the darkness, expecting to touch concrete, but instead finding nothing but air. My hand kept sinking as I moved it downward. The woman had fallen into a shadow.

I decided to walk around and see if any of the other shadows behaved the same. I was careful not to step on any areas of the street that seemed strangely dark or blackened. Each of the shadows lead to nothing. My hand never once landed on solid ground as I reached it inside the various dark spots.

I thought I was either going insane or had discovered a secret of the universe, so I turned around and went home. I’m sitting on my couch now.

See, the thing that worries me is I forgot to turn on the light when I came back in, and there are dark shadows all around me. They look the same as the others. Even when it turns daytime, my blinds are closed, so they will likely still be there. The weird thing is that they weren’t there when I came in, so I was able to jump onto the couch. It’s like they just…appeared.

Edit: They’ve gotten darker over the past few minutes, and I think they’re coming closer to me too. It feels like my living room is becoming encompassed in these shadow-holes.

Edit2: I tested the waters and put a foot in. Sure enough, they’re the weird shadows. The ones that lead to nothing. I hope I don’t have to stay on my couch for too long. I tried shining my flashlight into them but I couldn’t even see the beam. I hope I don’t get sucked in.

Edit3: I’ve just been relaxing, waiting for the sun to come up, afraid to sleep and fall into the darkness. I’ve been staring at the ceiling, trying not to look down.

Edit4: I’m not scared of the shadows anymore. The void is calling me. I’m imagining what it would be like to fall forever, in the same way that woman did. Her screams are echoing in my mind, although I don’t know if they were real or not.

Edit5: The shadows, which have become one big black hole, are almost touching the edge of the couch. I think I’m going to end up falling in either way. I’m debating whether I should jump or not. I don’t have much time.

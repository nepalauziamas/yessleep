I was having a totally normal day just relaxing and making lunch for my sister. Everything was completely fine, dandy, and happy. Almost too normal if you know what I mean? All that was good until I heard my sister talk. I just heard my little sister speak perfect Latin. At first I was like am I dreaming? Did I black out? I rubbed my eyes and no, I definitely was not just hearing things. I took Latin for 8 years but ever since 2020 I have not been practicing it as much as I should. So I am a little rusty. I definitely know it was Latin. She said and I quote: 
“Crescere intus a me sentio. Ardebunt in visceribus gehennae.” 
Which translates to: “I feel it growing inside of me. They will burn in the bowels of Hell.” 
What the actual fuck!! I asked her what did she say? And she said it AGAIN!!!!! I then asked her what did you say? She responded with her typical and normal sounds and grunts. I kept trying to get  her to say it again. Nothing… Absolutely nothing after that. So I made her lunch then did the dishes then put her down for her nap

She is 2 1/2 by the way…. Fucking 2 and a half

What 2 year old can even speak right in the first place? 

I do not know how I feel about that

She is very Autistic and Nonverbal. Meaning she can not speak. She does not even know how to say mom or dad, let alone my own name. 

Where did she learn that from!!! Her cartoons? Movies? Games? Books? 

She can not even speak normally!!

My grandma’s mom spoke pure Latin. She died even before even my mom was born. Grandma passed away in 2020.  I never met my grandpa either he died before I was born. I have no clue or idea how she could do that. The best I can think of is she saw one of my textbooks open and got it from there? But that is impossible! She is 2 1/2. She can not even say mom or dad!

I am shocked, stunned, and honestly kind of scared. I do not even know what else to say. No one else is home except for me and her. She is taking a nap right now. I mean what do you do in this situation? Seriously!! I am sitting here drinking my coffee. This behavior is definitely NOT normal in any way shape or form. I was raised in a religious household so that makes this seem a hundred thousand times more creepy and unnatural. What do you all think?
This is seriously heavy and creepy stuff. What are your thoughts?, suggestions?, comments?, and advice?

Mother and Father will not be home for another two - three days.  Like what the hell do I do!!!!???? I am legit scared and really unnerved!

Let me know what you think!

Anybody had anything like this happen to any of you? 

Crazy shit! I tell you

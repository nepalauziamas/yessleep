 

 

Laying on my bed, I was in my room alone, listening to music. A lot of commotion down stairs; I was waiting for my younger cousins, nieces and nephews to leave, as they were spending the weekend visiting. Since my favorite cousins were already gone, all there was to do is wait for the rest to be gone, so I can have peace and quiet back in my life. A few hours later, close to midnight, the rest of the family are leaving out to hit the road. I’m pumped up to finally have the house to myself again, with the acceptance of my brother and parents, so I go down stairs to get me a nice cold cup of apple juice. With my headphones till on, singing to my favorite song I pour the juice and sit on the living room couch.

Sitting there for about 30 minutes, I take off my headphones, and check Instagram. I took a slight cut at the window to a sight that made me jump off the couch. A face. It was literally just sitting there, smiling, staring directly at me. Everywhere I walked it had its eyes locked right onto me. After a few seconds, I figured it was just one of my older cousins playing around with me after they left a little late. So, I walked outside to see. Dumb decision. 

Outside, I look towards the area where the face was. Nothing. I screamed out several of my cousins' names, telling them the joke wasn’t funny, but still, nothing. I walked back inside the house, and there it was again. Shaken, I freeze in my place. 

That whole night, I could not sleep at all

This proceeded to happen every night for the past week.

The same thing looped over every single time. I would see the face, fail to sleep for the night, sleep throughout the entire day, and then wake up during the night-time. There was nothing I could do about it. I didn’t tell anybody else in the house because I knew there was nothing they could do; And I was in fear of putting them in danger. I felt as if the cops weren’t gonna be able to do anything about it, and I was worried that the face would get angry.

But, one day, it was different.

It was Monday night, a week later since it started, and I felt more angry than scared this time. After getting almost zero sleep, and stressing over this weird bastard staring directly at me, I was tired of it.

I quickly grab my phone and dial 911, hoping there was SOMETHING they could do to get this weirdo to leave me alone. Maybe this is an actual human who could actually get arrested. I didn’t know, but what I DID know is that someone has to deal with whatever or whoever this thing is and make them leave me alone.

But, as the loud 3 beeps occurred from my phone, something snapped.

The face changed. It wasn’t smiling anymore; It was angry. 

The way the face changed so suddenly, from a creepy smile to a disappointed frown. It was as if it was animated.

Shivers went down my spine. As I put my phone up to my ear, the face quickly moved away from the window. It sprinted towards the way the door was located. Freaked out, I quickly ran up the stairs, I didn’t want to risk checking if the door was locked.

I sprint into my room and lock the door. As I hid in the closet, 911 picked up. “911 what’s your emergency?”

Sweaty and damn near in tears, I explain to them about what’s been happening. When I told them my address, they told me my officers were on their way.

I nervously wait in the closet.

Luckily, not too long after I called, I heard police sirens outside my house. As they knock on the door, everybody in my house wakes up from their sleep.

As I go outside, alongside my family, I see one officer come up to us. He tells me there’s been a local creep going around houses in my neighborhood for the past month. People reporting a person looking through their window, noises in their bushes, weird sightings; And all of the witnesses were 15 and below. Thanks to me, they caught him that night, attempting to hide in the grass and bushes. 

5 days later, my family is watching the local news. 

The man broke out of prison, and there’s been a search party sent out for him.

1 month later, he hasn’t been caught since, and it’s always been on my mind. We have curtains on every window now, but, will that stop him? Or will it push him to do worse. Be careful, he might be watching you. With or without curtains.

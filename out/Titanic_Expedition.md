I need to get this story out i dont have much time. I was on a Titanic expedition to take new images of the wreck and map out the area once again to see if anything has degraded over time and to see generally how the ship is maintaining after 110 years. On day 2 of the expedition we noticed a new area had opened up as the wall that stopped us from seeing this area previously had fallen down since the last expedition a couple of months ago.

When we looked at this new area we expected to see   more 3rd class rooms as that's what is meant to be there according to the blueprints of Titanic but what we actually saw was something else, something we never thought to see, we saw a prison cell but it wasn't any normal prison cell there were chains everywhere, it was something no one could explain so at this point we returned to the surface.

We showed our findings to the expedition leader once we got to the surface but he didn't have an answer either so we called it a mystery and moved on however this would not be the last we would here of this as during dinner the US Navy surrounded our ship. We were all extremely confused but we let them board our ship, once they were on board we saw atleast 25 soldiers, and government officials from both the US and UK. 
We were confused about why the British were here but they said its because Titanic was a British ship so we settled with that answer.

They made us hand over all the evidence of this prison room we found and sign NDA contracts. We all questioned why but they said we found something we weren't meant to see, at that moment we were all nervous and confused but once the US Navy collected all evidence and everyone signed the NDAs they left and we went to sleep confused but hoping to forget about it the next day and continue our expedition as we still needed to get images and make new maps of the stern, "tomorrow won't be the same as yesterday and it will be better than today" as I drifted off into sleep.

I woke up to things being thrown around and loud crashes everywhere, I checked my phone and the time was 3:33 AM and I realised pretty quick we were in a bad storm so I got up to go help on deck but as I was getting dressed I fell and hit it my head which made me unconscious.

"are you alright, love. You took a nasty fall"
As a woman said to me with a British accent as I woke up. I touched my head as it was painful and the same woman said "oh your awake I will go fetch some tea for you right now sir" I was very confused and I got up slowly and I opened my eyes and saw I was in this cabin which looked like a first class suite on the Titanic. I was taken aback by this and I didnt know what to say or do since I thought my crew mates where playing a joke on me. 

At that exact time the woman from before came in and said "hello sir I'm glad your awake I got some lovely tea for you". I replied by saying "thanks, I love this room it looks like a suite on the Titanic" the woman looked puzzled when I said this and she said to me "sir I think you really hit your head" as she chuckled "your on the Titanic" my face turned pale and I asked "what?" She replied "we just left Ireland our final stop before New York so now I can safely say we are New York bound" she then asked me "did you mean to get off in Ireland" me not knowing what to say said "no I didn't" I then got nervous thinking this was real so I said I had to go to the woman and left the room.

I walked into the grand staircase and I looked at everyone walking past and I saw some passengers i recognised from hours of studying Titanic and its passengers. I then went up on deck and spent hours walking around and trying to convince myself it's all a dream but as the hours past the more real it became, I was in 1912 on a doomed ship.

I suddenly remembered the prison we had discovered and since i remembered what deck it was on I decided to go see it, as I desended the stairs of Titanic my mind was racing, not knowing who was in there, a serial killer, a bank robber who knows I was excited to see who as this would be a huge break in history.

When i got the the deck I began to walk towards the prison but as I got closer 2 stewards stopped me and they said I had to leave or I would be removed by force. At this moment I was terrified but also even more curious. Not wanting to get shot I left. That evening I had no idea where to sleep for the night but I found a storage room and slept there, hoping I would be back home with the expedition crew instead of on a doomed ship that would sink in just 2 days time as now it was midnight of April 12th.

(Fast forward to the night of April 14th)

 In just one hour the Titanic will hit an iceberg is what I thought to myself as I walked along the decks of Titanic, breathing the cold, crisp and icy air.
I decided to head inside and have one final attempt to see the prison and when I got to the deck the prison was on I saw there were no stewards there and I walked on through. As i walked through I saw a door open and I heard the same stewards that stopped me from the other night and another man I didn't know. I was intrested in what they were talking about as they were speaking about the prison.

I listened and heard "it has to be tonight" the unknown man shouted" "one of the stewards said "I know sir we will kill the captain tonight all will be handled" the unknown man then replied "good and John once Charles kidnaps the captain you steer the ship into the iceberg" "yes sir" both stewards replied to unknown man. The unknown man then said "remember the mission, the creature has to die and this is the way to kill it. We can't let the public know about this". 

I then went to hide as I heard them leaving the room, at this point my mind was going crazy, knowing the Titanic was sunk or purpose to kill what ever creature was In this prison. I had to see it, when I saw no one was around I snuck into the prison and what I saw made my jaw drop.

The creature was terrifying I stared at it for what felt like an eternity, it was around 9 feet tall, it had 6 arms  and its mouth was on its chest and had what looked like millions of teeth. In the shock i dropped a can of tuna i had saved from the 3rd class dinner and I guess one of the steward heard this as i heard footsteps coming from outside so I went to hide behind a box. The steward came into the room and said loudly "is anyone in here, come out now" at that moment the Titanic hit the iceberg and everything was shaking. Once the shaking stopped he turned towards the creature and said "you maybe able to live underwater for long periods of time but now you will drown being stuck underwater for all eternity joining the people you killed in that town in death" he began to laugh which angered the creature and at that moment the creature broke its chains and broke out the prison killing the steward in anger. I thought would die but to my surprise the creature just left the room and forgot about me. 

I realised I changed history, that creature was meant to die along with the other thousands of passengers of Titanic and I figured this creature was not meant to escape since no survivor mentioned it in interviews i saw before and I just made it escape since it escaped because of the steward when he angered it and I was the reason the steward was in there.

My heart was racing and I suddenly began to hear screams from passengers and I heard the creature roar as it made its way through the ship. I decided to stay hidden In the prison room as the creature didn't know I was in there and I figured it was the best option.

Time past and I heard silence, no more screams, no more roars just nothing. I decided to leave the prison and see what was going on, while I was leaving I saw a grandfather clock in the room I saw the stewards and unknown man talking so I went in and I saw the unknown man dead on the floor, his throat ripped apart, I knew I had to escape so I checked the time on the grandfather clock and realised the Titanic bow was just going underwater or so I assumed since it was the thought time the Titanic bow began to flood 

As I went up to the top decks I saw many dead body's and when I got to the top the place was covered in blood and dead body's as was the outside deck. I didn't see the creature so I headed towards the stern, I wanted to throw up at the sight of thousands of dead body's but I knew I had to be stong or I would become another dead body. 

I got to the stern and saw the creature wasn't there either so I went to go set up and launch a lifeboat so I could escape the ship as it was still sinking but as I was about to I saw it towards the front of the ship, the creature and this time it saw me. 


It began to roar and charge at me so I ran too but I knew I wasn't fast enough. I knew I was about to die.
The creature then jumped on me to catch me and because he did this it sent the both of us flying into a wall which resulted in me hitting my head and going unconscious.

When I woke up, i woke up back in my room in the modern day of 2022 on the expedition ship. I was relived it was all I dream until I went outside, I saw all my crew mates dead lying dead on the floor and I realised it wasn't a dream. I figured when I hit my head the creature did too and I guess me going back to my time also brought the creature to my time too.

I checked my laptop and searched Titanic and I saw many new articles "Titanic mystery. What happened to the Titanic" "What caused the Titanic to go missing in 1912" "Titanic mystery is solved as ship is found underwater" i noticted the article was published in 2018 which i guess means that the ship was found alot later than in my reality. At that moment i searched how many people survived the Titanic and I saw it said 0.

I called the coast guard for help and they have come but I'm locked in the storage room. They are accusing me of the murders of my crew.

I need all those that read this to know that I didn't do those murders this creature did and its somewhere in the world. If you see it run away it will kill everything. From what that steward said I assume its like a dolphin, as he said it can stay underwater for long periods of times but he also said it could drown which means it has to come up for air at something.

I don't know how long it will be underwater for but please leave the coast one day it will come up and kill us all...

I will update if I get any new information on the creature but I think I will be arrested once I leave this storage room and I doubt people will believe my story but to those who read this

Run far from the coast and don't look back

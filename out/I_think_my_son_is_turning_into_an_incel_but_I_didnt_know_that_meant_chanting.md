Well, it was a Tuesday, and I'd just come home from work. There was a terrible smell in the house. It was like, I don't know how to describe it, like red meat but much stronger, and also it smelled filthy. The smell had come all over the house, so I tried to find where it came from, and I realized it came from my son, Filly's room.

Don't get me wrong. I don't really go into my children's rooms. I hated it when my parents went into my room, you know? They have a right to privacy, and I really don't want to break that, but this smell was awful, and I just wanted to see what it was.

I remember when the door opened, that the room was much darker than I expected. It took me off guard. It was basically pitch black in there, and I had to patt the wall for the light switch which had been covered up by tape. By this point, I wasn't too sure if I should continue, but I mean, I'd already started right?

His room was a mess. Not like a teenage boys mess. No, this was on another level. His bed had been flipped upside down. He'd taped different objects to the roof. His school books had been ripped apart. Oh, right, and in the very middle there was a goat head.

I'm not lying. There really was a goat head. The sight of it's dead eyes seemingly staring at me is burned into my head. I don't think I've screamed so loudly you know? I mean I slammed the door shut, but it was that head which had produced the smell so I did what I had to.

I think it was the bugs that really freaked me out. I stepped into his rom and coackroaches sprinted up the walls. Yeah. I mean, I thought the goat head was disgruntling but compared to those things? They made me march into the room as quickly as I could, but only when I was standing almost on top of the head, did I see the red book beside the head.

*The True Man's Handbook - how to get any Becky or Stacy*. It was a thick book, probably around a thousand pages I'd say. I think that was what made me pick it up. I really wanted to know how you'd fill all of that up, and I wanted to know what was so special about girls named Becky or Stacy.

I spent the rest of the day reading through the book. It didn't capture me, but it was so bad that it was almost entertaining. I could tell that the author meant for this to be taken seriously, but I couldn't help but think he was being sarcastic. I mean they were talking about women like they were sim characthers.

At least for the first chapters.

Then it got wierd. After about twenty pages it got repetitive, so I decided to flick through it perhaps to find an interesting chapter title, or something along the lines. On page three hundred and fifty six though, there was a passage on China's political state. It was well written too. I read further and it just kept going. I checked if it was still the same book. I couldn't quite see what this had to do with anything.

Around page 500 the letters looked to be handwritten. They were hard to get through, and complicated, and I really had to focus to read a single page. It seemed to be discussing the difference between a virgin heart, and a "filthy" heart. By this point it wasn't funny anymore. I wasn't really in the mood for it. So I flicked the the last page to see what the authour ended it on.

*Thank you for reading. Do summon me when you can.* 

Strange. That was the only word going through my head. Strange. I put the book aside, and decided to listen to a podcast to try to clear my mind. Even serial killer's couldn't budge the sensation of disturb in my head. That says something I think. Right?

When I confronted Filly about it, he acted in a way he'd never done before. It shocked me to be frank. He screamed and shrieked, really shrieked, and told me that I was a disgusting femoid that shouldn't enter his room. He ripped the book out of my hands, and stormed away. I don't think he thought he had made a single mistake.

That night I was woken up. I think it was around 3 AM. I heard my son chanting. I don't even know if it was my son. It was a language I'd never heard before in my life. Lots of *Tch* and *Sh* noises thrown in with whistles. Also, his voice was the darkest I'd ever heard it in. It sounded like he'd hurt his own throat.

The next day, when I saw him, I didn't think I was seeing him. He looked completely different. We're not talking about a make-over, I mean, he was taller and his chin was more defined, his hair looked more vigorous. But he didn't look like my son. I couldn't see it in him. Also, his pupils looked sharper. I asked him what happened to you? And he responded to me with *shut the fuck up bitch and go make me a sandwhich.*

I've never seen my husband get angry enough to fight somebody before, but that did it. He socked Filly in the jaw sending him tumbling towards the wall. They exchanged with some curses and threats and it ended with Filly almost getting thrown out of the house. I manged to calm him down. I mean it was still our son.

Filly came home that day with two girls. They looked spell-bound. I mean literally, they didn't act proper. I think there was something wrong with their heads. They giggled at every little thing he said, and when I asked them a question, they seemed to be in a daze and couldn't answer me.

That night I heard him chanting once again. I heard the girl's voices with him. I thought I could hear the word satan multiple times. Our room got really hot for a while, but then it dissapeared, and silence once again filled the room.

The next morning my son looked even more different. He was *extremely attractive.* I mean I couldn't take my eyes off him, and I know he's technichally my son but he didn't look like it anymore. I couldn't recognize him. What stood in the hallway, staring at me, seemed to be a stranger and a super-model. that was it. 

*Hello mother.* He said. I swear he sounded Brittish. It wasn't just his looks that had changed, but the way he acted too. He seemed much more confident, and also charming. I hung on every word he said.   
I asked him where the two girls had gone and he told me that they'd left. That was all he said on the topic. Later that day, he came back with eight girls.

They were chanting later that night. Same thing as the last time. I pushed my ear against the wall, eager to hear what it was they were saying. It was more clear this time, sounded like actual English, but a twisted version of it. Words meshed together in a way they weren't supposed to. There was the opposite of flow and harmony. He spoke about servicing the greatest master, and that he was ready to give up *anything,* to do it. Once again it got really hot. I mean this time I had a tough time breathing. And then it all dissapeared, at once.

The next morning, when I met him in the hallway, I knew it wasn't my son anymore. I mean I had a tough time looking him in the eyes. The aura he carried was one filled with death and horror, and I felt my heart shake when he glanced at me. This could not be my son, but yet it must have been.

I asked him where the eight girls had gone and he told me that they had left. And then he said something else, an explanation to why. I can't remember what he said, but I remember what I felt. I was completely convinced, I mean there wasn't a single doubt in my mind.

He walked up to me and kissed me on the lips, and he smiled, satisfied with himself.

Was that a little bit sudden? That's exactly how I felt. I didn't expect it, and I was completely frozen after he did it. I mean I don't feel disgusted, and that disgusts me. That's my son. Or it was at least. I don't really know what it is anymore? He seems uncaring, and his pupils are more slitted than ever.

He didn't come back after that. No matter how many times I called his phone did he answer, and the school said that he hadn't shown up. I reported him as missing but the cops haven't done anything so far. Finally I decided to check his room , and it was clean this time. Clean and orderly. but also, there was a circle of burnt wood in the middle.

There was a small note stuck on the thick, red book which I fear has done this to my son. It said, *Be happy for Filly. His body gets to carry me.*

&#x200B;

We met with Roy this week. Although, it took some convincing on Alma’s part. We drove to his apartment in the next town over. He rang us in through the intercom. Then we parked and took the elevator.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At least he seems to be doing well for himself,” I commented as it was ascending. 

&#x200B;

“In what way?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The doors opened and we stepped out. His place was located at the end of the hall. We knocked and soon heard the sound of several locks and a chain being undone. To call the man in front of us, a giant would be an understate. He was towering and pretty muscular to boot. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Come in,” he said, stepping aside for us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was much more reserved than his appearance would lead someone to believe. He closed the door and turned to us. There was a long pause before he spoke again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You both know if it weren’t for Mrs. Simons I wouldn’t be doing this.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“We realize as much,” I replied. “And we want to say that we appreciate you doing this.”

&#x200B;

“Right. Can I get you anything? I have some  beer if you want it, but I try not to drink a lot.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly declined and I accepted a glass of iced tea.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I assume Mrs. Simons already gave you the gist of what happened?”

&#x200B;

“She did,” Kelly replied, “but we figured you’d be able to tell us more about it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy stared at the floor with his arms crossed and shifted uncomfortably. He unfolded them, letting them fall to his side, and then looked at us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I haven’t told my therapist what I’m about to say. Hell, I never even told the counselor my mom took me to back then, but here goes I guess. So, Maty…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A pained look came over his face. He kept going.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He was the smartest of us, being older and all. I wanted to be just like him. You know how it is.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That made me want to smile. I was the same way with Jake.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sure that got on his nerves, but he was nice about it. Now, during that summer I wanted to build a treehouse. Marty was smart enough to know that wouldn’t work with only the two of us so, he convinced me a fort would be just as good.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The story seemed innocent so far which made me worry. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Being the overeager little shit I was, he was always looking after me. The fort was supposed to be a sort of project we’d do off and on. As a matter of fact, we promised if we made it well, we’d try making a treehouse one day.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy groaned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Too bad that didn’t pan out.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point, we needed o know something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can you remember when you first noticed it?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“I wasn’t the first to. Marty was,  There was this crow that he said was following him. It didn’t look out of the ordinary from where I was standing, but he said it rubbed him the wrong way. He even told our mom and of course, she thought it was his imagination running wild.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I took another sip of tea as he went on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I didn’t believe him either. I can remember times when he told me he was afraid to go outside. I couldn’t unless he was watching me. When he refused to, I’d mock him until he did. I  bet he didn’t want me thinking less of him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy got lost in thought briefly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I should’ve listened.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His voice trembled and he hung his head.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Roy, you were just a little kid,” Kelly told him. “You couldn’t have known.”

&#x200B;

“I know, but still. Do you two mind if I take a break?”

&#x200B;

“Go ahead,” I answered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He left to go smoke while Kelly and I talked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So far, his story does seem to line up with the theory,” she said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, let’s just hope he can help us narrow down where it lives. Too bad we still don't know what can hurt it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy came back in.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Sorry, that took so long.”

&#x200B;

“Don’t worry about it,” I said. “Are you ready to keep talking?”

&#x200B;

“Yeah,” he replied and plopped into his armchair. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He got comfortable and picked up where he left off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So like I said, he was the only one in our house that was aware of that thing. He was always jumpy when we went out which also made me angry because I wanted to play with him. At the time, I thought he was just ignoring me. Our mom was strict about curfew which probably gave him some relief.”

&#x200B;

“Did he bring it up to anyone else?” Kelly inquired.

&#x200B;

“He did tell our grandparents when we went to visit and they were just as dismissive. You know, that week we spent with them was the most relaxed he’d been all summer. Although, he still seemed to be looking over his shoulder half the time.”

&#x200B;

“You mentioned him saying he saw a weird crow earlier. Did he mention seeing it when you were over there?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy thought about it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Not that I can recall, but it was waiting for us when we got back home. We’d almost finished the fort before we left so there wasn’t much left of it for us to work on. Two weeks before school was when it happened."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At this point, I could feel myself growing steadily more nervous. Even though we both already knew what the result of all this was, that didn't make it any less unnerving to hear. I glanced at Kelly. She was digging her nails into her palms.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I got mad at my mom. I can’t remember why. I was probably acting up and she was going to punish me so I ran away. My idea was to go live in the woods.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

 Roy chuckled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Can you believe that? It was already dark by the time I slipped out. When our mom saw that I was gone, she freaked out and called people to help find me.”

&#x200B;

“What was your brother doing?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“He was asleep. Our mom couldn’t leave him alone to go look for me so she grabbed him and took him to a neighbor nearby.”

&#x200B;

“And what were you doing?”

&#x200B;

“I was by our fort, playing on our Gamegear.” 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was something I hadn’t thought of in years. Jake owned one growing up and we’d play on it a lot. The damn thing drained batteries like crazy, but it was fun. My mind snapped back from reminiscing to present-day with a cold splash due to what Roy told us next.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s when I heard it, moving through the trees.”

&#x200B;

“What did it sound like?” Kelly asked, somewhat shakily.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I took another sip of my tea and upon lowering the glass, I noticed my hand was beginning to tremble. I set it down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Munching. We do get wolves around here. They tend to leave people alone, but the thought of them at the time scared me shitless. I wish it was just some wolves. It would have been less traumatic.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy fidgeted with his sleeves nervously.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I thought it would be safer to go in the fort and wait until morning. Stupid I know. I couldn't think of anything else, though. God, those sounds. Everything else was quiet except for that. Fast forward a bit and something was coming towards the fort.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I felt my chest get tight as Roy kept speaking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was Marty. Apparently, he snuck out too. He already knew where I’d be and I guess he thought letting our mom know would have taken too long. I’d never seen him so scared. He was practically shaking. Despite everything going on, I was still afraid of being punished. He tried to convince me to come home right away and I should have listened. I was stubborn.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What Roy said next is something that even only hearing it second hand, will be something I won’t ever forget.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He pulled me out kicking and screaming. He tried to get me to shut up and then we both saw it, perched on one of the branches. It looked like a bird except none I’d ever seen before or since. I guess the closest one I can compare to would be a falcon except way larger. This thing was big enough to carry away a grown man let alone some little kids.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He started to sweat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Even though it happened so long ago, I still remember all of it. Dear Christ, its screech. It was like scraping glass. It lunged at us from the branch and even though Marty was scared, he pushed me out of the way in time. It caught him and he screamed at me to run. I don’t know how I did it honestly. My mind was pretty on autopilot. I was so scared I blacked out while I was running and I swear that godforsaken abomination was laughing as it tore into him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy took a deep shaky breath and exhaled.

&#x200B;

“His screams were loud enough to wake the dead. Our mom eventually found me, a shivering incoherent mess. They found Marty’s body a month later.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His voice trembled again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It…It ate his insides. That’s something I didn’t find out until years later when I asked about it. Anyway, my parents were obviously never the same after that and neither was I. Just ask Mrs. Simmons, but do you know what the truly fucked up thing was? It was that after he was confirmed dead, there would be nights I thought he was calling to me from the woods, telling me to come save him or that it was my fault what happened or even to simply play with him. I never fell for it luckily. I was too scared. Anyway, fast forward to now and here we are.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly and I didn’t say anything for a while. I was thinking about how that kind of event would shape someone. For it to have happened so young, there is no way that's not the case. Eventually, Kelly spoke.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That's horrible," she said. "Why didn't you move further away? I would have."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy let out a long sigh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I got friends who live near here, ones that helped me get through what happened so I never felt right about leaving."

&#x200B;

"What about your mom?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"She moved a few states over. We still talk and she seems to be doing good for herself. Same thing with my dad. Although, part of me thinks he may feel the guiltiest of all of us. I haven't asked him about it, though. We try to avoid that topic. That's my story so do you have any other questions?"

&#x200B;

“Have you been back to that area since you moved?”

&#x200B;

“Fuck no.”

“Besides it, was there anything else you came across that was strange that night, maybe some kind of lair?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Roy stared up in thought.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Now that I think about it, I do remember seeing an unusual-looking tree. It was like it had been pulled apart and then collapsed back together. I didn’t think much of it.”

&#x200B;

“Do you remember where it was?”

&#x200B;

“Not aside from it being in the woods near our house, sorry.”

&#x200B;

“I see. Well, thank you for your time, Roy, but we should get going.”

&#x200B;

“Wait,” Kelly interjected.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We turned our heads to her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you know a good place for us to get weapons around here?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So now we’re back at the hotel. We’ll be meeting another guy during the upcoming week to buy some guns from him. Then we’re going to try and find that tree. If new information comes to our attention, I’ll post about it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I guess we’re going to go face it finally. The thought of it is already frightening enough. What scares me, even more, is the fact I don’t know what are chances are against this thing. Even though Jake couldn’t hurt it, maybe with enough firepower, we can put this fucking thing down. If anyone has any ideas that can help us, we’re open to them. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Otherwise, if I don’t post again, you'll all know what [happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) to [us.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

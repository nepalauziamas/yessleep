Hello everyone, it's Kelsey again. As promised, I have a couple of significant updates for you, the first and most important being that this will probably be my last update for a while. I managed to set up a VPN to post this, but Bacon and I will be on the road for a while. I also wanted to thank everyone who reached out to express their support and offer a couple of theories. In case you don't know me, you can find my first post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v2laim/i_heard_something_in_the_woods_last_friday/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). 

I did look into what a wendigo is. The commenter who made the suggestion was pretty on the nose, but many details don't line up. I am glad I looked into it, though.

Bacon has not been doing too well, I thought he would even out once we stayed away from the house, but I was wrong. He hasn't been barking, is hardly touching his water, and has turned down human food multiple times. I offered him chicken, and for the first time, he didn't want it. I love my dog, but he is starting to freak me out. I am hoping he is just traumatized.

Now, in the comments I mentioned, I was going to chase a couple of leads, and I will get to that, but first, I want to tell you guys about the police. When I followed up with them the first time, I was told a bear likely attacked Bacon and me. I knew this was false. A bear can't mimic the screams of a human. Still, when the officer was filling me in, I couldn't help but feel like I was being lied to. After they updated me, I went back to my house to pick up supplies. When I arrived, I found police tape cutting off my property. Once I got close to the tape, I could feel the hairs on the back of my neck stand up; I didn't dare cross the police tape. I wasn't scared of being arrested; I was afraid of running into that beast again. After that, I decided to chase a couple of leads.

**The First Lead**

I found my first lead a couple of blocks from my house. I was hesitant to go into the woods, but it had to be done. I had to leave Bacon at the hotel for this lead since he was still shaken up from the whole experience. Despite my anxiety, I decided to push up the dirt path.

The first thing I noticed about this property was its fence. Unlike mine, this man had a tall fence that came up to a point at the top. You know? One of those gothic-looking fences. It was much taller than my fence, and the gate had a buzzer attached. When I looked through the fence to see if anyone was home, I noticed how dead the lawn looked. It was dry and covered with weeds. The next thing to take me by surprise was his car; it looked like he had been in a major accident. As I pressed the buzzer, my mind began to wonder. No one in town had ever spoken about this property. The only reason I knew where to go was because of an old newspaper I found in the hotel.

"Who is it?" The man asked. I had to rip my hand off the buzzer because I had been leaning on it while I was thinking. "My name is Kelsey, I am one of your neighbors, and I would like to talk to you," I remember my words perfectly. It was the first time I had been sure about myself in about two days. I had to beg the man to let me in. The longer I was outside, the more nervous I got. If I had been attacked by the creature here, I would have been dead. Luckily, my pleading didn't go unheard. After what felt like an hour, he finally buzzed me in.

I watched as the front door opened, and the man walked onto his porch. He looked nothing like he sounded. His white beard was clean and properly trimmed, and his boots looked nice. But I'll be honest, the shotgun in his hands sent me back a little. The more I looked at him, the slower I moved. "I don't have all day!" He said as he moved out of the way and held his door open for me. If the circumstances were different, I would have never gone into this man's house.

"I'm sorry to bother you. I found an old newspaper. Your name came up a couple of pages in. You said you had seen some creature in the woods." I said to him as I looked around his living room. He had weapons galore. I had never seen so many guns, never mind the bear traps and other things. Next to his door, he had a long blade, and in the doorway to the kitchen, there was a baseball bat just waiting to be grabbed.

"I am surprised you saw that interview. It was a long time ago." The man began to speak as he closed his front door. "I take it you've seen the beast?" The man asked as he walked over to his windows and looked outside. Everything about this whole encounter was making me uneasy.

"I did. I saw it face to face." I told the man about what I had seen, how Bacon hasn't been himself since, and I went on about how the cops seemed like they were hiding something from me. I told him about the newspaper I found, how it had been stashed between two books in my hotel room. As I spoke, I watched his face twist with concern, and that's when I realized he was just like me. Fear was the glue that was holding us together.

He told me about what he had seen, how the creature would linger just behind the fence until the sun went down. Once it gets dark outside, the beast will try and get past the fence. He told me why we didn't have many neighbors; people who lived near us were either killed or moved. After his story hit the local newspaper, men showed up at his house with a large sum of money. He took the money and promised to remain silent.

We went back and forth. We discussed why the police would hide this, who the men who gave him money were, and what the creature could be. I told him about my post, and he warned me against making another. As we spoke, the sun went down, and that's when he invited me to stay the night. I couldn't place it while I was at his house, but I know the feeling now. I extremely distrusted this man; although I believed his words to be true, something was off about him. That night I decided to stay awake. There was no chance I was sleeping in this house.

Around two in the morning, I could hear the creature again. It was mimicking Bacon's whimpers. When that didn't get my attention, it imitated his barking. Fear shot through my body and sent my heart into maximum overdrive. I wanted to throw up. After it was done "barking," it began screaming. I recognized that scream because it was mine. It was taunting me. It wanted me to come outside.

About an hour later, it began screaming again. This scream sounded more high-pitched. "Please, d-daddy, come and find me!" Its twisted voice called into the darkness. The words cut through me like a hot knife through butter. "The wheels on the bus go round and round!" It howled at the gates. I had to move my hands over my ears. I didn't sleep that night, and the man didn't come back downstairs until six in the morning.

He wouldn't let me ask any more questions. He told me to make sure I never spoke around the creature, and he told me the woman's name who took his story in the first place. After that, he forced me to leave his home. I couldn't wait to get back into town but crossing the fence line made me feel sick. Once I was able to get back to my four-wheeler, I climbed on and drove back to the hotel.

 

**The Second Lead**

When I got back to the hotel, I grabbed Bacon and whatever else I had. I even took the blanket from the hotel room before realizing I didn't have a car. Renting one was out of the question; I was thankful I had my wallet and cards with me. I got Bacon and I food before taking us to the second lead. I was not going back to the hotel.

The following lead would take us deep to the outskirts of town, further than my house. I never came down this way because I don't know anyone down here. The sinking feeling had returned. I could feel my heart racing. I brushed this off as anxiety. The further out we got, the more I wished I still had my car; I would have to find a replacement for this four-wheeler as fast as possible.

After about an hour, I arrived at the given location, except it didn't look right. There was a tipped-over car, and the house had broken windows. I turned off the four-wheeler and made sure Bacon stayed put. I could tell he wanted to follow me, but I wouldn't allow it; I probably saved his life.

As I approached the building, the feeling of impending dread washed over me. The front door had been completely torn from its hinges, and torn pillows and broken furniture littered the floor. The living room smelled like death: Which should've been my first hint to turn around. The fear coursing through my veins was enough to get me to stop and think about what I was doing.

I saw bloody shoes, pants, and blankets as I pushed forward. The blood looked old, but the smell in the building was still fresh. It was a weird mix of old and new, invading my nostrils like nothing I had ever experienced before. Curiosity and fear swelled my brain.

I made my way through the living room, taking careful steps. As I looked into each room, I took mindful breaths. Each room looked worse than the last, but I never came across a body. Not until I found the office. The room looked like something out of a crime show; the red wire was attached to dozens of pictures. The room was the worst smelling of them all, and I finally saw why. A body was slumped over the desk, it looked like someone or something had slammed the person in the back of the head. I took a deep breath and scanned the room one last time. I grabbed some of the newspapers. I wasn't thinking.

As I turned to bolt out of the room, I could hear Bacon barking outside. I ran through the house as fast as possible; I didn't stop to check any of the rooms. As my boots hit the grass, something whizzed past my ear. I heard a loud pop, and my body went into panic mode. I could barely breathe. My head snapped up, and I saw a man wearing a black and white suit. "Ma'am! Stop!" He called to me. I wasn't hearing it. I started running again; this time, I called for Bacon. Luckily he wasn't hurt.

We ran right into the woods, I didn't bother looking back, but I could hear the man calling my name. As Bacon and I continued to run, I could hear branches breaking around us. The familiar sound of my screaming filled the air. I told Bacon to keep up. I screamed for him to keep up.

The adrenaline was coursing through my veins now. Once Bacon and I hit the road, I took a deep breath and screamed. It was the loudest I have ever screamed. The beast was right there, right at the treeline. It snarled at me. Its claws dug into the dirt. The creature held a doorknob in its human hand. I tried to scream again, but nothing came out. The blood-soaked teeth of the beast had me stopped right in my tracks: That's when Bacon snarled. He had finally come back to me.

I could hear the man yelling in the distance, and that's when the creature turned and ran in the opposite direction. The ground moved beneath its feet, and dirt was kicked all over. I didn't bother to wait and see if the beast would kill the man. I had to run, Bacon and I had to run. I ran like the world was ending. I ran like my life depended on it.

After the lead, I ran back to town. Bacon and I did not stop to speak with the police. We only went back to rent a car. We tried to get back to our house, and the police were still there. We did not pull in to talk to them. After we got out of town, I stopped to take money out; I bought a used car and threw everything else away. I will never know what that creature was or who the man was. The newspapers didn't lead me to anything either, something about a giant moth. Whatever the case, I am done chasing answers.

This is Kelsey and Bacon. Thank you for hearing our story and whatever you do, stay out of the woods. I wish I [did](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/collection/186d353d-7f6d-4006-aa0e-e38746123553).

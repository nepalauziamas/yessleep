If you haven't read part 1 I highly suggest you do. A lot has happened since then, So I'll just link it for you. You can read part 1[ here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vemxsj/im_a_darkweb_courier_and_these_are_my_story_part_1/) . Anyway let me tell you about these past day, It's driving me insane.

I've read all of your comments on the last post and most of you told me not to open it. Something we have to consider though and I forgot to add the detail that this package doesn't have an address on it, nor does it have a name. It just says "To the man that supplies'' nothing else!? I'm not sure what I should do with it but I have it in my storage facility. I'll try to contact Jack and tell him that I need an address or that I will be throwing this thing out if he doesn't respond in the coming day or so. Today's story is going to be a little longer than the last one, It seems that you enjoy a longer one, so without further ado... enjoy.

I thought I'd tell you a little bit more about myself. Not that anybody asked but it will help you understand how I think better if you do know me a little.

So I'm a bit introverted which you already know. What you might also know from my general reaction about everything that happened so far. So you might have noticed that I'm a bit paranoid at times. I however like to not call it paranoia. I'd rather say that I'm extremely careful- That's a big difference! something else that you'll need to know is that I think, way too much! I like to think that my brain does most of the work, while my emotions stay out of it. But that kind of back speaks to my curiosity...

If you want to know what I look like, that I will not disclose to you due to my own safety, with me sharing these stories will make me a...let's call it target for some unwanted attention and "Friendly visits". I'm not sure what to do really I've gotten some unwanted speculators outside of my storage facility recently, first time in a few months actually. Anyway, I'm not sure what will happen, I posted the last post just before I

Now that current events are all set and you're all caught up with that, let me tell you more about my other...Clients. Let's call the next one, Miranda. Miranda you see she's one of the bigger customers I have and she pays...a lot. I'm not talking about college money, we're talking about life changing amounts of money each year. So you guys might think about my storage facility and why I have it if I'm just a courier. Well, Sometimes the pickup-day and the delivery date don't add up so, I have to keep it for a while (For an extra fee of course. No freebees). That the days don't add up rarely happens but with Miranda, It's probably once a month or so. her packages vary all the time, sometimes I'm looking at a small ring sized box and sometimes I need a whole truck just to fit the damn thing. The strange thing is that the deliveries are never to any houses or people for that matter. I leave them at the same location each time. Now I don't know what she does for a living and I get paid enough to not care so I'm not even going to speculate. But the location whom I won't put in name but I can describe it for you...Or I'll do my best at least.

This place where I make all deliveries is an old abandoned warehouse about 3 hours outside of my town. That probably doesn't tell you a lot but 2 hours from my town you haven't even passed by a major city. I think the military used to use this old warehouse for storage back during world war 2 but again, I'm not sure. Anyhow the Storage facility is overgrown and huge, I'm talking about a vehicle warehouse size and It's just empty. Sometimes I make deliveries multiple times a day for Miranda but every single time I get back there no matter how large the package is. It's always empty. I've thought about checking the place out to see who comes and picks the damn things up but as I've said before. The privacy of my customers is my priority.

Furthermore with Miranda, She's the one I know most about for some reason. She asked me for advice a few times about social events and stuff like that. Now I know I shouldn't give any advice of that sort due to my introvert nature but hey, coaches don't play right? Back to Miranda. So the things I've noticed is that she must be pretty high up socially, I mean she's going to fancy parties around the capital and other major cities in my country. She also seems to be an entrepreneur of sorts too due to her way around economics when me and her are talking business. Seems kind of weird to me but again, she pays enough to make me not question it.

Alright, it's been about a day since I wrote that last section in this post and I'm writing this from my desk trying to figure out what to do with this damn thing. I'm sorry I'm getting ahead of myself again, There's 2 major things have happened since the last post. Let's start off with...Miranda.

Now Miranda, as I said is the person I know most about, or so I thought.

This probably doesn't make sense to you but let me tell you that this got me concerned. I got a letter addressed to...Me, not "Paul" which is only the name I use in business but actually my name. addressed to me.

"HOW THE FUCK DO THEY KNOW MY NAME??"

I spat out. Now this gave me the creeps since I am very VERY serious with being anonymous. I decided to open the letter. Now this letter was nothing special. I'm not sure how to explain it, it was the most Ordinary letter I've ever seen. It's hard to even explain it. It was the most perfect non-perfect letter ever. It was written in the most beautiful cursive I've ever seen. It said:

"*To \[Redacted\] from Miranda"*

Of course it didn't say Miranda but due to privacy I'm not gonna disclose her real name.

Now this got me curious so I opened it, all it said was:

"We need to talk. I can't tell you much over this letter so meet me at "131 \[Redacted\] street 12" and I'll tell you everything, Miranda"

Now I'll tell you this really peaked my interest. In hindsight I should have just rubbed this off and dropped Miranda as a client. Yes I know I shouldn't had gone, Yes I know it was stupid even at the time of doing it, but can you blame me? Tell me right now that you wouldn't have! So my curiosity got the better of me. They say that curiosity killed the cat, and I don't believe that's just a saying at this point.

So let me get you through what happened.

04:30 AM:

I took one of the clean business cars and started driving, I obviously needed a clean car and some kind of back story to tell my parents on why I'm driving for a solid day to meet up with someone so. I just simply told them that I had a business meeting down south and had to drive down to meet with a potential supplier.

Now this wasn't all false so it was an easy lie to sell. What can I say, I've become pretty damn good at lying at this point.

07:45 PM:

So, a long day's drive. Just arrived in the city of the meet, I've haven't had time to check my phone or anything, but I'm sure I've missed a lot. I'm going to scout out the place before going in, I don't want to be surprised.

08:00 PM:

I've just arrived at the building and it's a newly built house at the coast line. Now I'm no architect but it looks damn expensive to build. The house is matte-gray with large windows covering one of the house's walls and a large garage right next to it connected to the house with a small flat roof.

Now I've scouted this place I had a pretty decent idea of what the house was and what type of area I was in. So I went in, anxious like a student before a massive test you haven't studied for. I knocked at the door.

one knock:

"What the fuck am I even doing"

Two knocks:

"Should I just leave and stop the business with her?"

Just when I was about to knock the third time a tall, blonde and pretty good looking woman opened the door. She eyed me up and down and asked "Are you Paul?" with a serious face.

"Ye-ees" I answered weakly.

"Good" she responded.

She invited me into the house and we sat down on the sofa.

"Do you know why you're here?"

She asked while not leaving my gaze.

"No? it said in the letter that everything would be explained here"

I answered with a confused face.

She looked for me a while before saying:

"So, I'll be sending a package that's very important to me"

She stood up and walked to the window gazing out at the open waters.

"Can I trust that you will take care of it?" she said bluntly.

I thought about it for a moment but before I could answer she said:

"It'll pay good. double the usual" She said and turned around looking at me.

I was stunned. Double the normal amount was insanely high so I got even more curious about what it is.

"What is it?" I asked curiously

"Nothing of your business. All you need to know is that it's very very valuable to me so I need it delivered quickly and safely, understood?"

I thought about it for a while before I answered:

"Understood" I said confidently.

She stood quiet for a while before she said.

"It's good to have someone to trust and if you do this for me, I owe you one."

We just stood silent for a while, before she said:

"I'll be in touch, I will tell you 1 day before the package arrives at yours."

I nodded and walked back to my car. When I closed the door to my car I just thought over everything that just happened before I drove home. Not a lot happened after that really and it was pretty peaceful besides well, Jack.

Now I told you in the beginning of this post that there were 2 major events that happened during these days. Well, this was the second.

So, this is where my anxiety and paranoia kicks in real fucking hard! So you guys remember that package I asked if I should open? Well, I decided not to, so I didn't get an answer from Jack about it, it was just quiet. So I decided to throw it out right before I drove down to meet with Miranda. So, you could have guessed what was waiting for me at the exact same place as I picked up that box, it was a new one that looked the same, exact same text and everything. I don't know what to do with it, I mean "To the man who supplies" what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?? I tried to message Jack again asking about that fucking package, No response again.

So, my anxiety level was at top, and I didn't want anything to do with this damn package, so I did the exact same thing as last time. I threw it out. Now what was I supposed to do with it? I mean it's not addressed to me is it? Why would it be me? It wouldn't make sense. "The man who supplies" what do I supply I'm just a damn courier! and besides that who would send me anything, they already pay for the services. That's more than enough for me. Now today, it's Friday, and Friday is supposed to be a pickup from Jack. So I drove down to the gas station and went into the handicap toilet as I usually did, but under the sink there was no envelope. It was a note and it read:

"Paul, why haven't you opened my gift? I thought you trusted me more than that. Anyway, I'd like you to go talk to the cashier, they have a how should I say it, a special offer for you. We have always been pleased with your quality of work. So we want you to do something for us"

I read the note as I stood in the toilet comprehending what I just read.

"Fuck fuck fuck, not now!" I said to myself

This wouldn't have been a big deal if it wasn't for the job that I was supposed to get from Miranda. I mean that I needed my whole attention to perform. She did say that it was very valuable for her so I certainly don't want to lose it. Who knows what she can do to me if it gets lost or damaged. I didn't want to take that risk. Anyway, back to the gas station.

I followed what the note had said. I walked up to the cashier and he looked at me with a serious face.

"Hey man, what's up?" I said with confidence.

The cashier just looked at me and nodded towards the door in the back. So I did as I was told and went into the back of the station. When I entered the back door I was greeted by 2 large dudes almost looking like your average bouncer outside of the clubs. They were huge! They closed the door behind me as I proceeded to the manager's Office.

"Thank you for coming" I heard a voice say right before I went into the office.

I turned around sharply to look at a short fat man who seemed to be around his 30's or 40's. He proceeded to usher me into the office so I assumed this was the manager. He signed me to sit down while he went and poured 2 glasses of whiskey and placed one of the glasses in front of me.

"Hello Paul, My name's Jack" he said while taking a sip of his whiskey.

"I got a gift for you old friend" he proceeded to open a drawer by the desk.

I just sat quiet waiting for him to get to the point. I had literally no idea what I should've done and I honestly don't know even after what was the right choice. Jack continued to take up a box, I recognized it right when I saw it.

"What the fuck is that" I said quite annoyed to Jack

"It's a gift" he said and placed the box on the desk on the right of me.

"I need you for something" he said with a small grin on his face.

"You're delivering packages by a competitor of mine, I'd like you to do one final delivery for her" He said with a serious face again.

"It has come to my knowledge that a package is going to arrive at your establishment," he said with a lack of a better word.

"I'd like you to take it, and put it in this box" he said while looking at me.

He finished his drink and signed for me to do the same.

"Can you do that for me?" He asked while staring into my soul.

Now I don't know what to answer to this, I'm sure that if I didn't agree I wouldn't come out of this damn place alive. So I did what any sensible person would do.

"Yes, for the right price" I said with a smirk

Jack looked at me for a solid minute with not even a blink before he spoke again.

"One million" he said, looking at me.

"Holy shit" I thought to myself trying not to show my excitement.

Now that was a lot of money I'll tell you. It was far more than what Miranda had offered me to take care of the package. This is where the internal debate began. Should I take it or should I stay true to my word with Miranda? I had no idea what to say so I just said:

"Sure thing boss" while I sat back in the chair.

Jack looked at me and nodded slowly.

"Good, we'll be in touch when you have the package" He said while pouring another glass for himself and offering me one.

I declined the extra glass and thanked him for the opportunity and left the gas station.

It's now evening and I’m sitting at my desk looking at a small box sent  by Miranda. Just staring at it trying to decide what to do. I’ll update  you all when I’ve decided what I should do. I guess  it’s going to be another long night with no sleep…

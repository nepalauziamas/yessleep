I was in my room mindlessly playing a puzzle game on my mobile. A playlist, a dear friend made for me played in the background. It was a Saturday evening and my room was illuminated by nothing but the light from the hallway. I could hear the television and my parents talking from the other room. It was normal day and I was spending it happily doing nothing. That's when I heard it. 

Ting!

A single note as clear as the day. My zoned out mind started focusing on the note. It sounded like the first note from the song pop goes the weasel. I thought nothing of it. It could have been from anywhere. Then again

Ting! 

The same note. I was surprised by the clear quality of the note. I could hear it over the television, my parents and my music. It was as if the note was played right next to my ears. I reduced the volume of my music so I could pin point the source of the note if I heard it again and kept playing the game. Nothing. I am not sure how long it took but I managed to pass three levels before I heard it again. 

Ting! 

I paused my music and game and listened keenly for the next note. At this point I was sure it was the pop goes the weasel melody and was kind of annoyed that who ever was playing it wasn't playing it completely. As I was listening I noticed something else. The sound from the television sounded muffled and I couldn't hear my parents talking anymore but I didn't thinking much about it. After all it was normal peaceful evening. After hearing nothing for two more minutes I went back to the game. 

Ting! 

I sat up straight. I couldn't hear the television anymore. There was pin drop silent. Maybe... Maybe they turned off the television. It didn't bother me much but the abrupt silence was all I could think about. I tried going back to game but I couldn't focus. The game kept showing me hints as I wasn't making any move for a long time. The silence was getting to me. I decided to check up on my parents. Silence. The hall was empty and Television was switched off. I was right. They must have left for a walk they do that and it was not unusual. However what was unusual was that they would leave without telling me. I shrugged it off and just to be sure I check the kitchen and the other rooms. Silence. I walked back to my room feeling kinda stupid. Before I walked in I poked my head into the hallway and saw my sister's room door slightly ajar with light shining out of it. Atleast she was home I thought before flopping onto my bed. I was right and everything was normal but it didn't feel like that. The silence was overwhelming. I was waiting for something. Some sort of noise. The note. 

Ting! 

I shot up from my bed and rushed to the hallway. As if it knew where to look my eyes automatically landed on my sister's room. It was dark. The light was off now. I quickly walked to her room not giving me enough time to overthink the situation and pushed the door wide open. Nothing. I shuddered involuntarily and yelled out for my parents. 

"Ma!"

Nothing

"Pa!" 

Silence

This was normal I tried convincing myself. Maybe they all went for a walk. They just didn't tell me or they did tell me and in my zoned out state I just didn't pay attention. That is entirely possible. I just have to go back to my room and call them. Yes that is what I have to do. I walked back to my room briskly before but I could reach my room... 

Ting! 

I froze on the spot and held my breath. Seconds later I heard it. A song. It was playing on my phone. It wasn't even the song  I paused on. Was someone in my room? Was this all a stupid prank? I stood therein the hallway not daring to move an inch. I stood there praying for my parents to walk in through the front door. I stood there praying for the song to just stop. I just stood there. 

Ting! 

My sister's room's door shut with so much force behind me that I felt the floor vibrate. I ran into my room and closed the door behind. I didn't care if there was an intruder in my room. In fact I would have been glad that atleast someone was there. I locked the door behind me and stared at the door waiting for someone to break in. Nothing. I grabbed my phone and tried to stop the song but I couldn't. I tried the pause button, closing the application and reducing the volume. Nothing. The music kept on playing. I tried to ignore it and call my parents. No service. 

This has to be a nightmare. This is not normal. I paced around the room not knowing what to do but I knew I had to do something. Before the... The note. I threw open the curtain in my room and opened the window that directly faced our neighbour's window. Even if they were not home atleast someone would hear me. I had to pier off the mosquito net that was stopping me from opening the window. I could almost hear the note coming and I had to do something before that. I managed to pull off the net and opened the window. Nothing. It was pitch dark. It was as if I was staring into the void. I stumbled back ready to cry when I heard it. 

Ting! 

I gasped audibly waiting for the something to happen. I didn't know what was going to happen but I knew something was going to happen. I stood in the middle of my room breathing heavily. 

Thump! 

The music from my phone stopped. I backed up to the wall far away from the my door. Someone was knocking on my bedroom door. Not knocking. It sounded more like a slap as if whoever was outside hit the door with their open palm. 

Thump! 

Thump! Thump! Thump! 

I started crying but I didn't let it stop me from calculating my next move. I had to do something. I looked around the room and I knew that there was nothing that could help me. I grabbed the vase that was on my table and ran inside the bathroom shutting it behind me. I was just cornering myself but there was nothing else I could do. I didn't even know what I was running away from. I wiped away the tears and sweat that was making my sight blurry. In flight or fight my body automatically choose flight now there was no other place to run. I had no other option. Nothing. 

My heart was pounding and the room felt small. It was getting hard to breathe but I tried my best to be silent. I waited and waited and waited. Nothing. Exhausted I sat on the toilet lid trying my best to control my breath but I couldn't. Soon I started struggling to breathe. I had to leave the room, I thought. I must have sat there for more than a hour I am not sure. In the meantime nothing changed I was still in the dark cold bathroom waiting for something to happen. It was only getting harder and harder to breathe and I was sweating profusely. It was pitch dark and the silence was deafening. 

I stood up slowly and walked towards the door. I gently pressed my ears to the door hoping to hear something. Anything. Nothing. Taking in a deep struggled breath I opened the door and walked into my room. The room felt small, dark and stuffy. I started wheezing at this point. I should run out of the house. Yes. I gripped the vase tightly and threw open the door. Nothing. I tried to run to the main door but I couldn't. I was exhausted and getting more and more tired by the passing seconds. I managed to drag myself towards the door. Escape, I thought but no. The door was locked. I dropped to the ground giving up. I couldn't breathe at all. I am dying I thought. Or I am already dead and this is hell. That's when I heard it. 

No note. 

No music. 

No knocking. 

Loud painful wailing. My family. Their pained voice gave me the strength I needed. I had to save them. I had to get out. With whatever remaining strength I tugged on the door hard. I tried to scream but nothing came out as my throat strained. The walls started caving in. No matter how many times I wiped off the tears, my sight remained blurry. I was being crushed and I couldn't do anything. I threw myself at the door I had to get to them. "Please" I said with all I had. The door was thrown open and I saw a lot of blurry figures and incomprehensible screaming before I passed out. 

Right now I am in a hospital. I was being buried alive. I don't know why and I haven't asked yet. The notes I heard were nails being hammered into my coffin. The weasel the popped out of the box was me.

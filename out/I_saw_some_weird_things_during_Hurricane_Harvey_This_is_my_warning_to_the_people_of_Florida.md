At the time of the creation of this warning, Hurricane Ian has made landfall in Florida. Today is the 29th of September, and approximately 1.8 million Floridians are without power and many are locked within the state, unable to escape.

While I may not be there now- let me express my condolences- as well as my hopes and wishes to those of you trapped in Florida.

But let me get to my warning: Don’t trust the water.
It’s not what you think it is. It isn’t water- but something else entirely. It’s a freak of nature. It’ll worm its way into your head and kill you from the inside out. For most of you, this won’t probably be an issue. But to some, specifically those closer to bodies of water you’ve got to know this.

I’m not sure exactly what it is- all we know it looks and acts like water. Living water that crushes up your organs.

Let me tell you my experience with “living water”.
Hurricane Harvey was a costly storm, and it displaced many people from their homes. Fortunately, my house wasn’t destroyed, nor even damaged. No random damages that popped up a year later either. 

During the storm, though, I stayed indoors. My house was safe, after all, and at first, I spent most of the time playing video games, writing, or calling my girlfriend- who was supposed to be living with me but was away for work.

Anyway, days had gone by with nothing but the endless torrent of rain, and by then, I’d done everything I’d needed to do, and I was literally dying from the boredom.

And then just when I thought things couldn’t get worse- I heard it- a frantic knock on my doorbell. Confused, I gingerly walked over to my door. The knocks continued, panicked and desperately trying to get in.
I drew open the blinds and peeked out the windows. There was a woman I recognized to be my neighbor- Theo.

I opened the door. “What are you doing here?!” the raging storm obscured my words. “It’s insane out there!”

“I need your help!” she exclaimed. “This- this man just knocked on my door- when I opened it he just fell in and fainted!”

Now I was even more concerned. “What?!- come in!”

Theo agreed, and I closed the door, taking refuge in my house. She instantly calmed down, now a lot dryer than before. In her haste, she’d completely forgotten to fetch an umbrella, and was drenched in water.

Water, that almost seemed to more in patterns, squares and circles, like some sort of diagram.

“What happened?” I inquired. “After the man fainted.”

“Right,” Theo continued, “he just fell. I didn’t know what else to do, so I kinda just pulled him inside and he’s lying on the floor now.”

“Can we call 911?”

“Tried,” she answered. “Phone lines are down. But there’s more.”

“More?” a strange man fainting in the rain was weird, but more?

“I don’t know if he’s aware, but the guys been talking weird. Not like talking talking- more like these noises are coming from inside him, like there’s something inside his body. It’s like…” she paused, thinking. “Like someone shoved a tape recorder inside him.”

“What do you-”

Theo retrieved her phone and showed me a video she took. The first few moments were chaotic, but eventually, it settled.

The man was in a brown suit, and a briefcase was next to him. Further, he was in a fetal position, curled up on the floor. His mouth opened- and out came this jarring metallic noise, a sound that was neither living nor dead.

And then came another noise. It was like a balloon popping. A moist, fleshy balloon. I also noted that something seemed to move below his clothes, a lumpy mass underneath the stomach.

“What the hell?” I murmured. 

“But look at the water!” Theo pressed. I looked, seeing water all over the man- but they weren’t just covering him. They were vibrating and tunneling through his suit, his clothes and- his skin.

The man on the video coughed, and out came blood, heavily diluted with water. It seemed to slosh and move around before spreading out on the floor.

“I…” No words escaped me. I was silent. This defied all reasoning. 

“So?!” Theo cut in, breaking my silent thoughts. “You’re a doctor, right? You know what to do.”

“I’m a Doctor in mathematics,” I confessed. “I’m not sure how I can help with this.”

“Damnit!” she swore. 

“My girlfriend’s the doctor,” I mentioned. “Evolutionary Biologist- she would know.” And then, just as I was deciding on letting Theo stay over under the hurricane stopped, I found myself hooked by curiosity. 

The briefcase. And further, the water? This defied explanation- and I simply needed to know.

So instead of staying safe inside my house, I decided I needed to know. “Can you take me over to your place? I want to see this for myself.”

“Uh,” she hesitated, thinking. “Sure.”

Citizens of Florida, don’t go searching for this thing. It’s not as fun as you think it’ll be. I’m looking at you, Florida Man.

Minutes later I was inside her house. Thunder and lightning lit the heavens on fire around us. Ahead lay a man in the center of her living room. Strange inhuman noises screamed out from his core, all while blobs of mass moved under his skin.

I looked around and saw individual water droplets moving in patterns around me. They were like ants. Lines upon lines and lines were all I could see.

“Living water,” I murmured.

“That wasn’t here before,” Theo pointed out. I wondered if we should go back. I don’t know why, but I stopped forward, breaking a line of water.

Theo hung back at the door, and I headed to the body. A deep bark came from the man’s body. He thrashed, and blood-red water came spewing out, just missing me by inches.

The vomited blood-water shook itself free of blood and separated itself into individual ant-dots and began follow the lines.

I traced the lines with my eyes. They all seemed to lead into a drain, whether it be a sink, a tub or even a toilet.

“ST,” I whispered, reading the logo on the briefcase. I stepped forward and picked it up when-

“Watch out!”

I turned around- and suddenly found myself wet with blood. The dying man had just vomited on me, and sticky, almost-coagulated blood was all over me. Worse, it was moving, crawling all over my clothes-

“Ow!” 

They were drilling into my skin.

It hurt like hell, and, grabbing the briefcase, I stumbled back and fell. Like vultures to a corpse the ant-drops suddenly starting running towards me, and everything started to feel like needles, all over my body.

And yet, with every ounce of my strength I picked myself back up, and ran out into the rain- taking Theo out with me, and headed into my house.

When I got in, I suddenly realized I was thirsty- extremely thirsty. As if I could drink all the water in the world- even the blood-red moving water seemed enticing.

“Are you okay?” Theo questioned. “What the hell are those things?”

“No idea,” I gasped, out of breath. My throat started to hurt. I coughed. “I need- water.”

Theo nodded, running off to the kitchen to get some. Meanwhile, I opened the briefcase, revealing two sections. One was covered in a lid, securing two vials of… water in place.

The other section was enclosed in a zipper, and I opened it, taking out pieces of hastily stapled paper.
The papers seemed to detail something about ice cores and something else found in the ocean that had to be recovered before the hurricane messed things up. That something being a creature native to the depths of the Gulf of Mexico.

A creature that wasn’t solid, no, not like us. A living liquid entity, intelligent like a crow and cruel as mankind. 

“Living Water,” I read, “-name undecided, was discovered last month. A group of scientists studying local marine life stumbled upon a moving, especially blue part of the ocean, which began to circle fish and crush them.
A sample was quickly recovered. It appears to have the ability to survive on land- in fact, it seems more effective on land than in water. It drills holes into its prey and dehydrates it. 

Prey then drinks water- and the Living Water does something remarkable- it reproduces, transforming regular water into Living Liquid. I’ve retrieved two vials to be sent over to Shepherd Technology.”

I saw drawings of the two vials.

I looked back at the two vials. The water inside seemed alive, crawling and moving and-

I felt something twist inside me, and I opened my mouth to scream- but only a deep metallic noise came out. The water was inside me, killing me from the inside.

I saw a lumpy mass move under my skin, and this time, 

I screamed as it moved. I felt it wrap around something inside me, and again, a strange, alien noise emitted from my core.

“What happened?!” Theo shouted, confused. “It- the water- it’s-”

“I know!” I weakly exclaimed. My mind was racing- all my thoughts pointed to a single objective: SURVIVE. I started to think of ways to live- maybe vomit the water- but no, it was somehow preventing me from doing so. 

“I have your water-” Theo reminded- and then it hit me. I was still dehydrated- a result of the Living Water inside me. Maybe in the ocean it could reproduce freely, easily killing its prey.

But on land- of course- if I dehydrated myself then maybe- just maybe-

“Don’t give me the water!” I screamed. “Don’t! I need to stay dehydrated-it’s the only way to stop it-”

The water inside me crushed something, and a bizarre noise emerged. Theo nodded, returning to remove the water. 

And then everything after that is a blur. Everything was hot. Everything was cold. I started to see things. I don’t really know what exactly happened besides that I desperately wanted to drink water.

And by sheer willpower, I didn’t.

Then the next thing I remember is throwing up. Water gushing out of like a waterfall. I felt the slimy crawl of the water through my esophagus and drain out of me, gone, gone onto the floor and splitting into ant-droplets that traveled to the sink, vanishing down the drain.

At last, I was able to drink water. That was the greatest feeling in my life. And the last I saw of the droplets was a final, single drop, leaving. But not through the sinks and drains- but through a window, drilling through the glass and escaping out in the wild, joining the chaos of the hurricane.

It didn’t start from the hurricane, no- but from the depths of the ocean. But now it’s here. It hunts with the hurricane. 

I know the droplets that entered the drains were all dealt with. As soon as the hurricane was over the water system was shut down as a result of a “chemical failure”, and was back up the following day.

The man in the suit vanished too. I let Theo stay over until the storm was over, and when we finally got back to her house- all evidence of the man and the Living Water was gone.

In recent years I’ve started to read the news, and I’ve seen some strange deaths from the aftermath of a hurricane- people dehydrated and dead. You’d think with all the water they’d at least be hydrated.

But that last drop escaped, and by now, who knows how many it multiplied into. Hundreds? Thousands? Millions?

All I know is that it hunts with the [hurricane](https://www.reddit.com/r/JulianPageInstitute?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

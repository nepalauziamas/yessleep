Having a pilot's license in the 1980s gave me many opportunities. The most lucrative of them were not within the bounds of the law. Most of my free time was in the sky. I carried packages of a certain white narcotic that was in high demand. 

I spent my free time in Miami. The limitless amount of cash afforded me the best clothing, drinks, and jewelry. I also met my fair share of women at that time in nightclubs. 

If I was smart I would have maintained a low profile. My mindset at the time was juvenile. 

"When you see an opportunity to be flashy," I told a fellow party-goer, "why not indulge in that decadence?" 

I knew that one day you were King, and the next you’re in the poorhouse working a dead-end job - or worse, in the penitentiary.

I had to let loose while not at work since I had a few close calls back then. There were times when I landed in Colombia and believed I would never make it out. I never snitched on any of my superiors or equals. This is why I still have a pulse today. When they thought I may have been culpable of ratting on them, I had to clear my name. I always did.

The kind of assignments I undertook was easy for me. For starters, I was a great pilot. I am also of Hispanic descent, and I have no problem fitting in with the populace over there. I rarely raised any red flags.

Some may speculate how facing near-executions should have been a wake-up call to flee to a place far away. 

What the person on the outside looking in does not know is how good the adrenaline rush feels. The natural high you get when you are living on the outskirts. and working against the system the way I did. The outlaw lifestyle is one of the most addictive elements on earth. This is especially true when it is abundant.

Around December of 1993, I did decide to take a long hiatus. In my mind, I was not giving up the life. The notion of retirement was nauseating. I thought about putting the brakes on the entire operation was a good idea. 

The highest boss at the time had died on a rooftop in his home country with a bullet to the back. I did not trust anyone to take his place. I did not believe a new leader would be anywhere near as profitable for his subordinates.

One day I sat in my apartment watching television.

The phone rang and I answered.

The voice on the other end was hoarse. He sounded as though he finished chain-smoking twenty packs of Pall Malls.

“We know you stole one of our bricks,” The man said. “I went to one of the *brujas*. I had him give you a little karmic present. Enjoy.”

I hung up and tried to forget the conversation, though I knew it was a sign I had to move.

I bought a cabin away from society. It was in the mountains. The views surrounding the estate were breathtaking. In the first six months, I was there, I felt a bit isolated, but I knew it was for the best. I had an escape route mapped out if the authorities were to ever circle the place. 

Tapping my phone was impossible considering I did not have a phone. 

I watched old westerns on VHS and read thriller novels during my downtime. I fished, hiked, and hunted every other free moment. 

I still grew deathly bored. To go from having your heart racing every single day to living like Thoreau is a culture shock.

I kept copious amounts of cash buried around the perimeter. It was in everything from shoe boxes to milk crates with pieces of wood placed over their tops. There were no witnesses to watch me shovel in the remoteness.

There were stacks of bills stuffed into my mattress, so I rarely had to resort to unearth the currency. I grew out a beard and dyed it a color I never had before. I went into the nearby town and stocked up on everything from top ramen to Blue Label scotch. 

A month after the booze had run out, I searched my bed for more money and found I had tapped that particular reserve. I grabbed a shovel and went out back. 

I dug up one of the boxes and brought it inside.

As I laid out the money on the floor, one discolored bill, in particular, caught my attention. It did not even resemble a typical Franklin. 

Upon closer inspection, I saw the bill had dried blood. A symbol was on it. The mark appeared to be similar to that of a corporate logo, but one that was completely unknown to me. 

I was willing to wager it was unrecognizable to most everyone. It looked as though someone tried to remember how to draw a pentagram and failed.

I knew I could not spend it in town without attracting attention, So I threw it in my wastebasket. 

I left, purchased the necessary liquor in town, and came back.

\*

I awoke in the middle of the night to the sound of rustling. I sat up and stared at where the noise was coming from. It was in the corner of the room, where the wastebasket was. In the darkness and drowsiness, I contemplated how it was more than likely a rodent.

Something seemed out of place when I opened my eyes a little more. The rim of the wastebasket had unusual shading around it. It seemed as though someone had painted it with a dark and inky liquid. 

I stood and switched on the lamp. 

The wastebasket looked normal in the light. 

I shrugged and thought it was a result of exhaustion. I had spent the day splitting wood. 

I turned the light off, got back into the bed, and rolled over.

I slept well and did not wake up until seven hours later. When I went to stand, I saw a shadow on my wall. It was humanoid and held a staff. I saw the shadow entity shake the object in the air. It unnerved me so much that I even ran my hand along the wall, where it dissipated.

\*

I spent the morning trying to shake off the feeling of interminable doom which had befallen me. I made coffee, eggs, and bacon. As I was frying my food to start the day, I heard a loud pounding noise. It came from the eastern part of the cabin. 

I sat my utensils down and went into my room. I reached for a very large mag light and knife. I also grabbed a pistol.

I held the blade downwards and crept towards the persistent noise.

I crouched and waited for someone to crash in through the window. I knew it was likely not a lawman, since they tended to announce themselves. I reasoned it was a stray or an adversary. Remembrances of news headlines about a serial killer being active in the area came back to me. 

I stared at the wall for a long time. There was no silhouette through the shuttered casement. The ruckus ceased altogether.

With the gun clutched, I went outside and searched for footprints. 

What I found instead horrified me.

Dismembered animal carcasses were everywhere. The limbs of elk and the bloodied, severed claws of bears were strewn about. 

I gazed at some of the crimson stumps as the hair on my arms stood up. Whoever had done this had wielded a hatchet with more brute force than precision.

I circled the cabin and did not see any trace of a human. I contemplated how it was almost as though someone had dropped the parts off from a plane.

I scaled a nearby hill to get a better look at the uppermost part of the structure. There were streaks and wide swaths of blood coating the rooftop.

I shoveled the animal remains into mini trash bags. The smell was abominable. I tied them off and kept them many yards away from my house. I knew predators would come in the night to feast on the collection. 

I thought of the possibility of this not being a targeted event. I knew about the kind of damage that flocks of geese could do to an engine, but this was beyond inexplicable. My mind went through scenarios of exotic animals transported via aviation to dictators. Something could have gone wrong with the latches. 

It seemed like a silly hypothetical at the moment, but I was trying to calm myself down with an explanation. Even if done on purpose, I could not figure out who would complete such a thing and why.

\*

My head pounded. I went inside and laid down. I felt myself drift off to sleep. I heard a brief scratching noise which I dismissed as a tree limb scraping against the rain gutter. 

Drowsiness overcame me, and I saw something protrude in the corner of my left periphery. 

I looked over. Spider legs the size of batons emerged from the waste basket.

I awoke screaming and sweating. I glanced over and saw that the wastebasket was normal. I wiped my brow and kicked my feet over the edge of the bed. I took in a few deep breaths. I stood and paced.

I picked up a paperback and read a few passages. I decided to give sleep another go, faithful another night-terror would not fall me.

Darkness whirled around me as I melted into the embrace of slumber.

I was in my cockpit. The earth below rushed towards me as divided squares of land. I was in the beginning stages of a crash. All I heard was my voice screaming out the word mayday. I knew it was futile, a result of training-based instincts and desperation. 

The sweetness of jet fuel, singed flesh, and flames greeted me in an instant.

Scorched metal, debris, and burnt pieces of electronics sunk into my skin. I wanted to shout for help, but my voice grew muffled in the enveloping swarm of land and wreckage. The disassembled morass of ruined parts flowed around me in rivers of sparks.

I crawled out of what looked to be a narrow prism which I widened with what little ounce of strength I had left. My skin peeled off as I trudged through the dirt and grass. 

I cranked my head around to look at the ruined plane. The same sigil which was on the hundred-dollar bill I had thrown away was visible on the side of the aircraft. 

I yelled out at the lowering sun before I awoke again.

When I sat upright, my hand graced something cold. I looked down. The wastebasket was right next to where I had lain. 

I got down on my knees and threw up into it. I had to destroy the symbol. Before the night was over I would fish it out and burn it. My decision felt superstitious. Still, my suspicion of the source of bad luck was undeniable.

\*

It has been many decades since that last nightmare. I have never had a repeat of that one. I have had anxiety-inducing ones about planes crashing into me. They occur in isolated and peaceful settings.

Another unusual change in my life has been the continual presence of spiders. I have already hired an exterminator to come out and try to rid me of the nuisances, to no avail. They lurk in my cabinets. They are beneath my floorboards and in the cracks of every piece of furniture. I am always at war with them, though I am armed with a bountiful amount of insecticides. They crawl on me when I dare pass out. 

The dead animals also became a recurring incident. Something always took them away in the night whenever I put them in bags.

Some may envy me for my reclusive lifestyle and my lack of typical responsibilities. If they only knew the true hell I live in, with the constant worry of how many animal bodies I’ll have to clean up the next day and how many visions of obliteration I endure. 

They would not trade their normalcy for my existence if they only knew.

I still see the shadow of the man who likely cursed me. When I go into town, I see the same symbol. Sometimes it is a piece of graffiti on a bus bench. Other times it is an ornament hung on a cab driver's rear view mirror. It taunts me.

This morning I walked out and saw words written in blood on my front door, likely with a sharp end of a stick:

*Vivirás en el mundo que creamos para ti.*

*You will live in the world we create for you.*

My wife and I own a gas station. We only open at day time because a while back the worker who worked at night got robbed while my wife and I were sleeping (it is worth mentioning that our gas station is almost 30 minutes away from the nearest police station and is in a low populated area). So given the circumstances we decided to only open it at day time. One friday night at 2:25 am while I was up watching TV and drifting to sleep next to my wife who is dead asleep, my phone rang. Which was truly weird since I rarely get any phone calls that late at night. I reluctantly sat up and checked my phone closely to wake myself up since it could be an emergency of some sort. It was an unknown number. I instantly got up and cleared my throat getting ready to receive some bad news since nothing good ever happens after 2 am. It was a muffled voice with a loud siren howling in the background
-"Hello is this Mike(my name)?"
-"Yes I'm mike" I reply with fear of what to come.
-"Sir there has been an accident, a drunk driver was speeding and hit one of your gas pumps which got the gas to ignite and we need you to come down to the gas station to talk to you about the situ.."
"I'm on my way, thank you for informing me" I cut him off before he can finish the sentence.
Within 30 seconds I told my life what had happened and was in my car driving down the highway, and after the longest 35 minutes of my life I arrive to the gas station to nothing. Not a single person in sight, everything was okay, no police, no sirens, no fire department and most importantly no car Lodged into any of the pumps.
Pissed off and fully awake now I try to call my wife to inform her about what happened and how it was a prank call or if somebody is fucking with me to get me all the way down to the gas station as a prank which was not very funny. The phone rings and rings to no answer so I check my watch and frustratingly say to myself "it's 3:08 there's no way she went back to bed so soon especially after receiving news like this". So I call again to make sure she's okay, second time no answer, third time to answer, fourth time the line connects and the first words that come to my mouth are "Are you okay?" to my surprise I hear sirens and the same muffled voice asking me if this is Mike. I loudly gasped and looked at the screen to make sure that I'm calling my wife, It was my wife's name and number on the screen. I hang up immediately scared that something bad might have happened to my wife who is home alone with my 2 y/o son. I didn't want to call the police since for all I know this could be a prank. And honestly what could've I told them "my wife is possibly pranking me can you check on her and my son"? No way, So not knowing what to do I called the unknown number that called me the first time to confirm if this is a prank or if I need to be worried, since it was about the time when a prank should end, So I expected laughter the second the line connects. To my surprise the line was disconnected and no longer in use. Confused, frustrated and tired I tried to call my wife again to make sure that I'm not losing my mind, the second I hear a siren sound come out of the speaker I hang up and try again to show that this isn't funny anymore and I'm tired of playing that game. I get back in my car and drive home while dialing my wife's number over and over again to the same damn siren sounds, for over 10 times that happened, I got Terrified out of my fucking mind, I couldn't take it anymore and my hands started shaking.. Out of fear? Anger? I had no idea at the time. After an even longer 35 minutes to get back home and slammed the door open, I never felt more terror in my life when my wife came out of our bedroom telling me where I've been and to keep it down since my son is sleeping. I don't remember anything after that.
I woke up in a hospital, they told me that that night my body must have gave out because of how tired I must have been and that I was sweating like I ran a marathon.
I don't know what happened that night, but I will  never forget it.

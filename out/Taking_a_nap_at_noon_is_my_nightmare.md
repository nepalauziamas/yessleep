Iâ€™m lived in Vietnam,an asian country which have a lot of cultures and customs,and taking a nap at noon is an important part of its. While in most western cultures napping is widely reserved for the elderly or small children.But in Asia, napping is a habits,a custom; from what I have observed, it is part of the Asian culture. Walk into any Asian company around lunch time and you are met with employees reclining on their chairs getting a moment of shut eye. Students will reserve part of their lunch time to nap before afternoon classes; this practice is a common custom in much of  asia, with people getting used to this habit from childhood.My family, a model Asian family, also follows the habits that ancestors left for their descendants.

Everything was going very well until I reached the age of 14, where nightmares began to haunt me during my naps. To be honest, I've never had a nightmare ever, at most ,stay up all night after the horror movies. The story begins one lunchtime, when I just got home from school, I was pretty exhausted. I sat down at the table and ate the worst meal I could think of. No one was at home, the meal just have meat, rice and especially vegetables, which I absolutely hate for lunch ever. Then I rushed to my bedroom and lay down on the bed in an exasperated and tired mood. I remember it was around 12 o'clock,  the time when the sun shines through the window most intensely. I quickly closed the curtains, turned on the fan and went to sleep. In just a minute, the sound of the fan and the cool breeze gently put me to sleep peacefully. But that was just the beginning of my nightmare. I  remember that the dream took me to a school, a school that I have not and will never go to.  There, I met a boy, whose name is Marcus.  Marcus is a boy about 12-13 years old.He have a 
wavy hair, yellow skin, fair skin, the freckles of puberty and a devilish smile.  He showed me around the school.  But when we reached the second stairs, he suddenly disappeared, the space was engulfed in a dark color, in my mind I only thought of that smile, the devilish smile of a demon disguised as a human. When I'm cornered, the most desperate is when I suddenly wake up. My mind is blank, vague and indescribable. The only thing left in me is that smile, the smile that makes me haunted for a long time.

Since then, I never took a nap again, no matter how sleepy I was, I still tried to endure it. But whatever happened, on a cool windy afternoon, I decided to play League of Legends to dispel the sleepiness. But then, the gentle breezes through the window also defeated me, I collapsed and fell asleep. This time, it took me to an ancient apartment complex, surrounded by gloom, deserted, and uninhabited.Then,only a howl or the sound is a tree rubbing against each other also made me feel like my soul left my body. Suddenly there was a sound of footsteps coming slowly, I was already scared, now I'm even more scared. Next, the footsteps kept walking to the rhythm of 1 2, and finally, the door opened, the shape of a demon also gradually appeared, in his hand was a bloody  sickle as if he wanted to eat me alive. Half of its face was gradually revealed, a scary face filled with resentment directed towards me, and luckily, I woke up before that damn sickle cut  in my neck. And after waking up, I saw in my corner of the house a silhouette of a girl in white facing the corner of the wall, I was so scared that I couldn't move and could only recite sutras.The pitiful cry began to resound in my mind,after a few minutes,it  disappeared, everything went back to normal like nothing ever happened, I breathed a sigh of relief and promised myself never to nap again until my house moved to another place, where I can really sleep a peaceful, relaxing naps.

Before leaving, I also asked the owner if anything had happened here, only to find out that the previous owner of this house, the sister of the current owner, had hanged herself in the corner of the house that I have seen before. However, that is only the story of the white ghost, and the story of Marcus and the demon with the bloody sickle will forever be a mystery.

When you hate somebody, it's actually good. Hate powers you to fight. Which I would need to do if I was going to live. And I wanted to live in order to hate. So I could make the Overseer pay for what happened to my brother. It would start today. The Overseer would come. Then I would leave, on the whales, just like my brother did before he had disappeared. 

My last meal with my mother was going to be a meager one. I finished cleaning the mushrooms and pushed them away and looked over the other plates. Small bread slices huddled in a basket. Slivers of butter alone on a dish. A squid lifeless on a cutting board. All its tentacles missing, but two. 

My mother handed me a knife. "What do we do with the eyes, Connell?"

"We don't eat them," I said. 

I glanced at her necklace, a hammer, the symbol of our faith. My mother was a priestess and wanted me to learn the old ways.

"Right," she said. "And?" 

"We save the eyes for the gods," I said.

"Why?" she asked. 

"So they may watch our trials in this life and aid us in our needs." 

She nodded to the squid. I slashed with my blade and its eyes lopped over and jiggled, free from the head. I set them aside, carefully, for the gods.  

There was a knock at the front. I turned and saw my stepfather open the door. My stomach boiled with hate. It was the Overseer. Fergus. A strange man. I was reminded of that right away. Overseer Fergus's head was always tilted up. Bandages clamped his fingers together. When he moved his robes sloshed around him like waves. 

My mother shouted at the men and marched over.

"Don't do this,” she pleaded. “Not after what happened with my other boy. Not after he left with the whales and never returned. By the gods, I know he wasn't the only one."

But my stepfather shook his head. Then he called me to the door and I walked over. Overseer Fergus grinned. His teeth sharpened into pointy tips. I took a step back. The Overseer laughed. He put his bandaged hand over my shoulder. I felt it heavy against me. Slime wet my shirt. And something beneath the bandages scraped me. I felt the tear of my skin and touched my shoulder. Fergus noticed. His eyes darkened with pleasure. 

"You're going to be leaving with Overseer Fergus," my stepfather said. "When I was your age I went to the countryside to work the fields. Now it's your turn, boy. You'll be leaving on a whale for the deep seas. The mines down there is the best way to make coin for a lad these days. Which we sure need." 

Footsteps stomped the floor. I turned and saw my mother storming off, wiping away a tear, her hammer necklace swinging.  

I sulked along with Fergus to his carriage. He pushed me in and I slumped onto the carriage floor, balling myself into a tight-packed space, among the crowd of kids. Then Overseer Fergus slammed the door shut. Boys and girls piled atop each other on the seats. I glanced around. A skinny girl with olive skin. A blonde-haired kid with a stubby nose. A zit-faced boy whose knobby knee bounced into my neck with each and every rut in the road. The girl across from me pushed the boy’s annoying knee away. I looked at her. Red hair, round eyes, a warm expression. 

"I think you're going to make it through this," she said. 

I only stared. 

She smiled. Then squinted back tears. "I'm not so sure about the others." 

The horses snorted and the carriage skid to a stop. Overseer Fergus unbolted the door and pried it back. A boy's shoe thudded over my thigh. Then it was my turn to crawl out. 

A chill blew in from the water. The smell of sickness crept with it and I knew something was wrong. I hopped down to the dock and saw them. The whales. Heavy iron rings cut through their noses. Chains shackled the long carriages to their backs, running rusty across their skin, atop scars from the wear of rough waters. Their eyes stared, empty and sad. Their big, broken bodies lay there, beside the docks, stirring with the waves. They were the most pitiful creatures I’d ever seen. 

Suddenly I heard a booming splash and I swung around. It was yet another whale. It soared high over the ocean. And everything about this whale was different. I felt it right away. This whale’s spirit crashed the air around us, nasty and eerie, like breakers in a storm. Its lips gnashed into a snarl. Rivers of blood poured down through its sharp teeth. A seal's half-eaten tail flipped out the corner of the whale’s mouth. The whale’s eyes bulged with fury, as its leathery body spun, then cracked across the water. 

I noticed the red-head girl beside me. The one who'd moved the knee from my neck. 

"I'm Gallia," she said. "I didn't get your name." 

I looked back across the other whales. The sad ones, bound in chains.

"They seem so lifeless," I said. "All except that gruesome whale that jumped up." 

Gallia frowned. "They weren't always like that. Something happened to them." 

Overseer Fergus pushed a boy along at the end of the dock. The furious whale surfaced ahead of them both, with the brine bolting up, splattering over its grainy skin. Its eyes seemed to lock on me. I felt a shiver of fear and glanced back to Gallia. 

"I'm Connell," I said. "Named after my grandfather. A priest of the temple, like my mother."

"Is your father a priest too?" she asked. 

"No, he's dead. And my stepdad turned his back on the old ways. Nothing good going to come of that." 

I looked down the dock and saw the Overseer. And the scary whale. But nothing else. Not the boy. The boy who'd been there was gone.

"You see what just happened, Gallia?" 

"No," she said. 

"The boy at the end of the dock. One second he was there with Overseer Fergus. Now he's disappeared." 

"Maybe he's already in a whale carriage. They're starting to board, you know." 

"I think Fergus fed him to that bloody whale," I said. 

"Don't say things like that. Don't bring attention to yourself." 

I waved my arms and shouted to the kids around me. "Hey, the Overseer fed a boy to the bad whale!" 

Gallia grabbed at my arms and yanked them lower. "Shut your mouth and keep your head down if you want to get through this."

I searched across the crowd for a dockhand who could help. I saw several guys unloading fish farther down.

I started walking toward them and shouted. "A boy disappeared!" 

One of the workers turned and I yelled louder. I raised my palm to call attention. Then a hand smacked my head from the back. I fell to the dock boards. I wiped blood from my ear and looked up. Overseer Fergus leaned down. His eyes squinched fiercely. He huffed angrily. I smelled putrid fish on his breath. Overseer Fergus hooked me up by my shirt. I struggled against his strong grip, tightening around me, like clamping jaws. I knew in that moment that Fergus had killed my brother. The death was no accident. This was the murderer. Overseer Fergus bore his sharp teeth. 

"Connell, you coming?" Gallia called. "It’s our turn to board."

Fergus glanced at her and pushed me toward the line of kids waiting to enter the whale carriages. 

I hiked up the steps, passed through the tight-packed passengers, and found a rope to hang on to. The carriage had no windows. The only light was from the door. I saw heads and arms tussling in the darkness. I thought I made out Gallia on the far side, but couldn't be sure. Then the door pounded shut and I saw only black.

The air smelled salty and dank. Chains clanged outside and the carriage swayed with the whale's choppy movement. Shoes slipped over the floor. Dozens of kids started groaning and crying from motion sickness. There was a splatter and the foul stench of vomit swept the chamber. I felt a shift and grabbed tighter to the rope. Water splashed outside and I was sure we'd submerged.

The carriage walls creaked and everything around me started to angle down. Somebody in front of me lost their grip and flew up with the momentum and hit my nose. I heard a thud behind me. Other kids were tossing toward the rear. Screams echoed back and forth. 

A loud pop came from the carriage ceiling. A second pop burst from the wall. Then another. They sounded like stags butting antlers. But worse. The carriage whipped, as though the whale had swung, and more bodies thunked around. The screams hollered at higher pitches. My stomach knotted with fear and I said a prayer and crossed my chest with the mark of the old gods. The chamber shook. I heard the fierce swish of something large outside. Then we started moving faster again. 

An arm looped around my shoulder. Long hair brushed my face. 

"Is that you, Connell?" It was Gallia's voice. 

"How did you find me?" 

"You’re the fifth person I've tried," she said. 

"What were those noises?" I asked. 

"A giant squid attacked. The wild whale fought it off." 

"The other ones can't fight, can they? They're broken." 

"What of it?" she said. 

"It's because they were tamed?" I asked. 

Gallia's tone turned cold. "Some say they tamed us." 

"What?" I blurted. “Tamed us? That makes no sense.”

"Dark things happened to those animals,” I said. “It's in their eyes." 

The whale slowed to a stop. Waves swished outside. Then the carriage door banged open and Overseer Fergus peered in. Kids began to file out. I walked onto the steps and glanced around. We'd surfaced in an undersea cavern. Rocky walls wrapped around us. Musty, heavy air filled my lungs. The clink of metal scraping stone echoed in the distance.

Overseer Fergus lead us to a pair of guards assigning work. And work was what I did. Sixteen hours straight, every cursed day for weeks, months. Time stretched on till I lost count of everything but the injuries. The kinks mauling my back from shoveling rubble. Blood drenched skin falling from my hands from hauling loaded carts. The strains ripping through my shoulders swinging a pickaxe. I fought through them all. My muscles chiseled into granite. My palms hardened to iron ore. And I cut my tattered clothes to a loin cloth. The clothes had been my only possession. They changed, my appearance changed, my life changed. The thing that remained the same was my thoughts. My feelings for my dead brother. My anger, depression, my hate. I kept them to myself, up all night, sitting on the cold gravel, head low, pounding punches into the rock. 

Then one morning the work stopped. I reported to my shift like any other. I spent the first hour tossing buckets of water against a boulder, to loosen away debris. When I went up for another cart, I noticed a girl gone.

She had been by a wall chipping with a pick. The pick lay in the dirt. I saw light reflect from the ground, past the pick’s handle, at the mouth of a tunnel. I knelt and felt slimy pebbles. Wet like when Overseer Fergus scraped my shoulder. 

I walked down the tunnel. The path angled steep. I listened carefully. I had been told deeper parts of the cave go back into the ocean. I took a big step down and saw light in the distance. I hurried. The sound of splashing water came from an opening by the light. A girl's voice shouted. 

I ran toward the noise and into a large chamber. Overseer Fergus stood, on a ledge, in the distance. He gripped the girl. She was still yelling. He headbutt her, knocking her toward a drop off. She spun back, flailing her arms. Then she slipped. And fell. Her hair bounced up. Her shriek rang out. 

A massive splash swooshed past the ledge. Giant jaws lunged high and snapped around the girl. The vicious whale twisted in the air, her legs dangling out its mouth, her blood spraying around its head. The whale’s eye locked onto me. I felt its stare, furious and eerie. 

Then the Overseer swiveled around, toward the chamber’s entrance, looking for me. Almost like he'd been told I was here. Like the whale communicated to him in some devilish way. I grumbled at the thought. Overseer Fergus sprinted right for me. 

I turned and ran. My shoes crunched across the path. My lungs filled with the foul cavern air. I heard Overseer Fergus behind me, shouting, bolting up the tunnel. The big man moved fast. Too fast. Unnaturally fast. His steps thudded close. *How?* I wondered. I felt a bang at my back and flipped forward. The Overseer slammed onto me. He raised his hand, his fingers tight and flat, like a fin. Then he pounded down and thrashed my body and face. Over and over. I tasted blood in my mouth. Pain shot through me with each slap. 

"You got me," I shouted. 

"Aye, boy, gots ya all, I do," the Overseer said. "Including yer brother." 

I grit my teeth. Hate raged inside. I wouldn't let this bastard kill me. Whatever it took. 

The Overseer hoisted me atop his shoulder and walked me a ways through the mines. Then he tossed me into a cell and clanked its bars shut.  

The cell was nothing more than a box with a pit in the floor. I looked over the pit and stared down. Its jagged walls descended into blackness. The crash of waves came from its depths. 

I sat by the edge and felt the pit's cold breeze. I figured Fergus would try to kill me for what I'd seen. Afterwards, Fergus would be happy about it. Both the brothers. Which is why I wanted to live. To hate. I couldn't let my hate die. I pounded punches into the gravel. 

My knuckles were still thudding against that rocky dirt when Overseer Fergus returned the next night. I heard the cell door clink and I looked up and saw him. Fergus grinned and gnashed his pointy teeth. His eyes grew darker and he grabbed my throat with those bandaged fingers. Then the pain started. Splattering blood, torn flesh, broken teeth clicking across the stone. The dizzy jarring from the headbutts. The fiery throb of Fergus's bites. I took the torment. I was determined to live. And hate. 

Overseer Fergus finally stormed off. I lay on my face wheezing, my ribs too sore to breathe. Steps crunched over the dirt and I wondered if my wounds could get any worse with a second beating. Then I heard her voice. 

"It's me. Gallia." 

I grunted onto my side to look at her. My vision blurred from the swelling around my eyes. 

"I think I'm dying," I said. "I can't die." 

"Why not?" 

"I hate this world too much to go yet." 

"There is a way," Gallia said. 

I coughed blood. I tasted its tang on my lips. 

"I've cooked you a soup," she said. "Eat it to grow strong." Gallia reached between the bars and set down a cup. 

Steam rose from its brim. The aroma of pepper and seafood filled the air. My stomach growled with hunger. 

"What's in it?" I asked. 

"Squid eyes."  

I nearly choked. I pictured my mother wearing her hammer necklace. I heard her words. 

*Eyes aren’t for us. But for the old gods. So they may see us in this life and aid our needs.* 

"I can't," I said. 

I rolled away from the soup. 

"I don't want to carry it back. Throw it to the waves if you want," Gallia said. 

She started to walk off. Then turned. 

"You're going to live, Connell. I still believe that." 

I watched her leave. I smelled the soup one last time, then pushed it into the corner. 

An hour later Overseer Fergus threw open the door. A large metal rod hung in his hand. Its hooked blade gleamed in the low light.

I started to scuttle backward. "Nooo. Please, no. Oh no no no." 

I was determined not to die. I couldn't. I had to live. I had to hate. 

Fergus raised the harpoon and crashed it down against my leg. Then did it again. And another time. I shrieked and I didn't stop. 

I was still screaming when Overseer Fergus left. My blood drenched the rocky dirt. I saw my leg. Its flapping skin and splintered bone. The pain was so intense my stomach flipped. I dry-heaved but nothing came up. I was losing blood and had nothing left. Not even the strength to tie my loin cloth into a tourniquet.

I glanced at the soup. No more steam, no aroma of pepper and seafood, just a bug floating in the cold, goopy surface. This is it, I thought. My last hope for hate. 

I put the cup to my mouth and knocked it back. 

Immediately I felt hot. My heart fluttered and raged in my chest. Tingles ran over my body. I touched my arm. Its skin was turning tough and leathery. I nodded down to look closer at the skin and felt my head heavy. Power throbbed through my skull. It was solid as brick. Gallia had been right about the soup. Its strength charged through me. I felt amped. I wanted to fight. Even my leg clotted and the dried blood healed to a rubbery flesh. But my fingers did chafe against each other, sticky and salty, not that that would slow me down. 

I glanced up. I heard movement. Overseer Fergus marched into the room and opened the cell. He hit me fast. The sound of smacking flesh echoed and I saw the cell bars slide and blur. I was dazed. He grabbed me and pushed my face, straight down, toward the pit. I saw the darkness stretch below. The breeze gushed up around me. My foot nudged forward, at the edge, knocking away loose gravel. The chunks of dirt clacked over the rocky walls and disappeared. My heart jostled with fear. Overseer Fergus breathed a sickly fish stink at my ear. I felt his palm scrape my face, crossing my cheek, as if he wanted to hook his fingers in my mouth. I turned away from him. As he struggled, his grip loosened. It was my best chance to strike. I spun from Fergus's hands and headbutt the bastard. Strong enough to bang him back. I think that surprised us both. Broken flesh wrinkled around his nose. 

Fergus spit blood and smiled. "I know what you've done." 

I snorted and leaned forward. I lunged and headbutt him again. Fergus fell backwards against the bars. Skin flapped from his head.

I walked over to the Overseer's crumpled body. I heard him still breathing. I raised both my fists. This would be the payback for my brother. This was what my hate was good for. This was why I needed to live. 

I started to slam my fists, furiously, toward Overseer Fergus's face. Then stopped. Hard strides thunked over the gravel. Somebody was running. I spun around and saw Gallia. She eyed me, cold and strange. 

"Thank the gods, it's you," I said. "Help me tell the others." 

Gallia put her hands on my chest. "Nobody's ever going to hear about this, Connell." 

She pushed. I tripped backwards, toward the pit. My foot slipped over the edge and I dropped. I flailed my arms. Wind gushed my face. All I could see was darkness. 

Then I crashed through the sea. Salty water filled my throat. I kicked and whipped my arms through the heavy ocean. 

My fingers scratched a hard object. Coarse, leathery flesh grated across my shoulder and leg. I popped to the surface and gasped for air. Chains bobbed with the waves. A whale bumped my back. Its massive head knocked against me and pushed me up. I looked into the enormous eye and saw nothing. The animal was broken. A iron ring hung from its nostrils. All around me other whales floated in the briny water. Their deep, sorrowful moans whispered through the cavern. 

One of the whales cried louder than the others. I saw it in a pool of red cloudy waves. Fresh wounds marked its back. Another whale bit its throat and yanked. Chunks of flesh flew up. Blood squirted. The attacking whale stared at me. It was the wild killer I'd seen before. It snarled and slipped under the water. Then its massive tail flipped up and blasted down hard. 

I knew the crazy whale was coming. My chest pounded, so hard I felt my whole body beating. I struggled against a knot of air in my throat. My hands twitched with fright. I looked down at the choppy, misty waves. It was too quiet. Suddenly a powerful movement below whooshed through the water. It sucked me under with its momentum. I sniveled. The brine filled my nostrils. Its salt stung my eyes. I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t see. I flailed my arms to try to get up. My head broke through and a wave swept over me. I choked on its seawater. Then I surfaced again and hacked and saw everything darker. 

A shadow rolled over the waves around me. 

I stared up. The eerie, furious whale swooped overhead. Water dripped around its sides and plopped, everywhere, all around me. The fear dried my mouth. I sensed death in this moment. I saw the face of my mother. Her hammer necklace. Her warning not to eat the eyes. I had turned my back on the old ways. And for nothing. I would die anyway. I closed my eyes. It all went black. 

&#x200B;

I awoke to searing pain. I thrashed as hot metal dug through my nose. The stink of burning flesh and smoke singed within my nostrils and I wheezed. But something wasn’t right. When I wheezed, I heard the sound of gushing air. A lot of air. And I felt water splash over my back. Like I'd blown it from a spout. I tried to move my arm and felt myself twist in the waves. As though I flapped a fin. Then I realized I was a whale.

I glanced around the cavern. I saw a shore in front of me and looked dead ahead – at myself. My own face looked back at me. But the eyes weren't mine. They were vicious. They were the scary whale’s eyes. 

A chain clanked onto the ring that pierced my nose and Gallia stood up beside me with its chain links in her hands. 

She smiled. "You're alive, Connell. I knew you'd make it."

&#x200B;

Addendum:

I escaped and got myself a suitable body. Suitable enough, I suppose. Anyway, there’s no time now. I’ll explain later, when the tide recedes.

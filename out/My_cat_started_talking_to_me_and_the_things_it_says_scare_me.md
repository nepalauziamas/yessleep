My cat started talking to me and the things it says scares me.

Hey nosleep, I've got kind of a weird issue. My cat has started talking to me and the things it's saying are really starting to wear on me. It's been about three weeks now. It all started after my last breakup. 

\--- 

"She never loved you, you know"

I grabbed the remote from the table and stopped the Youtube video I was watching and listened intently. 

Did I just hear a voice?

I walked around the apartment looking for what could have been the source of the sound and I couldn't find anything. My phone was on silent, I only had one TV, and the only one in the house besides me was my cat Nori.

"You're not special. Just another asshole living in a shitty apartment with a shitty life."

This time I saw it. It was Nori.

I'm definitely losing it. I thought to myself.

"Did...did you just talk to me, Nori?"

The cat looked at me with its big green eyes and cocked its head to the side, as if it were trying to figure out what I was saying.

"No, no I'm just imagining things." 

I shook my head and went back to sit on the couch. I tried to rationalize it by telling myself that I was just hearing things, and eventually convinced myself that I was just imagining it.

**Listen, guys. I don't do drugs. I hardly drink. I've never heard voices before this and I am starting to get really worried.**

A few days after this I started to notice that the cat is staring at me more than usual. And not just staring, but almost glaring. It would follow me from room to room with its eyes locked on me, as if it were waiting for something.

One day I came home from work and Nori was sitting in the middle of the hallway, blocking the path to my bedroom. 

"What the fuck, Nori?" 

I said, trying to shoo the cat out of the way. But it didn't move. It just sat there and stared at me. I tried pushing it out of the way, but it hissed and swiped at me with its claws. I jumped back, surprised by the sudden attack.

"Okay, okay. You can stay there." 

Later that night, I was about to go to bed when I heard a noise coming from the living room. I walked out and saw Nori sitting on the coffee table, looking at me. 

"Hey." 

She said.

I froze. This time there was no mistaking it, the cat had definitely spoken to me. And not only that, but it sounded just like my ex-girlfriend.

"W-what are you doing?" I asked, trying to keep the fear out of my voice.

"I'm talking to you." 

It said, still in my ex's voice.

"Why are you using her voice?" 

I asked. The cat just looked at me and cocked its head to the side again. 

"Because I know how much it hurts you." 

It said, now using my mother's voice. 

"Stop it." 

I said, feeling the tears well up in my eyes. 

The cat just kept talking, using the voices of everyone who has ever hurt me, everyone who has ever made me feel small or worthless. It was like a knife twisting in my heart with every word. I had to leave the apartment and spend the night in the hotel. 

I know, it's silly. 

\---- 

It's been a few weeks now and the cat hasn't talked again since that night, but I can't help but feel like it's just waiting, biding its time. Watching me. Waiting for the right moment.

I'm not sure what to do. I've thought about getting rid of Nori, but it's almost like it knows what I'm thinking and it just sits there and stares at me, as if daring me to do it. 

I don't know what to do. I'm starting to think I'm going crazy.

What do you guys think I should do?

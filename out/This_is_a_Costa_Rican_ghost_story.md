**I believe you**

More than seven years ago, I heard about the terrifying experience of the two little neighbors next door, which, as we say in Costa Rica, "made my hair stand." The mother of the two girls left work late at night, so when I came home from mine, the little girls would come to my house for cooking lessons.

One afternoon, Melisa, the eldest—eight years old—suddenly asked me very seriously:

— Do you believe that ghosts or demons exist and that they appear to one?"

I froze at such a question, but, as I try not to lie to children as much as possible, I answered honestly:

— Well, the truth is that yes, Meli. Why do you ask?

The little girl was torn between continuing or better keeping quiet. Valeria, her six-year-old sister, encouraged her:

—Meli, tell her to see what she says!

That helped the elder girl to make up her mind.

—It's just that something very strange has been happening to me at night; No one in my family believes me. They say that they are dreams, that I am half a sleepwalker. But I know what I see, I'm not asleep! — She stated vehemently.

— Calm down, tell me what's happening to you. — I encouraged her.

She explained:

I always get up at dawn to go to the bathroom and about eight days ago, when I went down the stairs. at the end of them was a woman. She had her back to me; she is tall, very thin, with very long hair... it reaches about her knees and she is all white. She's like transparent; although the first time I thought she was my mom. When I said "mommy," she shook her head. Then I looked towards my parents' bed and saw them sleeping there. When I looked forward again, the woman was gone. That's why I haven't gone down at night anymore. But last night was different. I had to go to the bathroom and I couldn't hold it in. When I went down, I didn't see her... but when I went back up I felt like someone blew on my ear. I looked back and there she was, the same, giving me the back. Suddenly, she turned around, and she had no eyes! Just a nose and a big black mouth. She opened it and it reached almost to the end of her neck. She made a horrible noise and I felt like my soul was getting pulled. That's when I screamed and my parents got up, scared. After I told them everything, they didn't believe me; rather, they scolded me. Nobody believes me that she wants to take me and I don't know what to do! — she finished, crying.

— Well, Meli, I do believe you. The next time she appears to you, tell her: "Go away, because Jesus is with me because he loves me!" I consoled her. That seemed to calm both of them and they went calmer to their house.

I spent the whole next day worrying about them. When I came back from work, they were waiting for me very happily. In a rush, they exclaimed, "It worked, it worked!" I felt happy.

In my house, Meli finished her story: — Last night she came back. I got really scared when she opened her mouth. Feeling that she was pulling me, I told her that Jesus was with me, and do you know what happened? She let out a very awful cry and bolted out the patio door. The scream was so horrible that it even woke my parents up. They say that it was the wind through the roof tins, but never mind. Now I know she's not coming back!

Shortly after that family moved away, but since then I haven't been able to see that house like before. Is that specter still there?

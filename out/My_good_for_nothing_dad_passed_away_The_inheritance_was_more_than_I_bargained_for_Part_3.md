What do you get for the man who has everything?

I thought about that a lot growing up. Now, knowing what awaits me, I think of it again. See, now, in spite of my shitty childhood, I finally do have everything.

When mother died, I was alone. It felt like I was the only one in mourning. Even though my father lost his wife, and my brother, just like me, lost his mother, it didn’t seem to faze them. I had no one, and I struggled to cope all the while my father berated me, and my brother tormented me every chance he had.

Now, with the loss of my father, and so soon after, my brother and his family in that ‘freak accident’, I’m free. No more harassment. No more being dismissed or talked down to. In fact, For the first time ever, people are rallying around me, showing up, being supportive in the wake of my loss. I get sympathetic smiles and hugs at work. My bosses take it easy on me, my coworkers shoulder a bit of my workload while I do my best impression of trying to hold it all together….

\- and really, on some level I am.\[JC1\]

After all, how do I contain this glee?

I have to wonder. Is this what it feels like to be Mark? Loved and adored by everyone? People lining up, tripping over each other, all but beating down doors to be there? Never before have I had this many people in my corner. But all of that is just icing on the cake.

I come back into the basement, where it all started. Here’s the real prize: Mark choking and writhing, his motions a little slower, a little weaker, day after day.

**Oh yes….** The demon’s voice in my mind. As we are one, I can feel how it savors all of our interactions- but its favorites –and mine—happen right here.

“Hey there, champ,” I say. Something Dad always called him. Champ, sport, stud. Always him, never me.

For a second, the delirium clears from Mark’s eyes, and he glares at me with so much hate, and it tastes

DELICIOUS.

The painful tears leaking from his bloodshot eyes, the way he balls his withered hands into fists. Maybe, just maybe, he’s experiencing a fragment of the suffering he’s inflicted on me all these years.

“I know,” I say. Honestly, I am almost sympathetic. “This is all a shock to you. Things have never not gone your way.” I kneel down, sneering. “And now that they have, you’re a little shocked. I understand.” I nudge his face with my foot; it’s all I can do not to kick him square in the face-I could do it. I could make his skull explode like it’d taken double barrel buck shot- but that would be too quick, too merciful. Plus, I’d only get to see it happen once.

Oh well. It’s not all bad, right?

Here I am, living my best life. Mark, at feet in absolute humiliation and agony. Everyone else who hurt me dead, everyone around me warm, supportive, caring. I was a nobody. Now I’m finally somebody. As for my father? After everything he put me through, it brings me so much satisfaction to know that shitty-ass ass faced bastard is rotting in hell, suffering for all eternity. I just can’t stop smiling.\[JC2\]

…..Is that what you thought I would say?

No. My father made his choice, knowing eternal damnation would be waiting for him. He showed my brother the demon and Mark, too, made that choice. Hell is too good for the both of them.

There’s a trick to demon deals, you see. Once you make one, you’re bound to the demon forever, til the end of your natural (or unnatural) life. Of course, after you die, you’re damned to hell for all eternity. Not just you, either. Anyone you sacrifice for power, or to cheat your own death, or out of revenge—they all go to hell too, traded for you for just a few more moments in the sun.

So, Daddy set himself and Mark up for the good life by offing Mom. And Mark was all set to toss me under that same infernal bus.

But Mother and I didn’t really get a choice did we? All I can do is make the best of it. At this point, I can’t do anything for Mom. And Mark…?

This time, I do kick a little harder, cracking his feeble ribs. That sound, punctuated with his grunt of pain- it’s rather musical, really.

….Anyway, Mark is paying for his sins way ahead of schedule.

That just leaves Pops.

When you sacrifice something—someone—to the demon, Hell appears. Just for a moment, a gateway opens, and the horrid tongue of hell scoops out the victim like a kitten lapping milk, hauling them away to suffer forever. They slide down into its throat, separated into its infinite, innumerable stomachs, each one perfectly and specifically designed to digest them. It’s fascinating to watch, really. And I’ve practiced watching, you see.

I had to do it. I had to practice for what comes next, and really, no one liked Benson from accounting anyway. So, two weeks ago after I spilled some sob story about missing my brother, he took me out to the pub, and well, when that pretty, newly widowed wife of his needed comforting, who better than someone who knows loss like me?

But I digress. When I fed Benson to the demon, it was here, in this basement. I wanted Mark to watch, too, to get a front row seat to what I’ve got in store for him. And Benson? Well, he was stoic to the end; the fact that he didn’t scream made it easier to concentrate on watching the gateway open, and now, I think I can use that to do what really needs doing.

See, I have a theory about God, and about Justice. There is only God in heaven, and God has no room for justice, for then he would have to answer to it as well. Therefore, the only Justice is in hell.

So what do you get for the man who had everything?

Anyway, it’s time now. I roll Mark over. He’s still glaring at me with those hate filled eyes. I lean in nice and close.

“How does it feel?” I ask.

I’ve set fires to the first floor of Dad’s mansion. It’ll burn up before it burns down, but it still helps with the atmosphere. I want everything of his to come crashing down- in this life, and the next. His house, his fortune, his legacy…..

….his son.

I don’t need to do it this way; and by this way, I mean carving out a pentagram in blood on the basement floor. I make sure Mark sees me though. I do it baby bird style; horking it up from deep with my guts, letting it splatter messily as I walk backwards around him.

“Do you like it?” I ask. “Leftovers. Your family sends their regards.”

Mark’s fury evaporates into pain as I stab my fingers through his elbow. He screams into his rags, and I pull my bloody fingers out and shake them upon the lines of the pentagram.

Like I said, I don’t need to do it this way. I could just eat Mark like I did his family, like I did Benson, and open the gate to hell that way. But no. When I’m done here, all that will be left is this circle, burned into the foundation of this house.

What happens after that…. Doesn’t really concern me.

I take my time with Mark. After all he’s put me through, I want to savor this moment for all eternity. With my fingernails, cracked, crooked, and jagged, I carve bloody swaths into his arms and legs. Howling against his gag, he struggles, but I am effortlessly stronger, and I break his wrists and elbows and knees to get him to hold still. His joints pop like a clown’s balloons.

Who’s laughing now, asshole?

I honk his nose with my fist. Pulp it really- a sour, foul smelly cherry running down his face. I throw him back to the basement floor, his head sending a resounding crack throughout the room.

“Isn’t that what they called you on the old track team, Marky?” I asked. “Thunderclap?” I grab him by his collar and slam him down again. “Huh? Isn’t it? Answer me!”

Every time I hurt the bastard, it feels so good. SO good, in fact, it sets the demon purring. It’s not just the smug satisfaction of making Mark bleed, or breaking his bones. I felt it with Benson, too. And with him, I was much, much kinder.

By now, my brother is a sopping, quivering mess, broken and twitching on the floor. He’s painting it red at such an alarming rate; I especially like how it flows into the pentagram. The whole thing begins to burn.

Smoke is filling even the basement now. It won’t be long.

Hell is a gross place.

We’re pulled into a thick fleshy gullet, mostly dark, but flaring to life. Through the membrane funneling us deeper and deeper, I see cobwebs of veins splaying out in every direction—connecting to larger, darker shapes. Oblong lumps that squirm, often with violently twitching limbs. It’s hot here- but not like the open, scorching heat of eternal flames you’d expect- a stuffy heat that fills the air with a putrid smell- centuries of sweat misting the air with breath. Mark is gagging and choking on it, and I would be too, were it not for the demon in me. To it, this is just home.

“Breathe deep, asshole,” I say, socking Mark in the gut. He gasps and crumples over, and that forces him into wheezing and deep, shuddering breaths. It’s totally gross, and I’m loving every second of it. I casually scratch at my forearm a bit, watching Mark writhe on the soupy flesh that passes for ground.

Once Mark stops hacking, I grab him by the back of his neck and haul him to his feet. “I hope you enjoyed that break, brother of mine,” I sneer. By now, Mark has lost all semblance of rage, of fury; now, he dares not meet my eyes, his lip quivering, shoulders slumped. “We are far from done.”

The deeper we go, the grosser it gets. Slime drips from the walls, and little sickening ripples trail us as I drag Mark through the gullet. Bulbous sphincters line the membrane walls, pulsing ever so slightly, oozing a foul, brackish fluid, thick and dark, with bits of crust shimmering in it. Beyond each one, through the translucent walls, those dark shapes, twitching and writhing, and now that we’re closer, vocalizing.

Some scream. Others grunt, or moan. More often than not, though, they wail.

I scratch my head. I’ve seen Mark do all of these things, tortured again and again by that video of his family being slaughtered. Seeing it from these faceless, unknown souls, it’s much less appetizing, even with the demon in me. I haul Mark up and shove his face into the wall- like pressing him face first into a trampoline. He squirms and struggles, much like the tortured soul inside. That, at least, is amusing.

We’re not there yet though. I smear Mark along the wall, and we’re being pulled deeper and deeper. I’ve never been to hell, but somehow, even here, I know where to go; the throat begins to branch out, some sick and twisted lung, deep shuddering breaths all in unison, inhale, suffer, exhale, repeat.

Finally, we come to an empty chamber. As we approach, the sphincter opens wide, gushing out a torrent of absolutely foul bile. I toss Mark into its path and stand aside- some of it splashes me and it feels so cold I shiver head to toe. It’s also incredibly sticky, and smells worse up close. Mark howls as it splashes over him, and I can see splotches and burns forming on his skin where the oil touches. Steam fills up the narrow corridor.

I wipe what I can of the slimy mess off of me. At the edge of my vision, movement; tendrils push their way out of the chamber and begin to loop themselves around Mark, gently, almost lovingly, in fact. They drag him slowly into the abyss. He stares at me with wide, tear filled eyes as he goes, and for the first time, I see it.

The sort of expression I never thought I would see on Mark’s face.

I didn’t see it when I father and I pulled up to the ditch Mark had crashed my brand new car in, where he stood sheepishly smiling at me like a kid with his fingers in the cookie jar, even as smoke billowed out of the ditch.

Nor when I came into my dorm room to find him balls deep in my girlfriend, leering back at me over his shoulder.

*Not even when he opened the door to the basement to see if the demon had finished eating me yet.*

Guilt. Regret. And, more than his rage, more than his pain, more than his sorrow, more than anything I’d ever made him feel watching his family die over and over and OVER again….

It…..tasted….

GOOD.

I watch through the wall as the tendrils drag him into the center of the chamber, hoist him up, pulling taut. He hangs, a demented marionette, soon jerking and screaming to the whims of the wires.

There are tendrils holding him tight, others that twist and yank his limbs, and perhaps worst of all, one working its way down his throat. A thick, fat, slimy tentacle, sickly yellow in color, pulsating ever so slightly as it slips past his jaw. I can hear him gagging and sputtering, choking on it, but the more he struggles, the tighter the tendrils hold.

As I watch, the putrid scent lingers in my nostrils. Turns out the scent heralds a bevy of sensations- little glimpses of sight, of sound…of feelings- mental, tactile.

I can feel, most prominently, Mark’s anguish. What is suffering to him is the warm sun on my skin, the cool sweat after a good workout. It fills my belly almost like a good meal.

Almost. While the sphincter is pulling shut, as I watch Mark twist and jerk and scream, I catch a whiff of what’s happening in his mind- a glimpse of Marky’s hell. Flashes of what he sees cut through-the dining room, his family chained to it. And, while he takes all manner of brutal implements to their helpless bodies, He screams at them…. In our father’s voice. Tearing them down the way dad always did me.

It hits me, a sugar rush, and in these little spurts, I’m all giddy… and yet,

It stings, here and there, too.  A cattle prod, zapping my tender bits. Until now, Mark’s suffering has brought me nothing but pleasure, and yet….Is it my father? His words have always stung at best. That would make the most sense. I shrug it off, scratching the last of the bile from my shoulders and chest.

“Goodbye Mark.”

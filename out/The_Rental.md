Gwangju, Busan, South Korea 2018

I own some apartments and shop front properties in Busan, South Korea. Yes, the infamous “Train to Busan” destination. I inherited the properties from my parents who both passed away when I was 23. I am 37 years old now and thankful at least they taught me all about managing the operational and business side of being a mini land lord.
Being in Busan all my life, I can assure you all that things are not as exciting as the movie suggests. 

I get paid quite well from rentals from my properties; sure there are problems and disputes to be solved once in a while. But you get that in any other job, not to mention a business.

So, in 2018 I happened to rent out a whole apartment unit to a Japanese couple. The rental term is 2 years with a month’s security deposit refundable when they return the keys and the unit returned in good condition.

We did the normal arrangements: viewing, explanations of the terms & conditions, paper work and payment of security deposit. Nothing out of the usual, all went smoothly.

Right from the start, they always pay on time via bank transfer. I never heard any request, complains, questions etc etc… for first 3 months. I figured they are private and maybe easy going. No complaints, quite the model tenants.

One day i decided to a courtesy call to the unit. (You know, want to be a good landlord and to make sure my place is all ok). But no answer of calls, nor my visits during off work hours yield any response. Seems they are out the most of the time. 

I was paranoid that there maybe an accident, problem, emergency or illegal use of the apartment so I used the spare key to open the unit. (After maybe 10 calls and 3 unfruitful visits).
 
I found the place totally untouched from when I handed over the unit; only more dust have settled in. But is not those messy dirty state; is just dusty. 
it is as if as they never used the unit: furniture not moved, no new items etc etc.. 
The normal usual dust just settles and accumulated.

I then checked with the utilities company. Found out that they pay on time, no arrears but also realised that there is no usage of electricity or water. Ever. 
I found it real strange and thought about it over a few sleepless nights. In the end, I decided to leave them alone. Since they paying right? And on time with no problems. 

That was the first and last time i checked on them and they never contacted me until the last day of the term; when the keys are mailed back to me. 

I went to the unit to check so that I can sign the end of lease documents and return their security deposit. 

The place looked like as if for 2 years, they never used or even went in.
There is more dust to add on to my unsolicited visit otherwise the state is the same: furniture not moved, no new items etc etc.. 

I was spooked honestly, being my first strange encounter in my business. However, as it turns out, its not my last….



Luck would have it, my own apartment caught fire . Heck, the entire floor caught fire, starting from a neighbour. I have no choice but to move into the one mentioned in this story. At least luckily it was vacant for 2 months till now so I got a place to stay.
I bought some essentials and kept the receipts; hoping to claim from my insurance. I sort of partially moved in with some new stuff, just the essentials.

One night, I was in the bed room, lying on the bed and watching Netflix on my Apple iPad. I closed the room door as I had the air conditioning on. Then suddenly, as clear as day, I heard a knock on the bedroom door.

Knock knock

I froze. I swore my heart has stopped for a split second. 
Impossible to have someone in the house. I am alone and my main door is locked, I hope?
I opened the door cautiously, heart pounding and looked into the dark space. I could not take the suspense and ran for the light switch. 
A quick look around every corner. There is no one. 
I checked my main door, it was locked.
I was scared out of my wits. I switched on every light I have and every little sound startled me and forced me to look at its direction. 
Safe to say, I only managed to sleep when I got exhausted, slumped on the couch.

The next day, I woke up and had nothing on the agenda. I took a walk downstairs, looking around the neighbour hood. One of the shop owners nearby asked me if I just moved in.
I explained what I do and what the apartment means to me. He threw his head back and asked me in a stern voice if I knew the history of the place. Or rather, what happened 6 days ago before I moved in. Apparently, a kid died due to mis-adventure. He fell out of the window while his mum was in the kitchen preparing dinner. The shop owner laughed and said that almost everyone knew the boy. He charmed everyone although he got a penchant to knock on people’s doors and wait for them to open the door. Usually the owners will let him in and play with him or give him snacks or sweets.

At this point, I don’t know which is worse. The knock or the fact that the unit was vacant with no good explanation. 
I told the shop keeper about the knock I heard last night. He initially looked surprised and went to his wall calendar and did some counting. He then turned and looked at me and told me that the Chinese believed the soul of the deceased will go back to him/her house on the 7th day. (which was last night, the night of the knock). The shop keeper said, it is a form of last good bye and visit before being taken away to judgement. He assured me that the Chinese belief that they are under guard the whole time and will go back to the ghost realm after the 7th night.
I thanked the shop owner for the advice and information and left his shop.

At night, I went back, ensured that the main door is locked and tucked into bed with all of the lights closed. I was almost falling into sleep when I heard a distinctive little boy’s voice:

“저랑 놀아주세요?”

It means: would you play with me?

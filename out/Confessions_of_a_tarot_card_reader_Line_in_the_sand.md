Dear friends, I've hit a snag. 

Roj and Cecily are fine, but I'm not.  [My new deck](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v1u5x8/confessions_of_a_tarot_card_reader_blaze_of_glory/) is... troublesome immediately comes to mind but feels immensely inadequate.  It's complete, if the lack of new cards appearing is any indication, but what that means for me has me frightened. 

This deck fills me with a sense of dread, and not just because the cards are far more dark than the darkest card in my original deck. 

Things in Oceanview are precarious still. There's a definite divide appearing and it's bound to tear this quaint place apart. I was hopeful we could mend things but after this... Friends, lend me an ear. 

It's a rare occasion that Cecily and Roj let me out of their sight. I was wrong to think I had kept my new deck a secret from them.  They knew about it. I suppose they were waiting for me to come to them but in true fashion, I fouled spectacularly and needed rescuing. 

I managed to sneak away while we were in town restocking on supplies.  The home team - those on our side - were friendly but tense.  There opposing side kept to themselves but still managed a foreboding presence simply by just being there. I did my best to ignore them and truly had no intention of skipping away from my friends, but when their lighthearted banter over what breakfast cereal they wanted to get turned serious, I found myself stealing away unnoticed. 

I'd be lying if I said I had no destination in mind, but I'd also be remiss if I didn't explain how confused I was as to why I felt the sudden and pressing need to be there, of all places.  My confusion morphed to cold dread when, several hours later, I found myself walking down a street holding a bloodstained knife. I can't quite say there is any amount of preparation for such an event.  I dropped the knife with a start and only barely managed to stifle my surprised scream. 

I heard voices moments later and my instinct was to head toward them. I did, in fact, do just that. But then one voice rose above the others and froze me in my tracks. 

"Find whoever did that and end them."

The Hag!

"Did you *see* it?  It's a message!  They're trying to stake a claim!"

"I don't care what they're trying to do!  Find them and **end** them!"

I dashed behind a nearby parked car and flattened myself against it while holding my breath.  I tried to make myself as small as possible and stayed that way as they passed by.

"But he was-"

"Either you do what I say or I'll use you to send a message of my own."

A shudder tickled its way down my spine from not only the malice in her voice but the sincerity behind her words.  An uneasy knot began to form in my stomach, too, over whatever this supposed message was.  If it was enough to rattle the Hag - because, for certain, she was rattled - it had to be something else.

Once their voices faded, I crept out from my hiding spot and headed in the direction they'd come from.  Something told me I wouldn't have to look hard or long to spot the "message".

A crowd had gathered and stood clustered together before it.  I had only just glimpsed it when someone grabbed me from behind and pressed their hand over my mouth.  I was rather unceremoniously hauled backwards into a dimly lit room.

"Michelle!"

Cecily's voice is all that soothed my raw fear.  I stopped clawing at the hand over my mouth and when released, spun around to see Roj and Cecily standing together.  I drew my arms around myself and began to shiver.

"Chel..."  Cecily started to say something when she was interrupted by a loud shout from outside.  Other voices quickly rose in anger and soon there was a full blown shouting match.

"Not here!" Roj said as he hurried past me to the door to check the lock and draw the blinds.  

Cecily motioned for me to follow her and I did, feeling quite numb.  We settled in a back store room with Roj standing guard at the door.

"You shouldn't have run off like that," Cecily chided.  "You have to be careful!"

I had my hands tucked under my arms and only then realized they hadn't seen the blood on them.  I nervously bit my lip and studied her expression, trying to decipher what, if anything, she knew.

"I'm sorry..."  I started to say something more, to try and explain how I had no recollection of anything after I'd left them in the store, to maybe even beg for her help but I saw her flinch.  Her eyes were slightly wider than usual and she kept looking over my shoulder to where Roj stood.  I realized at that moment that she was afraid of me.

My friend, my only real friend here, was frightened of me and I didn't blame her in the least bit.  I very nearly started to cry and instantly hated myself for the weakness of it.  I ground my teeth together and squeezed my eyes shut, breathing in deep and slow before formulating a plan.  When I opened my eyes, Cecily was staring at me cautiously.

"I'm sorry," I said again, "For everything.  But you're better off without me.  Both of you."  I looked toward Roj as I said this and saw him move toward me, maybe sensing what I was about to do.

I was quicker, if marginally.  I stood and put my hands out before me.  The sight of the blood on them was enough to stop him in his tracks and for Cecily to gasp.  "You don't know what I'm capable of.  If you want to survive, stay out of my way."  My voice wavered and broke, nearly so did my resolve.  Desperate as I was for their protection, I knew they needed mine more.

"Take care of Cheeks for me."  With that, I rushed past Roj and out of the shop.  

I suppose he could've tried to stop me but I'm glad he didn't.  I truly don't know what I'm capable of anymore, especially after seeing the message that rattled the Hag.  A message I am beyond positive I sent.  Without going into specifics because... I just can't...I'm know that I am a danger to anyone that stands in my way.

I know you're inclined to think whatever was in Roj now resides in me but that's not the case.  I think by freeing him, I tapped into something I wasn't quite ready for.  Perhaps its foolish to do this on my own, but until I can find a way to control this, its the only way I can immediately guarantee Roj and Cecily's safety.  I know they'll keep the others safe.  As for the Hag and her kind?  Thanks to my message, I suppose they know I'm coming for them.  I expect they'll be prepared.

I won't lie.  A small part of me is excited for the carnage that's to come.  But a larger part of me is afraid because I've seen what [I'm willing to do](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vff6gl/confessions_of_a_tarot_card_reader_the_truth/) and I don't know that there's a line in the sand.

At the time the event occurred, I had no idea of the urban legend the locals called *cirikkum manitan.*

**My name is Rex and this occurred to my family and me 3 years ago. I was 17 at the time. This New Year’s nightmare would forever haunt me and my family. My father owned a few houses but we usually just stayed in the biggest house. We were spending New Year’s Eve in my parents' birth country, which was Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka was a really hot place instead of cold. After Christmas, I was really enjoying myself there as I got a lot of gifts from relatives. It was then New Year’s  Eve and my family was out shopping. My grandma and I were the only ones home. It was around 11 when I heard the front gate open. I went to check when I heard the noise of a person walking in the living room. I shouted, “ are you guys home?”.** 

**I heard someone counting down. By now, I was scared but my grandmother was sleeping and I didn’t want to disturb her. I checked the time on the clock. It was 11:58 and someone was still counting down. I decided watching television will help ease my mind but I still heard the countdown as it got closer to zero. I then heard someone say the happy new year as the living room window started to be smashed. There was someone grinning with a huge knife. I woke up my grandmother and told her we have to run.** 

**My grandmother was scared as we hid in the kitchen. I picked up a knife and we just sat there. I didn’t hear anything so I ran for the phone. I called my parents and I peeked into the living room. No one was there and the window wasn't even smashed but it was open when the house's windows were all sealed shut. I instructed my grandmother to continue hiding in the kitchen while I went to check. I was frightened but I said a prayer to the lord as I first checked the living room. His grin to this day still scares me. My grandmother and I checked the whole house even outside but we saw nobody. We locked all the doors and windows and foolishly never called anyone for help, thinking it was all my imagination. My grandmother and I went to bed and I woke up just 10 minutes later.**

**I heard breathing right beside me and then a whisper saying “play with me”. I ignored whoever that was as I was in tears. He made me turn around and I saw his big grin and his knife. My family arrived and he sprinted out. I shouted for my family to come and my dad and uncle went looking for him. My mom called the police and they came and only found a carved knife letter saying “ seeing everyone soon”. We left Sri Lanka shortly after and my relatives there who knew about this all saw him so my dad told me not to ever tell anyone about this. My grandmother died shortly after from a heart attack and my uncle said the grinning might have something to do with her death. So yes, I am sorry for telling you guys this story, but he’ll be seeing you later.**

My uncle used to say that life tends to last longer for people that avoid experiencing it. I doubt that saying was supposed to be used to discourage trying new things, but then again I don’t think the man ever even considered the opposite. It’s not like I’d show up with a new hobby everyday, I suppose partly thanks to him draining the joy of finding one. When he berated me for bringing a new board game to my nephews, I just let it go. However, when I later caught him burning the brand new copy of risk, a grudge was born that only grew throughout the years.

I’m only telling you this because you need to understand how absolutely unbelievable it was when he told my parents he had taken up a new pastime. Apparently he had been talking to a coworker at his boring old desk job and they had set him up with a penpal, writing each other letters every week. Obviously when I heard this I was in utter disbelief. If it wasn’t for the fact that the surprise made me absentmindedly spill hot tea over my hands I would have sworn I was dreaming.

A penpal? My uncle had a penpal? My parents must have noticed my confusion, as they told me to be happy that maybe my uncle would become less of a buzzkill. Yeah, my parents didn’t like the man either. I had to wonder though: what did my uncle have to actually write about that would make anyone want to write back? I decided that whatever the case, the person on the receiving end probably wasn’t the “carpe diem” type either and forgot about it.

About a month after I learned about my uncle’s penpal, we noticed that something was different.  Because my uncle lived in the same street, it wasn’t uncommon for him to stop by unannounced (to both me and my parents’ dismay). My parents should probably have actually talked to him about this, but I guess being a bit socially inept runs in the family. I won’t deny that I still find it hard to tackle confrontations myself.

Anyway, my uncle no longer stopped by our house.  We came to that realization when the overall mood in the house started getting better. When I caught myself actually being able to relax in our front yard it occurred to me that I didn’t subconsciously expect to get rudely interrupted anymore. 

I gladly welcomed the change, and thus got justifiably irritated when my father immediately called his brother to ask how he was doing. It wasn’t a long conversation, but what caught me off guard was hearing my father almost exclusively answering questions from the other side. Sure it’s nothing out of the ordinary when normal people call, but I know for a fact that my uncle never uttered any more than 3 words on the phone. 

My dad, seemingly unfazed, gave a few simple answers and hung up with an unexpected sigh of relief. When he noticed that I had been listening along, he ignored the clearly annoyed look on my face and asked me if we still had any kids’ books lying around. If I wasn’t still processing the phone call I would have been even more confused upon hearing that question. My brain was already working overtime however, and I answered the question on autopilot, directing my father to the bottom shelf of my dresser. 

As he walked upstairs, I stared blankly at the ceiling, processing what I could only describe as a slowly encroaching feeling of unease. I tried to distract myself with snacks and TV, unwilling to let that sensation control me. Regardless, I found my mind wandering back again and again.

Surely my uncle just wanted to send the books to his penpal who just happened to be a fresh parent. But even then, what bothered me wasn’t that he asked for my old childrens’ books. Heck, I even begrudgingly accepted that he was able to entertain his penpal for what had already been a month. But what I found absolutely impossible to accept was that this man, whom I had known my whole life as a miserable and depressing real-life adaptation of ebenezer scrooge, was suddenly putting in any amount of effort for someone else. I know some people will think that very harsh, and my response is simply that would you have been unlucky enough to meet the man, I guarantee you would be just as harsh if not more so.

Later that day, there was a knock on the door. I knew it had to be my uncle. Having taken the whole afternoon to collect my thoughts, I didn’t feel uneasy anymore. Instead, I felt a cold, bitter resentment for the man that couldn’t have made a positive impact if he catapulted a plus sign. I stumbled to the door, grabbing the pile of childrens’ books my dad left on the stairs before heading off. When I reached for the doorknob however, I caught a glimpse of my uncle through the tiny glass window on my door, and I froze. What I felt then was neither resentment, nor any slight unease. When I saw that awful man standing there, as depressing a figure as the last time I saw him, I knew that the imitation of a smile he was wearing couldn’t be real. Somehow that made it all the more terrifying.

I suppose I should once again blame my body going on autopilot for what happened next. While I thought I was frozen in stone cold fear, I suddenly realized that I felt the door handle turning in my hands. Just as I wanted to stop myself, just as I wanted to slam the door shut and run upstairs to hide under my covers like a little kid, just then I realized that I was too late. 

The door started to slowly creep open, and reaching for the door handle meant sticking my hand closer to what I knew for a fact was a threat. They say animal instincts kick in at moments like that. And at that same traumatizing moment, I knew that my body wouldn’t go with either fight or flight. It just froze. Like a deer in headlights I suppose, inner thoughts yelling that maybe I just imagined it, pulling out all the stops just to try and push away my alarming gut feeling.

Then the door slowly cracked open enough to reveal my uncle. And he was smiling. Still that sick, twisted smile. I’ve wondered for a long time wether or not that smile would have been as vile if it had been someone else. My shrink always told me that my mind somehow exaggerates my memories because of my lingering resentment towards my uncle. Still, even if that smile was less wide, even if it didn’t seem like he had a few too many teeth, even if he was in fact smiling normally, it still would have scared me. But it really was that unnatural. No amount of therapy will make me believe otherwise.

For a while, the length of which I can’t even begin to describe, we just stood there. Facing each other. I must have started crying, because I remember that at some point my face started feeling wet. I still couldn’t bring myself to move. Eventually, the silence was broken by a lower pitched, grating voice that sounded only vaguely reminiscent of that of my uncle’s.

“HE IS GRATEFUL FOR THE BOOKS”

The jarring speech definitely came from him, but his excruciating smile never moved even an inch. He grabbed the books and walked backwards to his house, all the while maintaining eye contact. Only then did I notice the emotion in his eyes. It’s something I’ve never been able to do, but in this case even I could tell. My uncle, somewhere in there, was scared to death. Those eyes, not unlike those of a tortured animal, were somehow even more terrified than I was. Nonetheless, he kept walking. I’m pretty sure he even locked his door while those eyes were still locked on me, silently pleading for it to end.

That was the last time anyone ever saw my uncle. When they got home, my parents found a traumatized husk instead of the son they’d known. It took months of constant therapy for me to finally open up again. According to my parents I just repeated the words “uncle” and “not happy” for a while. That made them go check on him and, well, he wasn’t home anymore. 

Instead, after they had finally found the spare key, they walked into an almost empty house. He had gotten rid of everything except for a simple desk in the middle of his living room, stacked almost to the ceiling with handwritten letters. Eventually I got my father to admit he grabbed one to read, but it shocked him so much he immediately pulled my mother out of the house and burned the place to the ground. Miraculously the fire didn’t spread, which is something I’m still thankful for. The fire brigade definitely knew it was foul play, but for some reason nothing further was done. I assume they (hastily) came to the conclusion that my uncle had started the fire himself after finding out that no-one had seen him in a month, and further discovering that none of them cared to.





I wish this story ended there. I guess looking back at it now, maybe I should have listened to my uncle and chosen to experience less of life. Maybe I could have avoided such a somber fate. Not a lot of use dwelling on it now though.

I feel like my whining has gone on long enough. Though I suppose I’ve stretched it out a bit because I dread what I’m going to do after I post this…

My father has been getting quite a bit older, and recently he got diagnosed with dementia. I don’t mind taking care of him at all, but yesterday he told me something that made me relive this awful chain of events all over again.

He told me that he has made a penpal. Someone is sending him letters, and he wants me help him write a response.

I don’t know what will happen when I open these letters. Maybe I’ll follow in my fathers footsteps and burn this entire place to the ground… Then again if that actually worked I might have been able to experience more of life. I really hope I still can.

Alright, time to stop running. Does anyone know the proper way to address something that deeply terrifies you?

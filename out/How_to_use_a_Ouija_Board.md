It has come to my attention that there is not much proper advice on how to use a Ouija Board (properly) on the internet. I have done personal research and experimentation on this subject of the occult and have come up with a thoroughly tested method of use. 

With that out of the way, here is what I’ve come up with:

Number of people:

Using a Ouija Board is a group activity (my apologies to any friendless nerds). You will need a group of 3 or more people, including yourself, who are able to behave in a cordial manner or at least keep their mouths shut. 

Ouija Board Operation: 

There are two points of operation on a Ouija Board, the communicator/medium/the guy/girl/xe/xer/xwatever that does the the talking (I will use the term ‘Communicator’) and then there are the the “Planchettes” the ones with their hands on the weird moving bit/planchette. 

Job of the Communicator: 

Please note that I say “Communicator”. Singular. There will only ever be one communicator, no exceptions. As the communicator, you will not have your hands on any part of the Ouija Board. As the person opening yourself up to communication with the other side, placing a part of your physical self on the medium being used for communication is basically like pissing on a live wire, big no-no. You will be the person asking the spirit questions or providing answers to their questions. Be respectful, the spirit (or possibly demon) is your guest. It is best that you treat them well. You will also be the person taking note of the entity’s answers, as you will be the only person able to see them. 

Job of the Planchettes: 

First off, as a planchette, you will not be the one communicating. You will keep your mouth shut, and if there is something you must say or ask, the only person you will speak to is the present communicator. You will also need to bring something that can be used as a blindfold. Being a planchette is a multi person job. There should be 2 or more, but I do not recommend any more than 4, at that point it’s just getting crowded. At the start of the ‘ritual’ you will be blindfolded and you will place your hand on the Planchette (the actual wooden piece, not the person next to you). It is best that you try to keep a clear mind, but if you do have difficulty with that it’s fine to just let it wonder about lighthearted subjects (e.g. your favorite tv show, or any books you’ve been reading). You may feel a strange presence, but don’t mind it. 

Instructions: 

To begin the ritual, assign everyone their jobs and make sure they understand what they are doing. 

The Planchettes (if two) will be perpendicular to each other, (If more than two) they will simply be evenly spaced around the board. After being blindfolded, they will place their hands on the planchette, they can do one or both hands, but if they do one hand everyone else must also use the same hand. Meaning: if one person uses their left hand, everyone else must use their left hand. Once everyone is in position the ritual is good to go, there’s no extra figure eights around the board needed, but you may do so if you wish. 

As the Communicator, you should have a notebook or something to write on and questions prepared beforehand. It’s fine if you ask questions you came up with on the spot, but you don’t want to end up summoning something and not having anything to ask. That’s just a waste of time, both yours and theirs. You will be the one who invites the spiritual guest, there’s no specific manner that you have to invite them. Just be respectful, call out their name (if you know it) and ask them to be your guest. If you wish for the interview to end, request that the spirit leave and tell the planchettes to remove themselves from any contact with the board. 

Rules and other information:

Planchettes are not to communicate with the spirit. They are already in physical contact with the other side. Communicating opens them to mental contact with the other side or “spiritual” contact. Being in both spiritual and physical contact with the other side opens you up to possession, physical harm or other forms of “interference”. That’s the same reason the Communicator should not touch the Ouija Board or any of the Planchettes. Avoid two points of contact at the same time. That is a rule that should always be maintained.

Regarding electronics, time of day and lighting. Electronics and lighting do not seem to have an effect on the ritual. However, time of day does seem to have an effect on success rate. Just after Dusk and Just before Dawn are the best times to operate. Generally night time is better for operation than the day. You may do this in a well lit room at any of those times, you can have your phones or any PED’s with you in the room, just put them on silent. However, if you wish to record the ritual, do ask permission beforehand, that’s just common courtesy. 

Regarding location and religious artifacts. I do not recommend doing this ritual in your home, nor do I recommend doing it in a location with known demonic activity. That is a horrible idea. 
Places I do recommend: old hotels, graveyards, historical sites, good camping spots, and old battlefields. 
Places I do not recommend: Prisons, Asylums, abandoned churches, swamps, and native reserves (America).
You may bring whatever religious artifact you like. However, it will be completely ineffective, you are specifically inviting the other being to be there. Holy water may work though, that’s only if the spirit is malicious and not who you invited. But if you are trying to communicated with a demon (bad idea) and you have a cross or something similar, that’s basically like trying to summon Anne Frank while waving around the nazi flag. Don’t do it. 

Generally avoid impolite conversation. Don’t bring up matters that are too personal. If you wouldn’t tell that to a passing stranger then you probably shouldn’t tell it to the summoned entity. 
Avoid summoning family or anyone who was close to you. That greatly increases your chances of summoning a demon or malicious spirit. 
Avoid using your own name or the names of the participants in the ritual.

ICO (In Case Of): 

An entity that will not leave, if you are able to still feel their presence or they continue to try to communicate after you ask them to leave. Either douse the Ouija Board in holy water or burn it and promptly leave the area. 

A Planchette who is unable to remove themselves from the board (the reason there should be 2 or more Planchettes). Tell the other Planchette(s) to push them off the board after taking off their blindfolds. Do not even waste the time to burn the Ouija Board. Leave immediately, run if you can. 

A demonic possession. Restrain the individual (the communicator is allowed to make contact). Take them to a religious center if possible. If that option is unavailable, take them to the ER and say that they had a seizure and started acting violent. A hospital is equipped to prevent individuals from harming themselves or others.

It all started when I met Mitch.

I was pretty small-time before I met him in the state pen. We were cellmates. He was finishing up the tail-end of a five-year stretch for his part in an armed robbery and attempted murder, and I was just beginning a two-year stint for getting busted for...well, let's just say I was an 'unlicensed pharmaceutical rep' and leave it at that. I had been facing a much heavier sentence but had cut a deal with the cops and turned in my partners, who were all small-time lowlife punks themselves.

Like I said, I was pretty small-time before I hooked up with Mitch, but Mitch was a seasoned pro who had some big connections on the outside. We were only cellmates for eighteen months before he got sprung, but we hit it off together in that time. At night we'd sit on our bunks after lights out, smoking cigarettes (and passing an occasional joint), talking quietly, just shooting the shit, talking about our pasts. Truthfully, he became the closest thing to a best friend I ever had. I was lucky to have met someone like him. He was a pretty intense guy; kind of scary, really, and had been a career criminal for most of his life. Like me, he'd had a fucked-up childhood and parents who had pretty much ignored his existence until they'd needed a human stress ball to vent their frustrations upon. *Un*like me, he was a pretty big guy -- a broad-shouldered, ex-body-builder with a hard, intimidating stare. I know *I* found him intimidating. He probably could have snapped me in two like a toothpick with one hand if he was so inclined. I was careful to never give him any reason to do so.

He had some clout in the prison and my association with him almost singlehandedly saved me from being "turned out" by the other cons and becoming a plaything passed around in the shower room. Otherwise, I wouldn't have stood a chance on my own inside. I'm not a very big guy, and not intimidating at all.

Right before he got out, he told me if I ever needed work once I got sprung, he could set me up with a job through his "employer." He gave me his number.

I finished my sentence six months later and the first thing I did was give Mitch a call. I didn't really have anything else going for me. My family had washed their hands of me long ago, I had no friends, and with a tenth-grade education and no real skills or training, the only line of work I was really qualified for was of the kind that entailed cleaning deep fryers, washing cars, or cleaning out gutters for minimum wage.

Mitch picked me up outside the prison, driving a new Dodge Challenger that looked like he had just driven it off the dealership lot. He greeted me with a hug, like an old friend, then drove me through the city to a warehouse near the docks.

It was there that he introduced me to his boss, a large, scary looking gray-haired middle-aged guy with the grim face of an undertaker, predatory eyes of a vulture, and rough-textured skin of a lizard. Mitch introduced him to me as "Mr. Vadimov," but everyone just called him The Russian.

He sat behind his polished oak desk in his office off the warehouse floor, bookended by a pair of huge goons in matching dark suits, smoking a huge cigar clutched in a hand decked out with what looked to be at least several hundred thousand dollars in expensive jeweled gold rings, eyeing me stonily as Mitch explained how he knew me and that I was looking for a job. When he finished, the Russian regarded me in silence for what felt like an eternity, but probably wasn't longer than ten seconds, then shrugged and said in his heavily accented English, "Sure, why not?"

And that was how I became involved in organized crime.

I spent the next five years working for the Russian, gradually climbing up through the ranks of his organization, beginning as a low-level "courier" picking up envelopes from the Russian's team of "distributors" throughout the city that contained the proceeds of the "product" the Russian supplied them with and delivering the envelopes to Mitch to give to the Russian himself. Sometimes Mitch accompanied me on these outings to make sure the "distributors" stayed in line and weren't skimming. Usually, they played straight, but on a couple occasions Mitch had to get rough with a couple of them who he suspected were "holding out."

After about a year the Russian felt he could trust me enough to "promote" me to the position of a middle man who picked up the packages containing his "product" from his "suppliers" and then deliver them to yet another "buffer" who in turn gave them to the "distributors" to sell. I usually went on these "business trips" alone, which always made me nervous because the Russian's "suppliers" were pretty scary dudes themselves. But none of them ever gave me any trouble. I asked Mitch one time what the packages contained, what exactly the Russian's "product" was and he replied in a deadpan tone of voice: "Girl Scout cookies," then gave me a hard, wordless look that told me that I shouldn't ask too many questions and the less I knew, the better. I didn't push it. I had a pretty good idea, anyway. It was pretty much the same racket I had been involved in before I got busted, just on a much bigger, better organized scale.

Drugs were a big part of the Russian's business, but they weren't all he was involved in. He had a dozen different other rackets going on. The usual things; extortion, gambling, money laundering, prostitutes, stolen goods, dealing guns on the black market, match fixing, you name it.

And of course, armed robbery.

Eventually, I worked my way up into the circle of the Russian's stock company of regular crooks. I wasn't a violent type by nature, and never really thought of myself as a career criminal before I met Mitch, just a petty street dealer trying to get by, but in those five years I worked for the Russian I discovered a lot of things about myself and found a side of my character that had been hidden from me up until then. I learned how to use a gun Mitch gave me (since it would have been difficult to obtain one legally, being a convicted felon) and ever though I (thankfully) never had to use it, I felt fairly confident I could if the need arose.

I participated in two bank "jobs" and an armored car heist the Russian organized, all three successful, clean heists that left no one hurt and combined netted us over four million in cash. My share wasn't bad, even after the Russian had taken his sizeable cut and the rest had been shared out four ways.

The Russian considered himself something of a "visionary." A businessman with a keen sense of strategy and acumen. He was always looking for ways to expand his enterprise. New schemes to bring in more cash.

It was his idea to kidnap the girl.

I was in my apartment one night last fall watching some piece of shit horror movie (a killer leprechaun was tearing a man's stomach open to retrieve the pot of gold he had magically transported inside of him) when my phone rang. It was Mitch telling me the Russian wanted me down at his warehouse in one hour.

I drove down to the docks and parked behind the warehouse where several other vehicles were parked. It was past ten p.m., and this part of the city was deserted this time of night. I looked around in the darkness, shivering a little (it was late October, and chilly), feeling a little uneasy, wondering why the Russian had summoned me so late and with so little notice.

The rear service door beside the loading docks opened and a dark figure appeared, silhouetted against the light spilling out through the open doorway. I could see the smoldering red tip of a cigarette in its mouth.

It was Mitch.

Without a word, he gestured me inside.

I followed him across the warehouse floor and into the Russian's office. The Russian was waiting for us with his bodyguards, and two other guys who worked for him, both of whom I knew from the two bank jobs I had done for the Russian. Their names were Kenny and Wyatt. We exchanged brief nods of greeting with each other, then the Russian got down to business.

He laid it all out for us, the biggest job we had done yet,  a high risk/high reward scheme that, if it went according to plan, could lead to our biggest score ever.

Kidnapping for ransom.

It had been done before, with varying levels of success, and was still pretty common in the Russian's native country, although it didn't happen very often anymore here in the States.

The Russian already had his target in mind: the seventeen-year-old daughter of a billionaire software mogul. She was something of a celebrity in her own right on account of her "wild child" reputation and had been featured in several tabloids because of her numerous scrapes with the law for underaged drinking, drugs, and several DUI's and arrests for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct. Fed up with her unruly behavior, Daddy had finally intervened and sent his out-of-control daughter first to rehab, then to a girl's reform school where she had cleaned up her act and started behaving like a model citizen. She was now attending an exclusive East Coast boarding school and was bound for Harvard after she graduated next spring.

The Russian's vast network of sources had informed him that the girl was coming home for the Holidays next month. That was when we were going to make our move.

I had serious misgivings about this whole thing right from the get-go. I knew most ransom kidnappings never worked and usually ended with the perps either dead or in jail before they ever even saw the cash. And even if they *did* manage to collect the ransom, usually the bills had been marked or had their serial numbers recorded to lead back to the kidnappers.

I voiced these concerns to the Russian, who assured me that he had already taken all that into consideration and planned to make sure the money would be untraceable. He explained to us that, given the size of the ransom, it wouldn't be feasible to demand it in cash. Instead, when we contacted the girl's father, he would be instructed to deposit the money into an encrypted, untraceable escrow account, which the Russian would then transfer into an -- again, untraceable -- offshore account in the Cayman Islands. There would be no paper trail for the cops and feds to follow, no risky drop-off meeting. No one would ever see us or know who we were.

At this point Wyatt interrupted the Russian to ask exactly how big the ransom demand was. The Russian told us.

One hundred million dollars. Of which, the four of us would each receive ten million.

You could have knocked us over with a feather. It was more than we had ever made knocking off banks. More than we could ever hope to make in a lifetime of working for the Russian, the kind of once-in-a-lifetime dream job most crooks can never hope to come their way.

The Russian told us what was going to happen, and what was expected of us. He had been planning this meticulously for weeks, down to the last detail. The girl was going to be transported from the boarding school to her father's estate in the country by a limousine. In addition to the driver, there would be two armed body guards accompanying her. The Russian knew the route they were taking. The boarding school was upstate and the highway they would take led through a wooded area way out in the boonies, thirty miles south. Miles away from the nearest town. There would be no one around. He knew the date she was leaving the school and the approximate time it would take them to arrive at the "interception point." At which point we would stop the vehicle with a "Highway Construction" ruse, disarm the guards, bind them and the driver with zip-ties and grab the girl, driving her over two hundred miles West to a small cabin in the woods where we would be keeping her until her father paid up. Me, Kenny and Wyatt were going to be the ones doing the dirty work. Mitch would be the getaway driver, and would be "supervising" the "operation" to make sure things didn't get out of hand, being one of the Russian's most trusted enforcers.

Like I said, I didn't dig this set-up from the word Go. I'm a criminal, but this wasn't knocking over banks or transporting stolen goods or moving drugs. This was something else entirely; a whole new ball game. Kidnapping for ransom was serious shit, and could get us all dead or facing some seriously heavy time - probably life without parole.

After the Russian dismissed us from his office, I told Mitch about my misgivings but he assured me that the Russian had planned everything with care and overlooked nothing. It was be easy as pie, and no one would get hurt.

I should have said no and backed out. But I felt like I owed it to Mitch, and not just because he saved me from getting gang-raped in stir. Without him, the best I could have ever hoped for was working at McDonald's and driving a twenty-year-old car back to some shitty double-wide I called home. And, I confess, I also wanted that ten mil. I let my greed get the best of me, take over and override my better judgement. I said: "Okay."

And now they're all dead. And I have to live with it.

\*\*\*\*\*

The late-night meeting at the Russian's office was a few days before Halloween. The three of us -- me, Kenny and Wyatt -- spent the next four weeks meeting up with Mitch at his place to go over the plan and "rehearse" our parts. Mitch was a pretty methodical guy, and he liked to cover all the bases and leave no margin for error or any unexpected surprises.

October passed and November arrived. Halloween decorations came down and were replaced with cut-out Pilgrims and Turkeys heralding the approach of Thanksgiving.

The night before the job, we met up one last time at Mitch's apartment to go over everything. He showed us a map of the area with the girl's boarding school circled in blue and the spot where we were supposed to grab her marked in red, thirty miles South.

The girl's limo was scheduled to pick her and leave the school at 3 p.m. tomorrow, after the last day of classes before Thanksgiving break. There would be one guard in the backseat with the girl and one in the front passenger seat. Estimating their mileage, and allowing for any traffic (Holiday travelers) that might slow them down (and assuming there were no pit stops on the way) Mitch calculated they would arrive at our location in roughly an hour. He would be parked at a rest stop a mile north of us watching the highway and would notify us by walkie talkie when he spotted the limo.

At which point we would intercept the limo. Kenny would be dressed as a road worker, with signs blocking the road. Me and Wyatt would be hiding off on either side of the road. When the driver got out to ask us what was going on, we would go into action. Kenny would draw on the driver and make him get down on the ground before zip-tying his hands behind his back. Simultaneously, me and Wyatt would come up from behind the limo. Wyatt would open the rear door, and pull his gun on the guard in the backseat with the girl. I would handle the one in the passenger seat.

After we disarmed the guards, we would zip-tie them as well, along with the girl. By then Mitch would be on his way back. He'd pick us up, make the call to the girl's father, and we would be on our way to the cabin. And that was it. After we arrived at our destination all we had to do was wait for The Russian to call Mitch and let him know the money had been transferred.

Sounds simple, doesn't it?

But you know what they say about the best laid plans of mice and men...

Things didn't go as smoothly as we had planned. In fact, it was pretty much a total fucking disaster.

And it was all that sick fuck Wyatt's fault.

I never did like or trust that bastard. Kenny was OK, even if he was a little flaky and tightly wound. The kind of guy who seems to be perpetually nervous and jumps at the slightest noise. He was still pretty young and green, but was a reliable guy all the same.

Wyatt on the other hand...

I only worked with him once before, on the first bank heist I ever pulled for the Russian. It's a miracle that didn't turn into a bloodbath because of him. You ever see *Reservoir* *Dogs*? Mr. Blonde? That was pretty much Wyatt, except Wyatt was even worse. He had these wild eyes that always had this crazy gleam in them, kind of like Charles Manson, and this leering, soulless smile that gave me the creeps. He reminded me of this fucked-in-the-head kid I knew in fifth grade who would go into a pet store, buy a goldfish in a plastic bag, then take it out around back and smash it against the wall as hard as he could...and if the fish survived the impact, he'd stand there watching as it flopped around on the ground until it died.

He was sociopath with a hair-trigger temper and poor impulse control, the type who could turn into a loose cannon at the slightest provocation, the kind of guy who'd shoot you just to watch you die. He was a killer, just like Mitch, but unlike Mitch, who only killed people if it was "business," Wyatt did it for fun. As a teen, he had been arrested for shooting a middle-aged couple to death in the convenience store they owned, and then attempting to rape their daughter in a hold-up that had gone wrong. He probably would have gotten life except that his scumbag lawyer got him off on some bullshit technicality or other. The police also suspected him in six other killings. "If they knew how many it really was," he confided in us once, "they'd lock me up till the end of time," then he smirked gloatingly, which made my blood run cold.

I honestly don't know why the Russian would have entrusted this job to someone as unstable as he was.

If it hadn't been for Wyatt, things might have turned out differently.

It started off according to plan.

Me, Kenny and Wyatt were huddled behind a tree off to the side of the road. We were out in the country, in the middle of nowhere, in a small wooded area in otherwise vast and open farm land. The nearest town was over five miles south of us. It was a chilly, overcast late fall day. Most of the trees were bare, a windy rain storm the previous night having denuded them of their remaining autumn foliage.

Wyatt was chain-smoking the non-filtered Pall Malls he favored (being careful to deposit the butts in his jacket pocket instead of tossing them in the ground, to avoid leaving evidence) and Kenny, who was something of a comic book/superhero geek, was in the middle of telling us some long-winded spiel about how Superman was an allegory for Jesus Christ. Neither of us were paying much attention to him. I kept peering around from our cover to scan the highway which wound through the trees. We had been in position for over an hour, and several vehicles had passed, but none of them were our target. Besides, Mitch was at his spot a mile up the road acting as the lookout, and he'd let us know when they were on the way.

Wyatt finally got fed up with Kenny's Superman/Christ comparison and flatly told him to shut the fuck up, which he did, falling silent.

Suddenly, the two-way radio clipped to my belt crackled to life, causing us to jump. I answered it and Mitch's filtered, slightly staticky voice said the words we had been waiting for:

"They're coming."

I felt a surge of adrenalin. Nervous anticipation that this moment we had been waiting and planning for for almost a month had finally arrived. I was also extremely scared.

I exchanged looks with my two accomplices, our faces suddenly tense, and wordlessly, we got ready. Kenny, wearing a road worker's hardhat and reflective yellow vest (which Mitch had supplied him with), kissed the silver St. Christopher's medal he wore around his neck (a gift from his now-dead mother that he always wore before a job as a good-luck charm) then  picked up one of those sawhorses with the diagonal black and white stripes and flashing lights they use to block the road during construction (which Mitch had also supplied him with) and dragged it out from behind the tree, positioning it in the middle of the road, then went back for the orange rubber cones that went with it, placing one on either side. Then he just waited there.

Me and Wyatt took black ski masks out of our jackets and pulled them over our heads, then Wyatt checked the magazine of his Beretta nine mil and I checked the magazine of my 1911A1 .45, then we nodded to each other and he ran across the road, hiding in the brush on the other side, just opposite the tree.

My heart was pounding with the suspense. I waited for what felt like an eternity. Finally I heard the sound of an approaching motor, getting louder as it drew closer. I peeked around the tree and saw what we had been waiting for -- a black, late model Cadillac limousine coming around a curve a quarter mile away,  heading our way.

I checked my pistol to make sure the safety was off.

I heard the limousine slow down and come to a stop on the other side of my hiding place and idle there. Then a door open and the sound of feet walking across the asphalt.

"What the fuck is this shit?" a man -- the driver, I presumed -- asked in a tone of exasperated annoyance to Kenny.

Then I heard the sound of a gun -- Kenny's .357 Magnum Smith & Wesson -- being cocked and the driver, his tone suddenly more docile, all traces of annoyance gone, said "Whoa! Easy there!"

"Get down on the ground, now!" Kenny shouted, his voice slightly shaky, betraying his nervousness and apprehension.

I took a deep breath. It was showtime. I stepped out from behind the tree and made a beeline for the passenger-side door of the limo. Wyatt was already heading for the rear door, gun in hand.

I yanked the passenger-side door open at the same moment Wyatt did likewise to the rear door. A huge beefy man in a dark Armani suit, hand already reaching into his jacket for a shoulder holster, jerked his head towards me with a wide-eyed expression of surprise.

I shoved the .45 in his face and shouted: "PUT UP YOUR HANDS!"

That was when everything turned to shit.

I was going to instruct the guard to get out of the limo, disarm him, then have him lie down in the road and bind his hands behind him with the zip ties in my pocket, but it never got further than me demanding he put up his hands.

Four deafening gunshots erupted from the rear of the limo, followed by the shrill, high-pitched, horrified scream of a young woman.

I jumped, startled, and jerked my head to look.

On the other side of the limo, Wyatt was aiming his now smoking Beretta into the rear seat. I could see him grinning through the mouth hole of his ski mask.

"Wyatt, what the FUCK?" I shouted at him, stunned. I realized a second too late we weren't supposed to use our real names to address each other. I glanced in the back, but the glass divider that separated the front and back seats was tinted too dark for me to see what had happened. I had a good idea, though.

"No choice! He pulled his piece on me!" Wyatt screamed.

I looked back at the guard in the front passenger seat and saw that while my attention had been diverted, he had reached into his coat, unsnapped the strap over his Glock, and had it halfway out of his holster. Another second and he would have blown me away.

Instinctively, I leaned in and whipped him savagely across the face with the barrel of my .45, the sight at the front of the barrel opening a gash in his cheek. He grunted in pain and went slack, hand falling away from his pistol.

"Shit!" I muttered, then reach in and yanked his Glock away and threw it into the woods (the three of us were wearing gloves to prevent leaving fingerprints).

I aimed my gun back in the dazed bodyguard's bleeding face and was once again going to demand he get out and lie on the ground when there was another feminine scream from the back of the limo. I glanced over.

Wyatt was leaning in and struggling to drag the girl out over the body of the rear seat bodyguard. He suddenly yelled in pain and recoiled, clutching his gloved right hand. "Bitch bit me!" he screamed.

The rear door opposite Wyatt flew open and the girl, wearing a private school uniform, leaped out and started sprinting down the highway in the direction the limo had come from.

"FUCK!" I shouted and chased after her, quickly overcoming her and tackling her to the ground. She squirmed and struggled beneath me. Behind me I heard three more gunshots ring out, followed by a cry of pain, then one more shot. Occupied with the kicking, thrashing girl beneath me, I didn't pay it much attention. "Gimme a hand here!" I yelled at Wyatt.

I heard Wyatt running over and he helped me restrain her long enough for me to fumble the zip ties out of my pocket and fasten her hands together behind her back. Then I pulled out the pillowcase I had also brought and slipped it over her head.

I stood up, panting, and was shocked when Wyatt suddenly kicked the girl in the stomach twice with savage brutality, his face contorted with rage. "That's for biting my hand, you bitch!" he snarled.

"Hey, cut that out!" I shouted at him just as he was cocking his foot back for a third kick. I glanced back to see what that shooting had been about and saw the body of the second bodyguard lying sprawled facedown on the side of the road.

I shot Wyatt a hard stare and he just shrugged nonchalantly. "He tried to run while you were dealing with her," he said, gesturing to the girl.

I looked over to Kenny, who was still standing in front of the limo in his road worker's vest and hardhat, a look of shock on his face, absently holding his revolver on the still-alive limo driver who was lying on his belly in the middle of the road with his hands spread out in front of him, hyperventilating. Kenny looked just like how I felt. I tried to wrap my mind around what had just happened, tried to make sense of it. Things had gotten fucked up so fast; everything I just described happened in less than two minutes. All our planning and scheming for what was supposed to have been a clean, no-one-gets-hurt job, had been for nothing. Now there were two people dead. It had all gone to hell in a handbasket.

Just then we heard the sound of another approaching engine.

"Oh, shit!" Kenny wailed, alarmed, tensing.

I glanced down the road. "Relax, it's just Mitch," I said, recognizing his Dodge Challenger. He drew closer and then slammed on his brakes, tires screeching to a halt, when he saw the corpse of the bodyguard lying beside the road.

His door flew open and he leap out of the car, appalled. "What the fuck is this?" he demanded, but there was no time for explanations, accusations or recriminations. We had to get the fuck out of there fast, before another motorist came along. "Never mind! Get in the fucking car, all of you! Ken, help me with her! We'll put her in the trunk!"

Kenny came over and together they lifted the whimpering girl and carried her to the back of the Challenger.

"What about him?" Wyatt asked, pointing to the limo driver.

"Just leave him!" Mitch replied.

That sick, chilling smile crept over Wyatt's face and he shook his head. "Uh-uh. No witnesses." And with that he drew his Beretta and strolled over to the driver.

"Hey!" Mitch protested, "what the fuck do you think you're--"

Three rapid gunshots interrupted him as Wyatt pumped three rounds into the limo driver's head. All three of us jumped.

"JESUS FUCKIN' CHRIST!" Mitch screamed at the top of his lungs, outraged and more pissed than I had ever seen him before. "YOU FUCKIN' PSYCHO! GET IN THE FUCKIN' CAR! NOW!" He looked to me. "Where's her purse? Is it still in the limo?"

I found my voice and stammered: "Y-yeah, I think so."

"Well get it and be quick!"

I raced back to the limo and looked in the back seat. Her purse, some leather designer number, was lying on the floor. I reached in and grabbed it up, then turned to head to Mitch's car...but I paused briefly and glanced at the bullet-ridden body of the guard who was slumped to his side in the back seat.

His jacket was hanging open, and I saw his Glock was still in its shoulder holster, the strap still fastened over the butt.

"Fuck," I muttered, then ran over and hopped into the back of Mitch's Challenger with Kenny.

Mitch got in the driver's seat and Wyatt got into the shotgun seat.

Mitch peeled out of there, leaving the carnage behind.

\*\*\*\*\*

We drove in silence for about half an hour. Wyatt sat glancing idly out at the passing scenery, as cool as could be, casually smoking one of his unfiltered Pall Malls, blowing the smoke out the cracked-open window. The rest of us were all pretty shaken up by what had happened. We all silently contemplated the botched abduction and the possible ramifications of it. No one was supposed to have gotten hurt. Now three people were dead -- executed in cold blood -- and we had a teenaged girl bound in the trunk.

Mitch was tense with rage the entire time, his fingers clinching the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles had turned white, his lips pressed tightly together, his jaw clenched.

He suddenly, unexpectedly slammed on the brakes and the Challenger screeched to a halt. I was certain he was going to haul off on Wyatt and beat the ever-loving shit out of him...but he didn't. Maybe even *he* was somewhat intimidated by the psychopath sitting beside him in the passenger seat. Instead he shouted in his face so loudly both Kenny and I, sitting in the back seat, winced.

"WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU THINK YOU WERE DOING?"

Wyatt didn't even flinch. He just kept puffing on his cigarette.

Mitch continued: "DID YOU FUCKIN DEVELOPE AMNESIA BETWEEN THE LAST MONTH AND THIS MORNING?! DID ALL THE PLANNING WE DID SLIP OUT THROUGH YOUR EAR WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING LAST NIGHT?! YOU HAD ORDERS! THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A CLEAN GRAB! NO ONE WAS SUPPOSED TO GET HURT!"

"I did us a favor," Wyatt replied in a bored, casual tone.

"HOW THE FUCK DO YOU FIGURE THAT, ASSHOLE?"

"Those guys were a loose end. They could have identified us."

"HOW SO? YOU WERE ALL WEARING FUCKING GLOVES AND MASKS!"

Wyatt suddenly pointed a finger to the back seat -- in my direction, taking me by surprise. "*This* genius said my real name while we were grabbing the chick. It might have stuck with them when they went to the cops. Wyatt ain't a very common name, you know. Then they could have narrowed it down and traced it back to me through my record and then they would have tracked us *all* down and we'd be fucked."

Mitch shot me a frown from the driver's seat. "That true?"

I fumbled for an excuse for a few seconds, then admitted with a sigh: "Yeah. I fucked up. Things got crazy and I wasn't thinking. I slipped." We were all supposed to use code names for the duration of the job. Mitch was Number One, Wyatt was Number Two, I was Three and Kenny was Four.

I saw Mitch roll his eyes in the rearview mirror in disgust. He shook his head and muttered "Jesus" under his breath, then said aloud: "Fucking bunch of amateurs."

"Besides," Wyatt added, "this might work to our advantage."

"In what fucking way?" Mitch demanded in a more calm tone of voice, but still extremely pissed.

"It shows how hardcore we are. That bitch's dad's gonna know we ain't fuckin around and he better play ball."

After that we drove for another ten minutes in silence. Our mood was somber. There was some logic in Wyatt's argument, but that didn't justify his cold-blooded murder of the three men in the limo. He had escalated things and taken them in an entirely new direction - a direction we hadn't wanted them to go. Our situation was more serious now. Kidnapping and extortion had been bad enough, but if they caught us, now we'd also be facing three counts of first-degree murder.

Mitch slowed down and pulled into the deserted parking lot of a long-abandoned gas station on the side of the road. He pulled a pair of latex gloves out of his pocket and put them on. Then he popped over the glove box and took out one of those electronic voice changers (like the type used by the killers in *Scream*). He glanced back at me and Kenny. "Hand me the purse, then shut the fuck up for a couple minutes. I'm placing the call."

Kenny handed him the girl's purse and Mitch dug around inside until he found her smartphone. He scrolled through her contacts until he found one labeled "Daddy". He pressed it, then listened for a couple moments before there was an answer on the other end. He spoke through the voice changer and his voice came through unnaturally deep and slightly filtered. It was creepy, like listening to a robot talking.

"We have your daughter," Mitch said. I heard a muffled, inaudible voice begin to reply on the phone but Mitch cut it off. "Shut the fuck up and listen. You want to see her alive again, follow these instructions exactly. I want one hundred million U.S. dollars transferred electronically into the following bank account..." He gave the girl's father the long account number the Russian had given him to memorize. "Once the money's been deposited, she goes free. You have seventy-two hours. If you don't pay, she's dead. Don't go to the police or the FBI. You are being watched."

(That last bit was total bullshit, of course. The guy wasn't being watched and we didn't really expect him to *not* go to the authorities; it just seemed like like standard ransom kidnapper etiquette; the kind of thing they always say in the movies.)

Mitch ended the call, then got out of the car, taking the girl's phone and purse across the cracked, weedy parking lot. He placed both on the ground, then smashed the phone into pieces with a big rock, and then, for good measure, doused both it and the purse with lighter fluid and set them on fire with his Zippo.

"Well, that's that," he said, getting back in the driver's seat. "The hard part's over. Now we just gotta wait."

We drove West, out of the country and into the suburbs, then through a city. On the outskirts of the city Mitch turned onto the interstate and gradually the gas stations, fast food joints and strip mall fell away, replaced one again with open country, barren and desolate on this gray, late-fall afternoon. After about an hour, Mitch got off the interstate onto another highway and open farm land gave way to increasing thick wilderness. The sun began to set and nightfall descended. Mitch switched on his headlights. We drove for about twenty minutes, then Mitch pulled onto a small, unpaved dirt road running directly through the woods.

Our destination was a small cabin five miles from the nearest town, out in the middle of nowhere where no one would give us any trouble. Mitch had rented the place a week ago for a month, paying cash and using a fake name. He had gotten the place cheap because it had a pretty fucked-up past -- a few years before, some dumb kids had come up there to celebrate their high school graduation, only one of them had gone nuts and murdered his friends before disposing of the bodies and taking off. He had left some bizarre journal or something explaining that some blood-thirsty monster had killed his friends and had him trapped in the cabin. None of the bodies had ever been found, and the killer was still at large.

The road grew narrower and more overgrown the deeper into the woods we drove, the trees pressing in close and looming over Mitch's Challenger on either side. I started feeling a little creeped out, dwelling on Mitch's story of this place.

Eventually, the cabin appeared in the distance, tiny at first, but getting bigger as we approached. Finally, Mitch stopped the car, shut off the engine, and we were there.

"We're here," he said unnecessarily.

None of us said anything. We just sat regarding the small, run-down cabin we would be staying at for the next few days.

"This place looks fuckin creepy," Wyatt muttered at last, breaking the silence.

"Yeah," I agreed from the backseat. "I feel like any second Leatherface is gonna pop out wielding a chainsaw at us."

"I dunno," Kenny disagreed, "this place looks more like the cabin from *The Evil Dead."*

"Some fucked up shit did happen here a few years back," Mitch explained to Kenny, who hadn't heard about the place's past.

"What kind of fucked up shit?" Kenny asked, intrigued.

"Never mind that right now," Mitch said, opening his door, "let's just get the girl inside and get settled in."

We got out, putting our ski masks back on, and gathered around the trunk. Mitch opened it. The girl was curled up on her side, whimpering softly, the pillowcase still covering her head. Her skirt had hiked up some, revealing most of her legs up to her thighs. I glanced at Wyatt and caught him leering at this and felt a flash of dismay. This freak wasn't just a killer, after all; he was a sex offender.

Mitch also caught him ogling her exposed legs and told him in a hard, threatening voice: "Don't even fuckin *think* about it." Then he said to the girl: "We're taking you out of the trunk. Don't fucking kick or fight or you'll be sorry." He turned to me. "Give me a hand."

I helped Mitch lift the girl out of the trunk and we carried her to the cabin. Mitch told me to set her down for a second so he could fumble the keys out of his back pocket and unlock the door. Then we took her inside.

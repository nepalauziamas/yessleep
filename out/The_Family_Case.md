The \[REDACTED\] Police Station received a call from a secluded house out in the middle of nowhere. It was a crying woman saying that there were people walking around her house and peeking in through windows.

The police rushed over, but when they got there a woman came to the door and told them that she hadn’t made a single call that day. They still searched the house but found nothing.

The investigation was forgotten until a month later when they received a call from a man stating that his friend had not responded to his calls or texts after 2 weeks, and he was beginning to grow worried.

So The police drove over to the address the man gave them and found it to be the same house that they had gotten the previous call from. The same woman answered the door and brought her husband too, showing that the man was fine, and must have just not seen his texts or calls.

That, of course was very unlikely, but the police could not investigate further without a warrant, and the incident was again forgotten.

Until the spring, when the parent of a child said that he’d gone to his friend’s house after their trip to Mexico and saw a woman he didn’t recognize in the window.

The police again arrived at the home they had been to twice before and found the same man and woman at the door. They told them that they had two daughters, no sons. The police were growing more suspicious every new time they were called to the house, so they dug up the house’s history to see who bought it. 

Apparently, the house had been bought by a family a few years ago, and the real estate agent who sponsored the house lived in the next town over.

The police found her address and drove to the house, only to be told by a man who was apparently her husband that she had died in her sleep not long after the house was sold.

The case had again hit a dead end and was dropped.

. . . 

7 months later, when the authorities were notified by the bank that a house owner going by the name of Anne Jacobs had not been paying off the mortgage on her house for the past year. They had sent her many letters reminding her, but they never received an answer.

So for the third time, the police visited the old house and knocked on the door. This time, no one came. They eventually forced their way into the house and found that the whole place was caked in dust. There was furniture in odd places and all of the drapes were shut.

When they investigated upstairs, they found even more disturbing things. There was only one bedroom that looked like it belonged to a boy, not a girl, and there was a horrible smell coming from the master bedroom. 

Inside the bedroom was a filthy stuffed bear on the ground and what forensics teams later determined to be horse teeth on a plate near the door, some bloodied tissue was still clinging to the tooth, indicating they had been forcefully removed.

The officers who made the discovery called in backup and waited for the FBI to inspect the house. Most of the things the FBI uncovered were classified, but public information confirmed that the original owner of the house, Anne Jacobs, and her husband, Steve Jacobs' remains were found beneath some damaged tiles in the kitchen. Some bones were missing, such as fingers and a jaw, but their son, Teddy Jacobs was nowhere to be found.

Also missing were the two people who came to the door previously, and their two daughters. Strangely there were no fingerprints found on anything in the house except for those of the deceased owners.

To this day, the authorities have no idea what events transpired in the house and who those people were who the cops had spoken with. And more importantly, where did they go?

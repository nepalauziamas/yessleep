Hey everyone, Naissance here. It’s a weird name, I know. It’s been a while.

I had a strange dream last night. I dreamt I fell into a deep, dark abyss. I flailed, struggling to keep my sense of direction as I tumbled through the darkness. I could see nothing, just black. It was just me and the all-consuming dark. And then, I hit water. I sank through the liquid slowly as the weight piled on top of me. I could not open my mouth. I could not swim. I could not see. I just let myself sink further and further. I remember feeling… calm. Satisfied even. Full of contentment of what I had achieved thus far. It felt like I had descended for hours. So when my feet touched the soft, fleshy bottom of that impossibly deep abyss— I was glad that I had found the bottom. I was glad that I made it to the end. I was fulfilled. 

That’s when I felt the hands slithering up my ankles like snakes, making their way towards my limbs, torso, and head. When they started pulling on me, submerging me further still, I was terrified at the implications. What ungodly horrors awaited me down there, in the deepest parts of the earth? What would be my fate? I clawed and struggled in vain, eventually giving up entirely. I would be going down under soon. 

When my head descended past the floor of that deep abyss, I saw light. I turned towards the window in my familiar home. I was in bed. It was morning.

This dream shook me. A seamless transition between waking and dreaming. A true feat of our brain's ability to alter our sense of reality. That being said, the abyss in my dream was alluring, in a way. I knew it was because of the tapes. My entire being was screaming at me to stop looking into this, that I was uncovering a primeval, ancient horror better left untouched. I knew I should stop. But I *needed* to find out more. I *knew* there was more to this. And I was going to find out.

MAN: *Through the forest?*

MAN: *What happened in the forest?*

NATALIE: I was… just a girl. Eleven, maybe. Pa didn’t usually take so long in town, so I figured somethin’ mighta happened. Maybe he got lost in the— well, you get it. 

MAN: *Then what happened?*

NATALIE: I knew the way up to our house was real dangerous at night. A few drops here and there. Tumble a bit and you could roll down a hill or somethin’ and get hurt real bad. I reckon I got scared he coulda fell, so I got a light and went down the path to look for ‘em. I couldn’t see that well, but about halfway down the path, I found somethin’. 

MAN: *What did you find?*

NATALIE: Well… I—

\[STATIC\]

NATALIE:  —and I had never seen no tree like that before down the path. A giant Beech tree, down at the bottom of a hill. I saw broken sticks and branches. That’s when I knew for sure he fell. I was scared he hit his head on somethin’. I didn’t see no one down there though. Figured he mighta broken somethin’  and was crawlin’ away to try and get some help. I made my way down there, and that’s when I heard somethin’. 

MAN: *Heard what?*

NATALIE: Screamin. Lot’s of screamin. It sounded like the screamin’ of a cornered animal. I was scared, mister. I ain’t never heard no one scream like that before. But I had to find my poppa. So I came up to that tree to check it out.

\[PAUSE\]

NATALIE: There was a big hole there, mister. It went under the tree. It was like a burrow or somethin’. But it didn’t just go under the tree. It went almost straight down, like a pit. That’s where I heard the screamin’. It didn’t sound like pa. But a man was yelling from down there. Yellin’ for somebody. I tried to light it up, but It was so dark down there. I still couldn’t see nothin’. I yelled back, “Poppa! Are you down there? Did you fall? Poppa!” No response. But I still heard ‘em. I thought maybe it was him, I couldn’t tell. It sounded like it was comin’ from real deep in that hole. Like he was yellin’ through straight rock. I woulda gone to town to get help just like that, ‘cept… 

MAN: *Except what?*

NATALIE: The pit— It wanted me down there. It was pullin’ me in. I felt this urge, this urge to just dive right in and keep goin’. It scared me. All the while, that man’s screamin’ was gettin’ louder. Then—

\[PAUSE\]

NATALIE: I thought I saw somethin’ crawl out of that hole, mister. It was covered in blood. Pullin’ itself out. It looked like hands. Comin’ towards me. 

MAN: *You saw hands?*

NATALIE: Yessir. Or, I thought I did. It was dark after all. I hightailed it out of there as fast as I could. Tripped on a branch after I saw that thing, hit the side of my head on the ground. I heard the man underground keep yellin someone’s name then. That’s how I knew it wasn’t poppa. That wasn’t me or me late ma’s name.

MAN: *Who was it?*

NATALIE: He kept yellin’ for Clara. I don’ know a Clara.

I… don’t remember this happening in the tape. I don’t. I’ve listened to all of the recordings at least once. I transcribed them before the files were corrupted when I uploaded them into the university’s database the first time. This tape ended right after the man asked her about the forest. I know this for sure. The rest was static. I thought I was going crazy before, but this is just like some parts of the last recording. These tapes have changed. How could this person hear Stevens’ last words from a hole in *Maine*? Not too mention, this tape is dated in 1969, with her retelling a story from her childhood— this simply wasn’t possible. I couldn’t reason this away as anything other than a hoax, or false labeling. Maybe she wasn’t from Maine? They did say she was a patient after all. The more I sought a reasonable explanation, the more unjustifiable those explanations became.

I wanted to pursue a more active role in all of this. I wondered why the university even had these tapes in its possession in the first place. I wanted to discern their connection in any way that I could. I laid the seven cassettes out in front of me. 1A, ‘Arrowhead’. 1B, ‘Recovery’. 1C, Untitled. 2A, ‘The Forest’. 3A, ‘Decline’. 4A, ‘Concrete’. 4B, ‘Whiteout’. I wanted to know more, and I thought it was suspicious that the files only got corrupted when I used university equipment. This happened with my upload, and later with the copier. I decided to poke around a bit. 

In my first post, I noted that there were no tunnels in Hillview. That was true enough, at least to the effect of old, underground tunnels that were “built a long time ago” during the 80s. There are, however, a short series of maintenance tunnels connecting the administrative building and library. I neglected to mention this because, well, the university was built in the late 90s. It couldn’t be those maintenance tunnels. Regardless, I think it was time to check it out. The problem was, I didn’t have a key, nor did I have a great excuse for getting down there.

It took some sleuthing, but I eventually found out that the administrative building kept a spare set of keys down there in security. I knew the late night security guard, Jared. He was a bit aloof. A young guy who could care less about things. He was dependable enough though. I could tell you guys that I planned some grand heist, knocked out some guards, broke into the security room and stole the keys— but I won’t. My plan was a bit simpler.

“Hey Jared.”

“Hey Miss M.”

“Y’know, I've been wanting to use the maintenance tunnels as a shortcut to the library. Can I use the spare keys?”

“What? I’m not gonna give you the keys for tha— you know what, fuck it. Just don’t tell anyone.”

“Thanks Jared.”

It pays to know the right people.

After work, I gathered my things. A flashlight, water, some food, and a crowbar. Hey, if I found what I was looking for I needed something to protect myself with. And who knows how long I’d be exploring if I did. To be completely honest, I didn’t know what I should bring. I figured over preparing was better than nothing at all. 

The tunnel was surprisingly well lit. An almost straight shot to the library tunnel entrance. A maze of pipes lined the left side, made of copper, plastic, or other miscellaneous metal. On the right, a solid wall of concrete. I could get to the other side in less than 5 minutes. I walked the distance 10, maybe 20 times— I couldn’t find anything. There were no twists and turns. No hidden paths. I checked behind the pipes. Nothing obscured. Nothing plastered over. Just the buzzing of the lights overhead. I sighed. As I was about to turn back to leave, I stupidly tripped over my own feet. I panicked, using my arms to break the fall on the hard concrete. 

I fell a bit hard, almost hitting the side of my head. If I had, and knocked myself out, there was no telling how long it would take for someone to find me down here. I thought of the girl in the tape, when she fell. I felt silly for tripping in such a way, when I heard it. It was such a subtle sound. Barely noticeable beyond the whirring of the lights above. So faint it could have been a soft whisper from far away. It came from below, as if someone was yelling straight through rock. I pressed my ear against the ground, and heard, so faintly, the voice of a little girl.

“Poppa! Are you down there?”

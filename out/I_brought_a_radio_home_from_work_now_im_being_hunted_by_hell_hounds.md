  

this happened two nights ago and im a bit lost so I suppose I should just give context. I had just finished my bleak as fuck shift at work. I was so tired leaving I forgot to turn in my walkie talkie that I had comfortably forgotten I had clipped to my belt. no biggie right, no its a massive fucking biggie I just figured hey I’ll go in on my 1 day off tomorrow, sure my uptight boss might get a bit annoyed but sure they have plenty surplus. so, I didn’t want my plans consisting of a glass or bottle of merlot ruined by this minor although bothersome conundrum so I started drinking and turned on rings of power. about 30 minutes in the walkie talkie started to give off static.

 Of course this frightened me out my skin for a quick second but it soon passed so I just summed it up to picking up a random signal. It soon slipped out of my mind, so once another unsatisfying episode ended, I pulled my bed sheet over my shoulders trying to escape the cold and the merlot did its job of making me drift into a cosy alcohol induced coma. only to be awoken again by more static, by this time I was warm and comfortable so my frustration was immeasurable, eventually giving up on my attempt to sleep through it I got up and took the batteries out as I needed my beauty sleep. I was then woken up yet again more angry than ever but something about the static sounded off.

 ehm how do I put it I guess if I had to pick a word it would be, energetic? ya that’s the right word for it energetic. I got up to take the batteries out. only to catch myself in a sudden moment of horror pulling me out of my all to comfortable and tipsy grog. the tension stiffened me I felt my self-get hot and like every stupid ass horror movie victim I reached for the walkie talkie it was hot to the touch. Not just hot but like hot hot. like a cougar after lingerie shopping hot. I pushed the button and in some hope of using comedy to relieve some of the tension I did my best impression of radio static back into it followed by a "HUH not so funny is IT!!!" after I let go of the button and let out a nervous awkward chuckle it remained silent for a second until a faint "hello, hello can you hear me" the voice was young not quite a full blown child maybe like a young teenager like 13 or 14.

 "please answer me" the voice was desperate so I responded. "He-hello, how are you talking to me". radio cracked alive again it made my skin crawl I swung my head side to side to see if I was still drunk not that it would make me feel any better my little test conclude with a strong yes. from here on out since I don’t know who she was I will instead refer to her as radio. Radio respond with a "oh thank god you’re real I’ve been trying for weeks to get someone" "i pressed down, what do you mean and how are you talking to me there’s no batteries." a simple low voiced response came through "shit". 

I was about to ask how but she came back through almost yelling " put the batteries in and hide, they know where you are and they will find you so listen "I went to press the button again but something stopped me some primal urge or third eye or maybe it was the god damn spaghetti monster stopped me. I shoved the batteries in and responded. "ya there in, what did you mean there coming for me, who’s coming for me. the CIA the Feds who!". " no nothing like that just dont be dumb and youll be okay, and by dumb i mean do anything i don’t directly tell you to." i responded "ok WHAT DO I FUCKING DO" she respond with words through clearly gritted teeth "GIVE ME A SEC-ONED,,, Ok go to ur attick take the turn key with you hide on one of the beems behind the boiler u need as little path way to you as possible use the old christmas decorations to cover the walking boards". "wait how did you know about the" she broke through some how getting her own signal "havent you been listening GO NOW" i followed as ordered grabbing my phone as i did so the attic was dusty the insulation irritated my skin where my fingers slipped in crawling on the beems.

 "ok im here what now". radio responded "be as quiet as possible they have good hearing even better sight keep the lights off i cant risk contacting for now, if you survive them i will call you in 3 days dont respond anymore" i was about to put the radio in my pocket when a light crackle came through "i hope you survive for both our sakes goodbye" and at that silence. i stayed quiet as ordered for about an hour, well i think an hour i was keeping my phone off it could have been less or more. i was expecting a cop raid on my house but that would have been better it would have been so much fucking better. it started as a low growl beneath the growls were similer to gurgling but with more teeth if that makes sense like a deep pur with a hint of wet anger i was hiper fixated on the attic opening when a big bang on the roof came through and then the clacks of footsteps on the tiles eventually every direction around me was filled with thuds and growls and the occasional clomp of teeth. my heart raced so fast i would have failed a medical test through heart rate alone i was scared they would hear my breathing so i started holding my breath but this only exacerbated my breath each time my weak ass body gave in to its need for oxygen the breaths became heavier.

 eventually i heard rythmic thuds a bit ahead of me I felt weak when I realised it was underneath the attic hatch. until a creek of light came through they had pulled the sting for my attic down revealing the flooding light into the attic i turned away leaning my back against the boiler its heat burning through my hoodie. i covered my mouth and stared at the opposite wall the thing jumped up and the rest of the noise disappeared around me all that was left was the distinct clack of nails on the wood walk way and low growling as it patroled up and down it grunts getting frustrated, 

all the while my breathing through my nose simultaneously became hastened as the skin on my back went from first to second degree burns. the creature leaned its head past the boiler its breath moving my hair it was disturbingly similar to a horses breath. tears rolled down my face and snot built up on my hand I felt a shine of acceptance come over me as its putrid breath reeking like an emptied fridge filled with shit was left in hot summer weather. but a final blow of air came out and i heard it scamper away my body went limp. i stayed where i was only readjusting my back from the boiler for another few hours until finally deciding to to grow big enough balls to leave the attic by the time I got down it was around 12am 

, i don’t know what happened or if it was all some hallucination or worse a military experiment. all i know is ill be sleeping in my attic for the foreseeable future. please if ye have any idea what is going on please let me know. I will make another post if i do get the call tomorrow.

So, I have the average dream here and there, mostly no dreams at all, but there have been some dreams where I wake up and I’m like “Was that a dream, or was it real.”

Today, I’ve gotten my answer, and I wish I never did.

Lemme backtrack to the beginning of these realistic dreams, I’ve been feeling things my 5 senses in my dreams, very vividly. They bleed into my dreams after a while and I just can’t prevent it. My first weird dream was stubbing my toe on the brick fireplace in my living room, and I felt the pain even after I woke up, it left me wondering “What just happened, why am I hurt.”

After about 10 minutes or so, my toe was sort of swollen.

My second dream, it was worse than my toe stubbing one. I had hit my head like, really hard on the underside of my table (has a little hanging part that has a sharp corner) from standing up, like to the point of dizziness and needing to sit down. A few minutes later I wake up and feel the exact same way.

Third dream, I fell and hit my face on the ground, woke up to a bruise on my face and soreness.

Now, I’ve seen too many psychological horror movies and try to rationalize it. I keep telling myself “Your brain just feels it in your dream and believes it to be real, so it reacts accordingly with real life actions.”

But, I don’t think that’s the case anymore, and here is the dream that did it in for me, making me realize I was burdened with such an idiotic reality.

I’m gonna skip to current day (since you got the gist of what I mean)

I was in my house, home alone, when I hear noises outside, I go to check through the window and that’s when I see a man, standing around 10 feet away from the window, pointing towards my backdoor.


I hear it open and turn to the feeling of leather gloves on my face and the pressing of cold metal against my neck, to the point of drawing blood. Right before the intruder moved his blade and ended me in that spot, I woke up in a cold sweat, my neck with a sharp pain.

I feel something slowly creeping down my neck so I move my hand down to wipe it away, thinking it’s sweat, when I feel the weird sensation of a viscous liquid and take my hand up to see it, I wish I never did now, and I wish it never happened.


It was blood, this was when I realized what was really going on. It wasn’t just mental pain, but physical, to the point of my body actually taking physical damage.

My body is trying to kill me as I sleep and I don’t know how to stop it. I haven’t slept and I fear that if I do, my body will finally finish me off, I’ll try my best to fend off the sleep and keep you updated, if I even make it past this night.

I had to go back to work the next day since I had already been off a week to help my family recover. 

Every night when I got home, I was told of the degression of Marcus. The therapist was coming over every day to talk and comfort him. 

The news from her was grim. 
“He won’t get out of bed every time I try to talk to him. He barely acknowledges me and won’t even take his head out from under his covers.”
Andrea and I exchanged a glance. 
“If this gets any worse, I recommend taking him to a mental health center.” 
Andrea and I exchanged another long glance and I squeezed her hand in an attempt to reassure her. I could tell she wasn’t taking the news well. I think she blamed herself.

We contemplated sending him to the therapist’s recommended facility for a few days, but before we could make up our minds, Marcus emerged from his room and came to confront us in the living room. I hadn’t seen him since I went back to work because every time I tried to talk to him, he wouldn’t even turn to look at me.

His appearance shook me. Not only was he extremely pale and clammy like he had been, but his eyes were bulging out and almost a pure red from lack of sleep. When I looked closer, his skin appeared more grey than just pale. 

I finally realized the extreme severity of his problem. He needed institutionalized and put on suicide watch. I could tell that his grasp on society was fading. He was already far beyond the level Andrea and I could handle. 

I caught Andrea’a eye and she was horrified. But before she or I could open our mouths, Marcus spoke. He didn’t just speak though, he . . . growled, pointing a long, thin, ashy finger at Andrea. His fingernails were long and sharp from lack of care. 
“You killed me”
. . .
“YOU KILLED ME YOU FUCKING BITCH!”
He was practically hissing at us. Spit sprayed everywhere. His resemblance to some biblical demon was startlingly apparent. 

And then he lunged towards Andrea, fingernail-claws swinging with clear intent to mangle. Luckily I and my dad were able to intervene and keep him at bay while my mom called the police. Andrea had fallen backwards during the commotion and was crying on the floor next to the couch. 

My heart was pounding out of my chest, and I felt practically sick. What the fuck was going on? He couldn’t actually be possessed could he? 

We held him in place while he hissed horrific words at us until the police arrived. It had barely been a week since we had last seen them. They took Marcus away while we filled out yet another police report. 

He was judged criminally insane and sent to a forensic psychiatric hospital where they would attempt to help him. 

At first, he was put into a high security ward, but miraculously, he began improving quickly. He was quickly moved into lower and lower security level wards as the weeks progressed.

Andrea visited him every day during the morning while I was at work, and we both visited him later that night. We were relieved by his improvement. At this rate, we would have our son back in no time. 

After being off work for 3 more weeks, I had to go back in order to keep my job. I was content with the state all of my family was in and went back willingly. My wife was still with my parents, and they focused on her happiness like no one else could have. My son was recovering in the care of extremely educated and passionate people. It was the best I had felt in the last month.

That all ended that Thursday when I got a call from the police station while I was at work. I wish I had been there. I SHOULD have been there. I SHOULD have learned. I SHOULD have fucking learned the first time that I always needed to be their for my family. But I wasn’t, and I’ll regret it for the rest of my life however long that might last.

The last part of this story will be told through the police report and all the information I’ve been given by the police station and witness testimonies. I like to imagine it as a well written book so I can forget that it happened to my family. I know this will be confusing but I’m going to refer to Andrea and Marcus by the pseudonyms Charlotte and Tucker from now on. It’s the only way I can cope, imagining them as a completely different family.

I can’t guarantee the accuracy of this next part, but it’s all I have. All of this is based off of my knowledge of my wife’s character, and my son’s recent behavior. 

As I’ve said already, Tucker was recovering at a remarkable pace. An unbelievable pace.

That Thursday morning was a particularly depressing day. Rain poured down heavily and thunder roared in the sky above. The storm was so dense that the streetlights came on at 9:00 AM. 

And on that depressing morning, Tucker broke out of the hospital. He seemed so well-recovered that everyone in the hospital mistook him as just some kid visiting an older relative. He easily walked out of the hospital into the downpour. He quickly caught a ride from an old woman who was piteous of him, for he was just a kid coatless and alone in a thunderstorm. He gave her directions to his house, and she drove him there, making small talk on the way. 
“Who were you visiting at the hospital if you don’t mind me asking?”
“Oh, I was just going to see my grandpa since we got out of school because of the storm,” he answered politely, and the woman had no reason to question the story because the schools had, in fact, just been let out early. 

When he arrived at the house, he thanked his driver graciously, then walked around back, grabbed the hidden key and let himself inside. He hadn’t given the old woman the address to his grandparents house, for he had something to obtain here first.

The inside smelled musty and almost rotten due to its vacancy. There was still a massive pool of blood soaked into the carpet that had yet to be cleaned up. No one had thought to hire a forensic specialist, and no one had been back to the house to do it themselves. 

Seeing the spilt blood of Nero brought a flare into his heart, but now was not the time for anger. That would come soon. 

He respectfully stepped over the blood stains and proceeded towards the back of the house where he had one goal in mind: take the gun that killed Nero . . . and even the score. 

He left the house at 9:37 AM and began the long walk to his grandparents house. No one was willing to offer an armed child a ride this time.

He arrived outside his grandparents house at 10:42 AM. He did not go up to the house but stayed and waited outside, out of line-of-sight of the house and the road. Charlotte would leave to visit him in about half an hour. That’s when he would make his presence known.

When that moment came, he did as planned, but he kept the gun completely hidden so as not to make himself anymore suspicious. He had stuck it into the waistline of his pants, barreling facing upwards so that his body blocked it from view. 

Charlotte slammed on the breaks when she saw him - hard enough that they squeezed slightly. He could distinguish the surprise on her face even through the tint of her car’s window. He walked forward and opened the back door before she had time to get out of the car. She stammered out words as he seated himself in the car, but she could seem to make sense of the situation and how he was there.

That’s when he drew the gun and pointed it directly at her forehead. She froze up and tried to scream for help, but he silenced this scream by pressing the gun barrel to her forehead. 
“Don’t say a word you fucking murderer. Take me to the place you killed me,” he hissed out through clenched teeth. The rage he felt in her presence was immeasurable. But he must resist the violence. At least for now.

She drove, her hands shaking the entire time. Her breaths shook, and she often released little squeaks resembling hiccups. It was all from fear of him. He felt a swell of pride in his intimidation, but he could still barely resist the wait for the big finale. 

They arrived at the house, and Charlotte pulled the car into the garage as commanded. Tucker was practically shaking himself. Not with fear but anticipation mixed with excitement. 

“Get out of the car” 

She obeyed, keeping her hands above her head. As if she stood a chance even with a weapon. He audibly laughed which made Charlotte flinch. 

“Go inside.”

The order was obeyed immediately. 

“Go to the stains. Kneel on top of them,” he commanded. 

As Charlotte finally understood what her son was about to do to her, she finally began to plead with him. 
“Please don’t. Please. I’m your mother. I’d do anyth-“
He cut her off and released a demonic laugh. 
“Nothing you can say will change the fact that you took my life away from me. I owned that life. Now I own yours.”

It was hard to believe that Tucker was only 15 years old. His behavior, the air of authority, - it felt like being in the presence of an infamous serial killer.

She finally obeyed the order after finally realizing that her son did not belong to her anymore. She would do anything to save him, but that required complete sacrifice this time. 
“It’ll be quick?” She asked, finally kneeling in the pool of dried blood.
Another demonic laugh as he pressed his foot to her chest and kicked her over. Hard. 

“I love you,” Charlotte whispered as the gun was pressed deep into her stomach. 

“YOU MURDERED ME!” He roared. 

“I saved you,” she whispered again. “But please just forgive me. I would never do anything that would hurt you.” 

A silent tear rolled down her cheek. She was calm now, knowing she had done everything she could possibly do. 

“I DON’T GIVE A FUCK WHETHER YOU LOVE ME OR NOT. YOU END HERE IN THE STAINS OF YOUR SIN!” 

And then he pulled the trigger, barrel still planted deep in her stomach. Her innards practically exploded out of her torso.

When the blast subsided, her blood soaked into the carpet with Nero’s, and they became indistinguishable from one another. 

Tucker left the body, still carrying the gun. Every part of him was covered in blood. 

He left the house and went to sit on the street corner as the rain finally subsided. 

He was still sitting there when the police force arrived once again. His mission was fulfilled. This would be the last time the police would have to enter this house.

Now I sit trapped in my old childhood bedroom, unable to muster up the courage to leave. I had sold the house. I’ve since been fired from my job. My entire family has been destroyed. My parents try to empathize with me, but I have been intolerable with rage and grief. As hard as they try, they’re still drifting away from me. Soon I won’t have them either. My son’s still alive, but he will be in a highly guarded institute for the criminally insane for what looks to be the rest of his life. I am ruined. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to repair myself, and I know nothing will ever be the same or as good as it was before.

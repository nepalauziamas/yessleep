About a couple of mornings ago, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed. My coffee was more bitter than normal. My clothes for some reason didn't fit right.

I remember going to the grocery only for the OPEN sign to say CLOSED on me. Like I wasn't allowed there.

So I went to the convenience store, but no dice.

And when I went to work, I was told I needed a day off.

When I woke up yesterday, I decided to measure my weight on the scale I had, only for it to break. Like, what's going on? My coffee tasted like mud.

Tried to go to work, but they wouldn't let me in.

Tried to go shopping for food (I never ate the previous morning) only for it to close on me.

Convenience store, out of luck.

Last night, I went outside after hearing some commotion. A traffic jam happened RIGHT IN FRONT of my house. I went outside to speak to someone trying to get traffic going again.

He spoke to me, saying, "This group of kids just made a remote-control car go into the road. It was doing doughnuts as far as I could tell."

A group of kids? This, for some reason, sounded suspicious to me.

\* \* \*

I looked at the calendar this morning, only to see that today was THAT day...

My clothes felt tighter than normal. My scale was broken, so I couldn't tell what my weight was. I didn't even bother to get coffee because the last few days, it was so awful.

I didn't bother to try and go to work because they might as well kick me out again. I would have gone for food if it weren't for the grocery closing on me the last few days. I would have gone to the convenience store for just one bite of food purchased, but it was out of stock the last few days.

All that time, I felt an awful presence coming from the broken, rotting house on the end of the road.

\* \* \*

I decided to go to the old house on the end of the road to find out what was going on. I had heard that kids often hang out there for things with kids. I had brushed it off as merely things for kids and not for the adults to handle. But I felt something off. Like REALLY off.

The air was getting increasingly heavier, and heavier, and heavier. I would have used my car if it weren't for the fact that this morning, it wouldn't start. It was a long walk, maybe twenty minutes at best. I was getting increasingly slower with each step closer to the old house.

The neighbors, all this time, were looking at me with horror.

\* \* \*

I walked into the old house. There was a hallway from the entrance. I should have seen the signs. A white cat crossed my path on the way. A creak was in the floor as I walked in. The address had 666 in it, mixed with other numbers.

I pressed on despite my instinct screaming at me to get the fuck out of there. I explored further, hearing the children's voices get increasingly louder with each time I got closer.

There were sets of armor at the sides of the next hallway. When I got near one, it *moved*!

It actually moved. It took its sword and thrust it down.

I was glad to have avoided it. I pressed on, making sure not to go too close to the armors.

The voices didn't sound like they spoke English.

I pressed my ear to the door, and heard a conversation.

>"Hey, Weiss, about that company's CEO..."  
>  
>"Yeah, Lex, what about that icky man?"  
>  
>"Aren't you glad we cursed him, Kala?"  
>  
>"Shh! He could be here!"  
>  
>"You're right, Cam. But can't we get on with the ritual?"  
>  
>"Oh, all right. Let's do it."

I decided to peek through the door, to get a good look at what was going on. There was a glowing painted pentagram on the floor, surrounded with candles. There were seven kids total, all in bright clothing. I would have expected the goth look among the occult, but in bright clothes?

>"*Ostende ei quisnam sit!"*

That's what they all said, as if in a chant. They were chanting the same thing. As they were, I was getting so fat I had to take off my clothes. But behind the door for good measure. It was as if I was blowing up like a balloon.

After a good 30 times chanting, I reverted for some reason.

The kids then looked at me peeking through the door.

>"Jessie, what about the ritual?"  
>  
>"Lee-Park, let's just do what we need to. Hey, wait a..."  
>  
>"Oh no, the icky man's here! What do we do, Yolanda!"  
>  
>"Cam, you said he could be here, what'd you do?"  
>  
>"I did not summon him!"

They all walked up to me, looking at me like I had something on my face. Then, they went back to their pentagram and chanted again, but this time a different phrase.

>"*Ipse nocebit se!*"  
>  
>"*Ipse manu sua morietur!*"

I did not understand what they were chanting, but my hand was moving by itself and choking me. It took all my strength to just stop it and write this note. As they chant louder, my one hand squeezes my neck, and my other hand, free to write this on the paper. My life flashed before my eyes. And I am truly sorry...

*These were the words written on the suicide note left by XXXXXXX CEO Mark Pryor in the condemned house on XXXXXXX Ave. The parents of Weiss, Lex, Kala, Cam, Lee-Park, Yolanda, and Jessie did not confirm nor deny any of them being involved with the occult.*

Before I start this story I just want to thank you all for your support. I understand that some of you might have been concerned for my safety and therefore I'm obliged to tell you that I'm fine. Actually more than fine but I'll tell you more about that later. I also saw a comment that told me that I was

*"You didn’t know what to do with the package so you threw it away? Twice? Knowing what these people are like and how expensive everything seems to be, no one would do that. I’m sorry, that’s ridiculous and completely idiotic."*

Now I can't blame you. I understand why you're telling me that my choice to do so was Idiotic. It would have been if it weren't for the cops that had started to pop-up outside of my warehouse. This was what I meant with "Unwanted attention" and "Friendly visits". So when I get a package with no address and when I ask people around about it and get no answer I just assume that it's there to expose me, kill me or hurt me. Now that I've explained that let's get into today's story.

I've fucked up...Not your regular old "Oopsies I came late to work" kind of fuck up. Rather a "Oopsie I'll probably get tortured until I die in front of people on the dark-web" kind of fuck up. Before I tell you about my fuck up let me warn you. Never make a deal that fuck someone over. Not sure if you understood me but NEVER make a deal that fuck someone over...especially if it's on the dark-web. Yet again I don't recommend you being on the dark-web. Sure it might be boring but boring and alive is much better than excited and dead. Don't make my mistake, No amount of money is worth dying for... Or that was a lie, everyone has a price... This was mine.

So It's been a little hectic since my last post... Everything has gone downhill since then but let me start with the beginning of everything.

It's the morning after I got that fucking package, I haven't been able to sleep tonight so I've decided to do this alright, It might not be the smartest fucking idea I've had in my entire life but I mean I had to screw over someone... So I decided to message Miranda. I made a deal with her first. She was the better paying of them over time. I know I'm greedy but hell if I'm risking my fat ass for something I'd rather do it for money then morale. Judge me as much as you want, I don't fucking care now. It's already been done. Off-track again, fuck. I need to write it down if not my story will never be heard.

Well I messaged Miranda:

"Hey Miranda, It's Paul, We need to fucking talk. right now, call me when you can"

And God as my witness she answered in what felt like seconds.

"Shit alright, I'm in the area I'll meet you. Come to the place you drop off the packages for me. 1 hour, don't be late"

And there was nothing more to it. Before I left I packed up my laptop, burner phones and made some sandwiches. I wasn't planning on actually coming back. Before I left i took out the .45 ACP I had under the desk in case of some hooligans trying to get to me. After quickly packing down the gun I took the small box that I had received from Miranda and went on my way to the location given to me. Upon arrival I saw a gathering of cars outside the old warehouse and as I proceeded to park my car beside one of the vehicles standing there I picked up my gun and tugged it down the back of my pants.

I walked in to be greeted by Miranda:

"Hey Paul! Thanks for meeting up, do you have the package?" She said with a cheery voice.

"Yeah I do, what is in this damn thing that made Jack willing to pay a fortune to get it?" I asked in a serious tone.

"Well, Since you didn't fuck me over" She said as she gestured to give her the box.

I hesitated for a second before I slowly handed her the package.

"Thank you" She said while inspecting the box for damage.

She opened the box and took out a small glass box with metal corners. Inside of the glass box was a small purple/black ball that looked to be pulsating.

"This" she said while shaking the little box

"This is the first confirmed black matter piece created by humans"

I just stood with a confused face.

"You're kidding right?" I said with a small chuckle.

Her face went all serious in an instant almost like I had offended her just by asking.

"Yes, of course I'm serious!" she said in an annoyed tone.

"How? why? why me?" I said, confused.

"Well" She said while putting the glass box down.

"I've never had an issue with you or your deliveries the past year so I didn't think it would be now" She sounded genuine.

I just nodded and said:

"What should we do about jack? If we do nothing I'll be dead" I said seriously, almost threatening.

Miranda just looked at me with a straight face not breaking an inch. We probably stood there for a solid minute or so before she finally spoke.

"I think it's time to change the management at Jack's organization," she said with a half smile.

She nodded to one of the guards that were there to come over. She continued to whisper something in his ear before looking back at me.

"I need your help, I need you to lure Jack out, do you know what to do with that box you told me about?"

"Not sure" I said, thinking what to do next.

"I suppose I'll message Jack and ask" I continued.

She nodded and I started to write to Jack.

"Hey man, So I got what I promised you, what do you want me to do with it?" I typed out before clicking send.

It didn't take longer than a few seconds before I got a message back.

"Perfect, let's meet at the gas station" He wrote back to me.

"He wants to meet up" I said to Miranda.

She thought about it for a while before speaking.

"Then so be it" She said before using me along to another room."

She pulled out an empty glass box exactly like the other one before dropping down a marble on the small stand that the glass box contained.

"This should do it" She said with a smirk and handed me the box

"Give him this" She said, not stopping to smirk.

Now I thought this was fucking crazy but what choice did I have, I had already played my hand with Miranda. So I went to the gas station. Before I even pulled up to the gas station I got a strange feeling in my gut. It's hard to explain, It was almost like a primal instinct kicked in that told me to get away from there as fast as I could bear. Now since I must be fucking stupid I didn't listen to my gut, I continued to pull up to the gas station. I walked up to the cashier but before I even could open my mouth something hit me in the back of the head.

"Fuck man why did you hit him so fucking hard, the boss told us to keep him alive" I heard a deep voice say.

"Shut the fuck up Roger, you do it next time if it's so fucking easy ey?" The other man said with a harsh tone

"He's starting to wake up" said Roger.

I tried to move but my hands and legs were tied up so I just kind of wobbled on the concrete floor like a fish on land or a snake stuck on ice. They continued to drag me and I must have hit my head again cause I passed out just to wake up in what looked like a basement. I was still tied up of course and I could hear people talking outside.

"The boss will come any second" a male voice said.

"Yeah this show is going to be fantastic" said another guy outside the door.

Both people started laughing until I heard what sounded like gun fire outside.

"Hey what was that?" Said the first guy.

"I don't know man, I'll go check it out" the second guy said.

Not long after I heard two heavy thuds. Something I can just assume was the two guards falling to the floor.

The basement door slowly crept open as a dark figure stood at the doorway with a silenced gun in its hand. Now I was scared, scared for my life I thought it was me this guy was after. So I started crawling the best I could the other way from this figure. Now I've been hit pretty damn hard in my head so my vision was a bit faded I mean shit it still is. I was more scared then I have ever been when he came down those stairs. It felt like hours as he took one step...

"Why the fuck did I get myself into this shit"

two steps...

"Man I regret it, I regret it all"

three steps...

"LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!" I yelled at the figure walking towards me.

"I'm not here to hurt you" The figure said in a deep voice. Probably the deepest I've ever heard.

"We did promise you safety" The figure said.

what the fuck does this person mean? safety who promised me fucking safety???

"The boss wants to talk to you" the figure said.

I was easily picked up by the figure, I tried to get away as much as I could but it got me in a strong grip. I was put in the back of a van and we drove for I don't even know how long, I fell back and forth out of consciousness on the trip but we finally arrived.

I blinked frantically trying to adjust to the light outside the van.

"You alright man?" A female voice said.

"Miranda?" I said confused

"Hey guys can you cut those things off, let him move Jesus" I heard the female voice say to what I assumed was the figure from before.

"Yes of course Ma'am" the figure said.

He proceeded to cut the rope around my hands and legs and I could feel my muscles loosen it's tension.

"Thank you" I mumbled harshly

The female that I now could see clearer was Miranda. I couldn't believe it, I was going to live.

"It's over'' Miranda said. Jack won't be a problem for none of us anymore. Thank you, I owe you" She said with a soft smile.

"Now that all that is over I got a proposition for you" She said with a grin.

So I have to stop here and tell you something that has a lot of value to what I'm about to tell you. So you guys don't know yet what I studied. If this was yesterday. I'd prefer not to say but as you know it's not yesterday. Anyway, I studied molecular physics at a prestigious university in northern Sweden (Yes Also a thing that you guys didn't know about me yet). I also studied Astrophysics in my spare time, so yes you could say that I'm fairly smart. Now that that's over I'll get back to the story.

Miranda ushered me forward into this cabin at a lake side. We walked into a large dinner table that was too big for the room. She looked at me with that serious face she had when we talked business.

"I'd like to offer you a position at a project that's going to change the future. I could need your expertise in a...let's call it a project of mine" she said with that same smirk as before.

I thought about it for a second cause I don't want to be dragged into some crazy shit as I just got dragged into it but I had to ask.

"What...Project?"

I asked with a serious face, not really convinced on the whole "project" idea yet. She looked around for a bit and nodded to the guards to leave the room. It must have been minutes before she finally decided to speak.

"Time travel" she said, looking at me like it was something that she had been holding in forever.

"I understand how it sounds, but I'm not joking. that little piece of dark matter will change the world" she said and glared of into the distance like she was dreaming herself away.

"Money won't be a problem, me and my organization got enough to last you a million life times." she continued not leaving her gaze.

"What's the catch?" I said jokingly while giving her a little smile.

"You're going to have to leave everything behind and never look back" She said, not looking at me with a slightly sad expression.

We sat quiet for a while before I finally told her.

"Where do I sign up?"

So, tell me that this isn't something you'd say yes to also. Sure you're going to basically "Stop existing" publicly and all your family will think you've died. But, sometimes life is too short to pass upon opportunities that present itself in the worst times possible. My dad always told me to do the things I thought were impossible and this certainly was considered impossible.

So I'll be in touch if I discover the universe's final secret until then.

Sincerely yours,

Paul

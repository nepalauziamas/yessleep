Do you know the smell of your own brain leaking from your nose? Or ‘brain rot’ as some people call it.

It kind of smells like… burned wood mixed with tangerines.

Rancid.

The stink of a mould forming on your brain, too late to stop.

Have you heard of “The White Mouse”? It’s a kid’s show. The white mouse was the one who taught me about brain mould.

I don’t expect you to remember the show—It was taken off air a long time ago, and every trace has been wiped cleanly away. Still though, the internet is a big place. I’m sure it’s still alive somewhere.

I think it used to air on PBS kids, but I could be wrong. It’s hard to find information when the whole show has been deleted off of the face of the planet. 

There will always be remnants of something, even if it’s been intentionally shoved into irrelevancy following controversy. I am those lost remnants. All I have is my own knowledge, blurry and not quite clear, but still at the back of my mind. I want to tell you about my involvement in this show because it’s come back to haunt me, and I don’t know what to do. Right now, you’re the only outlet I’ve got. I’ve heard of people sharing their experiences they’ve had on old kid’s TV shows, so I want to tell you mine.

Anyway, I guess I’ll start from the beginning.

At six years old, I didn’t want to be on TV. 

Sure, I liked the idea of being on TV. It was like fantasy to me, stepping into the so-called TV world where all my favourite characters were. Acting, though, wasn’t really appealing to me. Like every other kid, I preferred to stay in my own world, enveloped in my own imagination, sitting in front of the TV on Saturday mornings and watching Power Rangers.  I lived in my own little bubble as a kid, but I did listen to what was going on around me. 

Mom’s dream was for me to be on the TV screen—and our local TV studio—one of which has become known over the years-- were offering parents cash for their kid’s participation in a new show. It’s not like we were strapped for money, but I guess mom really wanted me to be on TV. 

Dad hated the idea, so he left. I don’t think he left because of her insistence on me becoming a child actor, I just don’t think he was happy. He did sent me a good luck card though. Mom threw it in the trash, but I managed to pull it out and hide it under my mattress. I remember I had two auditions. 

One was in a large room in front of three important looking people in suits, where I was asked to recite lines off of a crumpled piece of paper, and the other was a group audition I did with a bunch of other kids. To my six-year-old self, it was just extra playtime. We all sat in a circle and sang songs with a giant stuffed mouse. At first, I remember being terrified of the thing when it first appeared. I never liked people in costumes. They made my stomach hurt. Just the thought of a person being inside the suit suffocated with inside a giant head scared me. I was scared.

I remember physically stumbling away from the thing. But when different coloured screen’s around the studio began to flash different colours, the dread coiling inside my gut melted away and I had the sudden overwhelming urge to give it a big hug.

The white mouse was looking for friends. That’s what we were told. And he would pick out his favourites.

So, with my fear fading, and the dancing lights in my eyes making me feel giddy like I’d eaten a handful of candy, I decided I was going to give the white mouse a big hug. Hugs were his favourite, after all. And candy. He was custom to jolly ranchers.

I headed over, taking long strides towards where he was sitting, greeting everyone, but that uneasy feeling pricked again, and I backed away once more. I wasn’t the only one with mixed feeling about the star of the show. A little girl with pigtails couldn’t talk to him without bursting into tears, so she was quietly pulled away, as well as others who were either too quiet or shy, refusing to even look at him.

It was the loud ones who were left. The boy in front of me who kept shouting, “Tell us a story!” with the widest grin on his face—and a girl who insisted on sitting on the white mouse’s lap. After a while of kids being dragged on and off camera, a status quo started to form, and pieces of paper were brought out for parents to sign, as well as popsicles given to us as a reward. 

A woman with a bright smile appeared on a screen and told us that we were the remaining seven and would have permanent positions as the white mouse’s friends on the show. Something about that thrilled me. I’d made so many friends that day, and we were all going to be on TV. 

I couldn’t sleep the night before our first recording. I ate my pancakes too fast and felt nauseous the whole car-ride to the studio, but when I was led onto the main stage and saw all of the other kids already sitting in a circle, I swallowed my nervousness and pasted on a huge smile like everyone told me to. Mom, as well as the other parents, were allowed behind the camera’s for the first few recording’s.

I waved to her when the cameras were off and pulled faces at her when she told me to smile wider. I was smiling though.

I remember scowling back at her on purpose. If I smiled any more, I’d rip a hole through my mouth. 

Still though, I was reminded of my promise to be extra smiley when a man tapped me on the shoulder and pretended to stretch his lips across his face. 

The boy next to me thought it was funny, labelling the man “fish face” in following recordings, and even incorporating it into the show itself, with The White Mouse focusing one whole episode on how the ocean worked, and its sea-life. After a while, though, mom stopped coming into the studio, along with the rest of the parents. I asked her why when she came to pick me up, and she just tossed me a smile. “Adult stuff.” She told me. Later on that night, though, I heard her talking on the phone about paperwork she didn’t feel comfortable signing. I was a master at listening to her phone conversations, so, hiding behind the door, I managed to get the gist of it. 

The studio were worried about the show being leaked to the public before being broadcast, so she had to sign an NDA. However, after doing so, the studio still wouldn’t let her near the studio during recordings. Mom wasn’t happy.

She made that clear. But I was enjoying the show, so she didn’t say anything more. She would drop me off after kindergarten, with a juice carton and a script I’d been told to learn overnight, before promising to come and pick me up in three hours, before driving away. I could tell she was fuming at the thought of leaving me all alone, and I caught her glare at the guard standing in front of the gates when she signed me in. I was a kid, though, so things like that didn’t really bother me. 

Once I said goodbye to mom, the guard led me inside the studio, a large glass building, and through automatic doors onto the main recording stage. Something was different, and I noticed the difference automatically.

Not the absence of the parents behind the cameras—though that was still kind of jarring. No, it was the room. I was used to a simple stage with beanbags for us all to sit on, and a big red chair for the white mouse. When I stepped onto the stage, however, automatically slumping into my bean-bag of choice next to all my new friends, I realised the room was a lot darker.

Maybe it was just the fact that mom wasn’t there.

That’s what I thought, at least.

Then, though, it hit me that it wasn’t just that our parents weren’t there. Something was wrong. Something had--shifted.

I could sense it like spoiled milk in the air, tightening my grip around my empty juice carton.

“Issac?” One of the staff came over with their usual smile, holding a clipboard. When mom was there, I was allowed to walk on my own, and was directed with hand gestures. Now that she wasn’t, staff grabbed me roughly and pulled me on stage.

I couldn’t really explain it. Everything else seemed normal. The same people greeted me, colouring my face if I was too pale, or swapping my t-s-shirt for a colourful one. It was my surroundings. What had been a pretty landscape with hills and a shining sun had been replaced with nothing. 

The walls were black. I looked for stars, or a moon, just like in other episodes when we explored the universe and planets, but I was just staring at my own reflection. Once the episode began, I remember the stage became so bright it hurt my eyes. I tried to cover them, tried to bury my head between my knees, but I was just told to smile and join in with the theme song. I was handed something, and at first I couldn’t tell what it was it my hands.

Everything was so bright, and I wanted to go home. Squinting, I figured out what they were. Mouse ears. Just a flimsy, plastic headband with felt mouse ears attached. The rest of the kids placed them on their heads. So, after hesitating, I did too.

I could fell the white mouse’s eyes watching me, waiting for me to wear it.

I don’t remember much about that day. At least, I only remember pieces of it. Only the bits before I wore my mouse ears properly. I remember that we talked a lot about the human body—and the white mouse explained to us, and the cameras, that human beings are easy to cut through. 

Obviously, I didn’t like what he was talking about. Like any other sane kid, I’d walked onto the stage expecting singing lessons and stories about different cultures. I tried to leave. 

I shook the others next to me, careful not to get the white mouse, or the crew’s attention—but the other kids were enjoying what was being shown.

I saw their eyes looking right through me, glassy and vacant and not all there, enveloped in the white mouse’s new stories, with images which made me my tummy twist. The human skull, and then torso, followed by a detailed illustration of where to inflict the most pain on the human body. I didn’t want to know how to accurately sever breathing or cut through flesh. I wanted to fucking go home. 

I remember pulling off my mouse ears, especially when the white mouse started telling us which organs were his favourite, a scary picture of brain appearing—I was done. I was done smiling and acting like everything was okay, when even the staff seemed mesmerised, hypnotised by his words. I tried to run off stage. But Fish Face caught me, dragging me back to my beanbag. The recording was halted, the lights flickering on, and he knelt in front of me with a permanent fishy smile which made me feel worse. It didn’t help that everyone had the same expression. The kids, the adults, whether they were producers or staff, or just getting coffee. 

Empty. That was all I could think. Their eyes, everything about them, was hollow and glassy. Fish Lips fixed my headband tighter over my head. He kept pressing, harder, and harder until I had to grit my teeth through a cry. He cocked his head to the side.  “I don’t think you’re wearing them correctly, young man.”

The theme started, and I hated that the words were on my lips already.

When we're sullen and down

The White Mouse will come to town!

Make us laugh and smile and shake with glee

The white mouse is our family!

“I don’t want to wear them.” I whispered when the song had stopped, half aware of the show going on around me.

One of the kids was asking the white mouse a question, and he responded with, “Rip out the intestines first, young man!”

“Well, how are you going to be his friend?” Fish Lips asked. “Issac, look! All your friends are wearing them! If you want to be the white mouse’s friend, you have to become a mouse yourself.” He chuckled, shoving my hands out of the way, where I was trying to shield my head from the headband. At some point, I lost to his brute strength, and he was easily able to properly fix it onto my head. 

Now, that’s where things go a little blurry—or I guess very fucking blurry. I guess I went to sleep for a bit.

That’s what it felt like.

Like I was napping—but awake the whole time.

I was aware of small things. I knew where I was, and what I was doing. And the lights surrounding us. It was the weirdest feeling. 

Even now, when I can recall pieces of what was blanked out, I can still remember the sensation. Like floating, flying up, up, up and dancing on clouds made of cotton candy. I guess it was the kid equivalent of being high. In that state, I realised I  couldn’t do the things I wanted to do. Like run. Like leap off stage and jump into my mom’s arms because the white mouse was scaring me. But the lights took away those thoughts, drowning them deep, deep into the back of my mind. 

The lights chipped away at my brain, twisting me into a smiling puppet. 

Instead of crying, I smiled, despite tears filling my eyes and my chest feeling like it was about to burst—my stomach creeping into my throat. I laughed, and held hands with the others, bouncing around in a circle while a woman was brought onto the stage—and the white mouse demonstrated how to perform an operation. The lights stopped me from running. Stopped me from screaming, and falling to my knees, sobbing into the carpet on the stage and calling for my mom. 

The lights took everything away. They flashed different colours throughout the recording.

 Green meant my thoughts and feelings would be taken away, orange made me laugh until I was crying at things that weren’t  even funny, and yellow played with my mouth, teasing  words entangled on my tongue that were never mine.

Red was my favourite. When the lights flashed red, that suffocating feeling leeching onto my mind let go, and I found myself walking out of the automatic doors into sunlight, and my mom’s awaiting arms. The whole episode had gone by in the blink of an eye, and I was left feeling tired and drained, all the scary things I’d seen melting away. Just like a dream, the horrors of each recording would bleed away into nothing once the pressure of the mouse headband was off of my head, and a vivid blur of green, orange, red, and yellow weren’t flashing in my eyes.

I couldn’t tell mom what was happening because I couldn’t remember anything past arriving at studio and slumping into my beanbag. It was only months later when mom started to notice something was wrong. I started having nosebleeds regularly which wasn’t normal.

It was never when I was in the studio, always when I was at home. I would be sitting in front of the TV watching all my favourite shows, and I’d feet something dripping from my chin, and then spattering on mom’s cream carpet. Initially, the bleeds were normal. Mom would grab some tissue paper and sit me down, pressing them to my nose and mouth, while I continued watching TV. 

Then, though, it wasn’t just bleeds. I started forgetting things. I’d be in my room playing with my action figures, and then I’d be halfway down the stairs, one of my mom’s paper-weight’s in my hand, like I knew what to do with it. It didn’t feel like I’d moved from my room—like my body had moved for me.  The nosebleeds started to get thicker, letting off a stink that turned my mother as white as the tissue paper she was trying to staunch the bleed with. The smell was like burning mixed with tangerines.

Tangy. That’s all I can use to describe the smell.

It was when I sneezed up something pink and stringy onto the kitchen table, when mom rang a doctor. I thought it was funny and tried to poke at it. It was—bouncy. Like jelly. After wiping down the kitchen table, cleaning my face, and giving me a popsicle, mom spent hours on the phone saying words I didn’t understand, and all the while my nose continued to run deep, dark red onto my t-shirt before changing to an odd variety of pink and grey. 

The day after, I was taken for multiple scans while mom told me everything was fine, and that I was just ‘a little bit sick’. Per my contract, however, I still had to record for The White Mouse. The second I put on my headband, I re-entered that all too familiar frightening world of no longer being in control of my own body. 

Before… light. 

It was light in the form of my mother’s voice, her hands grasping hold of my face and the twisted look of horror through my flickering lashes, before she ripped off my headband and yanked me to unsteady feet. I blinked, and the white mouse’s high pitched voice was no longer bleeding into my brain. I could—think again.  I could move my arms and legs.

All around me, clarity was taking over. The other kids sitting on their beanbags staring blankly, and the white mouse, who was being ushered off stage. Various staff crowded around my mother, but she was inconsolable, screaming, waving something above her head. As a kid, I shouldn’t have known what they were, but the white mouse told us a few weeks easier all about brain scans. 

That’s what mom was holding up; copies of my brain in static black and white, while grabbing a woman with one hand, shaking her violently. 

When producers yelled at her to leave, she grabbed other kids gently, pulling off their headbands, her eyes widening when they insisted she put them back on. The boy next to me, who had been my friend the whole time, yanked his headband off my mom and placed it back on his head, a wide smile splitting his face open. 

“Brain rot.” Mom kept saying, then louder, pointing at me. “What have you done to him? What are you doing to these children?”

“Miss Koji, please calm down.” A man with glasses and a scowl situated himself in front of her. “We’re going to have to ask you to leave the premises.” His eyes flashed to me. “Please leave Issac. As a valuable member of our family, we need him.”

“Family? I’m his mother!”

“We are too, Miss. Issac is a very important part of the show. Without him, we wouldn’t have a seventh friend.”

Mom laughed. She actually laughed, which made me nervously giggle too.

The man, however, wasn’t laughing.

“Miss Koji—”

She cut him off. “This is child abuse.” Mom said. “What the fuck are you doing to them? It’s brain rot!”

“It’s just part of the show, Miss Koji.”

“Really?” She nodded her head, her eyes glistening with tears. “You’ve rotted my son’s brain. The doctor’s don’t even know how to explain it!” Her cries grew more and more strangled, and I grasped for her hand. “You’re done.” She said. “I’m calling the cops, and I’m getting you shut down. Investigated.” Mom didn’t stop until she was nose to nose with the man. 

“I’m taking my son and the other children.” Taking fast strides over to the other kids, mom picked up a redhead, who didn’t move, she was like a doll in my mother’s arms, her eyes glassy and hollow.

She was still staring at the spot where the white mouse had sat. All of them were. Following in my mom’s footsteps, I tried to get my friend’s attention, but he just swayed to the left and then the right. When I knelt in front of him and shook him, I caught something red glistening at the end of his nostril.

“Put the kid down, Miss Koji.” The man said stiffly. “Starting from today, these children are property of The White Mouse. If you would like to see the paperwork, including parental permission, please follow me to my office and stop scaring the kids.”

To my surprise, mom did actually put the girl down. “Excuse me?”

“I explained it very clearly, you should be able to understand.” He said. “All seven of the white mouse’s friends will remain here for the foreseeable future.” He nodded at me. “Including Issac. You signed it during the first few weeks and test runs.” His lips curved into a smile. “Also, might I add,” The man spoke with smug triumph. “We have paid you quite the sum.”

“Take it back.” Mom said. “I’m taking my son.”

“I’m afraid that is not possible, Miss Koji. Per the contract—”

“I don’t care!”

Mom knocked a light over—and then a wooden tree. The next thing I knew I was being dragged from the premises. 

Part of expected them to come after us, but they didn’t, only frowning at my mother in disapproval. Mom spent the car-ride home on her phone, calling parents—all of which weren’t answering to her frustration. 

When she slammed her hands into the steering wheel, I buried my head in my knees. My head was hurting. I just wanted mom to stop crying. Pressing my hands over my ears, I thought about the latest episode of Power Rangers. I thought about how awesome the fights were, and the explosions. By the time I was smiling to myself, and the throbbing in the back of my skull had stopped, I peeled my hands from my ears, hearing mom on the phone. 

“Hello, 911? Yes, this is Maki Koji. I’m ringing about an incident which just—”

Bang.

It’s crazy how your life can be turned upside down—quite literally—just like that.

I don’t want to describe the crash. I barely remember any of it, anyway. It just sounded like the roar of a dragon, and then it attacking us, lifting us into the air and dropping us onto the ground. That’s what it was in my kid brain at least. 

In reality, though, it was the sound of a head-on collision with a truck. The world spun and spun and spun until I hit something, and I was forced from that almost-darkness trying to envelope me. 

Concrete. I was lying on my back, staring at a bright blue sky, and thinking about the ice-cream mom had promised when she’d strapped me into the car minutes earlier. I was only aware of two things when rough hands dragged me from the wreck. 

My mother was dead, her decapitated body halfway down the road in a smear of bright red gore on steaming tarmac.  I knew exactly how her head had been removed, which tendons had been severed, and that her body, twisted like a pretzel in the middle of the road, was the perfect meal for the white mouse.

He liked his liver chopped into pieces.

The  heart’s drained of blood so he could savour the fleshy pieces.

Brain. Always the frontal lobe. The stem was one his favourites too.

That’s what I was thinking when the paramedic told me with solemn eyes that I wouldn’t be going back to my mom’s house.

After mom’s death, I ended up in a group home for around two weeks until I was adopted. Apparently kids who just lost their parents in horrifying accidents were more likely to be chosen. My adoptive parents were amazing, welcoming me into their home and treating me like the son they’d never had. They insisted I had therapy for the first few years, but I’d blanked everything out. I didn’t want to think about my mom, or what had happened to her.

I wanted to play in my room and make friends at my new school. I just wanted to be a kid. As I grew up, progressing into teenagehood, I turned the white mouse from a real experience into a stupid nightmare I’d dreamed up as a kid.

I became convinced it was just trauma from what happened to mom. I never thought about the stupid kid’s show until a few days ago. I didn’t want to. Because when it randomly came into my mind, questions followed, a hurricane of them battering my skull. It fucking hurt.

The logical part of me knew I couldn’t run away from it forever.  But I could sure as hell try. 

Four months out of high school, and I still didn’t know what I was doing with my life. I’d just been rejected from the school I’d planned to go with my girlfriend, Millie, right across the country. My escape. 

Well, it was going to be. The letter rejected me with no coherent reason except “certain circumstances” which didn’t make any sense. Millie would understand, I knew she would. I just didn’t know how to tell her.

Fuck. We’d been planning it since sophomore year. It was our stupid dream to get out of town.

And in my case, away from my past.

I figured taking her to the fanciest restaurant in town was the best way of letting her down gently.

Millie had been staring at her plate of pasta for way longer than necessary, her lips curved into their usual pout.

I normally found it adorable, but that night it was pissing me off. She hadn’t said a word all night.

After going through every app on my phone, even the settings app, I stopped stalling and took a deep breath.

“Millie.” I said, “Uh—”

“You didn’t get in.” Millie said before slapping my rejection letter down.

Leaning back in my chair, I frowned at the letter. I had half a mind to pretend I had no idea what it was.

“Yeah.” I finally managed to breathe. “I’m sorry.”

“Sorry?” Millie grabbed my hands like she always did, her stormy expression melting away. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

“I was about to.” I said. “I was just…”

“Just…?”

“Scared.” I admitted, “We made a pact, remember?”

“Well, yeah.” Millie squeezed my hands tighter, “But screw that pact. I’m going wherever you’re going.”

I couldn’t resist a smile. That night, I promised myself I wouldn’t get angry at her for saying that. I knew what her dream was, and she was going to follow it. And if it was without me, then do be it. But at that moment, I told myself I’d just play along.

“Community college?” I smirked a little.

“Yes! They have the exact same major I want to do.”

“And a 0.0% success rate.”

“Hey.” She pulled a face. “I don’t care. If you want, we can get jobs and save up for our own place and apply next year.”

“Millie.” I sighed. “You’ve been talking about HYU for years—"

The words choked in my mouth when I heard a familiar tune bleeding into my ears like it had always been there. I thought I was hearing things, but twisting around in my chair, it got louder. I could feel my meal crawling its way back up my throat. 

I could hear it in perfect clarity until it was everywhere, a leech crawling inside my head. I could heat the exact pitch of the theme, the way it played with my head, twisting my thoughts and sending me into a familiar daze where I couldn’t think straight. I felt my fingers twitch in my lap, itching to grasp hold of the knife on my plate. Then the spoon, and the fork, and looking at Millie, I knew exactly how to scoop her eyes from its socket. 

I knew how to slice her throat perfectly to avoid blood spill. While one hand twitched to grab the knife, the other was running through my hair on its own, grasping a fistful and yanking. The song was on my tongue, entangled in my throat, each lyric suffocated by scream clenched between my teeth.

“When we're sullen and down

The White Mouse will come to town!

Make us laugh and smile and shake with glee

The white mouse is our family!”

“Issac?”

Millie’s voice was faded, ocean spray, when I picked up the knife, running my fingers across the blunt blade. It wasn’t sharp enough to cause real damage. However, the spoon would be the best tool to remove the eye from its socket. 

Judging from the size of her socket, and the size of the spoon, it looked like an easy job. My brain was working on overdrive, my gaze finding random objects. Table-cloth. Strangling tool. Also, a material to mop up blood and entrails. Vase. Can be used to cause trauma to the skull and brain. My grip was tightening around the knife, my thoughts blurring. 

Every person in the room was a possible target, and Millie seemed so easy. She was unarmed, completely oblivious, and her flesh easy to cut through.

What did the white mouse say again?

His voice was suddenly in my head, far more hysterical than I remembered. “Just like cutting through cheese!”

“Issac!”

It was the second time she said my name when the song—stopped. Everything stopped, and I found myself trembling, sweat pouring down my face, and a sudden, irresistible urge to reach into my own skull and tear out my brain, and crushing it between my fists. 

The world stopped spinning, and I dropped the knife back onto my plate, the metallic clang making me jump. Millie was leaning over the table, her face inches from mine. “What happened? Hey, you zoned out for a minute.”

Pressing the back of her hand against my forehead, she hissed out. “You’re sweating! Hey, Issac, are you okay?”

I just nodded, scanning the restaurant. “Yeah.” I croaked. Millie was right, I was sweating like crazy. Catching my reflection in my glass, I looked sick. Really fucking sick. I was pale, my eyes half lidded. I felt drained of energy. “I just feel kinda tired.”

“Tired?” She raised a brow. “Issac, you look sick. Like, super sick.”

“Probably ate something,” I managed to get out.

Millie jumped up. “I’ll get you some water,” she said hurriedly. “And I’ll wet some tissue paper to cool you down.”

“I said I’m fine—"

She was gone before I could finish my sentence. I’m not sure how long I sat waiting for her. It felt like time wasn’t even moving—like every second lingered just that little bit longer. All the  while, I was frowning at the knife on my plate and trying to understand where those feelings had come from, and the course of that song. It was real, playing out loud, and yet nobody reacted. It was when I started to notice disappearing customers when I came out of my daze. I think I just and stared at my plate. 

God, my head fucking pounded, and there was a pressure in my nose. Around me, patrons had been reduced to shadows and silhouettes caught in a mute vacuum. 

When the shadows started to move around, dancing across the room and I got a face-full of cool air grazing my skin, my eyes found the clock on the wall. It was almost 11pm. Millie and I had arrived at the restaurant at eight, and we’d barely gotten through our food before the college conversation came up.

Something ice cold slipped down my spine, and I lifted my head, scanning the room. It was almost empty, bar a couple talking behind me. I stood up, automatically losing my footing. 

Millie had been gone for almost two hours, and I’d been so out of it, it didn’t even register until I forced my brain into gear. Now that I was fully aware of what was going on, I forced my legs to work, finding the girl’s bathroom in the reception area. She couldn’t still be in there. That’s what I thought. Millie must have left, or maybe something came up—a family problem probably. Still though, I found myself knocking four times on the door.

“Hey.” I said, “Anyone in there?”

No answer.

No harm in peering inside, I thought.

Pushing the swinging door open, I stepped in. the first thing I saw was vast marble countertop and fancy faucets with hand sanitiser sensors next to each tap. 

The room was lit up in fluorescent light, and for a moment I was blinded, automatically reaching up to shade my eyes. When my vision cleared, I glimpsed something… moving on the floor. Twitching. Jolting. I saw it like an amalgamation of flesh at first, but looking closer, I realised I was looking at several moving bodies looming over something.

I didn’t see faces. Just fancy clothes and hairstyles. All my age, boy’s wearing white shirts and ties, and girl’s wearing formal dresses. But something was… wrong. 

There wasn’t supposed to be so much red. It wasn’t supposed to be covering them, their twitching hands slick deep, dark scarlet. Through their human barrier, I caught flashes of skin—the colour of Millie’s dress. They weren’t eating her, I thought hysterically. No, they were… nibbling. Slowly. Their teeth pierced her flesh, but they were taking their time, giggling. Red pooled around them, spilling across rich marble flooring. It was when I caught sight of something glistening, intense wriggling, glistening gore shining under the bathroom lights, when I remembered how to move. 

And like they had sensed that movement, they lifted their heads in sync, empty eyes finding mine. I recognised those eyes. I recognised what was on their heads too. The sound they were making was inhuman, chattering teeth. Before I could cry out, a yell choking the back of my throat, the door opened, and a hand grasped me by the scruff of my neck—dragging me out of the bathroom. “Oh, man.” A voice laughed, and I found myself being dragged back through the reception area and into the restaurant. The stranger dumped me back at my table before taking Millie’s seat.  

“You weren’t supposed to see until we made the finishing touches.”

The boy was my age, just like the others in the bathroom. He was tall, dark brown hair sticking up everywhere like he’d just gotten out of the shower, the white mouse headband sitting wonkily on his head. Looking at it years later, the thing looked like a kid’s art project, and yet it held so much power over its wearer. Unlike the others, his clothes were far more casual—jeans and a band t-shirt, a sherpa jacket complimenting them.

 At first glance, the boy looked like a seventeen year old kid, a recent graduate.  But looking closer, his eyes held no life in them. They were as empty as they were when I’d left him. His whole expression was blank, like I was looking at a second grader in a teenager’s body. Regarding me with a too-wide smile, his eyes penetrated right through me. Just like all those years ago when the white mouse took him. I never knew his name.

The boy was just “Friend 5” to me.

“Hey, can I get some service, please?” He called a waiter over, a petite woman with a polite smile.

There’s a body in the bathroom, I thought hysterically.

My girlfriend is dead in the bathroom.

The words were on my lips, but something was suffocating them in my throat, pulverising my plea into a sharp sob.

“Double chocolate fudge brownie milkshake.” He said, his gaze flashing to me. “Do you want anything? I’m buying.”

I couldn’t sit still in my chair. I was shaking. I could still see Millie’s body. I could still hear their chattering teeth ripping into her. I needed to get away—to run. But when I tried to move, my body was stiff, glued to the chair. When I didn’t say anything, he shrugged to the waitress and just ordered the milkshake.  “Long time no see, Issac!” He said excitedly, pointing to himself.

His mannerisms reminded me of a child. “Remember me? It’s Friend Five! We used to sit next to each other!”

When his milkshake came, the boy downed it, chocolate syrup running down his chin. “Come on, Issac! You remember!”

No.

I shook my head, but that just widened his smile. “Are you ready to come home? We’ve all missed you.”

“Home?” I managed to choke out.

“Yeah! We haven’t seen the white mouse in so long..” He pouted. “Without you, he refuses to talk to us.”

“What?”

“He refuses to talk to us.” The boy’s eyes darkened. “Without you, he’s so sad. He wants all of us together again.”

I don’t remember standing up. I don’t remember taking long strides towards the door, my stomach diving into my throat. When I reached the door, the theme started to play once more, blasting through the speakers and seeping into my brain like poison. My body had a visceral reaction to it, my head starting to throb with pressure. But I wasn’t the only one.

I glimpsed a waitress at the corner of my eye wiping down a table. 

She stopped suddenly, like her puppet strings had been cut, and started to laugh. Others joined her, a cacophony of hysterical laughter exploding around me until it was contagious, and I was feeling it too—hysterical bubbles climbing up my throat. When a woman choked up something fleshy and red through a string of laughter, I sobered up enough to make a run for it. Pulling open the door, I started to run, swallowing the laughter still wracking my chest. That theme was still in my head, the lyrics bleeding into me, forcing me to sing out loud. 

I was halfway across the street when blood spattered my hands and I smelled it again. Burned wood and tangerines dripping down my chin. 

Part of me expected to find my adoptive parents in the same state as Millie—but they worked late so I was greeted to an empty house; an empty house which had been broken into. They didn’t touch anything, only nibbling on the cheese in my refrigerator like some kind of bad fucking joke, leaving a note, and a surprisingly detailed map drawn in coloured crayon.

The map was simple, a drawing of my adoptive parents house, and a long squiggly line marking where X marked the spot.

To, Issac.

It's time to come home!

Remember:

When we're sullen and down

The White Mouse will come to town!

Make us laugh and smile and shake with glee

The white mouse is our family!

There was another arrow pointing to across the table where my eyes found a pair of mouse ears.

One of the felt ears was torn from when mom ripped it off my head.

"They're yours!”

A memory struck me, like it had been lying in wait to find me once again. The white mouse next to me, so close, his hysterical laughter, his plush paws sticky with red, holding mine, as he guided my hand clenched around the scalpel down a torso.

“It’s just cheese, Issac.” He told me—and I’d laughed too, nodding along.

“It’s so hard to cut through, white mouse!”

“Press harder. Here. Make a straight line.”

The following events which took place can be seen as stupid, but by then, even fully aware of the control the theme had over me, that it was still there inside my head, I couldn’t resist the urge. It was like something was coming alive inside of me, and that song had triggered it. 

I was shaking, blood slicking my hands and pooling down my face and chin, but my thoughts were blurry and confusing. 

The memory was still playing in my head, over and over again like a stuck record—and I was mumbling my six-year-old selves words.  I was smiling when I reached out and grabbed the mouse ears. I remember putting them on, forcing them onto my head and fixing them in place. Just like when I was a kid, my body was sent into autopilot. 

I was standing in my kitchen one minute, and then I was in the middle of nowhere under a twilight sky. My body wasn’t tired, even after peddling for God knows how long. It was an unfamiliar town. 

Unfamiliar wilderness. In front of me, several feet away, was what an abandoned barn surrounded by overgrown grass. Looking down at the map crumpled in my grasp, I was exactly where X marked the spot. They had even drawn trees and a box-like thing which looked like it was supposed to be the barn.

Logic took a while to kick in—and when it did, I was fully aware of what I was doing. I grabbed my back, and started to back away, when I saw movement ahead. An official looking guard stepped out of the barn before situating himself in front of it.

He was armed.

Heavily armed.

What was he guarding? It was just a rundown barn. I don’t think there’d been any life there in years.

I didn’t stay long enough to find out. I came back home, locked all the doors and windows, and I’m sitting here right now listening to them. I can hear them outside. They’ve gathered around my house, peeking through every window and door.

“When we're sullen and down

The White Mouse will come to town!

Make us laugh and smile and shake with glee

The white mouse is our family!”

It’s in my head, playing with my thoughts. It’s the third time I’ve caught myself holding my adoptive mom’s steak knife, but I don’t know what I’m supposed to do with it. My parents get home around midnight, so am I waiting for them? The white mouse called it Slice ‘N Stab. Slice the throat, and then stab through the heart. 

For maximum pain and suffering. The images are in my head. It’ll be so easy. 

So easy to kill my parents, and nobody will ever know because the white mouse told me how to hide a body. And better yet, how to sever limbs, liquidise them or burn them, and bury the remains where nature is beautiful. See, this is what I mean. These are the thoughts plaguing me, and I’m terrified of what he’s going to make me do.

Just like he did when I was six-years-old.

I called the police and sent them to the restaurant, but according to them, nothing is wrong. There’s no body in the girl’s bathroom. And that’s made me wonder if I’m crazy. If I’m hallucinating all this shit.

I keep looking up the show, but nothing is coming up. The White Mouse doesn’t exist, according to the internet. But every time I close my eyes, the song is there, seeping into me, like the white mouse himself is coming to snatch me. Maybe he is. Maybe he’s right outside my door waiting.

Waiting for me to come home.

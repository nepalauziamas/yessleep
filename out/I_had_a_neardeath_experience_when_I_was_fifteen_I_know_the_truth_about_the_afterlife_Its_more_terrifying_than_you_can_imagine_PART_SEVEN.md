The second the door opened, the stench of gasoline and burning flesh overwhelmed me, stinging my nostrils. A pile of blackened bodies lay scattered around the door, some still burning, most of them still moving slightly. The ones that were dead (well, *really* dead) had already liquified. Puddles of burning gasoline were everywhere. The air was thick with smoke.

"Go!" I shouted at Dante, who quickly shoved Jeff's wheelbarrow through the door. I paused for a split-second behind him so I could yell up the ladder and through the trapdoor in the ceiling: *"Hurry up, Aaron!"* Then I raced after them.

Dante wheeled Jeff down the back of the Walmart in the direction of the parking lot. Jeff was sitting up in the wheelbarrow with his handgun raised in front of him.

I glanced behind me and saw a group of Residents coming around the other end of the store and heading in our direction. "Hurry up!" I shouted to Dante.

"Movin as fast as I can!" he yelled back to me.

We reached the edge of the building and turned the corner. Most of the horde was still congregated in front of the store but there were still several dozen scattered across the far end of the parking lot.

Dante pushed Jeff ahead of him in a wild dash, dodging around the corpses, skirting the main parking lot, racing towards the highway. I was right behind Dante. I felt something grab me from behind. A corpse had ahold of me, clutching my backpack.

*"LIFE!"*

I tried to pull away, but its grip was too strong.

*"HATE LIFE!"*

I quickly slid out of the backpack's straps and left it behind.

Another corpse lunged at the wheelbarrow and Jeff fired his pistol, blasting it in the head.

The gunshot alerted the horde and instantly they turned as a whole, spotting us.

"LIFE! HATE LIFE, HATE LIVING!" they began screaming in unison, and charged in our direction. They were no more than a hundred yards away.

"Oh, shit!" I screamed, panicked.

The crowd surged towards us, closing the distance. There was no way we could outrun them.

I knew we were about to die.

Suddenly something arched through the air with a streak of flame. Glass shattered on the pavement and a fireball erupted between us and the horde, causing them to draw back fearfully.

I looked around and saw Aaron sprinting towards us, fumbling in his backpack for another Molotov cocktail. "Move your asses!" he screamed at us, turning with a Bic lighter in one hand and a Molotov in the other. He quickly lit it and hurled it at the horde. Another fireball splashed up, separating the mass of homicidal walking cadavers from us.

I felt a fleeting sense of relief to see Aaron had made it.

He caught up with us, panting. "That was my last one, hurry the fuck up, we gotta get out of here!"

We were about three quarters of the way to the front end of the parking lot, nearly home free. For a second I thought we were going to be okay.

Then I spotted the huge pothole in the pavement directly in front of Dante and Jeff. Dante, in a blind panic, was heading right for it.

"Look out!" I shouted, but it was too late.

Dante drove Jeff's wheelbarrow right into the pothole. The wheelbarrow overbalanced and turned over, spilling Jeff and the supplies piled around him onto the ground. He screamed as his injured ankle struck the asphalt.

"Oh Fuck!" Aaron shouted. Him and me ran to help.

"We gotta get him back in!" Dante screamed. He and Aaron began reaching down to grab Jeff.

"HATE LIFE! HATE LIVING! HATE LIFE! HATE LIVING!"

I spun around. My heart sank.

The flames were already dying down and the horde had resumed its relentless pursuit. The closest was only about thirty yards away. Some of them were in flames, but they pushed on, regardless.

"They're coming!" I shouted to the others. Dante and Aaron looked.

"We gotta go, now!" Dante said grimly.

"We can't leave Jeff!" Aaron screamed at him.

"No!" Jeff hissed through clenched teeth, a grimace of pain fixed on his face, "Dante's right! There isn't enough time! I've fucked! Leave me and save your own asses!"

"The fuck we will!" Aaron yelled at him.

Jeff pointed his pistol in Aaron's face. Aaron froze in shock. Jeff spoke in a very calm but intense voice. "I'm not asking, I'm telling. Leave me and go. Better one of us die than all four. Now *GO!!!"*

Aaron looked at me and Dante. There was a look of mournful resignation on his face. "Let's get the fuck out of here!"

"I'll try to hold them back!" Jeff said, raising his pistol to the fast-approaching horde.

The three of us ran across the remaining stretch of parking lot, back onto the street we had come in on. There weren't many Residents on the street. Behind us I heard Jeff firing his pistol repeatedly. Then he stopped shooting and began to scream.

I threw a final look back. I still wish I hadn't.

They had surrounded Jeff and were beginning to tear him apart. I saw Jeff, in final desperation, raise the pistol to his own temple. He pulled the trigger...*click!* The gun was empty.

We ran, Jeff's dying, agonized screams following after us until he fell silent.

\*\*\*\*\*

For a while after Jeff's death, everything was kind of a disordered blur. My memory of the immediate aftermath of our escape is hazy and jumbled from the terror and the shock of losing one of our number in such a brutal, horrific manner. I remember Dante stopping and turning to face the corpses, screaming and shouting incoherently and emptying his shotgun into the horde, racking the slide and pulling the trigger on an empty chamber, over and over, crying hysterically, until Aaron slapped him to bring him back to his senses.  I remember a Resident that was hardly more than a skeleton in the tattered remains of what looked to have once been the uniform of a Civil War Union soldier trying to ambush us from behind a parked car as we ran by it. Aaron simply clubbed it aside with his shotgun.  We ran for our lives, the mob of undead maniacs pursuing us all the while. Somehow, at some point, we lost them and managed to escape town and get back on the open road.

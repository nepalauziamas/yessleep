I grew up in a small mountain town in the Poconos of pennsylvania. No more than 200 hundred people, it was the kind of town where everyone knew everyone. Years back in the 1700s it was infamous for which hunts and stake burnings on account of a lot of the women in town at the time were suspected of witchcraft and black magic. With this came our town’s biggest urban legend, the wax lake. The story goes that in order to hide their witchcraft, they dug up a large crater in the middle of the woods, filled it with all their potions, spells, voodoo dolls, animal skulls and whatever you’d expect a witch to carry, along with a trove of twisted creatures made with dark magic to protect these items. They then melted down all their ritualistic candles, before pouring the liquid wax into the hole, eventually hardening and effectively  burying their stuff and its guardians. Well during the summer of my junior year, Me and my brother Conner found it.

It happened during a camping trip, one we took every year for the past 12 years. Our routine camp out quickly took a turn however once my brother Allen started telling the story of the wax lake much like the years prior. However, after finishing the tale this time, he followed it up with suggesting we go out to look for it, something we had not done since we were little kids. However this time we were nearly 18, and more capable to look, along with the help of a joint or two, we decided to make a hunt for the wax lake. Now we didn’t really expect anything more than a walk through the forest with chit chat, and maybe another smoke break…but that wasn’t the case.

“hoooly shiiit'' Conner let out in amazement as after almost an hour and a half of searching, we set our eyes on a giant, solidified sheet of red candle wax filled a wide oval like crater. I was speechless, never in a million years did I think I’d come across the actual wax lake of Middleville. After a few minutes of my silent astonishment while Conner flipping his shit, he asked me something that put me a little on edge. “Hey Dylan, you think all that freaky voodoo shits really in all that wax?” he asked, bumping my shoulder. I was so blown away by the fact the lake was real, I never thought of the stuff said to be buried in it looking at him raising. “you really wanna find out?” I asked as my brain ran through possibilities as to what could’ve happened here in the 100’s of years. His response was to roll his eyes, and grab a rather hefty stone. “Uh, what are you doing?” I asked somewhat nervously as he began cranking his arm back to throw it. “Relax man, it’s wax, not Ice.” He said, taking aim at the lake before firing. 

The rock flew through the air before crashing down into the large wax filled crater and with a large thump sounding what I can only describe as sticky, began to slowly sink downwards slightly and plant itself into the lake. “You see? no big deal.” He said with a confident smirk as he extended his arm outwards towards the rock…that began to sink deeper, and deeper, it didn’t take long for me to understand what was happening, the wax was melting, and at a rapid pace. “LOOK!” I shouted out as I frantically began pointing towards the now nearly liquified lake. Conner turned his head back towards the lake to see it now bubbling hot…and the things that began crawling out of it. 

half a dozen wolf like beasts, A hybrid of fabric and fur all stitched together, their over elongated mouths lined with what looked like dozens of small razor teeth.  exposed skulls surrounded by a main of tattered fur, their photonegative eyes staring deep into us, quickly getting into an attack position, ready to lounge at us, and among them all, A large skeletal sea serpent arose from the lake, standing at least two stories. The creature was an amalgamation of bone and scaled flesh, with glowing red eyes. Every part of my body was yelling at me, telling me to run, but I just couldn’t, it was as if my brain couldn’t process the horrible creatures I was seeing before me…until the skeletal water monster Raised its head and let out a deep, blood curdling scream, and the wolf creatures made their charge towards us.

My realization as to the danger kicked in as soon as I saw those hellish, witchcraft beasts making chase with me and my brother as its prey. I quickly grabbed Conner by the shirt collar and pulled him along me as I made a break for the woods. He soon began running himself thinking we were about to be torn apart, but these fuckers were fast, one of them ended up biting pretty deep into my leg, however my adrenaline was running through my system at full blast. I turned and kicked it in the face, releasing my leg and allowing us to escape. I was expecting some sort of hunt through the woods involving a chase, but I slowly realized as we got further away from the lake, the sound of our pursuers faded away until it was silenced. I turned around to see in the distance that the creatures never left the border between the woods and the lake, but stood right behind it, staring us down and giving deep growls. I took this as a sign that maybe they’ve been put under a spell by the witches that created them, preventing them from leaving the lakes perimeter, something I’m certainly grateful for.

It’s been about 5 years since me and my brother had recently come back home to visit our parents for spring break. About two weeks into our stay home and for some strange reason we both felt a strong need to go back to the lake. So we did just that, but the lake was completely gone, hell the crater was even filled, it looked as if there was never anything here at all…but there were things here, and I have a strong feeling, somewhere in these woods, there still is something

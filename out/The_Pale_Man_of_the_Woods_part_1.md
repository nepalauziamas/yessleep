I never really believed in the paranormal... sure there were weird things going on in the world but I didnt invest too much time trying to make sense of them. It always seemed to happen to someone else’ , and on a planet with billions of people someone was bound to encounter things that defied explanation. It was simply statistics. However after experiencing what happened to me, I realized it doesnt matter how improbable something is. Even the most unlikely event is completely real to the person going through it… and that person could be any of us.

I was away from home, studying for my degree at a regional university. The town surrounding the campus was relatively quiet and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. It exuded the typical modern suburb vibe and all the residents appeared friendly enough. Of course there was the odd sketchy person, and homeless people, but they were peaceful as long as you kept to yourself. It was almost idyllic, and felt like a nice place to live. However there was something unsettling about the forest cradling the small town. 

A suffocating atmosphere lingered about that place. It was as if a giant corpse lay upon the trees, smothering the forest in an air of foul decomposition. I loved nature, but I couldn’t find it in me to explore those woods. There was something unnatural about the place, like one of those uncanny valley faces you see on the internet. Crows never perched in its trees… They lived in the greenery of the university campus. It was a sign something was wrong. Almost as if the tender needles of the pine were a facade to conceal the decay that permeated the branches. 

I asked one of my professors about the forest. He explained to me, the area had an infestation of pine beetles, and local animals didnt like the chemicals administered to control the pests. It seemed reasonable enough. In fact it was so reasonable, it was enough to abate my anxiety on the matter. For a while I stopped thinking about the woods. I would still avoid it, but it was just something that was ‘there’, like the homeless on the streets or the creepy druggie behind the bus stop. Something unsettling but very much mundane. 

I didnt socialize much. Most of the time I locked myself in my dorm, working on assignments, and obsessively cleaning my living space. My neighbors tried their best to get to know me, we had some conversations, but it felt pretty awkward, as there was not really much to talk about.  There was a guy who had a crush on me…Eugene. He didnt try to conceal it either. He would try to sit close to me in class and would ‘accidentally’ bump into me in random places and start a conversation. Frankly it was borderline creepy, but he didnt have ill intent. He was just an awkward guy, and I loved all the free stuff he gave me, so I didnt reject him outright. 

I wish Eugene would have been be the creepiest part of my experience, but things could never be that simple.

I was walking back to my dorms one November afternoon. It was unusually warm for an autumn day, and the air was stale, like that you would expect inside an old cottage. Eugene was by my side. We had left the campus together and were planning to study for exams in my dorms.

“Are you scared?” His soft boyish voice interrupted the awkward silence.

“Of what?” I responded.

“The exams… I heard we’ll get sent home if our grades aren’t good enough” He answered quickly

I giggled

“Ive never gotten anything worse than excellent” I replied, smiling smugly.

“Oh… well Im not doing as well as you” He looked at his feet, there was a defeated tone in his voice.

An awkward silence hung over us until he spoke again, desperate to keep the conversation flowing.

“What are you planning for winter break?” he asked quietly

I was looking forward to some reprieve when I would get to stay at my parent’s house for the winter break. My life had developed into a routine and I craved for an interruption to the insufferable drawl of endless papers and exams.

“Going home…” I replied. “You?”

“Im staying here… Gotta help prof (redacted) with his data collection on the forest… only way I’ll pass”

I shuddered. I had nearly forgotten about the creepy woods and now it was thrust back to the forefront of my consciousness. Eugene must have noticed the change in my expression as he asked me if anything was wrong. 

“Im fine, Just kinda tired.” I replied as I smeared my hands on my yoga pants to brush off the sweat. “It is really warm today though!”

Eugene nodded in agreement. “Prof (redacted) seems to think it has something to do with the woods, something about psychobotanical conversion disorder…”

“Whats that?” I asked, genuinely curious.

He shrugged “Im not supposed to talk about it, and to be honest he hasnt really told me much either”

“I’ll let you stay for dinner if you tell me what you know” I teased

“alright” he replied excitedly, “You know how trees communicate with eachother through their roots right?”

“Oh its the fungus network thing!” I responded

“thats right. Well he thinks that the trees form a sort of quasi consciousness, that can manipulate regional weather and climate patterns.”

“so thats whats causing the weird weather?” I interrupted

He nodded his head and continued “ he thinks theres something wrong with the neural network in this forest, like its suffering from some sort of plant dementia… We are doing testing to confirm this”

Plant dementia… The thought was fascinating but also inexplicably unsettling.

“thanks Eugene” I replied softly

He shrugged. We didnt speak again for the rest of our walk.

As we entered the lobby of my complex, the cleaning lady gave us a stern look.

“You know MY RULES Ms. Calfe, no boys allowed.” She spat through pursed lips.

“Oh Mrs. (redacted), dont worry about him, he’s just a friend.” I replied innocently

“thats what they all say” she muttered grumpily as she ambled into the shadows of her janitor closet.

The rest of the afternoon was uneventful. We studied together for a few hours, and I felt strangely comforted by Eugene’s presence. I suppose I was alone for so long, that it felt nice to have some company. I made caper and olive spaghetti for the both of us to enjoy, and we had a pleasant evening playing video games. 

When he was ready to leave it was already dark

“wait” I called after him

Eugene turned around, it was apparent he was apprehensive about the thought of walking back to campus in the night

With some hesitation I spoke “You could… stay the night here, youre welcome to sleep on the couch, and I have spare tooth brush….”

“For who?” he asked

“thats none of your business” I retorted, slightly annoyed.

“Im sorry” he replied, visibly shaken, “I appreciate it Lorynn”

Feeling a little bad about my tone I added “Its brand new if youre wondering… I have it on hand in case someone needed to stay over. You’re the first”

“I bet thats what you say to all of them” He joked

I smiled, and we headed inside.

We became closer after that night. I even started approaching Eugene for conversations. He was a nice guy, and it felt good to have a friend. 

However Eugene started to change. At first I thought it was the stress of examinations looming around the corner, but he visibly grew anxious, almost fearful. One night as we were working on a lab assignment I confronted him.

“Whats wrong Eugene?” I asked gently

“Huh?” My question apparently caught him off guard. His eyes darted quickly away from the window and met mine. His expression was grave like he just saw a ghost.

“N-nothing, I think Im just going crazy”

“how so?” I responded

“its nothing… just my mind playing tricks on me” He answered, trembling.

Sensing his embarassment I promised I wont judge him and he shared his experience. “H-have you seen a thin man lurking around the town?” 

I froze. It seemed like the drone of the vents and refrigerators suddenly ceased, and a congealed silence permeated the lab.

“No… You mean like a druggie? or a creep? Are you being stalked Eugene? Lets tell campus security!”

“Its not like that…” He continued, beads of sweat dripped from the tip of his nose and disappeared into his umber sweater.

“I think he… it followed me back from the forest”

A chill pierced my spine, and I instinctively glanced across the room looking for the ‘thin man’. The mention of the forest made it even creepier.

“Have you tried seeing a counsellor?” I immediately regret my reply as it appeared I was discrediting him, but I had already spoken.

“No… Do you think I should?” He answered, surprisingly relieved by my suggestion.

“I think it will help… Youre under alot of stress Eugene, and I try my best to help, but Im really kinda going crazy too, haha” I responded.

Eugene managed to make a smile, it was apparent some burden had been lifted.  

“If you feel unsafe you could always stay at my place” I assured him.

He nodded and we parted ways. 

Unfortunately that would be the last time I would be able to talk with Eugene. I wish I stayed with him a little longer or spent more time with him that night, but it was too late.

The next time I saw Eugene was three days later…

A couple of police officers confronted me at my dorm.

“h-hello?” I greeted them, trying my best to hide the nervousness in my voice.

“Morning Ma’am we’re sorry to wake you so early on this Saturday but we need to get some information we think only you know, its about your friend Eugene”

My heart sank. A single tear rolled down my face and my voice started to tremble. I silently prayed that he would be ok, but I anticipated the worse.

“Of course… Come in?” I replied cordially

“Actually Ma’am youre coming with us… I think its best we talk somewhere more secure. If thats alright with you”

“yes” I answered.

The officers drove me deeper into the town. As we passed rows of condos and strip malls, I couldnt help but think about Eugene. My mind conjured endless possibilities of what may have happened to him. Perhaps he had gone insane and was being held in an asylum? Or whatever was following him had got him? I gripped the dark leather of the car seat so tight that my nails left white marks. My thoughts were interrupted when the car abruptly swerved off the main road and onto a dirt path. The police station was visible ahead, yet we made a hard right into what appeared to be some sort of industrial complex.

The officers realized I may have felt uneasy, so they reassured me.

“We’re heading to a different government building no need to worry”

I nodded.

Then he turned his head back towards me as if he remembered something important “Oh also Im gonna need to read you something alright? Its just protocol”

I nodded again, staring blankly into his nostrils.

He continued,  “Alrighty: The subject, thats you,  must swear that they shall not divulge of any intelligence accrued during the visit. Should said subject disclose confidential information to any private or public entity outside of relevant government agents, the (redacted) reserves the right to terminate the subject without notice or legal trial. Should the subject object to these terms they shall be refused entry into the facility and shall be prosecuted for failure to cooperate with (redacted) investigation which may result in fines or imprisonment.”

“Basically keep your mouth shut” His partner quipped.

I nodded, my eyes wide with anxiety.

“Good, Welcome to the (redacted) ma’am enjoy your stay.”

They dropped me off at the entrance of a decidedly modern structure. It was composed of many indigo pyramids cobbled together in a convoluted yet aesthetically pleasing arrangement. Pristine white walls connected each pyramid to eachother. In the sunlight it was possible to make out the silhouettes of people moving inside the pyramids. These were huge glass rooms, each housing numerous facilities. A short blond lady in a white labcoat greeted me at the entrance. 

“Hi Im Dr. (redacted) You must be Lorynn” She beamed, her small blue eyes glistened like beads.

“Yes! do you know what happened to Eugene? Is he ok?” I blurted out, I couldnt maintain my composure any more.

She nodded and motioned for me to follow, “your friend is alive, but he is not well” she replied firmly. 

Sunlight permeated the interior of the facility. The polished floor was ebony like obsidian, and there was an abundance of ornamental plants adorning its halls. The complex evoked the likeness of a shopping mall, yet there was a grimness to it that was akin to a hospice or cemetary. No amount of natural light could quell the profound dread that lurked within the facility.

“Is this a place where you study diseases?” I asked tactfully.

“sort of” she replied. “ Not the sort of diseases regular people know about”

She escorted me to an elevator and as we got in she asked me.

“Do you believe in spirits Lorynn?”

“N-no” I answered shakily, startled by her question.

she smiled, “good girl… There’s no such thing as spirits”

As we reached our destination she turned towards me again and informed me “You may see some things that are kind of unpleasant… Do not maintain eye contact with… erm… the ‘patients’, for more than several seconds.”

I nodded, wideeyed with fear.

The elevator opened to a dark hallway. The only illumination came from rows of blue led lights that lined the floor. As my eyes adjusted to the darkness I could make out the shape of people in labcoats peering into odd aquarium like rooms. Suddenly I realized what the giant aquariums were, they were holding cells, and the people, no, things they imprisoned were enough to make one faint.

I glanced an emaciated woman with patchy hair crawling on all fours, she scurried across the sides and ceiling of her cell, her bloated belly pressed against the glass.

The researchers observing her studied her closely, jotting down notes in a fury. They were wearing odd goggles that extended from their faces like binoculars. The cold light from the blue LED crept onto their white labcoats and bathed them in a sickly pallor.

Another cell held a doll-like androgynous figure curled up in a corner. Its moans penetrated the thick glass walls and spawned nightmares in my mind. I was glad it was facing the other way.

Dr. (redacted) guided me through the hall. Some of the containment cells were enclosed in steel. I shuddered to think what horrors lurked within. 

Eventually we reached a brightly lit cell, labeled (redacted). It was roomier than the other enclosures and contained a single bed and toilet. Sitting on the bed was, Eugene.

“Thats your friend” Dr (redacted) stated.

“Can I talk to him?” I inquired.

She motioned me to be quiet.

There was something wrong with him. His face seemed ‘off’. His large brown eyes were sunken in his skull and his lips were tightly closed, forming a thin almost imperceptible line. He rose from his bed and wandered disorientedly before collapsing on the floor, writhing, seemingly in pain.

“whats wrong with him?” I asked in a hushed whisper

“We were hoping you would know” Dr (redacted) replied “He became like this immediately after last seeing you”

Tears dribbled down my cheeks as I remembered his face. He had soft boyish features and messy auburn hair, now replaced with an eerie mask formed from spindly bone and wizened sinew topped with a matted clump of oily hair.

“Im sorry” I mumbled, my voice trembling from grief. “I need time to process this…”

Dr (redacted) smiled warmly, attempting to comfort me. “Lets get something to drink, we have the best cafeteria in the country”

I met her gaze and nodded. “I’d like that”

Sunlight shimmered through the hexagonal tiles of the glass pyramid and cast spidery shadows across our table. The turquoise of the blue daiquiri in my hand turned emerald in the gleam of the setting sun. There were other researchers seated at tables nearby. All of them delighted in cheerful conversation, none seemed disconcerted by the dreadful creatures and unfortunate souls held captive in the facility.

“Was he acting strange that day?” Dr (redacted) inquired “Also please call me Sam”

“ N-no” I stammered “ but he mentioned he felt like he was being followed”

Sam’s eyebrows furled, and her smile faded, she pulled out a tablet from her labcoat and began typing.

“by what?” she asked

“He said it was a thin man… and from the looks of it, it seemed like it was following him everywhere” I informed her.

“Thank you Lorynn, that is valuable info, did he mentioned when these symptoms occured?” She continued.

“He said it followed him out of the woods… The (redacted) park around the university campus” I answered.

“thin man, paranoia, hallucinations, distress, got it” Sam muttered to herself. She turned off her tablet and placed it back under her labcoat. “Lorynn, thank you for telling us what you know, now its only fair for me to return the favor.” Sam’s smile returned, her blue eyes drifted pensively towards a potted plant nearby, she paused for a moment then opened her mouth. I leaned in attentively to hear what she had to say.

“your friend has a very aggressive form of neuropathic degeneration… Very unusual. Its like all the connections between his cortical neurons are being severed. He is also experiencing severe muscle wasting and erosion of the peripheral nervous system.” She paused to observe my expression, realizing I understood her jargon perfectly, she continued. “we see similar things in alzheimers patients, but this is occuring at a much faster pace. Furthermore its not caused by prions or amyloid plaques, it almost seems like there is no organic cause, like its a conversion disorder.” Her insights sent a chill jolting up my spine. “Now Im not supposed to share this with you but there have been several instances in the past with similar presentation admitted to our facility, but it gets creepier” her eyes widened with what appeared to be a mix of intrigue and passion. “At the moment their mental processes fully ceased, new connections started to form between neurons essentially restoring their functionality! but the subjects no longer behaved like people… I can’t share exactly what happened to them unfortunately, because you know… confidentiality”

I nodded

She sipped her matcha tea and stood up.

“its getting late… I should drive you home” Sam remarked, pretending to look at her watch.

As we approached the entrance of the facility, I looked over my shoulder and silently bid Eugene good bye. I felt it would be the last time I ever saw him.

The buildings cast lanky purple shadows across the landscape and everything was bathed in a tepid orange light. It seemed like we were chasing the sun as it slowly crept behind the horizon.

“Do you know prof (redacted)?” Sam asked, her eyes fixed on the road.

“Yes, he is our… Me and Eugene’s botany professor” I replied groggily.

She chuckled “You know if you ever feel scared about this situation you can talk to him… he’ll help you”

“I should stay out of the woods right?” I asked Sam

She appeared surprised “No… Why would you need to do that? are you afraid it has something to do with your friend’s illness? I assure you there is no such connection” 

She glanced at me briefly, studying my expression.

“Remember Lorynn, theres no such thing as spirits” 

I nodded, and my eyes rested on the sliver of orange light that formed the edge of the horizon. When we arrived at my dorm it was late evening. Sam told me it wouldnt be the last time she saw me and she would get in touch soon. She stressed it was imperative that I did not describe any of the things I witnessed to anyone. I assured her I would keep quiet.

That night I dreamed of walking through the forest… I had what looked like a thermometer in my hand, and I stabbed it into the soil around the base of a tree. The device shone red and beeped furiously, nervously I looked around. A murder of dead crows were sprawled around me, their eyes a milky white. Panicking I ran along a trail, hoping it would lead me out of the woods, but it seemed like it was taking me further into its depths. Eventually I ran into a clearing surrounded by ancient pines. There was a solitary, pale figure at the end of the trail. It was dressed in repulsive soiled rags, and had its back turned to me. What little hair remained on its head fluttered about madly on its pasty scalp. Each vertebrae on its unnaturally long back was clearly visible and its lanky legs lifted it at least ten feet from the ground. It stood there with its wizened limbs wrapped around its body and its fingers were like gnarled white roots. Then there was a crow’s caw, Eugene appeared in front of me, his face contorted in pain. He shook his head and motioned me to run. The crow cawed again this time sounding more like a human scream, and a flock of crows covered the forest like a veil…

I woke up sweating. It was pitch black in my room, and I hurried to turn on the lights. A pair of crows perched on my balcony, lazily they cocked their heads towards me as if to acknowledge my existence. Their presence was comforting.

Whatever afflicted Eugene still lurked somewhere in those odious trees, where no animal dared to tread. I dreaded whatever was out there but I needed answers. It would offer me some closure, and as much as I hesitated to admit it, I cared for Eugene. Part of me wanted to do it for him.

Next part coming soon.

When we were kids we all thought Freddy must be the biggest person in the world.  He was six foot five and broad as a refrigerator, and though his sheer size was certainly impressive, his intellect was not.  From the mismatched and sloppy clothes featuring children’s cartoon characters to the disheveled hair and the slack look of disinterest that perpetually graced his  features, one look at Freddy was enough to let you know that he was slow.  Nobody on our street had ever heard him say a word, and as far as we knew he couldn’t talk at all.

He was in his early twenties, which meant that he’d been in the neighborhood for as long as any of us kids could remember, so most of us paid him no mind.  And he really wouldn’t do much of anything exciting; just stand in the front yard and watch the girls as they came home from school.

So, when Freddy followed the schoolgirls of the neighborhood to their homes one day, we found it a little odd, but certainly nothing to be overly worried about.  The strange thing was that he did it again the next day, and the day after that.  At this point us girls started to get a little unnerved, but we didn’t think about telling anyone what was going on.  After all, we all knew Freddy.  He was harmless, right?

So we just ignored it.  A couple of the braver girls tried asking him to stop, but all they got in response was Freddy’s slack-jawed stare.  I guess he really couldn’t talk after all.  It seemed like things would just go on like this forever, until what happened to Sarah.

Sarah was the one in our group who lived the farthest away from the school, which meant that every day she walked the last half mile to her house alone.  Well, not exactly alone; she had Freddy.  Well, one day she never came home.  Her mom waited, called our moms- no one knew where she was.  That’s when Eleanor finally piped up about Freddy.

Eleanor’s mom called Sarah’s mom, and Sarah’s mom called the cops.  When they went to Freddy’s house, they found her in the living room, shaking like a leaf as Freddy sat on the floor and stared at her. Her story went that he had grabbed her up out of the street and tucked her under his arm like a football, sprinting the distance to his house, and setting her down on the living room sofa.  She was too afraid of what he’d do to her if she screamed for help so she just stayed there and closed her eyes.

But Freddy didn’t do anything to her.  For the two hours that he had her there all he did was stare.

After that there was talk of locking Freddy up, but seeing as he hadn’t actually done anything to harm the girl, the police let him off with a slap on the wrist and sent an escort to walk the girls home from school every day.  That’s just the way things are done in small towns I guess.

Well, this didn’t sit right with us girls for obvious reasons, but what could we do?  We all figured we’d be safe as long as the officer was there.  

Unfortunately, the officer didn’t much care for his ‘babysitting’ duty, and one day when an emergency call came through dispatch he decided to ditch us and head off to do some ‘real policework.’


That day we decided we’d all walk Sarah to her house together.  Safety in numbers, right?  We were about a half mile from the house when we heard a noise like a wounded animal, and loud enough to make our ears hurt.  We all turned around to find  the source, and Sarah screamed as she saw it--Freddy was barreling towards us as fast as his tree trunk legs could carry him, mouth agape and wailing.

We all booked it, scattering  like balls on a pool table.  He ignored us, making a beeline for Sarah, when a gunshot cracked the air like lightning.  Freddy’s shoulder jerked back, but he didn’t slow down.  I stopped for a moment expecting to see the officer, but I didn’t.  

A man had grabbed hold of Sarah with one hand and was waving the gun with the other as he dragged her to a windowless van. Sarah was screaming and biting the man’s arms, but he didn’t even seem to notice as he dragged her back.  I can still remember how wide his eyes were, the pupils expanded like black bottomless pits, swallowing up the iris.

Freddy’s shoulder wound had soaked through his shirt as he raced towards the two of them.  The man raised the pistol again and the air was broken by a loud crack--the crack of Freddy’s fist slamming into the man’s jaw.

I’ve never seen anyone hit someone else that hard since,  but the man’s face instantly gave way and he flew through the air like a rag doll.

Sarah wrenched herself out of his limp fingers and just stood there staring wide-eyed at Freddy, but Freddy didn’t say anything.  He just patted her on the head like you would a puppy and then sat down on the ground and stared into space as the blood from his shoulder slowly soaked his shirt.

The police investigation revealed that the man had spotted Sarah one day as she walked home from school and begun following her. Inside the van they found rope, duct tape, knives, and about a dozen journals filled with psychotic ramblings about Sarah, along with a large supply of PCP. If that wasn’t enough to shake us girls up, the police matched his DNA to three open rape/murder cases of teenage girls in the state.

Freddy ended up being fine--even though the doctors said he should have bled out, the wound hardly seemed to faze him.  He lost a little function in his arm, but other than that he was fine.  And after that, none of us protested when Freddy wanted to walk us [home.](http://Facebook.com/lifeisstrangemetoo)

Yes, shouldn’t I be more worried on other things like surviving? Well I’d rather leave something just incase the weird tragedy of our batch unveils to the whole world, at least someone has to tell the story.

Love live Class of 2016.

My name is Ivan and I’m from a family which never attended such prestigious schools or universities which we think we can barely afford. Plus, all schools are practically the same, differentiated by facilities and way of teaching. 

Me wanted to pursue a Major in Finance, I enrolled myself to our local University hoping to graduate on time and to land a job as soon as I graduate to help around the family on bills and debts. Luckily after 4 years in college (while working part-time at McDonald’s) I graduated with honors last 2020.

Throughout my college life, I was friends with 2 other people who was also a part of “Class of 2016” in our high-school: George and Avery.

Both George and Avery pursued the course of Marketing. All being under the same Degree of Business Administration, there are some classes were in we all attend the same time. We also hangout during the weekends like normal college students and we are all practically close to each other throughout our college life. 2 years after graduation, we all still kept in touch.


I landed a job on our local Bank while George was recruited by a Marketing firm. Avery, on the other hand, started his own advertising business. Just like good ol’ days, we usually hang out on Friday nights and tend to talk about how shitty life has been, who won the last NBA game or any life goals in the next couple of months.

This morning, we received a call from some of our high-school classmates, all three of us had an unexpected tragic news:

“Mr. Dono passed away this morning at 3 AM. Details of the wake will be cascaded this afternoon.”

Mr. James Donovan or better known as Mr. Dono was our homeroom teacher way back 2016. Everybody loved him for his way of teaching, trying his absolute best in every lesson he shared. Aside from school lessons, he always taught us the beauty of life itself and how we should cherish every moment. Other Batches called us lucky since way back 2015, Mr. Dono was a newly-hired teacher and after our graduation last 2016, he eventually had to resign due to personal reasons. Long story short, we were the first and only batch he handled.

On the venue of the Wake, we saw familiar faces from both Faculty and batch mates. 3 of us being the most closest among the batch, George, Avery and I sat all together on the 4th aisle. In the front, Mrs. Rachel Donovan, Mr. Dono’s wife, was preparing for her eulogy.

“He was not just a good husband, but he was also the perfect husband a woman like me wished for. He was so selfless towards other people. To our neighbors, to our relatives and even to his students, loving them as if they were ours. Everyday, He showered me with amazing stories of what his day was at school. Despite being a homeroom teacher for only just a year, it was, I believe, one of the most memorable moment of his life. I was so happy to see some of his students here today, And…”

Mrs. Donovan stopped as soon as our eyes met.

“And I…”

“And I know…he’ll be happy as well.”

Mrs. Donovan finishes the sentence while our eyes are still locked at each other. As if she was surprised to see me.

Or as if, she has something to tell me.


Fast forward an hour later, both George and Avery had a little bit of catching up with a few batch mates of ours while I stood up alone in front of Mr. Dono’s body. I was actually reminiscing our previous memories together. I was not a teacher’s favorite but hell, we did a lot of things together more that he would with other kids. Out of the blue, Mrs. Donovan approached me and started talking to me.

“He was looking for you.”

I looked to her and said

“I’m sorry Ma’am?”

Mrs. Donovan looked at the casket:

“His final words were about you.”

I was very silent after hearing what Mrs. Donovan said. I was eager to ask what was that all about but before I asked, George and Avery approached us for them to say their last messages to Mr. Dono and to formally inform Mrs. Donovan that we are leaving. George and Avery quickly dragged me also outside the premises and as soon as we were inside the car, I asked what was that for.

George and and Avery both looked pale and I already knew something was off.

George looked at me with a concerned face:

“Ivan, this was the 4th time.”

“4th time of what?”

There was a long silence in the car and Avery at the back seat finally broke the silence:

“Ivan, remember our classmate, Anna? She died in a motorcycle accident 2 weeks ago overseas. 3 days after that, Marcus, who was also our classmate and played for the school basketball team, died after hitting a pole due to drunk driving. After 3 days, Melanie, the cute girl who sat in front of George, was accidentally pushed to the railway on a subway and was instantly killed by an approaching train.”

Avery continued:

“The death of Melanie was 3 days ago, Ivan.”

It was too much for me to absorb all at once to be honest and I was trying to convince myself that such tragedy happens. It may have just happened all in a very inconvenient (but creepy) timeline.

George was looking in front, staring at a distance and said:

“Excluding Mr. Dono….”

“Anna Anastacia”
“Marcus Apollo”
“Melanie Benneth”

Ivan, they are all dying alphabetically. 4 more and you’re next.”

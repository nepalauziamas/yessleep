It’s not every day you wake up curled up at the back of a school bus with no memory of who you are.

And one thought in your mind lingering like a bad smell.

“I’ve been gassed.”

I always wondered what it would be like to be gassed. Not in a masochistic way. 

It was more of a curiosity.

When I was a kid one of the boy’s in my class had a tooth taken out and talked obsessively about having to be put to sleep and being completely knocked out. It sounded exciting. I mean, it did as a ten year old kid. Kids are weird. Some steer clear of danger, while others throw themselves into it for the thrill and curiosity of just how far they can push their pain tolerance. I was one of those kids—and Jamie Grant’s overexaggerated story about being gassed at the dentist made me want to experience it too. 

 If I were to write a letter to my ten-year-old self I would call him a fucking idiot. It wasn’t exactly surprising to find out that my strange childhood obsession with being knocked out wasn’t as fun as I’d imagined. No colours and dancing shadows, no seeing a bright light and witnessing my life flash in front of my eyes.  It was dark.

 All I remember is the dark and suffocating on my own breath—my tongue choking my mouth.

 I woke up to the sharp pain of what felt like a metal rod being pierced through my skull. I remember drifting back to some kind of reality with a pounding headache, a dry mouth and the overwhelming urge to projectile vomit everything I’d eaten.

My body was stiff and unmoving no matter how much I tried to force it into fruition, and there was a sense of dread curling in my gut, a feral fear catapulting me into fight or flight. But I didn’t know what I was scared of. I just knew there was something, a shadow bleeding in the back of my mind and forcing my brain and body to escape it, pulling at a memory struggling to resurface but no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t envelope myself in my own identity.

There’s something terrifying about existing in a body and being aware of being  alive and breathing, and yet that body didn’t have a name. I didn’t know my name, my age, who I was. Everything I was had been torn away and I was left with an empty cavern in the back of my spinning head, and the feeling of knowing—knowing it, and yet not. My name was so close. It was in reach, so easy to throw out my arms into the recesses of my mind and pluck it from the spiralling hurricane. It wasn’t as easy as that though. I was nameless. I was an empty shell.

For the short time I was frozen, paralysed and stuck in a seemingly endless dark— I was nobody.

All I could really do was focus on what was around me – and my senses.

Taste. I could taste something sour, like bile, on my tongue and teeth.

Smell. Old socks, body odour and a brief smell of cheese puffs.

I was faced down on something—carpet? 

I could feel prickly fibres spiking me in the cheeks and the stink of sweat and barf curling at the back of my nose and throat, teasing my gag reflex. Fuck. I was going to choke to death on my own vomit. What a way to go. I couldn’t move. That was the scariest part. I couldn’t breathe—a heavy weight on my chest like I’d been winded. As I lay there dazed and confused, my head spinning itself off its axis, I started to theorise on what exactly had happened to me. It’s not like I could rely on my memories. They were none-existent, at least for the time being.

I knew they were in reach, but my brain was too busy trying to figure out what the fuck had happened to me before it started to remind me of who exactly I was. It felt like when you go for a nap in the afternoon and sleep for seven or eight hours, and when you wake up you briefly forget who you are. 

It was like that, but tenfold.  I wondered if I’d ever move again. Maybe I was paralysed—maybe I’d been in an accident and I was stuck inside my own dead body; awareness inside and scooped out shell.

 But the more I thought about it, I definitely wasn’t in the hospital. I’d be able to hear the loud beeps of the monitors and low murmurs, conversations drifting in from the hall. I might have been able to feel the prick of an IV in my wrist or sheets and pillows cradling me. There was none of that. I wasn’t on a drip. The shit inside me was definitely not medical and had been administered against my will. 

I was still choking on the stuff when I managed to open my mouth a fraction. It was like breathing in fire—the type of pain I’d never experienced and didn’t want to experience, what felt like an ignition of flames climbing up my throat and burning me inside out. With gathering energy I flopped back onto my stomach. My best bet was to stay faced down with my nose and mouth pressed against the floor. It was uncomfortable and smelled like shit, sure, but it was better than breathing in whatever had knocked me out in the first place. Thankfully, I didn’t stay nameless for long. I think my brain had gone into panic mode and was recuperating itself. 

It took maybe five minutes to move my arm—then another five minutes to force myself onto my back, crack open an eye and suck in sharp breaths of musty air. Wherever I was there was no window—and if there was it wasn’t open. When the world stopped spinning and my vision cleared slightly, I realised I was staring at the roof of a bus. 

A sharp glance to the left and then the right showed me rows of empty seats with the same pattern which I instantly recognised. I’d seen it before, and with it came a rush of something.

 Not quite a memory, but the start of one. My foggy brain was starting to clear. It was dark outside, and I glimpsed raindrops on the windows running parallel to each other. For some reason, though, I couldn’t stop staring at the seats.

I knew them.

It wasn’t a core memory, something which was important.

It was...recent. It felt recent. Squinting at the seats, or more specifically, the patterns on them, I’d seen them before. Slowly, my body started to come back to me, first my arms and legs, and then my torso. 

With it came clarity and logic seeping back into fruition. I  was at the very back of the bus, curled up under the back seat.  It didn’t look like a public one, or a coach, though one glance at the windows told me everything I needed to know. I was on a school bus. I  half wondered if I’d fallen asleep on the way to school and fallen off of the seat— or maybe I was the victim of accidental poisoning by an industrial cleaner sterilizing the bus. 

But then I remembered I was a 22 year old drama student. I’d been out of school for almost five years, and even then I’d always biked to class.

So, how the hell was on a school bus?

“An audition?”

My own voice shattered my thoughts, and I was dragged back to my university classroom five days earlier. I’d spent the whole class struggling to stay awake. The day was over and I was gathering up my things with clumsy hands.

All I could think about was getting back to my dorm room before the assholes next door started blasting music. It had been happening all week, and I’d had maybe five hours sleep in total. Class had been a drag, and I had been struggling to stay awake. The sound of my name being called out had woke me up, however, and I automatically knew I was in trouble. 

Sleeping in class wasn’t ideal, though teacher’s could understand. But I wasn’t even sleeping. I was somewhere between dissociating and watching whatever the girl in front of me was staring at on her laptop. Ten minutes later the classroom was empty and I was still mulling my professor’s words in my head. He was in front of me cleaning the board and hadn’t spoken since uttering those damn words.

“So! Have you managed to get an audition yet?”

“An audition?” I’d repeated groggily, not really paying much attention.

After that… nothing. I expected him to say more, but he’d just started cleaning up.

So, I figured I’d head out.

When I thrust my laptop in my bag, he turned around to face me, regarding me with what I could only describe as a pitying smile. Almost a year with him and he’d only given that look to two students. Bella Torres and Luca Marine. Both of whom he’d kicked out for being time wasters. They had been good performers but weren’t good enough. “Ryan.” 

Professor Carlisle pinched the skin between his brows like it was paining him to talk to me. I started to wonder if that was it. Maybe we were going to have the same conversation he’d had with the others. The ”It’s not working out” talk.

Suddenly the walls felt like they were closing in.

“Remind me again. Why did you apply for this college?”

My phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it, taking an awkward seat on the edge of my desk.

It was an easy enough question to answer, but my stomach still twisted.

“I want to be an actor.”

“Exactly.” Professor Carlisle nodded.

"So, why is this our third conversation this month? I give you role’s to apply to, you say yes, and then you ignore me and hope I haven’t noticed. And I have noticed, Ryan. We all have.”

So this was an intervention, I thought. 

Shouldering my bag, I folded my arms across my chest. “I applied to one last week.”

“That was an extra role.” Professor Carlisle sighed. “You know, this would be so much easier if you were a bad performer,” He chuckled. “I mean, yeah, if you sucked I could kick you out and it wouldn’t ruin my day because I only care about students I see potential in. Which is you, Ryan. I’ve seen your improv, I’ve seen you work as part of a group, and in recitals. I’ve seen your talent!” The man was slowly going red in the face. I couldn’t tell if he was pissed or just really passionate about all of us. 

“Ryan, every student in this class excels including you, and yet you make no effort to apply for roles that will get your foot in the door, you know? That’s how you make it! You don’t make it through film school! I mean sure, it helps if you go there,” Professor Carlisle was vibrating with elation, an energy I was envious of, “You just need to know the right people who will open those doors for you.” 

I watched the man pace up and down, grabbing random things and waving them around before doing a dramatic spin to me. “So, Ryan. Why is it hard for you do that, hmm? I know you have confidence! I’ve seen it on the stage! You could walk into any audition right now and blow every hopeful out of the water, so why not?”

I wasn’t sure how to explain my dorm situation, so I just nodded and smiled. “I’m going to.”

Professor Carlisle’s smile widened. “Yes, you are.” He shoved a piece of paper in my face. “I think you should go for a lead role. And by that, I don’t mean a best friend or a boyfriend. None of that. I mean the main character.”

I glanced at the flyer. It was a printed out casting call for a project named “PINK LILY”.


·         Untitled Superhero movie.


·         Male/Female/Non-Binary.


·         18-30 years old.


·         All ethnicities.


·         Must have experience.


“Pink Lily?” I frowned at the name, my gaze skimming over the text. There wasn’t a lot of information compared to other casting call’s I’d looked at. This one was the bare minimum. I folded up the flyer and stuffed it into my pocket, flashing my Professor a smile which definitely didn’t mean I had no interest whatsoever in a random movie which almost sounded like a porno. When I started towards the door, the teacher followed me.

“It’s a placeholder name,” He said. “They can’t disclose the actual name. It’s a big movie.”

“Really? I settled him with a sceptical smile. “They didn’t even specify the role.”

“That’s the point!”

 Professor Carlisle let out an overexaggerated sigh. “Do you really think they would advertise if  it was for a big project? They’ve already got favourites playing for big parts. What they need is a fresh face. Ryan, you have been in my class for two years now and are still unbelievably naive. For projects on a larger scale, the auditions are low-key. People will still know about them, but the name of the movie and the roles of the characters will not be plastered on the front of the public casting sheet. That would be asking for a disaster.” 

“Anyway, that’s not the point! I want you to go for this role to get yourself out there. Step out of your comfort zone and force yourself to do something you wouldn’t normally do. Who knows, it could be your big break.” The way my Professor was talking, he was hyping me up more than he should have been. He did it to all of us, my whole class, but at times it could get tiring. Especially on a Tuesday night with four assignments to do and a final showcase I hadn’t started. I turned my attention to him. The man was practically hyperventilating.

One thing kept my curiosity though.

A big movie, he’d said.

Which movie? Did I know the franchise?

“Do you know what movie it is?” I asked, trying and failing to make eye contact with him.

When you’re tired you focus on things you normally ignore, and your perception is all fucked up.

In the ten or maybe fifteen minutes I’d spent talking to him, I’d developed a sudden deep fascination with my professor’s abnormally large caterpillar-like eyebrows. Everything else he was saying was white noise and buzzing in my ears. He shook his head, his eyebrows twitching. “I’ve only been informed it’s going to be huge.”

Knowing my teacher’s standards, it was probably an A24 movie with a weird plot.

Well, it was my time to skedaddle—or I really was going to pass out.

 “Yeah, I’ll check it out.” I turned away from him, my gaze skimming the pattern walls which looked like they were swimming, waves weaving in and out, in and out. I had to blink rapidly to make sure I was seeing things.

Man, I needed sleep.

“Ryan.”

When I was  pulling open the door, the man’s change of tone stopped me in my stride.

“If you don’t go for this audition, or at least try, I don’t want you coming to class anymore.”

His words took a moment to register, and suddenly I was tongue tied. Five consecutive sleepless nights suddenly hit me and I was breaking through the mind fog which had been choking me for days. I twisted around to him. “Are you fucking serious?”

The Professor nodded grimly.  “I’ll be checking. I know the organisers quite well.”

“But—” I struggled to speak. “Look, I’m…I’m not sleeping well. I can’t even think straight!”

“Then maybe you chose the wrong profession. Actors do not come up with excuses, they swallow their fear and stand in front of the camera, regardless of illness or sleepless nights. They do it because they have to. It’s their job to and they get paid a hell of a lot.” Professor Carlisle cleared his throat. “Just try. That’s all I’m asking.”

I had to bite back a groan. “Did you not listen to anything I just said?”

“Yes. You continue to prove me right. You want to be an actor but refuse to put in the work.”

I swallowed hard. Maybe that was my wakeup call.  “Professor Carlisle—"

“Good night, Ryan.”

Before I could choke out a reply, the man strode over and gave me one last patronising smile before slamming the door directly in my face. I left campus that night feeling sick to my stomach and light-headed, but I knew he was right.

 I wasn't putting in 100%. How could I expect a starring role to just come to me? Actors, performers, artists-- everyone in the industry lived off of caffeine to keep them awake. They didn't rely on sleep. 

Sleep was a luxury. It hit me that I'd been putting so much work into my written assignments, I'd barely paid attention to the practical side. At least half of my classmates already had extra roles, or even bigger ones. I was the only one who hadn't taken that step-- and my Professor had been right to wake me up.  So, I went back to my dorm, ordered take-out, and practised lines in front of the mirror. They were old lines, from some play I'd starred in during my freshman year. But I was determined to prove my Professor wrong. 

Four days later I was in some stuffy studio with no air-conditioning, awkwardly squished between a dozen other hopefuls crowding a long, winding corridor. I'm not going to fully describe the audition process in vivid detail because I'll be here all day.

I'll give you the short version. Professor Carlisle was right, the movie must have been big. The doors were swamped with security. I'd arrived at around 9am just to be safe, and after glancing at my phone for the hundredth time, it was already midday. 

I'd started off standing like others, but eventually, after nearly 3 hours my legs were ready to collapse, so I planted myself on comfortable carpet next to a guy bobbing his head to his music, his eyes closed. I'll give you the short version. Professor Carlisle was right, the movie must have been big.

The doors were swamped with security. I'd arrived at around 9am just to be safe, and after glancing at my phone for the hundredth time, it was already midday.

I'd started off standing like others, but eventually, after nearly 3 hours my legs were ready to collapse, so I planted myself on comfortable carpet next to a guy bobbing his head to his music, his eyes closed. The kid seemed to hide under a yellow sweatshirt, the hood pulled up over dark brown curls. 

I recognised the beats in his music. My roommate was obsessed with Kanye West, so, naturally, I'd somehow managed to memorise half of his songs. The song the guy was vibing to definitely was Kanye, though I hadn't heard it. 

After a while of turning my phone on and off, I nudged him. At first, he didn't react, enveloped deep in his music. I elbowed him again. This time he jolted slightly, his expression momentarily twisting with annoyance, before he pasted on a smile. 

"Yeah?" The guy pulled out an Air Pod. I could tell by the slightly wild look in his eyes, that he was either contemplating pretending  he hadn't noticed me.

"Is that Kanye?”

He looked mildly horrified, scrambling with his phone in his lap.  “Oh, shit, man. Is it too loud?”

“No, is that a new song? I’ve never heard it.”

His lips twitched into a smile.. "It's the new album."

"You got it early?" 

The guy shrugged. "I know people." 

"Bullshit. You're listening to a two-and-a-half-minute Twitter leak." A small blonde girl in front of us twisted around to face us. I hadn’t even noticed her, only a glimpse of golden curls blurring together with hundreds of other faces in line. She reached out and grabbed the boy's phone, showing me the screen. 

Sure enough, there was a tweet on the screen, an audio recording already halfway through. "See?" The girl shot me a grin and held out her hand. She had an energy I was automatically jealous of. "I'm Tandy. That's Kaz. The compulsive liar."

The guy, or Kaz’s, eyes flashed. “You can talk!”

I couldn't resist a smile. "You two know each other?"

Kaz rolled his eyes. "She's in my class and followed me here. I’m this close to getting a restraining order.”

"Oh, don't be like that," Tandy smirked. "I'm growing on you." 

"Like a fungus, Tandy.”

“What he means,” Tandy sang, “Is that we made a pact that neither of us would try out for this role.”

Kaz tipped his head back with a sigh. “And yet here you are.”

“So are you.” Tandy folded her arms accusingly. “What happened to your sick grandpa?”

“Miraculously recovered.” Kaz raised a brow. “Aren’t you supposed to have the stomach flu?”

“I drank some water, asshole.”

He scoffed, a smile curving on his lips. “Oh, sure.”

With a maniacal grin, Tandy poked him in the cheek. “You swore on your life. On the life of your grandpa.”

Kaz hissed out. “I don’t even have a fucking grandpa!”

“So you lie about relatives too?” She teased, prodding him with every word. “Is. Your. Name. Even. Kaz?”

“Oh, knock it off.”

That was how I met Kaz and Tandy. Two rival classmates who I was sure would have murdered one another if it meant getting a starring role. The two of them had undeniable chemistry though, like a brother and sister bond.

Tandy shoved Kaz, and Kaz wasn’t afraid to shove her back, twice as harder.

It didn’t take long after that for me to be called into the auditioning room. It wasn’t anything special, just an ordinary room with a table and three people sitting in front of it, glasses of water and paper in front of them.

A woman with dark red hair led me inside and when she stationed me in front of them, a middle aged man wearing a suit shook his head. “No.” He said, before picking up his glass and draining it. “Next person, please.”

I was startled for a moment. His comment was jarring. When I looked at the other two, a smiling woman and another man who looked like he was melting from the heat, they nodded along with the speaker. Still, I smiled politely and nodded, though I was shaking. I hadn’t even opened my mouth yet and it was already a rejection. “I haven’t tried out yet.”

“We’ve seen enough,” The man said. He inclined his head. “How old are you?”

“Twenty-two.” I said through my teeth.

“Twenty-two?!” He let out a loud laugh. “I thought you were in your early thirties! Jeez, have you heard of moisturiser?”

I laughed along, but his words felt like knives sticking into my back.

Ouch.

“Next!”

Before I could explain myself or beg for another chance, I was told to leave. 

Kaz was standing outside, and I shouldered past him. Glimpsing him in the crowd only made me angrier. He was perfect for the role, of course he was. The guy looked like he’d just stepped out of a modelling career. Suddenly it was so hard to breathe, and I wanted to get as far away from that room as possible. I heard Kaz say something, but his words were drowned out by the crowd. Pushing back through the crowd, I headed for the exit, revelling in a fresh breeze which tickled my bare arms. I was halfway over the threshold when a hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back. Tandy.

Her eyes were friendly enough.

 "Are you okay?" She asked. "Dude, I thought we were going to hang out after?"

Tandy pointed over her shoulder. "Kaz just got called in. He told me to come get you.”

Oh, yeah, I thought. I forgot the three of us had arranged to hang out. 

I shook my head, wanting nothing more than to go back to my car and knock myself out on the steering wheel. "I'm not feeling great," I said. "I'm gonna go home."

The girl didn't look convinced, but she nodded. "Did everything go okay? I mean, with the audition.”

There was no way I was going to tell her I'd been rejected for looking too old. I'd take it to the grave.

"Yeah, it went fine,” I lied. “They're, uh, they're gonna call me."

"Oh?" Tandy's expression brightened. "Well, good luck!" She spun around, her dress twirling with her.

"I'll see you soon! Rain check?"

“Yeah. Sure.”

“Promise?” Her voice faded when I passed the security guard. “Hey, wait! What’s your number?”

I didn’t reply, stepping out into the early May heat. It was too warm to drive, and I really didn’t want to walk all the way back to the dorm. I lost all concept of time sitting on a bench and staring at the ground, silently damning Professor Carlisle to an eternity of suffering. When I finally looked up, the sun was dipping behind an expanse of clouds. I grabbed for my phone in my pocket, my heart jumping into my throat when my fingers didn’t find its familiar bulge sticking from my jeans. 

I tried the other pocket. Still nothing.

 Then I remembered sitting with Kaz and Tandy before the audition. I’d pulled it out to check the time before leaving it on the carpet. I didn’t remember picking it up. Fuck. I jumped up, my gaze flicking to the studio several feet away. The crowd had long since dispersed, the odd person going in and out of automatic doors.

The security guard was gone, so I made my way back inside. The place was a lot quieter, and I was grateful for that. I headed back through the door, and then down the long corridor, which was empty now. Sure enough, my phone was exactly where I left it.

I grabbed it, and was switching it on, when a cacophony of voices sounded out from behind the door.

Yelling.

“What the fuck is this? What are you doing?”

It was a guy.

“Sir, we’re asking you to stay calm. We’re just following protocol.”

“This is protocol? Let me go! You can’t seriously think this is okay!”

“You signed a contract, did you not?”

“Yeah, for the role! What the fuck is this?”

"Stay calm, young man. We're not going to hurt you."

“No, no, no. I want to go home. I take it back! Do you hear me?”

Curiosity got the better of me. When I peeked through the door, I got a glimpse of a guy around my age with dark red hair.

He was struggling in what looked like a guard's grip, his hands pinned behind his back. The guy seemed to have the upper hand for a moment, headbutting the guard and stumbling back. But his bindings were too tough. Before he could run, the guard's fingers were gripping the back of his sweatshirt and yanking him back. When he twisted around, hissing out, his gaze met mine. It looked like he might yell, his eyes widening, lips curling into a cry. Call the cops. 

He didn't have to say it. 

I nodded at him, my gaze finding a pile of something at the back of the room. Bags, coats and phones. Something cold slithered down my spine. 

Whoever had been accepted or given a role hadn’t left that room. I’d dodged a bullet without even realising it. I pretended not to see Kaz’s bright yellow sweatshirt. I wanted to believe he’d left ages ago with Tandy, and that the two of them were passionately arguing over something trivial someplace in town. By the look of it though, they were also victims.

I grabbed for my phone, but the guard was already pulling the guy out of a fire exit door. When the guy cried out, his yells were muffled. For a moment I was frozen, stiff, petrified to the spot. I don't know why I did what I did. Looking back, it was stupid. But I didn't know what else to do. It was the thought that I was so close to them, that I was capable of stopping them in their tracks. Before I could stop myself I followed them out of the fire exit and back out into the heat. Voices slammed into me, at first muffled, and then getting progressively louder.

The back of the studio was nothing but a parking lot. And in that parking lot, to my surprise, was what looked like a battered school bus. The yellow paint had long since faded, and a window was hanging off. The red-haired guy was dragged onto the bus, and he wasn't the only unwilling passenger. I saw maybe a dozen faces blurred in the sun's haze. Fuck. What was it, some kind of hostage situation?

 I recognised some of them from the crowd of hopefuls. It didn't make sense. Why kidnap a group of college kids trying out for a movie? I ducked behind a wall, pressing myself against it. Calling the cops was out of the question. I’d checked my phone before heading out of the fire escape. 

The bastard had died on 10%. 

I noticed the bus had no driver, and the guard who had been dragging the redhead had disappeared. Which meant there was nobody of authority on or near the bus. In my head, it seemed like the perfect plan. I'd get on the bus, free the dozen or so hostages, and then lead them away. 

Pure adrenaline got me on that bus. I don’t know how—my legs were moving, and then I was running, diving on board. In my panic, I didn’t know what to do. I grabbed a random girl’s bindings, but I needed something to cut through them. It hadn't occurred to me that their ankles were bound too. "Ryan!" Kaz was at the back with a hysterical Tandy. He held up his bound wrists. I noticed he had a black eye, his clothes dishevelled, bruise marks on his neck.  Kaz must have up a fight.  "You have your phone, right? Call the cops!”

"I can't!" I yelled back, fumbling with a guy’s restraints with trembling hands. "My phone's dead!"

The red-head, who was slumped next to a sobbing girl, groaned. "Are you fucking kidding me?"

He twisted around to scowl at me. "Do you have a death wish? Get the fuck out of here!”

His words roared in my skull as I forced my legs to work. I made it to Kaz, but he shook his head when I grabbed his wrists. "You need to get off this bus, right now." He gasped out. "If you get taken too we're screwed.”

I backed away, my hands slipping from his restraints. "Right." I panted.

I took two steps back, then three, before a girl shrieked.

"Someone's coming!"

"Fuck." Kaz gestured behind him, struggling.

"Back seat, Ryan. Hide.”

I had no choice. Dropping to my hands and knees I crawled to the very of back of the bus, squirming under a seat. A woman’s voice sounded, and I recognised it from the audition room. “Is this everyone?”

“Yes, Ma’am.” A man’s gruff voice replied. “Six boy’s and six girls.”

“Wonderful.” She said. “I’ll be following behind in a car. You know what to do.”

When the doors slammed shut behind her retreating footsteps, it hit me that I was stuck. I buried my head in my arms, swallowing a yell. Professor Carlisle had told me to step out of my comfort zone. This was it, right? Was this what he wanted? The bus engines roared to life, and then we were moving. 

A girl started screaming, demanding to know where we were being taken-- but she was ignored. Then... hissing. At first, I thought it was the engines, and I was stupid enough to have hoped the bus was breaking down. But we just picked up speed, and the hissing continued.  With it, came silence. The screams and yelling and crying stopped abruptly.

Even Kaz, who had been whispering reassurances to Tandy, had gone quiet.  

Fear enveloped me and I curled into myself struggling to breathe. Inhale and exhale. So easy, and yet when you’re suffocating under a bus seat in a hostage situation, suddenly it was hard to even gasp out. When the hissing faded, I lifted my head from my arms and blinked rapidly. 

I'd had a clear image of the back of a guy's head from my place huddled under the seat. I was able to see his hair, which was curling at the back of his neck, and a snake tattoo printed on bronze skin, as well as the polka dot pattern on his seat. 

 Now, though, all I could see was... white.

Like looking into a cloud of fog. I was frowning at the fog, trying to figure out if something was burning, if someone had set a fire or the engines had caught alight, when my eyes grew heavy, and every thought was sludgy and wrong, choked in fog. I needed to... I needed to get out, I thought dizzily. But when I tried to force my body out from under the seat, it didn't move the way I wanted it to. Opening my mouth to cry out, I managed a barely distinguishable whimper.

I was aware of my head flopping onto the ground, before oblivion, a feral fear igniting in my gut and following me into the dark, one last thought forcing itself to the forefront of my mind where it stayed. 

“I’ve been gassed.”

I’ve been gassed.

Presently, those words were still in my head.

I could move again, and with a decent semblance of my memories back, I crawled out from under the seat and jumped up. It was pitch black. The lights on the bus flickered, illuminating empty seats in an eerie golden glow.

Everyone was gone.

My gaze flicked to the windows, my stomach curling.

Where though? Where had they been taken?

Slowly, I made my way to the front of the bus. When I opened the doors and stepped out into a downpour, my shoes sank into soaking grass and dirt. In front of me was a large glass building. It looked new like it had been recently built. I glimpsed spiralling modern staircases through opaque windows, shadows dancing through fluorescent light. 

Looking around, I was in the middle of nowhere, nothing but trees and a tall wire fence surrounding the place on both sides. 

Several ideas came to mind, though most of them, I knew would end with me getting caught. The only thing I could do was make it inside and look for a phone, or something that could get help. 

Luckily, there was a surprising lack of security at the doors. I walked through automatic doors straight into an expanse of white, a corridor with clinical white walls and matching ceiling. Underneath my foot, though, there was something sticky and white, a trail of it leading down the hallway.

The place was too clean, too bright, and my shoes were marking perfect marble with dirt and grass from the outside. I made it down the corridor and through a set of doors, and then up a random staircase. My idea was to find a room with a phone and call for help, but I wasn’t expecting every room to be locked with a biometric scanner. My only chance was to wait for someone to open it for me.

 I waited, crouched behind a wall, for what felt like hours, before footsteps.

A man in a starched white lab-coat scanned his thumb, and then leaned forward for a green light to illuminate his face, before the door opened, and he slipped inside. Before it could slam shut, I darted out and grabbed it, following suite. When I stepped over the threshold I was blinded by light, an intense allure blurring my vision. The man was nowhere to be seen, and I stayed pressed against the door, catching my breath. Phone, I thought. I had to find a phone.

Before something tickled the back of my neck, sending my flesh crawling, my nerve-endings igniting.

I thought it was the rain dripping from my hair, but then I felt its body, fat and bulging, crawling under my shirt. Spider. I fucking hated spiders. Slamming my hand over my mouth, I shook my body as hard as I could, attempting to dislodge the bastard.

 It worked. At least, I thought it did. When I dared a look at the ground, I saw the thing, a tiny spider scuttling over marble tiles.

 I couldn’t stop myself from making sure it was gone, even when I’d seen it crawl away. I slapped the back of my neck and ran my fingers under my shirt. When I was sure there were no more spiders on me, or near me, I straightened up, blinking in the warm fluorescent light bathing the room.

It suddenly hit me how warm it was. Uncomfortably warm. There was something in front of me. 

What looked like—glass tanks. They were stacked on top of each other, lining the room. When I pressed my face against one, I caught something moving inside. I thought back to the baby spider I’d shaken off in  a panic. If that was the baby, then I was looking at the mom. Jesus fucking Christ, it was the biggest spider I’d ever seen in my life.

A spider the size of a football was attached to the tank in front of me. It was like nothing I’d ever seen before, a writhing fury thing with visible pincers. It was pure black in colour, a bulging body, and eight twitching legs which looked sharp enough to slice through flesh. It skittered across glass which looked far too thin to keep in whatever the fuck I was looking at. Jumping back, my gaze shot across the room. They were everywhere. The same species of spider in every tank. Looking closer there were tubes and wires connected to each one, threading through each cage. I examined the tubes, poking the plastic.

There was some kind of solution running through them. I noticed a symbol printed on each tank.

One that I recognised.

I mean, everyone knew that symbol.

What I wanted to know, was why was it here? What did these spiders have to do with them?

When footsteps sounded outside, I panicked and jumped behind a pile of boxes at the back of the room.

A woman entered wearing the same lab-coat. In her hand was a syringe. With careful steps, she strode over to the nearest tank and stuck the needle inside the tube, pressing down the plunger.

I watched a clear liquid fill the container. The woman stroked the tank, a smile curving her lips. “Well, aren’t you a beauty.” She whispered, and to my surprise, the spider followed her movements, mimicking her smooth fingers dancing across the glass.

With a smile, like the woman was bidding the spider’s goodbye, she left the room.

I caught the door before it could close fully and followed her. This time she headed all the way down the corridor and burst through double doors leading into a larger room. I stayed outside, glimpsing through a crack in the door.  “Thank you for waiting,” Her voice rang out. In front of her were the others from the bus, still bound and on their hands and knees. None of them were putting up a fight. 

When I caught sight of Tandy, her eyes were half lidded, the spark in her expression which had encompassed her personality, was gone. Her cheeks were pale, her gaze was blank. The woman stepped in front of them and held up the syringe.

 “Now. Shall we begin?”

I spied guards everywhere, standing at each door except the entry way.

So that’s where they all were.

The woman cleared her throat. “Two years ago we led an expedition to Queensland, Australia, to find a mutant spider which had apparently bitten a four year old boy. Now, a little backstory on this particular spider. The Sydney Funnel Spider is the most dangerous arachnid in the world. Its bite can kill you in minutes. So, of course we were pleasantly surprised when the four year old boy did not die. In fact,” She held up the syringe, a grin splitting her mouth apart, “The boy then went on to decapitate his whole family and burn his house to the ground."

She waited for a response. When there was none, her eyes flashed with satisfaction.

“Some say it was rabies. Others, a virus. The case was covered up, of course. If the public found out there would be quite the hysteria,” She chuckled and came to crouch in front of the red-head, who bore the exact same expression as Tandy. All the light had gone from his eyes.

“It was the work of an anonymous individual who, against all odds, had managed to genetically enhance not just the creature itself, but its venom. What started as an experiment to try and find a cure for the Sydney Funnel Spider’s bite turned into a discovery which turned the scientific world upside down. Suddenly we were questioning everything we had ever come to known, all logic and facts gone.” The woman was teasing the plunger, dragging the needle over the flesh of the guy’s neck.

“Do you want to guess what we found?”

It felt like the world had stopped, or something with reality had gone very fucking wrong.

When the woman stabbed the needle into the guy, his eyes lit up, like firecrackers, black vein-like streaks appearing in his face and neck, before he slumped to the ground, a sharp expanse of red pooling beneath him.

“We call it G6.” The woman announced, moving to the next person. A girl with a red ponytail who’s body flopped like a doll when she grabbed the girl’s neck, plunging in the syringe. “When entering the subject’s bloodstream it can either make them or break them. The venom initially resets the brain before stabling, giving the body a choice. Will it accept the venom?” 

The girl writhed in her grasp before hitting the ground, screeching into marble tiles. “Or—will it reject it?” When she came to stand in front of Tandy, I couldn’t breathe. In went the needle, and Tandy hit the ground like the others. Then Kaz. The woman grabbed Tandy’s ponytail and yanked it.

“As you can see, the G6 venom causes some subjects to go feral, some to kill themselves, and some—”

She stopped when an eruption of red splattered her and the others, staining the walls. It took me a dizzying second to realise the explosion of red had been a girl. 

“Some….burst."

Continuing down the line, the woman observed the ones still kneeling.

Kaz coughed up something white, something which sizzled his flesh, dripping down his chin.

It was the same stuff from the hallway.

What I'd stepped in. 

The woman knelt in front of him and reached out, swiping a gloved finger under his chin.

“And some… metamorphosize.”

That’s all I can say for now. I’ll be back in a few days.

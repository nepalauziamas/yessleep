This is something I need to get off my chest. I am a student in.... I both learn and work half time in the school cafeteria. This happened on a Saturday evening while I was doing a catering service from 6-11 pm. Straight to the point, I started doing the work when a message was sent from my group members stating that we have a group discussion after 30 min which I almost forgot about it. I asked my supervisor to let me out and she gave me 30 min break for the discussion. As I was heading out to the library which was the spot were gonna met I got another message saying " change of plan for tomorrow" I was mad about how some students don't respect other people's time. But any ways I wanna take a 20 min break so I went to the lobby under the library because the library always close at 5pm on Saturdays and was the place of nice couches. I set an alarm for 15 min and take a nap. Roughly after 2 minutes I just woke up seeing this arab professor staring at me. He said did I wake u up? I was confused and said "nah ur good" he then asks me what the SS building was and I said just go straight the last building is the SS building. And then I felt something was wrong and want to get back to work. As I was walking the hallway I remembered one of my friend tell me that this professor has been teach for over 9 years and it was surprising for me that he didn't know where the SS building was. Anyways as I start getting close to my work a message was sent to my phone so I decided checking it before I got back to work. At this point I was At least 1 minute away from my work place. I responded to the text and when i see my surrounding I was in SS building. I was shocked to death because i couldn't remember how I got there. So I went to the the bath room in front of me because i taught I was sleep walking and washed my face. After I got out of that bathroom I couldn't be able to know the direction to my work place. I was scared because i use this route for the last three years. I decided to go downstairs and use the door that can get u out of that building and decided to walk in public to my work place . But then I heard a running footsteps. I turned my face and look that creepy professor with knife saying"stop u little prick" I run as fast as I could and get of that building and run to my work place. As soon as I got there, I told my co-workers everything but they ended up telling me I was dreaming. I know that was real but I was forced to accept that I was dreaming. But after 2 weeks I got a note in my locker saying that I was lucky and will get me other time. I was shocked that I was right this whole time.

Thanks

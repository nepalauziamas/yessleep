so for some background and to paint the picture in your head: 20yo stonie who regularly smokes weed and rarely has any issues besides the occasional quick faint. Mind you, I normally smoke papers or hit a dab, my days of white peach games are well behind me. 

I went to my high school friends house while I was in town for the week and we did our usual activity of rolling up and chatting in the back, some pasta cooking inside, all is well. We smoked a grape Game however, just feel like this is important to add. We go back inside and finish up the noodles and I start to feel a little dizzy and choose to sit down because I can usually tell when iâ€™m going to pass out. after I sat and watched her make all the pasta I feel like iâ€™ve gathered myself enough to make my own bowl and come back to my seat. With success, it was in fact bussin. 

However I still feel odd and almost like I have to throw up so I try to nonchalantly go to the bathroom even tho I can kinda feel myself sway. Theres nothing happening in there so I go back to my pasta. 

I finish my bowl slow as ever with my head hanging at this point I know I look like thereâ€™s something wrong at this point but they just cleaned the kitchen top to bottom no dishes at all and I wasnâ€™t about to leave my dang spaghetti bowl to dry and crust up.  So I think I can gather the strength to wash my dish but I have to hold the counter to get to the sink and i do an alright job at washing but I literally canâ€™t stand up straight and my vision is starting to go in and out. 

I turn off the water and try to put my bowl on the counter to dry however this bowl is now 50lbs and I canâ€™t lift it so I just blindly bang it in the sink twice and choose to leave it there cause now I canâ€™t see nor lift and hardly walk but wasnâ€™t going down yet it was like the power was going out in my brain. I found myself on the other side of the counter and kept hearing this banging and my ears were so hot and ringing louder than iâ€™ve ever felt/heard. Opened the eyes that I didnâ€™t know were closed and the banging was actually my head on the counterðŸ™‚ and I looked over to see one scared ass friend who asked if I wanted to lay down. Absolutely I did. I donâ€™t know how I made it to the bed but I just flopped on it and was not able to move I could barely hear the ringing was so loud. 

Then after just chilling for a couple minutes I was fine. like nothing happened. And I just wanna know what coulda cause that like was it the wrap? I wasnâ€™t dehydrated and no it wasnâ€™t the weed because she was fine it was from the dispo. Could it have been something neuro related? scared me. any thoughts would be appreciated:) iâ€™ve passed out after smoking before and it was a tobacco wrap too (too long ago to say which brand) but it really donâ€™t be happening when iâ€™m home literally has only happened when I smoke w said friend. 

i titled it that because the robot w shit batteries is what i looked like when i banged my head on the counter btw

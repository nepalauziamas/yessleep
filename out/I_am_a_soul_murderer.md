Have you ever killed anyone? No, I'm not talking about destroying the other person's physical body. Because this is not a real death. To literally kill a person, you have to destroy their soul.

All humans have a soul, and when they are brain dead, their souls leave their bodies. No one knows where the souls leaving their physical bodies then go. There are perhaps thousands of different religions in the world, and they all say something else about it. Frankly, I don't care where the soul goes. The part I'm interested in is killing my victims without causing them pain or stress and capturing their souls easily and effortlessly. If you frighten your victims during the kill, their souls leave the body very quickly and it becomes impossible to catch them. That's why sudden, unexpected forms of death are usually my first choice. For example, squeezing in the head, poisoning. Sleeping pills are also among my favourites.

Depending on the method you use, the time the soul leaves the body may vary. For example, the soul of someone you spray on the head can leave immediately, while it is not clear when the soul of someone you poison will come out. That's why I use this method when I have plenty of time. I wait patiently with a couple of whiskeys and cigars. If you're killing him in his own home, there are problems with his family suddenly coming in. I don't like going off schedule, but sometimes it's inevitable.

How do I capture the soul? Nice question. I developed this method myself. I have neither seen nor heard of anyone using it other than me. It is necessary to know the height and weight of the victim. It is not difficult to learn this information. Height and face photos of the victim taken from different angles are also required. I then sculpt a detailed sculpture of his victim. This part is difficult and takes some practice and dexterity. After the sculpture is finished, I pour a special adhesive liquid down its head. The entire statue needs to be covered with this liquid. When this liquid dries up, which will dry in a few hours, I remove this plastic skin and seal any remaining gaps. Sometimes if I'm in a hurry, I tape it past. Then I make a small hole in the top of his head with a needle. This is how the victim's skin, in short - the bag - is made.

Before killing your victim, it is necessary to lay this bag on the ground. If it is folded, it becomes difficult for the soul to enter, sometimes they do not even enter at all. I missed a lot of souls like this during my novice years. After the soul leaves the physical body, its first priority will be to try to re-enter its own body, but if you have done your job properly this will not happen and the most similar thing to its own body will go into the bag. For me, it is quite enjoyable to watch the bag fill slowly. He will try to get up from the ground when it is completely inside, he must not allow it and close the gap above his head because when he realizes that he is in the wrong body, it only takes seconds to leave the bag. This is how I capture the souls of my victims.

After capturing the soul, I torture it. Most of my clients don't want this from me, but I can't help myself. It gives me incredible pleasure to feel helpless pain inside a bag that is not even a millimeter thick. It's a scene where you should see him swinging his weak limbs in a panic, trying to walk.

I'll never forget, the moment I tortured someone's soul, his family came home. When his wife and children saw the body, they simultaneously screamed. Interestingly, the spirit recognized his wife and children and tried to move towards them, but was tied to the leg of the chair. I died laughing.

I won't tell you how I destroyed souls because that part is boring. 

Sorry for my bad English.

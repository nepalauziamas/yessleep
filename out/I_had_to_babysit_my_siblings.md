 My siblings were always the annoying type. The type that would bug you until they get the attention they want. One night my parents wanted to go out on a date, so they asked me if I could babysit my siblings I initially disagreed, I never liked my siblings, but my mom offered to get me my favorite fast food on the way back. Finally, I agreed to babysit my siblings; besides, I had to give in eventually, as there was no one else they could call in such a short time. I have a younger brother and a younger sister; they were around eight to nine years old. The first few hours were uneventful until I heard the doorbell ring. I thought it was my parents,s I went to open the door, but then I stopped; they brought a key with them. Why didn't they open the door? I decided to look through the peephole and almost screamed there on our house's porch was a tall skinny figure wearing a top hat and a white mask with a bloodied smile etched into it. I then heard my "mom's" voice "Josh, can you open the door?" My name wasn't Josh it was John. The thing on the other side got impatient and I heard my "Dad's" voice "Josh, you better open this door or I'll kill you!" I turned and ran to my siblings' room and locked it. 

"Is mommy home?" asked my little sister

"No, she isn't home," I said

"Stop lying!" Snapped my little brother

My little brother got up and stormed to the bedroom door and unlocked it. I urged him not to unlock the front door, but he didn't listen. He stormed downstairs and opened the door. There was silence for a moment before I heard a deafening scream. I ran downstairs and I saw the thing reaching for my brother. I grabbed him and ran back into my siblings' room and locked the door behind us.

"What happened? Is mommy home?" asked my little sister

"No!" yelled my brother and I

"It's the exact opposite," said my brother

We heard a demonic voice singing nursery rhymes before stopping at our door. We held our breath before it began to bang on our door. My sister screamed as the banging continued. Eventually, the banging stopped I grabbed my brother's bat and slowly opened the door. I saw nothing out of the ordinary so I slowly walked through my house I found nothing. I decided to call my parents, but I heard screaming coming from my siblings' room. I ran up the stairs and saw the thing looming over my crying siblings I raised my bat and hit the creature. It turned to look at me and I saw its creepy mask close up. It pointed at me and said, "No one can save you now." I raised my bat to hit it again, but it caught it. 

"I'll cut you a deal," it said

"What do you mean by that?" I said

"I will take them off your hands if you..." it said

"If I what?" I said

"If you give me your liver," it said

I didn't know what to do. I would lose either way. It began to walk towards me, but then it stopped. I turned around to see my neighbor holding up a bible. It stepped back, opened the window, and leaped through it. 

"Thank you!" I said

"No problem," replied my neighbor

"Say, how did you know it was in here?" I asked

"Well I saw it enter your house," said my neighbor

My neighbor offered to stay with me until my parents arrived. I told them everything, but of course, they didn't believe me. I had never had anything like that happen again. As I am writing this I heard a knock on my door I ordered pizza they came earlier than I expected.

I always dreamt of living in a small cottage in the forest, and that was only a dream until recently. I felt like I belonged to the mysterious nature of the forest. Everything in it felt like it called to me, and this opportunity was perfect for me.


The cottage was built years ago by a man who eventually went insane. No one knew what happened to him, but it sold for an extremely low price, so it was my only chance to live in the forest.


It's located in the middle of the forest, yet I'm still able to drive to my job due to all the roads connecting to it.


The trees around it are alluring, the way the surroundings look whenever it rains is dazzling, and the wildlife is active, so I often spend hours just walking around, staring at the beauty. It was honestly the best purchase of my life.


But, as soon as I stepped into my newly owned home, an esoteric aura rushed into my body, almost like I knew that something would happen to me. I'm not sure why, but I shrugged it off as something normal. I even embraced it as it was a part of why I moved here.


The first night wasn't normal. I slept late due to how much moving and organising I had to do. I awoke suddenly at around 4 A.M. and felt like daggers were shooting through the eyes of something staring at me. I looked around, yet nothing was near my general area. I thought it was normal. First nights alone always feel eerie. I tried to sleep it out, but the daggers pierced through my skin so hard I couldn't close my eyelids. I had to go to work with only 3 hours of sleep.


The shift felt long and weary; my eyelids were pulled by invisible hooks that had 20 tonnes of weights attached to them. I had never been this unproductive. All the papers were as if someone had scribbled on them, and my hands felt like there was an earthquake going on inside of them.


I headed back home after I finished work. I was too exhausted to do anything else other than that. It felt like with every blink I was going to collapse. I couldn't drive in this state, so I had to call a taxi home. I dozed off and slept without realizing it.


As soon as I entered my home, I simultaneously fell asleep as I was changing. Hours passed while I slumbered, until I was interrupted again by that weird sense of being watched. I look at the clock.


"4:39 A.M." Same as yesterday.


I shuffled around my dim house trying to find any signs of an intruder, yet I found nothing more than the dirt I dragged inside my house with my shoes during my state of fatigue.


I peered through my window, staring at the moonlit surroundings, but I was only able to make out animal footprints. Some were big, some small, some spread apart, some tightly packed, though there was one connection between them, and that was that they were all leading up to my window. I wasn't sure what to think of it. It couldn't be curiousity. That's one thing I'm sure of. It isn't new by any means.


 I didn't feel tired. I had gotten many hours of sleep. Amidst all the uneasiness I felt, I decided to ignore it and embrace the cool breeze of the early morning, trying to take back the misery of yesterday and make today better.


I headed into work feeling more energetic than I usually am. Because of that, I was also more productive.


I clocked out of my shift and immediately went to the furniture store to get some blinds to help with the feeling of being stalked. Apparently, you do feel when you're being watched, so I thought this would help ease me.


After I set up my blinds, I went on with my day and finally was able to go to sleep at my normal time. For once, I was actually able to experience the beauty of my home comfortably.


For the third night in a row, I woke up with an uneasy feeling once again, but this time it was earlier by 3 minutes.


"4:36 A.M."


I peeked through my blinds first. Nothing, not even those same tracks from yesterday.


Although I knew it was futile, I checked the other rooms in my home second. Nothing stood in the shadows of those empty rooms other than my furniture.


I decided to head back to bed, hoping that I'd be able to shake off this feeling, but as soon as I pulled the blanket over me, the sense surged through my body. I became tense. I checked the clock again.


"4:37 A.M."


I opened my blinds and shrieked.


All the animals, all of them were staring at me through my window. The deer's dark, empty eyes focused on me; the owls' twisted neck judging me; the bats' upside-down position mocking me; all of them plotting something against me.


I sat down in shock. I like the weird nature of the forest, but this just felt different, like I was in danger.


I had never felt this terrified before, but just as fast as it came, it went.


"4:38 A.M."


The uneasiness wore off slowly, and after another minute, it felt like the same strength as the past two nights. It certainly was weaker, but I couldn't stop thinking about it.


 I tried to feel normal, but part of me doesn't want to. I wasn't sure what to do.


I thought about it more and more, and it clicked in my mind that that's why I'd been waking up randomly at 4:39 A.M.; I was being watched by these creatures.


I decided to take the day off. I wouldn't get enough sleep to be useful, and my mind would just concentrate on that dark moment.


I met up with a friend, Sarah, for some coffee. I hadn't talked to her in a while, and I needed some actual interaction with people to take it off my mind. After we finished up, she mentioned how she still hadn't visited my new house and how she always wanted to spend at least a night in one. I tried my hardest to convince her not to, but she wouldn't budge.


Honestly, I was glad she came over; it distracted me from what had happened, and I really enjoyed it. We talked for hours upon hours and didn't notice the time passing by; it had already become midnight! We both prepared to sleep while listening to the rain patter.


For the first time in what felt like forever, I actually got a good night's sleep. No disturbance or feelings of being watched, just nothing, absolutely nothing other than the gentle taps on the window by the rain. I woke up feeling wonderful. However, my morning would turn gruesome once I turned over.


I jumped in horror as I saw Sarah. Her clear skin was smudged by blood, her baby blue eyes were blocked out, her whole body was disfigured. I don't know how I didn't hear it, but those creatures broke in and trampled her.


It had been too late to save her. It was 10:49 in the morning, hours after the animals would've come. I called the cops to help with the situation, but they wouldn't believe me and I was temporarily held as a suspect. I was released due to the autopsy revealing that it was just an animal attack.


When I returned to my disheveled home, I didn't realise how bad it was due to how sudden everything was.


After a long and exhausting cleaning session, I went to sleep again. I woke up to the same exact thing, same exact time, an occurrence that kept happening to me for the next week.


Eventually, Sarah's funeral was held. It wasn't an easy thing to attend to, knowing it was my fault. If I just convinced her not to visit, she'd still be alive and happy right here.


I let everything out once I went back home. My mental health had been deteriorating, I never got enough sleep, and I caused my friend to die, all because of these stupid animals.


In my fit of rage, I threw a book on the wooden tiles, and one of them opened, revealing a secret compartment containing a journal by the man who used to live here.


 I read through it all. He was going through the exact same thing as me. He woke up randomly to see animals staring at him. They even killed someone who was close to him. As I read through it more, I noticed his descent into madness. He kept talking about how he doesn't feel like he has control of his own body, and how some days he just blacks out and has no memories of them. Everyone says he acts completely different on some days, as if something else took control of his body.


After finishing it, I started visiting a therapist, just so I wouldn't fall into the same hole, but it was to no avail. Everyone I tried telling this to didn't believe me, which made everything worse. My co-workers have been commenting on how it's like I've gone insane. all while I was still being stalked by animals.


Eventually, I started to black out for full days, not recalling anything about it. My friends, co-workers, and everybody else talked about how different I was on some days, yet I have no memories of them.


 When I was actually conscious, I bought a video camera and placed it outside my bedroom to see what was happening.


I checked them after one of my blackouts, and every time at 4:37 a.m., the animals would appear, but one of them would vanish and all the others would flee, and I would awaken.


Except it isn't me that actually wakes up. The animal, it doesn't disappear, it instead takes over my body and plays as me for a day. And for every day I blacked out, the day before it, my sanity would be at a low.


I've been blacking out for multiple days at a time now. My sanity is quickly seeping away, and everyone is making it much worse.


I don't know what to do, and I'm not sure how much longer I'll have control of my body.

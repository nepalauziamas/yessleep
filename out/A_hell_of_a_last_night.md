whenever me and my friends snuck out at night at we would see  and hear some things i dont think we should've. So for some background information i used to live ( not anymore on the other side of the country) in a part of colorado where there most likely was native american presence during the western expansion/trail of tears era at least thats what a figure because of a native american reference from a school and what a history teacher told us ( all though i never fully looked into it ) . When me or really any friends of mine went outside past a certain time you almost always saw things. And things is the only way to describe it because they werent always people per say a better word would be beings if that makes sense

&#x200B;

So the way the area worked it there was my apartment complex and then the townhouses neighborhood next to mine. My apartment complex was built on a hill so at the left edge of my complex was a road and on the right side there was a fence that was the border of my neighborhood and the townhouses. if you wanted to go to the townhouse you could either walk up the hill and along the street or you could go down the hill and walk towards them. at the bottom of the hill there was a walking path that went about 1 mile in each direction ( give or take ) if you went left go to 711 and a small strip mall area. 

&#x200B;

To the right was  the townhouses and when you got further down the trail on the right it was a horse stable after you got past the horse stable for the most part it was mostly dryish feilds. And running through everything that was parralle to the path was a creek some of it was man made such as the parts were it was concrete instead of mud/dirt. Once you got further into the path there was more bushing closer to the creek especially like trees,tall grass, and dry bushes. 

&#x200B;

 there wasnt light on the path past the horse stable nothing for about 1000 feet. Especially at night it always felt like something was watching you not just someone because if you know what it feels like there is a distinct differences between someone meaning a person watching you feeling, and a something feeling almost as if you are being looked at as pray.

It was the morning of the day i was supposed to move away with my family to a new state at this point it is about 230-3 in the morning so me and my friends are walking around on the path knowing that there is in our terms " weird shit " here but we didnt really care because well we were being dumb kids and i am moving in a few hours so it was like a final hoorah we were talking laughing and listening to music after a while we sit down in the middle of the sidewalk about 50 or so feet off from bushes and trees now it wasnt very heavily bushed close to the path but if you went in a little ways no one would be able to see you unless they came looking plus it is night time. 

&#x200B;

So me and my two friends ill call m and j walk about 50 feet into the bushes and hide behind a bush. We are not seen and M tells me and J " lets make our other friends think we lost (me) OP" so we both agree and M starts yelling stuff like " OP AND J WHERE DID YOU GO!?" " I LOST OP AND J" after about 5 minutes of that M tells me and J stay put and to come out whenever is a good time im with about another 4 people that are looking for me and do not know where i went. its just me and J sitting alone in a bush whispering

&#x200B;

after about 10 minutes of the other 4 trying to call me i tell J " go back to them and tell them you were following me and then you didnt see me anymore you came back" J quietly got out of the bush and went running the about 50 feet to the rest of the group and i heard J say what i told them to. after about 5 minutes of the rest of them calling me it sounds like they start to come looking for me so i put my hood over my head and hide into a little ball. I hear them start to look for me because i hear muffled talking noises and footsteps when the footstep got closer to me the talking noise would always stop and the footsteps wouldnt come within 10 feet of me.

&#x200B;

 after about 10 minutes of those noises they start to get further away and stop and i see i have a snap from J from 5 minutes ago but i didnt open it i jus texted M and he was saying that they actually think i got lost for like 5 minutes after noise stopped i was just sitting there waiting for the go ahead to come out from M when i heard it again so i hide my phone and then went back into a ball position but it sounded close so i get up and thinking i was found stand up and about 20 feet ahead of me in between bushes i saw a figure almost similar to M tall skinny slouched over kinda but i had a strange gut feeling that told me it wasnt M along with that feeling all the hair on my body stood up and when the moon came out from behind a cloud and illuminated this figure it was not M because M had poofy curly hair a messy Afro that wasnt all one mass of hair this being had what appeared to be little deer antlers ( saying little because they didnt appear fully grow) and was standing on two legs.

&#x200B;

i have heard about things like this before never did i think that i would come with such a close proximity of one though as quietly as i could i stepped away from where it could see me and ran as fast as i ever have in my life down this trail looking for my friends who have seem to left. I look back once and i just hear the weirdest noise i have heard it like a strange it was like a woman screaming but it didnt sound human after sprinting 1000 or so feet back to the horse stable. I called my friend M to see where they were while i was still walking at a fast ass pace. He said they are at a bench that we all know the location of.

&#x200B;

 When i get there and start talking about what happened and why they left i open my phone and open that snap that J sent me about 5 minutes i thought i heard them start to look for me and its them sitting at that exact spot we are sitting at now and the rest of my 6 friends are in the picture. Meaning they couldnt have been the ones i heard getting close to me. and just to be sure they didnt go there and come back they said they all left after J came out because they figured i was pulling something so id just call when i was done messing around. 

&#x200B;

one of the people i was with H even had videos from around the time i was hearing the nosies  that showed them to not have moved from that spot. Now im sitting there thinking about three things. 1, this is one hell of a last night with my friends, 2, what would've happened to me if i had moved when i heard the footstep that close to me and 3 was i being stalked by the same thing or was there more then one.

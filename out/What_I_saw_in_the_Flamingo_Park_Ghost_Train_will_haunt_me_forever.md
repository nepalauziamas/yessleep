Have you ever been on a ghost train? I don’t mean those industrial movie-themed rides. I mean those traditional fairground rides that are usually built into black boat houses. If your answer is yes, then you will know just how cheap and nasty some of those things can be. For me, I always felt a wave of nostalgia wash over me whenever I rode one.

A little backstory...

My name is Edward, I am twenty-two, and I have been going all over the U.K searching for small nostalgic thrills, and yes, said thrills are in the form of childish rides, fairground arcades, and wacky fun houses. All of this changed however when I rode the Ghost Train at Flamingo Park, Hastings, England.

When I arrived, I had a route set in my mind. First, I was going to ride the dodgems, then explore the green jungle maze, and finally finish off with the Ghost Train.

After I ticked off all of the activities on my imaginary bucket list, I approached the old, decrepit jet-black building that housed the Ghost Train. The place felt even more daunting up close; the smell of old wood and the chipped paintwork on the exterior set off a wave of nostalgia.

I deposited three ride tokens (three per person) to the man operating the ride. The first thing I was greeted with were the two uneven wooden doors in front of the cart. Painted on the doors was a face split in two. On one of the doors, the face was all skull and bone. On the other, it was covered in skin and muscle, and hanging down was a blood-soaked sheet reading, “Help us!” I had to admit, it looked pretty graphic, especially for a ride aimed at children.

Next, I was greeted by the male worker who gave me a cliché safety briefing. "Stay in the cart, keeping your hands, arms, feet, and legs inside at all times." After that, I was pushed into the pitch-black darkness beyond the two wooden doors.

When I say the cart moved slowly, I mean slowly! Slower than any other Ghost Train I had ever been on. The first thing that caught my attention was how child-friendly the first room was. The whole room was covered in green, red, and yellow UV paint with a buzzing UV light beaming from the ceiling overhead. I could see a creepy looking skeleton and a few ghosts painted on the far wall.

After a short while, my cart made its way into the second room; this room was slightly more graphic. Directly in front of my cart was a realistic looking prisoner in an electric chair. He convulsed and threw himself back and forth whilst making muffled pleading noises. This was unsettling, but still a good effort for a small, low-budget ghost train.

The third room is where things started to get … weird. In this room, a clown pressed itself up against a metal gate whilst an animatronic lifted its head out of the socket; what was weird, were the random dolls scattered all over the floor.

The fourth room was the one I will never forget, purely because it was the room I got stuck in. The ride itself was pretty dark, so I was tempted to pull out my phone for some light, but that’s when I heard it. I don’t know if it was just my mind playing tricks on me, but I could hear a faint whimpering sound. It sounded like crying, and I assumed it was a passenger in another cart either in front or behind me. Apart from the distant whimpering, the room was deathly quiet.

Suddenly, the crying changed and turned into a deep, raspy laugh. The laughing was low, too low to be a person. I thought that it must have been a HiFi speaker system, and deep down I was praying to myself that it was.

The laughing then ceased, and my cart slowly started to move again. The only odd thing about this room was that it seemed to go on interminably. No props, no lights … nothing. The only audible sound at this point were the cart's wheels rumbling across the floor. It took me a little while to notice, but I realised that something else was wrong. My cart wasn’t moving by itself. It was being pushed! I only realised when I heard heavy breathing other than my own directly behind me.

What followed next was something I will never forget. The cart suddenly stopped, as did the breathing behind me. Taking its place, were the sounds of light footsteps circling around the cart. I wanted to pull out my phone there and then for some light, but I was paralysed with fear. I suddenly felt someone get into the cart with me, and their face felt like it was merely inches away from my own; not only that, but I could distinctly feel a warm breath on my neck. I don’t know what it was, but something caused me to regain conscious movement. I shoved my hand into my left trouser pocket, fumbled around for my phone, and pulled it out without any hesitation. I turned on the phone's torch and shined it in front of me. There was nothing. Just a track that seemed to go into an endless void.

I shined the phone to where the breathing was coming from, and I froze. The face that was merely inches away from my own was absolutely terrifying! It was a woman of average height. Her body was deathly thin with a dirty peach-coloured gown over it. Her wavy-brown hair hung in clumps down either side, but her face is what still haunts me to this day. It was hollow. Her whole face was like one big mouth. No eyes, no nose, and no ears. I practically dropped my phone when I saw a dark red liquid begin to pool on the inside of her face. The thick liquid oozed down either side, and I could feel myself on the verge of vomiting. Still holding my phone, I looked down with the beaming light and saw that her hand was delicately placed on my right leg. Her fingers were all wrong. Where her thumb should have been was as an index finger, and where her middle finger should have been was a thumb. None of her fingers appeared to be in the right place.

I looked back up and gasped as her face was now a mere inch away from my own. I thrashed around violently, screaming until eventually … I passed out.

The next thing I knew, I was outside with paramedics above me. Ride workers, parents, and children all stood around me passing strange looks at each other. I felt slightly embarrassed, but after what I had just seen, I couldn’t do anything. Apparently, the cart I was in had derailed, and the man operating the ride heard me shouting; he came in to find me curled up on the floor next to my cart.

I was rushed to a hospital later on that day. After a few hours, they didn’t find any issues regarding my physical health, so needless to say, I was sent home.

It has been years since this happened. I was always scared to tell people, fearing they might call me crazy. I would have agreed with the notion that I was crazy, had it not been for the fact that I found dark red stains on my clothes the following day.

Hey all, I’m still alive. I know it’s been a couple of days, but we had to keep moving. Probably fruitless in the end but hey, will to survive, you know?

I know I left you all hanging a bit but suffice it to say I can still only get out so much before they can pinpoint where we’re at. I swear to fill you in more as we’re able to do so. I know this all makes me sound like a madman, so you should start from my first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xd8ui1/ive_been_on_a_road_trip_this_summer_and_had_an/).

I blinked again in a fruitless attempt to mentally process the strange young woman’s revelation. I was doing that a lot recently, trying to force my psyche to accept new and sudden unexpected realities as they revealed themselves in rapid succession.

However my old coping mechanisms were simply unable to overcome this latest one, and as the mysterious leather-jacketed woman returned to her usual smirk and lit another smoke I could only shake my jaded head in response to her words.

“Wh…come again? I’m *where*?”

She took another deep drag.

“You’re standing in the lot of the premiere convenience station in all of Lightsville, Pennsylvania,” she said with no shortage of dramatics.

“It’s also the *only* gas station, but please never say that little fact to Old Redd for your own good.”

My head was still shaking, no use trying to stop it now, much less trying to figure out more of this strange woman’s riddle speak.

“No, heh, no I’m definitely in Kentucky…think I was by the Green River, and uh, those caves?”

Now she was shaking her cropped violet hair and pointed up and behind me a bit. I dutifully followed her finger, doing a ‘180 to see a grand and tired looking ‘WELCOME TO LIGHTSVILLE, PA! HOME OF THE FAMOUS SKY-LIGHTS’ sign staring me right in the face.

Well, shit.

“The name has changed a few times,” the young woman said. “Various mayors either trying to preserve the legacy or totally abandon it. But yeah man, you’re in my little neck of the woods now, pun intended.”

I turned back from staring at the leather-clad woman and the proud town sign, back and forth trying my damndest to force my brain to accept the unacceptable.

“Huh. Yeah, I’d definitely say you’re pretty far off the beam there, man. What the shit *happened* to you?” she asked.

I guess I must have looked as jacked up as I felt.

That unnatural exhaustion was setting in strong now, and all I really wanted to do then was collapse and sleep for two days. In fact, that was exactly what my body did, and my knees gave out in full as I slumped against my car. The coolness of the painted steel did some good in bringing me back as the woman crouched next to me, somewhat (and understandably) wary of the strange, mud-covered guy raving how he teleported three states over.

“Hey, woah! It’s okay man, damn, I was just messing! I mean not about being in Penn, but…here, c’mon with me, you need some coffee and a doughnut, and Old Redd has the best of both,” she said, finally breaking her persona.

At least she had a heart, it seemed.

The woman hooked one of her jacketed arms under mine, and with her help and knees that were far too wobbly for my twenty-nine-year-old self, I managed to raise my ass from the pavement into the thick misty air.

*Wait, it wasn’t this foggy a second ago* I thought, right before the worst possible damn thing that could have happened, happened.

The whispers were returning. Instantly I felt that dread return and begin swirling within my guts once more. Even though right then I could not recall exactly what had just happened, I knew from some instinctual, primal level that whatever had attacked and somehow displaced me a few hundred miles was still hunting me.

“We gotta…go, got to get inside, in there, “ I muttered, motioning weakly at the c-store.

Even in that current state, I noticed the woman’s cosmic eyes dart around us.

“You hear them too,” I said more than asked.

Any relief I had found at that validation was short-lived by the growing noise and vibrations. Shuffling my heavy feet towards the sliding doors, my determined form drug the girl forward with me. Exhibiting a strength I would not have guessed by her lithe frame, she kept us upright as we made for the store.

In those dark hours of the deepest part of the night, we had only the dimming lights of the gas pumps to show us the way. At least, right until our entire world lit up brighter than a hospital waiting room. I was temporarily blinded once more by the sudden glare, and in my fear of what I knew was around me yet could not see, I ended up stumbling away from my unlikely savior.

That glaring luminescence had returned in all of its terrifying glory with its cosmic medley of colors, but instead of pulling me gently through the air, this time I was yanked with such violence that I could physically *feel* the rage of whatever was trying to take me.

That horrendous bellow then made an abrupt return to complete the unholy trifecta before I felt a pair of strong hands grasping my ankles, tugging me inch by inch in the opposite direction. My body was crying out in pain, and I’m pretty sure I was screaming right along with it.

“*Fucking shit*! They’ve never done this before!” the young woman yelled.

By some small miracle we were already halfway through the doors, and as soon as we were through we collapsed in a tangled heap on the tiled floor. As the doors swung shut, both the airy whispers as well as that titanic noise only grew in intensity as the coruscant attempted to sneak its way in.

The doors were rattling, straining at their hinges and sharp cracks began to split the ceiling apart as the pair of us huddled in desperation behind the counter. I had not prayed in months, maybe years, yet being in that foxhole stirred me to beg for whatever salvation could be given to my pathetic self.

Perhaps I got an answer, unexpected as it was.

Right before it seemed what little protection the gas station offered was going to give way to the horrors above us, from somewhere in the back rooms of the building came charging a silver-haired and plaid-shirted geezer cradling a genuine M20 Bazooka.

On the older man’s head sat a proud but worn black cap. Stitched on it was a green-bereted demon head with the letters “S.O.G” above it, all surrounded by bolts of yellow and red lightning. His knotted arms still displayed an obvious powerfulness to them, and his face wore a determined look that I had only ever seen in other soldiers.

The only reason I even looked over the counter and saw him through all of the unfolding chaos was that the girl had begun yelling out to him.

“What the *hell* are you doing?!” she screamed in terror, “You’re gonna get yourself killed, you stupid old man!”

He gave her a look that all but said *you ain’t my mama*, and directed his attention to me.

“You there, son! Grab the door for me, I gotta aim this ol’ bitch!” he roared with some hoarseness born of years of smoke inhalation.

I moved by pure instinct then, something within me breaking to the point where the dread was pushed down for the first time as I rushed to obey his order. Actively fighting against the g-force tremors induced by *whatever* this thing was I shielded my eyes as best as I could with one hand, and yanked the door open.

The combined force of my desperate pull and the destructive strength of the tremors synced up in unfortunate timing, sending me crashing back down as the door was ripped halfway from its rusted steel hinges. My head smacked against the kiosk where I was previously taking cover, the impact stirring me from my fugue.

I started to get to my feet, but it was in that brief clarity that I realized this crazy old fuck was about to fire off a rocket in the middle of a freaking gas station, and as he pushed himself outside taking aim skyward directly at the light show, I threw myself back down to the floor.

He called out what I’m sure was “clear backblast!” though with the throbbing noise still raging through the night I could not be sure. Another burst was added to the lurid concoction as the self-propelled rocket shot upwards.

I could only look on in absolute wonderment as it detonated against something that had up until now been obscured from sight, though when the ordinance did its violent duty I saw it clear as the unearthly light emanating from it.

It was a mountainous, void-black sphere that sat within a larger, thinner circle of the same color and apparent material. The two pieces of whatever this unearthly craft was were connected by a series of jagged arms, all of which were the same preternatural dark.

In fact, aside from that odd jagged pattern of connecting arms, the huge craft looked quite similar to those vague descriptions of unidentified saucers that hundreds of people around the country claim to have seen each year.

For a brief second, we all appeared to be in some sort of standoff, the two of us lowly humans confronted with something alien and utterly foreign that was smashing our earthly sensibilities.

Well, at least that was *my* experience of this part of the ordeal. Redd was apparently built differently than the rest of us because he hadn’t stopped screaming obscenities and curses at the alien object since firing the bazooka.

The old man had just begun to reload the launcher with a spare rocket slung over his shoulder when in the blink of an eye, the lights, tremors, and noises all dissipated right along with that skyborne colossus.

In that same instant, all of the peace and tranquility returned to the area just as it had been when I first found myself standing in this lot not twenty minutes prior. However, the aftermath of the event was clear; the splits I had seen forming in the ceiling within the c-store translated to its exterior, with deep cracks running from the roof through the brick walls.

Trash cans and the like were overturned outside, likely from the quaking. With the dissipation of that dreadful noise, I also noticed that the few cars in the immediate area – including mine – had all of their windows shattered and alarms blaring.

To say I was overwhelmed by all of this would be an understatement. Thankfully, things were about to become clearer. Not that that would turn out to be any more comforting.

The old veteran, who I had correctly assumed to be the same “Old Redd” the young woman had been talking about, turned with the coolness that only experience could bring and motioned me back indoors.

“You handled yourself well back there, son,” he said with a newfound warmness.

I shook my head as we moved past the busted-up door and trashed shelves, kneeling wordlessly to help the young woman to her feet. To her credit, she sprang back up without my help and was at least appearance-wise recovering far more quickly than I. Although, something she had said before made me think that this was not quite their first encounter with *that*.

“F…what the hell?? What even…” I stammered out. I didn’t even know where to start.

“Let’s start simple. I’m Redd, that there’s Dahlia. She helps me out here, and apparently strange men who are being hunted by the Hyperboreans!” the older man said with a cracked grin.

*How the fuck is he so…laissez-faire about all of this*? I thought to myself.

“Wait a minute, hold on. The Hyper-who-eans?”

“And they’ve never been so violent before! You must have really pissed them off dude, we’ve been keeping watch here for years now and haven’t come across a survivor yet!” Dahlia exclaimed.

The previous terror I had seen washed across her when we were huddled behind the kiosk counter was gone, replaced by the same fervent expression the old man wore.

“*Survivor*? I mean obviously we were in mortal fucking peril, but how am I the only…hold on, how did you get a damn bazooka? *Why* do you have a damn bazooka?!” I blurted.

The young woman that I now knew as Dahlia took my hand and looked intently into my eyes with her own brilliant multicolored ones.

“I know man, I know it’s a whole lot. It was overwhelming for me at first too, but we’ll explain everything,” she said, her zeal giving way to genuine concern.

Old Redd thumbed on an ancient-looking radio to some blues rock station, the music immediately doing its work of bringing me back down to Earth. At the same time, he went and dragged a few fold-out chairs from behind the kiosk and sat, motioning for us to do the same.

“Trust me, son, you are absolutely going to want to sit down for this [one](https://www.reddit.com/r/GrimTalesMidwest/).”

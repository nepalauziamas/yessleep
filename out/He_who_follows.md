My life had been the same old thing since i moved here 3 and a half years ago. I got a roommate, made friends, occasionally a hookup or two, went out and partied once a month, the whole thing.

I left my family a few states away to start my new life. I love every bit of living here, although my boss isnt the kindest i still make due with everything else. Everyone was so kind and caring, i suppose the only sour one was my boss but i never cared for him. Hardly ever saw him around the office anyways. But this isnt about him, its about me and how it all happened.

I used to hear scary stories about living next to abandoned houses and them being haunted, but it never bothered me more than a few goosebumps or a little shiver down my spine. So i obviously didnt mind moving next to one 3 and a half years ago.

I hated how my bedroom window was facing one of the many rooms in that haunted house. My roommate already lived there and i just moved in the spare bedroom if anyone was wondering. 

She often told me how she saw things in there. like when lightning struck she saw a figure in one of the windows. terrifying. absolutely terrifying.

So i kept curtains covering that window after one time where i saw what she had been talking about. I screeched when i saw it. or did i stand there like a deer in headlights? i dont quite remember. everything is becoming a blur now. i might be losing it a bit… haa . . . back to the story

a few weeks ago i had noticed someone had been following me home.. i never had this happen before so i didnt quite know what to do but i went in a square to make sure i knew i wasnt crazy. 

he was still a bit behind me.

i tried to stay calm and walked into a direction of a well populated area. when i was just around there i walked into one of the many gastations and looked around for a minute and grabbed a random candy. it didnt matter what i grabbed then. i walk up to the register to pay for it i lean a bit over. i whisper, my words quicked and panicked,

“please help me, im being followed”

he then looks on the cameras next to him and then back at the candy and says grumpily,

“that will be 1.99 ma’am”

i look at him shocked and hurt that he would really just let me probably die like that. but before i can say anything or think anything else he says in a hushed tone

“you can go into the bathroom until closing and ill drop you off at home safely”

a rush of relief washes over me as i take the candy to switch it out for one i would actually like to munch on while waiting. he says again 

“thatll be 1.99”

i hand him a $2 bill and as he hands me a penny as change i chuckle and ask in a hushed tone,

“how long until closing?”

he replies a grumpy “30 minutes”

i wait in the bathroom in silence until i hear the cashier eventually tell the guy who was following me to leave and that theyre closing. after another minute of waiting i hear a knock on the door and him telling me its time to go.

i rush out and we make small talk as were going to my home. i repeatedly thank him as im stepping out. i make my way to the door and unlock as i wave a final goodbye.

this one person has been following me around and that time being the first of many. 

A couple nights ago i went clubbing with my roommate and 2 of my friends. we drank, ate, danced, one of us had a hookup in one of the back rooms. i finally felt happy since the first stalking.

after a while i decided to go home early because i felt nauseous but not enough to throw up. i tell them that im going and they try to give me money for a uber/taxi and i declined saying i have enough. 

i did not have enough. 

all i had was a single dollar. “im really dead this time” i thought to myself as a i stumbled home. this wasnt the type of nausea i would sometimes get with drinking. 

this was different. 

i had realized i had been drugged halfway home and it was too late to turn back now. at this point i was really hating myself. life was really starting to suck.

i couldnt take it anymore. i threw up in a random bush i saw. definitely wasnt my best moment. but not my lowest. i noticed someone in the distance.

fed up with this bullshit and in my drunken state i yelled,

“WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR HUH? COME GET ME LIKE A MAN!”

i heard a soft laugh as i started to slowly lose consciousness. he walked closer and closer until he was only a few feet away. i had no idea who the fuck this bitch was but was over it all already.

i spat in his face and yelled a bit more,

“if youre so manly why dont you just take me already instead of taking your sweet ass time. making me paranoid and for what?” 

i pointed at all of him and continued,

“a bitch boy who is skinny and scrawny”

my eyes lost focus as i saw he was about to hit me but i was already falling into the slumber he wanted me to be in. i could never tell if he was either going to slap or punch me.

i guess it doesnt matter if youre basically dead. when i woken up my hand was chained to the wall. i looked around me but it was too dark for me to see anything. i was beaten a lot and was in pain all over.

what did this bastard want?

thoughts flooded my mind of how i could escape. i was to weak to do anything though. he eventually came down and talk to me like weve known eachother for years. he never told me why he did this no matter how many times i had asked.

after a while of me asking question after question he soon got annoyed. whipping out a large knife he stabbed me in my stomach and tossed my phone over. and just said 1 final word to me,

“goodbye”

i was shocked and in pain i had never felt before but before i could think or say any final words he stormed out. 

and that leaves me here quickly typing this because nobody else is picking up.. i hope theyre okay. i know i wont make it out alive but i suppose with my party life i knew something would happen. or i would just happen to have sex with the wrong person.

it doesnt matter but i never even got his name. im dying by an unknown bastard. i cant blame myself too much since im dying. 

i hope my dog is going to be okay. i hope someone takes care of her while im gone. she doesn’t deserve to die right after me. she is only 8 months old. heres my final words because i can feel my life slipping quickly now..

i cant even think of any not even now.. thats really sad. 

fuck. 

i really am going to die here. 

what the fuck is that..

NO PLEASE OH FUCK NOOOO

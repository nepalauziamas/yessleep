Sorry for any typos, English isn't my first language but I just needed other people to hear this out.

So I live in a pretty medium sized city surrounded by desert  in a relatively quiet neighborhood on the outskirts, where everyone just minds their own business.

I like walking at night, especially when it's got a cold breeze,it just brings me peace of mind and helps me to think straight.
This has been going on for a few years, the first time happened it was around 12am, I was walking from my home to a store that's near me, the streets were clear everyone were at their houses, when I heard it the first time.
Loud and I mean LOUD mechanical noises like gears shifting and some clanking and not in my head kind of noises it seemed distant, I couldn't pinpoint exactly where it was coming, so I started to walk faster while covering my ears, the noise started to fade out seconds later and by the time I reached the shop it was gone.

I asked the shopkeeper if he had any idea what that noise was and he just stared at me asking what the hell am I talking about.
apparently he didn't hear anything at that time so I grabbed what I came for and walked home.
I asked my friends who live near me if they heard anything of the liking but none of them did.

Fast forward a couple of months later, I was walking back home from a friend's house when the noise started again but not as loudly as the first time, I saw some of my neighbors were talking when I approached them asking if they can hear this loud noise and they just gave me a blank look and by the time I finished describing it the noise was gone.
So I ran to my house and got my bike and started biking around the neighborhood hoping to find a large construction vehicle or anything to explain what I'm hearing, but to no avail.
Years pass by and I still hear it sometimes when I'm walking other times when I'm at home between 10pm and 1am.

About an hour ago I was making some food when I heard it again so I decided to climb up to the roof of my house to see if I can pinpoint where it's coming from, and what I saw left me shaking.

far away in the desert I saw a large dust cloud coming from the ground (like what a car makes when it's off-road but like 20 times bigger)
It was spinning with varying speeds but mainly slowly.
I kept staring at it till it stopped moving and the dust dissipated with it the mechanical noises stopped.

I have no idea what I just saw or why am I the only one hearing this damned noise or why was it so strong the first time, and I'm really hesitant to go where the giant cloud of dust was.

maybe tomorrow when there's light.

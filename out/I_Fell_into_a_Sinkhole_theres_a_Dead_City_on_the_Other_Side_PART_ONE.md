**CASE FILE uh… #2 I guess. I think my fight with Kushim counts as my first encounter to file. But here’s the shocking story about a recent discovery I made. Date: May 13th, 2021**

I had set up camp in that little-known town of Auburndale. But now I'm a monster hunter, trying to stop a war from breaking out between humans and alien monsters. But I guess it's also because I wanted something more out of life than the normal, routine world that was offered to me. Especially since thoughts of my ex-wife still linger in my head.

But just so we're clear, I'm not living by that cliffside. I don't need Kushim wanting to kill me again. This time I bought a mobile home closer towards the town center and have been reconnecting with some of the locals that helped me the first time I had to deal with the monster of Auburndale Forest Reserve. Well, now you know why it hasn’t been destroyed by the government.

Recently I had taken up a new hobby that some would say is extremely dangerous, becoming a fully fledged monster hunter. This hobby allows me to travel around, using most of my funds in the process of buying special gear like tactical clothing, stab resistant gloves, steel toe boots, night-vision goggles, and a variety of weapons, including an AK-47, Benelli M1014, and my favorite handgun, a Beretta M9. Just don't ask me where I got them.

That being said, I still had to work a typical job just like everyone else, spending my time doing but I always was good at; construction. Perhaps I might even build my own house one day.

Regardless, I still had to prepare for that war that has been brewing. We were going to need allies if we were going to prevent humanity from being drawn into something they clearly weren't ready for. Though considering that these aliens aren’t immune to human weapons, I’m confident that we would beat them. But should a war break out, the death toll would be staggering.

Also, the relationship between Kushim and I has been cool. About two months ago, I decided to go back into his territory to check on him. He would be a great asset in the coming battles ahead. Unfortunately he's rather distant with me. He doesn't attack me anymore, and he seems to be allowing me to inch closer into the woods. I thought I'd any moment he would take this opportunity to kill me, but not once has he made an attempt. Not even to intimidate me. So my hunch is that he knows that more Primordials will show up wanting his land and his subjugation, so he's willing to weigh his options on who his allies might have to be. Think of it as America and Russia vs Germany in WWII. We're not friends, but we kind of have a mutual reason for cooperation.

But something odd happened a few days ago that I'm going to tell everyone about. I found a city underground. And let me tell you, I thought I was going to lose my mind if I stayed there any longer. There were some things down there that I'd like to never see ever again. Well, I say it was underground but that would be an incorrect statement. The correct way of saying this is, you have to go underground in order to get to it.

\*\*\*

It happened on a Wednesday. I was reading through a forum on the deep web that talked about unusual phenomena that were found in local news articles, police reports, and folktales. Auburndale was one of these discussions. But there was a new article that was posted by someone named CardioG.

They said: *"Pancake People. That's right, I found a few blobs of flesh in the woods that were able to speak some incoherent words to me. I'm not making this up."*

Normally I would chalk this up to they're making it up. But they had pictures of what they saw and even a brief recording. When I watched it, I saw these pancake-shaped blobs that had eyes, blood, and a variety of different skin colors all mesh together.

A few people were quick to disregard it, but I decided to reply to their post.

"Where are these woods located? I'm an investigator and would like to take a look around."

For the rest of the day, I didn't get a reply. The next day though, I saw that they did respond.

"Smithland, Kentucky. It's a little out of the way and I was just going for a walk when I stumbled upon them. I thought about going to the police but didn't want to get involved. I went out to check on them yesterday and saw that they were gone. I don't know who could have moved them. If you want to go looking, be my guest."

I leaned back in my chair and thought about it. Looking up the town on the map, I saw that it was a little out of the way. But it wasn't too bad. I can be there within an hour or two.

I packed my things and after an hour and a half, I arrived at the sleepy town. The person who posted was right. It looked rather empty around here. But perhaps it was just this location.

I wasn't sure where exactly to start so I just looked for the largest patch of woods that I could find. That wasn't too hard to choose from.

Patch of forest after patch of forest, I wasn't able to find anything that didn't appear to be a flat blob. The sun was already setting and I had wasted the whole day looking around for something that either doesn't exist, or it genuinely had left the area. Which is a real shame because I was hoping for something interesting that happened. Even if it was mundane, perhaps I could have talked to the blobs.

I was doing one last round in a patch of woods that was a little to the north of the town, looking at the endless rows of trees with disappointment quickly catching up to my optimism.

Just when I was going to give up, I came across a rather large depression in the dirt. I thought that maybe this was a sinkhole that was quickly buried over.

But I heard something calling out to me. It was coming from the center.

"Help... me..."

I was hesitant to try and walk out there. But if there was someone who was in need of me, I couldn't leave them. I treaded carefully as I made my way towards the center of the depression and stared down.

Sure enough, there was an eye poking out. A human eye. I moved some of the dirt away from around it, but never did I see a nose, mouth, or any other facial features. Just long stretches of human skin.

"What in God's name-"

Suddenly, long, emaciated arms started stretching out of the dirt and surrounding me. They were as black as the night and their grip on my legs was unbreakable. I tried to get the fingers off me, but they wouldn't budge.

Before I could even think of grabbing my handgun, I was pulled into the dirt and found myself submerged. I hyperventilate, knowing full well that you can hold your breath longer when you do that, then held it in as long as I could. A part of me was praying that I would be able to breathe soon enough. But soon I was starting to lose consciousness and had to resist the urge to breathe in.

\*\*\*

Not too long afterwards, I woke back up and saw that I was laying inside what appeared to be an abandoned coffee shop. Next to me was a small depression of dirt that had penetrated through the marble flooring. Had I fallen up or down?

No matter, I needed to find my way home. I left the shop but quickly noticed a green hue in the sky. Sickly clouds that over casted and rained a green haze down onto the city. I wasn't getting hit by it but knew it was moving towards me.

I walked across the street, finally seeing the pancake-shaped blobs littering all around. They looked just like the video. They wiggled but appeared stationary. What was more concerning was the black veins that were crawling across the landscape.

"Hello!" I shouted.

I listened attentively. Nothing.

Again I shouted, "Hello! Is there anyone around who can walk on two legs?"

A distant, but animalistic screeching could be heard coming from the left of me.

"That's not good," I backed away and started checking all of the cars to see if I could drive one of them. They were either out of gas, or their keys were missing. I don't know how to jump start one- although I probably should be practicing.

Just when I was about to give up and start looking for another hole to climb down in, I heard the patterning of boots against water.

"Hold up," a feminine voice called out to me.

I looked around, trying my best to see if I could find whoever it was.

But somehow they got behind me and pressed a gun against my back, saying, "Turn around with your hands up. Make any move towards your gun and you'll find yourself dead,"

I did exactly as she said and when our eyes met, I saw that she was a teenager. She was wearing winter clothes with plastic wrap underneath. Her eyes also appeared callus, dead inside. Those eyes were enough to tell me that she had seen quite a few horrible things. Enough to drive away any semblance of humanity inside her.

"Look," I said. "I'm not from around here. I was just investigating some weird sightings back in Kentucky."

She lowered her handgun and appeared confused. "What? You're telling me you haven't lived here this whole time?"

"No, I just got here a little while ago. Hasn't even been a full day I believe."

She took a few steps back and started looking all around with panic in her eyes. "Is there really a connection?" she muttered.

She kept looking back and forth, eagerly trying to find something. But she turned back towards me just as quickly and grabbed me by the sleeve, dragging me forward and saying, "Where? Where did you come from? Please!"

I resisted a little, but I could tell that she was scared. She looked like she had been scared for a long time. I said, "Hold on, let's just slow down for a moment. It was in a coffee shop over there."

When I pointed in that direction, she released her grip and quickly started running towards that building. I followed after her and when we reached the shop, I saw her by the depression in the ground, eagerly trying to dig through the dirt with her bare hands.

"Hey, I don't think that's going to work."

"Then help me,"

"I mean it's pretty much caved in."

"I don't care, I need to get out of here."

I rested my hand on her shoulder and she ignored it. She kept digging and digging for about a few more minutes before she gave up.

"There's no way back through there." she exhaled in defeat.

She lifted her hands to her face and started crying. It was a little awkward for me, but I could see the desperation in her eyes. The hopelessness in her cries.

"Let's go somewhere to rest up, it seems to me that you've been trying to survive for a while now."

I thought she ignored me, but she slowly got to her feet and started for the door, saying with a growl, "Fine, but you better not try anything on me. I won't hesitate to kill you."

I swallowed fearfully. I wasn't too sure how much she had gone through to resort to something like that already, but all I wanted to do was get out of here too. But I needed to know why this city was here. At least she seems capable of defending herself.

But as we left the store, we were suddenly surrounded by two guys with deranged eyes staring at us.

"Oh, hello there," I tried to de-escalate immediately. I hadn’t had my gun ready. But shooting them wasn’t something I wanted to do. A deadly light beast, sure. A human being, still not ready for that can of worms.

The crazy old guy cackled, "Two choice meals Jim,"

The guy on the left whose hair looked as if it all had fallen out, replied, "The girl will be much more useful but I guess the man will make for a full meal."

"Hey guys, how about we not do this. It would be better for everyone if we went our separate ways. What do you say?"

The old man replied nasally, "No dice, we ran out of food and people are running out too. Can’t say I’m proud but survival of the fittest you know,"

Cannibals. I had never met any before but I was already preparing to fight if I could grab my weapon in time.

The two tried to give us the jump, but their starvation had given us the advantage. They were irrational animals and slow. That gave me time to react and miss the old man’s swing of his machete. I tossed him to the ground, but the girl pulled out her handgun again and simply shot her attacker. Her straight to the point attitude scared me and I knew to not mess with her. But the no hesitation in her about murder was even more frightening.

But she shocked me again when she turned her gun towards my guy and shot him in the head.

"Geez, you didn’t have to do that!" I yelled.

She had a cold glare in her eyes and said, "Yes, I had to."

Holstering her gun, she led the way, leaving me alone with my thoughts.

I took one last look at the men, rationalizing that it was probably for the best. Survival of the fittest, his own words.

But I did have one thing to say to her to make sure everything was cool between us. Need to make sure I can lower her hostilities before they turn on me.

"My name is Henry."

She didn’t stop walking but spoke casually back, "Samantha,"

At least things were calm with us now.

\*\*\*

We made it to an abandoned apartment building. We had to go through numerous back alleys and get as deep as it would go."

I asked, "Why do you have a home all the way in here? Wouldn't it be safer to go for the tallest building, or is there a danger that I should know about?"

"I assume you heard that roaring earlier? That creature is big enough to destroy entire skyscrapers so I find it best to get as far in these buildings as possible."

"I see,"

We went up a flight of stairs and made it to her room. I should have expected a teenager to be collecting tons of garbage and things that they don't need, but definitely want.

"How long have you been living here by yourself?" I asked.

She ignored my question and threw a sleeping bag to me. Funny, I already had one but it was lighter than this.

"Here, you're going to be here for a while. And don't even think about going outside at this time."

I looked over to the window and saw that it was raining. The rain had a green color to it which I thought was odd.

"What's wrong with the rain?" I guessed if that was the issue.

"It does terrible things to those who get touched by it." she looked like she was about to cry.

I decided not to push it any further. But it seems like I guessed correctly. There's something dangerous about the rain here. And whatever it was, it has left a bad memory on her.

I sat down on the ground and started unpacking some of my things, and she approached closer to me, having this look that she wanted to ask me questions. I had a feeling I knew what it was so I tried to get a conversation going.

"So, you want to know what's going on back on Earth?" I looked at her.

"Yeah," she mumbled.

"Well we have a pandemic going on but I’d say that’s the least of our problems. Especially since there's a much bigger threat lurking."

"Wait, what's the bigger threat?"

"Corruption of government, climate change, and potential war between rivaling countries. Oh, and a bunch of ancient beings that came to Earth millions of years ago are threatening to start up a genocidal campaign against humanity."

She raised your eyebrow and sat down next to me with her legs criss-crossed. "Are you joking about that last one? I can understand the other stuff but that one sounds a little out of the ordinary."

"No, telling you the truth. I'm actually thinking about joining the side that doesn't want these things to succeed in wiping out humanity."

"There's a side like that?"

"Yeah, I'm so far the only one but I might be able to convince one of the monsters to join my side if I give him a little incentive." I pinched my fingers whilst giving her a smirk.

"Incentive? Like what?"

"I let him take more land. I just haven’t had the time to tell him yet."

"Well at least there's someone who cares. Here, people are devolving into savages." she muttered before growing quiet.

"I'm surprised that they're still other people around. I was starting to think you were the only one here."

She hissed, "Besides the flesh blobs, the fungus walkers, and the..." she trailed off, like she was refusing to utter its name.

I wanted to ask her more, seeing that there were a lot of unanswered questions on her side, but I figured it wouldn’t be worth it.

"Be careful sleeping. In case things get really bad, I like to wear the shock collar to sleep."

She handed one to me and I was just about going to laugh if she thought I was going to put on a dog collar.

"I'll pass,"

"I insist." her eyes were serious. Something was definitely up, and sleep was the issue.

"Gonna fill me in?" I asked.

She turned back and walked towards her room. She said before closing the door, "No. As long as you're wearing it, you should be fine. I wear one too just so you know, so you don't have to feel stupid."

"But why not tell me why?"

She pointed to her arm and said that she wouldn't mention anything of them. She seemed scared to utter what was to happen.

*What did sleeping have to do with all those arms?* I thought.

Well, I didn't want to go to sleep now. I tried to pass the time by looking for a phone signal, which proved to be in vain, so I kept trying to remember some of those weird hieroglyphics I found in a cave back in Kushim's forest. I remember there being a depiction of a beam of light traveling up but not so far above the ground.

"What were those called?" I asked myself.

The pillar of light was surrounded by rocks that resembled Stonehenge. But what exactly were they about? Kushim wasn't going to tell me, though I am thankful that he doesn't seem to have a taste for me anymore. He's ignored me every time I've gone exploring his woods now.

I remember going to a Native American that lived in the area. He said it was something, a sort of bridgeway between worlds and realms.

"Was it an Anubis point? No, no, it was something else. Besides, Anubis is some Egyptian god. It was a... Nexus... yeah, a Nexus Point. And if she's from Earth, and this whole city is from Earth, then that means the town must have fallen into a Nexus Point. Now it's on another plane of reality."

But if there is a Nexus Point here that can bring the city to this dimension, that means the Nexus Point is still around, especially since it was able to bring me here and it seems like she's been here for much longer. All we really got to do is go looking for it. This is my only shot at getting back home.

\*\*\*

About an hour or two had passed and I was already starting to feel the effects of sleep deprivation. With nothing to do, bored and was setting in and boredom makes it harder to stay awake. I was already tired from today and I desperately wanted to try and keep my eyes open.

I tried walking back and forth, but that was proving a little more noisy than I expected, I didn't want to disturb the girl. I sat down and kept looking at the shock collar. I really didn't want to wear that, it looked so uncomfortable.

After bouncing my leg for about ten minutes, I conceded and put it on. Not about to do something stupid like, "I know what's best for me." She's lived here for quite some time and if she says it's necessary, I'd be wise to heed her advice.

It was just as uncomfortable as you would expect. I laid back into my sleeping bag and stared at the wall for a good while. I wasn't sure how much time had passed but eventually I was overcome by sleep.

I opened my eyes to find myself standing at the edge of a cliff. The trees that were down below reminded me of the Auburndale Forest Reserve. It was dark, foggy, and surprisingly cold. I turned around and saw the charred remains of my old house.

Nothing about this felt right. My senses were completely aware, and I was having a level of consciousness that shouldn't have been possible in a dream state. It was as if I was awake while dreaming.

A strong gust of wind overtook me, blowing away the Embers of my destroyed home and tossing it over the edge of the cliff like a climactic plume of smoke that descended deep into the oblivion of trees.

But the cold was growing worse. My whole body was tingling and I felt an overwhelming amount of dread suffocating my rationale. My heart rate was intensifying to a degree that made it feel deathly painful. Every inch of my body was screaming to me that I was in mortal danger.

I kept looking around, frantically looking up at the night sky above, but only seeing a green mist that was descending towards me.

I felt a liquid escaping my eyes. Was I crying? Why was I crying. But when I went to wipe it, there was a green, sticky liquid attached to my finger. My finger started to dissolve and turn into an elastic substance and fall towards the ground.

My legs were shaking and I was brought to my knees shortly afterwards. I looked over the edge of the cliff, unsure of why all this was happening. But when I looked closer, I could see something far more earth-shatteringly worse!

Those weren't trees that I was looking at. Those were arms. Long, emaciated, charcoal black arms. Their fingers stretched out painfully, clasping quickly for anything that might come within their reach.

Suddenly, they all turned towards me. They reached up, wishing to grab hold of me. I was still too far up from their height, but they kept whispering to me. And those whispers were slowly turning into screams of torment. They were in agony and wanted to pull me in and force me to join them in their misery. What are they?

I wanted to back away, escape from this nightmare. My legs refuse to budge and I desperately wanted to find a way to end my life. I did not want to go and join them. The idea of spending eternity in everlasting torture and to be pulled apart by their hateful desire to strip me of my body and leave my mind to rot with time itself was enough for me to want the freedom of death.

Then a pair of hands came up behind me and pushed me over the edge. I was falling, falling, falling. I looked up and saw more arms growing out from the top. They were everywhere. They're extent was all things that existed. And they would have what they wanted. I looked down and saw that I was approaching the sea of arms. They were easier to begin their destruction of me.

I screamed. I was screaming so loud, crying out to be spared this. And then I felt an intense shock around my neck.

I threw myself up, my body covered in a cold sweat. The girl had already opened her door and she was just staring at me. I looked around, realizing where I was and that I was safe again. Safe from the world of nightmares.

"What- dear God, what was that?" I held my hand to my heart, trying to calm down my painful breathing.

"That's why I wear a shock collar. It's always there to wake you up right before they take you." she had this coldness in her voice.

She didn't seem concerned with me, confident that she had gotten her point across. But before she closed the door, I said to her in my most sincere voice, "Thank you. My God, thank you. That... that..."

"It's okay. After a while, you get used to it and learn to ignore the adrenaline rush that it gives you each time. Though I doubt you'll get any more sleep, this being your first night."

First night? This is going to be my last night. I thought she was crazy if she thought I was going to spend another moment in this realm. I needed to find a Nexus Point and get back to Earth. This city didn't just pop here by random chance. It was brought here. The question is, where is the epicenter of this lost city.

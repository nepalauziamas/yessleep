* Its every fucking goddamn night and i'm tired, she makes the same chocolate cake with two cherries on top.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* At first I thought it was sweet and the day after that but things started to get annoying I love sweets but it was always the same chocolate cake, Since we got off our honeymoon shes made the same chocolate cake nothing different nothing less.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* our children have become sick and tired more often because of this stupid chocolate cake. 5 Days ago I decided to put a stop to it, I've recently placed a few cameras in the kitchen to find what's in the cake and why she keeps making it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* A Little background information I've been married to my wife for 40 years we both got hitched at 21, we both met each other in high school at 17 and have been high school lovers since then.

&#x200B;

* She became a stay at home mom and I worked as a mechanic, This whole chocolate cake thing happend once we got to our newly furnished home she had decided to make some yummy dessert for dinner.

&#x200B;

* It had been a delicious chocolate cake with two reddish red cherries on top and appealing chocolate frosting but now it's been a nightmare for me and my family.

&#x200B;

* Even on holidays she makes the cake, and before you ask I've confronted her and all she does is ignore me as if she had never heard my question.

&#x200B;

* That Monday night I set up the cameras in the kitchen making sure not to alarm my wife so she wouldn't notice, then I waited at dinner time watching her make signature spaghetti and meatballs.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* Then she pulled out the chocolate cake mix she begged me to buy, even if I said no she would somehow sneak the chocolaty powder anyway.

&#x200B;

* I Watched as she put in the ingredients normally eggs,water and a cake tin, then I watched as she pulled out a mixture that looked like rat poison.

&#x200B;

* Was she planning to kill me?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* It hit me hard like a rock thrown at your stomach.

&#x200B;

* Finally I decided to confront her.

&#x200B;

* Luckily the camera had a microphone.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

* "Debby what are you putting in that cake?"" I Said.

&#x200B;

* My wife slowly turned around and responded.

&#x200B;

* "I Didn't want it to turn out this way Donald but it was the only way it would make you love me." She said
* &#x200B;
* &#x200B;
* "My family has used this recipe for years for their lovers, i'm sorry Donald" She said.

&#x200B;

* Finally it all clicked this bitch had been using some type of love spell to make me love her.

&#x200B;

* Then I remembered something I never really loved her, our parents put us into a forced marriage 
* &#x200B;
* and sent us on our way but I guess when she saw I didn't love her she put the antidote in the cake.

&#x200B;

* &#x200B;
* &#x200B;
* I Locked myself in our room scared of what she would do now that I knew.

&#x200B;

* Luckily we have a computer in our room.

&#x200B;

* I Looked it up online and it seems I only have 3 days left to live.

&#x200B;

* Every hour I hear banging and screaming for me to open the door.

&#x200B;

* But she doesn't know i can hear the knife on the other side scraping the door.

&#x200B;

* Hopefully someone can help me escape.

&#x200B;

* There's an open window but i'm hoping to escape without her noticing me.

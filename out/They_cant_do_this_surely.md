 It started with the crash.  


It was the worst thing that happened to our town in a long time. A tragic loss of life that sent ripples of sorrow throughout the community. The local news reported that the driver had taken cocaine before he got behind the wheel; that he hadn’t spotted the young couple crossing quickly enough to slow down.  


The poor boy he hit was never going to walk again. And that poor girl… well she wasn’t going to either, but at least she wouldn’t be around to suffer that.  


The flowers went up fast. They always do when things happen in a community like ours. A small shrine built at the site of the tragedy, made up of wilting lilies, angelic photographs and mournful notes. The candlelight vigil was scheduled for the following evening, at 9.08pm. The same time as the crash.  


The girl who died was the daughter of my mum’s hairdresser. Even such a tenuous connection supposedly warranted our presence at the vigil. It was an impressive turnout, the area littered with people desperate to look kind and sympathetic as they became the voyeurs of misery.  


As 9.06 came round an organiser began to light and pass round the candles. I clutched the tea light in my hands, cupping them slightly to protect it from the elements. The whole crowd was illuminated, lights darting all around me as a squinted my eyes.  


Then there was a scream.  


I didn’t see how it happened, but that man who had been passing round the candles had gotten his sleeve caught on fire, and it was quickly spreading up his arm. I watched as chaos unfolded and some stepped forward to help as others retreated in horror.  


My mother dragged me all the way back to the car, away from the scene and the awful screaming. As we drove away I could still see the flames dancing in the rear view mirror.  


The next morning local Facebook groups were alive with chatter about the two major incidents. The man who had been burning had survived, albeit in intensive care with 85% burn coverage. Those who had stayed longer than I had were bonding over their shared trauma and revelling in their unusually meaningful conversations.  


It was awful. Despite my lack of personal connection to either tragedy I recognised the impact on the community and the families of those harmed. It was hard not to think about. But in the grand scheme of things life goes on… right?  


Tragedies happen every day, my town just seemed to be having some poor luck.  


The next day was when I got my own taste of personal tragedy. It was also the day things went from sad to completely fucked in my little town.  


My mother collapsed that morning. It was quiet in the house until she hit the floor with a thud. She’d been diagnosed with low blood pressure but she’d never lost consciousness before, so I panicked. I called the ambulance only to be met with a robotic voice down the phone.  


*Emergency services are not covering your area today. Please try again later.*  


I frowned, feeling my panic intensify as I stared at my mums pale skin. Not sure what to do I knocked on the door of a neighbour. She was a busybody but she meant well. She helped me safely get mum into the back of her car and drove in the direction of the hospital.  


The hospital was just on the edge of town, surrounded by a few suburban houses and wheat fields. As we sped into the carpark it was quickly apparent that something was wrong. There were lines and clusters of injured and sick people pouring out of the entrance doors, littering the areas between the cars. My heart started pounding.  


“Somethings going on! This isn’t normal! Someone PLEASE HELP!”  


“Why won’t the police answer - he’s still out there!”  


“She’s dying! Get out of the way!”  


They were just some of the frantic things I heard as we drove into that car park. Amongst the panicked crowds of people were pleading calls of agony and anguish. I felt a creeping sense of dread, the first person had been right. This wasn’t normal. This many people in one area didn’t have emergencies all at once.  


My neighbour looked at me, sensing the unrest that was starting to build in the crowd. She held out her hand and grabbed mine, suggesting we find a way in to get a nurse out to the car. I knew it wasn’t that simple, but I nodded and held on tight.  


As we worked our way through the crowd we saw a violent energy building. People were desperate, they were willing to do anything to be seen. At one point I saw an elderly woman run over a small girls foot with her wheelchair, both competing to reach the hospital doors. Near the entrance at the front of the crowd was a woman clutching her clearly deceased husband.  


“This town is cursed.” She wept. “They’re never going to let us out.”  


I swallowed a lump in my throat as we kept on past her, my thoughts stuck on her words. What if the town was cursed? What if she was right? Who wasn’t letting us out?  


The first person we came into contact with inside was a cleaner. They were crying. They told us that there were no more beds and the wards were collapsing under the demand. Casualties were presenting with a range of ailments; from lesser complaints like dizziness and chest pains, all the way up to stabbings and gory injuries.  


The waiting room was packed to the brim, and was an intensified version of the panic in the car park. I felt my anxiety increasing the longer I knew my mum was still out there, unconscious in the car. We navigated a sea of people trying to pick out a medical professional.  


In the crowd the conversations were all focused on one thing.  


“We tried to drive out to the next hospital but there’s armed guards at every exit.” A sobbing woman told another frightened lady, a sickly looking child cuddled in her lap.  


“What did they say?” I asked, interrupting with little care.  


“They said the town is under quarantine following recent events. They wouldn’t tell us anything else.” She answered, before kissing her child on the forehead.  


I punched the emergency number into my phone again.  


*Emergency services are not covering your area today. Please try again later.*  


I must have listened to that same message twenty times. I blinked and blinked trying to Will it all away but the nightmare didn’t end. After what must have been an hour we had to admit defeat and fight our way back to the car.  


Outside had grown more chaotic in the time we’d been inside. People were fighting, screaming and blood lacquered the pavements and roads. As we reached the section my neighbours car was in, with my mother inside, my heart dropped.  


The entire section was engulfed by flames. Rioters had begun setting light to the parked cars and no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t find a penetrable spot to enter and reach my mum. As I listened to the screaming and clanking and bashing, time stopped. I shed a tear, a single tear that fought through the terror, as I realised she was gone.  


I don’t know how I got separated from my neighbour but I did. I don’t know how I found this security cupboard, but I did. It’s dark and it’s grim but the crowds can’t find me here.  


I know my phone doesn’t have much battery left and we are fucked. I also know that despite the Armageddon I’m sitting in that you won’t find a damn thing about it on the news.  


I tried to Google the recorded message, see what was happening with the armed guards but there’s nothing.  


In fact, there aren’t even the local articles about that damn crash anymore. Or the fire at the vigil. There’s no local news sites at all. It’s like they’ve been wiped from the internet entirely. They weren’t the only thing either. There’s no record of us at all.  


*No record of our entire town.*  


Even on maps I google, it’s gone. It’s replaced by a bit of water so subtle that no non local would notice. I can’t dial any number but emergency and all it does is play me that stupid, bullshit message.  


*Emergency services are not covering your area today. Please try again later.*  


The longer I wait in this cupboard and the longer I listen the the wails and cries of all my neighbours the less likely I think it is that the message will ever change. I’m losing hope.  


So this is my last shot. I don’t know if this will post, but if it does… please help us.

I don’t know where to start this story. It’s pretty crazy and takes a lot of turns, so just buckle up. I’ve always had sleep problems. Wether it’s having trouble falling asleep, or waking up in the middle of the night to a bad dream, but what happened to me a few days ago has NEVER happened before. 

A few days ago, I went to sleep faster, and better than usual. I went to the sleep of the thought of going back to being a kid, playing with my dolls and hanging out at school with my friends. I was wishing of what it would be like to be a kid again. As I was thinking, I remember thinking about how bad my sleeping habits were. Staying up until 12 on a school night, and waking up early feeling tired and drowsy. Just remembering the fact that I could’ve actually gotten rest rather than having to pray I would get at least 4 hours in, made me mad that I didn’t take that chance when I could have. What a stupid kid I thought, then I remembered what made me stay up so late.

I was really into horror movies. Like I would watch a new one almost every night if I could. The reason for my love of horror was just because I wasn’t afraid of anything. Like if I woke up and a clown holding a knife was at bed, I wouldn’t freak out. But now as an adult, I would scream and pray that this was a dream. Well, one day it wasn’t.

Lets go back to the night I was talking about in the beginning. That night, I went to sleep, and I had a dream. Not just any dream, a nightmare. I had a nightmare about creepy things happening to me, and that next day it did. I’m not going to get into extreme detail though because it gets weird, but some key things that happened were almost getting kidnapped, almost starting a fire, and almost getting into a car wreck. Sounds bad right? Well that all happened to me in ONE day. It all starts out with me waking up in the middle of the night. I was scared because of the events in my dream, but I decided not to waste my time trying to go back to sleep, and so I then start my day.

I started the day with a cup of coffee like always, then getting my clothes on, and so on. Then I watched the news to see that there was a ton of missing people. Where I live, this is pretty common so I kinda just went back to breakfast, until I smelt something. I looked over and saw a fire on my stove. I realized after I made my egg, I left the stove on with nothing on it. My favorite, expensive, non-stick pan was on fire. I immediately rushed to the sink, filling up a cup with water as fast as I could, spilling water everywhere while I dumped it on the fire. After that, I was relieved that it was out, but not relieved with the big mess I caused. 

After I cleaned up, I started heading out for my weekly grocery run that I always do on my day off. On the way there, I got stuck in traffic as usual so I waited, longer than usual, until a car came going past the speeding limit heading towards my direction. This is where things started to get weird, especially since they all happened in my dream last night… 

Anyways, after I almost got into a car wreck, I headed to the store and I picked out my items. I didn’t need much today, so after I checked out I walked to my car with the idea of heading to my mom’s house until a man in all black, came up behind and said something along the lines of, “Hey pretty lady, you need a ride? I got a beer in the back.” I immediately realized it was the man I’d saw on the tv earlier. I got out my phone, took a picture, and called the cops. He tried to pick me up and drag me to his car, but luckily other people were there and witnessed it happen. Some strong men were able to hold him down until the cops came. 

After these crazy, life-threatening events happened to me, I decided to speak with my doctor about it and he said he couldn’t help with my nightmare situation, but he could help with my sleeping. I eventually was able to get medicine but it hasn’t helped because i’m scared of sleeping now. Moral of the story, don’t watch horror movies 24/7 as a kid, and be grateful for 4+ hours of sleep.

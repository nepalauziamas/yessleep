Title: I found this weird group of friends

I was walking with my dog in the middle of the night, because my dog really needed some energy, as I was walking I saw my highschool! It was my old high school which not a lot of people visit now. I was a group of friends  when I was looking at the school, I could hear them fighting screaming, but why? I didn't know the reason, I looked back at my dog and I found out he for some reason disappeared. I was looking around the place looking for him after 4-5 hours.

 I found a cabin I'd never seen before, I've been living in the same city for 5-6 years now, and I've never seen this cabin. I looked around and found no one outside the cabin. I decided to check the cabin because of curiosity, the cabin had dead kids, and mostly the missing ones. Yes, there are some missing kids in our city, I was really sad to see some young kids die in a cabin. I decided to leave because the cabin looked bigger on the inside. 

I was about to leave but it started raining, I didn't have my umbrella with me, I really freaked out I looked around, and saw some screams, I made a choice that I'd leave the cabin no matter what even if the rain comes, I realized the door was locked. After all my screaming , crying no one came even not the group of friends, the cabin had many pictures of people that I DARED to ever look at, most of them were half broken. 

I also realized going into a cabin I didn't know was the biggest mistake. The cabin didn't have a clock, I did have my watch, but of course, it surely not the time it said, my watch is broken but I always hope to fix it some time, After finally some time, I looked at the window and decided to escape from there, the window was locked? I finally after many thoughts I had no other choice than going more inside. I prayed I would be okay , I really did. After going in I made a rough choice to look at the pictures. Most of them are drawings and some were of actual people. I saw a bloody knife there, I quickly freaked out. 

I thought to myself "what have I gotten myself into?" I decided I had to go deep. Because there was no way of getting out. And oh, it was MUCH, MUCH, bigger on the inside. I saw plenty of rooms. I decided to visit one because for some reason I remembered this place a little bit for some reason. 

One of the rooms had a child which looked.. like the child wasn't fed for a while. I'm lucky the child didn't notice me, the child started eating some mud from the floor-?.. I quickly felt a Bad feeling in my head like this was gonna be bad. Then I quickly left the room, and for some reason I passed out. I woke up after 9-10 hours I noticed it still wasn't morning.



 I felt a bit older than I actually was.


 I was still in the cabin, this time I decided to do everything possible. I decided not to check the other rooms, I got more deep and deep, I could almost feel like I was back in time. It felt like my brain had been really bad lately. Then I found a window! I was about to jump out until what I was outside it. It's just. More of the cabin! It was a trick, I really felt dizzy. Then I heard echoes of children screaming, crying and more.


 I couldn't hear what it exactly was, because it was all types of emotions.



Some laughing, some crying, some screaming, some saying something, that I couldn't understand.



I was pretty sure it was just a dream or something like that.

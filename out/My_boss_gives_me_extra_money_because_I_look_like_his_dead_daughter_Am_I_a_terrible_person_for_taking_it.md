Looking at Stephen’s house from the outside, you never would have pegged him for a hoarder. Oh sure, the garden had an occasional bald spot, plus there was a rusty tricycle laying on its side, but I’d seen worse. Way worse.

It wasn't until he pulled open the door that I get a (literal) taste of what lay in store.

A thick, pungent scent wafted across the porch; picture rotten eggs mixed with a clogged toilet at a Mexican restaurant. That spicy warmth really made my eyes well up.

“I’m Stephen,” said the man. He was a huge, out-of-shape guy in his fifties, dressed in a grey sweatshirt covered with BBQ sauce.

“Courtney,” I replied, after stifling a retch. “The cleaning service sent me?”

“Nice to meet you, Courtney.” He repeated the name several times. “You know, you don’t look like a Courtney. I’d say you’re more of an…*Annie*.”

“…Okay.”

I got straight to work, starting with a downstairs lounge where the carpet lay buried beneath ankle-deep fast-food wrappers with rotted leftovers still inside. I battled my way across that mound of filth, blasting furious swarms of flies with disinfectant along the way.

Come sundown, that was the only room even remotely close to clean. “This is gonna be a bigger job than I thought,” I told Stephen. “We’re talking weeks.”

“That’s okay. I can pay.”

On day two, I tackled the kitchen. The sticky floor gripped the soles of my shoes and held on tight, to the point each step became a tug-of-war.

As I washed and dried a tower of used dishes, Stephen hovered nearby, periodically making unusual remarks about my clothes and make-up. *I think a darker shade of rogue would make your cheekbones pop. You’ve really got more of a summer complexion, have you tried wearing more yellows?*

After stripping an initial layer of garbage away from the ground floor, I discovered a rather retro house hidden underneath. Most of the furniture was from the seventies: linoleum flooring, old-fashioned record players, floral sofas. Kids' toys lay scattered around here and there–as well as a children’s chef hat–which struck me as odd since Stephen lived alone. Still, not the weirdest thing you’d stumble across in this line of work.

Toward the end of that first week, as I made my way out the front door, he said, “Here’s an idea: what if I cancel the service and pay you directly? The agency takes most of the cash for doing nothing, right?”

That had never happened before, and my boss would hit the roof if he found out, but I needed the money real bad.

Stephen waved a wad of £20 notes in front of my face, enticingly.

“Sounds good,” I said.

And so I went back day after day, gradually penetrating deeper and deeper into Stephen’s layer. There were moments when the temptation to quit was great—like when I uncovered a section of wall he’d wiped boogers all over. That mound of dried snot had enough texture that a skilled rock climber could have scaled it.

Empty pill bottles lay scattered around here and there: under couch cushions, inside cabinets.

Toward the end of each shift, Stephen thanked me for doing a wonderful job and stuffed a generous tip into my palm. My hands looked like a child's clasped within his lunchbox-sized mitts. Every time he held on just a little *too* long, making a moist sickness slide up my throat. But soon my crappy only-works-half-the-time Ford Fiesta had been replaced by a snazzy Toyota Auris. The generous bonuses made dealing with the creep much easier.

In an upstairs bedroom, I excavated a bedroom decorated with He-Man posters and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles bedsheets. I didn’t ask whose they belonged to…

Things got really weird in week two after I tossed away junk piled into a storage closet and came across an old photo album. Was nosing through it a gross invasion of my client's privacy? Most definitely. But I’m a nosey person.

Most of the photos depicted a girl who looked like a younger me. I flicked past pictures of family gatherings and holidays at Disneyland, toward ones of her as a young lady. Dye my hair blonde and we’d make a perfect set. That striking resemblance couldn’t have been a coincidence.

In several photos, she was with her father–a man who had to be a younger Stephen.  Is that why he said I looked more like an Annie? Had he hired me because I reminded him of his daughter? Maybe she died, causing him to enter a downward spiral of depression which resulted in the absolute pigsty of a house. That certainly explained the kid’s room; poor guy probably decorated it with her old possessions to keep her memory alive.

I called my former boss, keeping the door shut so Stephen wouldn’t overhear, and demanded an explanation.

“That guy asked for you by name, wouldn’t take anybody else,” he said, casually.

“How’d he even know who I was?”

My boss didn’t know or care. He didn’t want to lose any business by refusing a request, never mind the fact one of his employees might have gotten murdered by some psycho. That's a risk he was willing to take.

Stephen needed a therapist, not a maid who looked like his deceased daughter's doppelganger. I made an excuse to take off early, but as I climbed into my car, he caught up and handed over a *very* generous bonus. “Same time tomorrow?” he asked, earnestly.

On one hand, it felt sleazy and underhanded to take his money. But then again, nobody was getting hurt. Right?

“Sure,” I said immediately.

Throughout the next few sessions, Stephen got a little *too* friendly. Even sniffed my neck at one point. “What’s that perfume? Jasmine?”

“…Lily and violet,” I replied. Goosebumps rose along my arms.

He pushed out his tongue. “Eugh. You should try orange blossom instead. It’d suit you better.”

By now the job was almost done. For the sake of decency, I won’t go into detail about the bathroom, but let’s just say the porcelain fixtures weren’t white to start with...

On my way out the front door, Stephen sighed and said, “I just wanted to say thanks. These past few years…they’ve been rough. You really turned this place around. And there’s gonna be an extra-special bonus in it for you.”

Something about the way he spoke tugged my heartstrings. The poor guy *really* missed his daughter.

My final challenge was the master bedroom, where the trash was piled so high my head brushed the ceiling navigating over the top. Most of that crap went into the bin, and soon only a few discarded items lay about.

After lifting a busted ironing board off the wall, I discovered a framed photo of a mother and son mounted along the wall. It was my doppelganger again, much older now, with her arm wrapped around an oddly familiar, overweight child.

I leaned closer. The kid looked like Stephen. Wait. That meant the lady from the photos wasn’t his daughter.

As a clammy breath engulfed the back of my neck, my guts cringed. Something turned over in my stomach.

There, reflected in the frame, directly behind my left shoulder, was Stephen. Before I could react, his hand clamped around the back of my skull and jammed my face into the picture frame, shattering it. Then he grabbed my shoulder and twisted it painfully until there was a loud pop. I screamed.

Blood leaked out of my forehead, stinging my eyes. Stephen threw me onto the ground and held a damp rag—one that smelled like the bleach I used to clean tiled surfaces—against my mouth and nose. Black swirls danced in front of my eyes, and even through the haze I knew nobody heard me scream, because the closest neighbour lived at the very bottom of the lane.

Blurry hands moved over me, wrestling my arms into sleeves, shimmying a skirt all the way up to my waist. When I came back around, now in the downstairs lounge, Stephen bent forward, kissed my forehead, and said, “Welcome home mommy.”

My vision was still swimming but settled enough to make out a pair of Super Mario pyjamas, three sizes too small for their occupant. I blinked several times. Stephen’s exposed hairy navel poked out above the waistband and sleeves strangled his forearms and ankles. On a nearby table sat a photo of him and his mother building a sandcastle down by the beach.

Once the room stopped dancing the foxtrot, I looked down. My captor had dressed me in old-fashioned, bright, homey clothes; the kind women wore in those old-fashioned ‘nuclear family’ ads. And had he doused me with orange blossom perfume? I absolutely reeked of the stuff.

My hands were tied behind my back, and my left shoulder was on fire. Where had the bastard hidden my phone?

Stephen gave my cheek a big, long, wet kiss. “I’m so glad you’re home, Mommy. I was lonely without you.”

Why did he keep calling me Mommy? “Stephen…please.”

“No mommy, you always called me Stevie. Remember?” He smiled, but there was something in his expression I didn’t like. A sort of malice. His voice sounded odd, too. Threatening.

I swallowed a gulp and said, “Stevie.” His expression softened at that. “Stevie…my shoulder really, *really* hurts. Can you please call for an ambulance?”

“Silly Mommy, you can’t go to the hospital. We haven’t had dinner yet.”

“Let’s phone for an ambulance first. We’ll stop at McDonalds along the way.”

“No,” he shouted, stomping up and down with his fists clenched, like a toddler who’d been told they can’t have dessert before supper. Without warning, he grabbed the picture of the desk and hurled it into the sidewall. The shattering sound made me flinch. Next time, that might be my skull.

“We’re only allowed McDonalds on special occasions, remember?” he asked.

“Of course,” I said, my quiet voice trembling. There was no choice other than to play along. “But we haven’t seen each other for a while. Doesn’t that make today a spe—”

In response to him clenching his jaw, I quickly change to: “You’re right. Dinner first.”

“Yay,” he bounced up and down, beaming. Then, with barely any effort, he threw me over his shoulder and carried me into the kitchen. As he set me down at the table, a plan formed in the back of my mind. “Stevie, Mommy needs her hands to cook, but they seem to be stuck. Maybe you could…” I twisted sideways, letting him fill in the blanks.

“No Mommy, *I’m* the cook. Remember?” He pulled a child-sized chef's hat out of the drawer and balanced it on his head. “I’m your little helper.”

Bollocks. “Ah.”

He slid some chicken strips and chips onto a tray and placed them in the oven.

While waiting for the timer, he cycled around the table on a tricycle, occasionally striking a chair or cabinet, comically oversized on the tiny thing. The nerve endings in my shoulder begged for mercy, and that pain was only growing worse.

He shovelled the meal onto a plate, then a fork was in my mouth, dumping undercooked chicken down my throat. I only swallowed to keep my captor from exploding again.

I said, “Stevie, now we’ve ate, can you please take Mommy to the hospital?”

“No Mommy, it’s almost bedtime.”

“ I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep. I’m in too much pain.”

“That’s okay, we’ve got the nighty-nighty pills. You said we were gonna take them together and go to sleep, before you went away without me. Remember?"

The temperature plummeted twenty degrees. “Maybe we should skip the pills.” I faked a yawn. “I’m actually kinda—”

“No,” he snapped, eyes fixated on me. He somehow grew *more* menacing, to the point I could have sworn he doubled in size. “We’re going to take the nighty-nighty pills together. Like you said.”

Red alert, red alert, danger Will Robinson. This was bad. Seriously bad. I don’t know what happened to Stephen’s ‘Mommy’, but I guessed he hadn’t cleaned the house since…

As memories of the pictures sloshed around inside my mind, another bright idea came to me. “Stevie, I’ve been thinking. It’s so nice to be back, but there’s one thing that’s still not right.”

He screwed up his face.

“My hair. So much time has passed, it’s gone brown, see?” I craned my neck forward. “For it to be like before, I’ll have to go blonde. We should run down to the store and pick up some dye.”

“Oh, we don’t need to run to the store.”

My heart plunged as he scurried off into another room and came back holding a box with a smiling blonde model on the front.

“Great,” I said through gritted teeth.

He scooped me up, again, and carried me into the bathroom. Turns out he actually knew what he was doing—he protected my hairline with Vaseline, clipped my locks into sections to paste the dye in bit by bit, and even used an old toothbrush to fill in the roots.

Thirty minutes later, he grabbed the showerhead, set me on the edge of the tub, and gave my hair a thorough rinse. Dark brunette to light blonde was a huge ask of some over-the-counter dye, although it worked well enough to indulge Stephen’s deluded fantasy.

He held a photo next to my face. “Now you look exactly like before.”

My eyes quickly scanned the photo. “Well, not exactly. My hair was shorter back then too.”

“You’re right.”

He took off like an excited puppy and returned holding a pair of metal scissors. Crap. I needed a way out. Appeasing this idiot was only gonna get me killed.

Quickly I cleared my throat and tried to sound like my mother. “Sweetie, you’re too young to use the scissors.”

“Am not,” he said, already pretty heated. My heart hammered at what felt like 300 beats a minute and my gut begged me to stop. I suppressed that urge. “Disobedient little brat,” I snapped.

Stephen’s anger vanished, replaced with horror.

“Why can’t you do what you’re told, Stephen.” There was enough venom in that statement to make him deflate. “Untie mommies’ hands and give her the scissors.” He stared at me, dumbfounded, until I added a piercing, “Now.”

Using the scissors, he cut away my restraints. “I’m sorry Mommy. I didn’t mean to make you mad.”

He obediently handed over the scissors, put the right side of his head on my lap, then began to sob, all while sucking his own thumb.

“That’s okay,” I said, softly. Then I took three deep breaths.

The scissors came down in a shining arc. They plunged straight into Stephen’s left eye, and when I let go, they stood all by themselves.

Immediately he jumped up and thrashed around, his head like a pin cushion. He screamed and tripped over the toilet, the back of his head crashing into the nearby wall. As he ripped the scissors out, blood and eye jelly seeped from the wound. That shocked me to my senses, then I barrelled out of the room.

Less than five steps across the hall Stephen hooked my legs together from behind. My chin hit the wooden floor, hard, and while I lay dazed, babbling nonsensically, he dragged me into the bedroom, threw me onto the bed, and grabbed a bottle of pills from a nearby cabinet.

There was blood splattered over the wall to my left, from where Stephen had rammed my head into the picture-frame. Shards of glass lay scattered over the section of the floor directly beneath it.

Clenching a handful of pills in his left fist, Stephen sat on top of me. Fingers fumbled over my mouth as he tried to jam those tiny capsules down my throat while his other hand clamped my nostrils together. My lips sealed shut tighter than a hydraulic press.

Soon my body begged for oxygen; it was do or die time. Quickly I reached up and jabbed two fingers straight into Stephen’s mushy eye socket. As he shrieked, I sat up and pushed even further. They disappeared right up to the second knuckle.

Stephen dropped the pills and ripped my hand away, his screams climbing higher and louder. I seized the opportunity and rolled onto the floor, my right hand all wet and slimy. He dived after me, one hand against his eye to stifle the injury, the other awkwardly fumbling over me.

I felt along the ground, grabbed the closest piece of glass, spun around to face my attacker, and cut along his forearm, opening a gash right down to the bone. When he fell backward, I sprung forward and stabbed the shard into his throat.

Blood launched from Stephen’s wound like a powerful jet, splattering across the walls and furniture. Within seconds the room looked like a slaughterhouse. Bubbles of saliva inflated and shrunk above poor little Stevie's lips as his breathing slowed way down, before finally ceasing completely.

In a state of complete shock, I used the bed to climb to my feet. It was over. The bastard was dead.

My first point of call had to be the neighbour's place, where I’d call an ambulance and then the police. I stepped over Stephen's corpse and made my way toward the door. And there, as I glanced back, all I could think was: *man, the clean-up on this place is* [*gonna be a fucking nightmare.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)

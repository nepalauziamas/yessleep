My friends and I made a mistake last weekend, my parents didn't believe me, the police wouldn't believe me, so I hope you all believe me. At the very least, I need to tell this story. At the very least, I am hoping to feel better.

Last weekend my friends and I decided to explore an abandoned house in our town. Our town is smaller, and nothing too crazy ever happens here.

Our parents often tell us about when our town was bustling: During that time, there was a lot of traffic in and out of the town. The reason for this was a wave of new jobs opened in town. Money was good, and tons of new people were coming to town. All of that changed when jobs began losing business. She has never been specific about what happened, but needless to say, many people left town. No one moves here much anymore, so there are many abandoned houses.

There is one house that we have been told not to enter for years! For as long as I can remember, my mother told me to stay away from this house. The only explanation we got was that the house was run down on the inside. It was too dangerous to go inside.

My friends Max and Frank decided a year ago that we would explore the various abandoned houses around our town. We thought we were saving the best for last, but we were wrong.

After school, I met up with my friends, and we went to stay at Frank's house. We always made preparations before exploring a house: This time, we decided to take some extra gear because of what we had heard about the house. Max was not too excited about going to this house, but he was kind enough to bring his sketchpad and a video camera. Max constantly sketched exciting things we found in the homes. One time, he spent an hour drawing a couple of cases we couldn't open.

That Saturday, we got ready to head out; all our supplies were packed. We even made plans to go out to eat after. As far as Frank's mom knew, we would be out all night going camping. The plan was to be at the house for at least three hours, go out to eat, and come back with some excuse. It was not the most solid plan, but we were not thinking. As far as we knew, it would be like every other time.

The house was within walking distance. In the darkness, it seemed to loom over us. The silhouette stood out against the other houses in the area: This house had four floors and was much larger than the other houses. Getting around the fence was semi-easy. We had to hold a chain open and slip in through the gate. The grass was dead; it had been for a long time. We could hear birds around the house. I think they were crows. Frank and I could tell Max was feeling apprehensive about going inside. Frank and I had to give him a pep talk.

Once we got up the stairs, I was the first one to get the door open. We used a crowbar; I gave it back to Max before heading inside. The inside of the house had to be illuminated by our flashlights; the power was still off, at least upstairs. We took our time looking around this first room. Nothing was interestingâ€”a couch, a cracked tv, and other items you would find in a living room.

After we explored the living room, we went to check the kitchen. It was exactly as we were expecting. The furniture was in a state of disrepair, the cabinets had old canned food inside, and the fridge had old rotting food. Opening the fridge was enough to get us to clear the room. At the time, we didn't question why there was old food in the refrigerator. Now that I think about it, it was weird that rotting food was in the fridge. I know people leave things behind when they move but a ton of food and cans? I'm not so sure.

We found two bathrooms downstairs and a dining room as we looked around the house. Again, nothing was interesting to see here. Each room on the first floor was dull. Max was getting antsy; no longer was he feeling apprehensive. Now he wanted to explore the house more. At first, Frank was a little worried about going upstairs, but Max and I pushed him to head upstairs first. The stairs creaked under his weight; we moved slowly. Max told us that we were allowed to yank him out if the stairs broke so long as he didn't have to lose his leg!

The upstairs area had two bedrooms, a bathroom, and three empty rooms. The empty room had matching white walls and gross-looking white carpet. I was honestly disgusted by how the carpets looked. I put my foot inside one of the rooms and pressed on the carpet. It squished under my shoe.

"Dude, that's so gross." Max laughed. I laughed with him. We went to check out the bathroom. Next, this room smelled so bad we had to close the door. It was clear it had been used at one point. We decided not to open the door again to see what was making the smell. We swing our arms around to kill some of the flies that swarmed out of the room. My nostrils felt like they were on fire. Frank had to hold his breath, so he didn't throw up.

The main bedroom was disgusting as well. The sheets were stained with blood; they smelled like rot. There was tons of stuff in this room, but we didn't want to touch anything. Explaining to our parents where we had been all night was the easy part. There would have been hell to pay if we brought back a disease. The most notable thing about this room was the mess of items all over the floor. When people left, they didn't pack everything. We all found that odd but continued to look around anyway. Max talked about the possibility of finding something with some value to it.

The second bathroom was dark. We had to shine our flashlights in completely to see. The twin-sized bed had chains attached to the post. There was old food everywhere. Max and I backed out as fast as possible. Frank seemed fascinated. When we went back downstairs, Max announced that he was leaving. I was ready to go with him. The house was just too creepy. But we listened to Frank; I should have trusted my gut. They would still be alive if I had listened to Max in the first place.

We all decided to give the basement twenty minutes at most. Getting down there was no easy task; the stairs felt like they would give way at any moment. Unlike the rest of the house, the basement was lit. The blue lights were enough to light our way as he descended the steps. We descended into madness, into something we were not supposed to see. My gut was ripping at me, begging me to turn around. I didn't listen. As we got further into the basement, the walls began to change. No longer were they made out of wood; they were sleek now. Max tapped the wall and told us it was likely made of metal. Frank talked about how weird it was that this part of the house had power. I told Frank that it must have a generator. I could feel the hair on the back of my neck rise as we turned the first corner.

That is when we heard it for the first time, crying. Max thought it was someone in trouble. I have never seen him move so fast. He said we could help them. Frank had other ideas. He wanted to go back upstairs and call the police. But we were not leaving Max, so we chased him. The basement was like an artificial maze. It felt like we ran for hours, but really it was about fifteen minutes. Max checked each room we passed for the crying. When he opened the fifth door, the world seemed to slow down around me. It was like my mind was going in slow motion.

Max stopped moving in a blink of an eye. His body curled forward like a lawn chair. A large metal rod pierced his body. Frank screamed for Max to move. I couldn't speak; I didn't have it in me. Max's body was tossed back; he slit off of the metal rod, like butter. I could hardly breathe. Frank was frozen in place. As the person who murdered my friend turned the corner, we could see what it was. It was not a person. It was a monster. A real monster.

It stood as high as the ceiling. It had a head made of wires with a box surrounding it. It looked like a broken tv. The creature had a human chest; I could see the blood splatter sliding down its abs. Its human legs were distorted; wires were running through its flesh. The creature was human and machine. Frank ran past me, screaming. It took me a second to turn and follow him. I thought we had the upper hand. I assumed the creature was slow. I was wrong.

It ran behind us, its long legs taking easy strides. It cut down Frank like he was nothing. I watched my best friend fall forward; his body hit the floor with a loud thud. I can still hear it. I can still hear the sound of his spine being slashed.

I ran up the basement stairs as fast as I could. I didn't bother to try and be careful. When I got to the top, I turned my head for a second. The beast was looking back at me. I could see its eyes flickering. Its eyes changed color. First red, then blue, and after that, they became yellow. It did not follow me up the stairs.

I ran out of the house screaming. I screamed as loud as possible. It felt like I was dragging sandpaper through my throat. My heart threatened to explode at any moment. When I squeeze through the gate, I cut my back and arms on the metal. My mom cleaned the cuts when I got home.

See, here is the thing, no one believes me about what happened. I told them about the house, about Max and Frank. I told the truth. The police told me there was no monster in that house; they told me they never found any bodies.

I went back to Frank's house. It was empty. His parents were gone. After that, I checked Max's house and found it empty. My parents deny that I ever had friends named Max and Frank. I have been told not to talk about what happened; my mother told me to keep my crazy thoughts to myself. I could see it behind her eyes; she wanted to tell me the truth. My mom told me I should have listened to her stories about the town's history; I told her I was willing to learn.

My name is Danny. I had two best friends named Max and Frank. The rest of Larnwick is painting me as some crazy kid who did too many drugs. My parents are telling me what I saw was fake; they're telling me I am crazy. But I know the truth, and my friends will not be [forgotten](https://www.reddit.com/r/SpectralsMegaverse/collection/186d353d-7f6d-4006-aa0e-e38746123553).

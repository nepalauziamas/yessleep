We got Tommy his first smartphone on his 13th birthday. We figured out he was old enough to finally own one. After all, he was a teenager now, and it was time to give him a little more space and more time for him to hang out with his friends.

After all, I was around his age when I got my first computer.

What could possibly go wrong?

Tommy was escastic, and he spent the first few days lying on his belly and exploring. His new phone was already pre installed with some games and some basic functions like a calculator and compass. I mostly let him play around with it while I did the household chores. We didn’t have much to begin with, and this phone cost me an arm and a leg. If it made him happy, it would be totally worth it.

At first we could get him off the phone and disconnect and spend some quality time with us, like going to the zoo or to watch some of the latest blockbusters at the cinema, but as time went on he seemed to be glued to the thing. Literally couldn’t pull him away from it. I knew it would happen, but for some reason I dismissed it. Kids would be kids and all that.

Especially when he started speaking regularly to someone named Bryan.

My first thought was that he met Bryan online, so I made Tommy show me all his logs and chats of his social media accounts, so I could evaluate what kind of person he was. To my surprise though, I found nobody by that name. Of course, Internet these days, everyone is cautious about their identity and carefully conceals them behind a screen. Heck, even I am doing it right now.

But there really is no one called Bryan. It was like that person didn’t exist in his life.

Yet I remained wary. I told Tommy on no account was he to talk to Bryan ever again.

He didn’t listen.

I knew this because I caught him talking to Bryan one day in his room, when he thought he was doing it in secret. He was absolutely delighted, giggly, pouring his heart out to Bryan and telling him all of his life’s secrets.

I hit the roof. I stormed into his room and confiscated his phone. Tommy cried and wailed, but I wouldn’t budge.

I returned him his phone when the weekend was over, partially because Tommy was moping around the house and partially because I figured a weekend of grounding him from his phone was enough to teach him. Tommy said nothing when I gave it to him in the morning, though his eyes brightened up a little. He nodded in thanks and went off to school.

Or I *thought* he had gone off to school.

Around 10am I suddenly received a call from the school principal that Tommy had been missing from all of his classes, and they were worried for him.

Wild thoughts flew through my head. I just couldn’t think straight.

What if someone took him?

What if he decided to run away forever because of what I had done to him?

What if… WHAT IF…

And that burning question screaming at me in my mind, that incessant voice that was nagging away in the corners of my brain since I walked into that shop:

**Why did I even get him that stupid phone?**

*Okay* I said to myself 5 minutes later. My head was still buzzing and screaming at me, and I could feel my throat closing up. But somehow I knew panicking wouldn’t help me. Panicking wouldn’t help me find my Tommy.

*Think.*

I knew I installed a tracking device on his phone to monitor his whereabouts in case this sort of thing happened, but the app couldn’t track his phone’s location, telling me to remind him to turn it back on. I tried calling him, but he didn’t pick up. Just went straight to voicemail. Same as texts. Undelivered.

I wanted to tear my hair out.

*It’s okay, it’s okay.*

I went to look for him in all of his favourite spots, but he *wasn’t there.* I was close to hyperventilating.

*It’s okay, it’s okay. He is safe. He is safe.*

So I called the police and filed a missing person report. I spent the rest of the afternoon peering out of the window and biting down my fingernails. It was worn down now, all the way to stubs. I couldn’t focus on anything else. Pictures of him tied up and gagged were flashing through my mind.

And sometimes then I fell asleep after sitting there too long, and I was plagued by nightmares: a sinister figure by the name of Bryan, with a grin showing all his teeth and my boy in a giant shadowy hand, while the other ran a knife down his throat. The only colour in the dream was how red his blood was. I kept on staring at it.

I was jolted awake by the phone ringing.It was the police department.

They had finally found my Tommy.

They handed Tommy over without a word and we drove home in silence. Once at home I held out my hand and Tommy gave me the phone. The way my brows furrowed and my shoulders stiffened told him all he needed to know.

Then he disappeared into his room and was quiet the rest of the evening.

I spent the following weeks trying to destroy the phone. Call it drastic, but I was desperate. I didn’t want this Bryan to call my Tommy ever again. I didn’t want him to get hurt.

I did everything I could. Smashed the glass with a hammer, threw it out of the window, even took it to a shop to disassemble it. However, to put it simply, that phone was indestructible. The glass was shiny and smooth; the phone was always in perfect working condition.

Furthermore it seemed to fight back. I did everything I could to keep that phone away from Tommy, but I would wake up in the morning to loud giggles and his eyes glued to the screen and the phone disappearing from my locked safe. Talking to Bryan, yet I never saw his face or heard his voice. The cool black screen smirked back at me every day.

In the end I made up my mind to sell it. I glared at that phone, determined to win the war.

At 3am I woke up to loud giggles that had seeped into my dreams.

The moon shone lightly through the window, illuminating what looked like a crime scene.

The room was a complete mess. Drawers were ripped open and emptied, and clothes were flung everywhere. The window was smashed open, shards of glass shattered all over the floor.

The safe was lying on its side at the foot of my bed. Someone had smashed a phone-shaped hole through the safe and liquid metal was oozing out to the crevices of the floor.

What chilled me to the bone though, were little bloody footprints, trotting out from the safe and out the door. More blood was splattered all over the floor and onto the walls, painting them a gnarly crimson.

Hardly daring to breathe, I followed the footprints and the giggles, which both came from Tommy’s room. My heart was in my throat as I desperately prayed—*please*—that Bryan did not find our house, that Bryan did nothing to my son, that Tommy, oh *Tommy!* would be all right…

What I had found was so much worse.

The darkness opened up to a room so bright it hurt to look. It was 3am on a Thursday evening with school tomorrow, and my son was on his phone.

Tommy was facing away from me, and I could hear him laughing merrily away. I called his name, my voice quavering, my throat choked up in fear.

He turned round, and I wanted to scream so bad but my voice was stuck in my throat.

His head was perilously perched onto the phone, and his limbs wiggled like they were brand-new.

“Hi mum!” said the phone, and I could see a pair of perfectly round eyeballs and a mouth glued to the screen. It giggled, and I realised the voice I had heard the entire time wasn’t ‘Bryan’s’, but Tommy’s—twisted and distorted until I could barely recognise it.

Tommy chuckled again, like all this was some kind of sick joke that I never would understand.

“Bryan taught me how to be with him forever! Isn’t that nice!”

The colour drained from my face. I had no idea what to say. Tommy laughed some more, laughed as his body folded into itself, laughed as his limbs and eyes and mouth and what was left of him pixelated and dissolved, until the phone fell onto his bed with a soft thump, quiet once more.

I immediately threw the phone into the garbage can, kicking myself for not doing it sooner.

But as I opened the door again, there was my own phone, sitting on the table where I could see it. It was odd because the last time I saw my phone it was charging quietly on the floor just outside my room.

And it started to ring, the screen still black as the deepest pits of hell.

Then it answered itself, and I heard Tommy’s voice again, only it was coming out all wrong.

“Hi mum.”

His eyes and mouth opened on the still-black screen.

“I miss you already.”

Blood was dripping from the speakers. He was laughing again.

That’s what it says: FUCK ME.

Black serifed font, embossed on a thick cream card. Premium stock.

FUCK ME.

No name, no address, no watermark. It lies on our carpet, uninvited, suggestive, like skin exposed as a dress slips off the shoulder.

Posted through our door at some point in the night, and left for us in the morning.

It makes no sense. It’s obscene.

“Are you having an affair?” my wife asks.

“No, are you?”

She shakes her head. “I don’t think the card’s meant for me, honey.”

“Well it’s not meant for me.”

She pauses. I make a good point.

“I’ll throw it in the bin” I say, making my way to the kitchen.

I don't, of course. Slip it in my wallet instead, just in case.

In case of what? I’m not sure. In case, I guess, I need it.

&#x200B;

**BILLBOARD:**

I’m driving to work the next morning and there it is. Proud, exposed above the freeway. Hundreds, thousands of cars driving right under it. A billboard, entirely white, except for two words.

Black, serifed font.

FUCK ME.

I tell my wife I saw it above the freeway, that it must be a joke, that whoever did it to us probably did it to everyone else in the neighborhood and then some, that they’ve hired a whole billboard, would you believe it, a whole billboard.

She doesn’t believe it. Says it sounds stupid, that she’s bored of the game now.

“There’s no game” I reply. “There’s no game, or, if there is - we’re not the only players.”

“We’re not players at all, honey.”

“Right, but if there was a game, we would be.”

“Sure. I guess”

“Right.”

&#x200B;

**ADVERT:**

I’m watching TV. Can’t sleep, half-finished beer by my feet. The programs all become the same, all blurred into one, flicking through the channels, catching five minutes at a time.

Too tired to change it now, resigned to watching the ads.

A handsome man appears on screen, muscular, tanned, his white T-shirt is pulled tight and hugs him when he moves.

He leans forward, his teeth a picture-perfect whiter-than-white toothpaste smile and he says, into the camera:

“SMILERITE is my favourite toothpaste. Always has been, always will be.”

He licks his teeth, looks around as if checking if people can hear, and then turns back, looks me dead in the eye, and speaks again, slower:

“FUCK ME.”

&#x200B;

**BANK:**

The teller looks around: no one else in the queue. Leans forward. A tattoo begins just on the exposed skin by her collar: ink-black, white froth of waves, the implication of a boat.

“And, Sir, after you’ve deposited the agreed upon amount, would you be so kind as to fuck me?”

“Sorry?”

“Sorry, Sir. I should have been much clearer: FUCK ME. I was wondering if you would like to fuck me.”

My throat grows tight, I stammer out a no, loosen my tie. Tell her I don’t know what she means, why she’s saying this, and as I do so her jaw shakes, she wipes her mouth, the back of her hand is red with blood.

Can someone just say that?

She’s bleeding from her mouth, I think. Standing there, perfect customer-service smile, but there’s blood leaking from between her teeth and pooling under her lip. Some of it dribbles onto the desk, and I think it sounds like a broken gutter.

Can someone just say something like that in everyday life and people just do nothing?

&#x200B;

**FOOTAGE FROM A MURDER:**

A VHS comes through the door, titled FUCK ME.

I want to throw it away immediately but something takes over. I haven’t seen a VHS in years, and I can’t help but want to know more. I set it up in the attic, plug our VHS machine into a small television set, sit and watch the video whilst holding my breath.

It opens with both a man and a woman dressed in these strange clothes, black cloth sacks over their heads. The woman’s like a cheap parody of a princess, the fake material has a plastic sheen, the pink reminds me of old toys; little cars discarded on the side of the road.

The man’s wearing a striped shirt with a little anchor on it. Some sort of sailor.

The bags are pulled off their heads. They are young, attractive. The woman's forehead is dewed with sweat, and she glows. The man has a strong jaw, stubble, darts his tongue out to wet his lips. I guess mid-twenties, maybe a little older.

A figure in a mask walks in, corrects their posture, then, slowly, kisses each of them on the forehead.

They smile: cherubic, blissed out.

“Any last words?”

His voice is run through some sort of machine, some sort of distortion applied and it sounds deep, makes me think of old internet videos, of people who want to stay hidden.

They both say it, in unison, smiling perfect smiles, teeth white and straight, pretty squares set in pink gums.

“FUCK ME.”

Two short noises, and the acoustics of the small room muffle them.

They both jerk backwards.

Two small red holes in their foreheads. Blood splatters the wall behind. They collapse. Dead.

The figure comes back into frame, strange mask, stoop, and pulls the bodies out of shot. He takes a small bow, and, from somewhere in the background, there is a round of applause.

&#x200B;

**SONG:**

A new song comes on the radio. FUCK ME, is the chorus, those two words over tight cymbals, distorted bass. It doesn’t play often, but gets people talking.

We host a dinner party with old friends: wine, our best cutlery, steamed vegetables and rare meat. I bring up the song, ask if they’ve heard it. They nod.

“It’s about me.”

They laugh.

“Right, sure. It’s about *you*. It’s trying to be edgy, that’s all. They’re seeing what they can get away with.”

My wife speaks up:

“I don’t like it. It’s too obvious - it beats you over the head. Like, we get it? I don’t know, maybe I’m getting old. There’s no subtlety-”

I interrupt.

“It’s not edgy, it’s about me. The song is about me. They want me to fuck them, I don’t know, to kill them, to buy whatever they’re selling and then kill them-”

They shake their heads.

In unison: “right.”

I watch the music video in bed, the singers: a young woman, dressed like a princess, a young man, dressed like a sailor. The costumes are purposely tacky, ill-fitting. I guess they’re mid-twenties. They have this glazed look in their eye, like they’ve just seen a car crash or an act of violence and it won’t stop playing on the walls of their skulls.

I’m watching the video on repeat now, when it clicks. My stomach turns, contracts into itself, the space between my tongue and my gums dries.

I try to rewatch the VHS, having to rewire the whole thing again, sitting in my boxers, belly hanging over the waistband.

I click play.

It’s gone.

The video’s gone.

And in its place, occasionally rippling with the streaks of static present on old videos, two words:

FUCK ME.

&#x200B;

**HOUSE:**

Sometimes I think I can hear noises outside our house. Like people are walking in our garden, running their hands along our walls. I find it hard to sleep, imagining these people, whoever they are, touching my house, their fingers on the woodgrain of our shed, feet dirty with our mud.

I think I can see them. When I look from my bedroom window, or the kitchen window at night, I can see them. Standing naked. Wearing masks, bodies exposed. Exposed in that way that’s so earnest it verges on scientific, just limbs and throats and stomachs, sagging or uneven or pulled tight over bones.

I think they are looking for me.

I don’t tell my wife. I don’t think she’d believe me.

Some have tattoos: a snake, a tiger, an ocean.

As I watch them watch me one of them bends over, heaves, vomits something black and viscous onto the street outside. Wipes their mouth with the back of their hand.

Continues staring.

Mouths the words with their lips stained black: FUCK ME.

The liquid’s gone by morning.

&#x200B;

**BOAT:**

I drive to the ocean, to take a break, tell work I’m sick.

Take a long walk along the coast, breathing in the seaspray, the salt that hangs in the air. I can taste it on my skin, like I’m being lightly seasoned.

I see a boat, moored to the pier I’m walking down, drifting, tugging the rope that keeps it there, with the windows smashed. The other boats are still, empty. I decide to investigate, drawing a little closer, trying to see what’s going on. A figure, slouched in the front seat, the floor slick with blood.

I shout to ask if they’re okay.

Nothing.

“What happened here? Should I call for help?”

Nothing.

The boat bobs aimlessly, as if lost for words.

I step on board.

My heart’s beating faster now. I don’t know what I’m getting myself into, who they are, whether they’re hurt or even, god forbid, dead, or-

They cough.

Flecks of blood on the windscreen.

Face caved in, swollen, broken in places I didn’t know it could break: all red and purple and blue. One eye puffed out, one eye forced closed. Dentures sitting in clear water in a glass on the dashboard.

They’re trying to say something. I lean in, putting a hand on their shoulder, trying to reassure them, saying that I’ll call the police as soon as I can, that I’ll get an ambulance - shit - two ambulances if they need it, and then I see what their mouth is trying to do.

Lips straining inward.

The flaccid sound of an *f.*

*ffff*

I know what comes next.

“Don’t say it.”

They keep going, the sound of air escaping making blood bubble from between their lips.

*ffffff*

“Shut up.”

My voice is growing louder. I notice the ballpoint hammer on the floor by their feet, I imagine taking it to them. I don’t want to hear those two words.

They keep going, the blood getting thicker, bubbles bigger, colour changing. Black liquid now running down their chin, and they’re still trying to say it.

I leave.

Let them say it, who cares. I think about calling the police, calling an ambulance. Decide against it.

I’m still on the boat when I see it. The other boat moored to the pier, populated by a dozen or so naked people, all wearing the same masks, watching in impassive silence. Like a painting, I think, the way their skin stands out against the sea. I want to shout at them but it catches in my throat.

The tallest one raises a glass to me, and nods, like he’s recognised an old friend.

I vomit into the froth, the sea moves quickly, and I don’t stop to see what colour it is.

The drive back takes longer than expected: someone has hung themselves from the bridge across the motorway, naked, put a bag over their head. Graffiti’d by the rope: FUCK ME.

I don’t see this, I hear it, on the radio. They dance around what it actually says for a while, trying to avoid using those words, *imply* them, don’t say them.

An ad for SMILERITE plays, tells me that I should smile right whatever the occasion, that I never know who might see it. I think of the face under the hood; swollen, tongue hanging out, a perfect smile hidden.

&#x200B;

**CLIMAX:**

A call wakes me up in the middle of the night. The voice is modulated, deep. Gives me an address. Tells me to bring my card.

“What card?”

No response.

“Who is this?”

They hang up.

I’m left in cold sweats. I don’t sleep any more that night, stay staring at the ceiling until the sun rises and casts limp shadows across our room.

I try and distract myself during the day. I try to watch TV, but the ads leer at me, I consider taking a drive but I can’t stop thinking about the boat, about the body and about the way it made me retch. I have no choice.

Night falls. The moon hangs pink in the sky, like some cosmic peep show. I think about what’s changing on the other side, what wants us to only see flashes of itself.

I try to find my wife to tell her where I’m going but she’s nowhere to be found. I drive to the address. It’s an old, gothic mansion: so huge I can’t see the back of it, as if it continues on forever into the dark. I stay in my car, drumming my fingers on the steering wheel.

I can’t wait any longer. I have to go in. I have to see for myself.

The walk takes a minute or two, and the thin path is lit on both sides by tall wooden torches, open flames. They spit slightly, little embers floating skywards. I brace myself.

The woman at the door is naked, save for a black cloth sack over her head, with a small hole cut for her mouth. She smiles as I approach. I can see the sweat on her chest glisten, the white of her teeth as she smiles. She makes a gesture like unbuttoning a shirt, and I understand.

*Of course.*

I strip naked, taking a moment to look at my body before entering. I step up, ask if I need a sack. She shakes her head.

“Not you.”

The hall smells of bodies, of sweat, of incense and wine and smoke, of fruit and hay and coal. I make my way through. The whole hall is packed with people wearing the same mask, completely naked. They nod as I walk past, momentarily distracted from their conversations. They’re drinking wine, white teeth stained red.

Every single person wears the same thing, like some perverse uniform: exposed body, black cloth sack.

Everyone but me.

I keep walking down the vast hallway, under chandeliers, past body after body, all shapes and sizes, I am aroused and sickened and curious and I have to keep going.

Doorways are open either side of me, allowing me to see in, making me a voyeur, a witness to these small madnesses: a old-fashioned cinema, filled entirely with naked bodies with sack-cloth heads, watching TV static being projected onto a wall; a room full of people sat cross-legged around a cow holding hands and singing; a room that’s only filled with a giant and dead tree and in its branches are dozens of people crouched like strange birds, eating these red red apples; a room where they seem to be sitting an exam, rows after rows of tables, but the floor is covered in a sea of rats; hand-woven slipknots; men and women singing and fucking and fighting and swearing and weeping-

I come to the end of the hallway.

The next room, the room ahead of me, the room that has two gilded doors that creak open as I push them, is the biggest yet.

It is vast, tables upon tables filled with people, these naked bodies, these strange black sacks. There are rows of seats behind, several levels - thousands upon thousands of people who stay still as I enter. I think of a colosseum, of men and women condemned to die on the sand, of the vast and sweeping rows of seats.

I can feel the impulse work its way up my spine.

I make my way to the stage.

I know what I’m going to do, what I *have* to do.

I think, for a moment, I recognise a body, the curve of my wife’s hips, the small of her back.

Too late now.

As I arrive on stage there is a brief, polite round of applause.

I stand, naked, before them all. The only face visible in the whole room. I feel as if I am at sea, as if the earth beneath me is rocking from side to side.

I step forward: tap the microphone.

The noise echoes around the room, a muted boom.

Clear my throat.

Take a breath.

Lean in.

Two words, loud and clear.

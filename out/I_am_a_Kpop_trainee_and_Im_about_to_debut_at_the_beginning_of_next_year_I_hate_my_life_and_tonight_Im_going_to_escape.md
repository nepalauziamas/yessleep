I may struggle writing this. I just cut the tag out of my neck. There’s no blood, no pain—but I like to pretend it hurts.

….


Hi, my name is Mia. I’m a Kpop trainee.

I am 22 years old, born and raised in Cairns, Australia while my family are originally from South Korea.

I guess I’ll just start telling you things about me so I can get used to writing. (This is the first time I’m using a phone in a while, so please bear with me).

I am a Leo, I like dogs more than cats, I hate pizza crust and the smell of petrichor is the only thing which calms me.

I was bullied in primary school for “having a weird face” and no kids elaborating because they weren’t sure why.

Why? Why was my face weird?

They had no idea. They just pointed and laughed because I didn’t look like them.

I didn’t understand at the time but as I grew up, I slowly started to realise.

Ignorant parents raise even more ignorant children.

This isn’t the story behind my childhood bullying or the blatant racism I received growing up in Australia.

I want to tell you about what came after that—and what led me here.

Tonight, I am going to escape.

Home, maybe.

No. They’ll catch me if I go home.

I think someplace else—where I know they won’t follow me.

Right underneath my feet.

Not now, or in seconds, minutes, hours to come—maybe not until the sun comes up and dawn lights up the horizon.

I guess right now is the best time. Under a full moon and the shadow of Seoul Tower lit up in the distance. That is what my manager would say, whispering into my ear. Just like she used to tell me exactly how many glasses of water I could have a day, and that if I put on weight, I was disgusting. However, I will decide when I take my own life. Because it is my choice.

Not my manager’s, or the company, or the other’s in our group. I will be the one to do it because it is my choice. They can’t take that away from me. They won’t. After taking everything else they will never take away my ability to choose again.

I’m finally free and yet I still can’t bring myself to choose simple things—like my brain has been rewired not to think. 

I wonder if my manager had the chance, would she send me plunging down, down, down?

Jung-Gu looks beautiful from up here; a whole district lit up in endless night.  I wish I could appreciate it more, but I can’t.

I wish I could smile or laugh or even cry because I miss home. But all I can do is marvel at the world slowly moving beneath me.

Even in the dead of night people are still thriving, either going to night school or coming home from work. I’ve spent the last few hours sitting here watching cars and imagining each person’s story. 

But they’re all happier than mine. These people have choices to make. They decide when they wake up, and what they are going to eat—what they will wear and how people will perceive them. They decide what friends they will make. If they’re going to be an asshole today or smile through razor blades in their throat. 

The idea of all these people making simple choices which affected their day-to-day lives makes me feel kind of sick.

Not sick in a nauseous way. Sick in a longing—a longing so powerful, so painful, it’s driving me fucking crazy. I didn’t even think those kinds of thoughts still existed inside me until they led me here to the edge of my balcony. So close to falling.

But I don’t want to fall yet.

I want to tell you the truth behind being an idol. I’m sure you’ve heard the good and bad sides. Yes, you could be catapulted into worldwide stardom and be the centre of every teenager’s fantasy. But there’s also the not so great side which isn’t exactly a secret to the general public. 

You work your ass off for cash that’s not even going in your pocket—your meals (if they decide to feed you) are barely enough sustenance to keep you going, and your life is no longer yours; instead, literally anyone else’s. The faceless CEO barking orders at you through management, the girl working in the store replaying all your songs on her Spotify and obsessing over you on social media, the kid with your posters on his wall and yet will not stop flooding your messages with hateful comments and violent death threats. Yep. You get all of it. And all you have to do is lose yourself.

People say you have to make some kind of contract or sell your soul to the devil to get this type of gig.

I hate to break it to you, but that’s shit ain’t real.

Not in this reality, anyway.

We don’t sell our souls in this industry.

We sell our bodies.

I was like you. The one reading this. I saw acts like NCT-127 and Black Pink getting huge, both of whom have English speaking Korean idols, and I thought I had a chance. It’s not like I thought, “Yes, I want to be an idol” but the idea was appealing.

Worldwide stardom? Yes.

Millions of fans? Yes.

Who wouldn’t want it?

Statistically, there is a 0.001% chance that you will make it as an idol.

I just made that up, but the odds are pretty low. I see YouTube videos of trainees describe the whole auditioning process as this huge ordeal, but I guess I was lucky. The studio I am under were searching for English speaking performers “of SEA descent” (The ad’s words, not mine) to create a multi-sex super-group. 

The thing is none of us initially auditioned or even signed up for it. I couldn’t even sing. None of us. Initially, anyway. One thing we all had in common was a YouTube account, and we were all studying in Korea. I vlogged my college days, as well as plant reviews and my holiday’s back in Cairns when I was visiting friends and family in the summer. 

The point is, I never sang or danced in, or performed any act which could be seen as a talent. I’m not the only one. Fee, a guy in our group—he did poetry readings in both English and Korean.

Sara did makeup tutorials, and Jason pulled pranks on his roommates. None of us sang or danced or did anything remotely eye-catching and yet we all ended up in the same place, a shady looking building on the outskirts of Hongdae, which is close to our university. 

The four of us all received the same email with a date, a time, and an offer of a lifetime from a studio in every controversial headline you can think of. 

So, naturally I thought it was bullshit. As soon as I saw the name of the studio, I made a scoffing noise and swiftly deleted it. Five minutes later, though, there it was again, sitting in my inbox like a stubborn kid. This time there were more official details, a summary of why I had been chosen, and an invite to meet them.

I couldn’t ignore that.

So, yeah, using Google Maps on my phone, I found probably the shadiest looking building I had ever seen—and was surprised when the name of said-studio was plastered on automatic doors which had been covered in graffiti. 

The build itself on the outside looked like the kind of place you would hold someone hostage, crumbling brick and ivy crawling up the walls, a door which had to be kicked several times to let you in, and a resident rat hiding behind the trash can at the back. 

The interior, however, was like walking inside a 5 star hotel. That made me wonder if this particular studio was used to avoid crazy fans. I walked in and was automatically blasted with air-con and hit with the aroma of lemon and something flowery dancing in the air. 

On the walls were photo’s of various idol alumni, and I had a “is this really happening to me?” moment. 

The receptionist pointed me down the hall without speaking, and I was glad because despite being half Korean, living in Australia for most of my life, I had ignored my culture, as well as my mother’s attempts to teach it fully. I knew more than the basics, but I  definitely was not fluent enough to have a conversation where I was completely confident. 

Google Translate was a life saver—as well as the Korean lessons I was taking every Friday morning after class. 

Sorry. I think I’m going on a tangent.

I think finally being able to write what I am feeling, I can’t seem to stop.

I didn't know it at that point, but those three would become my family. Pigtails was Sara, originally from California, with a Thai family. The guy leaning against the door, knocking his head against wood was Fee, from New Zealand with a Korean father and a Kiwi mum, and finally, Jason, Korean born and raised in New York. With the strongest Boston accent I'd ever heard.

He had his eyes closed, vibing to whatever music he was listening to. After talking for a while, we concluded that none of us had any idea why we were there, and we stuck out like a sore thumb. 

Every so often the doors to other rooms opened, trainee's rushing out in groups, talking in a mix of Korean and English. Mostly Korean. We did manage to narrow it down to our YouTube channels. 

But neither of us sang or danced, so we were stumped. 

Eventually, we got our answer when a smartly dressed woman unlocked the door and ushered us inside with a strict smile. She seemed friendly enough, but there was also a no-nonsense aura around her. The woman introduced herself as Binna, and then revealed we had been chosen as a “test run” for a multi-sex group. 

When Sara told her she couldn’t sing, and Fee piped up with “I can’t dance for shit” the woman pursed her lips and promised us that by the end of our training, we would bite those words back. I wasn’t sure about that. Binna told us we were going to begin living together in an apartment near the studio, and we would each be put through months of brutal and gruelling training to turn us into trainee’s worth looking at. That kind of stung, but I wasn’t a stranger to the techniques used by agency’s to make idols. I knew all about the pathetic diets and horrific abuse behind the scenes.

Truth be told, I wasn’t sure if I wanted to put myself through that. But I don’t think I had a choice. Binna spoke with phrases like “you will” and “you have to” with no hint of “can” or “if you want to”. 

The woman didn’t hold back, demanding to know our weight and height, and when neither of us knew, she said we would be appropriately weighed and measured the next day. When Fee asked why we had been chosen over others, she simply put it down to attractive features. And being fluent in English in Korea was the cherry on top. So basically, just be pretty. 

You don’t need to sing or dance—or have any talent at all. Just have a pretty face.

At that point it was obvious she wasn’t going to take no for an answer.

When Sara asked what would happen with college, she said it was on hold—and didn’t elaborate. Binna asked us to individually perform a routine to the best of our ability so she could grade us on our singing and dancing skills, and as expected, none of us delivered anything what would be on par with what she was looking for. Still though, we had our strengths, if you could call them that. 

Sara couldn’t dance well, but she could rap to a beat. Fee was our best dancer but sucked at singing high notes, and Jason was just bad in general. Binna’s lips twitched all the way through his performance, and one point I thought she was going to walk out. I thought for sure she would give up on us. We knew it and she knew it.

We were ass. No person with working braincells would put energy into turning us into something tolerable. You can’t make diamonds out of glass bottles, and we were shattered beyond mending.

Binna introduced herself as our manager and trainer at the end of the session, gave us a bottle of water, and told us to head to our new apartment. Apparently, our stuff had already been transferred to our rooms. 

I wasn’t going to question it though, I was exhausted from putting my body into strenuous amounts of exercise without eating or even drinking. Binna expected us at the studio for a 6am start, and her words didn’t really hit me until I stepped out into the cool night air which felt amazing on my clammy skin.

I pulled my phone out to call my mom, but when I pressed it to my ear, it was snatched from my hand.

“No phones allowed during training.” Binna said in Korean, and then English. She waved my phone. “Distraction.”

“I need to call my mum.” I said, and when she frowned, I repeated it in mostly broken Korean.

The woman just shook her head and made a remark that she would organise Korean lessons for me ASAP.

I opened my mouth to protest, but she had already ducked back into the studio, heading towards the vending machine.

By the time I’d reached our apartment, which was in the middle of nowhere, I was ready to sleep for 3 days. The place itself wasn’t special, but it was good enough; a modern studio apartment on the top floor of a skyscraper my brain was too mushy to know the name of. I know what you’re thinking. I’m privileged to think that when poverty exists. And you're right. But I’d like you to imagine sharing a shoe-box apartment with three other grown adults. 

The apartment was beautiful and modern with rustic colors, and everything about it screamed luxury. We were on the top floor with a breath-taking view of Seoul and the surrounding districts. 

But it only had two rooms. Two beds. It wasn’t a huge problem at the start. We were too tired to argue over beds and living arrangements, so Sara and I shared one room, while the guy’s took the other. 

I remember going to sleep that first night and remembering that I had only eaten a cereal bar all day. And when I really thought about it, my stomach caught up to my brain. I was starving, a gnawing, painful hunger eating me up inside.  And there was no food in the apartment.

Where was the closest 7/11?

I didn’t even know the area, but there had to be one somewhere.

As I was thinking that, though, the very thought drifted away, and I was lulled to an uncertain sleep by Sara’s soft snores.

Waking up the next day was torture.

It wasn’t just that things like privacy no longer existed when living in an apartment the size of a prison cell, it was the 6am start, the fact that none of us could find any food, and that Binna was knocking on our door expecting us dressed and at the studio at 6:20. I remember feeling sick to my stomach, so hungry, and that hunger was driving me to shower faster, getting soap in my eyes, and throw on any clothes I could blindly grasp.

It’s not easy when three others are running around the apartment. I realised that morning that I’d come to notice the other’s quirks. Jason was the human embodiment of panic, seemingly traumatised by Binna, Sara spoke fluent Thai when she was pissed or tired—and Fee wasn’t a morning person, meaning he just stood there or aimlessly walked around shirtless without a care in the world and half a bottle of water.

So, naturally, these different personalities and quirks clashed. It wasn’t easy at first. We were constantly training so we never had time to socialise, but when we did manage to, we started to open up to each other slowly. I learned little things as training days went by in a blur. 

Jason was from a strict family, so it had been sort of knocked into him from a young age that he had to work to his best ability, especially when someone saw potential. Sara was openly gay but scared to come out in a country like Korea, which hasn’t quite caught up to the west in terms of equality—and Fee was only here because he followed a girl he’d fallen in love with, only for her to dump him three months into the relationship and left him stranded here.

I guess just talking to each other was all we could do when we were too tired to do anything else.

As for training, I wouldn’t say we were getting better, but a spark was starting to form. Sara became progressively better at rapping, and slowly we started to find our places in the group. Jason and Sara were up front doing main vocals, and Fee and I did backup vocals and the main choreography. I thought I couldn’t dance. 

I thought I was hopeless. But after countless sessions both with the others and on my own, forcing my body and going above and beyond my ability, as well as Binna’s frustrated yelling when I made a mistake, her obsession with pushing me to my limit until I felt like I couldn’t breathe.

I got better.

It didn’t come like a miracle, like one day I woke up and I could dance.

It came after almost killing myself to do better. Work better.

Binna had arranged for us to be put in front of some faceless CEO’s and we were supposed to impress them.

To give them a reason to green-light this multi-sex group project.

We were taken to another bigger studio every Monday, and individually we were given singing lessons.

Then dancing lessons.

Binna weighed us every day, and despite us sticking to our diet of chicken breast and lettuce for every meal, as well as glass of water and nothing else, somehow, we were putting on weight. Sara was first, and to my shock, Binna slapped her across the face and the crack of skin against skin made cringe.

It didn’t make sense. Sara herself had already admitted to having body dysmorphia, so she was obsessed with what she ate. Sometimes Fee had to force her to eat. So, how was she putting on weight? Jason received the same treatment, and then Fee. 

Binna was fuming, but I couldn’t understand how. The four of us were in no way unhealthy, so why was she obsessed with our weight? We had followed her military regime, sticking to her ridiculous diet of only eating twice a day and taking laxatives after to flush everything out while “satisfying our hunger” as well as exercising for two hours before training and after. It was agonising. 

I was constantly hungry and under our manager’s strict glare I couldn’t even sneak a cereal bar. She would know. So, I kept to it. I ate chicken and lettuce and revelled in every bite. When I stepped onto the scale, however, and Binna screwed up her face like she’d bit into a lemon, I wanted to cry.

“This is unacceptable.” Binna, this time, spoke in Korean.

She folded her arms. “You’re due to go in front of the higher ups in two weeks and you can’t even stick to a diet.”

“What?” Jason spluttered like he was going to start yelling, but Fee nudged him to shut up.

If he spoke, if any of us spoke out of turn, we trained until we collapsed. The three of us already knew that, after Sara broke down maybe a week earlier. 

She demanded for her phone to ring her parents, and in retaliation, we had to go over our routine until the early hours of the morning—which ended in the inevitable when four twenty year olds with empty stomachs who had been up since 6am—we collapsed. And still, Binna expected us to go home and get four hours of sleep only to come back to the studio and do it all again. Since then, we knew to not speak out of turn, question authority or even dare to cry.

Binna paced up and down our small line. She was fuming.

“Do you want to make a fool out of yourselves?” She yelled, “You’re disgusting! Look at you!”

The woman grabbed Sara and shook the girl, stabbing at her stomach with a pointed fingernail. “What have you been eating?”

Sara didn’t reply, her eyes filling with tears.

Binna’s gaze snapped to all of us. “All of you! What have you been eating? I want to know.”

When none of us spoke, she hissed out. “Now!”

“Chicken and lettuce.” Fee said stiffly. When Binna came to stand in front of him, he straightened up, holding his head high.

He slumped his shoulders once during training and Binna threw a water bottle at his head.

Binna laughed at his response. “Then why are you all so fat?”

I caught Sara wince, and I itched to grab her hand. Binna didn’t have a filter. She said exactly what was on her mind.

When none of us answered, our manager cleared her throat and took something out of her pocket and held it up.

She turned to face us almost robotically. “Your performance is in a week.” She said, “I was planning to give this to you once you have impressed the higher ups. However, I’ve come to the decision that this will help you prepare for your final test.”

At first, I didn’t know what she was talking about. When I followed Fee’s gaze, I glimpsed something pinched between her thumb and index. Some kind of capsule. 

“We call it Shelling.” Binna explained. “When our trainee’s cannot maintain strict dietary requirements, they are required to go through the process of Shelling, which empties and purifies your body.”

“Is it like a Global thing?” Fee asked, raising a brow.

“It is not.” Binna said. “Shelling is only used within the confines of our company.”

Sara nodded eagerly, to my surprise. “So, it’s like a laxative?”

Binna hummed. “Yes. It works like a laxative. Shelling is a last ditch effort to get our trainee’s into their best shape.”

Jason wasn’t trying to hide his disgust. “Do we, uh—do have to take it?”

Our manager turned on him, a scowl curving on her lips. “Do you want to be in perfect shape in body and mind, Jason?”

“Well, yeah, But—”

“Good. Shelling is the best way.”

I couldn’t help speaking up. “Why is it called Shelling?”

Binna didn’t answer. “You have been training for months for a chance to rival some of our biggest super stars. Do you want to become an idol or not?”

Yes.

The word had been slammed into me. After so many sleepless nights, endless training and throwing up dust…

Yes. Of course I didn’t want it to be all for nothing.

“Exactly.” As if Binna had read my mind, she handed me a capsule.

She didn’t watch me take it, but I wasn’t going to take any chances. If I gained weight, I’d ruin it for all of us.

It tasted like raspberries.

Jason slipped his into his mouth with a scoff, and Fee swallowed his with a mouthful of water.

Sara nudged me with a smile. “Doesn’t it taste good?”

I could only manage a weak nod.

To my surprise, the capsule didn’t work like a laxative after all. We trained all night, and I didn’t have to go to the bathroom once. The taste of raspberry lingered on my tongue, though, and it only made me hungrier. At midnight the others went back to our apartment, and I stayed behind to work on the routine.

It was easier on my own. I loved Jason, but when he was in the zone, sometimes his arm would fly out and hit me in the face, and Sara’s rapping, after hearing it all day every day, had started to get on my nerves. With the studio to myself, I planned to train until 2am and then head home and sleep.

Halfway through training, though, I started to get cramps. Bad cramps.

I was already taking a pill to stop my periods, so it wasn’t that. It was something else, a pain I didn’t know or understand rumbling in my gut. I swigged water but it didn’t help. I lay on my back and closed my eyes, but it only got worse. 

Normally when I got stomach pains, I noted everything I ate to see if food poisoning was a possibility. 

But after Binna’s outburst, none of us had eaten. Binna didn’t say “you can’t eat” but she did make a face when Jason announced he was hungry, or Fee inched near the vending machine near the door. None of wanted to risk it. Eating equaled weight, and according to Binna, weight equaled failure. The only thing I’d eaten was the capsule. When that thought came to mind, something twisted in my gut. 

My mouth watered and knew exactly what that feeling was. But it was different to any other time I’d thrown up—this time it felt like there was so much. 

So much in my gut. So much to let out. Slapping a hand over my mouth, I left the studio in a panic, my vision feathering. I was half aware of bumping into two girls on the way to the bathroom, their laughter rattling in my skull. The two of them spoke Korean, but even in my state I still heard the word “shelling” between them.

Once I was in the bathroom, I bent over the toilet, and I waited. But what was I going to throw up, the capsule?

I hadn’t eaten!

My stomach heaved, and then my body; I was going hot and cold, and then boiling and freezing. I shivered and sobbed and screamed in frustration. It was like my body was refusing no matter how much it also wanted to throw up every morsel in my gut. When my head started to spin, I gave up and stuck my fingers down my throat which triggered something warm creeping up my throat. 

More pain struck-- lightning bolts striking my gut and chest and back and head. Relentless pain until I was screeching. My hands went to my gut and felt something—moving, writhing under my flesh. I jumped up, blindly reaching for anything to get them out-- to cut them out. I had to get them out. I had to get them out. I had to get them out.

Squeezing my eyes shut, I cried out for Binna.

For Jason, Sara, and Fee.

But they felt so far away, while I was trapped in my own personal hell.

When the front of head smashed against the toilet seat, I knew I wanted to die.

I would rather die.

And when I was considering doing just that, slamming my head again and again and again against anything with a hard enough surface, my mouth filled with something. It was hot and wet and slithery dripping from my lips and slithering down my chin. Finally. I bent over and allowed my body to empty itself out. I didn’t know what I was throwing up, maybe bile or food that I’d eaten in my sleep. I just know that it felt so… good. My body stopped burning and freezing, my limbs trembling, my head pounding. The pain in my gut was gone, replaced with a feeling of… emptiness. I revelled in it, unable to stop myself.

I laughed, spluttering on my own barf. I laughed into the same air I’d been sucking in and choking on for what felt like hours.

I think I fell asleep at points, or maybe I just passed out.

And even then, I could feel my body changing, twisting, and contorting.

Burning.

Freezing.

When the worst of it was over, I could barely move. I opened my eyes and stared down into the toilet bowl. At first, I didn’t fully register what I was seeing in both the toilet and around me. In my foggy state, I had failed to realise I was covered in something warm, my bare legs knelt in something pooling on cool marble. I was sure the stall I’d been in had been white.

I remembered pressing my head against pristine white tiles and praying to throw up. But when I looked around, blinking rapidly, I only saw red. I saw the deepest, darkest shade of red I had ever seen. 

It was all over me, splattering my clothes and tainting my skin. It was on my face, on my arms and my neck. When I turned to the toilet bowl, it was overfilling, spilling over with that same shade.

It only took me seeing lumps in that red—lumps which were bigger than they should be, and then fully drinking in that sudden empty cavern inside me, for me to realise what I had just thrown up.

I think at that point anyone else would have screamed or fainted or thrown up again. But those feelings no longer existed inside me. I knew they were brewing, they wanted to come out in full force. I wanted to scream when I pressed my hand against my chest and felt nothing.

There were no tears when I tried to cry, to sob.

Because what was in front of me tainting every shade of white was—me.

I wasn’t hungry anymore.

Or thirsty.

When I left the stall that night, there was a trainee waiting for me. She was leaning against the wall, her arms folded.

She saw the pooling red spreading from my stall. She saw it dripping from me—and yet she didn’t say anything.

When I left the bathroom, I went back to the studio to continue training. I wasn’t surprised when my body bent in the perfect way, and every dance move was perfect. When I stood in front of the mirror and frowned at my face, at the state I was in, I could only think of one thing.

I was perfect. Swiping away the red from my face with a towel, I wondered if “shedding” would have been the right word for what the capsule did. I used to have a baby face and a pointy nose. 

According to Binna, I was the least attractive in our group which put me at the back. But looking at my reflection I didn’t recognise the girl staring back. My face had been contorted into a beauty I didn’t think was possible. I was exactly who Binna wanted me to be all along.

I’d perfected my routine when she stuck her head in, ignoring the scarlet smears on the floor.

“Well done.” She clapped her hands and cranked up the music. “Now, I want you to do it with your eyes closed.”

I did.

I danced until dawn, and I didn’t even realise because I didn’t get tired. I kept going and going and going, my body twirling and twisting and swaying, and I didn’t collapse or lose my breath or hit the ground. When Binna stepped in front of me and told me to smile, to grin, I did. 

I remember at some point I went back to our apartment, only to step in pooling red when I opened the door. Sara was wrapped up in blood stained sheets on our bed, while the boy’s were on the floor. 

None of us spoke of it when they woke up. They just got ready for training and cleaned up whatever they could. I noticed Shelling had changed them too, only turning them more beautiful than they already were, skin so pale it was practically translucent.

When we performed in front of shadows who drank us in like pieces of meat, we got a standing ovation. We were perfect. 

We were perfect in our dancing, our singing, our choreography, and the chemistry between us. The higher ups and our manager were already labelling us. Sara was the beauty of the group, Jason was the baby-face, Fee was the face of for photography, and I was the “cute” one. 

We were given a name, and we prepared to debut. Training days were longer, but we didn’t sleep so it didn’t matter. I guess I was caught up in the high of being a potential idol, I didn't realise what had really happened to me, and what is STILL happening to me. 

Once you start to take away someone’s rights and choices you can pick away at them until they are nothing. Binna barked orders at us, and we followed them. 

She told us exactly what to wear and what not to wear, personally contacting our parents to ensure we were doing fine. 

I couldn’t walk outside the studio without a security guard on my tail. The tags came next. An injection in our neck to track our location and make sure we weren’t getting into trouble. I could partly understand at first. Because we don’t eat, we get our food and sustenance from someplace else.

Energy has to come from somewhere.

Binna told us it’s easy. All idols and trainee’s here do it. If we don’t, we’re offered therapy so we can cope with the loss of emotion and feeling. But I didn’t want to sit in a room with a stranger and tell her that I craved the ability to scream again.

Initially, the four of us hunted together.

But then Fee decided to go on his own, and then Sara announced she too wanted time to herself.

So, it was just me and Jason.

If you walk into Hongdae, or even downtown Seoul in the middle of the night,  there’s bound to be someone hanging around.

My first kill was a college girl. She was waiting at the bus stop.

Jason distracted her, and I went in for the kill. We shared her that night between the three of us. Human meat kind of tastes like chicken, but it’s not the meat that sustains us; it’s everything else that was part of her, what died with her. Her emotions and memories were my favourite part. Because through my very first mouthful I could have sworn I’d felt them myself.

I felt her anger at her mother for forcing her to break up with her boyfriend.

Her happiness when said boyfriend insisted that they should move away and have a child.

I know it sounds gross, but that was the only thing that kept me going. I could still feel—even if those emotions weren’t mine.

Which brings us to the present.

Binna announced yesterday that we are going to debut at the beginning of next year.

I might have felt happy or joy, or something, when she told us. But I didn’t feel anything.

I’ve made it. I’m going to be an idol and I can’t fucking feel anything.

So, earlier I cut out the tag in my neck. It won’t be long before they realise. I’ve come right up here to sit on the edge of the night to tell you my story. But I do have a wish. Can you please support the others when they debut? That’s all I ask. They chose the names they're going to debut with today. Due to privacy reasons, their actual names won't be released to the public. They’ve worked so hard, and I need them to succeed.

I can see the sky is inching towards dawn right now.

The moon is slipping away and another morning bleeds into reality.

Training.

Senseless killing just to feel.

Nah.

I’m going to escape 😊

I can’t help wondering…

Will hitting the ground even kill me? If I’ve thrown up every bodily organ and every piece of me, what else is there to fucking die?

Sorry, I didn’t mean to end this on a salty note.

I think I’m going to hang here for a while. I can sense Binna coming, but she won’t catch me.

She won’t make another choice for me again.

Thank you for reading. I’m sorry if I babbled. I just got my phone back and I’ve forgotten how to use it.

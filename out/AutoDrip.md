Drip...drip...drip.....


Gurgle...gurgle....


Rumble...tear them open...rumble


Drip...drip...drip....


That guttural, gravely yet somehow joyful voice. Snuck in between the regular brewing sounds. Usually suggestions, sometimes it's moans or screams. All could be easily dismissed as normal noises of operation, unless you really listen.


My new coffee maker is beginning to worry me. Since I bought it, it has been making sounds that I've never heard come from a coffee maker. Grunts or a word cut off halfway through. Today, it's pretty close to a full sentence and it's starting to make sense. It also makes the best coffee I've ever had.


Using my regular coffee and tap water it brews delicious coffee that wakes you up but also seems to give you something a little extra. It raises your spirits, makes you excited to take on the day. The voice is creepy but the coffee is damn good.


I stare at the coffee maker from my kitchen table, waiting for the pot to fill. My vision slowly zooms in until all I can see is the coffee maker. 


Drip....drip....


Gurgle...bathe in their blood...gurgle


Rumble...drip............drip...................drip


The coffee is ready and I'm ready for the day. This coffee stays perfect drinking temperature from the second you pour it, until your last sip. Every cup I drink helps me realize that the voice is just a fun quirk of the best coffee maker in the world. 


I am in a cold sweat. Suddenly terrified, I feel the urge to destroy the coffee maker. It seems like the only thing in my life that matters. I absent mindedly pour myself a cup of coffee and sit down at the table. I feel better after the first mouthful.


I am standing with my face less than an inch away from the operation light. The red glow is burning my eyes. I don't remember getting up and there's no coffee in the pot. I remember taking one drink but I must have drunk the whole pot without realizing it. I pull out the coffee and filter to make some more.


Rumble...Kill your daughter...gurgle....


The voice startles me because haven't even put in the water in yet. I put the coffee in the filter, pour in the water and start the brewing process. There is faint terrified screaming noise in my head but my focus is directed towards the utensil drawer.


I grab a fillet knife, a knife used to clean fish. I remove its cover and see my eyes in the reflection on the blade, they're glowing red. I walk slowly down the hallway, past the bathroom door, past my room and onto the door at the end of the hall.


I place my hand on the door knob and then involuntarily pull it away. I hear a voice deep inside my head, screaming at me to stop. I am not in control of my own body, I try to scream and run away from the door but I can't. I put my hand back on the knob.


I open the door, I wade through toys and pillows to reach my daughter, asleep in her bed. I look at her face and the voice in my head is much louder now. It's my voice, my inner monologue, begging and pleading with me to stop. It was Sobbing hopelessly. The feeling of terror is back and I try to run or at least drop the knife, no luck.


My body ignores my voice again and place the tip of the knife to my daughter's neck. I proceed to drive the knife into her neck but am only able to penetrate to a superficial depth. Her eyes snap open. She is confused and crying. My voice is now in full control again. I throw the knife under the bed and hug my daughter tight. I cry with her, still horrified at the idea of losing control again. I tell her she was having a bad dream and that she was scratching at her neck. I calm her down. I'm about to tuck her back in when I notice the time.


It's time to get up. I could really go for some coffee; it always makes me feel better about things like this. It seems no matter the consequences, I can't stop drinking this coffee.

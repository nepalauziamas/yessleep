I was wet and cold so I started a fire in the fireplace. I was lucky that there was some firewood inside the mill and next to them was a box of matches.

As I was standing close to the fireplace in an attempt to get myself warm. I looked ever so often at the door behind me that was locked to keep me safe from the dangers of the woods.

A lot of things were going thru my head at the moment. How am I going to survive the night or is this my last night alive? No, I am too young to die so early I have a whole life ahead of me. How could my Uncle leave me to die?

My thoughts were interrupted by a child's laughter. It was the boy from the bridge the one that wants me dead now.

My gaze fell on the door. The door started to shake and something was pounding on it. I think it lasted a couple of seconds but for me, it lasted like hours but it finally stopped.

I sighed in relief and was thankful that the door had managed to keep me safe for now.

I glanced around the mill it didn't have much, a table with two chairs, a stone mill, and a bed. As I looked at the bed I saw that something was under the pillow. I lifted the pillow and under it was a book.

It had no title on its cover and as I opened it to look at it it had a list of instructions.

When I read the instructions I looked at the fire. I needed to get some extra firewood. But I needed a lantern. I searched around the mill but I couldn't find a lantern.

I didn't have much time so I opened the door and looked outside. There I saw a lantern tied to a branch of a tree.

I knew it was stupid and dangerous but I just quickly ran to the tree and took the lantern. As I ran back I felt like something was chasing me but luckily I got inside and locked the door behind me.


I lit the lantern and took a big breath and went outside. I could hear the river, which made me think about the boy I just hope that the lantern can protect me from him as well.

I went to the back of the mill and there I found the ax mentioned in the instructions. It was an all red ax. I tried to chope the firewood by just using one of my hands to wield the ax. But I wasn't strong enough to do it.

 So I had to put the lantern down and chope the firewood using both of my hands. As I chopped the firewood, I saw what looked like a hand reaching for the lantern I instinctively swung my ax at the hand, chopping it off.

 The creature let out an inhuman scream. Then I saw what looked like hundred eyes looking at me. I hurriedly carried the firewood and went back inside the mill.


So I think I managed to get enough firewood to last me till morning. I just need to stay inside and I will survive.

I looked at my phone it had a 50% battery. But no signal. That means I can't call for help if I needed it.

Not knowing what to do I lay on the bed. It wasn't that comfortable but I was tired so I fell asleep.

I woke up hearing a knocking outside, I looked at the fireplace, and the fire was almost extinguished so I quickly added firewood, to the already low flame of fire.

Outside I heard my uncle and my parents calling me to open the door and come outside so I can go home. It was almost too good to be true. 

Like in a trance I unlocked the door and went outside. And there they were my uncle and my parents. My dad was still wearing the Hawaiian shirt that he wore when they went on vacation.

They were standing far away from the mill, how did they knock on the door? I heard what seemed to be music it's weird why would they play music outside if they knew it was dangerous and I can attract the Guardian?

Then I stopped and realized they were the fairies. The atmosphere changed it was ridiculously cold. They looked at me but they weren't smiling anymore they just stood there. 

I ran to the mill and they started chasing me. In desperation I threw the lantern at them they started to burn. As they burned they screamed and rolled on the ground giving me time to escape. 

I locked the door hoping I managed to kill them. But I lost the lantern so no more going outside I will have to wait till morning. I looked at my phone I don't have to wait for long only a few hours. 

Then I saw what looked like a person sitting at the table. But something was wrong he didn't look natural more like a dark being trying to look human. 

It was black, and it didn't have a face not even eyes. But it was looking in my direction looking at me. I don't know when it entered the mill but it was waiting for me. How long was I outside? 

It stood up and stayed still. I didn't know what to do maybe there is something in the book that can help get rid of it.

As I reached for the book so did it. We were both holding the book we started to fight for the book. It was way stronger than me so it got the book but I managed to rip a piece of paper from the book. It read burning it in fire will banish it.

But how would I do that? The only way was for me to burn myself.

Oh heck, this is going to hurt. I approached the fireplace and so did it. I put more firewood inside and so did it. When it all started to burn in a big flame.

 I put my hand inside. I almost fainted from the pain. But when the creature put its hand on the fire it just disappeared. I got a pretty bad burn on my hand and it's probably going to damage my skin.

I looked outside and it was mourning. I can finally leave.

I packed my thing and disassembled my gun. And left the mill. I had a long walk ahead of me. I was looking on my phone to see if I had any signal. When I bumped into something. I looked up and saw the Guardian.

I looked at him in fear and expected that I will die. He just put a finger on my forehead and I fell unconscious. I woke up in front of my Uncles house. I don't remember if got here myself or the Guardian carried me here.

The dogs were barking like crazy. I got closer to the house but It was quiet. The door was left wide open. I had a bad feeling in my stomach as if something bad happened. I entered the house and I saw...

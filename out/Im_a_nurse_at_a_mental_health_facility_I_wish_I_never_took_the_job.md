Hello everyone, my name is Julia. I'm a nurse at a mental health facility. I will not disclose the name of the facility...for everyones safety. I'm one of the nurses that works only night shifts, I like them, they are relaxing and usually quiet. I have 2 co-workers which I will refer to as Tasha and Mary. Tasha is a 19 year old girlÂ  that mostly keeps to herself and isn't very social, Mary on the other hand is the complete opossite, she's 52 years old and loves to talk about...pretty much anything. 

Okay now that you know a bit about me and my co-workers let me tell you a story that haunts me to this day.
When I got to my work place, everything went as usual, I got checked in, said goodbye to the already exhausted day shift nurses and started my day.
We don't have many things to worry about in the night shift, we need to give our patients their medication at 10pm, clean up a bit and answer the occasional call from patients who want to go to the bathroom.
That night, I finished giving the medication to the patients and was ready to relax and listen to some music on my phone.


I got back, sat down on a chair, plugged in my earphones and just as I was about to put them in and relax, Tasha interrupted me: 

"H..hey, could you come check this out for a moment?" She said in a whisper 

Hmm a bit unlike her to ask anything or even talk to me for that matter, but hey, I'm not going to refuse an offer to make a new friend and talk to someone else other than Mary, so I obliged. 

As we were walking down the corridor I noticed we were taking a route that could only lead to one room...The morgue. 

"Umm is there something wrong in the morgue?" I asked.
Tasha kept quiet and just nodded her head. Nurses had access to the morgue but we never had to go down there, even if a patient died it would have to wait for a team to come in day time. 

When we got to the heavy steel door of the morgue Tasha looked at me and gestured with her hand to follow her.
When we got in, the cold temperature gave me the chills, but other than that I didn't notice anything wrong with it. 

"Soo what is it?" I said, half expecting her not to even answer me. 

"Look, down there, to the right." Tasha said. 

I looked at it and I felt dread creep up on me, one of the body storages were open. 

"D..did you open it?" I asked 
"No." She replied coldly.
As I got closer I realised a detail that I should've long before, the name tags were empty, not only on the open storage unit, every..single..one was empty. I turned around to ask Tasha if she had also noticed it, but when I looked back...she was gone. 

At this point I was scared shitless, I had to get Mary and get the hell out of this place, we will explain the situation tommorow.
I rushed up the steps and trough the corridor, almost tripping couple of times.
"Mary!!, Mary!!!!" I screamed at the top of my lungs with terror clearly noticable in my voice. 

As I neared Mary's office I yelled:
"There is something wrong with this place, we need to get out now!" 

But when I got in...she wasn't there, I only saw splatters of blood on the floor and the walls. As I was trying to process the information and thinking about what to do next, I heard Tasha scream from the direction of the morgue. 

"I'm not leaving her behind." I thought as I rushed to the corridor, back to the morgue again. I came to the door and stopped, there was blood on the door and words "Help" were written on it.
I slowly opened the door, only to find it in the same condition I left it in moments ago. 
In a soft whisper I called Tasha's name as I moved forward and all of a sudden, everything went black. 

I woke up, strapped on an autopsy table and as I gained consiousnes I realised that I was still in the morgue. 

I started to struggle when I heard a deep voice saying "You're awake." I tried to turn my head to see who it was but my restraints kept me from looking back. 

"Do you remember me?" A big masculine man stood before me...with a nametag?
"N..no no it can't be." I thought to myself, "he's been dead for over 2 years now.." 

"Oh, so you do remember!" The man said.
And yes...I did remember "George Phillman, 45 years old, died by natural causes." Only... it wasn't right, we both knew it. 

"So, why did you do it?" Said the man.
"Do what?" I acted stupid, not wanting to remember.
"Why did you kill me? Why did you add rat poison to my food?" Said the man as I started to sob uncontrollably. 

"You were dying, I was doing you a favor!" I said even though I knew it wouldn't justify what I did.
"The only person you did any favors for was your selfish self!" Man spat at me.


"And me? Do you remember me?" Said a familiar elderly voice, and as he got into view, I could immediately recognize him.
"Samuel Shillington, 74 years old, cause of death: natural causes." I said.
"We both know that is not true, you did it on purpose, you killed me." He said. 

"It was a mistake... I accidentaly swapped your medication with another patient!" I said, raising my tone a bit higher in defense.
"So why did you tell me to enjoy my last few moments minutes before the heart attack? How could've you known?" 

I couldn't know... "I did it on purpose" I said softly.


And then a voice that I put in the back of my broken mind boomed out from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. 

"Oh god no, Tasha?" And just as I said that, everything hit me at once, I couldn't believe I hadn't figured it out sooner, it was right there... 

"Yes, its me, Julia, I see you still remember me very clearly." A voice of a small girl said, in a voice so calm that it made me shiver even more. 

"I'm sorry... I'm so sorry!" I started crying.




"You and Mary... You killed me just because of my mother, even though I have nothing to do with what she did, I did nothing wrong, yet I paid for it" 

It is true, her mother was a part of a terrorist group that killed more then a dozen people in a coffee shop, among those people were my parents and my little brother, Mary lost her only son that day. 

"Tasha, how did you..." I trailed off as she finished my sentence. 

"How did I join the company and change my appearance? How did I age 10 years in only 5 months? Hatred is the answer, I swore to myself I would kill you and Mary if it was the last thing I do!" 
She pulled out a knife and plunged it deep into my chest as I looked up at her 9 year old form, choking on my own blood as it filled my lungs. 

"Feel the pain I felt, experience the same moments of hell that you made me experience!" She yelled. 

As she was starting to make a Y incision, I lost my consiousnes. 

I woke up in a white room with a form on the desk next to me that read:
"Julia Star, age 36, ex-nurse, charged with a triple homicide, sentence: life, time served: 10 years."

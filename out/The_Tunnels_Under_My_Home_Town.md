So for the past few years, I’ve been having a series of dreams in a sort of “bizzaro” version of my home town. I live in a small town, in the “sunny” south east of Ireland. I never came up with a proper name for the dream version of it so I‘ll just call it Nightworld. It’s always night time, and it’s completely empty; I’m literally the only one there. 

&#x200B;

The atmosphere is strange – the best way I can describe it is you go for a walk on Christmas Eve in the late hours of the night. It’s that odd cocktail of cosiness and loneliness, all those warm lights with a muted undercurrent of mirth, but with only your own company to enjoy it all with. It’s cold, but not unpleasantly so. I never felt creeped out despite all the dark windows around me – at least, I didn’t feel creeped out for the first few times I had these dreams.

&#x200B;

The layout of the town is fairly accurate to the real life version, but the further I move away from the town centre, the weirder things get.

&#x200B;

For example, we have this canal that goes down by the river, beside our town’s castle. It goes quite a bit past the castle and alongside the adjacent park. In Nightworld however, it loops into the where the park would be, cutting through where the walls and trees stand in real life and leads into a weird “old town” district, filled with moulding red brick buildings and narrow, grimy alleyways. No such place exists in the waking world - that location is just an open field and a monument in the castle’s park.

&#x200B;

At first I thought I was seeing some weird alternate universe version of my home town, but as I took advantage of the lack of people (and thus lack of law enforcement), I began to explore sections of the town that would normally be off-limits. You know the kinds of places – little alleyways used by shops for shipments, roofs of tall buildings not accessible to the public, mostly places to sate my innocent curiosity. Those days were quite exciting; I felt like a kid exploring parts of a video game map that I didn’t even know were there to explore.

&#x200B;

So imagine my excitement when my friend used his drone to help me see if the places in real life matched up with their dream counterparts. To see them match up with with eerie accuracy sent a dizzying rush of excitement and possibility straight to my head. I decided to see how far I could take this. I recalled an urban legend that circulated a few years back, something about a tunnel network being hidden beneath the castle as an escape route for the owners in case of a siege during the middle ages.

&#x200B;

It’s common knowledge that there are a small series of tunnels gated off on the castle grounds, once use by servants to flit about their work unseen by visitors who would deem their visibility distasteful. But the legend pertained to tunnels that went much deeper than that, and much further out. Some of the more fantastic variations of the myth even had them connect into a cave network that extended well beyond the city limits, and even intermingled with catacombs beneath the streets, filled with the casualties of the black plague from the 1300s.

&#x200B;

I can now confirm that it is all true.

&#x200B;

I visited the castle and went down to the lowest levels. After a while hunting around, I found a gate leading down an old stone tunnel that was definitely not a part of the more office-like rooms I had been searching around in. I managed to find the key to unlock it; it was a hefty rusted bar of a thing, standing out from the other keys like a sore thumb. I can never seem to enter the dream with any objects on my person, but then again I haven’t actually tried, so I had to find a flashlight to light my way.

&#x200B;

I must have been down there for hours. I would probably never do that in real life for fear of getting lost or caught in some flood or cave in, but even though it felt super realistic, the fact I was in a dream took the true fear out of it. After a while I even began to enjoy myself. It’s not often you can brag about solving an urban legend by yourself, and in your dreams of all places at that.

&#x200B;

The tunnels connecting to the cave network: true.The shaped stone tunnels gave way at parts to more natural caverns. I could actually see small streams from the river above leaking through small pockets of eroded rock.

&#x200B;

The catacombs: also true. Thousands of bodies compacted and stored away, lining the walls and passages in a web of tunnels extending all around where the town centre was, as far as I could tell.

&#x200B;

All of this was no doubt well-known to the local authorities, but I’d imagine they kept it all under wraps to prevent vandalism or accidental deaths or disappearances. The forbidden sections of the Paris catacombs came to mind, where the difference between a spooky subterranean stroll and a tourist dying lost and alone in the dark were a series of well-staffed old rusty gates. My town’s council take their heritage very seriously, so it would be just like them to be better safe than sorry. They also love the money tourism brings, so the idea of some safe sections being opened as a sort of Irish equivalent of the Paris catacombs might have been on the cards further down the line. That is, if I had never went where I did next.

&#x200B;

I was prepared for lots of rock, for more of the same tunnels and old remains.

&#x200B;

The one thing I wasn’t prepared for were the doors.

&#x200B;

They stood within a large open cave connected to the catacombs, a vast portal of solid rock. Surrounding them were a series of stations, desks littered in papers and files scattered around. A series of floodlights illuminated the doors, and several very high-end cameras mounted on sturdy tripods were trained on the doors in an eternal vigil. The doors didn’t appear to have any locking mechanism, just two huge slabs of rock, twenty feet high each and half as wide. But it was what lay across them that caught my eye. 

&#x200B;

A wooden staff, lying flat across the crack between the doors. It was as if it was a barricade holding them closed, even though it seemed like a tiny twig compared to them. It looked to be made of wood, coated in gold. It’s head was like a branch, curved around into a graceful circle containing what looked like a Celtic cross.

&#x200B;

I lifted it from it’s resting place, trying to see if I could make out any inscriptions or details that could tell me a bit more about it. I only had the chance to make out some Ogham inscription along the top, which I couldn’t translate.

&#x200B;

Before I could read further, the massive doors swung open as if kicked by the foot of a giant. A gust of the foulest smelling air I have ever smelled blasted me in the face, and my ears were pounded by a deafening hiss. Just as suddenly as the doors opened I snapped awake, ears ringing and heart pounding in the silent dark.

&#x200B;

Ever since that night, I’ve been afraid to go to sleep again. My days are spent struggling through my usual routines, and my nights are spent struggling to stay awake. When I do drift off to sleep, I inevitably go back to Nightworld. It used to be that I would have to consciously try to go there; it was always my choice. Now I end up there no matter how much I wish to dream of something else. 

&#x200B;

And the thing is, I am no longer alone.

&#x200B;

I was so used to the only sound being my own breath and footsteps. Now, I can hear sounds in the distance. Muffled at first, so subtle or far away that I thought I imagined them. Then I heard them getting closer. They get closer each time I sleep. Just last night I saw foggy breath waft from around an alleyway corner, and heard a hissing sound as something moved away. There were no footsteps; it sounded like it was sliding along the ground. It’s like it’s taunting me, whatever it is. And I am afraid it has something to do with the door and the staff. I’ve had some close calls with the thing, relying on hiding within the nooks and crannies that I’ve explored so far.

&#x200B;

I’ve tried losing it in the wilderness outside of town, but the further away from the town I move, the denser the foliage becomes - far more than real life. On top of that, my way is blocked by nonsensical structures, things like buildings and sign posts in places they shouldn’t be, tied up in a wall of thorns and weeds.

&#x200B;

In the days following my foray into the tunnels, there has been a spate of killings in the town. Fatal stabbings, often involving drugs and the debts that come with them. Thing is, among the pattern of deaths, some stick out. Our local newspaper, ever desperate for ad revenue, have been less than subtle about the details surrounding the deaths. For one, several of them have had nothing to do with drugs, or any form of criminal activity for that matter. The ones that were found were found dead at various locations along the river, with large circular stab wounds along their bodies. Local whispers say they exhibit signs of having been poisoned, but it’s up in the air as to which poison. 

&#x200B;

Most were never found at all.

&#x200B;

The Gardaí are baffled, as these are well known, salt of the earth type locals who’d never be involved in any sort of crime in a million years, and looked to be just enjoying evening strolls at the time they were killed. 

&#x200B;

There are theories abound on whether it was crazy addicts, poisoned weapons, or that maybe the victims weren’t as innocent as everyone thought them to be, and had their fair share of debts - and enemies to owe them to.

&#x200B;

Only a few days later, a local busybody posted a photo to local groups, complaining of a horrid case of dumping in the old mill ruins down by the river. The photo showed a multitude of plastic bags dumped over the thorns and bracken that grew within the ruins, crowning large piles of what appeared to be faecal matter.

&#x200B;

At first I thought it to be some prank or case of genuine dumping, but the plastic bags had a weird colour to them. As I zoomed in on the picture, I realised why they seemed so familiar. A friend of mine used to have a pet snake. When it shed it’s skin, it would leave behind a bone-coloured husk of it’s former skin. Those plastic bags looked exactly like that. Only this skin would have to belong to something truly massive for their to be so much of it.

&#x200B;

I’ve visited the castle in my waking hours, and it’s no surprise that they’ve ramped up security after my little night time visit. I’ve watched them, seeing who comes to and from the castle. A team of archaeologists is busy digging at a small site in front of the castle. Their Facebook page claims it’s for unearthing recently found remains, but I know better. If anyone stuck around to watch them like I have, they’d see the archaeologists taking shifts inside the castle, while the ones who are supposedly digging out front seem to arse around on their phones more than anything else. The desks and equipment I saw in Nightworld must be theirs.

&#x200B;

As well as the archaeologists, I’ve seen these official-looking men come and go from the castle all day. They honestly look like stereotypical secret agents or something, all sunglasses and suits. I’ve seen them speak with castle staff, the archaeologists, and even some local politicians, and all seemed equally nervous when talking to them. I’ve checked local news, but nothing has come up about them. Absolutely nothing. All that comes up is the archaeologist's page updates and other mundane news about the castle.

&#x200B;

I plan to approach one of them tomorrow. I don’t know what sort of rabbit hole I’m about to go down here, but I need answers.

&#x200B;

Whether I’m asleep or awake, something is out there, and it’s going to keep feeding. At least while I’m awake, it’s spoiled for choice, and there is safety in numbers.

&#x200B;

When I’m asleep, it’s just me and it.

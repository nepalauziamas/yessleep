Hello. My name is Kara Lynx, Please, if you are reading this, send help.

It's currently 11:15 PM, I am hiding in the attic of a modern, one story large home at Wanderers' Street in the United States. This morning I've been just preparing for work until I saw some sort of figure walking up onto my porch and towards the glass door. 

At first I thought it was a burglar, It was the right side and shape as a fairly large man, I live alone so I resorted to grabbing my handgun I hide in my kitchen counter for emergencies. I went back to the glass door and while on the way yelled to warn the man to leave and that I have a weapon.

It did not work. I arrived at the door and pointed the gun at the man, Yelling again for them to back off. The man began pounding on the door with his bare fists, it was loud and in the heat of the moment I aimed at his leg and shot, hoping to get him to back the hell off.

Upon being shot, the man made some sort of roar-yell and looked up at me, His face was.... Hairy. There was no mouth, nor nose. It was horrifying, I've seen tens of homeless people or drunks with plenty of hair but it was NOTHING like that. 

It pounded the door even harder, I screamed and shot it, over and over. The bullets went right through this... Thing. No blood spilled on the ground and the holes in its body quickly disappeared just right after being made. It was only getting more angered. It began violently slamming its head against the door, eventually causing the glass to shatter. 

I swore under my breath and decided to run.  I made my way to the other side of the house to the main door, grabbing the handle and desperately trying to open the door. Fuck, I left the key in the kitchen. That thing proceeded to chase me and almost cornered me, the only place I could go was up the stairs that are right next to the main door.

I climbed up the stairs, before it could follow me i grabbed my ladder from the side of the upstairs hallway and placed it next to the trapdoor that leads to the attic, Thank God I managed to open it. I crawled up the ladder as fast as I could, the thing was now up the stairs. I went into the attic and kicked the ladder down.

The disgusting, ugly creature caught up to me and attempted to jump up and reach the trapdoor, I slammed it shut and put a bunch of old junk and boxes on top of it. I waited for tens of minutes, groans and growls and yells came from below me. 

But eventually, it walked away. I carefully shoved the items off the trapdoor and opened it then looked down. Before I could even catch a good glimpse of the hallway I hear rapid footsteps and angry roars coming towards me. I yelped and closed the trapdoor again before I could see it. The snarls and groans continued for another hour or so, all I knew is that this thing doesn't give up easily.

And now, we're here. I've sat here for hours, it's not giving up. I'm sitting silently in the attic, writing this on my phone. Fuck, I don't have signal for a call. Great... My phone is at 23% battery already. I need to hurry up with this. Please, If you are reading this, call the police, the neighbor, even come here yourself, WHOEVER! Get me out of here! I will attempt communication if I do not get rescued, but for now I need to save my battery.

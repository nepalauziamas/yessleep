Okay, well I guess this is my story. Or.. their story. If you're reading this, they are dead. I am their sister, I found this in their "drafts". Great. I'll start telling the story now.

June 26, 2007, 15:42.

I'd been on this road for over an hour. The AC wasn't operating, and I was hot and sweaty. My back was sticking to the hot leather, and this road hadn't yet ended, which was odd as my GPS had been telling me that I only had 27 minutes left on this road and would arrive to my destination in a few hours. There had never been a problem like this on the road getting to my Great Grandfather's cabin. I was only taking a road trip for a little over a week for the 4th, anyways. I had my trip all planned out. I left today at 8:30 exactly, packed everything, I left my dog at my parents' house and was only going to be gone for 10 days.

Then it hit me. 'I forgot my Laptop!' God, that's pathetic. I was planning to work everyday except for Wednesday, when I was going out and going to this fourth of July carnival. But anyway, my boss is going to *kill me.* Well, at least if this heat doesn't. 'God, it's hot in here. I'll turn on the radio to pass the time,' I twist the knob on the radio. 'Oh, right. Off the grid. Great. I'm set for life here!" I think to myself. 'All I need right now is to be overheating in a car, in the middle of nowhere, off the grid. And this road *still* won't fucking *end!'* Right then, the GPS makes a little "beep!" noise. I look over to it. 'That's odd...' The GPS shows some question mark. 'What? I swear it just read something! I'm going crazy, I'm going to take a nap in the back.' I climb to the back, lock the doors and leave each window open a crack.

*Crack!*

I wake up. Oh. I just nudged a protein bar wrapper. I'll throw it out. As I go to throw it out, though, I notice a hitchhiker on the side of the road. They look.. odd. Eh, it's probably fine. I just have to ignore them. So I climb to the front, and that's when I *really* Notice this hitchhikers' features. Pale skin, but looks... non-human. It's hard to describe. I turn on the engine, but it won't start. 'Shit.' I think. The last gas station was something like 30 miles back! I then realized it. I *reall*y had to use the restroom! Suddenly, I heard a loud shriek followed by a weird 'crack!' I look up and see the.. figure. Staring directly at me, but at the same time, it's eyes darting all around, as if it was hypnotized.

I was weirded out. *Visibly* weirded out. I think it could tell. I could see it better now. It's eyes were like tiny little beads. It had almost no hair, no eyebrows and no eyelashes. It was incredibly skinny, to the point it couldn't *possibly* be human. it was at least 6 feet tall, The smile was very unsettling, drooling a jet-black liquid. I couldn't look long, but I noticed it's long, bony fingers. it's fingernails were ragged and long, and a weird yellow color. It smiled again, much larger this time, and said "*Hey, could you possibly lend me a ride to the next town over?"* I didn't have time to respond, for before I could, it reached it's hand to my mouth through the gap in the window, and put it's finger over my mouth, silencing me. It then broke the window, covering me in glass. it climbed in, pushed me to the passenger seat, and tried to turn on the car.

An odd, confused emotion showed on it's face, followed by anger. It pushed me out of the car, on the hot pavement. It suddenly started shifting around. "*Thank you. really."* It turned on the car, I don't even know how... It drove off top speed, and I saw it starting to change. And now, I was. I grew taller, paler. "You're.. welcome?" My voice sounded different. I could no longer see anything clearly. My fingers grew longer. I suddenly became driven by rage. hatred and anger were all I could feel. I could only wait for the next poor driver to end up on this road.

Oh well. I had all the time in the world.

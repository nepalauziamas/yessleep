My name is Michael Simmons, I am sharing this post after what I saw this morning . Please, as unbelievable as what I’m about to describe is. Believe me, I think I’m in danger.

Recently I have been waking up with grazed scratches across my back and chest. I had put this down to a restless sleep or something I had done during the previous day. I have lived alone ever since my wife left me, nobody else in the house. I sometimes hear the odd shuffle or knock at night but always put this down to the fact my walls are thin and have neighbours either side.

Two days ago I woke up to blood on my pillow and four scratches from just below my left eye down to my jawline. I was now getting quite concerned, wondering what I did to myself while I slept. This is when I had a thought, I will record myself at night and show it to a doctor to see what was causing my aggressive sleeping. 

The evening had set in and I set up my old GoPro camera to record my nights sleep, the next morning I woke to no scratches, as I looked up to where I had placed the camera on top of my wardrobe, it was gone. I looked all over my bedroom, even pulling my wardrobe out to see if it fell behind, nothing. 

Last night I managed to set up an online live feed with a wireless webcam to my computer so I could record the full night. I woke this morning eager to look at the footage, again I had no marks on my body. I forwards through a few hours with nothing but me sleeping. At 03:23 the door handle slowly began to turn, the door crept open and I saw someone crawl inside my room, it looked like a girl. She was maybe 4ft tall, pale bone tight skin around her arms and legs. Her clothes ripped exposing deep wounds that covered the entirety of her body. 

I shuddered, every hair was now standing on end, as I witnessed my nightly visitor approach me. She was crawling on all fours, somehow going across the ceiling and down the wall above my head. She contorted her head up towards the camera suddenly, her matted hair partly covering her piecing eyes. In an instant she darted across the wall and disappeared. A few seconds later her lifeless face appeared from the side of the camera, strands of hair flowing down her bloodied face, she whispered the hallowing words from her blue blistered lips “Night, Night”

The feed stopped. 

I have now watched the video in pure horror 5 times already, I don’t know what to do, how long has she been here?! All I want to do is move. I will upload the video once it has downloaded. I can hear a constant shuffling sound around the house as I wri

I moved schools this year after going to the same middle school for so long. I didn’t mind going to New port middle school even though the bathrooms stunk like shit. Me and my parents and my sister moved to utah because my grandmother died so now the family wants to be closer together. Something about sticking together or some bullshit. I know that all my mom’s sisters gossip about each other behind their backs. 

So here I am, going to West point high with no friends and no one to hang out with after school. That all ended when I met Jordan. She walked up to me during lunch and asked me, “you’re not from Utah are you?” I said no and said I was from Lousiana. She told me she had visited New Orleans one time which doesn’t have anything to do with where I was in Lousiana but I appreciated the thought. So there we were, me and my new friend Jordan. She’s hyper, enthusiastic, and she’s down to do whatever. I honestly couldn’t ask for a better start to Utah. Maybe my parent’s decision won’t be so terrible after all.

2 years have passed and I’m a junior now. I made a couple friends since I moved but none of them compare to Jordan, she’s so perfect. I plan on asking her to be my girlfriend tonight when we go out to eat after school. I prepared roses, and a necklace for her. I know I know it seems like overkill, but I really want her to understand that she should be mine. 

The time has come and I am ready to ask her out. I showered, put on deodorant, and even put on my dad’s fancy cologne. Here we are at Wayne’s and my heart’s beating so fast. I pull the roses and the necklace out and ask her, “Jordan, will you do me the honor of being my girlfriend?” “How the fuck did I manage to sound like such a nerd saying that”,I  thought. “Now she’s going to say no”. She just stared at me with her now red eyes, (must be the lighting) and she starts laughing. She laughed harder and harder until my Dignity was gone.

 She laughed so hard her jaw unhinged and locked in an abnormally large size. “Oh my god are you ok Jordan?” I said. She just kept staring at me making random mumbled noises due to her jaw being locked open. She suddenly decided to sprint into the bathroom with speed I had never seen her use before and I chased her into it. She had locked herself in a stall at the end of the bathroom and I could here her crying. “Jordan, I’m sorry if I embarrassed you by asking you out here, so please forgive me for my mistake.” She stuck her head over the stall and gave me a heart attack. The iris and the pupils of her eyes were vanta black and the bottom of her eyelids sagged to the tip of her nose. That wasn’t the only weird thing, She had her entire neck and head over the stall and I could see her legs and knees sitting normally on the toilet seat.  She said to me, “If only you stayed in your place, boy,  then you wouldn’t have to see this side of me. Well now that you know, I guess I have to relieve you of your trauma.”

Her head slithered down under the stall door as she tried to open the stall. I could see blood dripping from her fingertips onto the floor as she jammed them over and over again straight foward on the stall door. I told her to cut this shit out and to go back to Jordan. It ignored me and finally pushed me off the door and knocked me to the ground. Her hand which once was a bloody jumble of bones and flesh turned into a sharp piece of some kind of metal. 

She told me to stay still and it won’t hurt when a woman in her late twenties opened the door and shot Jordan seven time in the chest and four times in the head. Jordan flopped over as a now brutalized corpse full of bullet holes and covered in toilet water. I looked up to the mystery woman who introduced herself as an undercover cop named Heather. I thanked her for saving me and she kindly accepted.

 She took me to my home where my parents greeted Heather and thanked her for keeping me safe. Heather called me over and asked to speak to me one on one. She gave me her number and told me that if anything weird happens in the future that I should call that number. I said thanks and that she should kick ass like that more often. She laughed at the joke as she looked at me with her red, beady eyes and a disfigured unhinged jaw and said words that sounded like “have a nice night”.

I stood in front of the clock, knife in hand.

I had wanted to dismiss John Lewis’s diary as some kind of hallucination, but there was just too much I couldn’t explain. So much about my encounter with Emily had left me baffled–especially the way she had disappeared into the clock.

John Lewis had claimed that the stranger he encountered had used the knife as a sort of key, inserting it into the center of the clock’s face. I touched my fingers softly to the cold glass, searching again for hidden ridges, but I came up empty.

On the other side, there might be nothing. Or there could be Emily. Or the Traveler, waiting in the dark with his own glistening knife. Thinking of him, I started to sweat. Suddenly, it was like I was a boy again, watching him split the wallpaper in my bedroom with his razor sharp blade. Except in my imagination, it wasn’t wallpaper, but my skin, a wall of flash splitting clean down the center.

I held the knife inches away from the glass, preparing to stab forward. For some reason, I felt an instinctual hesitation, the way you might feel before stabbing a living thing.

I wondered, briefly, if my father had ever done this. Had he tried to travel through the clock, or had he only suspected that visitors came through it?

My father was a success by all accounts. He’d taken a struggling farm and survived a few hard years, buying his neighbors’ farms for pennies on the dollar during drought years.

Then the rains had come back, and everything seemed to break his way. Every crop he grew seemed to pay off better than expected, and after a few years a Big Ag company had offered to fold him into their business for an ungodly amount of stock. By the time he died, we were one of the richest families in the county.

My father always credited his success to tenacity. He’d been the last man standing. The sole survivor. Of course, around town there were whispers. Too much luck for one man, people would say. Deal with the devil, whispered the old women in church. My father paid them no heed. He was the hero of his own story. Which is why I ended up being such a disappointment to him.

“The Little Master,” he always called me, bitterly.

He’d been right, of course. Even as I got older, I made a habit of giving up. I was a B student in high school and a middling athlete. In college, I changed majors half a dozen times before finally graduating with a trendy “self-designed” liberal arts degree. My father had declined to attend my graduation.

He died shortly after that in an unexpected accident, falling down the house’s central stairs, his neck twisting around in an impossible angle. Any momentum I might have had in life seemed to leave me then. Maya had stuck with me for about a year after father’s death, seeing me through the grief. But I’m not sure that’s even what I’d been feeling. I was simply stopped. What did any of it matter, if my father wasn’t there to see?

My father was a success, but he was no adventurer. If anything, I was surprised he hadn’t had the clock encased in a steel box. Maybe he had his reasons not to.

I was no bold hero either, but here I stood, knife in hand. Maybe I just had less to lose.

I thought of Emily. Then I stabbed the clock face. The glass gave way beneath the knife blade like jello, parting cleanly as it began to glow bright blue.

My body began to tingle. Then everything went black.

I found myself in a vaguely familiar room. Small windows lit the otherwise dark space. An ancient furnace, no longer used, sat dormant in the corner. The basement. My basement–or at least, one very much like mine.

I looked back at the clock. Everything appeared the same as before, except for one key difference. Here, the hands pointed to eight.

Before I could examine the clock further, I heard footsteps from above and heard the door to the main floor open. Light flooded down the stairs, and I quickly hid beneath the furnace. Above me, I watched as Emily started down the stairs.

“I told you we’re not done talking,” came a man’s loud voice from behind her.

“Just have your assistant take care of it,” Emily shouted back. “Like when she gave me my period talk.”

“Now, Emily. Or you’ll regret it. I promise you.”

She turned back upstairs and closed the door behind her, the room going dark again.

Slowly, I crept up the dark staircase, listening to the sounds or arguing in the distance. Emily and the man walked in the direction of the front door, practically screaming at each other now. Then they headed outside. A minute later, I heard a car engine turn on. Then, all was silent.

Quietly, I opened the door to the main house and peered inside. Here was the kitchen–my kitchen–and yet entirely different. A wall of cabinets had been removed to create a modern open floor plan flowing into the living room, and the oak cabinets had all been painted white, their antique brass knobs replaced with stainless steel. Out in the living room, a garish 80-inch TV was playing CNN at low volume for an audience of no one.

Lining the staircase, the ancient portraits were gone, replaced with family photos: one of Emily in elementary school, and another of her posing with Maya Green. And then the one that made my heart stop: Emily, Maya, and me. At least, a version of me. He was maybe thirty pounds heavier, most of it muscle, with the kind of smile only successful people wear.

A few more steps up, I found another photo of him, this one wearing a red tie in front of an American flag and a small engraving at the bottom of the frame reading, “Sen. Stephen Walker of Oregon.”

In a strange stupor, I walked through the kitchen, looking for something to drink. But the liquor cabinet was full of tea tins, and the only drins in the fridge were cold-pressed juices.

“You’re a long way from home,” came a voice from behind me.

I turned to see a man in a gray suit. He wore dark glasses and a black facemask, obscuring his features, but I knew immediately who he was. I felt suddenly paralyzed, like I’d been caught breaking into my dad’s liquor cabinet and was about to catch the beating of a lifetime.

“It’s funny, you know,” he said. “I never took you for one to get off the couch, much less to go traveling through clocks. But that’s the nice thing about this business, I suppose. The surprises.”

He gestured to the grand kitchen around us.

“So what do you think, Seven? Some people say one version of hell is when the person you became meets the person you could have been. So here he is, the Golden Boy, or at least, he thinks so. Senator Stephen Walker. Of course, he’s not done yet. Ambitious one, he is. Already got his eyes on the White House. Oh, I hope he makes it. I’ve always wanted to kill a president. Yes, I think we’ll give Senator Walker a little time to ripen, see what he becomes.”

He took a step toward me, removing a poker from the fireplace. He swung it in lazy circles as he stepped toward me, his features inscuratable behind his mask.

“But you, Seven, I could give you a hundred years, and you’d just spin around the drain like a little unflushable–”

He was interrupted by the sound of the front door opening. Fast as a cat, he sprang up the stairs toward the attic, leaving the fire poker clattering on the kitchen floor in front of me.

Still reeling, I ran to the walk-in pantry, closing the door behind me as quietly as I could.

Through slats in the door, I peered out into the room. In walked Emily, a woman behind her who I recognized as Maya Green’s mother, Layla.

“Just give him time,” Layla was saying. “The stresses that man deals with on a daily basis are well beyond–”

But I could tell Emily wasn’t listening. Her eyes fixed on the poker in the center of the kitchen floor. She examined it for a moment, then looked directly at me, as if peering right through the pantry door.

“I just need some time, Grandma,” she said. “Actually, there’s someone I need to talk to. Why don’t you go to your room? We’ll catch up soon.”

As soon as Layla was gone, Emily walked right over and whispered through the slats.

“I hope you know how stupid you were to come here. We’re dead now, both of us.”

“I’m sorry,” I said.

“It’s okay,” she said, smiling a little now. “It was probably going to happen anyway. It’s–it’s kind of sweet. You–well, other you, has never really taken any interest in me before, so it’s kind of a nice change.” She reached for the doorknob, and the darkness around me was split with a beam of light as the door opened. “You’d better come out of there. We should talk.”

It’s been a few weeks since I posted about my housemate’s and their… situation. Initially, I was waiting for the next full moon, but so much has happened since I posted, I need to get all of this out.

I know that I can say this for sure now. I am no longer in denial.

No, my housemates are no longer human—and neither am I.

[And all of this?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wp640i/every_full_moon_my_housemates_insist_i_stay_in_my/) 

It’s my fault.


…


This post will be split into two. I went over the word-limit. A lot has happened, and I don’t want to censor anything. My housemates are monster’s

Cannibals hypnotised by the moon.

After my first post, it took me a while for what I had seen to fully sink in—and when it did, when my brain registered my housemate’s for what they really were, fight or flight took over. I had so many questions I wanted answering, like my replicated corpse’s under Kaz’s bed, the number’s carved into our neck’s and our ability to respawn like a fucking Call of Duty game. But I wasn’t going to get those answers if I stayed. If I stayed, I was going to keep searching for evidence that the three of them were really replicating me in order to eat me—the reason why they locked me in my room every full moon.

I thought they were embarrassed of their moon-drunk selves, but no. They were playing Silent Hill with my emaciated body. 

The moon’s influence had moved past sending them into a trance-like state and acting moon-drunk. This was a whole other level of side effect. One they were trying and failing to hide with smiles and nonchalant faces. And I couldn’t fucking stand it. I was going to go crazy. Especially when the three of them were acting like the night before never happened. 

Like I’d never found them chewing on my cannibalised body. Like I’d never seen them claw their throats open and drop dead right in front of me, only to come back to life and put on an award-winning act for the police I’d called to the house. I thought they were dead. 

I mean, I watched them. I watched them claw open their own throat’s under the moon’s hypnotising light. 

I needed answers.

Why we were replicating—and the numbers carved into mine and Rowan’s neck’s supposedly marking our copies.

Were Immie and Kaz the same?

I wasn’t going to find them staying in that house—not in my state of mind, anyway. Paranoia had taken over like a virus, like a parasite leeching onto my brain. Conversation with them turned into a game of cat and mouse in my mind. Kaz cornered me in the kitchen to lecture me about leaving the refrigerator door open, and I felt… trapped. Like he was going to lunge at me any second, like he could sense my smell, the taste of fresh flesh on my bones ready for him to tear off. He looked normal enough, talked like usual, with a brow raised and the slight curve of a smirk on his lips. But I didn’t see intense hunger in his eyes. I didn’t see anything predatory. 

Kaz seemed like himself, like the guy I’d been living with for almost two years. And somehow, that made it worse. That made them good actors. Rowan and Immie were exactly the same, becoming the perfect mimic’s of the people I had grown to love. 

It was around midnight when I dragged myself down the stairs, shouldering a backpack of everything I could pack on such short notice. Yanking open the door and stepping over the threshold, I sucked in the cool night air. Before I could step out, however, a chuckle startled me. Rowan. Standing in his robe, dark brown curls sticking up everywhere, he regarded me with dark eyes—and just for a moment, I wondered if he was going to drop the act.

Out of the three of them, Rowan was the one who was struggling with the façade. I hadn’t forgotten the look of resentment and hatred he’d given me on the night of the full moon. The real him. Relief flooded me at the thought of him giving in and finally ripping off the mask. Instead, though, he folded his arms across his chest and took a step forward, still with that smile. A smile I knew was a grimace. Rowan really wasn’t trying to hide his disdain for me.

Instinctively, I took one back.

And like clockwork, he took another step forward, and another, until I could smell the coffee on his breath.

“It’s quarter to twelve at night,” Rowan said. If he noticed my panicked steps back, he didn’t say anything. “Where are you going?”

“The store.” I replied smoothly. “I need some fresh air.”

Rowan cocked his head, his lip curling.  “At midnight?”

The door slammed shut in my face, and I resisted against a shriek.

“Yeah.” I hissed out. “I’m gonna get some food.”

“Hungry?” He gestured behind him, “Dude, Kaz just made veggie lasagne. Don’t you want that?”

“No.” I said, “I’m not hungry.”

“Uh-huh.” His lip curled. “So, what are you going to the store for?”

The gleam in his eye was driving me crazy. His whole expression, every contortion in his face, was challenging me to make more excuses. The conversation was going nowhere, and somehow I could tell he was loving it; he was loving the fact that I was trembling, trying to stay calm, trying to stable my body. “Candy.” I said through my teeth. “I’m going to get some candy.”

Rowan hummed, an almost genuine smile pricking. I might have fallen for it if it wasn’t for how close he was standing to me, how he was cornering me. “Sweet. Get me some, would ya? There’s something about those gummy snakes that seriously slap.” He raised his hand in a salute, his gaze flicking to my backpack. He knew. I knew he knew, and yet he wasn’t saying anything. He was playing with me. “Hurry back, alright? There’s some freaks out there, Nin. We don’t want you getting hurt now, do we?"

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine, and I forced a smile back.

Every instinct inside me told me to run. I had to get out. Away from him. From his coffee breath turning my gut, his erratic movements like he was ready to tear out my throat at any moment. I felt my body moving, my legs starting to work. One step—and then another. I turned away from him. It took one single breath to reach the door, and another to remember how to grab the handle and twist it. 

He was coming after me, I thought, my mind going into overdrive. I imagined his footsteps, his heavy breath as he wrapped his hand around my arm and yanked me back inside. I forced my legs further until I was halfway down the path, revelling in the cool night air grazing my arms. When I pushed open the rickety gate which squealed under pressure, I risked turning back, my heart in my throat. In my head, Rowan was a monster bleeding back into the dark.

Turning around to face the house, though, there was nobody there. The door was still open, the hallway lit up in all too familiar golden light. But Rowan was gone. When I squinted, I could just about glimpse his figure moving back up the stairs in slow, almost defeated strides. Something held me there for a second, staring at the house I always saw as a home—and people I saw as family. Before I turned and finally threw myself into a run. It’s not like I could go back to my parents house.

They live across the state, and it was the middle of the night. I had a friend from classes. Sam. We used to be close, but a while ago he started to distance himself, only smiling at me in passing. 

We had gone from hanging out almost every day to barely talking, and I figured it was just natural for a friendship to crumble. Even if I didn’t want it to. Sam got new friends, and I moved out of my dorms. I guess it was a part of college life to say goodbye to old friends and make new ones. Still though, the idea of awkwardly asking Sam to stay at his place made me feel nauseous. We hadn’t spoken in months. The last communication we had was a meme via text. It was either Sam’s house or sleeping on the streets. 

Making a fool out of myself, it was. 

Sam lived in a large build with ivy crawling up red-brick. It was fancy. The house was old and crumbling, but cosy. I remembered freshman days, sitting under the late glow of the sun, the two of us spread out on a worn picnic blanket watching the July 4th fireworks in the sky. Before I could hesitate, I knocked three times. The window’s were dark, so that wasn’t exactly comforting.

Sam used to leave the door open so I could slip in whenever I wanted. Seeing it locked in front of my face made my stomach twist. Sure, it was midnight.

I wouldn’t expect any door to be wide open at that time. But I’m pretty sure if it was daylight, it would still be shut. What happened? That’s what I wanted to ask him. But trying to connect with a friend who had made every opportunity to cut you out of their life—stung. It really fucking hurt. So, I gave up. I gave up trying, because why should I? 

Sam’s place looked rundown compared to when I first saw it. The grass in the yard looked overgrown, the flower garden I knew Sam’s housemate treasured, was full of weeds, rose’s withering away.

I was frowning at a decaying dandelion when the door opened, and a pixie redhead stuck her head out. I recognised her automatically. Poppy. Sam’s housemate. I had grown used to her over the top smiles and obsession with mini cacti, as well as her competitive attitude, but this girl seemed like a different person. A lot more mature. Taller. 

There was something else. Something I couldn’t put my finger on. The girl was fully dressed in a leather jacket over jeans and shirt, her collar glistening from the downpour I’d managed to miss. Half lidded eyes drank me in for a moment like she was in a daze before she seemingly snapped out of it, yanking the door open. “Nin?” Poppy’s gaze snapped to my feet. 

“Why are you barefoot?”

I stared down at my feet, and she was right. I didn’t even put on shoes. The worst part is I barely felt the rough gravel between my toes and bare soles. I was numb on adrenaline. I shook my head with what I hoped was a smile. “Hey, Poppy. Is Sam in?”

Something flashed across her face, and it was so fast I could barely read it. Poppy was quick to hide it with a smile. “He’s kind of busy right now.” Her attention went back to my feet. “More importantly, why are you running around with no shoes on?”

Before I could get out some kind of answer, the girl gestured me inside. “Get inside! Jesus, Nin, your feet!”

I managed a smile, stepping into the hallway. The house was exactly how I remembered it. Homely. Safe.

“Thanks.”

“What do you need Sam for?” Poppy asked, shutting and locking the door.

I shrugged, shivering. I didn’t realise how cold I was until I stepped into warmth. “Just to talk to him.”

“About? You ran across campus to talk?” Her smile was teasing, and I’d missed it. “Dude, have you heard of texting?”

“I’m kind of locked out.”

Poppy’s smile faded. “Ah. Well, that explains your feet. You’ve always got a home here if you’re ever in trouble. Your bro’s in the lounge.” Handing me a pair of socks I was grateful for, the girl led me into their kitchen and plonked a can of soda on the table in front of me. It was just like the old days. Poppy and I would hang in the kitchen drinking while Sam took a millennia to get ready. “You drink that. I'll drag Sam away from his game.” 

She rolled her eyes, pulling open the refrigerator and pulling out a beer, cracking it open and taking a sip. Poppy exhaled. “They’re in the middle of a tournament. It started last night, and it’s still going. You’d think grown adults would do something more interesting with their time, but alas, I digress. I’ve been trying to sleep for the last few hours, but they’re pretty loud. I just block them out with whatever’s on Netflix.”

Cracking open the can, I took a sip of my soda. “Tournament?” I said through a mouthful. I couldn’t help noticing her attire, and her words about not being able to sleep suddenly didn’t make any sense. What, was she sleeping fully dressed?

Poppy smirked, perching herself on the edge of the table. “Just a nerd game.” She replied. “Sam’s friends are quite… odd.”

I nodded at her jacket. “Have you been outside?”

“Outside?” Her expression crumpled before she noticed her jacket still glistening. “Oh. Oh, yeah. I went for a walk.” Poppy grabbed her beer. “Hey, why don’t we head into the lounge instead, huh? I’m sure Sam wouldn’t mind us interrupting him.”

She spun around to grab my arm, her eyes shining with mischief. “Besides! Sammy’s friends have been here long enough.”

When she pulled me into the lounge, I caught a glimpse of… something.

I didn’t get to see much. Just enough to know whatever was going on, it wasn’t some Dungeons and Dragons style game.  

I only saw paper strewn across the table. A group of people, including Sam, had been gathered around, with one of them marking something on the paper. 

Sam’s other housemates were nowhere to be seen. When Poppy had walked in, dragging me with her, the group had been quick to turn and try and block me from seeing what it was they were doing, others hurriedly clearing up paper and shutting laptop’s. It felt like I’d just walked into something I wasn’t supposed to see. Poppy, on the other hand, seemed delighted at their reaction. “Sam.” She sang, leaning against the door with a smile. “You have a visitor.”

Sam looked different too. Again, not something I could put my finger on, light sandy hair tied into its usual clumsy ponytail.

The look on his face didn’t make sense. I’d never seen Sam look so flustered. His eyes cartoonishly wide eyes blinking at me like I was a hallucination. Like Poppy, he too was fully dressed. Sam said something to the group in a low murmur, before they crowded around, grabbing stained coffee mugs and bits of paper, clearing up the table.

Poppy, who had slumped into a beanbag, shot me a grin. “Holy shit, you actually got rid of them.”

The girl stretched out like a cat, squealing when Sam threw a cushion at her. “We finally have our house back!”

“You know I have the lounge until two.” He retorted, clearing up the table.

Poppy groaned, mimicking his voice, her body moulding into the bean-bag. “You know I have the lounge until two.”

“What did I tell you about mimicking me?”

The girl chuckled. “Hey, it’s fun.”

“It’s not fun when you sound absolutely nothing like me.”

“Cry about it, Sammy.”

Their back and forth reminded me of my own housemates.

His lip curled into the slightest of smiles, and he picked up another cushion to throw. “Poppy.”

“Sam.” She shot back in a mocking exaggeration of his accent.

Sam’s accent never failed to take me by surprise. Hard Aussie. When I first met him I could barely understand him.

It didn’t help that upon first meeting him, he talked like he’d been fast forwarded.

Originally from Victoria, Sam Fuller was my first friend. That’s how we became close, actually. His amusement at my failure to understand him. Poppy folded her arms, her gaze trailing after the group filing out of the room. They were mixed ages, though none of them were Sam’s. They all looked to be middle aged to ancient. I glimpsed a woman who looked to be at least 70 stride to the door. “Don’t give me that look.” Poppy said. “Your weird friends can find another meeting place for your games. I want to sleep. Allie and Tom have locked themselves in their rooms since you decided to invite the whole town.”

“They’re not weird games.” Sam shooed Poppy out of the room. “Don’t you have work to do?”

“Yes.” Poppy nodded at me. “I’ll make you another drink.” Her gaze fell on Sam. “Beer?”

He grinned. “That’d be great."

“Awesome!” Poppy playfully hit him. “Get one yourself. You’re a big boy, aren’t cha? I’ll be in my room!”

Ignoring Poppy slamming the door behind her, Sam’s attention flicked to me. “Nin, what are you doing here?”

I couldn’t help it, the words slipping out before I could stop them. “Who were they?”

Sam dragged his hands through his hair. “Just friends.” His expression softened, and the knot in my gut loosened.

“You look like shit, Nin. What happened?”

I figured telling him a diluted version of the night of the full moon was better—so I didn’t sound out of my mind.  By the time I was finished explaining, the two of us were curled up on his bed in front of his laptop playing YouTube video’s on low. Poppy had lent me some clothes to sleep in, and I was ready to pass out. Sam sat in front of me, his arms wrapped around his knees. 

“So, your housemates got you freaked?” He frowned, his sleepy eyes on me. “What did they do?”

Cannibalise my body. I thought dizzily.

No, worse. They weren’t just eating me.

They were replicating me, so they could eat me—again, and again.

“They were just acting weird.” I said.

“Weird how?”

When I lifted my head, something in Sam’s eyes had changed, a glint I’d never seen before. His whole expression seemed to contort. “What do you mean by that?” He asked, and when I took too long to reply, Sam shook me. “Nin. In what way?”

Hours later, when I was falling asleep, and Sam was watching YouTube, he nudged me.

“Nin?”

“Mm?” I mumbled into his pillow.

“Where do you live now? Like, which house?”

“It’s just down the road from here.”

He hummed. “And these housemates… who are they again?”

I didn’t answer him.

I mean, I couldn’t.

Their names were entangled on my tongue whenever I tried.

Sam asked me the same question day after day, and the words tangled in my throat. I told him it was a prank gone wrong, and that seemed to appease him. But I caught his wary looks, his lips curling into a scowl. A week flew by in a confusing blur, and I went to class as usual, staying at Sam’s until I could find a place more permanent. Much to Poppy’s delight, Sam didn’t invite his friends over again. 

Instead, he insisted on video games and takeout every night, with Allie and Tom, their other housemates, eventually joining. 

It was like freshman year again, and I found myself drowning out the thoughts and questions still haunting me with alcohol and drunken games of Cards Against Humanity. Classes were more or less the same, but they were a good distraction. I got texts and missed calls from Immie, and Kaz and Rowan were blowing up the group chat with messages, but I muted it and ignored my phone. 

There would be a point when I’d go back, I thought. After all, I had to know what was wrong with them, why the moon afflicted that kind of behaviour, and just what exactly had they done to me?  

But it wouldn’t be yet. I can’t remember what day it was when I fully came to reality, badly hungover and feeling sick to my stomach. Class was ending, and as usual I filed out of the hall, heading to where Sam and usually met me before heading to his house. My head was spinning, a striking pain rattling my skull. 

I’d suffered from hangover headaches before, but this was something new. Swallowing two Tylenol with cold coffee I’d had in my backpack all day wasn’t a good idea. Slumping down on the stairs leading down to the main reception, I fought against a cry. The pain was like nothing I’d felt before, like someone had plunged a led pipe through my brain and stirred my brain into a soupy mess. Luckily, Sam joined me quickly, his smile dampening when he saw my expression. “Oh, man.” He felt my forehead. “You look like you’re going to barf everywhere.”

Despite the pain, I managed a smile. “Do I look like a zombie?”

I could practically hear the cogs in his head turning. Sam dragged a hand through his hair. “Uh, will you hit me if I say yes?”

I shooed him away when he held up his hand. “How many fingers am I holding up?”

“Ten.” I rolled my eyes. I meant to say that we should head down the stairs, because I was feeling progressively sicker by the second, and I felt like I was going to faint, the world around me becoming a blur of colours and faint noises I could barely decipher. But a loud slam pricked my ears. 

It didn’t seem to alert the crowd of students, merely a whisper in a room full of loud chatter and laughter. To me though, it was a sound I knew all too well. Lifting my head, I scanned the crowd enveloping the hallway. Sam was speaking behind me, but his voice collapsed into a low buzz of white noise bleeding into my brain. I knew that sound. The sound of skin hitting glass, or wood, sometimes plastic. I looked for the source of the sound, my housemate, who was chronically clumsy, but there was no sign of him. Turning back to Sam, I opened my mouth to tell him we should go, but Rowan seemed to bleed from the crowd straight into my peripheral. 

He wasn't what you would expect a monster to look like-- especially a monster you knew had already killed and eaten you multiple times. He just looked like a college student, a dazed college student, who had just slammed head-first into the automatic door, judging from the red bruise blooming in the middle of his forehead. Rowan looked the same from a distance, bearing his usual clothes, a mess of t-shirt and jeans, his hair unbrushed under a baseball cap. But when he got closer, I noticed something not quite right. Something which highlighted what I thought I'd hallucinated. He was pale. Really fucking pale.

His cheeks looked hollow, gaunt even. 

Like something was sucking the life from him. When he stepped in front of me, his penetrating gaze hidden behind a pair of raybans, my mediocre lunch crept up my throat. He was still wearing his mask, still mimicking my best friend. 

Hiding whatever spell he was under.

He was oozing broke college student who hadn’t showered in days. In his hand was a to-go cup of hot cocoa--which was my favourite. Rowan knew that. It had been my Starbucks order every time we studied there as a four.  When he handed over the Starbucks cup, I noticed his hand was trembling. He could barely hold on to it. “Yooo, Nin.” Rowan’s words were slurred slightly when he handed me the drink, and he stumbled, managing to right himself.  

He wasn’t moon-drunk, I thought.

Actually drunk.

“Hey.” Sam nudged me. I noticed he’d stiffened up. “Your housemate… is Rowan Fucking Beck?”

I didn’t get chance to reply, with Rowan situating himself right in front of me, swaying a little.

“Now call me crazy,” My housemate said. “But I’m getting the vibe you’re avoiding us.”

I took the drink hesitantly. “Are you drunk?” I managed through a scorching sip.

Rowan cocked his head. He had that stupid smile again. The one he pulled during a full moon. Outside though, it was daylight, the sun shining in the sky.  “Nah man, I just feel kinda shit.” He shrugged. “I haven’t been eating great the last few days.”

He nodded to me, his lips curving into a smirk. “Not eating can fuck a guy up. Right Nin?”

Every word penetrated like a knife, and suddenly it was hard to fucking breathe.

My housemate turned to Sam. “Ooh, I know you! You’re the guy who wrote that article about us!” His tone dripped with sarcasm. “Loved it, Fuller. Especially when you called us ‘evil body snatching demons’ who should be burned at the stake.”

Rowan’s words twisted my gut. 

Sam’s expression stayed stoic. “Rowan.” He said my housemate’s name like poison. “Where’s Kaz?”

“Playing COD, probably.” My housemate’s lip pricked. “Do you want me to pass a message to him, or…?”

Sam stepped back. “Nin, I gotta go." He said, pulling out his phone. “I’ll speak to you later.”

“Right.” I panicked. “Am I still okay to stay?”

“I’m.. I’m busy.” Sam nodded at me, ignoring Rowan, before stumbling back into the crowd. “Come by later, alright?”

He was gone before I could open my mouth.

“Aww, boo.” Rowan mocked a pout. “Damn. I was really excited about his next article.” He saluted Sam. “Speaking of excitement, Immie is cooking tonight. She’s bought all the ingredients for something she saw on Pinterest, so I’m not holding my breath that it’ll be good—or even edible.” I didn’t fight back when he slipped his hand in mine, pulling me down the stairs. My housemate twisted around to smile at me. “Okay, you got me. I should probably apologise about the other night.”

I was already backing away, pulling away from him.

“I don’t care what you have to say.” I said in a breath. “I’m staying with my parents.”

“You mean halfway across state?” Rowan’s hand wrapped around my arm. "Come on. We just want to talk.”

“Talk?”

That got my attention. Following him to his car parked out front, I slipped into the passenger seat.

I was aware I was following the big bad wolf into the forest, every horror movie cliché.

But what other choice did I have?

I needed answers. Maybe he was finally going to tell me what the fuck was going on. Rowan was still my housemate.

I had lived with him for two years—as well as Immie and Kaz. I needed to know what was going with them. Why they were like this. And why, according to him, this was my fault. Rowan jumped into the driver’s seat and started the car, dragging his hand through his hair. “Yeah.” He said. “I mean, once again we left you on a full moon—and I bet it sucked. But hey,” He chuckled. “At least you didn’t see us moon-drunk again.” My housemate sent me a mocking look, “Wait, did you? Oh, man, what did I do this time? The last thing I remember is playing Monopoly, and I think at some point I cuffed you to your bed.”

Twisting around to face him, my heart slithered into my throat. The bastard was still playing his games.

“You’re still saying that?” I hissed. “Moon drunk?”

Rowan’s gaze didn’t leave the road. “I mean, yeah.” He murmured, “You said we freak you out, so we keep our distance.”

Rowan didn’t speak for most of the ride, and I spent the majority of it trying to find out how to jump out of a moving car without seriously injuring myself. My phone vibrated and I pulled it out, glimpsing a text heading my notifications bar.

Sam: Sent: 4:05PM.

“That thing is NOT Rowan Beck. Get out of that house.”

Another message:

Sam: Sent: 4:06PM: “GET OUT, NIN. GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE.”

Instinctively, I grabbed for the handle, pawing for a way out. I felt like I was on fire and felt my body moving closer to the door, leaning into it, as if it would magically fucking open for me. “You okay?” Rowan murmured. He slipped off his raybans and turned to me. That same gleam was in his eyes, that sliver of moonlight. He looked worse without the raybans, bloodshot eyes, a mixture of burst blood vessels and moonlight haloing his iris. My housemate looked beautiful and horrifying at the same time, a mixture of human and inhuman; the shell of the guy I thought I knew filled with her. But there was something else, something I didn’t understand. 

His skin looked… cracked. Like it was splintering apart. And in those cracks was what I imagined pins and needles to look like. Static. There was static leaking from the cracks, spider webbing across his pasty skin. Rowan sighed when I couldn’t bring myself to answer. “You know,” he said, his hands tapping the steering wheel. "Eating makes me feel better. It... “ He took a long breath, choking on a laugh. “Well, it takes the memories away, you know? Makes me feel so fucking good. When I eat, I stop thinking. Because thinking is bad. Immie and Kaz can’t even stand up right now. They’re at home, fighting to breathe. Luckily, though, there was some of you left in my room. Just some skull and intestine I had left over for a party,” Rowan hummed. 

“You would not believe how good the human skull tastes mixed with intestines. Oh my god, the crunch! It's honestly orgasmic. Damn, you taste good."

When I grabbed for the door handle, his arm whipped out, pinning me to the seat, his hand staying on the wheel. His gaze stayed on the road. He was unsurprisingly strong, his heavy weight restraining me against cool leather. “The flesh under Kaz’s bed is good. I mean, it’s a little soggy and gross on the outside. It’s not peak meat, but it’s alright. If you ask me honestly, I’d say I prefer you refrigerated.” His lips split into a grin. “And we’re saving those for a good game of Smash.”

“Rowan.” I heard myself say his name, straining against his arm.

“You said we should talk.” He deadpanned, stopping at a light. Outside, the world went by as normal, the evening rush hour flying by in a blur of vivid reds and oranges. “So, that’s what we’re going to do.”

Words appeared in my throat, but they wouldn’t form on my tongue. He surprised me with a laugh. And with that laugh, his façade was shattered. He’d finally ripped off his mask. “Why did you have to come downstairs?” Rowan finally twisted to me, his lips curled into a grin, his eyes telling a different story. So many emotions. Past emotions. Emotions from a time ripped from my memory. Hatred and pain, anger and something else entirely I couldn’t read. 

“All you had to do was stay in your fucking room, and we wouldn’t have to… have to remember. We could go on living together. You, me, Kaz and Immie. And yeah, when I’m agitated or it’s nearing totality, I start to remember pieces of it. Why I… why I fucking despise you, Nin.” He was trembling, and when I dared look, his skin was slowly coming apart, a cocktail of moonlight and static pouring out.

I was frozen. I couldn’t fucking move. Rowan grabbed the wheel with both hands, his knuckles turning white. He’d let me go, but I couldn’t bring myself to move. Not when he’d said that. Not when his words had stirred something in me. Still though, he kept speaking—like him—the real him—had been silenced for so long, and here he was, letting it all out. “She takes all the bad away.” He whispered. “As long as we eat, I don’t feel anything at all. I don’t have to fucking think, and breathe, and look at you without rose tinted glasses and a foggy brain. It’s… it’s fucking bliss. Like I’m drowning.” Rowan shook hair out of his eyes. “Not now.” He said. “Now, she’s… she’s punishing me because I haven’t eaten.” 

The car swerved around a truck, and I fought against my own body, fighting to grab the wheel. But I was frozen. “Now, I remember.” His tone was poison spitting from his tongue. “She made us remember, and it’s… it’s fucking there in my head,” His voice strained, and he stabbed at his left temple. “Right here! It’s right fucking here, Nin, and I can’t… I can’t stop it. I can’t stop her. She’s in my... my head.”

Rowan didn’t look at me. In fact, he was actively avoiding making eye contact. Tears were welling in his eyes, hysterical tears leaking that same buzzing static. “She’s in my fucking head. Always in my head. Singing, man. Singing at the top of her voice.”

“What did I do?” I didn’t mean to say it. 

The words were dragged from my mouth forcefully. The car swerved again, and I braced myself against the seat. “Rowan, you keep telling me I did something.” I managed. “Why can’t you tell me?”

My housemate turned to me, his eyes filled with that unearthly light I knew he’d been trying to avoid for months.

“Why do you think?” His smile was suddenly maniacal. Not his. Someone else’s. “Because it’s fun!”

This time I did grab for the wheel, trying to shove him from his seat. “Stop the car.”

Rowan easily got the upper hand, grasping it. “No. Like I said, we’re going home. And.. and we’re going to talk.”

It was me who laughed this time. “Talk?” I spluttered. “You mean eat me. Copy me. Whatever you do.”

I couldn’t control my emotions. I laughed. It felt good. "You three suck at being serial killers.”

I managed to take him off guard for a moment. He blinked before regaining control. “It’s not… like that. Jesus fucking Christ.”

Focusing on the road, I took a sharp breath. I just had to wait for him to slow down, pull open the door, and jump out. "Then what is it?” I spat back, days of repressed emotions rushing to the surface. “I catch you fucking eating me, and what am I supposed to think? Did you guys seriously think I’d just go along with whatever this is? Are you trying to shield me, is that it?” I was laughing, and I couldn’t stop. And at that moment I realised we were both under her spell. 

Both of us were screaming at each other. Rowan, leaking her light, and me, bathing in it. It hit me, then, that I was as inhuman as him. Whatever the moon had done, it was affecting both of us. I just didn’t have the cannibalistic tendencies he had. “I caught you chewing on my guts, what do you think you can shield me from?” When Rowan didn’t reply, I shoved him. “Shield me from what exactly?”

Rowan surprised me with a scoff. “Shield you?” He turned to me fully, and I realised, my stomach creeping into my throat, that he wasn’t looking at the road. “Are you fucking kidding me?” My housemate choked out. “I want you to remember!” He yelled. “Do you think I like looking at you, knowing that you’re completely oblivious about what you… about what you did to us? No, it fucking hurts! It hurts so fucking much that I want to wring your throat every time you come into the room. And that’s why I eat, Nin. That’s why we eat. She numbs those feelings. Those thoughts. She only makes us think about the good.”

When his hands slammed into the steering wheel, I finally caught a sliver of humanity coming back to fruition on his face.

My hand slipped from the handle, and I heard myself speak. “What?”

But Rowan’s eyes were on the road again. He squinted, and reality seeped in. “What the fuck is that?”

“Huh?” I whispered, following his gaze. I saw nothing. No longer on the main road, we were heading into darkness, an empty stretch of oblivion I didn’t recognise. There were no sign of cars. I swallowed. “Rowan, what is it? What did you see?”

My housemate shook his head, blinking rapidly. “Nothing.” He said. “I think I’m… seeing things—”

Whatever Rowan was about to say was cut off suddenly, followed by a blinding flash which felt and sounded like a nuke had been dropped in front of us. At that moment it was like staring into the core of the sun. Something was there, blinding me, searing my eyes from my skull. But I had no time to scream, no time to think—to breathe. Before I could, my mind was working, and dizzying thoughts were hitting me. I was aware. All too aware suddenly. Our car had hit something, and that something was powerful enough to propel me into the air. 

The world was shattering around me, my body caught in a whirlwind. I was flying, twisting, twirling through a cloud of fire licking across my flesh and searing into my bones, my hair singing from my scalp, screaming into fire in my lungs. 

The sensations were too real, too real to be feeling them. I wasn’t supposed to feel this. I wasn’t supposed to feel my body being ripped apart, and still be self-aware enough to screech into nothing, a nothing which existed when my head had been ripped from my torso. I waited to die. 

Without a brain, without a body, I waited for the dark. And yet somehow, I didn’t fall fully. Instead of plunging into the dark, my body was still mine.

It still had a head.

A torso.

It was still mine when it hit something with a sickening crack.

Concrete.

I was aware my eyes were snapping open for a moment, something wet and warm spreading around me and pooling from my lips. My vision was blurry, too blurry to make sense of anything. I watched my eyelashes flickering, like they were unsure what to do. I could feel my broken self, shattered beyond repair. I don’t remember the exact time I died. I think my body was  mending the trauma, or at least trying to, but my head had hit solid concrete, triggering a brain haemorrhage.

It was the 28th time I’d died, and this was the first time I realty felt it. I felt the sensation of darkness swallowing me up, for real, before whatever had taken me choked me back out. Awareness came quickly, reality bleeding back into focus. I wasn’t where I’d landed on my back after being propelled from the car in the crash. 

Now I was lying on my stomach. Something tickled my face. Grass. I was lying face down in grass.  I can’t describe the sensation it was to wake up only being part real. When I sat up, I felt real. I felt like I was part of this universe. But looking down at myself, I looked more like a ghost, that same static bleeding from Rowan’s face making me up, stitching me back together. My body was a brand new copy of the me before the crash. I even saw the coffee stain on my shirt. The smear of pen I’d drawn on the back of my hand when I was bored in class.

I felt nothing. Like I was made of stars. Hollow.

Something was missing, though, a cavern in my mind beginning its purge.

Do you know when you wake up from a dream, and it slips away as you regain consciousness?

That’s what it felt like. Like everything which had happened, the crash, everything Rowan said—was a dream.

When I felt more like myself, and when my fingertips could touch real objects, wet gravel and grass, my own skin, I shakily got to my feet. I found my old body at the side of the road. I’d bled out, just like I thought. My eyes were still open. When I crawled over to it, I couldn’t resist, grasping hold of her hand, only to get a—flash. Like I was seeing her POV. 

She was my old body’s memories. I saw Rowan’s expression, his skin splintering apart, his eyes filled with moonlight. I saw him struggling with the wheel, and then the crash. Letting go of her ice-cold hand, I let out a sharp breath, her memories flashing out of existence. I didn’t have time to think about what I’d seen—about the questions piling in my skull, taking over my thoughts. 

Rowan’s body was still in the car, his body twisted like a pretzel, my housemate’s head smashed against the wheel spattered an intense red. 

When I felt for a pulse, it was still faint, but it was barely there as sharp red pooled around him, sticking to his hair and drenching his skin and clothes. When I crawled out of the wreck of his car, my gaze found what was in front of me. What Rowan had seen, and what we had crashed into. It glittered in the setting sun, slicing into the road, invisible from a distance, but all too real when I took slow steps towards it and reached out a shaky hand to touch it.

It was the same colour as the moon, that unearthly light filling Rowan’s eyes. I was so transfixed by the wall, the barrier spanning across the road, I barely noticed that sound again. This time it was louder, completely unmistakable. The sound of a photograph being taken.

When that light filled my eyes once again, I turned away from the barrier, blinking through intense light. It was at the back-end of that sound, the sound of a photo snapping reality and stealing away a moment, when I glimpsed the body seemingly bleeding into existence right in front of me. Like a polaroid coming to life. Stumbling over to him, I found Rowan curled into himself, and like me, he was made up of static, which became flesh, which became skin, spreading across him, making a perfect copy, an exact replica of the dead guy in the wreck. 

Hesitantly, I reached out and brushed dark curls out of the way, hair which was still shadows and shapes seeping into reality. This time the number 3 was carved into his skin—and by the look of it, the number was fresh, only just coming into existence. 

After a moment of just… watching him, watching my housemate be brought to life, his chest starting to rise and fall, his eyelids flickering, lips parting, I got a hold of myself and tried to grab him.

But when I was sure my hands had made contact with him, flesh with flesh, something smashed into the back of my head, and stars filled my vision. 

I hit the ground.

Someone’s arms wrapped around me. 

Not Rowan.

A stranger.

I was being dragged, my bare arms burning across rough concrete, before a shadow was looming over me.

And a foot was slamming down on my head.

… 

Sorry, I’ve hit the word-limit. I’ll be back in a few days to continue. Honestly, this gives me time to breathe. Jesus.

Hi all, 

I really don’t write well, or at all. I usually don’t post or do a whole lot on here, especially this specific subreddit as I live a fairly mundane life and don’t do a whole lot apart from hang out with my friends but something them I did today is making me feel sick.


One of my friends I see every day, we live 2 seconds from each-other, ride the same bus to school, hang out in the mornings. The other lives about 30 minutes away,  and goes to a different school, so I don’t see him often. When we do see each-other, we make it a two day event, we get snacks, play games, stay up all night and have a genuinely good time. Usually one leaves early in the morning and the other and I go hang out in the nice little clearing in the forest by my townhouse. It’s a usual hangout spot for the kids in the neighborhood and the teenagers that go there to smoke, and it’s split into two sections, the right and left side. The right side is a small path that leads to a lake, and the left is a smaller path that leads to a perfect circle with a path leading the complex over. These have been like this since I moved in 6 years ago and never changed until today. 


This morning my buddy, call him M left early in the morning to go home, so me and my other friend, B and I went to the woods. We were just hanging out and chilling by the lake when I noticed a new deviation from the circular path going up into a hill but I couldn’t see what was back there past the trees. B and I are stupid, so we decided to explore. When we got up there we found the gated off area and a new clearing, with a grate tied to a tree acting like a door. B and I got curious so we went inside and chilled out. Now someone was here recently, cause there was a makeshift fireplace but that’s not what gave me a bad feeling. 


On the tree opposite the makeshift fireplace there was a green rope with some weird stains on it, not blood but like, goopy orange, kind of like sap. Weirdest part being is that it’s autumn and our trees are so dead the don’t produce sap. B didn’t really care and started building a hut. I ignored my bad feeling but M had woken up so we went to his house to get him and bring him back, because he’s much bigger than us and B started to get a bad feeling.


When we got M we walked back into the grated off area and they started building, but I had an awful feeling. I was hearing weird shit and random wooshes, like footsteps in a place where nobody else was around. 


A fact about me is my ears hear really weird, weird pitches others can’t hear,  and I swear the entire time we were in there, I heard a sort of whir. Somewhat like a helicopter taking off but higher, basically a very high rotation speed sound. I started to lose my sense of constant, kind of like when your coming down off of a high and you just space out. Across from this was an island, and this was the most horrifying thing I saw. I shit you not, I saw three smiling faces peering at me from that forest. They didn’t move, the didn’t blink, they didn’t budge. Three smiling faces that did not have any defining features, no wrinkles hair, no pupils. I looked away but they were still there. I don’t scare easily but I almost pissed myself. I could not look away, I literally tried but I couldn’t because I felt cold. Freezing.


As soon I knew it, B was tapping me on the shoulder and he had to leave. M and I walked back his house, and B left. Nobody else had seen or experienced what I saw. Or they ignored it. That really fucking bothers me because they know how I am. 


Ever since I’ve gotten home, I’ve felt sick to my stomach. I feel like something has changed around me. I kind of feel like I’m in a bubble. I keep coming to weird conciousness in random places of my house, and seeing random shadows in the corner of my eye, and weird outlines kind of like cellophane in reflections. My friends want to return next week, but I feel like we went somewhere we were just not meant to go. I mean I get I live in a bad place, and I could have gone to a drug hangout and picked up residue of something that made me hallucinate, but something rubbed me the wrong way about it and it was genuinely scary for me. 


I’m gonna buy a trail cam and see what happens there overnight. I just want to know if anyone knows what this might be or if anyone else has seen something like this. I plan to update with whatever I find.

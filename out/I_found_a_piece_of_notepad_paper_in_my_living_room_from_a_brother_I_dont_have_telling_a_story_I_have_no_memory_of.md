I read it all, and have wrote it all out as I did so. "Growing in our local apple orchard are many delicious berries that my brother and I enjoy eating, but one particular plant we've never touched as we didn't know what species it was. The berries are all vaguely humanoid shaped. The colours vary with each as well. One day my brother warned me not to ever even think about eating those berries, as not only could they have been poisonous but also because he suffered sleep paralysis the night before from thinking about what they tasted like. I told him though that paralysis was caused by eating too much berries and other food, his diet was truly terrible and not to mention the drinking habits, so I wasn't surprised he had yet another case of this.

But he continued, telling me he hallucinated something appearing in the house he could only describe as "frightening beyond anything imaginable." However, whatever this thing was he then added "it was just the beginning." Well, that freaked me out even though I knew he was dreaming. Our parents went to bed early that night so we both decided to also get to sleep as we didn't like feeling alone in the house at night. I collected in a bowl some delicious fruit and other food from our fridge to keep by my bedside, scoffing a few instantly. I find that if I wake up during the night from nightmares a little bite helps make me feel better and fall asleep again. I slept wonderfully that night, warm blanket over me, bed as soft as could be, I fell into dreamless sleep.

And then I awoke, despite having no dreams something had got me up. I heard something from downstairs which must have done it. It sounded like a long creak from the living room. The door I thought, the wind from a window must have been making that happen. I had some of the food then tried to go back to sleep again, but I was distracted by what sounded like wind, but it wasn't from outside, it was from the living room where the creak came from. It was at this exact point I remembered doing what my parents told me to do before they went to bed, make sure all the windows were shut, including the living room.

Then there was another creak, and the sound of wind stopped. From listening carefully I realised that the living room door was not the one that had opened as I knew it sounded different as well as being from the opposite side of the room. This creak was the living room closet. I didn't know why the wind had stopped though or how it got there in the first place if the windows were locked. There was no fireplace where it could have come from either.

And then they began. The gentle smaller creaks of feet stepping away from the closet. "Brother just messing with me, brother just messing with me, brother just messing with me..." I whispered to reassure myself as the footsteps moved to the downstairs entrance hall of my house, with no sound of the living room door opening. Then they changed in tone, and I knew why, they had begun climbing the stairway to upstairs which was soft unlike the downstairs floor. They stopped when they reached the final step, as I remember counting the steps as I climbed them as a kid and there was fifteen. They had reached the top hallway where my room, my brother's room, the master bedroom and bathroom were. My room and the bathroom were on the left side, and they became louder and louder, they were coming towards me.

I didn't want to hear anymore and hid under my covers, clutching one hand into a fist. As I did so some peelings from the food I ate earlier fell on me, and in the small beam of moonlight entering my room and under a gap in the covers I saw a strange shape, a humanoid shape. I had eaten one of the berries, my brother had left it in the fridge when I was gathering food. Then the footsteps stopped a few feet from my bed. My door was shut but I didn't hear it open. I wanted to confront my brother for this cruel prank and after a minutue of gathering up the courage I carefully lifted my blanket to see him.

He was not there, but instead, illuminated by the moon, were three figures as tall as him, all humanoid like the berries. It was hard to make out their colours but I could see they all wore traditional looking attire like from more than a hundred years ago. One had a big smile that looked like one stroke of a paintbrush, one had just a thin black line for a mouth and one no mouth at all. Each did have eyes that looked like drawings of people's eyes but without too much detail. The smiling one had hair of some bright colour that was wavy and long like spahgetti, the mouthless one wearing a sort of top hat and the other some fur like a mane. Their bodies all had human proportions wearing smart attire like rich people would in the past.

I felt no fear or any emotion at all and the next thing I knew was that I was downstairs again, unable to move. We were in the living room where the closet opened again, and from here I felt and heard the wind from earlier. Then it all went dark.

Now I am here in a small confined space where I can see the three figures above behind glass and behind them more plants growing the berries my brother warned me about. I'm stuck here with nothing but whatever scraps of food they give me. I had a notepad and pencil in my pyjama pocket that I used to write down my dreams, and thanks to this I was able to tell this story. I put the paper in a small window in my cell where I recieve fresh air, I assume from outside wherever this place is. It's far too small for me to get in but not for my paper. I doubt though that whoever finds this paper will ever find out where I am, but I can only warn you never to eat those berries."

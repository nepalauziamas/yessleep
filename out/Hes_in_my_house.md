 

I’m writing this while feeling choked by the lack of oxygen in my room. I’m having a hard time focusing on writing this. I don’t know how to describe it. The air feels thick, and dry. Like when you are in a sauna. It also feels like the walls are resting on my shoulders. Like the walls are built right around my bed. My room is big… Or was big. I mean it is big but it really doesn’t feel like it anymore. Mom should have been home by now. She’s working late. Dad is still not home. My mom and I have been worried the last week. I was pretty sure he had left us. I have a window right behind me. The window is at the end of my bed, and I’m too scared to open the curtains to see if he’s still out there. You guys probably think I’m crazy, but let me explain.

So last week I was “sick”. Said in another way I didn’t want to go to school, so I waited for my mom to come into my room. I waited  in bed for what I think was about 10 minutes before my mom came in. “Sarah what are you doing, you should be getting ready for school!?” She said in a loud tone. “Mom, can I call in sick today? I’m really not feeling good today” I said in my best sick voice I could. Remember I was only pretending there, and I really regret calling in sick that that. My mom's facial expression changed, and she said something in the lines of “Do you think you have a fever?” and I answered that I didn’t know, but I just wasn’t feeling too good. She agreed to let me go home and went to work. Before she left she reminded me that she was working late. (My mom works late quite often, so that she has enough money to provide food for us both.)

After mom left I kind of didn’t know what to do. “I got this far, now what?” I thought. Normally mom wants to check my temperature and all that, but she didn’t that day. She was probably stressed about work, what do I know?

I was feeling kinda hungry, quite starving actually. I’m still not sure why today, I remember eating a LOT of lunch the day before, but I guess I’m still growing. For anyone wondering I’m 14. I guess if you want to know a little description of me is, a 5 feet 3 inches girl, with a quite slim body I'd say so myself. I have freckles, blue eyes, and white hair.

After getting myself some breakfast, I went upstairs to my room. When I went up to my room I got my first red flag. The door was closed. Right then and there I didn’t think much of it and just opened it, and went into my room. I took out my laptop, and placed myself on my bed. I looked at some youtube for some time, and saw a video of someone on omegle. I don’t remember  who made the video to be honest, but I do remember it made me wanna go on omegle myself. So I did. I went on omegle, and I really wish I didn’t. So I went on omegle. I met some people, talked to some people, and saw some old men jerking off, but you can’t escape that when you are on omegle.  After some time I met this guy. He looked really skinny. Like unhealthy skinny, with some wrinkly skin hanging from his arms. Like if you think of the skin old ladies have hanging from their arms. He was also really pale. Like so white he could blend in with a white wall. He looked young.

He looked like he was my age. The way he looked should have been my cue to skip him, but I’m not the type to judge people by their appearance, so I said hi. He didn’t answer, he just stared at me.

His room was really dark. The only thing lighting up his face was his screen. Everything else was completely dark. I said hi again, and asked if he could hear me. He said yes after some time. I tried to keep it normal, and asked if he wanted to borrow a lamp(because his room was so dark).  He said “Maybe” in a very hoarse voice. An awkward silence came, but after some time he broke the silence. He said maybe you can come with one, and winked at me. I tried to laugh it off but thought it was really creepy.

I answered “Aha maybe”. I was pretty sure he just was one of the pedos. He answered me with “Or maybe I can just come to you.”. I asked him how old he was, because I was really curious. He told me to guess, and I said  “16?”. He just answered with a cold “No”. Then I said “Older or younger?”, and he said “older”. “Really? You look like you’re my age” I said. “Age?” He said(again with the cold hoarse voice” His voice made me feel sick. His voice made my head pound. The warm feeling of when you're tired but you still wanna do something. The feeling you have in your head when you have been in your bed for 2 days straight.

After talking some time with him, I began getting the headache of my life. I said that I was going to hop off, but he said that I wasn’t allowed to. I asked him “allowed?”. He said yeah, either you keep talking to me here or I'll come up and talk with you”. I was pretty sure he just was one of the trolls on the website so I told him to do it, and then I pressed the end button.

After pressing end the feeling of my head pounding and the headache lifted.

I remember thinking, “Hey, it's my day off, let me use it productively” and then I went to sleep.

I woke up, feeling like I was drowning. The feeling of a thick version of water drowning me, leaving me just enough air to live. But that air left me so fast. It was like getting punched in the stomach, when I saw that my door was closed…. Again… I turned on the flashlight on my phone and looked around in my room. Nothing seemed wrong. Everything seemed fine, but the feeling of everything being wrong didn’t leave. I wanted to step out of my bed and search the house, but I was too scared. I was too scared to even move. I didn’t move a muscle, I just sat there lighting up the door with my flashlight. I began having a feeling of someone looking at me. A feeling of someone, or something breathing down my neck. After what felt like a year, I finally pulled myself together and turned off the flashlight and laid down in my bed to sleep some more, but the feeling still wouldn’t leave. After a lot of time just looking up at my roof trying to sleep.

A loud thud made me jump up in a sitting, and then I saw it. I saw a person running out of my room leaving the door open. I wasn’t sure if I was going insane or what was happening. Was it really him, I was questioning myself. I took a knife I had laying on my table and I went out of my room slowly. I was trying to follow him, not confront him. So I just tried to follow him, but then I saw him move our bookshelf, and go into a room behind it. I have been living in this house for 5 years and I have never even known that that room was there. I didn’t wanna follow him in. I was scared. I am still scared. I went up to my room again, and called 911, and now I am typing this while waiting for them to come. I’ll update when the police come and catch him.

EDIT: SHIT SHIT SHIT IM HEARING STEPS COMING RUNNING, AND I JUST LOCKED MY DOOR, I AM TYPING THIS WHILE SHAKING AND FEELING LIKE MY ROOM IS GETTING SMALLER BY THE SECOND. THE FEELING OF DROWNING AND THE HEADACHE IS COMING BACK. I AM SO SCARED. MY FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN IS KILLING ME RIGHT NOW AND I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO. He is still banging on the door. The police should be here in 5 minutes, I really hope he doesn’t kick the door in…

Edit 2:  The banging stopped, and I can hear the sirens. ARGH FUCK THE WINDOW JUST BROKE, SHIT HE’S IN HERE AND HE HAS A GUN HELP ME PLEASE

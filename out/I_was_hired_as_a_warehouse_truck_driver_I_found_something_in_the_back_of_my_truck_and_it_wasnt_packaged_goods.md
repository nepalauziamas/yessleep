It was a quiet Sunday evening when I got the call. I was just getting ready for bed when I heard the familiar ringtone blaring from my phone. It was from a No Caller ID.

I sat there at the edge of the bed, phone to my ear. "Hello?"

There was no reply. Just silence. I could faintly hear background noises at the other end of the line, though. After a long moment, a cool, businesslike voice piped up. "Good evening. Am I speaking to Alfred Lindgren?"

"Yes, you are," I answered. "Who's this?"

"I'm calling from RSA Commerce. Are you still interested in the Truck Driver role?"

Those words chased the sleep out of my eyes. I quickly sat up straight. "Yeah. Yeah, I'm still interested," I said, trying to calm the urgent excitement in my voice.

The 2008 Recession was rough on everyone. Life was beating the shit out of me like I stole something. I had lost my car mechanic job and I was behind on my rent. Finding a job opportunity was like finding water in the desert.

"We would like to invite you for an interview. Would you be free tomorrow morning?" the man over the phone asked. His voice was soft and silky smooth. So smooth it was almost unnerving. He sounded like one of those ASMR YouTubers. "8:30 AM, to be exact."

"I'll be there." 

The interview was done over the phone. I sat at my dining room table, phone to my ear.

They asked all the questions I expected.

*Why do you think you're a good fit for this company?*

*Tell us about a time when you displayed initiative in your job*

*Why do you want to work for us?*

When the interview ended, the man handed me the job there and then. "When can I expect to start?" I asked.

"Next Monday," he answered. "Be here at 6:30 am sharp."

The warehouse was a 45-minute drive from my apartment. Johnny Cash sang his heart out on the car radio as I sped through the highway on a foggy morning. The long road ran through the woods and I drove past miles and miles of tall birch trees that stretched up to the sky. All around me, there was nothing but forest.

The RSA Commerce warehouse was an old, empty building complex, tucked away in the middle of nowhere. It looked abandoned. I pulled up to the car park outside it.

As I stepped out of my car, I couldn't help but notice the high level of security. There were lots of security guards roaming around the facility, patrolling the area. That should have sent the alarm bells ringing. But the man who interviewed me had explained that my job would involve delivering confidential, high-value goods. It made sense that they'd go balls-out on the security.

The top of the market pay was enough to stop me questioning.

"It'll only be a 3-week contract," the man on the phone had informed me. "Our main driver is disposed at the moment. We just need a contractor to temporarily fill his place, until we can find a permanent replacement in-house."

The first day went as you'd expect. Me and my line manager had a short huddle meeting. Then, I was assigned my truck.

I leaned against the hood of my car, smoking a cigarette while I waited for the box truck to be loaded. The job of loading trucks was only assigned to a select few. Once the truck was loaded, my supervisor moved it onto the road for me. He hopped out and handed me the keys, before reminding me of his warnings, tattooing the words into my memory. "Your job is simply to drive to the destination and drive back here. Nothing more, nothing less," he cleared his throat and spat onto the ground. "Do not, at any point, attempt to open the back of the truck. What's in there is confidential. It'll be a 3-hour drive. Arrive before 10:30 am or on the dot. Not a second later."

"While the workers in the warehouse unload the back of the truck, stay in your seat and wait. Do not try to step out of the truck and help. Just stay in your seat and wait for the green light to leave."

I was on the road by 7 am. The first job was a 200-mile drive to Detroit. I sipped some black coffee and listened to an *80s Greatest Hits* playlist as I made my way from Muskegon. The traffic wasn't too bad, so it was a smooth drive. When I arrived at the drop-off point, the workers signalled for me to reverse into a dimly-lit warehouse. Just as I was instructed, I waited in the driver's seat as they unloaded the truck before giving me the green light to go. Then I made my way back to the RSA Commerce depot.

The only time I stopped was to fuel up or take a toilet break.

My shift ended around 2 pm that day.

The schedule remained the same on most days, with the odd graveyard shift here and there. Whenever I finished a drop-off, I'd go straight home. There was never more than one drop-off per day. I was making easy money and the hours weren't too bad.

Everything was going well until I started hearing thuds from the back of my truck one night.

I still remember that night like it was yesterday. It was two weeks into the job when my line manager called me to work my third graveyard shift. I was running late on my way to Flint, driving down a dark, quiet road when I started hearing thuds from the back of the truck. First, they were light, gentle thuds. Then they gradually got louder, more frantic, more desperate.

Then I heard the faint, muffled sound of someone crying. The sudden realization washed over me, sending shivers up my spine. There was someone in the back of the truck.

I felt my stomach twisting into knots. I pulled up to the breakdown lane and slowed the truck to a stop. Apart from the bright truck headlights, the road ahead was pitch black and empty.

The biting cold wind rushed against me as I stepped out of the truck, my heart hammering in my chest. I made my way to the back and pulled up the two latches on the rear door and tugged the door open.

I opened the door and was immediately assaulted by the pungent smell of urine. It made me gag. As soon as the door started opening, I could hear a faint beeping noise. Probably a sensor.

I raised my flashlight as I edged into the darkness. In the back of that truck, I found a huddle of people tied up on the floor, their wrists and ankles bound in ropes. Most of them seemed to be knocked out, but one of them, a woman, was awake. The image of her gaunt, pale face is forever etched into my memory. Her eyes widened when they met mine. "Please. Whatever you do, just let my little girl go," she whispered through her tears. "She's only twelve. Please."

I froze, paralyzed in fear as the realization sank into my heart.

I had unknowingly taken part in a human trafficking ring.

As luck would have it, a passing police car happened to pull up in the breakdown lane a couple minutes after my discovery.

It was a freezing cold night, and the officers came to offer me a ride, adamant to not let me stay out there waiting for breakdown repair all night. The officers were friendly and jovial until they heard the crying from the back of the truck.

It didn't look good for me.

The police questioned me for a long time, asking the same questions over and over again.

I told them the truth about what happened.

That I was hired as a truck driver by a company called RSA Commerce. That I was assigned a 3-week contract and was only informed that I would be delivering confidential, high-value goods. I had no knowledge of any human trafficking operation whatsoever.

But there was no official paperwork to confirm that I was ever employed by a company called RSA Commerce. As a matter of fact, there was no evidence that such a company ever existed. Not on the job board I applied through, and not anywhere else on the Internet. RSA Commerce was a dummy corporation.

All of my wages were paid by cash, so there were no wire transfers that the police could trace back to.

The number I used to contact my employer didn't exist anymore.

The truck I drove had a fake number plate and had been reported stolen. Its owner was 600 miles away in Iowa.

The policemen had raided the RSA Commerce warehouse in the early hours of the following morning. There was no trace of anyone there. Not a single soul.

There was no one at the drop-off points either. It was almost as if they had all disappeared, vanished into thin air like ghosts.

There was no evidence that I had been framed. There was, however, plenty of evidence that I was driving a stolen truck with a bunch of kidnapped people in the back.

I was just a mule that they used to do their dirty work. And without anyone else to blame, the police pinned it on me. The evidence wasn't concrete, but it was better for *someone* to be brought to justice, than no one. They needed someone to hang, someone to burn at the stake.

My life fell apart from that point onwards. I finished serving my 5-year sentence for Kidnapping back in 2013.

But the fact that I was falsely accused of a crime is not what haunts me today. What haunts me is the one question that lingers in the back of my mind.

On that cold night, the police found twelve women and children who were lucky to survive.

How many more were not as lucky? How many more people did I deliver to their deaths in the back of that truck?

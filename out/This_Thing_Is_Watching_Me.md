  

I’ve just witnessed something so terrible that I’m shaking now trying to type this. 

&#x200B;

I live in a gated apartment complex that is well lit at night. Everything is peaceful and usually nothing out of the ordinary happens. Disturbances are rare. At least, regular disturbances. There is one odd thing I noticed a week or so ago. There are lamps on the sides of the building that light up during twilight and stay light through the night. Though there is this one that is faulty. 

&#x200B;

I wouldn’t know this if I hadn’t seen it dim and then go dark myself while out on my balcony smoking a few nights ago. I’m usually up late in my office, watching videos or working until dawn breaks. I keep the opposite of a “normal” schedule, but it is what I prefer working from home. 

&#x200B;

I usually take a break every hour or so to smoke out on my balcony. When the light went out how I mentioned before, I thought it was odd. Maybe the wiring was bad, or it just died, or it malfunctioned in some other way. Then I kept thinking about how that the end of that row of balconies, which was diagonal across the parking lot from mine, was never lit. In fact, I didn’t know there was ever a light there in the first place. It is the far-left balcony on the second and topmost floor of that section of units. The lights are evenly placed between balconies and were always lit at night and acted as streetlamps for residents.

&#x200B;

I then swore to myself that that light was never on, as I often saw a resident smoking on that same balcony at the same time as me not too long ago. I remember they were wearing black, but I could see their silhouette, leaning on the balcony railing. I also remember seeing the flick of a lighter. I also remember a different time seeing what I assume was the same person, pacing around the balcony. But there was never a light. 

&#x200B;

I thought to myself that I was obviously thinking about this way too much and I was finished with my cigarette anyway. I put it out and went back inside. It wasn’t weird to me then, and I forgot all about the occurrence until tonight. Tonight, is when it happened again. I was out there at maybe 9 P.M. The sun was barely gone. I wasn’t even looking in the direction of the light, but in my peripheral, I began to see something fade. I looked, and the same light was slowly dying. I was left with the same weird feeling. I’m not a superstitious person for the most part, but if I see something weird happen more than once, I sometimes begin to wonder if it is a coincidence or not. 

&#x200B;

I was still staring, taking the last few pulls off my cigarette. I thought I might inform management that one of the lights was going out, or whatever, and they could figure out the issue. If I did, it would have to be tomorrow. I then looked down at my car below me. It is parked under the carport directly below my balcony, the roof being right in front of me at foot level. I remembered I had forgotten to bring in the drinks I left in my trunk but was too lazy to go downstairs and retrieve them. I headed back inside and continued with my night. It wasn’t until my next smoke-break, not a half hour ago, that I saw it. 

&#x200B;

When I emerged from my door, I saw it standing there, on top of the carport in front of me, with its arms at its side but not in a natural way. They hanged down at an unnatural angle not touching its form. It was a humanoid thing, but clearly not human. Completely black in nature and with no face and not moving. It seemed as if it was looking my way, but it had no eyes or features. I felt chilled, physically but also out of pure fear. I knew it was focused on me, and it was maybe 10 feet in front of me. 

&#x200B;

I was paralyzed for some time, and then, every other light lining the units started to dim. I felt imminent fear knowing that darkness would soon collapse around me, and I would be all alone with whatever was in front of me. I heard a hiss as I snapped out of my shock and quickly ran inside, slamming and locking the door. 

&#x200B;

I’m in my office now and will remain here until I see sunlight seeping through my blinds. I don’t know what I saw, but it’s fixated on me. I can feel it. It’s not a person. I don’t know why it just stood there and didn’t pursue me. Maybe it’s just watching. I will try and write an update, but I’m hoping I don’t encounter it again. That being said, I still feel as if there is something else here with me.

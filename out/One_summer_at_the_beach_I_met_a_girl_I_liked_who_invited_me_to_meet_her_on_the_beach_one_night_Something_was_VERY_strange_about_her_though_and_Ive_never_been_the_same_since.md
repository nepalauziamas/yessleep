I met Carly two years ago. I remember how we met, too. It was honestly a bit of a freak occurrence. At the time, me and a friend of mine, Caleb, were spending the summer in his grandparents’ old beach house up in Myrtle Beach. I remember I was standing in line at the movies, wigging out to Caleb, about the new Halloween movie. “I heard it was directed by the dudes who made “SAW”, I remember shouting in his face.

“Yeah, the suck-ass ones”, he said, scoffing. I remember how I was even jumping around like a little kid hopped up on too much candy. “Come on, can’t we just watch the new “Conjuring” movie instead?” I remember looking at him like “please tell me that was just a bad joke”. It was no small secret, I was not a fan of those movies.

“Really dude”, I chided condescendingly. 

“What? What’s wrong with it? It’s based on a true story.” I made a fake “I’m so scared” face. He rolled his eyes and added, “At least it might have some *actual* scares in it, I’ve heard the new “Halloween” is just a gore fest.” 

“As if”, I scoffed. “Come on, how can you beat a classic like ‘Halloween’?” In my excitement, I ended up bumping right into the girl in line behind me. This caused the both of us to end up toppling over onto the ground; me landing, where else, but right on top of her. For a moment, we stared at each other on the ground, facing each other with both of our eyes the size of serving platters.

“Oh, uh”, I stammered, “a-a-are you okay?” She just continued staring back up at me, face chiseled in an expression of pure shock. From behind me, I could hear the sound of a photo snapping. Looking back, I saw Caleb standing there with a shit-eating grin on his face, holding his phone up. Seeing this, I scrambled off of her to my feet. 

He started snickering and I saw the crowd form around us. “What the hell are you doing?!”

“Oh, don’t mind me”, he remarked, his grin still on full-blast. 

I was about to try and rush him to snatch the phone and chuck it half across the street when, from behind me, I heard a soft voice ask, “Was it a good pic?” I snapped my head around to see her on her feet too. She was smirking kinda sheepishly. Instantly, my body tensed up again.

“Oh, uh... I... I, uh”, I stuttered. She started giggling. My tongue froze again. *”Come on, dingus, you’re blowing it here! Get your shit together!”* “Pete”, I finally blurted.

“Huh”, she asked, “Come again?”

“Oh, uh, My name; Pete.” I chuckled nervously, feeling less than two seconds from a heart attack, and shakily held my hand out to her. 

She stared at me for a moment, seemingly confused. Her eyes seemed to lock directly onto mine. In a way, I could feel them boring though me. For a moment, I thought I could see something else in those eyes; something like maybe worry or... *fear*...

“Yo Pete, you comin’?” I looked behind me to see that the line was moving. Caleb was third in line now to the ticket booth. I turned again back to her, her face still fixed in that worried looking expression. 

I signaled to him that I’d be right there. He rolled his eyes and mouthed for me to “hurry the hell up” (I was the one with the money for tickets). Suddenly, she started blinking rapidly, broken from her stupor. “Huh”, she asked, “What happened?”

“Oh, uh, nothing. I just told you my name was Pete and you just sorta zoned out there. Everything okay?”

She smiled again and nodded her head. “Yeah, sorry”, she said, chuckling, “Sometimes I just get lost in myself, you know? I’m Carly, by the way.” 

“Ahh. Well, you wanna join me and my buddy? We’re gonna see the new ‘Halloween’!”

“Oh, uh... sure, why not?” She smiled and I bit my lip. I remember getting to the ticket booth and Caleb looking at me confused before then grinning, knowing I’d just scored a date with my little embarrassment. 

The movie was enjoyable enough, but of course, I was barely even concentrated on it. See, I’m one of those people that will actually talk during a movie, even in theaters (despite almost getting into a fistfight with some of the other patrons on certain occasions because of this). Caleb would usually try to ignore me, but not her. 

Actually, turns out, Carly was the same way. So we spent the entire time gawking, laughing, and chatting back and forth about the movie. Though, like I said, I barely was focused on the screen. I couldn’t take my eyes off of her for more than thirty seconds without finding gaze locked right back on her. I mean, she was *BEAUTIFUL*, sure; drop-dead fuckin’ gorgeous, in fact. But it wasn’t just that. It was something else about her; something more, something... I don’t know... *hypnotic* in a way.

Still, bottom line; that night went from a great night to fuckin’ amazing, all because I made a fool of myself. Towards the end of the movie, despite what I just said, somehow I didn’t notice she’d laid her head on my shoulder and fallen asleep. When I woke her up, she jolted awake, frightened. “Huh, what happened”, she exclaimed, throwing her head left and right.

“Whoa, sorry, didn’t mean to scare you. the movie’s over, though.” She began to relax a little. I could tell she was still tense about something. “Hey, is everything okay?”

“Oh, uh... yeah, what time is it, though?” 

I looked at my phone, “Uh, 12:30.” Her eyes bugged out again. “Why, what’s wrong?”

“Oh, shit, my folks are gonna kill me! I was supposed to be home an hour ago!” She started ruffling her hands frantically through her hair. 

“Hey, it’s okay. If you like, I can give you a—“

“No”, she blurted, startling me. “I-I mean, that’s not necessary, hehe.”

“It’s really no trouble”, I said, trying to be reassuring — and pretty obviously failing. 

She shook her head and said, “No really, it’s fine, it’s better if I just go ahead and go. I don’t live that far away anyway. Plus I stand a better chance of sneaking by unnoticed if I don’t have another person announcing my presence, you know?”

“Oh, yeah...”, I conceded, “Well, um, I had fun tonight.” She smiled and said “Me too”. As she was turning to leave, I shot out my hand and shouted, “Wait!” 

She spun around. I started digging in my pockets, pulling out my ticket stub and a pen and began scrawling my phone number. “Um, call me sometime. We can maybe hang out again.” She giggled before pocketing my number and leaving.

So, yeah; that’s how all that started. It was only the weekend after that that our second date was booked, this time being to the water park. That was where I learned she actually used to be on her high school swim team, as well as work in summertimes as a lifeguard. I’ll say this much, she could swim *circles* around my ass. 

Turned out, she lived right along the beachfront here in Myrtle Beach. I remember thinking how cool that was. “I’m gonna call you “Ariel” from now on”, I joked. Her face seemed to sink at this. “You know, from ‘The little Mermaid’?”

“Oh, uh, yeah, I know what you meant. Just, I don’t know, I’d really rather not be called that.”

“Oh”, I said, feeling stupid, “sorry.”

She shook her head and grinned again, “Don’t worry about it. Wanna get some ice cream?” I immediately jumped up with a resounding “Hell yeah!” 

Just like at the movies, that date went awesome, too. We spent the entire day splashing around at the water park like little kids. Soon, 6:00 rolled around and it started to get dark. That’s when Carly insisted that she leave. “Are you sure? I mean, the park’s open for another couple hours.”

“Yeah, I think it’s better I go ahead and head back, though.” She winked and added, smiling, “Be nice to avoid another incident like last time, right?”

“Oh, yeah”, I said, “good point.” I sighed, disappointed (I was really hoping to stay until closing, they turn the hot tubs on at 7 until closing). 

She walked up to me, smiling and put her arms around my waist, whispering in my ear, “I had fun with you though, handsome.” Following this, she planted a kiss on my cheek that caused my heart to stop. 

She then turned and left, leaving me standing there, jaw slack. That night, I was up tossing and turning. I couldn’t help it; I couldn’t stop thinking about her. 

I kept having this dream where, for some reason, She’s standing in front of the ocean, facing me, smiling warmly. 

***

She curls her finger, beckoning me forward. I start towards her; compelled by some force, like I’m being pulled by a leash towards her. 

She backs slowly into the ocean behind her. My own stride quickens. I reach out to her. “Wait”, I cry. 

She continues to be swallowed by the tide. I begin running for her, determined to reach her before she’s gone. Just before the ocean swallows her, I leap forward, hurling myself headfirst like a spear into the water. Instantly, everything around me becomes black. I’m heading downwards, face first into a black, boundless, fathomless abyss. 

I hear nothing. My ears feel like they’ve been stuffed with cotton. My arms and legs feel like feathers on my body. Despite this, my lungs don’t burn. In fact, I don’t feel my lungs anymore.

Instead, I feel a sort of resonance around me. A sort of beating, like from a giant drum, pounding all around me. It gets more and more intense and I begin to feel sharp pains shooting across the sides of my neck. From below, I see thousands of human looking figures swimming up from the abyss below. 

They begin circling around me. My vision becomes blurry, rounded in a way. I look at my hands to see that there’s now skin in between each finger, forming webs in between them. I’m shocked; horrified, yet I’m unable to scream. The people close in around me. I can see them clearly now. They’re tall, green and scaly, with palpitating gills on their necks and webbed hands. 

Each and every one of them look the same, like the gill man from “The Creature from the Black Lagoon”. One of them; a female, judging from the appearance (or at least the aquatic resemblance) of breasts. I just float, seemingly suspended in place, defying gravity in the dark, murky depths of the ocean. 

The fish creature’s eyes lock onto mine. I’m once again spellbound. She puts her webbed hands around my face, puckers her scaly lips and—

***

“PETE!” I was instantly pulled out of the dream. I was standing outside on the back deck of the condo we were in in my boxers. *”Huh? How in the hell did I get here?”*

“Pete, bro, what the heck is going on with you”, he asked, sounding more just shocked at the bizarreness of it. “First, you toss around in the bed, muttering to yourself like a crazy person, now I find you out here damn near in the buff? Bro, you been smokin’?”

For a moment, I just stood there. I didn’t know how to begin making any kind of excuse. To even do *that*, I’d have had to understood *somewhat* what the hell was going on. But I didn’t.

All I knew at the moment was that, one moment, I’m sleeping, dreaming about chasing a pretty girl into the ocean. The next, I’m dreaming of being surrounded by fish people and becoming one myself. And now, there I was, out in the open, in my fuckin’ skivvies. Needless to say, I was *FAR* beyond confused.

“Uh... uh”, I stuttered, “No.” He continued looking at me, bewildered. “I mean... not much, hehe.” 

Just to clarify, I don’t smoke, drink, or do anything like that. Then again, I don’t *typically* sleepwalk either (or dream of fish people for that matter). *”So then, what the hell WAS going on?”*

In the end, I just copped to the “sleepwalking” alibi, which I could tell he had a hard time buying. Despite this, probably because it was 3:30 in the morning, he just shook his head, said “screw it”, and went back to bed. “Just keep it down next time, will ya?”

“Uh... y-yeah. Sorry to wake you.” *”But what the hell happened, how did I get here?”* Then another question popped into my head; How much farther would I have gone if Caleb hadn’t woke me up? 

I started thinking about the dream again. Standing at the ocean, facing Carly. Was *that* where I was going, to the ocean? Why? 

Now, obviously, the simplest explanation to all that was that I was a love struck dumbass and I guess my subconscious was trying to act out my latest wet dream. I mean, this WAS brought on (or likely was, anyway) by Carly kissing me on the cheek. *”Yeah, that’s it. That’s all it is. I’m just having a weird dream about a girl and you started sleepwalking.”*

With that, I decided to go back to bed; though going back to *sleep* was nigh impossible. Instead, I spent the remainder of that night watching Netflix on my phone. About 6:00 or so, with the sun just starting to peak out above the horizon, I get a call from Carly. 

“Hello”, I answered, still pretty groggy (I WAS still tired, even if I couldn’t actually sleep). 

“Hey there, listen, you doing anything big tonight?”

“No, not really, why?”

“You wanna meet up at the beach later on tonight?”

“Sure, uh, what time?”

“About 6-ish, when the sun starts going down.” 

“You’re on.”

I heard her giggle on the other end before saying, “Awesome, see you there, handsome.” She hung up after that. After that, I payed back, smiling, watching the sunrise through the window. *”Petey, Ol’ boy, you’ve done it again.”* 

All that day, I felt free as the seagulls that were flocking on the beach, scrounging for breadcrumbs. Nothing was gonna ruin my day. Caleb noticed this, too. “What’s got you so hyped, huh?” 

I just grinned. “Let me guess, it’s that one girl, ain’t it?”

“Maybe”, I replied, not at all subtly. “Why?”

“Well, I had to figure it was either that, or you’re still trippin’ ass on whatever it was you were on last night.” That made me pause. Up to then, I’d actually forgotten about that little incident. “Speaking of which, am I gonna get any kind of story on what the fuck was goin’ on there?”

“Oh, that”, I replied, chuckling embarrassingly, “I don’t know, I guess I was just sleepwalking.” 

“Sleepwalking, huh?” He scoffed and said “Well, they do say there’s a first time for everything. But I’m still wondering what was makin’ you wig out the way you were.”

“What do you mean?”

“I mean you was floppin’ around worse than a live fish on grill. You were also whispering something in your sleep. Something about “wait for me” or something, I don’t know.”

Now I was curious. See, like I’d been saying, I *wasn’t* a sleepwalker. The same would apply to *talking* in my sleep as well. At the same time, it’s not like I could call bullshit either. I mean, I *was* standing out in my underwear after apparently sleepwalking. That, plus the utterly weird ass dream making my sleep pretty restless, and it all seemed to add up to what Caleb was saying. 

What *wasn’t* adding up was why. Why did that happen? Why, after all my life of never having any problems with sleeping (being known to sleep through most of the noise of the city where I live), am I now having incidents like what happened the previous night? I thought again back to the waterpark, *“I had fun with you, handsome...”*

*”Carly”*, I wondered, *”Is she **really** the reason why?”* Yes, I know that sounded cheesy enough to make every Hallmark channel director blush (Hell, we’d only *just met*), but what other explanation was there? Though, something else, far off in the back of my head, was telling me that there was another aspect of this. That this may not just be some “Love at first sight, destined to be together forever” type of deal here.

*”But then, what is it exactly?”* I decided then that I’d ask Carly when I saw her that evening. *How* that’d help, I wasn’t sure. But the way I figured, it’s the only way I was gonna get SOME kind of answer. 

So the day passed with me and Caleb just screwing around at the boardwalk. I had fun, of course, but at the same time, I just couldn’t help but think about the ocean; about Carly. I couldn’t really explain it, but I was itching to go to the beach right then and there. 

No, actually, it was *more* than that. I was being *compelled*, *summoned* to the beach somehow. Not only this, but my entire body felt hot as well. My insides felt like they were cooking inside my skin.

I had to get out of my clothes, they were too hot. My mouth was dry. I needed water. *I needed the ocean!* 

“Yo Pete”, I heard a voice shouting behind me, “The hell are you doing?” I snapped back around to see Caleb standing in line for the ice cream stand, looking confused at me. Looking down, I saw that I was, right there in the open, stripped buck-ass nude. 

I could see a crowd gathering around. I froze up. “Uh... uh”, I stammered. 

“Dude, put your frickin’ clothes back on!” Quick as I could, I scrambled to put my jeans back on before me and Caleb scurried out of the boardwalk and back to the condo. When we made it back, after slamming and locking the door, making sure the cops weren’t on their way, he instantly started pressing me as to what just happened.

“I... I don’t know, I swear to God!”

“Look”, he said, exasperated, “I *need* you to be straight with me, okay? Are you high right now? Are you stashing any drugs around here? What’s gotten into you, cause you’re *really* starting to freak me out a bit here.”

I shook my head, “I’m telling you, I *don’t know!* I’m not high. I... I don’t know what just happened.”

“‘Kay, well can you *at least* tell me what was going through your head when you decided to just up and present yourself for God and the world to see?”

“I don’t know. I felt... hot, like I was in an oven. I felt like I was wanting to get out of my skin. I remember wanting to go to the ocean really badly for some reason, like I was being... I don’t know... *called to it*.” He stood, blinking at me in confusion. “That’s all I remember. I’m serious, though, I’m *not* high!”

He rubbed his eyes. He was just as lost as I was — if not understandably more so. “So let me get this straight, here”, he said, sighing, “You’re feeling “called to the ocean”, and you feel like your skin is too hot, which THEN makes you wander off and strip out in the open, twice now. All of this, and you’re *”not high?”*

My face fell into my hands. Despite that being *exactly* what happened, how could I make him understand that? Hell, how was I supposed to make *myself* understand that? “Fuck, I don’t know, man”, I cried through my palms.

He sighed and said, “Look Bro, we’ve been buds since high school, okay? You know you can tell me shit. I got your back. Just tell me what’s goin’ on.”

“I don’t know”, I exclaimed, “How many times do I have to say it, I *don’t know!* Ever since last night, after Carly left the water park—“

“Aha”, he interrupted, a grin parting the corner of his lip, “So *that’s* what this is all about. Why didn’t you just say that in the beginning?”

“Say what?”

“That little girl’s got you by the balls.” He threw his head back and cackled. I wasn’t amused by this. 

“What’re you talking about?”

“Come on, dude. Ever since you bowled her over at the movies, you’ve been goin’ nuts about her. Now, after seeing her at the water park, all dolled up in a swimsuit, and you’re fuckin’ *whipped!*” He chuckled. 

“Whatever man, screw this”, I said, getting up and stomping towards the door. I felt his hand grab my shoulder, stopping me.

“Whoa, whoa, where the hell do you think you’re going?”

“Out”, I snapped, agitated at his snide remarks. As well as this, I started feeling hot again. Stuffy, and hard to really breathe.

He started rapping his knuckles on my forehead, “Uh, hello? Anyone home? You just forget that the cops are probably looking for you after that little stunt at the boardwalk?”

“Look, I’ll be fine, just move.” I batted his hand away and continued for the door. I could now feel my legs getting lighter and lighter, weaker.

“You plan on telling me *where* you’re sauntering off to?” I glared at him. My vision started to blur a bit, but I could still see him. 

“The beach. There, happy now, *”dad?!”* I opened the door. Outside, the sky was starting to turn a bright, burning orange. The sun was going down. 

*”I have to go to Carly! I have to get to the ocean!”* 

My vision blurred more and more. My head began to spin. I felt so hot. So dry. I was burning up. I had to get to the ocean, quick! 

Before I knew it, I was taking off at full speed. My mind was blank, only one thing occupied my focus: getting to the ocean, seeing her. My legs were weak and my lungs were all but flaccid, but I didn’t care. I was gonna get to the beach, to the ocean.

The world around me started to warp, looking more and more rounded. The closer I got, the hotter I felt; inside and out. I imagined the way the waves would cool me off once I made it. *”It’d feel like being a fish!”*

Soon, I was able to see it, the beachfront. It was mostly empty, being that the sun was half gone now. There, almost silhouetted against the sunset’s burning red beam, Carly stood, facing me. Waiting for me. *Calling* to me. 

When I made it to the shoreline, she smiled. “I’m glad you made it, Pete”, she cooed. I stood, breathless, burning up and feeling weak. The way my body felt, I thought my skin would melt off like butter in a microwave. 

Still smiling, she curled her finger at me, winking. “It’s time, come with me.” I began staggering mindlessly towards her. I saw her take baby steps backwards with every step I took towards her. The water felt cool across my skin as my feet entered; not too hot, not too cold. It was soothing.

The further I waded in, the more my body seemed to cool off. More than that, it seemed to go numb, like it almost wasn’t there any more. This started from my feet, and continued throughout my body the further I entered. She continued stepping backwards, descending further into the tide. 

From behind her, I saw what looked like dorsal fins approaching in my direction. *”What the hell? Are those SHARKS?!”* Despite this, I keep moving forward. I couldn’t stop. 

The fins started circling around me and Carly. Carly finally disappeared and I dove headfirst after her. The ocean was murky, making it impossible to see how deep it was at the bottom. It seemed to go on forever as well. I swam and swam as hard as I could, struggling to continue forcing myself downward.

As I went along, I felt sharp, searing pains shoot throughout my body, starting from my ribs. It felt like someone had taken a serrated knife across my body, flaying me open. When I looked down, though, my eyes widened when I saw three large gashes or slots opened wide across them. 

*”What the?! What’s happening to me?!”* When I went to feel them, my heart almost stopped completely, seeing that there were now large fleshy webs connecting between my fingers. I could feel panic course through me and I began flailing frantically to pull myself back to the surface. 

Eventually, I couldn’t feel my arms or legs anymore. In spite of this, I noticed I wasn’t sinking. Instead, I just floated there, suspended in the middle of the ocean depths. 

All around me, I watched as a bunch of figures started swimming around me. They swam in one large hoard around me. “A school of fish”, essentially; forming a sort of ring around me. The longer I watched, the more I was able to distinguish a few of them individually. That’s when I realized, these were the same fish people from my dream.

All of them were green and scaly, with webbed hands and gills across their ribs and necks. I could see their rounded, marbled eyes examine me as they revolved around me. Suddenly, they stopped. They now floated still like I was, seeming to defy gravity, as one of them floated up from directly below me.

As it swam closer, I could see that it was female, just like my dream; with scaly, slippery breasts and an hourglass shaped body. She also had long, light colored strands that resembled hair (though likely wasn’t hair) that flowed from her head. 

Her mouth parted in what I guess was a smile, exposing many rows of small, ivory inlaid teeth. She took my hands in hers and from around me, I hear the simultaneous sounds that reminded me of what a humpback whale sounds like when doing a mating call.

I could do nothing except float there, my body being too exhausted. Her lips began to move and, just *very* faintly, I could hear her say, in a deep-toned version of Carly’s voice, “Kiss me, my love.” She then worked her webbed hand up to my neck, cupping it, before meeting her lips to mine. 

The moment our lips touched, the whale calling noise from the others increased in pitch. Her lips stayed stuck to mine for almost a full minute, when, from the corner of my eye, I noticed the others begin to disperse and start swimming around frantically, the way bees do when the hive is disturbed. She pulled away and looked behind me, opening her mouth and letting out a heart-stopping shriek.

When I looked behind me to see what the commotion was about, My own jaw dropped. It was Caleb, swimming headfirst straight for me. Relief flowed through me. *”I’m saved! He’ll be able to get me o—”*

My relief was cut off, however, as I watched them begin to swarm around him. He struggled furiously, viciously punching and kicking at his assailants, but it did him no favors. They were all too quick to sink their piranha-like teeth into his flesh and have at him. 

Some of them grabbed at his flailing limbs and began pulling, causing them to start ripping from his body. I could see a cloud of red spread across the murky water. Caleb’s eyes were wide with horror, his face twisted with excruciating pain as they continued to maul him. 

I finally managed to break from my earlier state of entropy and I darted through the water to try and get him away from them. I was stopped, however, when the fish woman tightly grasped my ankle. She pulled me back to her, embraced me, and said, “Stay with me, handsome. We’ll never die, we’ll always be together, down here.” 

She moved in to kiss me once again when I shoved her away. For a second, she was still, her rounded eyes somehow opened wider in shock, before she let out another shriek and darting through the water towards me. With quicker reflexes than I ever thought possible, I dodged her just as she would’ve seized me. 

I then was able to grab her and sink my own teeth, now serrated like hers and the others, into her neck. She let out a series of sharp screams that echoed throughout the abyss around us as she squirmed against me. With a single jerk of my head, I tore a chunk from her scaly neck the size of my palm.

Her body almost immediately relaxed and I let go of her. She fell slowly to the dark, boundless depths below. When I looked up, I saw the others staring back at me, horrified and disgusted. Having all but devoured Caleb by that point, I could tell that I was now their second course after what I’d just done.

Thinking quickly, I took off, shooting straight up through the water. I didn’t dare chance a look behind me. I didn’t need to; their enraged shrieks signaling to me that they were gaining on me, and fast. I focused solely on the surface of the ocean. Soon, I was able to see it, the surface of the ocean. 

With one final push, I did it; I broke the surface. From there, I quickly scrambled back to the shore before collapsing; exhausted once again. It was at least a good ten or fifteen minutes that I just laid there, completely spent both physically and mentally. 

It was sort of a slow digression, the thoughts and emotions I felt next. Starting with relief. I had made it out! Not only that, but my body looked normal again, looking like regular human flesh rather than a fish like it was earlier. Then came complete confusion. *”What was that?! What the FUCK just happened there?! What was happening to me?!”* 

This was then replaced by grief over Caleb. My friend, who’d always had my back since high school, who tried to save me from *WHATEVER* the fuck *that* was in the ocean, now fish food. Finally, this was capped off with a sense of raw terror. 

*”They’re after me now, aren’t they?”* I knew they wanted to kill me for what I did down there. I had seemingly betrayed them and murdered one of them. For that, they won’t forgive me. 

I was able to stumble my way back to the condo, where I immediately began packing everything of mine I could find. I’d likely forgotten a few things, looking back, but I couldn’t have cared less. I just wanted to get the hell outta dodge the first chance I could. By sunrise, I was on the highway, heading out of Myrtle Beach. 

I haven’t gone back since then, and I never want to. They’re still there, I just know it. Somewhere, deep beneath the ocean, far farther down than most will ever see, they’re still there; waiting, longing for me to return so they can finish me. And they’ll never stop, for they don’t die like the rest of us. Now, though, I suppose, neither do I. 

I still don’t know exactly how my body became the way it is. But I’m willing to bet it had something to do with Carly. How and/or why, though, I don’t think I’ll ever be able to tell you. All I CAN say is, I’m scared.

I don’t want to go back, but it’s getting harder and harder to resist. My body feels so hot all the time and I can’t physically exert myself much at all anymore without feeling breathless and weak. For the past two years now, I’ve shut myself away in my house, living as a hermit essentially.

I’ve managed to get by so far by making money working from home on my computer, along with living off of delivery pizza and take-out. But I’m worried I won’t last much longer. Even as I write this, my body feels so hot and I grow weak, barely able to even stay conscious enough to type. 

It’s the ocean, I can feel it. It’s calling me to it, and I don’t wanna go.

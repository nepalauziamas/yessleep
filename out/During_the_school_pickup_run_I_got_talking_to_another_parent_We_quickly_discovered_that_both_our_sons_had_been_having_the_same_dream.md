"It's a bit of a boring wait, isn't it?", the voice next to me said.

"Hmm", I half-heartedly responded as I turned to face the lady standing to my right.

"Waiting for the bell to ring. I think I look forward to it just as much as the kids."

"Not me. I don't mind if it rings a few minutes late." I said with a smile.

The lady gave a light chuckle before taking a step closer towards me.

"I think my son would agree with you there", she said, trying to continue the conversation, "He seems to like Mrs. Wagen's company more than his own mothers".

"She seems to have that effect on the students, doesn't she?", I responded, "My son loves her too".

"Oh, is your boy in her class as well?".

"Yeah, and Jimmy has never loved school more".

"She is definitely my James's favourite teacher too", she said as she nodded, "I think she could teach us a thing or two about how to really connect with ten year old boys".

"She has a knack with them, that's for sure. And Jimmy's grades have never been better too.", I gloatingly said, without trying to make it too obvious.

"So has James's. I think he might be top of the class." she responded, boasting even more than I just had."

"Well, from what I've heard, Jimmy is actually at the top."

"They both must be tied for number one in the class then.", she said with a smile that seemed to hide her truer, more annoyed emotion.

"Jimmy has recently shown great interest in chemistry and has been experimenting with chemicals.", I said, further trying to boast about my son.

"So has James. He loves it."

"What about sports? Jimmy is a very fast runner".

"So is James. He can even out run his dad".

It appeared that both my child and hers were on a similar level, but that didn't stop me from backing down.

"Well, Jimmy has just started to show great talent in art. He is great at drawing absence of lights.", I said, hoping to finally out-do this other woman's son.

"By 'absence of light', you mean a shadow?", she responded.

"Yeah, that's right. He likes to draw what he sees in his dream. And he often sees a shadow when he sleeps".

The woman's face scrunched up in a look of confusion. 

"The shadow that follows him around in his dream. The Sleep Shadow?", she asked worriedly.

"Yeah. How do you know about the Sleep Shadow"?, I asked, confused as to how she knew exactly what my son called the things from his dreams.

"James sees it too. He tells me about the dark shadow that is constantly following behind him in his dreams. He says it is like it is stuck onto his back. He shows me drawings of it every once in a while."

I stood there for a moment, mostly puzzled but also a bit worried as to how another child was dreaming of the same thing as my son.

"Does he see the Sleep Shadow every night?", I asked.

She pondered the question for a moment before answering.

"No, not every night. Maybe a few times a week."

"Every second night?", I asked, already anticipating the answer.

She let this question roll around inside her head for a moment, calculating exactly when her son did see the Sleep Shadow.

"You know what? Now you mention it, yeah he does see it every second night. He will dream of it one night and then not the next. Usually on the days where he doesn't act out".

"Doesn't act out?", I inquired, but I already knew exactly what she meant.

"James seems to have one good day and then one bad one. I know I was gloating before about how perfect he is, but I may have stretched the truth a little bit.", she answered as she looked down towards the floor.

"Don't worry, I embellished Jimmy's accomplishments too. He also has a cycle of one day where he is perfectly behaved and then another where he is rude, doesn't listen and is a little physically aggressive.", I told the other mum.

"What do you mean he is 'physically aggressive?", she asked me in a manner that seemed like she already knew the answer.

"Mostly he is fine, but he gets very angry and will start to punch and kick if you-"

"If you look at what he is drawing.", she said, finishing my sentence.

I nodded. 

"He is more than happy to show me his drawings of the shadow, but he draws something else too. Something he doesn't want me to see.", I said.

"Have you managed to see what else Jimmy has been drawing?", she asked me.

I shook my head.

"Have you?", I asked her.

Her head also shook. 

**Ring ring ring**

The school bell rang out across the school yard, interrupting our conversation. 

A second or two later, a large crowd of kids began to pour out of the main school building. The stampede of adolescents had brought an end to my talk with this other lady. 

She waved at me, a distinct look of fear in her eyes. I saw her walk back to her car and wait for her son to arrive.

I did the same. I sat back in the car and waited for my own son. I now felt almost nervous to see him though.

I looked out across the schoolyard and managed to get a glimpse of my son coming out of the school building. I watched on as, instead of walking towards the car, he walked to the side of the building.

I lost some of my vision of him, but could still see enough of him to see that happened next.

Jimmy stood incredibly still and outstretched both of his arms. A look of pain and fear came over his face and then I saw something dark emerge from behind his head. 

A dark shadow began to pour out of his head and float in the air next to him. Then more of the shadow came from within my son. It came out of his back, his arms and his legs and then floated beside him, like a dark oil floating in water.

The shadow was the exact same shape and height as my son, and had peeled off of him as an exact replica of his appearance. 

Then, the shadow swirled and bubbled in the air. I first saw eyes appear from within it. Then a nose and then a mouth. Skin began to form across it entirely. It was becoming an exact clone of my son.

Standing beside Jimmy was an identical copy of him, made from the dark shadow. It was even dressed in school uniform and had a backpack on.

Both versions of my son then started to walk across the schoolyard and towards the pick-up area. I saw Jimmy, the real one, start to walk over towards the other ladies car. He hopped in.

The shadowy version of Jimmy, however, walked directly over to my car. I watched on in terror and he pulled on the door handle, opened the door and climbed up into the back seat.

"Hello Mum.", the thing said with a smile.

Even in the rear-vision mirror, I could see a darkness in his eyes. The same darkness that I saw every second day.

"I drew you a picture.", it told me as it handed me a piece of paper, "I think its time to show you what it is I've been drawing".

My hand was shaking as it reached out and grabbed the picture. I had never been more scared of anything before in my life. Something was sitting in my back seat and handing me this picture. Something that wasn't my son.

I looked down at what was drawn on the piece of paper, and gasped as I did.

The entire top half of the page was covered in black scribble, like a dark shadow looming over the rest of the page. Underneath the black were six stick figures. Two were standing upright, while the other four were laying on the ground.

The two standing figures were labelled 'Jimmy' and 'James'. Two of the laying stick figures were labelled 'Dad', and the other two were titled 'Mum'.

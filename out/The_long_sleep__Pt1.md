As a kid I was always paranoid about the world ending, about aliens coming to earth, about nuclear warheads and a lot of other apocalyptic events. The one that I was most afraid of was nuclear warheads, but now I want to send out this message and share my story about what happened to me.

As I said I was always scared of those things, but as a kid I imagined every night that I would be sleeping and a nuke would cause world destruction, but as I grew older I didn't think about it, I started to concentrate on other things like school and girls. My life was like any other teen out there. I went to parties, I hooked up with girls in the bathroom, I wasted my time on video games, etc. At the age of 16 I started getting those thoughts again cause there was a lot of theories about WWIII starting, so I knew what to do and I had an idea. There was this commercial for this bed on tv every night, It was called the "Bed of safety". So what is was is a bed that detects earthquakes and when it detects a strong earthquake it lowers the mattress to the bottom of the metal covered bed and closes the top like a vault. I just had some money so I decided to buy it. It came the next day me and my dad got to work and installed it. It was a pretty big bed so it took up most of my room but it was fine. When I lied on the bed I felt so safe and so comforted cause I knew if anything happens I'm well protected.

My life at the time wasn't anything special, until one night that changed my life forever. I was lying in bed while listening to my rock music playlist ( I was into rock and metal at that time ) and just didn't have a worry in my mind. Mom was cooking , dad as always was watching the news my sister was at a party that night. The house we were in was a two story house in which we enjoyed our time. My family was very close, we would argue of course like any family but there was just something really special about it. Every Friday we have a "Movie night", I mean the name explains it, we all sit down on the couch and just watch some scary movies. My mom and sister just fell asleep, my mom's head on my sister's shoulder and my sister's head relaxed on a pillow. My dad and I we're almost asleep cause the movie just got boring, I stared to close my eyes cause I was so tired, but I got interrupted by those horrible government messages on the tv, the sounds were horrifying. It kept repeating the same message over and over again in a robotic voice: " \*beep\* beep\* This is an automated government message , please get to your nearest underground bunker, this is NOT a drill."

Me and my dad thought it was some sort of prank, cause we did have neighbours that would probably pull this kind of prank off. When we started seeing people run out of their homes to their cars and speeding of we knew it was serious. We woke up my mom and sister I quickly explained what was happening everybody was panicking. The tv started saying : "The nearest government bunker in your location is 3km away in (REDACTED), government officials will be waiting at the front of the bunker." We listened carefully and wrote the address down. We packed some food and some clothes and got in our car. We had an automated garage that took a while to open so my dad just pushed the button waited so the garage can just open a little more than the cars height and he just sped off. We were terrified. We were already seeing people fighting over food in the markets, people shooting at others, people crashing into each other, it was everything I have imagined that was going to happen in this kind of event. It was like watching a movie but your the main character. We got to a certain point when we saw that in was a big line of cars in front of us. My sister started crying, I started panicking, my mom was just quiet, and my dad was just holding his head in his hands like he was saying he gives up. I got out of the car to see how long the line was, but as I was getting out nobody noticed that I opened the door and just got out, my family were just out of it. All of a sudden the cars started moving forward, I got back into the car and my dad started driving. We finally got to the entrance of the bunker ( It was a huge vault in a hill and the metal of the vault looked really really secure ) and felt relieved, but one army looking dude at the entrance started looking trough our stuff, we weren't really suprised cause they can't let anybody in with a gun right so it made sense to us. The army guy goes up to our window and says : "Sir, ma'am and the girl can proceed the boy stays with us". My heart sank when I heard those words. I knew I was going to die to whatever was coming, but I stayed strong for my family and said : "It's okay they probably found my laptop, it's nothing don't worry" , I just wanted to comfort them so they don't worry, but I knew I wasn't going in, for what reason? Well the army guy said in a soft forgiving voice : "Listen son I know this is going to be hard to hear but we can't let you in" , So I asked him why. He said : " We have no more space left, I already let some extra people trough, but if I let any more in the people inside wouldn't even have a year amount of oxygen." I started begging for him to let me in but he just kept shaking his head and saying : "I'm sorry son, but it has to be this way." I started balling my eyes, but my fight or flight senses kicked in when I saw a orange ball of fire coming from the sky right towards the earth. I could barley make out what it was, I just saw that it was a metal object so I just started running as fast as I could to my house cause I knew if I want a chance in surviving I need to get in my "Bed of safety". There was a keypad on the back of the bed so you can manually lock it, in the bed on the metal wall there was a huge storage compartment that held bottles full of water and food that could last me 3 years. So i typed in the code \*beep\* \*beep\* \*beep\* and right as I was putting my finger on the last digit I just looked around the house and out the window and knew I was never going to see this again. \*beep\* The bed started making mechanical noises and I got in, the mattress started going down and the top of the bed started just closing. I had a oxygen filter on the bottom of the bed so I couldn't run out of air. The bed is completely closed now there's no light coming from the outside just the small light in the "Bed of safety". As I was getting comfortable I heard a loud thump noise, I thought that was probably the metal object falling and a second after the noise I started feeling a massive earthquake. It was nothing like I experienced before. I thought this is it, the nuke just landed this is explosion that I'm feeling, all of a sudden I started feeling heat. So I closed my eyes and started praying. After a few minutes I felt nothing, the earthquake stopped, the heat was back to normal and I started to feel fine. I thought is this is, is this heaven? I opened my eyes hoping to see the gate to heaven and angels standing and waiting for me, but when I opened my eyes I just saw grey metal above me and around me, so at least I wasn't dead but now I can't open the bed cause I know if I open it the radiation will kill me. I knew this was my new hell.

I few hours passed, and I didn't hear a single thing, it was dead silence. The only noise that I can hear is myself breathing heavily and my heart pounding from the adrenaline. At that point I started to accept that this was a new chapter in my life, I started thinking about when I get out of here how I'm going to be famous cause I'm the boy that survived a nuke inside a bed, but then the reality hit me, the whole earth might be dead as far as I know. I thought about my family, I started asking myself questions, is my family even alive?, did they even manage to close the doors before the nuke hit?, are my family freaking out that I'm not there?. I just started putting myself into a rabbit hole of questions that I had no answer to. It was getting really boring in there, but I was really glad that my family made it , when I thought about it I knew they closed the door in time so I knew they were safe and that I'm maybe going to see them again soon. The silence was so loud, I know that sounds weird but that's the best way to explain it, I started humming and singing just so I have some sort of sound and entertainment. The sounds coming from my mouth didn't have space to echo so I had to sing very quietly cause it hurt my ears when I sang. Out of nowhere sounds from outside, I thought it was a human at first, so I started shouting and hoping they would hear me : "Hello! Who is that! Please come and help me!". I was so happy that I hear someone, but then I realized it wasn't what I thought it was. It started growling, but not the dog kind of growling, it just didn't sound like an animal. I thought nothing of it until it started climbing the outside house wall. I could hear the weight of it's step when it climbed, it wasn't a bear it sounded heavier, scarier, different. It got on the top of the roof, and I stayed quiet I knew it meant no good whatever it was. It was standing on the roof and not doing anything just being quiet, but it started screeching like nothing I have heard it my life, it was deafening I blocked my ears with my hands so I wouldn't have to listen to that horrible sound. It stopped, I heard it jump from the roof to the ground, it was a loud thump when it landed. It walked around for a little bit but then it went somewhere far away, I could hear it walking about 200 meters away from me. I wondered for hours what that was, where did it come from? I had a geiger counter in the bed it was built in, and I wanted to see if It was good to go out cause the thing that was on my roof was clearly alive. I checked the geiger counter and I was disappointed to see that it was impossible to go out, so yes I was right this "animal" is not an animal it was something from a different world. I got scared shitless by that thought so I tried to fall asleep. After a few of napping I checked my watch and it was 6 am, checked the gaiger counter, still not possible to go out, drank a little water ate a little food, and started listening for that thing again.

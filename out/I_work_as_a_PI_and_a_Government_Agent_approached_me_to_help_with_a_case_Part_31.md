I’ve never been the type to nap. Not even when I was a child, I would stay awake during nap time when all the other kids in kindergarten would be passed out. After getting wrapped up in all sorts of supernatural cases, naps ambushed me. I would be in the office trying to stay on top of paperwork when I would suddenly jerk awake unaware of when I had fallen asleep. Jimmy would normally let me get sleep when I was able. She tried her best to do whatever paperwork she was able help with on top of her other duties. Getting another person for the office may need to happen soon in the future if we couldn’t keep up with the workload.  

An agent came into the office while I was sleeping. He sat with Jimmy, sipping a coffee as he waited for me to wake up. As I finally woke, I looked over his face which was hidden under some sunglasses, and I tried to remember his name. He was a numbered agent so looked very much like all of his brothers. He wasn’t 706, whom I’d met before. Honestly, he was pleasantly surprised that I could tell the difference between some of them. Standing up, he introduced himself as 526, an older brother of 706. Overall, he was friendly enough. I’ve heard that the numbered agents recently had a bit of a personality shift after their parent became less strict with them. Some even left The Corporation to do other jobs, causing there to be an even heavier case load on the remaining agents. No wonder why they had let a human work on some jobs. They were really lacking in employees.  

“You’ve been requested by someone in holding. I imagine it is to look over their case.” 526 said, explaining why he was there. 

“Holding” sounded a lot like jail. After working on so many cases, I didn’t know how arresting supernatural creatures worked. I assumed they had rights to a trial like humans. Or maybe, trials weren’t needed if they were caught red handed eating or killing people. If that happened, most of the time the creature was killed instead of being arrested based on my experience. I though back to Mirmir from an earlier case. He had killed his abusive employer that had made him and his family slaves. So far, I’ve heard no word on if he was arrested or not. 

Aside from all that, I didn’t have any clue on why someone would want to talk to me about a case.  

“You’ll need to leave behind any magic or metal items. It’s similar to visiting a human in prison. You shouldn't be worried. It is a very safe place and you’ll be behind a reinforced glass wall the entire time.” 

I wasn’t worried until 526 said all of that. My mind was filled with ideas about all the sorts of monsters I may come across. I could refuse this, but I also wanted to know what it was all about just as much as it scared me. Jimmy promised to take care of my wallet and cellphone until I got back. 526 set up the door to my office to connect to the holding building’s door. He told me only certain people had access to this opening. Him and his brothers weren’t overly powerful aside from a very small handful so they were normally forced to run around opening doors for others. If Nick was good at magic, that might have also been his job.  

I debated on if I should have sent Nick a message. He'd been cleared to start working again after the weakness in his legs had gone away. So far, I was just checking to see what someone wanted from me. I wasn’t running a real job and would contact him after I got back to the office depending on what was said. 

526 guided me to a front desk. I needed to sign in and have someone do a quick pat down to ensure I wasn’t carrying in anything dangerous, mostly for my own safety. The agent stayed behind until I was finished. He needed to open a way back to my office because I couldn’t. At least near the front check-in desk there were two chairs and some magazines.  

The building was pretty clean and modern. The white walls were almost too bright to look at. Cameras and spellwork lined the hallway. The one who did the patdown showed me to a door and opened it. He stayed near the door, watching and listening to the entire future exchange. The room was pretty bare. A chair was bolted to the floor, facing a wall with a glass window. Instead of a phone, the window had a speaker in the middle. The person who made the request was already there, sitting on the other side, nervous as hell. 

He wasn’t the monster I thought I would see. He was younger, maybe only twenty. His eyes were a striking shade of green and he had reddish-brown hair. He wasn’t extremely handsome like the other human-like creatures I’ve met. I sat down and he was almost too nervous to speak. 

“Have we met before?” I asked him, not knowing why I was called over. 

“No, never. I heard about a human working as a contract worker and thought I might try my luck. All the agents are all so busy, my request is on the bottom of the pile. And I figured a human might look at what happened in a different way.” 

His voice was strained. He was in a prison after all. His lips were chapped and chewed on, along with his fingernails, which were nibbled down to a painful shortness. Even while he spoke, he kept raising a hand to chew on a finger nail before remembering they were already too short and wincing in pain. I didn’t know how I felt about people talking about me so much that he had heard about a human working for The Corporation while in prison.  

“What can I help with? I don’t promise results but I'll do what I can.” I said, and he relaxed a little. 

“I’m Robin Rice. They might have told you, but probably not. I’m a half breed. My mother was human but passed away when I was born, and my father is a False Wendigo.” 

“A False one?” I asked never hearing the term before. 

Robin nodded, and he seemed perfectly fine explaining the whole thing instead of being upset that the person he’d put his hopes on didn’t know about something so important. 

“Lately the Wendigo myth has been really twisted from what it really is. I don’t know too much about the original indigenous legends, but I know they’re not the deer skull creature most now think of Wendigos. As far as everyone is aware, there hasn’t been recorded proof that a creature like the one described in the legends was ever real. It is possible they were and simply died off. But there are creatures that live in the woods that are very similar to what people now think of as Wendigos. They’ve always worn skulls, but have started to take a liking to deer skulls. They’re tall, thin, pale things that can mimic human voices to lure in victims to eat. Not raw most of the time. They like to cook people. I was really put off when I found out I was related to that sort of thing. It explains why I’m able to eat so much and not gain weight.” 

I couldn’t even imagine what it would be like finding out you were half supernatural creature. Jimmy knew from the start what her father was, and he even helped raise her until he was killed. This didn’t have much to do with why I was there, but I did want to know a bit more. 

“How did you find out? You were adopted right? I mean with your mother gone I doubt you father could raise you without you thinking something was going on.” 

“My mother’s best friends raised me. They were the ones who found her after she went missing in the woods. When I turned eighteen, I wanted to know who my father was. They spilled the truth and I honestly thought they were crazy. It explained a lot about myself if it was true, but I refused to believe that a monster in the woods assaulted my mother before her friends rescued her. I wanted to know the truth so I went to where it happened and volunteered as a park ranger of sorts. My parents were pretty upset I went behind their back to go to a place they thought was dangerous. I quickly found who I assume to be my father. He never gets close. Just stands off in the woods watching...” 

I listened patiently as Robin needed to stop due to stress. His face grew pale thinking about coming across a long-lost parent. I didn’t want to rush him but I also didn’t know if we had a time limit and if I would need to come back tomorrow to hear the rest. He looked up, ready to go on. 

“I kept going back every summer. I actually like doing the outdoor volunteer work. And the creature never got close so it felt safe. I wanted to learn more about him. I really didn’t want to think he harmed my mother, even if he was a monster. All of that led to why I’m here... Some campers they... They went missing. And their remains were found inside a firepit.” 

A sick feeling came over me as I knew what he meant. Some campers died, but that didn’t explained why Robin was arrested. Wouldn’t his father be more of a suspect in the case? Half breeds did gain some of their parent's traits. That didn’t mean Robin was strong enough to overpower a few people and murder them. He knew the question was hovering in the air and he let out a long tired sounding sigh. 

“I’m being treated fine here. They couldn't rule me out off the bat. I was put here for observation. The agents in charge of my case started to look through the woods for my father, but needed to leave for a more pressing matter. If no more campers die, it proves I'm guilty. But if someone is killed while I'm here, I’ll be released.” 

“That’s just not right. They should have finished your case first! This is no way to treat someone.” I was appalled at what I just heard. 

Robin shook his head, not having the energy to get worked up. He understood how bad this all sounded but he could do nothing but accept it. 

“You work for The Corporation. You know how overloaded they are. If a case comes up that has more lives at risk, the priorities shift. I don’t want anyone else to die though...  I was hoping you could go by the site and look it over to check if there are any signs they missed. Only in the daytime though, it’s too dangerous at night. If you can find some sort of proof that a different creature is in those woods, maybe they’ll shut down the campground or something. But I understand if you don’t want to take this request. As far as you know, I’m working with my father. I could be sending you to him to be eaten.” 

That last point was something I didn’t consider. I fully trusted Robin from the moment he started talking. It was a risk, but I did want to keep trusting him. At least if I went looking, I might be able to find the real monster behind all of this and try to put an end to it all regardless if Robin was working along with the murderer or not. If Nick wasn’t available, I would need to go on my own though. 

“I’ll look around for you. Maybe I'll be able to lure it out. I can’t sit around doing nothing when people are in danger.” 

The guard at the back of the room signaled our time was almost up. Robin’s face brightened a little and his eyes welled up. He had called me over, but didn’t really have much hope that I would listen. He had been through a lot since he was locked up. Not only was he stressed out about people getting hurt, he was worried it was his biological father doing it. That weighed down on him, causing him to stress about what kind of person he was if that was where he came from. After this case was sorted and he was out, I would sit down and talk with him so he knew DNA really didn’t matter.  

We were forced to make some quick goodbyes as he was taken away back to his room. I came out from the hallway to find 526 deep in a National Geographic. He quickly stood when he saw me, a little embarrassed someone noticed he was interested in something besides case work.  

“Can I ask to borrow you for a little bit longer?” I said hoping he could get me to where I needed to go. 

With his help, I arrived to the very small town where Robin spent his summers. 526 gave his cellphone number to call when I was ready to be picked up. He also was able to take out a gun with some special bullets because Nick wasn’t answering his phone. I would start this job without him. He held onto the gun I used for work, and 526 thought I needed a better one than the regular handgun I owned. I was very thankful for all of his help. Without another agent on my side, it would be tricky getting this job started. He wasn’t able to stay though. I had used up enough of his time so I let 526 go off to a different job. Someone really ought to give him a nickname. Maybe I could think of one later. 

I rented out a room first, not knowing how long I would be there for. Before arriving, I dropped by my place to grab what I needed to hike through the woods. God, I really hated the woods. Creatures really needed to stop hanging around them. At least I wouldn’t be hanging around them in the dark this time. 

The campground wasn’t too busy. After people were found murdered and eaten, not too many wanted to be in those woods. I checked into the ranger’s station to see what information I could dig up. They did close the campgrounds, but lacked the manpower to fully enforce that rule. No regular visitors were staying, but they had found some people sneaking in at night with cameras, trying to get content for their Youtube channels or their podcasts. During the day, the trails were open. You were required to sign in and make a note of when you left with an estimated time to return. It was easy to see that not knowing who or what had killed the campers was really weighing down on the rangers who stayed. I thanked them and promised I would be out of the woods by nightfall. 

The first day was spent walking around, looking for anything the other agents might have missed. They had left pretty quickly, so didn’t really put much of an effort into looking for other creatures in the woods. The rangers had been out every day along with the regular police looking for anything that might help with the case. The issue was  that they were looking for a human murderer. I was not. Some creatures couldn't be seen by humans unless they wanted to be seen. Since I worked with the supernatural so often, you could say I had gained a better sight for this sort of thing. I might see something the human rangers had missed. 

I was hopeful the first day. Somehow, I stumbled on the crime scene. The caution tape was still up after all the evidence had already been removed. To respect the site, I only looked at it from behind the tape. The firepit was dug out and the ash was taken, and yet it was clear it was there at one point. If I didn’t know what kind of gruesome act happened in those woods, I would find the place peaceful. The silence and stillness of the forest was sinister when you were aware something in the trees hunted and ate humans.  

Standing there, I thought back to a dilemma I hadn’t really focused on for a while.  There were creatures out there that killed and ate humans, and at the same time they were very kind people. Killing was just in their nature. Something they needed to do to live. Charlotte was one of the nicest creatures I’d ever come across. And in order to have children she had to kill a human male in order to hatch her eggs inside him. It made my skin crawl. Was it alright just to say we were different species so it didn’t matter? That they could be killers and yet kindhearted at the same time?  

The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me. I wondered about Robin’s mother. Did she escape on her own, or was she rescued? And why did Robin’s biological father not eat her? I was stuck without answers for a while. Not until I found out what was in those woods. 

When the sun started to set, I left to head back to the motel. Everything was within walking distance so I didn’t need to rent a car during the case. My dinner was a sandwich from the diner that was pretty much attached to the motel. The room itself wasn’t much, but at least it was clean. The cell reception was fine so I could stay caught up on work while on my phone. No matter how many emails I read and replied to, it was like a never-ending battle. When I couldn't keep my eyes open any longer, I turned in for the night. I was a bit disappointed in the lack of progress for the day, but I hoped I could get more tomorrow. 

Something woke me up a few hours later. Being in a strange room confused me for a minute until I remembered where I was. I didn’t dare turn on the light. Taking a hold of the gun under my pillow, I crawled towards the window, trying to peek from under the curtains and hoping whatever woke me wouldn't notice. The thin material barely kept out the light of the neon motel sign. I knew I heard something just outside the room. The motel was only one floor and I regretted getting a room so close to the woods. I didn’t even know any magic to keep my door locked against creatures.  

I froze, my body turning to ice when a shape appeared outside the window. A tall thin person just outside. A hand rose with long fingers to touch the window. The head ducked down causing me to muffle a gasp. A skull with antlers could clearly be seen through the curtains. I could hear the creature dragging a finger over the glass in a circle. I knew the thing just made a spell on the glass. I darted to the door. Bracing myself, I opened it ready to confront the monster, gun raised. My hand shook slightly as I rushed outside to look at my window to see nothing. No creature standing outside without any trace of it. Feeling a set of eyes on my neck, I looked just in time to see a tall pale shape go behind some trees off on the other side of the parking lot. 

Crouching down to where I thought the creature was drawing the circle, I breathed on the glass, fogging it up. For a brief moment, I saw some spell work in a language I didn’t understand. When I fogged up the glass a second time to try and take a photo, the entire thing didn’t show up again. That thing could have come into my room while I was sleeping. So why didn’t it? What was the spell for?  

I should have gotten another room. It was only a few hours until dawn so I went back inside and stayed up for the rest of the night ready to go back to the woods for answers as soon as the sun came up. 

The thing in the woods knew I was there. Without any kind of proof, I couldn’t get Robin free. I was tired, but I laced up my boots and got ready to go hiking and try to find what I had come across the night before. Instead of the trail, I started where I thought I saw the shape disappear last night. Some dirt was disturbed, showing I was on the right track. My hiking and tracking skills were pretty much nonexistent. I should only go a few steps into the woods. If I could no longer see the motel, I’d gone too far. The last thing anyone needed was for me to get lost. Before heading into the trees, I sent Nick another message. It wasn’t like him to not reply. Even on busy jobs he did his best to send a message back letting me know if he wasn’t able to talk. 

The day was already pretty hot. The season was getting closer to autumn without any sign of the heat going away any time soon. The short hike didn’t really provide any more clues. The footprints could just be from a very tall human. It didn’t prove a monster was in those woods. I was about to turn back to see if there was a way I could lure the creature out, when laughing came from above the trees. Wind blew, making it impossible to pin down the sound. The unaddressed trauma of dealing with the Witch caused me to react. I ran behind a tree, frantic to try and hide. When the laughter got closer, I ran again. My mind soon caught up to my body forcing me to stop. My poor reaction had caused me to get completely lost in the woods already. Looking around, I thought a path looked familiar so I went for it. I needed to get out of the woods and not just run around blindly. 

That laughter followed. It was as if a hundred school children were all playing at once. Different from the bone chilling Witch laugh. And yet it was something I didn’t want to hear in the woods. My sense of direction turned out to be utterly useless. The way I picked led deeper into the trees, that laughter mocking my every step.  

A fluttering came down from the trees. At first, I assumed it was a leaf and brushed it off. When something grabbed my hand, I turned trying to see what it was. Countless shapes came down from the tree tops, that devilish giggling getting closer. They swarmed my sight, blinding me. I was unable to get the flapping dark shapes away as I walked backwards and right down a gully. Slipping without anything to grab a hold of, I tumbled down. My ankle got caught on an exposed root and twisted painfully before I reached the bottom. It was by sheer luck that I didn’t smash my head in. While I was recovering, the laughter stopped. 

All those shapes landed on top of the gully, staring down at where I landed. Now that they were staying still, I could see what they were. Cursing myself, I recognized them. One fluttered down. Larger than the rest. It could fit inside the palm of my hand. Holding out my hand, it landed on it. It had eight wings made of what looked to be dark, nearly black leaves. The body was long and brown, matching bark. It was also similar to a butterfly body, just with a more human top half and face. They pretended to be shadows under leaves, so were called Flutter Shades. A few have been inside my office requesting food. They eat rotting flesh of animals inside the forest. Sometimes they would steal anything campers left unguarded. I wish they would have just told me what they were before freaking me out like that. 

“You are the Sky Man. We’ve heard of you.” The creature said, its many arms nervously fiddling. “Our prank was not fun for you. You are hurt.” 

“It’s fine. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat. It’ll take a while, but I’ll be able to walk out if you guide the way.” 

Overall, I felt stupid. Yes, there were countless creatures lurking in the night that killed humans without a second thought. Some with bodies so horrible it would make you go crazy just by looking at them. And I just ran from one of the most harmless of the bunch. 

“No, No. Bad idea. We’ll bring back help.” 

The small creature lifted into the air along with the rest. I told them it was fine, but they ignored me. I was left at the bottom of a slope with a bad ankle and no idea of how to get out of the woods. No wonder why Nick said not to do jobs without him. He would never let me live this down. For once, my phone was working. I could call for someone to come and get me. Or wait until The Flutter Shades brought someone here to help out. Maybe the person they got wouldn’t laugh at me.

I’ve never been the type to nap. Not even when I was a child, I would stay awake during nap time when all the other kids in kindergarten would be passed out. After getting wrapped up in all sorts of supernatural cases, naps ambushed me. I would be in the office trying to stay on top of paper work when I would suddenly jerk awake unaware of when I fell asleep. Jimmy would normally let me get sleep when I could. She tried her best to do what paper work she could on top of her other duties. Getting another person for the office may need to happen soon in the future if we couldn’t keep up with the work load.  

An agent came into the office while I napped. He sat with Jimmy sipping a coffee as he waited for me to naturally wake up. Looking over his face hidden under some sunglasses I tried to remember his name. He was a numbered agent so looked very much like his brothers. He wasn’t 706 I’ve met before. Honestly, he looked pleasantly surprised that I could tell the difference between some of them. Standing up he introduced himself as 526, an older brother of 706. Overall, he acted friendly enough. I’ve heard that the numbered agents recently had a bit of a personality shift after their parent became less strict on them. Some even left The Corporation do other jobs causing there to be an even heavier case load on the remaining agents. No wonder why they let a human work on some jobs. They were really lacking in employees.  

“You’ve been requested by someone in holding. I imagine it is to look over their case.” 526 explained why he was there. 

Holding sounded a lot like jail. After doing so many cases, I didn’t know how arresting supernatural creatures worked. I assumed they had rights to a trial like humans. Or maybe, trials weren’t needed if they were caught red handed eating or killing people. If that happened, most of the time the creature was killed instead of being arrested. I though back to Mirmir from an earlier case. He killed his abusive employer that made him and his family slaves. So far, I’ve heard no word on if he'd been arrested or not. 

Aside from all that, I didn’t have any clue on why someone would want to talk with me over a case.  

“You’ll need to leave behind any magic items or metal. It’s similar to visiting a human in prison. You shouldn't be worried. It is a very safe place and you’ll be behind an enforced glass wall the entire time.” 

I wasn’t worried until 526 said all of that. My mind was filled with all sorts of ideas of what kind of monster I may come across. I could refuse this, but I also wanted to know what it all about just as much as it scared me. Jimmy promised to take care of my wallet and cellphone until I got back. 526 set up the door to my office to connect to the holding building’s door. He told me only certain people had access to this opening. Him and his brothers weren’t overly powerful aside from a very small handful so they were normally forced to run around opening doors for others. If Nick was good at magic, that might have also been his job.  

I debated on if I should have sent Nick a message. He'd been cleared to start working again after his weakness in his legs recovered. So far, I was just checking to see what someone wanted from me. I wasn’t do a real job and would contact him after I got back to the office depending on what was said. 

526 guided me along to a front desk. I needed to sign in and have someone do a quick pat down to ensure I wasn’t carrying in anything dangerous, mostly for my own safety. The agent stayed behind until I finished. He needed to open a way back to my office because I couldn’t. At least near the front check in desk sat two chairs and some magazines.  

The building was pretty clean and modern. The white walls were almost too bright to look at. Cameras and spell work lined the hallway. The one who did the frisk down showed me to a door and opened it. He stayed near the door, watching and listening the entire future exchange. The room pretty bare. A chair bolted to the floor facing a wall with a glass window. Instead of a phone, the window had a speaker in the middle. The person who made the request already there sitting on the other side nervous as hell. 

He wasn’t the monster I thought I would see. He was younger, maybe only twenty. His eyes a striking shade of green and reddish-brown hair. He wasn’t extremely handsome like the other human like creature's I’ve met. I sat down and he acted almost too nervous to speak. 

“Have we met before?” I asked him not knowing why I was called over. 

“No, never. I heard about a human working as a contract worker and thought I might try my luck. All the agents are all so busy, my request is on the bottom of the pile. And I figured a human might look at what happened in a different way.” 

His voice sounded strained. He was in a prison after all. His lips were chapped and chewed on, along with his fingernails. Each nibbled down to a painful shortness. Even while he spoke, he kept raising a hand to chew on a finger nail before remembering they were already too short and winced in pain. I didn’t know how I felt about people talking about me so much that he heard about a human working for The Corporation while in prison.  

“What can I help with? I don’t promise results but I'll do what I can.” I said and he eased a little. 

“I’m Robin Rice. They might have told you, maybe not. I’m a half breed. My mother was human but passed away when I was born, and my father is a False Wendigo.” 

“A False one?” I asked never hearing the term before. 

Robin nodded perfectly alright explaining it instead of upset the person he’d put his hopes in didn’t know something so important. 

“Lately the Wendigo myth has been really twisted from what it really is. I don’t know too much about the original indigenous legends, but I know they’re not the deer skull creature most now think of Wendigos. As far as everyone is aware, there hasn’t been recorded proof of a creature like in the legends ever was real. It is possible they were and died off. But there are creatures that live in the woods that are very similar to people now think to be as Wendigos. They’ve always worn skulls, but started to take a liking to deer skulls. They’re tall, thin pale things that can mimic human voices to lure in victims to eat. Not raw most of the time. They like to cook people. I was really put off when I found out I was related to that sort of thing. It explains why I’m able to eat so much and not gain weight.” 

I couldn’t even imagine what it would be like finding out you were half supernatural creature. Jimmy knew from the start what her father was, and he even helped raise her until he was killed. This didn’t have much to do with why I was there, but I did want to know a bit more. 

“How did you find out? You were adopted right? I mean with your mother gone I doubt you father could raise you without you thinking something was going on.” 

“My mother’s best friends raised me. They were the ones who found her after she went missing in the woods. When I turned eighteen, I wanted to know who my father was. They spilled the truth and I really thought they were crazy. It explained a lot about myself if it was true but I refused to believe that a monster in the woods assaulted my mother before her friends rescued her. I wanted to know for sure, so I went to where it happened and volunteered as a park ranger sort of thing. My parents were pretty upset I went behind their back to go to a place they thought was dangerous. I quickly found who I assume to be my father. He never gets close. Just stands off in the woods watching...” 

I listened patiently as Robin needed to stop from stress. His face grew pale thinking about coming across a long lost parent. I didn’t rush him but also, didn’t know if we had a time limit and if I needed to come back tomorrow to hear the rest. He looked up ready to go on. 

“I kept going back every summer. I like doing the outdoor volunteer work. And the creature never got close so it felt safe. I wanted to learn more about him. I really didn’t want to think he harmed my mother, even if he was a monster. All of that led to why I’m here... Some campers they... They went missing. And their remains were found inside a firepit.” 

A sick feeling came over me as I knew what he meant. Some campers died, but that didn’t explained why Robin been arrested. Wouldn’t his father be more of a suspect in the case? Half breeds did gain some of their parent's traits. That didn’t mean Robin would be strong enough to overpower a few people to murder them. He knew the question was hovering in the air and he let out a long tired sounding sigh. 

“I’m being treated fine here. They couldn't rule me out off the bat. I was put here for observation. The agents in charge of my case started to look through the woods for my father, but needed to leave for a more pressing matter. If no more campers die, it proves I'm innocent. But if someone is killed while I'm here, I’ll be released.” 

“That’s just not right. They should have finished your case first! This is no way to treat someone.” I was appalled at what I just heard. 

Robin shook his head, not having the energy to get worked up. He understood how bad this all sounded and could do nothing but accept it. 

“You work for The Corporation. You know how overloaded they are. If a case come up with more lives at risk, the priorities shift. I don’t want anyone else to die though...  I was hoping you could go by the site and look over seeing if there are any signs they missed. Only in the daytime. It’s too dangerous at night. If you can find some sort of proof a different creature is in those woods, maybe they’ll shut down the camp ground or something. But I understand if you don’t want to take this request. As far as you know, I’m working with my father. I could be sending you to him to be eaten.” 

That last point something I didn’t consider. I fully trusted Robin the moment he started talking. It was a risk, but I did want to keep trusting him. At least if I went looking, I might be able to find the real monster behind all of this and try to put an end to it all regardless if Robin was working along with the murderer or not. If Nick wasn’t available, I would need to go on my own though. 

“I’ll look around for you. Maybe I'll be able to lure it out. I can’t sit around doing nothing when people are in danger.” 

The guard at the back of the room signalled our time was almost up. Robin’s face brightened a little and tears came to the corners of his eyes. He did call me over, but didn’t really have that much hope I would listen. He's been through a lot since he was locked up. Not only was he stressed out about people getting hurt, he worried his biological father killed humans. That weighted down on him causing him to stress about what kind of person he might be if that's what he came from. After this case got sorted and he was out, I would sit down and talk with him so he knew DNA really didn’t matter.  

We were forced to make some quick good byes as he was taken away back to his room. I came out from the hallway to find 526 deep in a National Geographic. He quickly stood when he saw me, a little embarrassed someone noticed he was interested in something besides case work.  

“Can I ask to borrow you for a little bit longer?” I said hoping he could get me to where I needed to go. 

With his help, I arrived to the very small town where Robin spent his summers. 526 gave his cellphone number to call when I was ready to be picked up. He also able to take out a gun with some special bullets because Nick wasn’t answering his phone. I would start this job without him. He held onto the gun I used for work, and 526 thought I needed one better than the regular handgun I owned. I felt very thankful for all of his help. Without another agent on my side, it would be tricky getting this job started. He wasn’t able to stay though. I used up enough of his time and let 526 go off to a different job. Someone really needed to give him a nickname. 

I rented out a room first not knowing how long I would be there for. Before arriving, I dropped by my place to grab what I needed to hike through the woods. God, I really hated the woods. Creatures really needed to stop hanging around them. At least I wouldn’t be in the woods in the dark this time. 

The camp ground wasn’t too busy. After people were found murdered and eaten, not too many wanted to be in those woods. I checked into the ranger’s station to see what information I could dig up. They did close the camp grounds, but lacked the man power to fully enforce that rule. Any normal people weren’t staying, but they found some sneaking in at night with camera’s trying to get content for their Youtube channels, or podcasts. During the day, the trails were open. You were required to sign in and make a note of when you left with a guess of when you would be back. It was easy to see not knowing who killed the campers was really weighing down the rangers who stayed. I thanked them and promised I would be out of the woods by nightfall. 

The first day was walking around looking for anything the other agents might have missed. They left pretty quickly, so didn’t really put much of an effort into looking for other creatures in the woods. The rangers had been out every day along with the regular police looking for anything to help with the case. The issue being they were looking for a human murderer. I was not. Some creatures couldn't be seen by humans unless they wanted to be seen. Since I worked with the supernatural so often, I gained better eyesight for this sort of thing. I might see something the human rangers missed. 

I felt hopeful the first day. Somehow, I stumbled on the crime scene. The caution tape still up after all evidence had already been removed. To respect the site, I only looked at it from behind the tape. The firepit dug out and ash taken, and yet it was clear it was there at one point. If I didn’t know what kind of gruesome act happened in those woods, I would find the place peaceful. The silence and stillness of the forest was sinister when you were aware something in the trees hunted and ate humans.  

Standing there, I thought back to a dilemma I hadn’t really focused on for a while.  There were creatures out there that killed and ate humans, and at the same time they were very kind people. Killing was just in their nature. Something they needed to do to live. Charlotte honestly one of the nicest persons I’ve ever come across. And in order to have children she must kill a human male to hatch eggs inside. It made my skin crawl. Was it alright just to say we were different species so it didn’t matter? They could be killers and kind at the same time?  

The more I thought about it, the more it bothered me. I wondered about Robin’s mother. Did she escape on her own, or was she rescued? And why did Robin’s biological father not eat her? I got stuck without answers for a while. Not until I found out what lurked in those woods. 

When the sun started to set, I left to head back to the motel. Everything within walking distance so I didn’t need to rent a car during the case. My dinner a sandwich from the diner pretty much attached to the motel. The room itself wasn’t much, but at least it was clean. The cell reception was fine so I could stay caught up on work while on my phone. No matter how many emails I read and replied to, it was like a never-ending battle. When I couldn't keep my eyes open much longer, I turned in for the night a bit disappointed in the lack of progress for the day. 

Something woke me up a few hours later. Being in a strange room confused me for a minute. I didn’t dare turn on the light. Taking a hold of the gun under my pillow, I crawled towards the window trying to peek from under the curtains hoping whatever woke me wouldn't notice. The thin material barely keeping out the light of the neon motel sign. I knew I heard something just outside the room. The motel was only one floor and I regretted getting a room so close to the woods. I didn’t even know any magic to keep my door locked against creatures.  

I froze, my body turning to ice when a shape appeared outside the window. A tall thin person just outside. A hand rose with long fingers to touch the window. The head ducked down causing me to muffle a gasp. A skull with antlers could clearly be seen through the curtains. I could hear the creature dragging a finger over the glass in a circle. I knew the thing just made a spell on the glass. I darted to the door. Bracing myself, I opened it ready to confront the monster, gun raised. My hand shook slightly as I rushed outside to look at my window to see, nothing. No creature standing outside without any trace of it. Feeling a set of eyes on my neck, I looked just in time to see a tall pale shape go behind some trees off on the other side of the parking lot. 

Crouching down to where I thought the creature drew the circle, I breathed on the glass, fogging it up. For a brief moment, I saw some spell work in a language I didn’t understand. When I fogged up the glass a second time to try and take a photo, the entire thing didn’t show up again. That thing could have come into my room while I was sleeping. So why didn’t it? What was the spell for?  

I should have gotten another room. It was only a few hours until dawn so I went back inside and stayed up for the rest of the night ready to go inside the woods when the sun came up for answers.  

The thing in the woods knew I was there. Without any kind of proof, I couldn’t get Robin free. Lacing up my boots, I felt tired, but ready to go hiking trying to find what I came across the night before. Instead of the trail, I started where I thought I saw the shape disappear last night. Some dirt was disturbed showing I would be on the right track. My hiking and tracking skills were pretty much nonexistent. I should only go a few steps in the woods. If I could no longer see the motel, I’ve gone too far. The last thing anyone needed was for me to get lost. Before heading into the trees, I send Nick another message. It wasn’t like him to not reply. Even on busy jobs he did his best to send a message back saying he wasn’t able to talk any time soon. 

The day was already pretty hot. The season was getting closer to autumn without any sign of the heat going anyway any time soon. The short hike didn’t really provide any more clues. The foot prints could be from a very tall human. It didn’t prove a monster was in those woods. I was about to turn back to see if there was a way I could lure the creature out, when laughing came from above the trees. Wind blew, making it impossible to pin down the sound. The unaddressed trauma of dealing with the Witch caused me to react. I ran behind a tree, frantic to try and hide. When the laughter got closer, I ran again. My mind soon caught up to my body forcing me to stop. My poor reaction causing me to get completely lost in the woods already. Looking around, I thought a path looked familiar so I went for it. I needed to get out of the woods and not just running blindly. 

That laughter followed. It was as if a hundred school children were all playing at once. Different from the bone chilling Witch laugh. And yet something I didn’t want to hear in the woods. My sense of direction turned out to be utterly useless. The way I picked led deeper into the trees, that laughter mocking every step.  

A fluttering came down from the trees. At first, I assumed it was a leaf and brushed it off. When something grabbed my hand, I turned trying to see what it looked like. Countless shapes came down from the tree tops, that devilish giggling getting closer. They swarmed my sight, blinding me. I was unable to get the flapping dark shapes away as I walked backwards and right down a gully. Slipping without anything to grab a hold of, I tumbled down. My ankle catching on an exposed root, twisting painfully by the time I reached the bottom. It was lucky I didn’t smash my head in. While I was recovering. The laughter stopped. 

All those shapes landed on top of the gully, staring down at where I landed. Now that they were staying still, I could see what they were. Cursing myself, I recognized them. One fluttered down. Larger than the rest. It could fit inside the palm of my hand. Holding out my hand, it landed on it. It had eight wings made of what looked to be dark, nearly black leaves. The body was long and brown, matching bark. It was also similar to a butterfly body, just with a more human top half and face. They pretended to be shadows under leaves, so were called Flutter Shades. A few have been inside my office requesting food. They eat rotting flesh of animals inside the forest. Sometimes they would steal anything campers left unguarded. I wish they would have just told me what they were before freaking me out like that. 

“You are they Sky Man. We’ve heard of you.” The creature said the many arms nervously fiddling. “Our prank was not fun for you. You are hurt.” 

“It’s fine. I’m a bit of a scaredy-cat. It’ll take a while, but I’ll be able to walk out of you guide the way.” 

Overall, I felt stupid. Yes, there were countless creatures lurking in the night that killed humans without a second thought. Some with bodies so horrible it would make you go crazy just by looking at them. And I just ran from one of the more harmless of the bunch. 

“No, No. Bad. We’ll bring back help.” 

The small creature lifted into the air along with the rest. I told them it was fine, but they ignored me. I got left at the bottom of a slope with a bad ankle with no idea how to get out of the woods. No wonder why Nick said not to do jobs without him. He would never let me live this down. For once, my phone worked. I could call for someone to come and get me. Or wait until The Flutter Shades brought someone here to help out. Maybe the person they got wouldn’t laugh at me.

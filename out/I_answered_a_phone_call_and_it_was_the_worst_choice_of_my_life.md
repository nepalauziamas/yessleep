I’ve made poor decisions in my life, I won’t lie.

We don’t have to go into detail about any of them because this isn’t a therapy session and whoever reads this (if anyone does) certainly isn’t my goddamn shrink. I guess I’m someone who thinks a lot about things they shouldn’t, and then forgets to consider the things that really matter. Most of the poor decisions I make are because of this reason, and I think this is one that continues the unfortunate pattern.

A while back, like a week ago, I was in a little bit of a rough spot money-wise. This sort of thing happens a lot, because I gamble a lot. It’s an addiction, I guess, and it’s a rough one. I borrow money from people to make more money. Sometimes the luck pays off and sometimes it doesn’t, so I’m put in the unenviable position of having to pay the money back. And when I don’t have all the cash in the world to give back, I have to ask more people.

So four days ago I’m going through my daily routine of shaking my wallet out for pennies, combing my savings, you get the deal, when my friend calls me up. We’ll call her A, she’s 22, and we hadn’t really spoken since high school. I use the word friend really loosely and I think I need to re-evaluate my relationships.

Anyway, she calls me up, right, and I pick up because I honestly don’t do jack shit during the day. I don’t remember too much of the phone call except for the later half of it, but I’ll try to tell you how it went, for the sake of keeping the record real.

There was the pleasantries, me asking how she is (she’s married with a kid on the way, fast-tracked her Bachelor’s), her asking me how I am (not married with no kids on the way, did not fast-track my Bachelor’s), and just some gossipping about all our old classmates at first. Then we get a little pleasantry-less , and I ask her why she called me up.

She’s silent for a little while, and then I find out her husband is rich as balls. But I find this out in the most embarrassing way: it turns out her husband owns a fucking casino and he likes to tour in it, from time to time. Now, what would you know, he decided to walk around there three days ago! There was a bit of a ruckus the time he did go, something about someone losing a game of Texas Hold’Em who thought the other players were cheating! He took a look at one of them, thought, hey, this person looks familiar, and why don’t I go tell my wife a funny story about it, ha ha motherfuckin ha!

At this point I’m casually thinking about ending it all, you know, strapping myself to a rocket and being all like “*The time for death is nigh!”* and all that, thanks to Mister Motherfucking Casino. Now you’re probably thinking, why such an extreme reaction over something that seems like average casino activity? Dear Reddit user, I looked like a loser. And it was pretty obvious, given the way I was dressed and the way I was losing the game.  So A’s husband recognized me and told her about how I looked like such a big loser, which is really embarrassing for me, because the last time I saw A was at graduation, along with all my other classmates.

And the last thing I told all of them to their faces was the next time any of them so much as heard about me, I’d be the richest asshole on this side of the continent. As you can gather, the next time A heard about me, I was not… the richest.

But the next thing she said to me on the phone call caught my attention.

When I was younger, my English teacher told me about how to write a good, proper introduction to a story to get readers to be interested in it. You had to have what she called a *hook,* like a fishing line.

And A was probably the best fisherwoman out there.

She cast the hook (*“So you’re not the richest yet like you said you’d be, huh?”*) and then the line caught (*I said, “A, what the hell do you think?”*), and then she started reeling the fish in *(a sharp laugh, and then: “What if I told you I knew a quick way?”)*.

Like I said, poor decisions. Don’t be like me, dear Reddit user.

She told me about a job that she *desperately* needed done, and she said the pay was so good, and all I had to do was one simple task, and would I just do it for her, for old times’ sake, please?

So I bit the bait, and I asked, “So what’s this about?”

There was a house, A said. Not old and abandoned and sketchy–it was in a cul-de-sac, and I had to go in and make a delivery. It was a cardboard box, and I just needed to make sure it got to the house safely. Oh, and no shaking the box, please. You’ll get forty thousand dollars that afternoon in cash. You’ll get the parcel by tonight at the latest if you agree, and you can deliver it tomorrow morning, please.

I’m not a fool, so I considered the possibility that it could be something sketchy. Worst came to worst, I died, right? I agreed to the offer less than a minute later. It was forty thousand! More money than I’ve ever seen in my entire life!

And the thing is, before the gambling hit me and I became a complete loser, I was pretty decent at driving, so I figured a package delivery for that much was fine to handle. It didn’t cross my mind to ask what exactly I’d be delivering and where I’d be going, though, until A had hung up. Like I said, I don’t think enough about things sometimes.

But even if it was drugs, and I got arrested for peddling or something, I’d just say I didn’t know what was in it! If the box stayed sealed, and I had the phone call to corroborate things, they couldn’t just throw me in jail, I thought.

I didn’t really do much else that day. Fell asleep sometime in the late afternoon and early evening, and woke up to the doorbell. It was an awful, awful noise, but the landlady didn’t do anything about it and no one really used it all that much, so it was the kind of thing I forgot about until it rang again. I tried to run to the door to see who’d dropped it off, but by the time I opened it all I saw was a shadow, so I grabbed the package, closed the door, and figured either A or Mister Motherfucking Casino had dropped it off.

When I looked at the box, I remembered A had told me not to shake it, so I held it like I’d hold a baby, and set it on the kitchen counter. It had a yellow sticky note on the top of it, and the sticky note had an address and two bulletpoints on it, and the handwriting was super tiny so I had to squint a bit to read it.

I’m not gonna mention the address here for obvious reasons, but here were the bulletpoints:

* *When you get there, knock on the door twice.*
* *FACE THE DOOR UNTIL IT OPENS. DON’T TALK.*

I didn’t think too much of the second rule till the morning of, and the more I thought about it, the capital letters scared me. But it was forty thousand, and I’d seen enough horror movies. I thought to myself, *well, it doesn’t look like I need to go in the house. If all else fails, I can just hi-tail it out of there.*

So I drove myself and the box there, a twenty minute drive, and I kept on looking over at the passenger seat to make sure it didn’t shake. I figured it probably had something expensive and fragile, given the amount of money I would be getting for delivering it.  In fact, there was a point along the route where the GPS was telling me to go over a bumpy route, but I just took another street where the road was smoother instead–any delivery places seeing this, I’m committed. Hire me.

When I saw the house number, I parked my car, got the box, and walked out.

I knocked on the door twice, set the box down, and waited.

And waited and waited and waited. At some point, I figured it had been, like, an hour, and I wanted to go, but I remembered the rules, and the money, so I stood there.

When I heard the guy behind me, though, I realized I’d fucked up.

It started out normal enough. Someone was like, “Hey, you’ve been standing here awhile. Are you at the right house?”

When I didn’t answer, the one-sided inquiries turned harsher. He started asking me if I was a criminal, a robber, someone there to kill the person in the house. He told me. “Get off the porch now, I’m calling the fucking cops!”

I started shaking, but I didn’t turn around.

When I heard what sounded like sirens, eventually I heard them get louder as they got closer and closer to me, and then I heard the police officers asking me to turn around. They got more and more agitated as I didn’t respond, and eventually I felt footsteps, and someone coming up and putting what felt like a gun *to my head,* telling me to get off the porch.

You know what’s interesting about human biology? At a certain point in time, when we get stressed enough, or scared enough, we have physical reactions to it. When our fear surpasses our mental threshold, sometimes we go into shock. Have heart attacks. Sometimes, it’s adrenaline. I was one of the people who, when that threshold was passed, was lucky enough to not have a strong physical reaction. I just … stopped processing things.

At some point, the door to the house must have opened, because the voices stopped trying to get me to turn around. I opened my eyes, and I could barely see because of how swollen from crying they were. My jaw felt locked from where my teeth ground together so tight in a conscious effort to stop from screaming. Someone came out, took the package, and handed me an envelope. I took it, and turned around and ran to my car.

As I ran down the porch to the sidewalk and jumped into my car, I noticed that there was no one there. Not a police car, nor neighbors. Not one person was out on the lawns or the sidewalks, that I could see. I got back in my car, drove back to my house, and spent a good three days shaking.

I couldn’t handle the idea that it had been something horrific and supernatural, however, so my mind gravitated to the next best thing: a prank.

I thought A and Mister Motherfucking Casino were messing around with me, thinking maybe they’d somehow hated me so much after graduation that they’d hired out one of those prank companies or whatever. I spent a day trying to call A about that, but all the calls bounced straight to *this number doesn’t exist.* The bitch deactivated her number, I thought, what an awful prank. I tried to stalk her and her husband on social media too, but I couldn’t see any of their profiles.

I seethed over that thought for three days, but I had my money, all forty thousand dollars, so I was thinking, *hey, at least I got something out of it.*

But the thing is, I checked the address of the house today, you know, went through Zillow and all that, and it said who the last owners were. We’ll call them Mr. P and Mrs. P. But another Internet search/stalking session showed that they both were on vacation in Florida. So I messaged them on their Instagrams, sent them both an earful, asking them why they would participate in such a prank. Mr. P responded not even five minutes after, and he was super puzzled. We had an argument because I told him I wasn’t buying his bullshit and I wanted to know what exactly he got out of pranking me like this.  He said, *nothing!!!*, and then he called me.

I did *not* want to accept the call at first, let me tell you, but I was so fucking pissed that it outweighed my fear. So I picked up the second Instragram call, and Mrs. P popped up in the frame too, and we talked for three-ish hours. I’ll spare you the fear-filled specifics of the argument, but basically I found out that they had never authorized any package delivery, I showed them the sticky-note with their address on it, and they’re booking a flight back immediately so we can figure out what the fuck is going on. I’m gonna update this for sure, but I’m putting this here because it seems like a lot of the people on this Reddit are going through worse shit than I am.

Either this is some elaborate prank or actual real supernatural shit, and either way, it’s really fucking horrifying. A and Mister Motherfucking Casino, if you’re reading this, I’m gonna sue you once I get to the bottom of this.

And even though I don’t think anyone will be reading this, if you have *any* idea, please let me know. I’ve called up literally everyone possible to ask them about this, sent out mass texts, posted on my story, and so far I have over 100 people sending me laughing emojis and a few classmates from graduation telling me to not be a loser and saying I’m delusional.

But here’s the thing: the only thing I’m addicted to is gambling. Never even touched drugs or alcohol, not because I think I’m some holier-than-thou person for not doing them, but just because beer smells piss-awful and the weirdos who post weed on their snapchat stories use those weird fonts to type out “delivery places” so I’ve never really considered going there. The only “proof” I have is a picture of the box with the sticky note on it, though.

I think Mr. and Mrs. P will probably know better than me what to do, though. They told me their house had a security camera on it, and Mr. P was able to use his app to view me being on the porch for an hour before it shorted out. I *really* hope the shorting out was because of their camera running out of battery and not anything else, though.

Honestly, I’m gonna use this as a diary of sorts. I don’t sincerely think anyone will even see this on here, but no harm ever came from a Hail Mary, I guess. I’ll [add an update](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v521x0/boxes_keep_on_showing_up_at_my_doorstep_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when I see Mr. and Mrs. P, though.

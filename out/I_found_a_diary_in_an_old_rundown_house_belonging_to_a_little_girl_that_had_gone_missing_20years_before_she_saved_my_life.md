 

I had just turned 15 that day, my friend Jane wanted to celebrate with a bottle of vodka she stole from her dad, but I was afraid my parents would catch me. They already hated Jane, they thought she was trouble, she basically has no rules at home and was allowed to do whatever she wanted, and of course she took advantage.  

My dad always said she will end up in prison someday and he didn’t want me to go down the same road. He was only looking for a reason to keep me away from her, so I wasn’t going to let him find one. 

Jane suggested we go into the forest, there was a rundown house where an old guy used to live, it was said he kidnapped and killed 5 kids, but got away with it, because they never found the bodies. Apparently, he disappeared after that, some say one of the parents killed and buried him in the forest, others say he still lives out there, somewhere, waiting for his next victim.  

I always believed it was just a scary story someone made up to frighten kids, but I will admit the thoughts of going there at night did freak me out a little. It was dusk by the time we arrived, Jacky and Pam were supposed to meet us there, but they chickened out at the last minute.  

It didn’t seem like much of a celebration with just two of us, so I wanted to go back to Pam’s house, I had told my parents I was staying there anyways. But Jane wouldn’t give up so easy and told me she wouldn’t leave even if it meant staying there on her own.  

I couldn’t leave her like that, plus it would have been a long walk home through that dark forest, all alone, so I didn’t really have a choice but to go inside with her. I had never been there before, so I was expecting broken windows and falling ceilings, but it was in really good condition considering how long it was derelict, even the doorbell still worked. We got in through the kitchen window, it was partly open, inside it didn’t look too bad either apart from an odd smell coming from the bathroom. 

Everything else was fine we even found a radio in the sitting room, so we sat down, made ourselves comfortable and started drinking. I was still a little nervous, but I soon relaxed after a few drinks. Jane got really drunk but I didn’t drink anywhere near as much as her, so after a few hours I sobered up and wanted to go back to Pam’s house. It didn’t take long to convince Jane to go with me when she was in that state. I thought the walk would help sober her up anyways. 

We tried going out the front door, but it was locked, so we decided to go out the way we came in, the window was still open when we got there. But when I climbed onto the sink it suddenly slammed shut by itself, so I opened it, but instantly slammed shut again. This time I held it open for Jane and she got out, she was supposed to do the same for me. But as soon as Jane got out the window came crashing down and the light suddenly went out. 

I tried everything to open that window, but it wouldn’t budge, being locked in there all by myself really started to freak me out, I told Jane to try find something to break it. I did the same, but it was dark, so I had to feel around with my hands, eventually I found myself at the bottom of the stairs. Then with a loud bang the lights came on, at first, I thought the noise was Jane trying to break the window and started making my way to the kitchen, but then out of the corner of my eye, I saw a shadow moving in the sitting room, followed by what sounded like a child's laugh.  

When I turned around the light was flickering, before completely going out. As I stared into the darkness, I felt something staring back at me, I didn’t know what it was, but I knew it was there, I could feel it in the air, just like you would before a thunderstorm. 

Trying not to panic I started slowly backing up towards the kitchen, when suddenly I heard someone whistling, it was coming from behind me, when I turned around the door slammed shut and all the lights went out, apart from upstairs.  

I had nowhere else to go so, I ran up those stairs as fast as I could and tried to hide, at the top there was a long hallway which led to an open door at the end. The whistling started to get louder, and I heard footsteps slowly moving towards me, before the lights in the hallway went out. The only light now was coming from the room with the open door. I really didn’t want to go in there, so one by one I tried every door on the way down, but they were locked.  

What choice had I but to go in there or else face whatever was walking up those stairs. Upon entering the room, I slammed the door behind me, there was three bolts on the inside, I had no sooner closed the last one when the whistling suddenly stopped, he was right outside the door. I will never forget how quiet it was, I think that was the scariest part, it felt like an eternity. 

Then BANG, the door started to shake. BANG, I could see the bottom lock start to give in. BANG, a crack started moving down the middle of the door. I ran to the window and tried to get out, but it was boarded up, then the closet door swung open, where I jumped in and tried to hide. Suddenly the banging stopped, and the whistling started again, this time it sounded like it was moving away from me. 

As I was crouching in there, crying, too scared to move, I started to feel something crack beneath my feet, then one of my legs fell through the floor. I tried to pull it out, but it was stuck. The timber was old and rotted so I used my other leg to smash it, when I pulled my leg out, I realized something else was in there, a diary.  

The cover was old and brittle, it crumbled when I picked it up, it was obviously there for a long time. When I opened it there was weird symbols inside the front and back cover, I think whoever owned it was Spanish, Italian or something like that, because I couldn’t understand it, but as I flicked through, I realized some of the entries were in English. 

The first one said, “I have been trapped here for far too long, I feel like I am losing my mind. There is only me and Maria left, but it won’t take long before she will be taken upstairs too, like the rest of them and I will be alone again.” 

I didn’t have much time, so I flicked towards the end where she talked of a tall man coming to take her, but she vanquished him forever with the power of the book, and she gave instructions on how to do that. All it said was sign your name to the book and repeat what looked like a short prayer, at least I think it was, I couldn’t really understand it. 

I didn’t know what to make of it, any normal day I would have ignored it and got out of there as fast as I could, but that was not a normal day. Suddenly the whistling started again, it was coming from downstairs, I could hear something tearing along the ground, I started freaking out, and searched for a way out again but I couldn’t, I was trapped. 

Then I heard BANG, BANG, BANG, coming up the stairs, it sounded like whatever he was dragging behind him was big and heavy. I knew it would be only a matter of time before he got in there, the door was not in good shape after the last time.  

As he was walking down the hallway I finally gave in and tried to sign the book, but there was nothing there to write with. It was then I noticed there was a splinter sticking out of my ankle from falling through the floor, when I pulled it out it had blood on it. 

He was now outside the door, and I know he was angry, because he hit that door with such force that the hinges nearly came off with the first swing. Panicking I quickly signed my name with the blood that was dripping from my ankle. Then, BANG, one of the locks came flying off hitting the wall at the other side of the room.  

I didn’t really understand the words, but I did the best I could. He was still at the door, so I repeated it again. BANG, the final lock fell to the floor and the door swung partly opened.  

I just closed my eyes and repeated the words one more time, then I heard a thud, and there was silence again. I was terrified, expecting him to walk in that door at any moment, but he didn’t.  

Suddenly I heard, “Amber, Amber where are you?” coming from downstairs, it was Jane. 

I used that opportunity to get out of there, I was out that door and down that stairs in seconds, the front door was open, and Jane was standing there. I didn’t say anything I just kept on running, and Jane quickly followed me. 

It was only when I was free from the forest that I rested, by then Jane was in hysterics. She was terrified and had no idea what we were running from. Not wanting to make her any worse, I told her I got spooked by a rat walking on my feet. Besides, how could I tell her what really happened when I couldn’t make sense of it myself. It was only then I realized I was still holding the diary; I didn’t want to take that creepy thing home with me, so I threw it behind a dumpster at the garage near the edge of the forest. 

I was so freaked out I went straight home, I didn’t even care what my parents would say, I just needed to go somewhere I felt safe. As soon as my mother saw me, she knew I was drinking, she could immediately smell the vodka from my breath. My clothes were dirty and torn from running through the forest, God knows what she must have thought of me. 

Of course, she blamed Jane for everything that happened and banned me from ever seeing her again. When I tried to explain what really happened, she didn’t believe me, I’d say she thought I was on drugs, and sent me to my room. To be honest at that moment it was the only place I wanted to be, I just wanted to go to sleep, so I was relieved. 

I really thought it was over after that, but it wasn’t, something followed me home. As I was lying in bed, I began to hear a voice say, “get the book, it’s your only hope” over and over again, it was driving me mad. 

I barely slept that night over it, and even when I did, I got horrible visions, the thought of which I still can't bear thinking of. The next day didn’t get any better, I wasn’t sure if it was the hangover or not, but I didn’t feel right, I kept zoning out when anyone talked to me, and my memory was even worse, I didn’t even know what day it was half the time.

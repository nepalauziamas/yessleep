There were some interesting ideas in the comments on [the last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xp575a/how_to_survive_college_there_are_rules/)  It’s probably not going to be an idea you expect, either.  See, there were a couple people that thought that the laundry lady had been permanently and probably violently removed from campus (and life).  However, I’m not sure the timeline is right for that.  She visited my dorm room *after* ‘they’ found out about… whatever she’d done to upset them.  Her retaliation against me was for their retaliation against her.  Whatever punishment they meted out, it was already done.

Which meant she was still on campus.

And it meant that she still had a grudge.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

Granted, that grudge was primarily against me, but I felt pretty certain that she wasn’t able to act on it directly.  I mean, she’d already demonstrated the limits of that by showing up in my dorm room and threatening to harm my friends instead of me.

I wanted to find her.  Maybe she’d subscribe to the whole ‘enemy of my enemy is my friend’ thing.  Or at least be willing to have a conversation about wtf is going on around here.  And if nothing else, maybe I could use her as bait for the eyeball.

I started leaving my laundry in the dryer for longer than I should.  With it being the summer semester, there was little danger of it being dumped on the floor.  It took a lot of attempts.  I think I wasted a whole week - and a lot of money - washing my shirts one at a time.  On the upside, I was all over my schoolwork.  Had to do something with all that anxious energy, after all, and homework at least distracted me from the looming existential question of what the heck I’m going to major in.

(how am I supposed to know what I’m going to do with the rest of my life!?)

Then, finally, I went down to the laundry room and there she was.  My lone shirt was folded neatly, resting on her upturned palms.

“I… thought you said you couldn’t test me a second time,” I said tentatively, stepping into the laundry room.

“I’m folding your clothing because I cannot *stand* to wait idly by and pretend I don’t see it getting wrinkled as it sits there unattended in the dryer.”

She shoved my lone shirt into my arms and I struggled to take it without getting any closer to her than I absolutely had to you.

“This is a freebie,” she said icily.  “*You’re welcome*.”

She turned back to another dryer that had finished within seconds of me walking in.  She pulled out a handful of sports bras and got to work folding them.  I watched for a few seconds because I’ll be real, I didn’t know you could fold sports bras.  I just shove mine into the drawer in a wad.

Also I still find it creepy that she insists on folding literally everything, including the underwear.

“Have you seen… a new *thing* on campus?” I ventured.

“Nope,” she replied promptly.  “Everything is fine.”

“I think you know it’s not.”

She ignored me and kept folding.  She was finished with the rather impressive pile of bras and moved on to jeans.

“Oh come on,” I said.  “There’s a giant eyeball running around killing your kind!”Her lips thinned but she remained silent.  Fine.  If that was how it was going to be…

I shook my shirt out, crumpled it into a ball, and threw it on the floor.

She froze.  Her hands remained poised over the jeans in mid-fold.  Her gaze slid over to stare first at the shirt on the floor and then her eyes raised to meet mine.  I flinched at the hatred I saw in them.  This wasn’t even because I’d gotten her into trouble.  It was the hatred of a creature that had just been deeply, gravely insulted.

“Sorry,” I stammered, my nerve breaking instantly.  “I’m so sorry.  But I wanted your attention.”

“You have it now,” she replied quietly.

I told her that I knew she was in trouble.  I’d heard the flickering man talking about it.

“Self-important little sycophant,” she sniffed.  “Always meddling where he doesn’t belong.”

“Sorry,” I stammered.  “This is just… really weird to hear.”

“What, did you think we didn’t have hierarchies?”

“No it’s just - I mean, it’s inhuman gossip.  That’s weird, right?”  I took a deep breath.  Get to the point.  “I think - I have this thing - I have a weapon.  For the eyeball.”

“Why should I care?”

“Because.  I need help.  And if you want to get rid of the eyeball - if it’s the reason you can’t do whatever you want around here - then you should help me.”

“Well that’s bold.”

She turned away from me and resumed folding the jeans.  After a half minute of deeply uncomfortable silence I walked over and tried to refold my shirt.  It wasn’t nearly as neat as she’d done and she gave it a critical glance, but didn’t try to fix it.  I could only hope her lack of an answer wasn’t because I’d insulted her too gravely to ever recover from.

“I can take you to its lair,” she said in an undertone.  “After that, it’s up to you.”

“Okay,” I replied in a whisper.  “Thanks.  When…?”

“Now.  Go get your weapon.  We’ll go as soon as I’m done folding this.”

“Now?” I squeaked.

“I can hear your heart beating.  I smell your fear.  If I’m going to risk my existence - and believe me, this time they won’t let me live if they find out about this betrayal - then I don’t want to give you the chance to find a reason to back out.”

“I won’t!”

“But you want to.  Go.  Get.  The weapon.”

She wasn’t wrong.  I wanted more time.  Maybe I wouldn’t chicken out like she thought, but honestly… I can’t be certain.  Sometimes it’s better if you don’t think about it first.  If you just jump and sort it out once you’re already falling.  Still, I was panicking when I unlocked the door to my dorm.  It took me three tries because my hands were shaking.

Should I tell her I didn’t know how to use the weapon yet?  That we needed to wait until I figured it out?  No, she’d likely retract her bargain then.  I had a narrow window of opportunity here and if I faltered here, she wouldn’t be willing to back such a risky bet.  Besides, there was a downside to frantically studying to calm my nerves while waiting on the laundry lady.  I was not in danger of failing any of my classes.  I had no way to summon the devil.

Not that I think it would have done any good.  If he wanted me to know how to use the pencil, he surely would have told me already.  It was up to me to figure it out.

And believe me, I’ve tried every suggestion you all have given me.  Nothing has worked, at least, not in a way I’ve seen results.  I’ve written and written with it and nothing has changed, save that the pencil keeps getting shorter.  I’m saving the shavings in the bag with it, just in case I need them.  I kind of wonder if I need to use the pencil up, but I’m honestly terrified to try that.  I don’t think the devil will give me a replacement if I waste it.  I’ll have just failed my part of the bargain and as I write this I realize we never discussed what happens if I fail.

I don’t think he’d drag me to hell, that seems like a consequence he would have brought up to begin with.  He’d probably just make sure I flunk out instead and honestly that kind of feels worse than going to hell right now.

I stumbled back down the hallway to the laundry room.  On the way I passed a student who looked like he might be on the way there, so I frantically accosted him and told him that if someone had folded his laundry for him, to put it away as nicely as he found it.  I’m sure I made an impression on him, as freaked out as I was.

The laundry lady was waiting for me at the end of the hall.  She turned the corner and I jogged down the hallway to catch up.  We took the stairs down to the basement.  I realized as soon as we exited the stairwell where we were headed.

The steam tunnels.  The beast’s lair was accessible through the tunnels that didn’t always spit you out at where you thought they should.

“How far do we need to go?” I asked as I followed her down into the tunnels, the pipes hissing quietly around us.

“As far as we need to.”

I’m not sure why I expected anything less cryptic.  She led me on through the tunnels.  It felt like she was picking which way to turn on a whim and she probably was, knowing how these things work.  I was thoroughly lost in a very short amount of time.  We passed by a few doors and each time she walked right by without hesitation.  I had a bad feeling I knew where she was leading me to but I didn’t want to confirm my fears by asking.  She was right about how scared I was, after all.  I wanted to turn back.  I regretted my bargain with the devil.

I was finally mustering up the nerve to suggest an excuse to not go through with it when she grabbed hold of my wrist.  She broke into a run, dragging me along behind her.  I opened my mouth to ask what was happening, but then I heard the hissing in the pipes grow louder.  I knew *exactly* what was coming.

Steam was wafting at our feet.  It was coming.  The ghost in the tunnels was coming.

“Through here,” she hissed.

There was a door at the end of the corridor.  She wrenched it open and shoved me through without hesitation.  Then she stepped through and carefully pushed it closed, stopping just short of letting the latch fall into place.  She held the doorknob so that it wouldn’t release.

We were hiding from the steam ghost.  I sank into a crouch, my shaking legs unable to hold me up any longer.  We were in a dark place but from the cement beneath us, I assumed it was the basement of a building somewhere on campus.

“Cover your mouth,” she said, so softly I barely heard her.  “Try to breathe as little as possible.  You don’t want them to hear you before the steam dissipates.”

Them.  Not it.  *Them*.

Stupidly, I looked out into the darkness around us.

*Them*.

This wasn’t the basement of a building.  And we weren’t alone.

I silently clasped my hands over my mouth and nose.  I couldn’t see anything, but I could hear scuttling out there.  It was coming closer, pausing here and there.  Like rats, I thought.  Rats that were growing steadily bolder.  I took a slow, shallow breath and held it again.

The noises were all around us.  The soft scrape of something living on concrete.  The sound of their movement even came from above us and the hair on the back of my neck stood on end.  Cold sweat dripped down my back.

Something touched my knee.  It was a light touch, like the brush of a feather, but it was there.  It had touched me.

“Finally!” the laundry lady hissed.

And her bony hand clasped my wrist once more and she yanked me through the door and back into the steam tunnels.  Behind us came a cacophony of screeching, I saw in the light from the fluorescent lights an undulating mass of bodies, and then she slammed the door shut behind us.

The steam was gone.  The lady kicked at one of the pipes and it echoed hollowly through the corridor.

“I think we’re safe now,” she said grimly.

I wasn’t quite listening.  I was still staring at the door behind us, as if any moment it would burst open and all those eyes would roll over us in a hungry wave.

“What *were* those?” I gasped frantically.

“Oh, those?” She glanced back at the door.  “I have no idea.  The steam tunnels connect to all kinds of places.”

“So you just threw us into one without knowing anything about it?”

There was hysteria in my voice.  She sighed and in a tone that conveyed exactly how tedious it was to speak to me, she explained that she hid us in because she’d rather not encounter the steam ghost.  She was tired of dealing with it and that was worth the risk of the unknown on the other side of a door.

“Is it also a self-important sycophant?” I asked.

I don’t know what’s wrong with me.  I talk when I’m nervous I guess and apparently I try to use humor to diffuse the situation.  Except that doesn’t work too well when you’re stuck with an inhuman that’s the manifestation of every joyless husk of a human being you’ve ever known.

I feel I’ve gotten cheated.  My inhuman helper sucks.  Beau was at least cool, in that bad boy sort of way.  And when his appearance solidified, he was kind of hot.  I’ve got the Mother of All Karens here, She Who Speaks to the Manager.  Not quite the grouchy grandmother next door that thinks you play your music too loud, but certainly up there in the “shares Minions memes on Facebook” range.

“No, it just wants to hurt things,” she replied.  “We should keep moving.”

We didn’t have much further to go after that.  We passed one more door and then she swung the next one open.  As I feared, it opened to stairs descending into fog.  The lady stepped aside and gestured for me to enter.

“I’m not going down there,” I finally said.  “There’s nothing I can do about that - that hole in the world.  I’ve got a pencil, okay?  That’s it.”

“You have a *weapon*,” she corrected.  “I can feel it.  Given to you by an ancient thing.  I hate just being near it.”

Which struck me as odd, if this campus was ruled by an ancient thing.  Was I wrong about that?  It was so hard to tell.  It was like they were picking and choosing which rules to follow.  I said as much, hoping to get some more information, but more importantly - hoping to delay the moment I had to step through that doorway.

“You’re right about that,” she said.  “We don’t quite follow those rules here.  Makes that weapon you’re clutching all the more potent.  *We don’t want it* *here*.”

Her lips drew back from her teeth as she hissed her words.  I couldn’t help but remember how she said she’d skin my friends and I shuddered and hastily looked away.

Looked at the open doorway and the stairs leading down into the clouds.  That was a mistake.

“Let’s go,” she said grimly.  “Don’t forget this is a one-time offer of help I’m giving you.”

“And what am I supposed to do down there?” I protested.  “Okay, yes, fine, I have a weapon.  But that stairway ends way far up.”

“That’s why you still need my help.  I’ll get you safely into the creature’s lair.  I give my word.”

“You said you don’t follow the traditional rules,” I said accusingly.

She gave me a lopsided smile.  No, she corrected me.  They only follow *some* of the rules.  They hadn’t yet broken free of all of them.

“It’ll be up to you to figure out which ones I still follow,” she said, taking one step down into the open sky.

She held out a hand to me.  A hand left dry and cracked from years of handling hot fabric.  In that moment it didn’t matter how dangerous she was.  I was scared enough to accept the comfort it offered.  The promise of safety.  I needed any scrap of hope to step foot through that door, even if that hope turned out to be a mirage in the end.  Otherwise, I would have remained frozen there at the entrance, unable to bring myself to take a single step forward and see this through.

All of my determination was unraveled at the thought of that vast emptiness, of that ocean of water and that endless hole through the world.  The laundry lady was the only thing carrying me forward.

We’ve established that I talk like an idiot when I’m scared, right?

“I’m curious - why don’t you just go haunt a laundromat or something?” I babbled as we descended.

“Are you trying to talk to take your mind off how scared you are?”

“Yes.”

“Fine.  I’ll play along.  If nothing else, maybe it’ll make you smell less… *appetizing*.”

Her grip tightened on mine.  Her bony fingers hurt.

“There’s a lot of homesick students in the dorms and sometimes they appreciate what I do,” she said.  “Vengeance is nice… but gratitude is nicer.  I wouldn’t get that if I haunted a laundromat.”

She had a point.  But right as I was about to feel good about myself as a college student, she went and ruined it.

“All I’ve ever done is help you children out.  It’s not my fault that you’re wretched, ungrateful brats that were poorly raised by your parents.”

Then, like an idiot, I instinctively replied with, “okay boomer.”

I was nervous!  It just slipped out!

She immediately stopped talking, her lips pressed together into a thin line.  It didn’t matter.  We were at the bottom of the stairs.  The clouds hung just above our heads and all around us, the ocean lay flat and still like a mirror.  The hole was directly beneath us, a black stain, a perfect circle with the silver ring where the water cascaded over the edge.  My mouth went dry staring down at it.  Somehow, it was worse seeing it beneath us.  So much worse.  I clutched the laundry lady’s hand as tightly as I could.

“You said you’d get me safely into the lair,” I croaked.

“I did.”

“Is the lair like… in there?”

“No, I brought you here because I like the view,” she said scornfully.

I swallowed hard.  What now?  What was I supposed to do now?  What *could* I do now?  I hadn’t figured anything out and I hadn’t been able to stop Patricia or anyone else.  I felt so small and helpless, staring down into that abyss.

But I had a weapon from an ancient thing.

“Do I like… throw the pencil in?” I ventured.

“Well, you got part of that right.  You’re throwing *something* in.”

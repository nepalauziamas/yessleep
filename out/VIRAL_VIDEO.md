I was scrolling YouTube when I saw the channel pop up on my feed.  It said “Recommended for you” beneath a dark thumbnail image.  Something about it called out to me, and I clicked on it unthinkingly.  

A loud, baritone voice began to speak, filling my living room with sound.  Strangely, I can’t remember what it said, only the deep, entrancing way in which it spoke, and the insidious pain of it boring into my brain like the dentist's drill during a root canal.  

It was painful, but new and exciting.  It's hard to explain, but I suppose the sensation could be compared to eating spicy food or some other, less PG-13 activities. 

"Hurts so good," as they say. 

My head was swimming with endorphins and adrenaline, and all I wanted to do was watch the video again.

So I clicked the "replay" button.  

My head was buzzing afterwards, my ears ringing.  A warm trickle of something wet leaking from each side of my head and I raised my fingers to touch the dampness of blood running down my cheeks - both from my ears and my eyes.

I remember laughing then.  The reverberations of my demented chuckles ringing off the walls of my living room as I stared at the blank, black screen, and the replay button waiting to be clicked.  Begging for it.

My teeth hurt.  My knees were wobbling and my hands were shaking as I maneuvered the mouse to click on the elusive button to give me another fix, another hit, another bump of pain and power and…  

Something clinked as it hit the floor.  

The video was over again.

I looked down to see not one, but several of my teeth had fallen out without me noticing.  They sat on the floor staring up at me.

"Watch it again," my bloody molar said. 

"You know you want to," coaxed an incisor just next to it.  

I hit the button and the video began to play once more.  

And after that I must have watched it again.  Several dozen more times, in fact.  

When I opened my eyes and looked around I saw that it was morning.  Birds were making high, cheerful, chirping noises from just outside.

They would enjoy this too, I thought.  Everyone needs to see this.  

So I sent the link to everyone I knew, and then began moving furniture.  With an extension cord I hooked up the big TV outside on my front lawn.  

My eyes were tired and were closing involuntarily.  Blood was dripping from the holes where my teeth had been and was running from my ears and eyes.  I left footprints everywhere as I limped in and out, getting everything set up.

Finally it was done.  A small crowd of neighbors had gathered, seeing my bloody progress and wondering what I was up to.

"Watch," I said, hitting play.  "You're gonna love this."

I stood back and observed as their jaws dropped, their eyes glazing over as drool began to pour from their lips.  

It was the first time I had seen someone else watching it, and I realized upon seeing their reactions just how strange all of this was.  It hadn't occurred to me at all that something might be wrong with the video.  It just felt so good watching it that I wanted everyone to feel that pleasure.  

But now that I saw my friends and neighbours watching, I gradually became aware that something wasn’t right.  Something insidious was happening when people watched that YouTube clip, and it was doing something to their minds.  

Lazily, slowly, I began to move my arms, flexing my fingers and looking down at them.  I reached up and felt the gaps in my gums where teeth had previously been planted, and I screamed.  

A howling, guttural scream that caused babies to wake from their naps, and made them join me in my high-pitched release of terror.  

The neighbours around the television didn’t seem to notice, though.  They stared in fixed fascination at the screen, the zombie-glow on their faces exposing their drooling mouths and glazed-over eyes.  

All of a sudden, the video stopped playing.  It was over, and people were shaking their heads and looking around, as if coming out of a trance.  A trance that they desperately wanted to continue.

“AGAIN,” someone said firmly.  

“MORE,” said another.  

I began to stutter and try to speak, my words coming out uncertainly at first.  

“No,” I said.  “It’s bad.  There’s something wrong with it.”

I couldn’t articulate it any better than that, and went around to the back of the computer to unplug it.  

More neighbours were coming out of their houses, having heard my screaming and having seen the crowd forming.  They wandered over just as the small crowd began to turn on me.  

“He doesn’t want us to see,” someone muttered angrily.  

“He wants it for himself.”

“All for himself.”

The voices began to blend together in a growing rabble of noise as a dozen other people meandered over. 

A large man named Bill who lived two doors down from me suddenly jumped me and grabbed my wrist as I was unplugging wires.  He snapped my right index finger without warning, pulling it backwards until the bone snapped and shards poked out through the skin.  Blood spurted and gushed but he seemed not to care, only looking into my eyes as he continued to pull the finger backwards, further and further.  

“More.  I need more,” he said in a deep, angry voice, clenching his teeth and grinding them afterwards.   

I screamed again and those other neighbours joining the crowd began to protest, but then someone hit the play button again.  

The crowd, now double the original size, stood in fascinated awe, watching the video as it played.  Bill threw me to the ground and raced back to watch, like a little kid waking up early for Saturday morning cartoons.  He laughed with giddy excitement, then his jaw dropped and drool began to drip as he observed the screen once again.  His laughter turned to an imbecile, “Huh, huh, huh,” that reminded me of Steinbeck’s Lennie Small.

Despite my finger being broken, I knew I had to do something, and quickly.  If I didn’t, who knew how far this would go.  This video was like a parasite - it fed on human minds and didn’t let go.  It turned us into gibbering idiots, and if my missing teeth were any indication, it injured more than just our minds.  

That was when it occurred to me what I should do.  

While they were all standing there, entranced and captivated by the video, I ran inside my house.  My modem was hooked up there and that was the answer to the problem.  I would unplug it from the source and I would lock my doors and windows so no one could get inside.  

I took out my cell phone and called the police, dialing 9-1-1 with a trembling thumb, avoiding using my broken hand completely.  Putting it on speaker phone, I locked the door behind me and ran over to my modem.  

The emergency operator picked up and I told her simply that I had been assaulted - that a neighbour had broken my finger and I was barricaded inside my house.  I told her the man was outside, trying to get in, and that they should hurry. 

None of this was a complete lie, as soon enough I knew that the whole neighbourhood would be trying to get inside.  And the part about the assault was obviously true as well.  Still, I was a little nervous as I hung up the phone while the operator was mid sentence, telling me to stay on the line.  I felt as if I was breaking some rule by not listening to her, and an even worse rule by lying to her.  

Those concerns were forgotten moments later, though, as I unplugged the modem and people began to pound on the front door with angry fists.  Suddenly I had something much worse to be worried about.  

The door crashed in with the force of half a dozen men, enraged and red-faced with anger.  They swarmed me, spittle flying as they demanded with slurring voices that I fix it.  Whatever I had done, I needed to fix it.  

I refused, and the pain began immediately.  

One man threw my head against the wall - my body trailing behind with a delayed reaction that made my spine pop noisily out of place.  The drywall caved in under the weight of my skull, and I coughed out white dust and spit particles of paint as a horrible headache spread outwards from the top of my dome.  

Another man produced a knife from his pocket, and went quickly to my ear with it, beginning to hack with the smooth blade in quick, see-saw motions.  Blood spurted from my ear as I screamed and screamed, the other men restraining me, telling me over and over again, “FIX IT.  FIX IT.  FIX IT, NOW.”

More people were streaming in through the front door suddenly.  All of the neighbours were squeezing through the door frame with total disregard for their own safety - mashing their faces against the trim just to get through.  I heard ribs cracking and breaking, but saw no signs of pain as they began to press in all around me.  They raked their fingernails down my cheeks leaving bloody gashes, moaning and howling as if in pain.  

Eventually I relented and told them I would do as they asked.  I had no choice.  They would have killed me otherwise.  

I plugged the modem in again and told them to watch the video.  

The group of them raced outside, showing the same disregard for their own safety as before, if not more.  One man dove through the front window, shattering the glass, and the rest squeezed through the door in bunches.  

By now, everyone in the neighbourhood was out front, and the crowd which had formed was now a growing horde.  A hundred people or more stood gazing at the television and I muttered and moaned to myself, hating myself for what I had done.  

That was when the police car arrived.  

They called for backup, since more were there within a few minutes.  A dozen or so police officers wandered over to the scene, trying to make sense of what was happening.  

“What is all this?” they asked the crowd, as people blinked their eyes and looked around.  

The video had ended once again, and they were desperate for more.  

I was scared to go out front after what had happened.  I stayed inside like a coward, hoping the police would somehow solve the situation.  I banged on the glass window of my front door, screaming, and waving the police officers over, hoping they wouldn’t fall into the trap of looking.  

But that just isn’t human nature.  If one person stands on a busy street corner, looking up at the sky, as if seeing something of great interest, others will join him.  And maybe even a few cops will come to look as well.    

And that’s exactly what happened.  One of the cops walked over to the television set and looked at it.  The crowd was murmuring discontentedly and he seemed curious what could cause such a group to gather.  

I screamed out the window at him, telling him to stop.  But it was too late.  

Someone hit a button, and the video played again.  This time several people began to sway and lose balance.  Teeth fell from their mouths as their ears and eyes began to bleed.  A twisted sound of laughter rose up into the air and drowned out the baritone buzz of whoever was speaking on that video.  

*

I don’t know what to do.  I’m terrified of unplugging the modem again, even if I made a run for it, they would catch me.  They would torture me until I made it play for them again, and again, and again.  

There are hundreds of them out there now.  More are joining the crowd by the second.  Like a plague, the video is spreading, as between viewings everyone sends it to their friends and loved ones.  Their gap-toothed, smiling faces are so enthusiastic, so eager.  They just want others to see what they have seen.  

Have they sent you a link yet?

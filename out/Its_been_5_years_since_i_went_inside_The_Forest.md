TW: Mentions of death,blood, Su1c1de and, gore

It was a while back I had just finished my junior year of high school when my parents said I and some friends and some friends can go on a camping trip...  

DAY 1:  The day was like any other day when it started happening, We were eating some PB&J sandwiches when Brody brought up that he was hearing things and was seeing figures outside his tent he described it as a giant greater with long pointy fingers, he said it was about 7 feet tall, we weren't buying into it and said it was probably a squirrel or deer. But it did kind of put us on edge for the days to come

DAY 2: It started with the smell of rotten flesh, after checking around we found a squirrel's dismembered corpse in the shape of a pentagram on a stone, that's when we heard screaming as Brody was running towards us, but. it wasn't Brody, it looked like him, it spoke like him. but it wasn't him, this thing had deep never-ending eyes and no jaw, in horror John picked up a rock and bashed the things head in I looked inside and only found a deep void I didn't even see his skull, we went back into the site to pick up out things when we were Brody with a stick through his throat on a tree John three up then we left. We then ran until we found a new place in the forest.  

DAY 5: Everything was fine up until day 5 we started seeing things just like Brody did, until the night when John started stabbing himself with his hunting knife, I stared in horror as this happened it didn't seem like him but it was him I was scared I ran away looking for an exit in the interminable forest.

DAY 10: I ran and ran but I never found the exit I was looking around when I found Johns corpse with the words, "WE KNOW YOUR HERE LANDON" that's when I felt scared, I ran and ran until I eventually found the exit I ran and searched for our car and drove off to the police station, I tried explaining the story but they wouldn't believe it and eventually I was arrested for the murder of Brody Adams and John Green.

But he never left the forest...  


LOG 1:

We launched an investigation to find the two dead boys, going off on the suspect we checked the forest that's where we found Brody Adams stabbed into a tree, and John Green who had multiple stab wounds, that's when we saw our suspect Landon Whiyre with a gun next to his decomposed corpse, we looked as the analysis came in, two shots in the head created by himself, and a cut off arm we don't know where his arm went but we assume he ate it, we picked up a journal and read through it. We were in horror. We got a radio from the station that Landon started banging his head again and again on the walls,"But Landon's right here." I said in horror. We took all the bodies back to the station where we confirmed their body's and identity. Then we shot the other Landon dead.




Once again this whole story is fictional, do not feel alarmed or scared, and sorry if it may have triggered some fear in some

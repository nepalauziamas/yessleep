I keep waking up with cuts. I’m not talking about accidental scratches during sleep, or little abrasions that may easily be explained away.

I’m talking about cuts that bleed into the mattress. Deep gashes on my arms, legs, and torso. I was getting scarred all over, and I had no idea why.

I figured I was sleepwalking, and decided to chain myself up whenever I slept. But the next day, I was uncuffed from the bed, the rod on the bedframe I had cuffed myself to was broken, and there was a note on my desk.

*Please don’t ever do that again. Cuff us again and you very well might not wake up in the morning.*

The note chilled me to my bones. The content, of course, terrified me. But what made it inexplicable was that it was written in my handwriting.

As I stared at that note, frozen into place by a paralysing fear, a whole series of movies, TV shows and books began swirling through my mind. Was this like Memento? Moon Knight? Jekyll and Hyde? Was there an evil, violent side of me, just waiting to burst through? Did it escape whenever I slept?

I must have sat there for a good few minutes just staring into space, mind whirring, heart thumping heavily. The doorbell startled me back to action.

Paying the pizza guy absent-mindedly, I got back to my room and began munching on the pizza in bed. Not the most hygienic thing to do, but my mind wasn’t exactly in a good place. I began researching what I could do. There were lots of information online. It seemed that a lot more people were going through things like these than I would have expected.

First advice I followed was to set up a camera. Luckily, I had a pet camera. I had gotten it when I first moved here a couple of years ago, fully intending to adopt a dog for company. As it turned out, it was just one of those things that I just didn’t get around to doing. Part of me probably realised I was too broke to be able to take care of a dog, and too busy to be able to walk it every morning and night. I rummaged through the storage room, found it, plugged it in and set it up. I downloaded the application needed to view its video footage through my phone, set that up as well, then aimed the pet camera at my bed. Then I placed some random books, candles and knick knacks around it, hoping that it would make the camera less obvious. I gave myself a mental pat on the back for having purchased the pet camera with the night vision capability.

Then I realised that I would need to cover more ground. As much as possible, in fact. So I headed out to get a body cam and a couple of surveillance cameras. I also bought a black light and some cans of tonic water.

When I got back home, I hunted down the box of teeth whitener I remembered having bought ages ago. It took me a while to locate it in the storage room.

Then I mixed it with the tonic water, and wiped the mixture all over my shoes. I poured the remnant onto the mat outside my house. It should stay wet for at least a day. Just to be clear, I read that black light illuminates things like teeth whitener and tonic water, and I was hoping that the next day, I would be able to pick up my footprints using the black light and see where I went.

I set up the surveillance cameras in my living room, outside my house, and a little down the block, though for the one down the block, I couldn’t set it up on WiFi and so would have to manually retrieve it to view the footage the next day. I hid it as well as I could, and could only hope that no one would find it and steal it.

When I went home, I wrote on a piece of paper, in a large font, *Who are you, and what are you up to?*

I taped the paper right on the door, so whoever it was could see it before leaving the house. I also set up a portable reading lamp to shine directly onto the piece of paper.

I spent the day nervously messing around the house, trying to think of more things I could do to find out what was going on.

When night came, and I began to feel sleepy, I began to duct tape some magazines around my torso. I read that those were great for blocking knife attacks. I taped magazines around my forearms as well. Then, I clipped the body camera to my shirt, and sewed the wires to my shirt for good measure.

Next, I enabled the GPS on my phone and slid my phone, fully charged, into my pocket.

I settled down in bed. Despite the light from the desk lamp shining on the door, the discomfort of the duct taped magazines and my anxiety, I soon found myself lulled to sleep by a recording of a dog snoring. 

I woke up the next day with my vision half blocked by a piece of paper. I pulled the tape on it off my forehead, wincing at the sting.

I flipped the paper around and looked at it as my vision cleared, and saw the words, *Thanks for the ‘zines*.

I looked at my arm, and noticed that there was deep cut across the magazine I had wrapped around my left forearm, splitting the pages diagonally.

I sat up, and felt an intense pain spring through my shoulder. I must have strained it during the night. Remembering the setup from the day before, anticipation pierced my chest, dispersing the remaining fog of sleep from my mind.

I got off the bed, relieved to find that aside from the strained shoulder, everything else seemed relatively unharmed. I checked out the pet camera. It was untouched, which meant that whoever it was had come out of the bed last night had not noticed or cared to switch it off.

I swiped across the pages on my phone to the pet camera app. It didn’t take much scrolling before I found the footage I needed.

There it was, just half an hour after I had dozed off, based on when my snoring started. I felt a chill spilling down my spine as I watched the unfamiliar movements of my body. The video showed me sitting up in the middle of the night, looking around and checking my arms and torso, uncovering my shirt to examine the magazines. It was me, but the actions were strange. A little jerky and very hurried. They seemed the actions of someone much more brusque than I was, someone paranoid and intense. I watched as “I” nodded my head and smirked, seemingly approving of the magazines I had taped around my body. I watched as my body got out of bed, then walk to the door. Here, my body, or okay, I’m just going to call whoever was using my body, It. For clarity’s sake. So it stared at the paper on the door, then chuckled. It opened the door, not bothering to respond to my message. I couldn’t help but feel irked. Such inconsiderate behaviour, for someone who was borrowing my body in my sleep.

I activated the apps for the surveillance camera, and grabbed my black light. The footage showed me getting out of the house and head down the road. I walked out to grab the surveillance camera I had placed down the road, and rushed back to plug the camera into my computer. Once I had access to the footage, I quickly scrolled to the time it would have walked by. Around 1am. The footage showed it walking for a distance before turning left and disappearing out of the camera’s view. I scrolled further, and saw it returning from the same direction, at around 5.45am.

I used the black light to try to trace where it might have gone past that turning, but the visible traces of its footprints reached only a couple steps past the turn. Damn it. In future, I would have to somehow make a puddle of the teeth whitener/tonic water mixture at the turn.

Undeterred, I scrolled through the GPS locations of my phone. The GPS data confirmed what the camera footage had shown. I know it’s a little overkill, but I just wanted to make sure that it didn’t fake the GPS location data. Having different sources of information to cross-reference stuff was a habit I have had for a long time.

The GPS data showed that it had wandered off the road near the woods. Of course. I mean, where would a creepy body stealer go in the middle of the night? To the creepiest woods in town. Of course. I sighed, knowing that I wouldn’t be able to resist going to check out its route.

I pulled up the footage from the body cam. It showed my body walking down the path the other cameras had shown, though the first person view made the surrounding night seem scarier, more menacing. I scrolled forward, until the part where it entered the woods. I saw lots of trudging through the dense growth of the woods, and my hand reaching forward here and there to push leaves and branches aside, as if checking for something on the trees. I paused the footage and replayed a section, having caught sight of something. There it was, my hand pulling aside a branch to reveal a small spot of red paint (it was too bright to be dried blood) on a tree. Here and there, the camera view showed spots of red paint on trees at intermittent periods. It was probably a trail of markings meant to guide whoever was using my body somewhere.

Finally, the view changed. From the seemingly endless mass of green brown and grey, there emerged a tiny clearing, one that seemed unnaturally empty and hollow, scratched out in the midst of the lush growth of vegetation. It stopped for a while, staring at that patch of lifeless ground.

Then the camera view swivelled and its face appeared on the screen. My face.

“You shouldn’t see this,” it said, in my voice, but its intonation and rhythm made it sound like a completely different person. My gut twisted at the mix of familiarity and strangeness the voice held

The screen went dark.

I sat in silence, numb with dread. It knew I was watching, and it let me be. What was in the clearing? I had half a mind to stop pursuing things right there, to perhaps see a doctor, get some medication that could keep my body from moving at night. Perhaps this was all just me sleepwalking. Sleepwalking that led to an elaborate, complex series of actions There had to have been similar cases.

A quick search online quickly squashed my hopes. Sleepwalking could get really wild, like people waking up to find themselves driving somewhere in the middle of the night. But I found no instances of the sleepwalker being that aware of their surroundings, to the point of being able to seek out trail markers, realising that they are being recorded and leaving notes and messages for themselves to read or see while awake.

A huge part was also that I just couldn’t see it as just sleepwalking. It didn’t explain how I got out of my cuffs, how I got back to bed each time, and why I acted so differently on the footage.

I had to find out what was going on. I had to check out that clearing, get to the bottom of things.

I went home to stock up on things that I’d need. I re-taped magazines around my limbs and torso and tucked a Swiss army knife into my pocket (I didn’t have any cooler knives that could be easily carried around without attracting attention). I found my winter gloves and tucked them in my backpack. I found a mini garden shovel and a torchlight and packed them too. I recharged the body cam and scheduled an email to be sent to my only friend in this place, the only one I trusted, anyway. The user login and password to access the footage from the body cam was in that email. Just in case I didn’t get back by 10pm tonight, the email would be sent out and my friend would be able to know what happened to me.

I soon ran out of things to delay my journey. Reluctantly, I strapped on the backpack and clipped on the body cam, then headed out the door.

I soon reached the start of the woods where my body had entered last night. Despite playing the footage over and over again, it proved ridiculously difficult to trace the route that it had taken last night. After spending nearly 3 hours wandering around trying to follow the path shown on the footage, I was ready to give up. Then, I lifted a sagging branch and spotted a red paint mark on a tree.

My heart pumped with adrenaline. There it was. I was on track.

I took at least another hour for me to find the rest of the red paint marks that led me to the clearing.

Stepping into that small barren space, tentacles of dread twined their way up my spine. I knelt down to examine the ground, swiping about in sand and mud. There seemed to be nothing out of the ordinary. I pulled the mini shovel out and dug around for a bit. It seemed to be nothing but soil for the first few inches. I was beginning to think that perhaps there was nothing more to the clearing, when I heard it.

Some muffled cries, from beneath.

My throat constricted, and my heart began to pound. I began to dig in earnest, desperately shovelling up soil and mud. The cries became clearer. I was able to make out a few words, what sounded like, “No”, “leave me alone”, “help”. Around a metre down, my shovel hit something hard. I cleared the soil and mud away from the hard surface, and uncovered what looked like a trapdoor.

It was locked.

Staring at the mud-caked padlock, I wondered where the other me could have hidden a key. Considering how it was using my body, it had to have the key on me, in my room, or somewhere easily accessible. The footage didn’t show it retrieving any key, and I hadn’t found anything on me either. The key had to be around here. I looked around, unsure where to begin the search. I stared at the trapdoor, wondering if I could somehow break the lock and pry it open. That was when I noticed a faint outline of a key on the top left corner of the trapdoor. I ran my finger over the key shape. The key was fitted into the trapdoor, I realised. A near perfect fit, showing just the faintest traces of its seams.

I pulled out my Swiss army knife, and pried the key loose after a few tries. I listened to the continued cries from within, my gut brimming with fear. Trembling, I fumbled with the key for a full minute before I managed to insert it into the keyhole.

“No, please! No more! Please!” The voice kept wailing.

I took a deep breath, held the shovel in one hand, and turned the key in the lock. A loud click temporarily silenced the cries.

I reached out and placed one hand on the handle, braced myself, then pulled.

The trapdoor was heavy, but opened easily enough. It must have been opened recently.

I looked down to see a ladder.

The voice was loud and clear now. “Please, stop hurting me. Please just stop!”

I stared nervously down at the area lit by the square of light from the trapdoor entrance.

“Hello?” I called down.

“Just stop…” The voice rang out, followed by loud sobs.

Carefully, I stuck one leg down onto the first rung of the ladder. It held my weight. When nothing happened, I placed my other leg down to the next rung. Nothing happened, and the voice stopped.

I scurried down the rest of the ladder, and turned hurriedly to face the direction where the voice had come from. Holding the shovel out in one hand, I reached the other to the side of my backpack and pulled out the torchlight I had packed. I shone it around.

I froze when the round beam of light skimmed across a figure in the corner.

I pointed the light back at whatever it was that I had seen and steeled myself.

A dark figure crouched at the corner, huddled up and shaking.

I squinted, trying to make out its form and shape. It was a young man, dirtied, dishevelled, with clothes torn and stained with what seemed like patches of blood. His left eye was swelled shut, and there were cuts on his arms. He was tied up, chained to the wall. He looked up, and the haunted look in his eyes chilled my heart.

“Who are you?” I asked, a tremble in my voice.

“Just stop. No more games. Please, just let me go. Or kill me,” he said.

“Who are you? Who did this to you?” I asked, not daring to move any closer.

He stared at me, a desperate expression on his face. “Stop it, please.”

I took a tentative step forward, and he flinched, covering his head and leaning back against the wall.

“Stop what? What’s going on here? Who did this to you?” I asked.

He continued to cower away from me for a few seconds, then slowly lifted his head. He looked fearfully at the puzzlement and shock on my face, and seemed to study me for a few more moments.

“You aren’t playing games? You really don’t know what’s going on?” He asked timidly.

I nodded. He stared at me for a long moment, then spoke again. “You are not…Marlene?”

I frowned, confused. “Marlene? No. I’m Jodie.”

A look of understanding dawned on his face. “You’re Jodie. You’re the real person. The real owner of your body,” he said, hope beginning to fill his tone. He lunged toward me and stopped, constrained by the chains.

I took a few steps back, startled.

“You’ve got to save me. Please! Before Marlene comes back.” His tone was urgent, pleading.

“Who’s Marlene? Why are you here?” I asked, looking up at the entrance. There was a mania in his expression that scared me.

“Marlene…she’s the one who takes over your body. She took us all. She hurt us. She killed the others. Using your body. We…we didn’t recognise her at first,” he cried. “Please, let me go, free me. Please!”

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Why would she…why my body? What are you saying?” My mind was reeling in shock, unable to process much of what he was saying.

“You appeared before us a few days ago. You told us you needed help, your dog had fallen in hole in the woods. You lured us here. Knocked us out somehow. Trapped us. You told us you were Marlene. Back to get us. Using her body. Your body. Marlene’s spirit, she takes over your body…” His words tumbled forth like a torrent.

“That’s crazy,” I said, interrupting the flow of jumbled words. “You’re saying there’s a spirit called Marlene, who takes over my body? That she used my body to get you guys, whoever you are, to trap you here, that she killed other people? With my body?”

“Yes, she told us. We have never talked to you as you, only always as her, in your body.”

“Why would she want to do this to you? Why would she kill…the others with you? If what you said was true? And how would someone in my body be able to take down you and whomever else?” I asked, still incredulous.

“She seemed to have supernatural strength when she was the one in control. She killed my brother and my dad. She left me here, to torture me. She’s going to kill me. Please, let me go.”

The earnest terror in his voice got to me. I took a few hesitant steps forward, and saw the hope and anticipation rise within him.

I paused, just a few steps away.

“What are you waiting for?” He snapped, a touch of hysteria lacing his voice. I stepped back, shocked.

“I’m sorry,” he said, “I’m just so scared. Please, let me go. Save me.” His voice was soft and pleading.

I softened, and took a step closer to him. Then another.

“Why did she do this to you?” I asked, watching his face carefully. I saw a flicker of resentment and guilt cross his face.

“I don’t know. I have no idea. She’s insane. She’s dangerous. Please, just cut me free,” he begged.

I stared at him, and couldn't help but hesitate again. That was when he lunged at me. I stumbled back, narrowly avoiding his grasping hands.

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry! Please I just want you to set me free! I just really need you to save me!" His voice broke with emotion.

I stayed where I was. I was beginning to feel extremely uneasy. More so than I was already, anyway. Something seemed a little off about him. Maybe it was the way he spoke. Maybe it was his mannerisms, or his expressions. But I felt a sudden wave of mistrust towards him.

“What’s her full name?” I asked. I needed to know. I needed something to research. To find the truth.

He was silent.

“If you don’t tell me her full name, who she is, I’m leaving right now. And I’ll never come back here. Not as me,” I tried to steel my tone as much as possible, to convey my determination to him.

He stared at me, a tinge of hatred seeping into his face before he resumed a fearful expression. “Marlene Toa,” he spat out.

“T, O, A, yes?” He nodded. I nodded in response, and turned to leave.

“WAIT! You have to free me! Please!” He cried out, voice breaking with terror. I strode on, refusing to look back.

“Stop! Don’t leave me here! She’ll kill me!”

I climbed up the ladder, ignoring his screams. At the top, I turned, and said, “I’ll go check things out. If things make sense, if you’re… I don’t know, if you’re telling the truth, I’ll come back and free you. Just give me a while.”

“There won’t be time! She’d be back by night, please! Don’t do this!” I shut the trapdoor, muffling his voice.

Heart thudding, I began shovelling the soil back to hide the trapdoor. I checked the time. It was around half past 3 pm. Funny, it felt like days had gone by since I woke up this morning.

If I tried my best to stay awake, I probably had a full 15 to 20 hours to figure out a plan before I fell prey to sleep again.

I walked away from the muted cries, taking the trapdoor key with me. Marlene Toa. I needed to find out who she was. What happened to her. Why she took them, killed them, tortured him. Above all, why me[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)

 

A few days ago, I received a strange letter. It was signed by my friend David, but it wasn’t written on normal paper. It was written on a papyrus, but what really caught my attention was that it looked like it had been written in… blood.

Other than that, the letter just seemed to contain a creepy story with David as the main character, and its contents are as follows:

It was a morning just like any other. After waking up, I made myself a nice cup of tea and some cereal to go with it, and after that I headed out, completely unaware of the events that would transpire that day.

I had booked a train ride to a neighboring city that day for a music festival that was being held there, and to be honest, I was pretty excited to finally get on the train when it arrived. There was nothing unusual about it, just your good old, run of the mill train.

When I got on the train, I headed to my seat. There weren't many people on it, and those who were all seemed to be asleep, most likely due to how early in the morning it was. I sat down on my seat, and was soon greeted by an attendant, who checked my ticket and then handed me a cup of tea. 

“Thank you for traveling with the ę̵̂͐†̶͔͊ê̶̥͛r̵̹͒ñ̷͙͂ą̶̊̒l̴̼̀ train company” said the attendant with a smile, after which he moved on to the next passenger. 

“Hold on, wasn’t the name of the train company Elron? I must still be tired.”

Dismissing my thoughts, I proceeded to take a sip of the tea. As I did so, a rich, bitter taste filled my mouth. It was green tea, and it was of pretty high quality, considering that I purchased the cheapest train ticket I could get my hands on.

“Now that I think about it, these seats look way too good for the Economy class. I wonder if they had to change my vagon for some reason?”

“Well, whatever, it’s about an hour till we reach the city and I am feeling kinda tired, so I might as well make myself comfortable and take a nap.”

As I slowly drifted off into sleep, I could just about make out the sound of distant laughter.

I did not sleep well. In fact, my sleep was filled with nightmares. Nightmares unlike any I had ever before. I was running away from something, but I don’t know what. And no matter what I did, I couldn’t escape.  
Suddenly, I felt a hot liquid on my thigh, as I opened my eyes to find out that the tea had spilled onto my legs. Fortunately, it wasn’t burning hot anymore, so I didn’t get burned.

Checking my watch, I could see that an hour had passed. However, when I looked outside all I could see was an endless, dark forest, with slivers of moonlight sometimes making it through the branches all the way to the ground. However, soon a very thick fog surrounded the train, making the outside completely obscured.

“What the hell is going on, where the hell are w-”

“ooUGh”

My train of thought was soon interrupted by an inhumane sound from just behind the door. Then, the sliding door opened, and as all the people next to me seemed to be asleep, I kept my eyes just slightly open, so as not to alert whoever or *whatever* was beyond that door.

It seemed to be the attendant who had checked my ticket when I got on the train, and I was about to ask him what was going on and why the train hadn't arrived yet, but I’m glad I didn’t because what happened next will haunt me for the rest of my life.

The attendant’s head opened up to reveal endless rows of teeth covered in blood, with a large tongue licking them all over. The stench that came from it was enough to make me want  to vomit, but I somehow managed to stop myself. Then, *it* lowered itself onto the nearest passenger and started slowly but surely tearing through their flesh like it was butter.

Blood was dripping down its teeth as the passenger woke up and their blood curdling screams reverberated across the room as they struggled to free themselves from the monster’s gras. All this, accompanied by the steady sounds of flesh tearing, bones cracking and the monster smacking its lips in delight, not letting a single drop of blood go to waste.

I couldn’t bear to watch the scene unfolding before my eyes, but my survival instinct told me that I had to watch if I wanted to have the slightest chance of survival.

After a while, the screaming stopped, and soon, the monster had consumed the entirety of the passenger.

And then it had started eating the person next to the window. And whilst it was doing that, an idea struck me.

I had the only other seat next to the door, and the monster was now preoccupied with the passenger next to the window.

It was my only chance to escape, since if I didn’t run now I was going to be next. And I wasn’t going to let that happen.

I could vividly imagine those grotesque, misshapen teeth slowly tearing through both my flesh and sanity, and I sure as hell didn’t want to experience it for real. 

I checked once more that the creature was fully focused on eating the other passenger and then I quietly slipped out of the room. 

However, as I did that, the floor creaked beneath me, alerting the creature to my attempt at escape.  
I turned around and ran for it, expecting loud footsteps to follow me but… they never came.   
 

I ran and ran for at least ten minutes, crossing through the vagons until I finally stopped to catch my breath.

After catching my breath and looking around me I noticed an open door to my right. Checking out the room’s contents, I noticed my backpack on the ground. Suddenly, I felt a hand gripping my shoulder.

“Is there anything I can do for you, sir?”

I thought this must’ve all been just an elaborate prank by David, he enjoyed that kinda stuff. I called him to give him an earful for scaring me like that, but nobody picked up the phone. 

I decided to head over to his place to check up on him, getting on a train, as it was the fastest way to get there. 

But that ended up being my greatest mistake.

The letter was real.

I locked myself inside a toilet in hopes of avoiding the attendants but for the past five minutes, there’s been a monotone voice repeating the same sentence outside the door.  
“Sir, please show me your ticket.”  
This is it for me, I don’t have much time and I can feel its patience running thin.

So please, take my advice and avoid traveling by train at any cost!

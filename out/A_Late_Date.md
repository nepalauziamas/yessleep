And there I was. Waiting for a girl that would most certainly not show up. She was late  - 2 hours late, to be precise. She was one of my (favorite) co-workers at our job. Her name was Olivia, and I had only built the courage to ask her out yesterday. For my own surprise, she was quick to accept my invite and I was happy that she was giving me a chance, after two years of being "just friends". Olivia only agreed on going out with me if she was the one deciding were we would have our dinner.

However I must say that the choice for the place was...rather interesting. The front door was shut and I had to enter from a shady "backdoor", for whatever reason. There were barely any customers inside, except for an old couple and two lonely guys. The strong smell was probably due to the huge amount of cheap incense that was burning near the balcony. I sat down at a small table, waiting for Olivia. I checked the phone about 10 times but the last message she had sent me was from 6 hours ago, saying "I can't wait to see you." Well...at least she didn't reject my invite. That would be a lot worse, wouldn't it?

I was just about to leave, preparing myself to pay for the 2 glasses of beer I had drank, when she showed up. Her dress was absolutely astonishing. I've never seen her being dressed up like that. My heart could barely stand it, and so did my mind. She was gorgeous. She sat down, apologizing for the wait. She told me she had had an issue with her dress, almost like a silly excuse, but I didn't bother asking about it. I was happy she was there.

We talked for a while and shared lots of dreams and ambitions. She told me how she would like to become an entrepreneur and start a bussiness of her own. And so did I! We were getting along. Just before I started talking about my family, the waiter came, with the Menu in his hands.

Olivia had quite an interesting and...eccentric taste - at the very least - for food. Especially meat. While I had ordered a random meal and an expensive wine, waiting for her to pick the same, she smiled at me and said to the waiter, very calmly: "I want the speciality of the house, please." I didn't want to be rude, so I quickly changed my request, and orderer the same as the lady. What I found odd was that the Menu didn't mention any "Special Order". But well, I like surprises. What could even go wrong?

After about 10 minutes, the food came. The taste was, as I had mentioned previously, very eccentric. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It was...different. I never ate anything like that before. Sometimes it felt to much sweet, especially for a piece of meat. But I ate most of it. I didn't want to ruin the first date by being rude to her. We spent a long time talking about how she was planning to move to a bigger house and change her lifestyle a little bit. I loved the attitude.

Then, once we were finished, we left the restaurant. I paid the bill. It wasn't cheap, let's put it like that. We got in the car and I drove her home.

While I was driving, she wouldn't stop talking about how she enjoyed being with me and how beautifull the sky was during the night. I was feeling amazing. Suddently, absolutely out of nowhere, she leaned in for what I expected to be my ear, and kissed me gently on the neck. I was scared and very nervous. But I kept driving, without even answering besides smiling a little bit. She then said, very calmly:

"I know a spot in the woods. Mind driving there instead?"

I thought what any guy in my situation would think off. I instantly drove her to the place she asked me. I was getting lucky...

Once I stopped, in a very shady looking side road made of dirt, she told me to drive a little longer.

"There should be a small cabin around here." She said.

I was simply following instructions. I drove for a little longer until I found that said cabin. She told me to turn off the car and lights and wait there, just for 5 minutes. Then, she would be ready for me. I did as she asked me to. While I was checking my pockets to find the proper protection I was going to need, I dropped my phone by accident. When I picked it up, I saw a message. It was a message from Olivia. While I had no signal in the middle of the woods, I could only assume it was a text that she had sent me before or even during our dinner. It read as it follows:

"I'm sorry I couldn't show up today J. My brother had an accident, we're still at the hospital. I hope you don't get mad at me. We can still go out next week, right? <3"

Needless to say...I drove the hell out of there, without looking back.

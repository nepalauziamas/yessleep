Two weeks ago me and my friend were having a tickle tag tournament with one of my uncles, when all of a sudden my best friend stood up and put his finger over his mouth. He let out an audible "SHHH" and ran out of the room. I was weirded out, but me and the boys were on several hallucogenic drugs and opiates so I thought it wasn't that strange. Some time passed and while me and my uncle were playing hardcore "hide the sausage" my friend suddenly ran into the room and stabbed my uncle in the mouth. He then proceeded to roll around in my uncle's blood while yelling "IM SUSSY RIIIIICK / IM DICKIE DIIIIICK." I think this was a reference to a Fortnite character but I am unsure. After around half an hour of rolling around and screaming at the top of his lungs my best friend stood up again and yelled "OJISAN WAS NOT THE IMPOSTER. ONE IMPOSTER REMAINS." He then looked me dead in the eyes and calmly said "Answer the phone, David." My name is Matt but I know a guy named David but I don't think my best friend knew him. I refused to answer because that would be very "sussy" since I was named Matt and not David. I didn't want to look like the imposter, you see! He exclaimed "Well done Brett!" and flung himself out of the window. We lived on the first floor but he still died. I was taken into custody and accidentally incriminated myself multiple times over. After contacting my attorney at law Saul Lewdman I went about preparing my defense. It included, but was not limited to, "playing amonga." The judge cleared me of all charges, but ominously warned me that, AND I QOUTE, "One-a impasta remains." He was italian, you see. I then ran back home to find that my friend's body had disappeared, and in it's place was a ketchup knife with a single message: "You are the imposter!"

And then John was the imposter.

But I was Matt, not John. Who is John, anyway? Am I losing my mind here, I thought to myself. "No, no" I thought, "This must be the work of an enemy imposter." I set about to save my best friend from his own sussyness, and only one thing stood in my way. It was my own doubt in myself. I then decided not to bother with saving my friend since I didn't really like him anyway and the only reason I hung out with him is because he owned a PS4 and the Spider-Man game but now that Spider-Man has been ported to the PC I no longer have any use for him. It's been several years now and every once in a while I still think of my ex friend. Where is he now, who is he imposting then. And just then, I swear, I can, in the corner of my eye, I can see the outline of my nose because my nose is kinda big but I think it fits my face.

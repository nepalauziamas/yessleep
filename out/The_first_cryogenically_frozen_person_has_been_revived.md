The cryonics lab I work at calls itself an “ambulance to the future". The idea is if your body is broken and modern science can’t fix it, we freeze you until doctors in the future can. Dozens of wealthy individuals plagued with terminal illnesses pay decent sums of money to get stored in metal cylinders at our facility just outside the city limits. We specialize in full-body cryopreservation of humans and pets, as well as neuropreservation, meaning just the head. 

A patient in our care since the late 80’s, a wealthy man of an oil fortune who’d died of a heart attack, had specifically asked us to attempt his restoration on this date, what would be his 50th anniversary to his widow, regardless of the technology available or likeliness of success. We’d honored his wishes as we performed an initial controlled thaw using our patented procedure created to minimize cellular damage. He was then transferred to a plexiglass, tube-shaped coffin, dubbed the “thaw pod” and we flushed his system.

We successfully performed a reversal of our vitrification process (where we replace the blood with methanol, ethylene glycol and DMSO) and he soon was brought to an ideal body temperature. After stimulating his nervous system with a sequence of electro-rhythmic pulses we huddled around the oxygen-pumped, plexiglass tube he lay in, and then my jaw dropped as his eyes opened wide. Gasps and confused whispers were followed by clapping as we realized we had succeeded, despite the long odds.

We’d brought a man back from death. It was a first, and an astronomical leap in science met with popped champagne and cheers. We laughed and hugged and realized we were all going to be rich and written into history books worldwide. We then readied ourselves to find one of the three scenarios we’d prepared for:

Scenario 1 was that the body was technically alive, yet he was brain dead. The spiking graphs on our digital EEG’s, however, clearly showed an abundance of brain activity. My heart raced as I realized not only was he alive, but his mind was active.

Scenario 2 was the guest would return alive yet as a blank slate, his memory wiped like a formatted computer, or a newborn’s brain in a damaged, old casing. When he began mumbling what sounded like words, however, our excitement grew as we realized we were likely dealing with scenario 3.

Scenario 3 was the client returns with his memories intact, like he had simply woken up from a long, deep sleep. This was clearly the most desired outcome, and one we could have only prayed for, yet as he kept mouthing words from his plexiglass tube, we’d realized we had finally done it. We had brought someone back from stasis intact, a medical first that would change everything. Our excitement grew as he began breathing on his own. After an hour spent verifying he was stable, we were able to open the pod to welcome our guest to the future. 

As that lid slid ajar, we all listened as the hollow voice of the man within spilled out a stream of nonsensical words. My blood chilled at hearing that guttural babbling that sounded like gibberish from the 70-year-old man. His pale, wrinkled body was shivering on the cot as he driveled on in some language I didn't recognize. The six of us, who were huddled around the table, all jumped back as he bolted upright into a seated position and his stained teeth began chattering loudly. As I walked to the supply shelf to fetch a blanket, I heard an awful laughter bubbling up from behind me.

It was low and deranged, a laugh that sent my neck hairs rigid as my mind tried to comprehend what exactly I was listening to. I heard that mumbling continue over that sinister giggling. Our thawed man was somehow laughing and talking simultaneously, as if from two distinct sets of vocal cords. I then heard a loud crack, and spun around from the folded blankets to see the source of the sickening sound.

It was Bethany, the lab assistant. She had collapsed to her knees after the revived man had yanked her jaw clean off of her head, which he held in his bloody fist at the end of his frail arm. Echoing screams filled the facility as time seemed to slow the carnage I witnessed next. Those skinny, old legs moved quicker than I thought possible as he hopped out of the pod with a clicking grin. He moved like a pre-programmed machine, effortlessly yanking limbs from torsos with loud, suctioned pops from the helpless bodies of my screaming associates.

I saw things too horrible to fully process as time slowed from adrenaline flooding my body. Skulls of my coworkers collapsed inward, spilling their chunky contents, and bones were quickly stripped of their meat in seconds as the old man’s bony fingers worked. He tore through them faster than anything I'd ever seen, and all the while, his haunting giggling tittered on like some excited child. I scrambled away from the unfolding horror, narrowly escaping those clawing red fingers from that man’s scrawny, yet impossibly powerful arms. I fled from the strewn gore and agonized wails behind me as my heart raced.

My feet thudded down the bright hallway as I scrambled to barricade myself in a maintenance closet. I listened close over my pounding heart to the chilling screams cease with the nauseating crunches of bone just outside the door. The laughing grew louder over that muttering which sounded like someone speaking in tongues, like that thing was attempting some sinister mockery of religion. I slumped to the cold floor and tried slowing my heavy breathing to prevent being heard.

The exposed overhead bulb casts harsh shadows in the confined space of the closet. It smells like mildew from the mops, which is helping only slightly to mask the stench from torn entrails and the blood that now pools under the locked closet door. Just outside, that deranged giggling continues over that nonsensical gibbering. An occasional crack of bone causes me to flinch as I sit still, trying to remain silent. I realize now there’s a scenario 4 we couldn’t have possibly prepared for.

Scenario 4 is we brought something else back when we resuscitated that man's body. The hum of the forklift and the clangs of canisters being transported began not long ago. I trembled after hearing the familiar sounds of the thaw pod, fully realizing what’s occurring outside of this thin, wooden door. That thing out there is performing the thawing procedure on the rest of the bodies stored in those cryopreservation tanks.

 

I was walking from the company bus towards the long queue of security check which one has to undergo before getting in, listening my podcast in my wireless ear-pods. I was about to place my bag inside the CTX machine for screening, at that time, I noticed that my earpiece got disconnected,  it was unlikely for my earpiece to get disconnected because it had bluetooth 5.2 and and at that moment I realised that I didn't bring my phone with me, I had forgot my phone in the bus. In that moment of panic, I started to run in the opposite direction and crashed with one of the employees and without noticing his face or apologising to him, I rushed my way out as the security guard called me out.   


I knew that all buses will go inside the company  again to pick up the night shift employees and then come out again, so I waited outside the company for the bus to come, but it never came, I grew anxious and frustrated as time passed and spoke to the transport supervisor in the admin block, he asked me to go to the bus-shed on the other side of the road to get my phone. The bus shed was 2 kilometers away, but that wasn't a problem but that doesn't necessarily mean there isn't one, it was not any road to cross through, this was the highways. Highways don't have any traffic lights and it is a very rare occurence that the highways will  be devoid of traffic, this means I have to cross the road when the vehicles are going slow. I swallowed.   


It was a broad highway with eight lanes. On the sides of the highways were the service roads. I had to cross all the eight lanes at once, without stopping in between them. I let all the fast-moving traffic to get past me and now all the vehicles to the left of me were slow moving trucks, I decided to take my chance and cross the road, it was really easy compared to what I had imagined. I went to the bus shed and it looked like a ghost town with only buses and no drivers in them. I found my bus and went in, I usually sit in the last seat of the bus as it had a lot of leg room and me being tall, I found that to be the perfect seat to be in. I couldn't find my phone and I decided to search for the driver. I didn't know where the driver was so I went into the security there and asked me if he knew where the drivers went, he asked me to check inside.   


With nowhere to go, I went in and decieded to give a thorough search. But I couldn't find him anywhere in there. I scouted the entire place and noticed  sound coming from the side of the bus and I saw a person in there washing his hands, I asked him if he knew where the bus-driver was, he pointed me to a direction, the driver was having his breakfast under the bus to shield himself from the glaring sun. I went in and asked my phone. He gave it to me and I thanked him. I was famished from having to walk a long distance and that too without any breakfast under the sun. However I was a bit relieved having found my phone but thinking of crossing the highways made me sick again. I surveyed the highway and noticed that one side of the highway was still under construction, so it was basically a 4 lane highway in that place but it was also the mouth of the traffic. I decided to cross it throught the past since four lane highway traffic was better than the eight line highways.  


I crossed the highway with relative ease and now I had to get past the mouth of traffic in the service road, it was an easier thing to do, as the service road was comparaby narrower than the busy roads of the city. It had only 2 sides of traffic one from my front and other from the right. The vehicles from my front were few so I had to mind only the traffic at right. I saw that the right side road had a  lorry moving slowly towards me and effectively blocking all the vehicles behind it. I thought this was my chance to cross over and I did but what I didn't notice was there were also vehicles coming from behind, it wasn't a 2 way intersection, it was a three way intersection, a bike behind me had the same idea as me and ramped up his bike towards me running over me and fracturing my Fibula bone. I could hear my bones crack in my right leg and pain shoots toward my cerebellum, disorienting me. I felt the entire world going black and twisted, I couldn't think thorough and through the flashes I saw that the biker had passed in front of me and his face looked a bit familiar to me and before I came to my senses and, the lorry was near me and I tried to move but I couldn't move over a few inches,  the lorry driver pressed his brakes but it was already too late.

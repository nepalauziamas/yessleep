In 2010, a group of scientists, and Philosopher Baxter Harding joined together for an experiment named Project Revalations. 

Under Harding's ideals, the experiment aimed to suspend multiple volunteers into a temporary state of Rapture using sensory deprivation tanks and a solution named 'R' fed through IV. By doing this, they found they could place individuals into 'rapture' and then pull them back into reality for questions about Judgement day, the afterlife, and the secrets of immortality.

The team was funded by fanatical religious billionaires who lived prosperous lives. Still, they grew increasingly interested in extending their life beyond their expiry dates.

The first few individual tests proved somewhat successful. However, they soon hit a wall as subjects could only remember the first five minutes of the experience. Their brain activity on the EEGs would drop to zero. Subjects told the scientists that those five minutes felt like twenty and would also experience mental confusion for up to six minutes afterwards.

Subjects claimed they floated in silence. Some noticed a dot of light they couldn't reach, while others claimed they saw nothing. Harding and his benefactors became especially interested in the subjects that saw the light. The project's funding increased, and those who could not see the light were dropped from the program. The remaining three subjects, John, Chris, and Ino, were asked to swim toward the light.

It wasn't until a year later, when an apprentice put another subject under just minutes after the first one, that they discovered that the second consciousness could start where the first left off.

Following the discovery, they attempted the experiment with the same three people. Subjects would take turns swimming towards the light one after the other. After fifteen minutes, they found that the dot had only grown slightly bigger, and the final swimmer began to hear a low and bassy tone.

It isn't known how damaging the process was or its long-term effects on the subject's brains. But it was soon discovered that the subjects could go under multiple times while keeping the same three to six-minute rest period.

Harding came up with an idea. He proposed that the three subjects swap in and out of Rapture until they reached the end. One would enter while others would rest, and after five minutes, it would be the next person's turn. This meant that each subject had a ten-minute break before they were to enter again.

It wasn't something that could be done straight away. Although subjects only needed a short break, they found that even if their bodies were fit, they needed to be mentally strong to swim in the state of Rapture. This set the experiment back by months as the subjects were put on a specific diet and required to visit the facility multiple times a week and enter Rapture to train. Within three months, they extended the swim time between the three from fifteen to thirty and finally to forty-five. After six months, they got to one hundred and twenty. And after a whole year, they pushed it to one hundred and fifty. Where subjects claimed that they were 'close' to the light source.

Harding had decided that this was all the subjects needed, that they would push it to a total of one hundred and ninety-five on the day, and that the subjects would be able to do it if 'motivated'.

The subjects were instructed not to eat within twenty-four hours of their slots, and on arrival, they were greeted with envelopes of Harding's cold, hard 'motivation' before being strapped up and led to a tank. 

The experiment started off smoothly. The subjects would go under, recover, and then report back their process just minutes before it was their time to go again. Their ECGs, EEGs, and blood pressure never rose to anything of concern until one hundred and seventy minutes in. 

It was strange to see Subject One's heart speed up. His EEG showed increased activity in his brain, even a tiny amount during the blackout. I could tell by everyone else's faces that this was something new.

"Make a note of increased brain activity at one hundred and seventy-five minutes," Dr. Press spoke, "Standby for removal."

It wasn't until his recovery moments later that he radioed, demanding to speak to Harding.

I couldn't hear it well. Harding had put on headphones. Faintly, Subject One spoke in a panicked tone. I caught bits of sentences. Words like 'eyes', 'four angels', and 'seven' leaked through. But I watched on as Harding turned down the volume and took off the headphones.

"All is fine, continue." He reassured. Once again, Subject One entered Rapture. I observed his stats quietly.

"Subject One's heart rate is too high," Dr. Trinity Ford commented. I silently agreed.

When I had made the mistake of putting Subject Two into Rapture shortly after One over a year ago, I had thought that was the end of my time there. However, it was Dr. Ford that discovered my mistake was beneficial. I had been walking on eggshells since.

"It doesn't matter. Continue." Harding demanded. 

And what Harding and his 'friends' wanted, they got.

Everyone cared somewhat for the cause; however, many of the scientists there needed money and publication. 

The room was filled with a thick silence and anticipation. Everyone had waited for Subject Two to communicate finally, and when he did, they all seemed to hold their breaths.

"We were further back. I swear. We're so close..." Subject Two called breathlessly through the speakers. The waves of the tank were loud. I didn't think anything of it at the time. "We should be closer. Something is happening." 

This time Harding did not put the headphones on. Subject One's channel was the only one turned down.

"Just keep swimming, Subject Two. Report back any other abnormalities." Harding requested.

"Roger."

I excused myself from the room. The heavy and intense air felt all too much. The chance of failure when we worked on this for years weighed down viciously. If the project were a success, my name would be on one of the most revolutionary experiments in the world. This meant more jobs, more money, and even bragging rights.

I found myself in the room with the tanks, I hadn't intentionally set out to go there, but I think I subconsciously worried for John and Chris. 

A mass of wires fed through each pod, and the beeping of machines blanketed the room, but it wasn't until a few minutes after I settled on one of the chairs that the faint sound of scratching caught my attention.

I couldn't pinpoint it at first. It would stop occasionally and sometimes start back under the disguise of the beeping.

The pods were thick, designed to completely block the outside world out for those inside. And in return, it made it extremely difficult to hear the subjects. Sensory deprivation has always interested me. I was tempted to take one of the pods for a spin without compound 'R'.

I had made it over to Subject One's pod and found the source of the scratching. He said something, but the pod muffled his word. I caught a few things such as 'scroll' and 'lamb'.

Screaming erupted from pod one; it scared me into shock. I stood frozen for moments, listening to the screeching and scratching. I had witnessed the scientists open and close those things multiple times, but with no visible handles or locks, my brain frazzled under pressure.

"John?" I called out. He returned nothing short of an expression of pure fear. "John. I'll get you out... Just calm-"

"Do not touch the tank, Mr. Sullivian." I jumped. 

"Subject One is experiencing paranoia. They all are," Harding's voice sent ice through my veins. I almost felt like a child getting caught doing something he shouldn't. 

"This is the longest they have been under. Previous tests have resulted in the same results after an extended time. It takes a lot of mental strength."

Tank One grew quiet again except for the slight scratching. He most likely had entered Rapture again.

"If you want, you can stay here and try and talk to them or come back to the observation room. I think we'd do much better with you in the room." 

It didn't feel like much of a choice. Harding had a strange aura of authority to him. I felt like I had to please him. Since I was just an apprentice, it felt like I didn't know as much as him or the other scientists.

I followed Harding back into the room. The atmosphere felt a lot heavier than when I left. The other apprentice was viciously writing down notes spat at him by Dr. Press.

"We're definitely making less progress. Someone is swimming back. I keep entering facing the wrong way. I was so damn close." Subject Two's voice filled the room. He sounded annoyed. If something was disrupting the experiment, it could mean more time swimming for them.

"We need to speak to Subject One, Dr. Harding." Dr. Ford suggested.

"Subject One has requested radio silence. I do not want to affect his mental state." 

"I understand that, Dr. Harding, but if he's purposefully sabotaging the experiment, we need to find out why." 

"Subject One is fine, is he not, Mr. Sullivian? He has just visited the pods." 

I should have said something. I moved my gaze from Dr. Trinity and back to the monitors.

"Yeah. He's fine."

Dr. Trinity glanced at Subject One's stats. I could tell that she wanted to mention them and how they weren't normal compared to everything else we had seen.

"The subjects are experiencing paranoia. Just like they have done previously during limit testing." Harding reassured. He made sense as the three subjects had to train to stay in that state. But there was no explanation for everything new that had happened.

"Hello?" Subject Three's voice rang,

"Subject Three, how are you doing?" One of the doctors responded.

"Oh god..." His voice was shaky and breathy. "I was about to touch it, but... Fuck."

I had assumed we were further away.

"We need to abort. P-Pull John out." Despite the water surrounding him, his voice was dry.

"Subject One is already under. Subject Three, you need to breathe."

"Oh god... We're-"

The radio fizzed and hissed as Subject Three's broken words spluttered through incoherently. Subject Two's ECGs and EEGS began to blare warning signs as his heart rate, and brain activity dropped and rose rapidly. 

"Pull him out!" Harding screamed. I watched as two of the scientists scuttled out of the room. Subject Two's vitals fell flat moments later.

"Subject Three, do you hear me? Subject Three!"

I shuffled past the now standing group of people and out of the door, just in time to see the two scientists helping Ino out of the pod.

"Is he okay?" I asked in a panic. The two seemed relaxed while Ino smirked and mumbled words along the lines of '...in the light'. 

"Yeah. His machines failed. His stats are fine." 

I let out a sigh of relief and watched them wrap a towel around him and lead the clearly exhausted subject to the resting bay.

I was left alone.

John's pod was quiet. There was no scratching or screaming—just silence. 

I was relieved, but I couldn't shake off the slight concern I had. John wasn't a friend, but he was one of the only people involved that cared to ask how I was doing. He was a nice guy and had told me he was doing this so he could pay off his student loans. I thought that maybe I would get this phone number after the experiment, and we could be friends.

As if on cue, the two scientists returned. They were slightly damper than they were just moments ago. One spoke into his radio and asked for permission to let John out. Harding's voice rung through, and I watched him pop open the tank.

The first thing I caught sight of was John's smiling face. The two corners of his lips stretched up and almost entirely across his face as if in complete ecstasy. His skin folded around the tips of his lips, and the skin appeared to be rubber. I had thought the prolonged exposure to saltwater caused it, but it looked too synthetic.

The two scientists, already gloved up, helped a passive John out of the pod. The water was a deep red, yet John had no visible injuries. He struggled to stand as if he were a baby, learning to use his two feet. The smell of rusted metal filled the room quickly, and the red liquid splashed across the floor and onto my shoes.

Across his body were seven blisters, all ready to pop. They weren't seeping or cracking and clearly weren't the cause of the red water.

The two scientists spoke quietly to each other, and both showed concern and fear over the blisters.

"What happened to him? Is it an allergic reaction?" I asked. The two looked at each other, John, and then at the water. One mumbled something along the lines of not being sure and to ask Harding or Press.

"John. Are you okay?" I asked. The blisters looked incredibly painful.

His face slowly turned to me, and his head tipped to the side, his neck too weak to hold its weight. I had thought I heard it crack. 

Red droplets fell from his hair and down his cheeks. Some entered his mouth and stained his teeth, but it did not bother him. His eyes were dim, as if he wasn't really there, but his EEG showed more than average activity. 

John stared at me for what felt like minutes.

He gurgled something. The water made it difficult for him to say anything. I didn't have time to say much more as the two scientists carefully wrapped him in a towel and led him to the resting bay. Just as they turned the corner, John stumbled and hit one of the blisters off the wall. It burst and stained the area with a strange black goo. The scientists led him away, leaving the sludge to slink down the wall.

I glanced back to the pod. Faint scratch marks covered every visible piece of plastic inside it. Most of it had been on the lid. I wondered what John saw in his paranoia. I didn't look at his hands, but he must have had some strong nails to cause the damage he did.

Harding returned to the room, followed by Dr. Trinity and Dr. Press.

"What is that?" Asked Dr. Press. Harding simply walked towards the pod. Cautious of the red splodges on the floor. Voices mumbled in worry and concern.

"Why is it all sevens?" Trinity questioned. Baffled by the scene in front of her.

"Interesting." Harding leaned over the tank, swiped his finger over some of the scratches and then glanced over to Subject Two's pod. He didn't say much. Perhaps he expected it or was mulling it over. 

"It's time to pull out Subject Three. Where are Dr. Jones and Dr. Morris?" 

"They took Subject One to the resting bay," I informed him. 

It was only for a flash, but I swore he looked concerned. 

"Alright. Dr. Press, Dr. Trinity, come with me. Mr. Sullivian, assist Subject three."

When I finally opened the pod, I was relieved to be greeted by clear water. It was apparent that Subject Two and Three hadn't experienced such extreme paranoia as Subject One.

"Careful does it." I guided Chris out of the pod. He pressed all of his weight onto me, soaking my clothes with salt water, and I stumbled under him, struggling to keep him up. 

"How are you feeling?" I asked

Chris's breaths were unsteady, and he refused to speak. His hands formed into fists, and he pushed back and away from me.

Chris screamed like an injured animal. His voice cracked and echoed throughout the room. He stumbled back and caught himself on the edge of the pod. I watched as he used it for support. 

"What happened?" I asked and handed him a towel, which he took but didn't bother drying himself. 

I watched in shock and silence as he tried to find the words. At first, he stumbled over himself as his mouth earned to find the right words.

"The light," he began, "I thought it was weird... But I ignored it. There was something in the fucking light. Something smiling."

Chris brought his shaky hands to his face and began to sob uncontrollably, his tears and snot mixed with the saltwater which covered his body. He swiped the towel across his face aggressively.

"I saw the face around one hundred and sixty minutes in," He breathed heavily. "I just thought I was going crazy..." I placed my hand on his wet shoulder, a gesture of reassurance. His skin felt strangely soft. "But just before I touched it. I saw them. Angels... With animal heads. A lamb with seven eyes and a scroll with seven seals." 

Chris rubbed his face with the towel again, this time harsher than the last. I couldn't begin to comprehend what he meant. I'm sure it made sense in his head.

It wasn't until then that I realised I was yet to see his face.

I imagined him with the same disturbing grin that John wore, and at that point, I grew terrified of the man in front of him.

I watched nervously as he rubbed his face with the towel yet again.

"The seven seals." He spoke up again. I looked down at the towel, scared to see blood, and was relieved to see it was the same white colour as previously. "If- If John made contact, he'd know where they are. Where is he?"

"The resting bay. He wasn't really talking."

Chris pushed himself up, and I finally saw his face. It was red, perhaps friction burnt, but thankfully there was no unusual grin there. 

As he took heavy steps toward the resting bay, I watched small puddles of water form on the floor behind him. He swayed side to side at points and almost collided with the goo on the door frame. He stopped and stared at the liquid, confused. It wasn't until then that I decided to follow him. I stayed a bit behind him, ready to support him if his exhausted body fell.

Chris opened the door. It scraped against the ground. The hinges had dropped over the years, yet it was never fixed.

"Shit..." Chris hissed.

I forced myself to look around the room's insides, my eyes only ever staying on something for a millisecond.

"What- What the fuck?" He continued.

I held my breath in fear that I'd throw up my dinner if I dared to breathe. 

Familiar bodies lay across the floor, bloodied and naked. I turned away. It didn't feel real. I partially felt numb, however, nausea came and went in unexpected waves. 

Chris took a step in, a brave motion that I would never be able to do.

"He's not here."

I turned around and scanned the room yet again. The two scientists from earlier, Ido, Press, Harding and Trinity's bodies littered the floor. 

But there was no sign of John.

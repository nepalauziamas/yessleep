After my grandfather passed away a couple of years ago. My parents ended up in court, which resulted in their divorce.

I was 17 years old at the time. and I've never figured out why it happened. They were highly attracted and very loving to each other, and I'd never seen them argue in my life. Not even once.

My [father](https://imgur.com/a/reFysKc) was a farmer and a nice guy. He was a giant of a man with a massive mustache.

My [mother](https://imgur.com/a/VLZ6AU5), on the other hand, is a total badass. Don't get me wrong: she's a wonderful lady who is also a badass. I'm not sure what it is about her that makes her so terrifying in a lovely and cute sense.

Eventually, me and my little sister moved out of the house with my mother, leaving our dad. We couldn't help but rent a very expensive apartment for the time. We couldn't find a better deal anywhere else.

My father used to call me all the time and beg me to come visit him, but I never did. I was disappointed in him for leaving his family alone in the freezing weather of Yukon. Knowing that he could have helped us in some way. However, he did not. My mother and I both worked full-time jobs so we can pay the rent and put food on the table. However, sometimes we couldn't afford to buy groceries for dinner, which was one of our biggest problems. We were saving every penny... It was a rough time, but I always remembered the saying, "Hard times create strong men." And It kept me going for a while.

I'm okay with not eating for a couple of days because I've gotten used to it, but not for my little sister. I usually buy cheap meals from McDonald's for her. Although it's not healthy, I can't let my little sister go hungry. My mother was working 12 hours a day, making it difficult for her to care for my 9-year-old sister. So I had to get my ass up and do something.

Fast forward a couple of years. Things changed a bit for the better. I finally got a promotion, which helped us a lot. We still lived like shit, but I was thankful. I told my mom, and she cheered up, knowing that she could work fewer hours now. Slowly, things have begun to improve for us. The other day, I got home from work at 10:16 p.m. My mom and sister were sleeping. I didn't want to wake them up, so I walked slowly, and as soon as I entered my room, my phone started ringing, with a very loud volume.

"Who is this?" My mom asked, intimidatingly close behind me.

It is almost as if she spawned behind me. She was sleeping when I opened the door, and now she is behind me. I was puzzled.

"It's my father," I said quietly, after catching my breath.

She gave me a long look before leaving the room. Aside from my mother acting weird. I was curious as to why he was calling at this hour, so I answered the phone for the first time in a while.

"Hey."

"Howdy, big guy! Did you miss me? Because I did!" He said.

"What do you want, dad?"

"Your voice changed a lot, big man! I bet you've grown a mustache!"

"I'm going to hang up."

"Wait, wait! In all honesty... there's something that belongs to you and your mom that I can't leave here with me. I want you to come here and take it. "

"Dad, what the heck? After all we've been through, now you are giving us free stuff? We are fine, thank you." "Actually, Wait, what is it though?" I asked, as my curiosity got the best of me...

"It's your mom's old closet. I bought a big wardrobe and I don't need it anymore. Come take it before I break it into pieces,"

"A closet? really? o-okay. Will do tomorrow."

"That's my big man!"

I hung up.

A closet... seriously, what's wrong with them now? I didn't want to go back to our old house because of the stupid closet. I don't care if he destroys it. I wanted to go talk to him about what had happened between him and my mother. since my mom didn't want to talk about it at all. 

I needed answers. 

&#x200B;

The next day, I asked a coworker of mine to lend me his truck, and he agreed. Before I arrived at our old house, I called my father to let him know I was coming. I could hear his giggles over the phone and felt happy for him for a moment.

After a while I reached my destination. And as I walked to the front door, I kept smelling a weird smell, like something was burning. I ignored it and rang the door bell. No one answered the door. I rang the doorbell again, and still, he didn't answer.

"Didn't I just called him and he said he was home?"

I went to the back door and, surprisingly, it was open. The house was dark and cold, as if no one had been living in it for weeks. I was getting nervous and feeling a sense of nostalgia after seeing my old home after years.

And that's when I saw it; The closet he was talking about. I had no idea what made it so unique. It was simply an average closet. A medium-sized one.

Now that I think about it, I've never opened it, never looked inside it, and never used it because it was always in my parents' room. However somehow, It was heavy, like really heavy. I couldn't lift it on my own without breaking my back. So I called his number. After all, I came to talk to him in the first place.

A ringtone played inside the closet.

"Wait.. what?"

I hung up and called his number again to make sure, and it started ringing inside the closet again.

"Why did he put his phone in the closet?" "What happened to him? Dad, are you inside?" I got nervous.

"You just called me yesterday, and now your phone is in this... closet?"

I tried to open it, but I couldn't. It was locked with a key. I hurriedly searched for the key because I thought my father was trapped inside. I ran inside all our rooms, searching for the key, and then started thinking about it.

"Wait, hold up. This doesn't make any sense. He is a gigantic man. He couldn't fit inside! That's impossible! The size of the closet barely reaches half of his size! " I called him again, only this time, someone picked up the phone.

"Dad! Are you okay? " I screamed into the phone.

All I could hear was someone whispering into the phone. It sounded like someone was speaking quietly into the phone, like some sort of spell or religious phrases.

"Dad! Where are you? " I screamed into the phone again.

While I was moving the phone from place to place to get a better signal, the whispering was still there, and once I placed the phone on top of the closet, the whispering stopped. That's when I knew I was done.

I then heard it. There were footsteps close behind me. I turned around as quickly as I could and saw my father, who was dressed formally in a suit and tie.

"What the hell is wrong with you?" I yelled at him.

He stood there, staring into the closet as if I weren't even there. For a brief moment, his gaze was fixed on it, and he stood stiff as a rock.

"Dad?" "Dad, what's going on?"I thought you died!"

Suddenly, he shoved me aside and went to the closet, where he used a key to open it. When he opened the closet door, a bright red light emitted from it. He then walked into it, squeezing himself into the tiny closet that was his half size. I could literally hear his bones cracking while he was squishing inside, but his face didn't move at all, he didn't show any sort of pain, he was like a robot.

I stood there, frozen in fear. I couldn't even move.

"What... are you doing?" I asked in a complete shock.

Before I could react. He was somehow swallowed by the closet and the door was closed again. Some of his body parts were on the floor, and there was a lot of blood all over the place... I had no idea what to do. I couldn't look at the ground or his... body parts. This entire bizarre scenario was new to me. And I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

My phone started ringing again. And before I could look to see who was calling, I dashed outside before anything else bad happened. I looked at the phone and it was my father's number. I hesitated before picking up the phone, but eventually I did.

There was silence on the other end for some time, but eventually the whispering started again. As I was listening closely, the call stopped. I think it because he was out of credit. I immediately dashed inside the car and went to my mom's workplace.

I was speeding, not caring if the police noticed. With watery eyes and shaking arms, I almost had an accident but ended up reaching my mom's workplace safe.

It was a big building. with a lot of guards and police all around. I went ahead and asked the guard at the door for permission, but he did not allow me to enter. The building was secured for some reason, and no one else but the workers was allowed inside.

"Please. Look, I need to go inside. My mom works here. It's an emergency. I need to talk to her. Here I can give you anything... "

"Woah woah slowed down lil fella! If you sure it's an emergency, then go ahead, man. make it fast tho. I ain't looking for any trouble today, aight? Are we clear?"

"Yea! Yeh, thank you, thank you. "

As I went inside, I asked the secretary where my mom's was at. And she asked me for a card first. I tried explaining it to her, but she didn't buy it. As she was about to send me out, I saw my mom. She noticed me and asked me why I was here.

"What's going on sweetie?"

"We need to talk." I replied.

We went to an empty hall and sat on the chairs there.

"What's wrong?"

"My father is dead." I blurted it out.

"What!?"

"He-he was swallowed by that closet in our old house, mom! Remember how he called me the other day? He asked me to bring that annoying closet. When I got there, he began acting strangely... He squeezed himself into the closet and..."

"Don't say anything else." She said. with assurance.

I nodded.

"You shouldn't be so sad. We are alive, and we have each other. I will always be here for you. That's what matters. "

"What do you mean? His life matters! For fuck sake, stop being fake and STOP FUKING LYING TO ME FOR ONCE! I need you to explain to me what happened. Or I'm going to get there. and find out for myself. "

"Okay, listen carefully, remember, you asked."

"That closet was a gift from your grandfather. I'm sure you've heard good stories about him. I'm here to crush you with the truth. Your grandfather was a killer, a serial killer, and he killed many people in the past. He was a very powerful sorcerer who lured young girls and women to his house, where he would kill them and use their hearts to power his magic. He would kill those women and then eat their hearts. He also had a bunch of magical stuff along side his, closet. It could suck anyone in and they wouldn't return until he wanted them too. He gave us that closet to keep us married for many more years. "

"What do you mean by "keep us married"? " I asked.

"I never loved your dad. You know how it is when you get older, right? Society teaches us to marry young and for the sake of having children, but I wasn't ready yet to settle down. My parents already had me when I was twenty, so I didn't want to rush things. But I didn't have much of a choice. and then made a huge mistake by marrying him. Your grandfather gave me that closet so that when you get to your twenties, one of us can kill you and put you in the closet, and we can be 20 again. you are not even my son. And I never wanted you or your little sister. That's the truth, and you asked for it. So there it is. "

"You are...a b\*\*ch... "I murmured in complete astonishment.

"Honey, Don't be sad. You asked me, remember? Ah God! It stinks that your father died today. We can't complete the operation and I'm going to be stuck in this body for ever now."

"You... goddamn piece of shit." I said, as I was trying to get my shit together.

"I know that's a lot to take in, but you had to know. Oh, also, your sister is going to die. Probably... today."

"How... do you... know that?"

"It's because of your father. A daughter to a father and a son to a mother. That's what your grandparents used to say. "

I rushed out of the building as quickly as I could, infuriated at the whole thing. The police were outside, along with the truck I used to get here. I knew that they were looking for me because I had been speeding before.

"What should I do? God! Why is this happening to me now?"

Just then. The security guard came to me.

"look man... I didn't do anything it was just an emergency I swear."

"Yo kiddo, need a ride?" the guard asked me.

"What? Y-y-yes please!"

"Come on, get in! what yo name?"

"Um, Dio! my name is Dio. What about you?"

"I'm Jacob."

"Why are you helping me, man?" I asked him.

"I dunno brotha, you seemed genuine about this shit ya know?" I ain't letting no PoPo get in da way. I was thinking, bro. He ain't no troublemaker, you know. I did a lot of shit growing up. I ain't gonna let you cross the path I crossed years ago."

although I couldn't understand exactly what he meant, I appreciated his help and thanked him for everything.

I went inside my mom's room, where I found my sister crying. I sat next to her, asking her why she was crying.

She said that my mom was going to kill her tonight.

That's when, I decided I'm gonna end my mom's life today. it's me or her.

As I'm writing this, I'm sitting in a car with Jacob. Holding a shotgun. Waiting for what we humans call "mom" to end her shift and get out of the building.

I'm going to commit a murder. I'm going to put a stop to this. Once and for all.

I feel a grumble in my stomach so I go to get some food, specifically either instant ramen or some microwavable meals. But as I get to the pantry there is no ramen in there so I go to the fridge and I open it “huh”,” I guess we're all out of food”. I could probably last another day but I didn't want to starve my little kitten. So I got up and left my house as I was walking out of my small apartment. I was startled as I realized I almost left my phone. I ran back in and grabbed my phone and said goodbye to my kitten. I'm in a kind of rush so fly down the stairs but as I'm running down the stairs I missed the last couple of stairs on the story so I fall and trip and hit my back on the wall, I don't remember much but I remember this shadowy figure running down the stairs and as head stopped spinning and my head stopped spinning and I regained my vision, all I saw was the most beautiful person I had ever seen. She helped me up and said,” are you okay?”

I know it sounds stupid but it's almost like I didn't know how to respond, so the only things I could get out of my mouth were “thanks”

She laughed and I did too and she asked me for my number but before I could grab my phone out of my pocket and give it to her she was already walking away and I watched her go into her apartment on the floor I fell but before I was about to go run-up to her I remembered that I still had to get me and my kitten some food. She always loved the bacon-flavored ones so I finally got up and walked out and started walking down to the supermarket. I get to the cat food section I couldn't find the bacon-flavored so I just grabbed a random one and as I'm checking out the cashier said: “you have a new cat I see.”

Very confusingly I replied “nope still the same one.'' She looked at me confused but didn't reply. I walked out of the store with a pretty much empty bag except for three or four cans of cat food. The market is pretty close to the apartment because it is not much of a hassle for a man like me. I open the door to my apartment building and I see her she looks at me and rolls her eyes and then I see her smile, and I smile back. But I need to find out where she lives. Yes I know it sounds creepy but this is the woman that is making me feel things that I never felt before. She needs to be mine and mine [alone. it](https://alone.it/) seems from those smiles that we are both in love. Now I have to say hi to her every day. We are in love. We even go to the coffee shop down the street every morning. Everything was fine until I saw her walk into her apartment with another man. I thought to myself “this can't be happening”, and “she can't cheat on me”.

I was walking up to her room and without jumping to conclusions I decided it would be best not to and Christmas comes around tomorrow so I thought it would be nice to give her a gift. It's 10:00 pm and I'm listening to Christmas music. It was coming from her room so I had to figure it out when everyone left in the morning I snuck into her home and placed a hidden camera to see what they were doing later that day I see her on the camera kissing some dude that I saw her with yesterday I start running down to the second floor where she lives and I start running to her room. I start pounding on the door. I hear scuffling and I watch as the door creaks open with just her so I scream at her face” how could you do this to me?” she looked at me confused and a little startled “did what?” I was filled with anger I yelled “ how dare you cheat on me” she looked at me and laughed “I what?” 

I did something I never thought I could do, I punched her in the face. She screamed” BABE CALL 9-1-1!” I was so confused all I could say was “who is babe” after all we went through, after all those dates in the coffee shop” she screamed at me “you mean the one I work at” I was confused I figured that man that I saw on the camera manipulated her into forgetting about us. I ran inside and I found this guy around the same height as me but scrawny. I talked to him for a little while and he promised to leave us alone. I found her and we talked and she turned back to normal but it was like once she saw me she wouldn't stop smiling. I carried him into my apartment which was the floor above but I was tired so I took the elevator. It stopped on the third floor where I lived. Someone was waiting outside. They screamed and ran away and hid somewhere where I could not see. I was confused. Why was there a bug? I Could hear slight mumbling but I did not care very much. We arrived back at my apartment. My kitten was not eating. Before I went to sleep I heard a knock at my door. I went to open it. It was the police who tackled me to the floor. I tried to get up and ask what was happening but I got thrown into a police car. I overheard the policemen talking about how they might quit after a job like this and some of them were even throwing up. I don't remember much about the interrogation room but I remember them calling me a monster I was so confused as they read me my charges “2 counts of murder, 1 count of disruption of evidence” 

I was deemed insane by the court of law. As I was put in the mental hospital all I could say was “perfect” 

5 years I was out a free man. I was never insane, I was just a good actor.

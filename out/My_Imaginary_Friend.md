This is kinda long, but I need someone to know so they don’t make the same mistakes as me. When I was little I had an imaginary friend. She was skinny, pale, had blue lipstick, and had this cool choker around her neck. When I would draw her my friends would call her scary and suggested meeting a mermaid or a unicorn. I thought she was adorable, with her hair cut short, her white eyes, and her smile. Her very caring smile. I always thought she was more of an angel. So much so I named her Angel. She came with me everywhere, with my friends, with my family, or when I was getting chocolate from my grandma down the road. Over time I learned that we had the same interests. Even though she never spoke. 


My parents were worried when Angel was still around when I was 13. They tried to get me into other things like hiking or swimming. I loved to swim, but whenever I would start to walk towards the water Angel would let out a screech unlike any other. Scratchy, broken almost. I learned to avoid it. As I got older I would notice more things about Angel. She had bruises almost everywhere. When I would ask her about it, she would simply point outside, make a falling motion, and giggle without ever making a sound. People would make fun of me, but I didn’t care. Angel was always there for me. They weren’t.


Eventually in highschool I got a boyfriend, Evan. He was kind, charming, and could make you laugh so easily. I was head over heels, Angel never liked him though. She would always flip him off or try to slap him. This continued for years until me and Evan got married. Angel was the worst on that day. She would let out her broken screech and for the first time she touched me. Actual contact. She pushed me back when trying to leave the house to get ready. I figured I was going through extreme wedding jitter’s since she wasn’t real. She was just a character I made up as a kid, one that not even Evan knew about. Ever since I ignored her screeches, her freakouts, hell I ignored her in general. I wish I didn’t.  When my 23rd birthday came around I saw Angel looking upset. A part of me still cared for her deeply, but I was too proud to admit it. I think she had given up by that night. When I went to my girls' party, my friends dared me to cut my long hair. The hair I had grown for years. I was drunk and foolish so I agreed. When it was done, I noticed the similarities of my hair to Angels. It looked almost exactly the same, just hers was a little longer. I didn’t think much of it.


When I was on the way home I was excited to show Evan my new haircut. Angel was trying to stop me. She started crying too. I again ignored her. When I walked in the door I saw Evan waiting for me on the couch. He just looked at me for a minute. Eventually to end the awkwardness I asked him if he liked it. He started screaming at me, saying how I know he likes long hair. That I did this to hurt him. How he told me if I ever cut it he would kill me. I did remember that, but I thought he was just joking. Now I know he was serious. He grabbed me by the hair and starts to walk me towards the bathroom. I was screaming the whole time… He opened the door to a bath he prepared for us, candles lit and rose petals everywhere. He through me on the ground knocking me to my knees right by the tub. Right then I heard Angels screech, the first time I really heard it in a while. This one was different though. She was in so much pain. Evan ended up grabbing my hair and dunking me underwater, not letting me back up. I remember screaming but only bubbles arose. Eventually he let me breathe and left the room. That was the first time he hurt me… Angel was right beside me. I took a minute to breathe, get everything together and that's when Angel showed me a scar on her leg. The same one I have from a bicycle accident when I was around 9. That's when I finally realized… Angel was me in the future. Hell, not in the future, she’s me when I’m dead.

I’m at a loss, I’m scared, and I’m confused. 
This is my first post, I apologize if it’s a little all over the place I’m terrified right now. 

We’ll start by going to my past. 

Growing up I’ve always had a connection with the other side, I’ve grown up from a young age practicing witchcraft and allowing those whom have passed to connect. It wasn’t until I reached age nine I had my first experience with a negative energy, demon some would call. 

I was at my best friends house at the time, mind you porcelain dolls have always freaked me out. She pulled this porcelain doll out of her closet that was made with those strings attached to the eyelids to give it the ability open and close the eyes. 

It was freaky, but to add, this doll had the ability to sing nursery rhymes when you flipped one of the two pages in the book it was holding. My friend was wanting to play with it and so she did. She made it sing twinkle twinkle little star, then made it sing baba black sheep. It made me feel really weird and I had asked her to put it away. She sat it on her dresser and we started playing on her first generation iPod touch. I was so jealous because my parents wouldn’t let me get one with my birthday money I saved from my last birthday. 

We continued playing then the doll started singing. We looked at each other in horror and disbelief. It stopped. We were scared but relieved it stopped but we clearly spoke too soon as it started singing the last song, but the page didn’t flip so why did that start happening? She turned the battery off but it kept singing..it wouldn’t stop. The eyes started opening and closing, at this point we weren’t touching the doll, we were far from it. She took the batteries out and this time when it kept going it was in a dark, very slow pitched voice, something you only see in the scary movies. After a few minutes when I left the room she called me over and said it had stopped. We threw it out in the dumpster in the garage and that was the end of that.

My next negative experience was back in 2010 about a year later, we were moving to an area in my hometown that was rather new, none of the houses were built before 2000. It was a nice quiet community, when my mum first brought me following the moving truck I felt comfortable, it was nice…until we arrived, something felt off to me I knew it in my gut we walked in and all I felt was ice cold. I hated it. There had only been 9 people who had lived there previously, I know this because everyone signed their name on a piece of drywall attached to the walls of the garage. 
There was one name that stood out to me he had wrote “Dan I’m going to kill myself shortly after signing this” I didn’t think a second thought, it just must be a teen trying to be funny, whatever. Nothing too crazy happened in the first few years besides tvs randomly turning on, plates sliding off of counters. 2016 is when all of that changed, there could be a logical explanation to this but I see it differently. 

The fire alarms randomly started going off around every couple hours, then the cat got sick. 
For background we had a cat Jasmine, cat Tessa, dog Zoe, dog Roush. 
Tessa then sadly left us, but the odd part was the fire alarms stopped and were completely fine. About a year later the fire alarm thing started, we then lost my cat jasmine. 

My mum got my grandma, my sister and I two kittens they are sisters, Molly and Leia. 
When they turned a year the fire alarms started again and we lost our dear Molly, it was extremely sad and hard for us. 

In the upcoming months the fire alarms started again we were scared..what now? Who were we going to lose this time? Except this time the alarms went off every 30 mins. Plates would fly off of counters, picture frames flew off of paintings, my tv would change channels and adjust volume all by itself..it was extreme. Then I found out my best friend, my one happy place, my dog I’ve grown up with had an inoperable heart tumour and sadly passed a month after. Shortly after my grandmas dog Zoe passed and then it all stopped. We ended up moving shortly after Zoe’s passing and my negative experiences have since stopped. 
Until now. 

I moved in with my partner about a year ago, everything has been great! It’s the first place I’ve lived in where my surroundings felt neutral. 
On the off side, we live in the basement. It’s quite nice and cozy, yet there has been an infestation or so I thought. Laying in bed I can always hear small animals pitter patter it never really bothered me if I’m quite honest, sometimes it’s soothing. 

That was until recently. 

You know those panels in the ceiling in schools? Well that’s what we have for our ceilings, yet one panel has always been missing. I’ve been worried an animal might fall through that hole, but you’ll learn soon that’s clearly the least of my worries. 
Just recently I was laying in bed trying to fall asleep and I started hearing my daily dose of what I thought was critters running around. Suddenly I start hearing my mother call for me. I chalked it down to me being overly tired since I no longer live with her and closed my eyes. Until I heard this voice scream my name. Suddenly I hear a pounding noise in the ceiling and the walls and then BAM, dead silence. 
I start hearing a crawl to that missing panel in the ceiling. 

That was when I saw it, long boney fingers grabbing on to the ceiling which are connected to boney arms, and then it’s devilish looking head with a one horn broken and a horrifying grin staring right back at me say in the most eerie voice ever

“Did you miss me?”

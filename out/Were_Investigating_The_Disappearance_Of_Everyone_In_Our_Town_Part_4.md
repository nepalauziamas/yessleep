Man time flies.  Stores are already coming out with Halloween decorations. I wish I could get into the spirit, but I’ve been really stressed lately, worrying about everything.  Oh well, maybe I’ll watch some scary movies or something. At the very least, seeing the stores decked out with pumpkins and skulls has lifted my spirit some, especially since we got a ticket last week.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yeah, apparently, we were parked in a handicapped spot at the motel. With it being dark at the time and the paint faded, we didn’t have any reasonable way of knowing this. Despite bringing up these valid points, that son of a bitch cop still fined us. Whatever, if they want to send someone to our town to collect on it, they can be my fucking guest. Otherwise, we have way more important things concerning us. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Namely, the message I found in the library. We discussed it among other things on our way back to town after grabbing some McDonald’s breakfast burritos and coffee.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What could Alice have meant by it?” I asked and yawned.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My body needed time to process the caffeine so I was just barely operating beyond autopilot. I took another drink of my coffee.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Maybe it was short for inkling?” Carl suggested.

&#x200B;

“So she left us a hint that says hint?”

&#x200B;

“You’re right. That doesn’t make any sense. Damn it, I’m stumped.”

&#x200B;

“Well, from what we saw,  it’s not like she had time to write a clear thought-out message,” Nick chimed in from the backseat. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Maybe it was my drink finally working its magic, but his words made something click for me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Saw,”  I said, speaking the word softly

&#x200B;

“You say something, Pete?” Carl asked

&#x200B;

“What’s  the opposite of saw?”

&#x200B;

“Hm? I don’t know. Sawing means separating something so the opposite would mean putting it back together. If you mean, saw as in a tool, then I guess it would be glue maybe?”

&#x200B;

“No, I meant saw as in the past tense of see.”

&#x200B;

“Well, that would be not seeing.”

&#x200B;

“Right and what kind of ink aren’t you able to see?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Nick spoke again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Invisible ink,” he exclaimed.

&#x200B;

“Of course,” Carl laughed. “Don’t know how we didn’t realize it sooner.”

&#x200B;

“Well, now that we have,  I think we should return to the library first. It should be safe now,” I told them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While it was, that didn’t mean it was in good condition.  Pulling up to it, this time parking a lot closer, it was obvious just how damaged it was.  Shards of glass were all over the sidewalk and in the library. Broken shelves and books were scattered about. I sucked in through my teeth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alice is going to have a heart attack when she sees this,” I said as we were surveying the damage. 

&#x200B;

“You can say that again,” Carl replied. “We’ll have to cross that bridge later, though.  First, we need that book.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Searching for it was like trying to find a needle in a haystack. It took a while, but eventually, Nick spotted it sticking out from under the front desk. I figure it got knocked over there when I dropped it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Should we check it now?” he asked after picking it up.

&#x200B;

“I think we should check on Stevenson first,” Carl told him. “I haven’t heard from him yet.”

&#x200B;

“Didn’t you turn the radio off?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“ Oh yeah, you’re right. Better switch it back on.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He did so and then spoke into it. There was no response.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Stevenson? You there? Hello?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When there still wasn’t a reply, he shrugged and put it away.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Guess we’ll have to hear from him when we get home.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With how Stevenson sounded the night before, we were expecting a mess when we got to Carl’s house. Instead, nothing seemed out of place. The only odd thing was that Stevenson wasn’t already downstairs. We called his name and when that didn’t work, we looked for him. We found him in Carl’s shower, hugging his knees to his chest.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Whatever happened here last night must’ve done a number on him,” I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I waved my hand in front of his face and snapped my fingers a couple times.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yep, nothing,” I informed.

&#x200B;

“Move away from the tub,” Carl told me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When I did, he reached for the handle. He turned it to cold and then turned the shower head on. The freezing water caused Stevenson to scream and jump in shock. He seemed to not be all there yet and ran at me. I slapped him across the face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Huh? Where am I?” he asked while glancing around wildly. “What’s going…?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

His eyes fell on us and they went from being filled with shocked fear to whining anger.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you have any idea what I went through last night?” he roared at us. “I was hiding for my life because you all were too stupid to make it back here in time. Never before in all my years did I see some-”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He was hit again this time by Carl who gave him a hard gut punch. He dropped to his knees, gasping.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How dare you….” he said in a weak voice.

&#x200B;

“Calling us stupid?” Carl practically spat at him. “You nearly got us killed last night, but we don’t hear you apologizing for that. Now quit your bitching and get up.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson glared at us, gritting his teeth. We left the bathroom to allow him to collect himself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Man, Carl, he really got under your skin,” I said.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, it’s not like you,” Nick added. “What gives?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl hesitated for a moment and then gave his reply.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Let’s just say I can’t stand people like him.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Soon, we were all situated in the living room. Carl and Stevenson, who was now in fresh clothes, glared at each other for about two minutes straight so I decided to break the admittedly tense ice.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, I know we’ve had some problems this morning, but I think it best if we can get along so we’re going to apologize to each other. I’ll start.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I looked at Stevenson.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry I slapped you and I’m also sorry about hitting you with a waffle iron.”

&#x200B;

“Thanks,” was his only response.

&#x200B;

“Good, now you apologize to Carl.”

&#x200B;

“Why should I?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For someone who claimed to be a professional, he was acting pretty childish. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Because it will lower your chances of getting punched by him in the future.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl flashed Stevenson a quick smirk who in turn drew in a deep breath through his nostrils.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Alright, fine, I’m sorry about last night and what I said earlier. Happy now?”

&#x200B;

“Carl?” I said.

&#x200B;

“Apology accepted,” he spoke, doing his best to keep the annoyance out of his voice.

&#x200B;

“Good, now say you’re sorry to Stevenson.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Carl was struggling to allow the words to pass his lips. I don’t what exactly he meant earlier, but it’s clear there’s more to it than only what he told us. Eventually, he did manage to speak.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry about the other night too and for punching you.”

&#x200B;

“And what do you say?” I asked Stevenson.

&#x200B;

“I accept your apology,” he told Carl.

&#x200B;

“Alright,” I smiled, “Now that we’ve got that all cleared up, how about we tell each other exactly what happened last night?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson made a gesture for us to go first and Nick summarized the previous night’s events for him. As he listened, we could see him getting a look that conveyed he was realizing just how badly he messed up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Okay, I admit in light of this new information,  I may have been too harsh earlier,” he said, “but in my defense, I didn’t know that at the time.”

&#x200B;

“Fair enough,” Carl replied, “so what happened to you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fear crept into Stevenson’s eyes and I found beginning to build inside me as well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It wasn’t only the card trees, right?” I asked. “You mentioned there being something else. What was it?”

&#x200B;

“Honestly, I can’t really say.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The incident occurred shortly before ours.  He was outside at the time.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I thought that maybe I could try collecting a sample from them to study,” he explained.

&#x200B;

“By yourself?” Nick said, surprised.

&#x200B;

I was as well and so was Carl.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Didn’t think you had those kinds of balls.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson rolled his eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I wouldn’t have if I didn’t think it was safe. My plan was to break off a piece of one of them but then…”

&#x200B;

“The rain?” I replied.

&#x200B;

“Correct, I was close too before the first drops fell.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

While I can’t say I consider Stevenson a friend, part of me did empathize with how he must’ve felt. No way to truly defend himself in the face of a roaring shitstorm. I know we’ve been in similar situations plenty of times.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m always so careful. Unfortunately, bad luck has a way of overriding caution.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

That was something else I could agree with. Honestly, I still can’t tell if our luck is good or bad. Whatever the case, it’s at least gotten us this far. I just hope it doesn’t run out soon.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At that moment I panicked,” Stevenson continued. “I fled, but they were already moving and there was no way I could outrun them.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were on the edge of our seats now. I was thinking about what I’d be doing in his situation. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Since that was the case, the only thing I could think to do was hide somewhere so I climbed up one of the trees.”

&#x200B;

“You climbed?” Nick asked.

&#x200B;

“Yes, I hadn’t climbed a tree since I was ten. I scrambled up that thing and waited while they were roaming around. Getting soaked was bad. Knowing I could be snatched up at any moment was even worse.”

&#x200B;

“So how did you get back here?” Carl inquired.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson straightened himself and coughed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“They spotted me,” he said hoarsely. “God, I thought it was the end for me. Then it came.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I leaned in close, feeling myself get tense.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I couldn’t see it clearly because of the rain. All I could tell was that it seemed humanoid. The card trees noticed it too and tried to attack it. They never stood a chance. It cut them somehow. Even through the rain, I could see them get sliced to pieces. Their screams were so loud. The only positive was that it gave me time to escape.”

&#x200B;

“Do you think Inde has something to do with it?” I asked Carl and Nick.

&#x200B;

“Who?” Stevenson replied.

&#x200B;

“Evil god that we think may be an eldritch abomination,” I explained to him.

&#x200B;

“Really? I’ve heard of them. Could you tell me more?”

&#x200B;

“Later,” Carl said, “First, you tell us why we found you the way we did this morning.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson began to tremble.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It knew I was there. I  know it did because I could hear it laughing. As I was running, I could hear it moving among the trees. I came close to seeing it. Of course, it was pretty dark by then. What I did see of it, though shocked me to my core. The most disturbing part was that it could've killed me at any time.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heart steadily climbed in beat. With the card trees already being enough on our plate, this was the last thing we needed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I managed to make it back here. The reason I was in shock is that it spent the night lurking outside the house. Whatever that thing is, it’s not mindless. It likes to play with its food.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A thought occurred to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Do you think it’s asleep right now?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“I can’t say for sure. Why do you ask?”

&#x200B;

“There’s something I want to try and find before it gets dark.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though it took a while, we managed to locate it. Nick spotted its crystal red handle sticking above some leaves. In one of my old posts, I mentioned how my parents had to rescue toddler me from a monster during Christmas time. In order to do this, they used a special dagger that after the ordeal my mom ended up losing in the woods. I asked her about it and she told me that she must’ve dropped it on the way back to the car.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Truth be told, she didn’t even realize it was gone until much later. Now we have it. She was right. It does feel as if it’s alive somehow. However, contrary to what she told me, I didn’t want to drop it. The way it feels reminds me of holding my mom’s hand when I was little. I’m not sure how, but Stevenson thinks we should study it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We’ll be doing that sometime in the future. It may be able to help us against the card trees and that thing in the woods. One other thing I should mention before I end this post, we did find this weird tree that almost seemed to have been pulled apart and then collapsed back [together.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vvjyd5/a_cryptid_killed_my_exbest_friend_finale/) I’m getting the sense, we’re soon to be in for a lot more trouble.

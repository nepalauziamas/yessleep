My name is V for Vincent. I was kinda bit of a bright kid with always has this smile on his face. Those typical looks for a happy kid. I had a lot of fun and games in terms of socializing with other kids. Back when I was in middle school, I realized that I can be very good with the ways of words. I was talkative in class and pretty much always end befriending the "cool guys" aka bullies. And most of all.. I was so good with words, I can pretty much make everyone  do my bidding. By befriending them at first and then slowly influencing their mind with 'suggestions' on how they will serve me- I meant...  do me a 'small favor'. I was never the type to do my homework. And my so called 'buddies' would gladly do it for me. I actually liked it. Being able to spend more time on games and hanging out was the best time I could ever spend on my childhood. Another thing is that I'm always surrounded by people who's willing to serve my cause and I thought to myself if this talent of mine could work or move on to another scale, I thought to wonder on 'how can I use my' 'move of persuasions' to conquer the world someday'.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And so I pursuited Law for it. But when I was prepping onto college I managed to get a decent amount of grades due to my 'talent' of befriending people only for the benefit of getting good scores. And so I managed to get into a university with a scholarship program. Everything went the way they were supposed to be, except for one single exception . Since I never even worked my ass-off for 4 years, I only managed to attain a degree but never passed the BAR. Never worked hard for it. And never will be.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It came a time that I needed a job. Any job for the time being as I realized that it was mostly all for naught since I wouldn't be able to realize my dream. Well unless, I created a religion. There's a saying that "If you really wanted to get it rich, make a religion". In every aspect of my being, having a decent enough intelligence in my brain, I did exactly just that. After the countless tries of recruiting people and the Jo's I've received through out days, weeks, and months on end, it never... actually went well. I can say that I'm just all delusional at this point.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The reality kicking in really fast.. I've realized that my dream is just absolutely one piece of... Illusions, False Reality, An Idiotic Realitization that hits me like a thunder strike, the fear of how my own reality is turning into shits got soon realized. I've wasted a lifetime of opportunities and accomplishments for some delusional beliefs.

After several years of depending on the benefits of others. Tricking them into doing things that only benefited me, manipulating them, using them. I gained no literal skills to support myself and can't make it through life a tad bit easier. I can't even make my goddamn resume for God's sakes! I've had several attempts to make one but over and over I kept being either left hanging o get flat out rejected if I applied for walk-ins. But losing my confidence was the final nail that sealed the coffin. That thing that broke me down. Manipulating people for my oenown personal completely took it's tall. And finally, it suddenly came to the final... straw.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Devasted, and heart broken. The reason of it all makes sense and it's oh so bitter, regrets are flashing back in my memories in all one go. Light flashes back and forth just like frames of films cascading in to spiral, it reveals my past memories as they played back the moments of deceit and lies, slothful deeds that I've committed through out the entire span of my life.

Everything suddenly took a 'sharper' turn afterwards.. Considering the fact that I'm absolutely at rock bottom. There was much worse 'fate', that fate could offer apparently. I developed a some kind of emotional distress that reeled me into taking drugs. I did things that I wasn't supposed to. People who knew me,  eventually points their finger at me and just shamelessly laugh.

My thoughts became destructive, pessimistic, and even hopelessness. I hated everything.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Several run-in's with the law, proved it that... yeah, it's all f\*cked up now.. I started to experience all kinds of the worse feelings you could ever imagine. Regret, despair, isolation and most of all, a broken reality. Laying over discarded boxes in a typical alleyway surrounded by the walls of tall apartments buildings, a particular street of New York soon became my new home. Or atleast temporarily. Years passed by but I managed to survive by either asking for alms or donations from sympathetic people. It was shameful but I managed to get by for a time.

On a cold shivering night, just outside the streets. I placed my hands near a metal drum that stood up with an open lid, the insides of it is filled with wood and had a fire going. I pressed my hands Ever so closer for warmth, and a single snow flake fell silently on my reddened-shriveled face. I slowly tilted my head and look up. Sentimental, aligning my feelings along with the darkish grey clouds that enveloped the night sky.. It cignaled the arrival of winter as my old feelings started to drift away in the deepest part of consciousness. A sudden teardrop fell  from my eye down to the cheeks, I wondered if it ever was gonna get any better.

 Even I... feel something.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Pulling my worn-out jacket closer to warm my cheeks, I stared and placed my hands near the burning drum once again  to warm up a little bit and get through the cold night. Hopefully I just might get through another winter. 

As if reality wasn't quite done just yet, a rushing gust of wind passing all over my sides and the drum started to freeze over as it rattles and shakes, the fire couldn't withstand the frost any longer and it soon died out. I stumbled on my feet as I fall and landed on my back, the rush of cold piercing wind blew harder on me. My face started to get frost bites as well. I noticed my vision is getting darker. Blinking in and out of consciousness, I managed to get a peek of what's unveiling in front of me. I had to blink twice to make sure it's real. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The destructive gush of strong winds that blew in my ears made it worse, I feel like vomitting. Sitted at the ground, I felt episodes of  quakes and tremors suddenly emerging. As if the earth was being hit by two consecutive hammer hits. Making my heart beats so fast by the sudden scenario, I just shook in place. After a while I recovered and I tried to look at where the quake came from, but I suddenly noticed the sky is constantly getting darker, at some odd seconds, bolts of thunder screeches through the atmosphere lighting up the whole area... This, this isn't  just a normal storm. The scale is too big. The events of which I am witnessing right is nothing else but apocalyptic.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I noticed that color of snow is slowly turning . Losing the bright white glow that it always had, now completely shaded with something else. Greyish molds mixed in the snow as it twirls and tumbles down on me. I stood up as much my body could, raising my right hand to cover my vision from failing from the wind I tried my hardest look into the storm brewing so menacingly, with my eyes trying my hardest to look. I saw it moving.

More than a hundred meters ahead, A mutation of both ash & snow is forming a tornado the size of a skyscraper came into view. But it wasn't the tornado that unsettled me the most.

&#x200B;

It's what inside of it. 

&#x200B;

One deep monsterous growl rang out through the sky, Two Massive Horns slowly protruding out of tornado soon came into view. Tears welled-up in my eyes as I muttered these few words as I stared at looming despair I felt as if the end is closing in on me. "God... This can't be happening..." I choked my own words as I pleaded with 'God' for help. There was no answer. Maybe at this point, maybe... there was no God at all.

Even with everything that's transpiring.. in a whispher, I spoke and said to him, "please save my soul".

Hi, the entire stupid,dumb, unfair world is ending! Yep,you heard me. Right now, I’m currently hiding in my hotel room with a barricade consisting of a dresser and two nightstands. It’s small,but it should hold for a while.

I don’t know how this all happened. I just wanted a peaceful trip to visit my brother. I can’t even have that!
I found a revolver underneath my pillow earlier. I think this all may have been caused for a reason, but I’m not sure why yet.

By “this”, I mean the undead banging right outside my door, smelling me as they’re probably thinking how good my head would taste on a grill. They’re loud as hell.

The apocalypse started 8 hours ago. Everyone was in the breakfast line, happy and just making small talk with their friends or family. The staff were acting a bit odd, but I don’t think anyone else noticed, or just didn’t care.
It all happened so fast. Someone screamed. I looked over, and a lady was bitten by one of the servers. Everyone was scrambling to leave, I ran to my room to get my phone and call for help. 911 is just going to voicemail. I think the zombies got to them. I hope someone called the cops or the Swat, or someone, anyone! Some other people went into their rooms too, I think. I hope they’re alright.
I don’t think I was bitten, but I did hurt my ankle like hell while running to the elevator.

Wanna know what else? One of the people down there had a kid. An infant, she told me, who just turned 1 month old. Life sucks when it throws an apocalypse your way. I hope those two are okay.

On the topic of zombies, though!
If you’ve watched enough horror movies like me, you could probably already guess the usual symptoms. Biting, extreme hunger, growling and moaning, all that great stuff. Zombie movies made one fatal error, though. Zombies are NOT slow at all. I might have well ran an Olympic track with how fucking fast they were, chasing me down like I was a dollar on a fishing line.
I tripped over a stupid suitcase. Who decided to just drop a suitcase in the middle of a packed hotel lobby?! Whoever did that, I hope you died and got turned into an ugly zombie! 
By the way,I should probably introduce myself. My name is Fawn Olive. Stupid name, don’t judge it. I’m 18, (they/them prns)
I’m from LA, but I’m moving back from Chicago to see my little brother.

I’m gonna try to sleep. 
If I don’t update later, then you can probably guess what happened to me lol

But in the possibility I live to see tomorrow, does anyone have any ideas on what I should do? I’m on limited resources and the barricade won’t seem to last long.

Well,I think that’s enough info for this post. I’ll update later if I can, buhbyeeee!

{Yuhhhh, first post on here!}

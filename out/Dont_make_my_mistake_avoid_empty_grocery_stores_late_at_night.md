I realised I had run out of tomato sauce late at night when I had already cooked the pasta. It was really late and I quickly got dressed and rushed over to my car to drive to a grocery store that would be open at this hour. I did a quick google search and found out that a grocery store not too far away from me was still open and would be open until 12. 

I had the choice of going to this grocery store I’ve never went to, which was only a fifteen minute drive away or go to my usual 24/7 servo thirty minutes away. Obviously I chose the former. 

As I drove up to to the medium sized building in the dark silent night, my fear levels rose slightly. A deep gut instinct telling me to abandon the idea of shopping here bothered me like an itch that desperately needed to be scratched. I disregarded all of this and parked my car in the barren parking lot.

The grocery shop was a bright light in contrast to the dark cloudy night sky. The wind caressed at my face as I walked into the grocery shop. The sliding doors opened up and I was welcomed by harsh fluorescent lights and cold tile flooring. The lightning was bright enough to light up the place pretty well but it had that dim quality to it that gave me a light headache. It felt as if I had a dark heavy shadow over my eyes. 

The slight buzz of the lights made me nauseous as I walked further into the store. At this point I hadn’t seen a single soul in the shop and I was starting to get suspicious. When I first walked in and found no cashiers at their stations, it had struck me as a bit odd but not too concerning as I simply assumed that all the workers were on break. There was no one inside this store anyways so what was the point of tiring out oneself by standing at the cashier station. 

When no one came in sight even after I walked in the store and wandered inside it for a good amount of time though was when my stress levels started to spike. I had been wandering aimlessly in the fruit section trying to wait around for someone to show up and tell me where the sauces section was, but I abandoned that and decided to go to the aisles and find my tomato sauce instead.

Just before I was about to leave the fruit section though I realised something very unsettling about the fruit. I don’t know how I managed to miss it as I was pacing around the place.

The fruits were riddled with small holes. It’s not like the fruits were rotting and were starting to break down. No, they were fresh. It seemed as if someone had gone ahead and used a large needle to carefully poke holes all over the surface of those fruits. I picked up an apple and turned it around in my hands. Only the exposed side had those holes. 

Now this would’ve been less concerning if it was just that one apple that was affected by this weird sort of vandalisation. But it wasn’t, every single fruit that had an exposed surface was riddled with these small holes no larger in diameter than a couple millimeters. And those holes weren’t sparsely dotted on the surface, they were quite concentrated and not far from an organic sort of pattern like the pores on skin. The needle used to poke these holes must have been really sharp to create them so close to each other without causing the collapse of the fruit itself. 

And then I noticed some more minor details. The metal trolleys holding the fruit and also the metal of the shelves had been scratched. Long fine concentrated scratches that seemed to have been brushed on the shelves. Except the brush fibres were probably made up of sharp metallic needles. I could have overlooked this as a design choice for the shelves but the fact that the fruits had holes, made this fit perfectly into the puzzle. 

I had absolutely no explanation for how the fruits had holes poked into them so organically. Surely it would’ve taken even a team of people a long time to pull something like this off. 

I was officially freaked out and decided to just go get my tomato sauce. My mind's response to such an unsettling occurrence was to just leave it alone and continue on with my day to day life. I crossed past the fruits area and walked into the first aisle in search of tomato sauce. There were no signs above the aisles to tell me where each sort of item belonged. Another odd feature of the grocery store that I decided to overlook. 

As I walked into the first aisle, I realised once more that every single item on the shelves were completely covered in those tiny holes. The whole section of crisps had the packets all poked with holes. The mystery of this grocery store was starting to run deep and those holes everywhere brought goosebumps to my body

Frantic hurried footsteps came from the aisle adjacent to me. I stood frozen in the middle of my aisle, exposed to whoever was about to turn the corner. To my surprise, the footsteps stopped and I instead heard a voice obviously coming from their aisle

It was an old lady’s voice.

“Can you hear me? Are you in this aisle?”, she yelled in a frail failing voice. A deep panic ran through her voice and she stuttered over the same sentence several times. 

“Yes, I’ll come over to you”, I yelled back as I quickly ran over to the end of the aisle and turned the corner. 

“No stop! Don’t come”, she yelled in a frantic voice. It was already too late though and as I turned the corner I realised…

That. She. Was. Not. There. Anymore

In the moment I had turned the corner, she had seemingly vanished completely. I stood completely dumbfounded for a second when I heard her voice again. 

“Please go back to your aisle”, her voice seemed to come from the aisle that I had come out of yet it seemed to sound… a little distant. I ran back to my previous aisle and it sounded like her voice was still coming from the same aisle that I had just turned into. 

How could I clearly hear her voice coming from there but couldn’t see or hear her when I made the turn? It was like she only existed in that one specific aisle and walking out of it would make me unable to see or hear her. The only access point to her seemed to be that same aisle I’d come out of 

“Why can’t I see you?” I yelled back at her as lots of questions went through my mind. 

“I don’t know I can’t see you eith-”, she yelled before her voice was cut off and she started screaming. It was a scream that echoed in my head and screeched in my ears. 

“It’s coming for me!”, she shouted in a panic and I heard the sound of a heavy wet sponge being pushed across the tile floor. 

That’s when I got an idea

I frantically pushed all the items away from the shelf to make a sort of window to see into the other aisle. When I pushed everything away, I finally saw the old lady but her face was contorted in an expression of absolute fear and panic. She didn’t even notice me as she started to slowly step back from… whatever seemed to be chasing her. 

My heart was beating against my chest so fast  it felt like my rib cage was about to shatter. The constricting grasp of fear tightened around my throat and I physically struggled to breathe.

I broke myself away from staring out the window I had created and instead broke into a sprint around the corner to get into the other aisle. Yet she had disappeared again. I heard the old ladies' screams get cut off from the previous aisle. The old lady and whatever was chasing her had disappeared as if her presence was restricted to the aisle in particular in some unfathomable way.

I had had enough of this place. 

I needed to get out. 

I ran to get out of the aisles and return to my car when someone who I assumed to be a store employee appeared out of nowhere. I stopped dead in my tracks and stared at him. 

There was something wrong with his posture. His smile was a little too wide and his posture? It looked as if his back had curved inwards to such an extent that his body had taken upon the shape of the bottom half of the letter ‘S”. The guy said nothing but continued staring at me. His pupils started to expand as he stared at me and soon covered his entire eye. It was simply a deep pool of blackness like an ocean at night.

I took stumbling steps backwards and nearly tripped on myself. 

I finally lost control of my bladder when I realised that in the fraction of a second in which I closed my eyes to blink, the store employee suddenly had strange pulsating black tentacles coming out of his back. They seemed to be covered in millions and millions of tiny black fibres that all ended in sharp points. 

All the pieces fit together and the holes all over the grocery store now made sense. 

I quickly got back onto my feet and ran away from the store employee. His tentacles kept on extending to chase after me and one of them slapped me in the back. 

The impact of those thousand tiny needles quickly whipping me in the back generated an excruciating amount of pain. It felt as if my entire back had been shredded into pieces. I don’t know what it was that kept me running, but the pain didn’t stop me. 

I ran and ran until I found myself out of the grocery store and in my car. 

I collapsed in my car seat and fell unconscious as soon as I locked the doors. 

\*\*\*\*\*

I woke up in the morning, outside the same grocery store. The lights inside were still on and as I looked closely, the same store employee was staring at me through the glass double doors. 

I booked out of the parking lot the fastest I’ve ever done in my life. On the way home, I finally broke down from all the stress and fear I had experienced over the past 24 hours and had a full blown panic attack. 

What concerned me the most was that my back had no marks on it. Not a bruise or a scratch. It was as if that slap that I remembered so vividly had never happened. I still couldn’t forget the excruciating pain I had felt as thousands of needles broke through my skin and dug deep into it before ripping themselves out. 

As I struggled to analyse my back in the mirror, I suddenly felt waves of pain pass through my very backbone. Then it started to violently curve inwards. The connections between my bones began to break and snap as I screamed. 

Inky black tentacles with thousands of needle-like protrusions on them began to rip out of my back and start attacking me. 

I'm typing out this post as I feel those constricting tentacles puncture my body like I'm in an iron maiden

I should’ve just had the pasta without tomato sauce.

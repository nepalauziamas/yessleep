I got married young at age 20, to my husband, Martin. Usually young marriages don’t tend to work out but me and my husband really loved each other, we cared about each other deeply, and there was without a shadow of a doubt love in our relationship.

When I found out I was pregnant, that love just grew.

We didn’t want to find out our babies gender, We wanted it to be a surprise, he said he didn’t mind the gender and would still love our baby but I knew he wanted a boy. He was overjoyed when our son, Adam, was born. I had a great relationship with my son, and so did Martin. He was a sweet boy and one of the kindest little souls I knew, everything was so perfect, for years, Martin went to work whilst I looked after Adam at home, we lived in a nice suburb Ian neighbourhood, with a picket fence and roses growing in the yard.

When Adam started school there was no problems, but since I was a stay at home mom I was getting bored without my sons company. I would just sit, drink tea and watch tv, and maybe do some cleaning up if there was a bit of mess. After a while, the surreal perfectness started to fade, and everything got so boring. The same house, the same walls the same view outside, nothing was changing, I used to be very active and energetic, always on the go and planning stuff, but it stopped after my son was born. Martin had no interest in any of this, and It was the only thing we disagreed on. After a while my boredom turned to unhappiness. I felt unhappy all the time and my husband didn’t wanna do anything just about it. I brought it up with him many times, and how I constantly feel depressed, he just didn’t care.

I had enough of this life, this stupid man. 

I left, I took all of my possessions and savings, and just got in my car and started aimlessly driving. I left my husband and my son on their own. I was planning to go back after a week or so just to give him a lesson, but I got distracted, I lived freely and I enjoyed it. I got a job and saved up to rent a small apartment, whilst still doing what I enjoyed. Martin didn’t attempt to contact me at all during this time. My new boyfriend lives with me, and life has generally been great.

Until I got a phone call.

Martin has passed due to a car accident, and I may have to take custody of my son. Oh god. I felt racked with guilt for leaving my son and my husband. I got ready and drove to where his funeral was being held. When I stepped into the room, his entire family was staring me down, I didn’t see Adam as I was too distracted by all these people obnoxiously staring at me. After the service, almost his entire family started throwing insults at me and drowning themselves in their own tears. I kept being berated and put down by these people, saying I was a shit mom and an all around bastard, which I was. 

Fast forward to a month later,  my son is just moving into my house, I enjoy having him around because I still love my beautiful boy. But he’s so, quiet. He was always loud and on the go, he isn’t like that anymore, he doesn’t speak to me. Which I can understand any resentment towards me after what I did, but I still didn’t like it. After a while, I started noticing the weird behaviour he was displaying, he would pretend to do rituals at school witch his friends, he would tell them horrible things like how their all gonna die soon and there’s no hope for humanity. He’s 10. 

He never used to do this, he was always a normal kid. When he got home one day, he actually spoke to me, we had a normal conversation about school, and life stuff. Eventually he asked me if we can go to the store to buy him some craft stuff like paints and pencils. I bought them for him since he never asks for anything. After this he got even more antisocial, locking himself in his room and using his paint stuff. One day as was passing his door, I heard him talking to someone, and chanting words I don’t think were English. I opened the door, my son had formed a ring with red paint and weird symbols were all over his floor. “What is all this?” I said, clearly disturbed. “It’s how I talk to my friends.” Huh? “What friends honey?” I replied “My friends. Come say hi. Daddy’s here too.” 

I went pale. My stomach sank into my chest. I walked out and phoned the doctor straight away. They even examined him and put him through various tests, they all say he’s fine. But I don’t think that. His dad has done something to him. I know he has. I just need to know what.

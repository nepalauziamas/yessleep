 Everyone’s seen or heard of vague, fantastical rituals, and how most of them end up having terrible, terrible consequences for all those involved. There’s something that these games have in common with each other; you make a deal with an otherworldly being, either explicitly or implicitly, and either get a reward or consequences for how well you play according to the rules set in place. More than likely, all these games are just variations of something incredibly base–a contract with the supernatural, where the devil is, quite literally, in the details.

I don’t know what this original “game” –for lack of a better descriptor–could be, and I’m not brave enough to find out, either. No sane man would want to delve into a search for something that will kill them after they’ve already had a precarious encounter. There is that saying; once bitten, twice shy.

Thirty years ago, I played The Ghost’s Name, and I lived. 

Yes, the title is incredibly short, and not very catchy. Thankfully, I didn’t name it, so I can be absolved of the embarrassment. That is, perhaps, the only lighthearted aspect of it, looking back on everything; we shouldn’t have played it to begin with, but it should not have been treated with the levity with which we played it. 

Thirty years ago, I was a sophomore in a college, pursuing my degree in communications, and would often spend my free time with my friends, who mostly were either of the same major, or majored in business. We were not particularly popular. There were five of us, and Alex was often the one to propose we did strange things to get a thrill for the day, while the rest of us were mostly content with watching television reruns or playing cards. Looking back on it, this was evidently the main factor for the lack of popularity.

I don’t remember Alex’s main reasons for suggesting we play the game–he had probably heard it from a classmate of his, and I don’t know why we agreed, but as it happened, we asked for him to tell us more about the rules, and so he did. 

First, we were to go into a room without windows and any doors but the one that we had come through–since we were in Alex’s apartment, the only room meeting these qualifications was his bedroom. Secondly, we had to bring a number of things with us–three blank pieces of paper, two markers of differing colors, an obituary almanac, and a flashlight. Third, we would play The Ghost’s Name, and when we came back out, we needed to leave everything in the room, turn the lights out, close the door, and wait for three minutes to open the door again.

The Ghost’s Name is essentially a guessing game. When you bring in the three pieces of paper, the markers, the almanac, and the torch, you are bringing them into a room to communicate with a ghost. 

The three pieces of paper were for three separate things, the first for summoning the ghost–we didn’t do this by sounding out fancy Latin words. It was like a kid’s game, rather–you wrote a greeting on the paper in large letters three times after turning the lights off, set the paper down, and you waited with your eyes closed until you could hear the sounds of something writing on the paper. When it stopped, you could open your eyes.

You would then invite it to write down three clues about its life and how it died–so six in total–on another sheet of paper, and close your eyes until it stopped writing. You would then have to guess the name of the ghost, and only got one try. The time given to you to do that was an hour at most. (Since Alex’s room had a clock, we didn’t bring any timers in.)

After that, you would write the ghost’s name on the third piece of paper. If it was ripped into pieces, you guessed wrong. If the paper was flipped over, you guessed right, and the ghost could move on into the afterlife peacefully. No matter the outcome, that was when you would come out.

When Alex explained the rules to us, we all laughed. None of us believed in that sort of stuff! But upon his insistence, we decided to give it a shot (after having some shots of our own) and ripped some pages out of our notebooks. Theresa went into her apartment to acquire two versions of the same 10-kilogram 1992 state almanac, and we all pushed a wide-eyed Dean, giggling, into Alex’s bedroom at one in the morning.

The rest of us then busied ourselves with… watching television reruns or playing cards. Theresa was particularly interested in playing Bluff with Cathy. This went on for twenty minutes. At half an hour, I had another beer. We all started getting antsy at fifty minutes in, and Alex was about to open the door to the bedroom when the entire apartment’s power went out.

Here is some insight as to how Alex’s apartment was structured; it was a shoebox, so there was one large open living space, and one bedroom. The bathrooms were shared by the entire floor of the building, and since the apartment was between two others, there were no windows to speak of, either. It was a very cheap space, but now he was paying a much steeper price for it. 

Remember how, at the very start, I specified the room must have no windows and only doors that could be used as entryways? It turned out that the entire apartment fit those qualifications. 

We only figured this out after ten minutes of painstakingly trying to turn the power back on, or leaving the apartment. The door was locked–almost welded shut, and even I couldn’t manage to turn the knob open.

Something in the game had gone very, very wrong when Dean had played it. 

Theresa was the first one to have something written on her paper–she turned her flashlight on and screamed. None of us had written any greetings at that point, but since Dean had already invited the ghost in, that step had been skipped. 

She held up the pieces of paper for us all to see: one of them said “NO TALKING. GUESS MY NAME.” The other had six “clues” written on it; the ghost had drowned–not in a pool–and was young while doing so. When it had been alive, it had a pet dog, blonde hair, and glasses. 

I don’t particularly want to think about how hellish those minutes were; how it was pitch black throughout the apartment–darker than that, really, and even when we turned our flashlights on, it was as though the light kept on getting reduced over time. It was as though the darkness was eating through it, centimeter by centimeter. The rustling of the papers as they flipped–over and over, for each of us. The eerie silence, only punctuated by gasps as we all tried to breathe normally and flipped through the shared almanac, which one of us had managed to push through the center. 

I couldn’t tell how much time had passed before I heard more scribbling of a marker, and then a whimper. The darkness seemed to grow blacker than before–almost like a warning. This happened more and more, and soon four hands on the book became three, then two. 

I kept on shaking. As I flipped through description after description of people drowning, I kept on crying silently. Eventually, I found someone–a tiny blonde girl, who had fallen into a tide off the coast while going on surfing lessons with her older brother. I wrote down the name while squinting at the paper as best as I could, because the light of my flashlight had been whittled down to maybe an inch of yellow. 

Then, remembering the rules, I closed my eyes and hoped against hope that I would not hear a ripping sound. Of course, I didn’t–that’s how I am here, writing this now.  I remember hearing the paper flip, and then not so much a sound as though a vacuum *pop,* not unlike when an airplane takes off and begins to accelerate very fast. 

When I came to and opened my eyes, it was just me and Cathy in the apartment. We checked every nook, every cranny–Alex was gone. Theresa was gone. Dean was gone. There was no blood. No signs of struggle. 

Shaking, screaming, we made our way out of the apartment and to the police station, and told them everything that we could. It’s honestly a miracle we even managed to file missing person complaints due to how incoherent we were. We were–are– terrified.

To this day, no one knows where our three friends are. People just don’t remember them. Alex’s parents still insist they only have one daughter every time I call them, and I still can’t sleep well at night unless I’m in a fully lit room.

Even then, I find it hard to sleep, knowing they have a fate worse than death. I wish I could find them, but I have a horrible hunch that the only way to do so would be to play the game again, and I just can’t bring myself to do it.

Cathy’s the same way. For thirty years, she’s been mourning the loss of Theresa. They were best friends, and she’s just never been able to move on–got institutionalized briefly for it, too. I don’t know, to this day, how I still manage to pull myself through a career, or how I got lucky enough to have a family. 

My daughter’s my age, now. And I worry for her. She’s been talking about some concerning things, lately, and it’s made me think about this a lot more than I should now. 

I’m old, and I’m still scared to death. In a way, the ghosts never left us. 

So this is all just a big, grand word of caution–I’ve already told my daughter this story, but I want to warn all you thrill-seeking college graduates out there, too–don’t play any fucking games. They’re not worth it, ever.

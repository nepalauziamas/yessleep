I don’t know if anyone will see this. I don’t know if I will see your replies. But it’s still worth trying to post this here in case I get lucky. I am running out of time and I need help getting out of this room. 

I’m not sure if this has ever happened before, or if anyone has gotten out of a situation like this, but I guess it's best to tell everything that has happened, so that you will all have a clear idea of the situation I’m in.

It started just past eight o’clock in the evening. I was in my room playing video games, since my parents were out on their date night. Being an only child, a night out for my parents meant that I was home alone. Normally this would mean I would spend all night playing until I fell asleep or until they got back. However, I was distracted from my game when I heard a loud crashing sound coming from downstairs. 

At first I thought the noise was caused by our pet cat Oscar, who, just like all cats, was known to knock over things. Sighing and wondering what he could have pushed over and possibly destroyed, I left my room to go check on him. Making my way through the upstairs hallway, I then descended the stairs and looked around the living room for our trouble making cat. However, seeing that he wasn’t there, and seeing that there was no destroyed vase or kick-knacks on the floor, I decided to search the kitchen. But as I got closer to the open doorway that led to the kitchen, I was suddenly stopped by the strange sight I saw. 

Staring towards the kitchen, I saw nothing but darkness. It was as if the doorway led to an empty dark void, with nothing on the other side. This was odd, and I clearly remembered leaving the kitchen light on when I went upstairs earlier. Yet there I was, looking at a pitch black kitchen. In fact, the darkness of the entrance to the kitchen was darker than I thought possible. Even the light from the brightly lit living room didn’t seem to penetrate the darkness. It was as if the doorway was covered up with a wall that was painted black. 

For a moment, I stared and wondered what kind of optical illusion could have caused the other room to look so dark. However, as I kept my eyes on it, the pure darkness seemed to make me shake, as I felt something wrong about it.

Terrifying, yet mesmerizing at the same time, I couldn’t help but stare deep into it, keeping my eyes locked as if stuck in some sort of trance. It seemed to be calling to me, yet it said no words. Its mere sight seemed to communicate and entice me towards it. But at the same time, the darkness it emitted some kind of terror or horror that simply cannot be explained. 

Stuck in between this tug of way between enticement and fear, I stood there still and staring. It seemed like I would not be able to move away from this moment, until I was finally distracted by a noise.

While staring at it for a good amount of time, I was suddenly shaken out of my thoughts when I once again heard the crashing sound. This time, however, I was sure that it was coming from the kitchen.

Upon hearing this noise, I suddenly realized the possibility that Oscar may have begun entertaining himself by pushing over some of the plates and glasses left near the sink. Thinking that my parents would get angry at me for leaving Oscar unattended, the fear of the darkness was suddenly replaced by the fear of a scolding. Quickly reaching the doorway, I stopped just before it and stuck my left arm into the dark room. Beginning the search for the light switch on the other side, I felt my way along the wall until I eventually felt my fingers touch the switch. However, after a couple of attempts flipping it with no result, I pulled back my arm with a sight.

But as I backed away and thought of quickly getting my phone upstairs and using it as a flashlight, I was horrified to realize that my arm was missing. 

I did not feel it. Glancing towards where my arm was supposed to be, I saw that there was nothing beyond my shoulders. Eyes wide, I felt shock and fear rise through me, as I desperately used my other hand to grab the area where my left arm should be. But there was nothing. Desperately grabbing at the empty air for a couple of times, I felt myself at the verge of tears, as I tried to comprehend what had happened.

Eventually, I ran my hand along my nonexistent arm, until I was touching the flat surface of where my shoulder should have been connected to my arm. There was no wound, no exposed muscles or bone. In fact, there wasn’t even blood. It did not seem like it was sliced by a sharp object. Instead, it seemed as if there had been no arm to begin with. It was smooth, with skin that felt natural. It was as if my hand did not exist in the first place. 

Unable to accept what had happened, I kept on touching the flat surface, as tears now rolled down my cheeks. The gravity of what had just happened now hit me, as I fully realized that my arm was really gone. 

I didn’t even feel it disappear. There was no pain, not even a single piece of sensation. One moment my hand and arm were looking for the light switch, the next it was gone and all sense of touch towards my hand was gone. I didn’t know how this was possible and I feared what had caused it to disappear.

Looking back towards the dark void on the other side of the doorway, I slowly shook myself out of crying and started to slowly back away from the door. Not wanting to be drawn in and enticed by it, I kept a steady movement backwards. Whatever was happening on the other side of that room was clearly the cause of my lost arm. 

Not knowing what it was, and not knowing if that darkness would stay in that room or start spreading, I started moving further and further away, before suddenly running towards the stairs and quickly heading up and back towards my room. Shutting the door behind me, I stood there, back against my door, panting and terrified. What had happened to the kitchen? How did it swallow my hand? Would it go beyond the kitchen or just remain there? A dozen more questions circled in my head, as I tried to find logical answers for them to no avail.

Then, with a hint of sadness, I once more used my remaining hand to inspect my arm. I didn’t know why I had to check it again, but there was this small part of me that hoped that my arm was just numb and that, if I checked on it again, I would still find it there. It was foolish of me to think of that. One glance and a quick attempt to grab where it was supposed to be only reminded me that my left arm was indeed gone. 

Feeling both hurt and angry, I aggressively slammed the back of my head against the door, as I muttered curses at myself. Emotion was rising in me and I couldn’t help but blame myself for an action which, under normal circumstances, wouldn’t have led to such a loss. But I was frustrated and needed to let out the terrible feeling I had inside. So I kept on banging my head, hitting it harder and harder against the door until I started feeling dizzy. At that moment I stopped and sighed, as tears dripped from my eyes, as my vision was left clouded.

However, as I stood there ready to cry out in despair, my eyes managed to drift towards one of my bedroom windows and notice something that made my heart drop. Holding back my tears and blinking, I stared and waited for my vision to become clear again. Then, still not believing what I was seeing, I rubbed my eyes, trying to make sure if what I was seeing was correct.

Normally, from where I stood, I would have been able to see the lights of the house across the street through my window. But at that moment all I saw was darkness. Just like the black void from the kitchen, the only thing that could be seen on the other side of the glass was an empty black wall.

A chill ran through my bones as I realized that the void was indeed spreading. Quickly realizing what this could mean, I felt my heart race, as adrenaline was pumped into my veins. If the void was at my window, then it meant that it was spreading. If it was spreading, then it could possibly start moving out of the kitchen and into the living room. I knew that if the living room was engulfed, then my main exit route would be completely blocked. With that in mind, I decided to act quickly and waste no more time getting out before it was too late. Part of me thought that I may have already been too late if it was at my window, but I tried to dismiss that thought as I tried to stay hopeful.

Knowing what the void was capable of doing to those it engulfed, and using the fear of that knowledge to motivate me, I soon started moving as fast as I could. Turning around, I cursed as I accidentally angled myself to use my left hand to open the door. Quickly fixing my mistake, I managed to swing the door open, before racing out and rushing myself through the hallway. All that I could think of at that moment was to get out of the house, as I kept wishing that the living room was still safe.

However, as I reached the end of the hallway and was about to descend the stairs, I was forced to stop immediately. Looking down the stairs, I saw that there was nothing down but an empty void. Instead of seeing the light of the living room, I saw the same darkness that was in the kitchen and outside my bedroom window. The void covered the entire lower portion of the stairs, and looked like a flat surface of darkness. 

Looking at the darkness and feeling the urge to stare deeper into its depths, I once more felt it call out to me. As if wanting me to come closer, its plain darkness carried that hypnotizing that almost pulled me towards it. If it weren’t for the fear of the emptiness of the void that conflicted against this pull, then I was sure that I would have moved towards it and be devoured. 

Managing to shake my gaze from the void long enough, I was able to cast away its enticement and instead focus on the situation I was in.

Cursing as I thought about the difficult situation I was in, I then began thinking of other routes out of the house. Suddenly getting an idea, I then turned around and rushed towards the nearest room. Opening the door to my parent’s room, I switched on the lights with my remaining hand and was glad to see it turn on. Somehow, due to an unexplained reason that I never figured out, the lights in the untouched areas were still working. However, my momentary sense of joy was quickly wiped away once I glanced towards the room’s window.

Just like what I saw from my room, the other side of the window was also covered by the pitch black void. Rushing towards their personal bathroom, I got up the toilet only to see that the small window above it was also covered by the darkness. 

Demoralized, but not completely without hope, I then rushed out of the room and returned to the hallway. Giving a quick glance down the stairs to make sure that the void had not moved, I then rushed towards the bathroom opposite my room. However, just like the other rooms, the small window atop the toilet was also blocked by the void. 

At that point, I felt dejected and completely drained. Feeling both physically and emotionally tired, I sat down on the toilet and attempted to bury my face with my hands. However, I was then reminded that I only had one hand to do this with. This only made me feel even more demoralized, as I sat there with one hand on my face as I cried.

I can’t remember how long I cried. But I do remember being snapped out of it when I heard a series of strange thumping sounds. It’s hard to describe what exactly it sounded like, but it reminded me of the sound of someone banging on the walls and stomping on the floor.

Raising my head, I glanced towards the open bathroom door to see that the hallway was still brightly lit. Slowly and cautiously, I got up from the toilet and made my way to the doorway, before carefully looking out towards the direction of the stairs.

I wasn’t surprised to see that the void had now made its way up, but it still brought a shot of fear upon me to see how close it was now. At that point I could no longer see the staircase, as it was completely behind a dark empty wall that took up a portion of the hallway. From my estimates, the void was just a few inches away from my parent’s bedroom door.

Looking away from the void after a quick glance, I made sure that I did not stare too long at its emptiness. So far I had managed to remain strong to resist its call, but I still didn’t want to risk looking at it for too long, in case its intense urging became stronger.

However, the continued sound of thumping from beyond the darkness made me make another quick glance towards it. This noise was louder than when I was in the bathroom and it seemed to become more and more agitated. Feeling terrified and not wanting to be in the hallway as the void advanced, I slowly backed away towards my room. Due to the thumping sound, my instincts told me not to turn my back against the darkness, as if it was warning me against something. Because of this, I kept my eyes looking at the walls, so that I would not be directly looking at the darkness, but would still have use of my peripherals in case something happened.

What I had expected to happen was the void suddenly advancing. Because of this I did not expect something to emerge from its depths.

From beyond the darkness, some kind of figure jumped out of the void and landed directly in front of me. For a moment I hesitated and suddenly kept still, not knowing if any sudden movement would agitate it and make this strange being attack me. Because of this, I kept my eyes on it, checking it for any sudden movement towards me.

What I was staring at was a creature beyond what I thought was possible. It was fairly big, slightly larger than a cat, but its form had no resemblance to any animal I knew. It had a flat fleshy body shaped like a tray and constantly leaking fluids. Glancing at the liquid, I noticed that It seemed like blood, as it dripped and soaked the floor. Examining its legs, I noticed that there were a dozen bone-like legs protruding directly under its flat body. Bringing my eyes back to its main body, I noticed a slight bump on its top. Staring at this, I was then shocked to see the flesh on this bump begin to part and open, revealing a dark eye that had a single red pupil. This pupil then turned its attention towards me, which made me back away in fear.

This movement seemed to be enough to trigger it, as it suddenly began making its way towards me.  Deciding it was now the right time to run, I then turned around and started heading to my room. From behind, I could hear a series of thumping sounds, as its numerous legs propelled it towards me. 

Since its legs were short, I had thought that I would be able to outrun it. However, the sudden pain on my right leg told me that I somehow lost the race. The creature was way faster than it looked. 

Stuck on my leg, I tried my best to shake it off. In response, the creature began poking me with its legs. At that point I realized that the ends of its bony legs were sharp, as I felt the pain of each jab it made. With me only wearing shorts, it was able to penetrate my exposed skin and pass through fat and muscles until it hit my bones. The sensation was terrible and excruciating. I felt each of its legs deep in me, as it tried to push deeper against my bone, as if wanting to get through it. It felt like a dozen needles were being inserted in me. However, unlike the medical needles at the hospital, these needles brought a pain that stung hard and radiated a heat that seemed to spread along my muscles.

Screaming to the top of my lungs, I continued my desperate attempts to get it off my leg. However, with its legs firmly embedded deep into me, I knew that shaking it off wouldn’t work. Because of this, I knew I had to change strategies or else have myself pass out from the pain.

Making a quick look around the hallway to find a decent weapon to use against it, I managed to see a nearby fire extinguisher a few feet away. Dad had always been obsessed with keeping the home safe from fires, so we kept a fire extinguisher in the hallway in case of emergencies. Placed under a table that held family photos, the fire extinguisher looked like the perfect weapon to fight the creature.

Taking a step towards it, and enduring the pain the creature gave me as I shifted my body, I tried my best to move as it kept on piercing me. By this point I had given up on shaking it off my leg, since I knew that it only wasted my energy.

Reaching the table, I placed my remaining hand on it as I tried to keep my balance. By this point a lot of my energy has been drained by the creature’s constant stabbing on my leg. However, with adrenaline pumping in my veins, I managed to urge myself to continue, as I soon moved my hand to grab the fire extinguisher. Weak and with only one hand available, the task of lifting my weapon proved to be a struggle. But I managed to raise it high enough until I was able to angle the fire extinguisher towards the creature, before slamming it down against the front of my attacker. 

The weight and force of my weapon was enough to knock the creature off of my leg, yet this also caused a great deal of pain to me, as its legs were forcefully pulled out of me. However, I managed to ignore the pain long enough for me to lift the fire extinguisher again and slam it on that creature that was now laying on the floor. This time, my second attack on it slammed against its top, right where its giant dark eye was. The hit created a squishy sounding impact against the creature, as I saw fluid burst out of its eye. It was clear that the creature was terribly injured by this, as its body squirmed, while its legs moved from under the weight of the fire extinguisher, as if attempting to take it away to safety. But I did not stop. I couldn’t stop. I wanted it dead. Because of this I lifted my weapon once more, revealing a gruesome display of flesh and unknown liquid. The eye was gone, as it had completely burst from my most recent attack on it. However, despite the sickening sight, I gave no hesitation. Before it could crawl away, I slammed the fire extinguisher on the creature for a third time. This final attack was the killer blow, as the creature no longer struggled. Instead, it just lay under my weapon, flat and dead on the floor. 

With that done, and with my adrenaline dissipating, I glanced towards the void and was relieved to see that it still had not moved. Thinking that I still had time, I quickly went towards the bathroom and opened the medical cabinet behind the bathroom mirror. From there, I took some bandage wraps, isopropyl alcohol, and painkillers. 

After ingesting the pain killers, I then sat down on the toilet and inspected my injuries. Getting a good look at my leg for the first time since the attack, I was surprised to realize that blood like liquid that spewed from the creature had dried and caked on my skin. Covering the wounds it had given me, the dried liquid now acted as a seal to prevent the puncture wounds from bleeding. Because of this, I decided against cleaning off the dried liquid, as it was probably the only reason I had not bled to death yet. 

Pocketing the alcohol and the bandages, I did my best to slowly stand up from the toilet and make my way out of the bathroom. As I cautiously looked out of the doorway, I saw that the void had moved once more. At that point the darkness was now only a few inches away from the doors of the bathroom and my bedroom. 

Realizing that I still had time to switch rooms, and preferring to hold up in my room than the cramped bathroom, I carefully made my way across the hall. Staring ahead and towards my open bedroom door, I resisted the temptation to glance towards the void next to me. After all, I did not want my earlier effort to go in vain by being simply enticed by its silent calls. As I kept my gaze straight, I also did my best to keep my balance steady, or else accidentally trip towards the direction of the void. Limping my way to my room, I managed to reach it without incident, before firmly closing the door behind me.

It has now been an hour and a half since I closed that door and I don’t know what is happening on the other side. I am too scared to check and be confronted by the void. Through my door, I could hear more thumping sounds coming from the other side. But this time the sounds are much louder and much more numerous. To make things worse, they occasionally bang on the door, which unnerves me every time.

I don’t know if this door could hold off the creatures or the void, but so far it has been successful. However, I am still very anxious. I fear that it might suddenly burst open and spew out more of those terrible creatures or, worse, the darkness of the void.

I am now trapped in this room and I don’t know how to get out. The void is all around me and there is no escape. Somehow, there is still electricity in my room and I am still able to access the internet. Because of this, I have tried many times to ask for help. I have sent out messages to family and friends on social media, but I have yet to receive a reply. I have also tried sending out text and emails, but, once again, I have yet to receive a reply. Desperate and hoping to get my plea for help out, I am now posting this in every social media account I have. Like I said earlier, I don’t know if anyone will see this and I don’t know if I will see your replies. But I don’t want to lose hope, so I am at least going to try.

On the off chance that this does get posted and I don’t find a way out of this, I just want to say one last thing. Mom and Dad, I love you very much and I’m so sorry for any bad things I may have done. I miss you two and I am very scared. I wish I were with you right now instead of this awful place that was once our home.

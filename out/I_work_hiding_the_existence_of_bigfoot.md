I recently bought a cabin in the wilds of North America; it’s surrounded by thick forest and my back garden is a fresh river. While I was cleaning the place and getting it ready to rent out I found an old DVD that looked very sketchy.  A simple “Jennifer” written on the front made me wonder if it was some home made porn. 

I forgot about it for a while but came across it again last week after unpacking the boxes from the cabin.  I sat down to check it out today and I’m not sure if what I watched is a joke or for real but I’ve written a transcript of what was on it and I’ll leave you to make up your own mind.

*\[\[ The video starts with a man in a white Doctor’s coat in a spacious office. \]\]*

My name is Doctor Thomas Declan and I am a scientist of 43 years experience.  I work at *the* top research facility in the United States of America. I am the head researcher and faculty manager for a top secret team of only thirty people who work hard every day to hide the existence of BigFoot. 

I’ve been doing this work for only three years; I took over from the previous professor when he disappeared without explanation.  At least, the facility on the whole is under the impression there is no explanation.  In reality the Professor left his position to seek out that which we work so hard to hide away from the public, he wanted to see BigFoot with his own eyes before terminal cancer took his life.  I like to believe that he did. 

Let me say; BigFoot is absolutely real - they exist.  I use ’they’ because there is most certainly more than one BigFoot and multiple species who survive in different climates.  I can say this because I have seen the real evidence and have worked to make sure it never got out to the world.  

Can you imagine what would happen if it was confirmed that BigFoot is not only real but that there are breeding pairs, family units? Different species? Climate specific species?  Everyone with a gun would be out in the wilds trying to get a new trophy.  We cannot let that happen. 

BigFoot is overall a dwindling species, a genetic offshoot of sorts and we aren’t too sure if it was 100% nature that made it happen.  My team is still researching every aspect. We have theories on the beginnings of BigFoot however as of this moment none of them can be proven.  I digress. 

*\[\[ The camera cuts to black before starting again with the Doctor in a lab of some sort. \]\]*

The first photograph of a BigFoot, Sasquatch in Canada, was taken by Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin.  It’s known as ‘Frame 352’ and is noted as being “iconic” within the scientific community. The short film that the frame is taken from was filmed in October 1967 and was quickly regarded as definitive proof of Sasquatch.  The original short film is stored in the archives at my place of work and has been studied expertly for over fifty years.  A team of the original researchers in the programme were sent out to track down the creature and prove its existence.  The expedition was out of contact for nearly seven months and when they returned they recounted stories of what they had seen.

* Eye witness account by Doctor Christopher \[Redacted\]. Statement taken by \[Redacted\] on the 14th May 1968.  

Recording begins/ 

Look I won’t lie, we all thought this was a fool's mission… At most we expected some primate that had gone undiscovered.  Doctor Sarah \[Redacted\] was the first of us to see something; she set up a trail camera and we all worked in shifts to take nights and keep our eyes around us for anything creeping up.  We had gone to the exact area the two men had taken the film and had set up camp facing the same direction.  

Doctor Sarah \[Redacted\] was on night watching the first night and woke up her tent mate Doctor Lauren \[Redacted\] at around 2.48am when she saw movement.  We had night vision equipment supplied by \[Redacted\] and were under strict instructions on how to properly use it. Sergeant \[Redacted\] was a hard ass about the whole thing.

Doctor Sarah \[Redacted\] wrote a description of what she saw and told the rest of us the next day; Doctor Lauren \[Redacted\] was using night vision binoculars and corroborated the description that was given. 

* Doctor Christopher \[Redacted\] is reminded at this point that they only need his own eye witness account and not hearsay as to what the other members of the team witnessed. -

I know, I know… I was setting the tone that we saw things from the start.  I was on watch again during Night 18 and we had moved our camp a little to be better hidden under the trees.  We wondered if the activity was low because we could be seen.  I sat in the doorway of the tent using the night vision binoculars and taking notes. I remember it was just getting light and it had been relatively quiet; lots of breaking branches and rustling but no sightings.  I don’t know the time because in my excitement I forgot to check… with the light just coming up the binoculars worked better and I got a clear sighting of it. 

*\[\[ a male voice asks questions. \]\]*

* of what? 

BigFoot, Professor.  I saw a female BigFoot. 

* how could you tell it was female?

The being had prominent breasts… and the other one had… well he was obviously male… I woke my tent mate, the civilian researcher Marcus \[Redacted\] and asked him to verify my sighting which he did.  

/Recording Ends

During the rest of the reports for the expedition they continue to see multiple Sasquatch including some, quote “child size” unquote, beings and a theory begins that this is a family unit.  One of the newer researchers, a psychologist and behavioural specialist Doctor Lauren, mentioned in the statement, decided to take it upon themself to sneak out of camp and follow as closely as possible one of the Sasquatch back to its home. Doctor Lauren was never seen or heard from again and was reported as missing, presumed dead. 

*\[\[ the video again cuts to black before returning in the original office setting. \]\]* 

The original team working on the information returned to the facility and made sure that the official statements given out disparaged everything that had been reported as well as giving their highly professional opinion that the whole thing was a hoax.   Most of the public believed the statement but there will always be those who don’t. 

It’s not just photographs and film we’ve worked with; although they are the most interesting in themselves as none of the media is clear, we have established through our research that BigFoot can emit a frequency that interferes with photographic and recording equipment - almost an inaudible self defence mechanism, which leads us to theorise that BigFoot knows how dangerous it would be to them if clear media were produced to the wider world.  This is part of why we believe that nature itself is not 100% responsible for the creation of BigFoot.   Again, I digress. 

*\[\[ Doctor Thomas Declan shifts in his seat and is clearly thinking about his next words. \]\]*

We at the facility have received multiple items that were reported to be from BigFoot; various fur and hair samples, nail clippings, liquids ranging from blood to semen and even an entire finger.  While many of the samples were absolutely nothing to do with BigFoot and were likely just fame-hunters trying to cash in, we did receive a number of samples which we concluded were from BigFoot. 

To understand how we know they are from BigFoot I must first explain that one of the teams many years before myself at another site linked to our facility did in fact carry out an autopsy on a BigFoot.  While on an expedition at a northern site close to the original, a team of scientists and military came across a lone BigFoot.  After four days observing it, it was determined that the creature was old in age.  Two of the scientists made contact with the creature and were moved to tears as he peacefully passed away; that’s what their reports say at any rate.  It was determined the best course of action was to bring it back to a facility where it couldn’t be stumbled upon by a well-meaning hiker or trophy-collecting hunter.  Again, keeping its existence from the general public is always of the highest importance. 

The report is over 85 pages long in total and is ridiculously in depth; describing even the most seemingly mundane observations.  The creature was labelled as Male Specimen A and using teeth and hair samples was determined to be over 112 years old.  His DNA was logged and sequenced over the course of years, his hair and fur from various parts of his body was sampled and experiments carried out.  Male Specimen A was a total of 289.56 centimetres in height; that’s 9 feet and 6 inches.  His feet were damaged due to what was assumed to be injury and possibly hierarchical infighting however, they were measured at 45.72 centimetres which is 18 inches.  Once we had taken all samples that we needed from Male Specimen A he was cremated and his ashes are kept in our archive. 

With every sample we are sent from Joe Public we have to make an official report for our records only and then another that is put out to the public.  We mark fur and hair samples as anything from Polar Bears to Chimpanzee to Deer; depending on where the sample is sent from.  These true samples are kept in our archives and marked for easy cross referencing in the future.  How do we get away with not returning them? Simple, once marked as false in the public statement they have no monetary value therefore we simply explain they will be destroyed.

Of course every now and again we have to send out an ‘inconclusive’ result which keeps people interested.  We tell the sender that the sample will be tested further to determine its source and then we request more information on where it was found.  This keeps Joe Public interested in BigFoot and makes sure we keep getting samples. For every five negative samples we receive at least one positive.  We have a compensation budget which is used to ‘reward’ these people who, no doubt, tell everyone they were the one to find proof of BigFoot - they become minor celebrities in their small towns and then as the people get bored of hearing the same story every Friday and Saturday night the whole process starts again. 

The samples we receive have proven without a doubt that there are multiple species of BigFoot; cold climates, arid climates, tropical climates.  It has also helped us go on to prove that BigFoot has multiple family units who every five to seven years switch partners to keep their gene pool varied and inbreeding to a minimum.  

*\[\[ there is a loud knock at the door and the video cuts to black before returning with a very disheveled looking Doctor Thomas Declan, speaking excitedly. \]\]*

My team is working on expanding the theory right now and the information we received from one of our outpost teams is astounding.  That was who came to my office.

Nature has of course had a helping hand in BigFoot surviving as long as they have but our theory, *my* theory, that it hasn’t been completely natural has turned out to be true.  

They’ve found new evidence that the human race has also been giving a helping hand to BigFoot.  Not only have humans been witnessed entering and exiting multiple known BigFoot lairs with medical equipment but also unconscious men and women. 

My direct boss has told me to leave this alone; that it won’t go anywhere because there’s no video or photographic evidence of it happening. But I trust the scientists at the outpost; I trust their word and they have no reason to lie about something we *can* prove.  I’ve contacted a Doctor Benjamin who understands my frustrations and has said they can get me to the outpost with minimal issue. 

*\[\[ the video changes to a cabin scene with minimal lighting. Doctor Thomas Declan is shivering as he speaks. \]\]*

I’m paying him $5000 and I have to leave behind any identifying objects and take only my phone without its SIM card so I can’t be tracked and followed.  I’m at the cabin now and awaiting my meeting with Doctor Benjamin.

I’m not stupid, I know how this sounds and I agree. 

That’s why I’m leaving this here for you to find Jennifer, I want there to be a trail of sorts for you only.  I know I can’t trust you with this information and I know you will understand.  If I do not come back I am either dead and gone or I’m carrying out what I consider my duty to help BigFoot continue existing.  I know there will be more people like me to continue my work. 

And please. Don’t be sad.”

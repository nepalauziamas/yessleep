I had spent the night on my couch. The toughest guardian between this life and my dreams I had ever faced. I gave my new girlfriend a sleeping pill and exclusive use of my bed, Not wanting to be a second b.Iigured if she wanted me in there, she would ask. 


She calls my name around 2pm. I have cooked breakfast and lunch. If she woke up hungry there would be food. I'd already put it in Tupperware and thrown it in the fridge. 


"Are you hungry? I made food but it's cold. I could make pancakes; I have chocolate chips or whatever you want" way too eager yet innocently, sure she would never take advantage.


She makes one of those sweet 'girl waking up' sounds that harmonizes with the ambient noise of the room and heralds '"Pancakes, with chocolate chips, sounds like my dream...except you're the one with the dick" straight faced, nonchalant...my girl.


I make some batter, pour in way too many chips and fire up the stove. I flip her a flapjack with precision spatula control. She covers it with syrup and almost forks my finger when I slide some butter between her and the cake.


I slide three more pancakes onto her plate, each with an exponentially higher concentration of chips. She doesn't complain, doesn't look up. When her plate is more syrup than cake, she ceremoniously places her fork beside her plate and apologetically explains.


"I had no idea what would happen...you're the first guy I've had overnight..."


"Look at you...look at me. I assumed there was a catch..." I do a hip-heavy dance that is awkward enough that she's happy and that I want to die.


She smiles with her mouth closed and says "I've kept everyone at arm's length, it was easy, until...you...this is your fault!" She starts to cry.


I place my finger under her chin and coax her gaze with my eye brows. I look straight into her eyes .


"I want to help, but you have to tell me what the fuck is going on"


"You'll leave. Everyone thinks I'm crazy!" The look of a cornered animal rises in her irises.


"The only sanity I've doubted in the last 48 hours is my own...but I have you to back 

up my story.."  I gently rap my index knuckle against her chin.


She punches me as hard as she possibly can in the shoulder.  She ignores my pain as she grabs my face and squishes her cheeks against mine. She throws her arms over my shoulders and hugs me for what feels like a life time. I'm still not ready when she lets go.


She looks off into the distance for an eternity.


"The thing in my house...is my Grampa, at least it was. The footsteps on the steps started the night after his funeral."


She exhales and breathes in. 


"When my parents passed away, he was around more, I could almost always see him or feel him no matter where I was in the house." She shifts her body like she was getting uncomfortable.


"He got...protective. He'd knock paintings off the walls, slam doors, walk up and down the stairs louldy. It depended on the quality of the company. It was worst when I'd have boys over, one time I was making out with this guy on the couch and..."


"Ok, ok, ok, OK! I get it, Grampa loves you very much and is very protective, esspecially  with boys. I'm pretty ok, Why'd he hate me?" I ask, buying the whole story, like it was free.


"That's the thing, I don't think he did. You came to my house, way too many times before we even kissed. I didn't see him once."


"Way too many?" I ask raising an eyebrow, she raises one back and we nod together in agreement.


She laments "if you could have captured some concrete evidence before I told you..." 


"Oh! I believe it!" 


"I don't think he's trying to scare you off, I think he's challenging you, like any Grampa would" She widens her eyes.


"So... I just have to prove to him that my intentions are pure or something?"


She nods "...and that you're not afraid of him...yes" 


"No problem" I manage to sound a little confident.


"You aren't scared?" She rubs my chest.


Thats why own more than one pair of underwear, baby" I hold her tight with one arm and pretend to hold some sort of weapon to the sky.


"I'm Captain Marvel, as the drummer in Scott pilgrim, in this one or I'm not in it!" She proclaims loudly, punching me in the ribs.


"As always, I will be reprising my immortal role as Tony Stark's brain in Thor's body."


"You are the salt of the earth Tony." She says oozing teenage angst.


"I'm Chris Hemsworth and I went to MIT... oohhh" I flex, unsuccessfully.


BANG...BANG...BANG...BANG...BANG...BANG

Comes from my front door.


I get up and put on the first shirt and underwear I find, the underwear belong to her. We're both terrified but erupt into uncontrollable nervous giggling. 


BANG...BANG...BANG...BANG...BANG..


I put on my own pants and grab the replica of 'Sting' I keep under my bed. She's about to learn just how cool I really am. I'm still fighting laughter, its the only thing that's allowing me to move towards the door. I look through the peephole. It's an older couple, both wearing glasses. I know my neighbors, they weren't that.


I open the door, resting 'sting' on my shoulder to ensure the conversation has a swift conclusion. There's a little girl with a yellow flower in her hair at my feet, she's crying. I throw 'sting' to the ground, kneel down and place my hands on her shoulders. My palms burn, I can hear my skin sizzling, the blisters raise my hands 2 inches from her skin.


She looks up. 


There are blue skies in her eyes, being pushed on a swing, a day in an amusement park, nights spent in a family cabin by a lake, camp fires, roasting marshmallows, the 9 hour drive. Long nights spent at his side.


I see my girlfriend crying , I see the reasons why.


I am shown the worst she is and ever will be.


I fall backwards and land on the shoe rack, it's cheap, so are the shoes, they absorb most of the impact. I am still laughing. I look down at my hands, they're fine. There is no one at the door.


My girlfriend rushes over to me, keeping her focus on the door "Dude...What the fuck?"


"I'm fine" I kiss her on the tear that had fallen from her right eye. "I know what I have to do."


"I get it" she kisses me deeply with tears in her eyes and heads, slow and sad to the bedroom.


"Really!?" I shout, genuinely surprised.


"I would have spammed your phone with calls and texts later" she shoots me the finger.


"Wouldn't be spamming if I answered every one" I grab the airborne finger she shot me and place it in my pocket...for later.


"Ok, I'm out for real" she heads for the bedroom.


"We're going back" I say, trying to sound tough with my belly in the air.


"ok.....fine.... I'll be black widow in this one"


"You just chill here for tonight, I'll be back soon, trust me?" I flash her my best puppy dog eyes, knowing they're closer to a fish.


"You're not just trying to get a head start?" 


I shake my head "Not in the way you'd think, I have a hunch." 


"Ok, trust and love you" she twills, obviously skeptical.


Smiling like a heroin addict, doing what he loves "Trust and love you" my voice generated solely by emotion.


I grab my wallet, keys and phone, kiss he goodbye hand run out my front door. 


I'd be back, I already miss her.

Does anyone else ever just randomly order shit they find online? Something from an ad or something that pops up on Amazon or something?

I do.

It fills a certain hole in me to get a “gift” that I don’t entirely know what it is or how it works. It’s like gifting a mystery to myself.

Anyway, I ordered “Anti-Wasp Cream” in the same way. Saw an ad for it, remembered that I am very allergic to bees and wasps, and ordered it. It was like $2.50 so it wouldn’t be breaking the bank or anything. 

When it arrived in the mail, I inspected it. It was a round pod filled to the brim with a tan cream. It was *thick* too. It had the consistency of mud. The logo was simple: a wasp with a red X over it. The packaging was almost comically simple. I liked it. The instructions were short too. 

> Apply to arms and neck only. Do not eat.

After looking it over, but not trying it out, I tossed it into my tote I use to store my camping gear, figuring that’s when it would become useful.

Several weeks later, I hauled that tote out, loaded it into my trunk, and left for a long weekend of camping, fishing, and hiking.

While unpacking at my campsite, I found the pod of cream and remembered why I’d ordered it. I would be heading over to the lake to do some fishing, so I applied it to my arms and neck after a layer of sunscreen.

With that, I picked up my fishing gear and walked down the road toward the lake.

I set up shop next to a big rock I could sit on. I sent my first cast and took a seat, admiring the view. The sun was in the perfect place to be blocked by my hat, and the weather wasn’t too hot. It was a perfect afternoon at the lake.

I reeled in and cast back out several times. That’s when I noticed a wasp picking its way long the water and rocks, doing whatever stupid wasps do.

I know it was bad considering my allergy, but I wanted to test out my cream. Did it actually repel wasps?

So, I moved toward the wasp, holding my arm out toward it and wondering how it would ward off the insect. Did the cream smell unappetizing? Did it contain a poison that would kill it the moment it touched me? I was dangerously curious.

If I’d had the cream with me, I would have sent a glob of it flying at the wasp to see what happened. That would have been the ideal solution.

Instead, the wasp *ignored* the cream and flew at me like I’d offered it a piece of fruit. It landed on my arm, which made me panic and start waving my arms, hoping it wouldn’t sting me.

I didn’t even have an epipen with me, it was back at the campsite.

The wasp didn’t leave my arm, and I slowed down enough to realize that it was *stuck* to my arm. Like glue. I stopped moving and watched as the wasp tried again and again to remove itself from my arm. Its stinger pulsed and flexed, trying to sting me, but every time it tried, the stinger couldn’t penetrate the layer of cream.

I became fascinated. This shit really worked! It worked *perfectly!* Well.. I guess not *perfectly* because now I had a wasp stuck to my arm that I was afraid to try and remove. How would I get it off? Should I just smash my arm against a rock?

That’s when I heard the buzzing.

Not the singular buzzing of the wasp on my arm trying to fly away with the one unstuck wing.

No, the high-pitched buzzing of a swarm.

I was suddenly enveloped in a cloud of mosquitoes. The mosquitoes landed everywhere on me. I was completely covered from head to toe, or at least that’s what it felt like when I started to squirm and scream and flail around, trying to remove the insects covering my body.

The feeling of all the legs crawling over me sent me into a frenzy. I dashed for the water, hoping to douse myself to wash all the insects off me. I dove head-first into the shallow water, using my hands and feet to pull myself along the lake’s bottom into deeper water. The relief of being underwater was instant.

I threw my head up out of the water once I was in waist-deep. My brain started to automatically do a survival inventory. Was I hurt? Was I covered in bites? It didn’t feel like I’d been bitten at all, just covered in insect legs . The mosquitoes had been washed off, though, to my relief.

I also brought my arm up to inspect it.

There was a clump of mosquitoes still on my arm, but before I sucked my arm back under to wash them off, I realized they were clumped around the wasp. They were going *mad* after the wasp, sticking their suckers into its body while it panicked and flailed. These bloodsuckers were tearing the wasp apart. I could only watch for a few seconds before I got grossed out and pulled my arm underwater trying to wash the wasp off.

That’s when the mosquitoes swarmed again, landing on my head and in my hair. I panicked and pulled my head under again, shaking my head to dislodge any of them underwater.

My breathing was panicked when I stuck my shoulders and head back up again. I was spitting to get rid of the taste of mosquitoes on my lips. I swiped the water out of my eyes and off my face with my other forearm, trying to clear my vision so I could see the wasp on my arm and check if it was gone.

It was not. But the mosquitoes were gone.

The wasp, however, was dead. Only bits and pieces of it were still stuck to me. The mosquitoes had ripped off the rest.

I was still staring at the decimated carcass on my arm when another louder buzzing caught my attention.

Luck would have it that a wasp landed *on my face.* It had come over to investigate the splashing or something and then been pulled in by the cream’s effect. The moment it touched my nose, I realized that I’d swiped the cream onto my face from my arm.

The warning of the cream jumped into my brain.

> Apply to arms and neck only.

Then, as the water rinsed some of the cream down my face and across my lips:

> Do not eat.

I resisted the sudden urge to lick my lips. The mosquitoes saw their new prey on my nose and swarmed.

I couldn’t scream before I pulled myself underwater. The mosquitoes took a lot of head-shaking underwater before they would let go. But the ones that managed to get to the wasp were hanging on and moving in on it.

Killing it.

I screamed underwater, unable to resist even though I was afraid to swallow any of the cream. I was losing oxygen and fast, so I planted my feet on the lake bed and lifted my head up again, sucking in air through my open mouth. 

Big mistake.

The mosquitoes piled in, I had obviously ingested some of the cream underwater. My screams became manic as I dove back underwater and sucked in lake water to rinse out my mouth. Little bits and pieces of mosquito were still stuck in my mouth, I could feel them bumping up against my tongue. The clump on my nose continued its stabbing frenzy, and I could feel the wasp flailing and trying to free itself on my nose.

I risked lightly swatting at the clump with my hand, but it only lodged the wasp harder against the layer of cream.

Eventually, my control was gone and I was full-on slapping my nose underwater, trying to remove everything that was moving on my face.

The wasp was smashed to death in my frenzy. Mosquitoes were dislodged too.

But every time I went back up for air, the rest of the mosquito swarm was there, trying to get back to my arm and nose to finish off the remains of the wasp.

It must’ve been over an hour that I kept dunking myself and reemerging only to be swarmed. The swarming only stopped when the remains of the wasp were completely gone, carried off or broken apart by mosquitoes.

When the swarming on every surface stopped happening, I abandoned my gear and ran up the road for my car. I was terrified to pass another wasp in case it was attracted to the cream and the cycle would start all over.

I got into my car, slammed the door and locked it.

I sat there for a long time trying to catch my breath. After watching a few straggler wasps pick their way through my stuff in the campsite, I decided it wasn’t worth it and left my gear behind.

I eventually had to find a car wash with a pressure washer to finish getting the cream off my skin. The stuff was *thick* and refused to come off easily.

Eventually , I got myself home and sat under hot water for another hour, hoping I got rid of all the cream. For several days, I was terrified to step outside. If I’d missed any cream, a wasp might catch it and land on me. And I refused to risk that. I canceled my work shifts much to the risk of losing my job.

I only felt safe to leave again after three days when I was absolutely sure there wasn’t a drop of anti-wasp cream on me.

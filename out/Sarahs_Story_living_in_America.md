Hello everyone, I'm Edgar. I'm investigative journalist out of the United States. I've been working on small projects for about 30 years, since the time I moved to this country. 

I've been working hard to uncover the Truth about what's been going on in the States and most of the time I'm met with radio silence. I've tried publishing my larger projects in some of the well known news outlets, with no success.

From what I've found, the major networks don't want to take on stories that might actually benefit the lives of everyday Americans. So here I am...

With my new series "Dystopian Truth" it is my goal to share the dark truth about "The Greatest Country in the World" and maybe I can help make a change for the better.


All of the following stories are true.


...


The story of Sarah.

Have you met Sarah? We've all met Sarah, or at least someone like her. A high school senior from a small town set to go to an Ivy league school. A real rags to riches story… Until she became a convicted felon.

 At 17 Sarah was student body president, head of the varsity volleyball team, had straight A's. She was very busy volunteering in soup kitchens and had started a Bible study once a month for the kids in her youth group! She worked very hard.

Sarah seemed to have it all, lots of friends, a steady boyfriend, and she'd even been accepted into Columbia University in fall. She was confident and caring, she was really going places… That is until she suddenly became very sick.

Around winter break, her symptoms started. She stopped eating because of nausea, vomiting, and migraines. She was very tired all the time, she became very weak, and when she was awake she was prone to frequent dizziness and fainting.

After a week her mom had decided to take her to the Emergency Room. As a single mother of 4 it wasn't easy, financially. However she couldn't stand idly by, and watch her daughter suffer anymore.

After several tests, an ultrasound revealed that Sarah was 10 weeks pregnant. As it turns out Mr. Daniels the Chemistry teacher has been tutoring her in exchange for sexual favors. 

Upon hearing the news about Sarah's condition, Mr. Daniels resigned. Sarah's mother couldn't afford to get an attorney and ultimately no criminal charges ever came to him. He was able to find a new position teaching a few counties over, with only a report in personnel file.

In the meantime, Sarah and her mom were compelled to take the pregnancy to term, due to the laws in their state not permitting abortions after 6 weeks, with no exemption for sexual assult.

For the next few weeks Sarah's Health continued to decline, liver function decreased, pneumonia.
Low blood platelet levels, Hyperemesis… 

She had missed over a month of school and was in and out of the hospital regularly. Sarah had lost many pounds and was a shell of the person she was only a few short weeks ago.

Her doctor determined that she needed to terminate the pregnancy or it was going to end her life. Under her mother's discretion they performed the surgery in order to save her daughters life.

Everything seemed to be going back to normal. Three week after the surgery, Sarah was set to return to school. She was eating again, the pain from the surgery was much less. She'd even been studying and planning the next student council meeting!

Then her world came crashing back down when her mom received a very discouraging letter in the mail… Among the bills from Sarah's many hospital stays, which her mother had been struggling to pay for, was a very official looking envelope. It was a court order for Sarah to appear in front of a judge in regards to her last hospital stay.

Apparently the insurance company's physicians disagreed with Sarah's doctor's diagnosis, and they denied payment for the life saving surgery. In doing so they filed an obligatory injunction with the state for an illegal abortion.

Sarah and her mom couldn't afford an attorney, and in this case Sarah was determined to be old enough to be tried as an adult. Even with the help of their state appointed advisor, She lost.

Sarah was charged with having an illegal abortion, she spent the last 10 months in prison with a fine if $10,000. You see, in the state where Sarah lives having an abortion is considered a class 4 felony.

Sarah's mother? She was charged with promotion of abortion, a misdemeanor. She spent 6 months in county jail, with a fine of $5000. During which Sarah's 3 siblings spent time in foster care.

Now Sarah's mother has to spend her time finding work, finding a new place for them to live and getting visitation with her 3 other children. Until it is determined by the state that she is fit to care for them.

Sarah's doctor was also charged, he received a felony for performing an illegal abortion.
Separately, he received a fine of $20,000, is spending 5 years in prison, and lost his license.

Sarah was released from prison last June. Columbia University revoked her acceptance and told her she will no longer be eligible to apply. Sarah never finished her high school classes and as consequence she was labeled a dropout. Sarah is being rejected by jobs on a daily basis due to her felony status, leaving her mom struggling in financial dept by herself. Sarah had to ruin her future to save her life.

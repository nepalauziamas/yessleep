I placed one careful foot in front of another as I made my way through the street, navigating a path through the crowd and the chaos. My eyes were closed, but my senses were alive. The charred scent of skewered meat on the stick, the saccharine fragrance of a dozen different perfumes, the indescribable sweet-sour-bitter-and-everything-in-between cocktail of the sweat and vomit and tears and blood of the thousands of people who lived and worked and shat and slept here everyday - all of it surged into my orifices as once, a fragrant smorgasbord of an entire city full of living breathing humans.  

The smell of life.

In the darkness, I breathed it in, letting the wonderful smell fill my entire being. A faint smile crossed my face. I was here. I was one of them. 

My foot caught an obstacle and I felt myself trip forward, colliding into a wall of flesh. My eyes snapped back open at the unwelcome surge of pain, arms flailing in an attempt to regain my balance. But it was too late, and I tumbled onto my ass.

"Watch where you're going, dickhead." My gaze righted itself, turning towards the scowling face that towered above me, hardened eyes glaring at me like a pair of daggers. The figure jabbed an angry finger in my direction, face turning red with fury. 

I remained focused upwards, frozen by the sight that brought me crashing back down to reality. It wasn't his angry, battered features that my eyes were fixated on, however, but the red numbers that were glowing above him, slowly ticking downwards. 

**0933:41:07:07. 0933:41:07:06. 0933:41:07:05.**

The sight of death.

The noose around my throat snapped back in place, squeezing the air from my lungs. I pulled at the invisible knot to no avail, desperately trying to fill my lungs with the same rich breeze it had been enjoying until that point. But it was no use. The air, the myriad scents - they had all grown sour, leaving my lungs gasping desperately for fresh air.

I averted my eyes, somehow croaking a half-hearted "sorry" before I stumbled away, away from him, away from everyone. All around me, ghostly red digits blared above the heads they were connected to, continuing their relentless march towards zero while their owners strolled around blissfully.

**4029:11:37:03. 4029:11:37:02. 4029:11:37:01.**

I tried keeping my eyes fixed on the ground as I ran, but the numbers found me anyway, reflecting themselves in puddles of rainwater and off the heads of those slumped over the floor. The ghastly numbers were beating down the doors of my mind like incessant drum beats.

**1618:23:20:56. 1618:23:20:55. 1618:23:20:54.**

I don't know why I tried. No matter how much I tried to run in the day, the numbers would find me at night, haunting me in my dreams. 

**0055:00:00:01. 0055:00:00:00. 0054:23:59:59.**

I glanced upwards momentarily, a dash of pity bubbling up beneath my panic. Poor soul. 55 more days to live. He had just lost one more, without even realising it. In the early days, I might have tried to warn him. But I had long since realised that no one appreciated that bit of kindness. 

No one likes it when you talk about death. 

That was a lesson that had been burnt into my skull by everyone who had meant something to me, before they had all left. For once in your life, can you stop talking about people dying? But it's easy for them to say. They're not the ones faced with ceaseless reminders of the fuse on our forgettable lives, the inevitable ticking timer towards our non-existence that begins from the moment we emerge into this world and take our first breath.

Still, at one point my obsession was merely a source of frustration for them, an exasperating tick of mine they had to grit their teeth and bear with. I was just being paranoid, perhaps even schizophrenic. I was just someone who was seeing things, someone who needed help. That is, until I became right.

All of them laughed when I started frantically warning Sally to take care of herself. Their laughter turned to annoyance as ruminations of how much I would miss her came up at every conversation; their annoyance to disdain as I begged her to say goodbye to all of her children; their disdain to open hostility as her body was lowered into the casket and covered under six feet of dirt.

I know they know I didn't do it. I cry when I step on snails after the rain, for God's sake. But that lingering suspicion, that fear of the possibility that I could actually see what I claimed to see, poisoned the well between us. No amount of tears on my part, nor police investigations affirming my innocence, was going to wash that away. I was Cassandra, cursed with the knowledge that I was right, but with the burden of knowing that everyone would hate me for being so.  

That wasn't what made me lose them, however. No, that came a week later, when they made the mistake of inviting me to their final farewell for Sally, assuming that even someone like me had the right to say goodbye to an old friend. Through the alcohol and misery-tinted haze, the words and numbers tumbled out of my mouth uncontrollably, screaming to each one of them exactly when they would die. 

They pretended not to hear, of course. They acted like I was a lunatic, spewing out meaningless words in my grief and insanity. They feigned an easy tranquility, as if they would not go straight home afterwards to calculate with exact certainty when they would die.

I knew they did. Because that was the last time I ever saw any of them. 

I can't say I blame them. It's better off that way. I would just cause them even more pain if I stayed.

I got to the end of the street without a panic attack, bursting past a decrepit gate into an abandoned building. A group of junkies fixed their revolting gazes on me, their horrendously short numbers laughing mockingly. I dashed past them, taking the stairs two at a time. Finally, I reached the door of the ruined room I called my apartment, crashing in only to nearly fall again as I stumbled upon some debris on the floor. The LED light, having dangled from the ceiling via a single stretched cord for the longest time, had finally come crashing down, leaving tiny fragments of wires and broken plastic scattered across the floor. 

Outside, the sun was already retreating behind the clouds. The shadows in the room stretched out over every corner, slowly driving out the faint light that still illuminated the space. I sighed as I sat down on the torn-up couch. It would be another long, dark night. 

But it was no time for despair. Sunset meant the end of the day. And the end of the day meant only one thing. Before I knew it, my hands were already reaching for the binoculars that lay by my window. My eyes honed in onto their target instinctively, zipping past the buildings and the trees and the stone benches and plastic blue slides to the rocking horse she always went to first.

And there she was, a small silhouette rocking back and forth. A carefully tied ponytail fell gently across her narrow shoulders, bobbing up and down like a fisherman's tackle on the sea. The darkness that had been consuming me dissipated instantly, a warm glow filling my heart in its place like a campfire in the depths of the night. I gazed through the lens fondly, unable to keep the smile from breaking out from my face. The setting rays of the sun were shining through her blue dress. It was as blue as the infinite sky, as blue as the soaring sea. It was the blue of an endless ocean of possibility, the blue of a thousand hopes and dreams drifting up into the air like a balloon, further and further away from this wretched earth. 

Oh little one. Oh Cheryl. Deep down, I knew that wasn't her real name. But it was what I would have named my daughter.

Her beautiful face was a blur, her features a blank canvass for my imagination to paint over. Her form was too distant to perceive clearly, but more importantly, so were the dreaded red numbers. Through the binoculars, the timer was an unreadable streak hovering over her head, impossible to make out no matter how hard I squinted. Just the way it should be. She could be anything she wanted. My daughter would grow up with the world at her feet, free from the curse of that guillotine hanging over her head

I watched her exhaust herself on the rocking horse before moving towards the rest of the playground. Would she choose the swings or the sandpit this time? Or perhaps even the monkey bars? She was big enough to reach the bars on her own now. I always tried to guess, but she always proved me wrong. That was the unpredictability of freedom, after all. I grinned as I leaned over the parapet, trying to get closer to her. 

Just as she started to make her way towards the slides, a small object flew through the air, connecting squarely with her head. Her tiny frame froze, the spring in her step instantly snuffed out she clutched her face. A towering figure stormed up towards her. Silent words exploded from the giant's throat, furious jabs of his fingers conveying all the messages I did not need to hear to understand. Her head drooped towards the floor like a Salvador Dali painting, the joyous energy of her body melting away towards the ground. 

My gut tightened, a constellation of white-hot rage bursting through my head. "STAY AWAY FROM HER!" I screamed into the air, tearing at my lungs until they hurt. That monster. How dare he treat my precious angel like this? How dare he hurt her? I clenched the parapet so hard I thought it would crumble under my hand. He was already dragging her away, hand still jabbing wildly in the air as they moved towards the exit of the playground. He was taking her away again. It was too early! We had barely spent any time together today! Every fibre of my being longed to dash over and sweep her up, relieve her of the shackles clamped around her ankles and release my beautiful bird into the sky. 

But alas, I could not. I sat down again, body shaking with fury at my helplessness. I would only bring her pain in equal measure to the love I wanted to give. That was inevitable. I closed my eyes, letting the rage pour of out me in a furious torrent, until I was emptied of everything except a hollow feeling of defeat. I slumped over by the window, unable to keep my head up. Our relationship had to remain a dream, confined to the depths of my heart from a distance of a kilometre, for both of our sakes. 

Knock.

I could barely summon the will to lift my head up towards the sound. It was just the rats anyway, clumsily banging against the disintegrating concrete. I'd flush them out with traps in the morning, if I could find the strength to do it. My head drooped back down, but then the sound came again, more insistently this time. 

Knock knock knock.

That wasn't a rat. The noise was coming from my door.

I looked at the fraying calendar clinging onto my disintegrating wall by a thread. Ah, it was Tuesday. I shouldn't have picked those bananas from the bin. My dinner had already been cooked for me. 

A faint whisper of life drifted through my body, sending a warm tremble playing along my spine. Dinner. Cooked for me. When was the last time that I had been able to say that, before this mysterious benefactor had entered my life? Yes, the food was often cold in the middle and somehow always tasted faintly like toothpaste, but that wasn't important. Someone had cooked it for me, had cared enough about my existence to hang their efforts outside my door. I had never seen who this person was, of course - I had always waited until the shadow at the foot of my door was long gone before retrieving the food - but through that flimsy wooden door between us was a tiny flickering connection, kept ablaze every Tuesday. It was better that way, where they did not have to know what I was, where they did not have to know what I would inevitably see. 

I eased myself up from the couch and made my way to the door. I hoped they would not linger long today. My stomach was already growling. A strange breeze was wafting from the front of my apartment. Strange. I had not noticed any new holes in the wall adjacent to the corridor. There was no reason why there should be a breeze from that corner of the apartment...

Unless I had forgotten to close the door. 

I rounded the corridor before I could halt my stride. Standing in the middle of the door frame was a silhouette, that same silhouette I had observed through the dirty peephole of my door, only this time magnified hundredfold and as clear as day under the light. An ageing lady wrapped up in a pink shawl, grey hair tied neatly in a bun, smiled warmly at me, crow's feet curving upwards as her eyes twinkled. 

I stood petrified, the breath freezing in my throat.

"Hello my dear. I noticed your door was open. I hope you don't mind if I say hello."

Despite her wrinkles, she had a peculiar youthfulness about her, with a vigorous energy running through her rosy features. But it wasn't her face I was fixated on. It was the numbers above it.

**0004:08:33:27. 0004:08:33:26. 0004:08:33:25.**

Four days. Four. Days. My head flashed hot and cold at the same time, a sickening churn crashing through my insides. 

She carried on talking, that same smile playing on her lips, in carefree ignorance of the executioner's axe dangling inches above her head. "My name is Mary, I'm from the council. I hope you enjoyed all those meals I cooked."

I took a step backwards, gripping the side of the door as I tried to find my balance. Everything was heaving upside down, the world spinning in a senseless tumult. 

"Oh, is something wrong, my dear? You look awfully pale." Kindly amber eyes looked at me anxiously. "Here, have some tea from my flask. I don't have much, but I hope it helps."

My mouth had suddenly turned bone-dry, unable to even summon the energy to swallow. I tried to avert my gaze, but my eyes refused to listen, darting back to those fell numbers over and over again. 

"Did I take you by surprise? I'm sorry, I can come back next time if it will make you feel better."

Her hand brushed against my arm gently, igniting my entire body in a shock of warmth. My knees nearly buckled and my resolve collapsed before I knew what was happening. 

"This week. You must value this week!" The words were tumbling out my mouth before I knew what I was doing. Fool. What was I doing? Why was I getting involved?

She looked at me in puzzlement. "This week? What do you mean?"

I couldn't tell her what I knew, but I had to tell her something. She deserved to know. 

"You have to listen to me. This week will be the most important week of your life. Do everything you want to do, make sure you treasure everything, don't leave any regrets behind!"

The smile returned to her face. "Ahh, that is a good philosophy to live by. But don't you worry young man, that is exactly what I plan on doing. My son and his wife are visiting from Delhi this weekend, together with my new granddaughter! She was just born last month! I am a grandmother!"

"When are they coming?"

"This Saturday."

My heart sank to the pit of my stomach. Five days away. 

"Oh I'm so excited! Can you believe that it's been three years since I last saw them? These past few years have felt so long at times -"

"You need to move their flight forward."

She blinked. "Excuse me?"

"Move their flight forward. Please, you have to. It's the most important thing you will ever do in your entire life."

"You mean my son's flight? Why, what's happening? What's wrong?" Her brows creased with worry. 

"I can't tell you how I know, but something very bad is going to happen this weekend. You might not - no, you won't get a chance to see them again, if you don't move their flight forward. You have to do it, please!" The words were gushing out of my mouth like a waterfall. I clutched her arms in mine, shaking them with all the urgency I could muster. 

"You're-you're scaring me Mister. What's going on? I don't understand. You're not making any sense." She tried to pull away, but I tightened my grip on her arm. 

"Do it, please! Don't you want to see your grandchild before you die?" 

She placed a hand over her mouth, her entire arm trembling uncontrollably. Her eyes widened in fear as she took a step back. 

"No... no I'm sorry. I'm sorry for bothering you, please don't hurt me. I'll-I'll go now. I wo-won't come back."

"No, I'm not trying to hurt you!" Why did they never listen! "I'm trying to help you, please just listen to me!" 

"Help! Someone help me!!" She screamed, desperately trying to wiggle free. I let go of her arm, sending her stumbling backwards into the wall. She crashed into the decaying plaster resoundingly, sending a cloud of dust floating into the air. 

I stepped forward and reached out to help, but she scrambled away, slapping my hand away with surprising force, eyes filled with terror. She tumbled down the stairs, her legs moving far faster than a woman of her age should ever need to, disappearing around the corner in a tangle of limbs within seconds. Her screams echoed through the decaying walls of the building, shaking the ramshackle plaster to its core. But no one would ever hear her. No one had ever heard me when I screamed, after all. 

I stared down the empty stairwell, my entire body numb. Why had I even spoken? I was a fool to have tried. No matter what I did, she would die this Friday. Her son would spend the first day of his holiday planning his mother's funeral. Her granddaughter would never know the face of her grandmother. And there was nothing I could ever do about it. It would happen, like it always, inevitably did. 

So I closed the door without a word, letting the echoes of her screams slowly fade through the disintegrating concrete. My leaden feet dragged me back to the crumbling prison I called my home, the day's light already departed, leaving me to fall under the darkness of my couch, alone. 

---------

I stared at the swing, watching it rock back and forth under the pale moonlight. The street was deserted, as it should be at this hour. No sane person had any business lurking on the streets now, when all other life had ceased.

My gaze roamed over the ashen embers of a recently-extinguished fire, settling on the crumpled cigarettes sprawled on the floor. My nose picked up the faint stench of alcohol leaking from the bottle of whiskey resting against the pillar, a cap full of liquor still sloshing inside. The whispers of the ones who had walked here hours ago.

My hand stroked the rocking horse, coming to a stop as it found the tiniest of resistance on its surface. It was a single strand of hair. I smiled as I touched it lightly, bringing it to my face to breathe in its intoxicating scent. A wonderful odour of sea salt and warm embraces filled my nose. Old Spice. A man, likely a father to one of the children who frequented the playground. Probably in his early 40s, if he was still using Old Spice.

Just as old as my father had been, when the accident had ripped apart his once-mighty frame. 

How I wished I could have stopped it, or even known what would have happened beforehand. I would have hugged him tighter, told him "I love you" just one more time. How many years had I spent wishing that I could have just known that he was going to die that day, that I hadn't stormed out that day with venom in my eyes, that my last words to him hadn't been 'I hate you', that the last time I had seen those blue eyes move was not when they were filled with a deep, aching hurt? 

Alas, I should have known. You should always be careful about what you wish for.

A faint crash echoed behind me and I froze. The city resumed its heavy silence, before the pitter-patter of feet against the pavement resonated through the night, the sound getting louder as it moved from a nearby alleyway towards me. I looked around in panic, searching for a place to run to, but there was none. The playground was too exposed, too open. But I had to hide, stop my eyes from going where they should not but always did go. So I hurried behind the plastic green slide, barely much taller than I was, squatting to make myself as inconspicuous as possible. 

I heard a low growl and the footsteps grew louder, more hurried this time. As they approached, I realised they were actually two separate pairs - one light and urgent, the second slower but far heavier, stalking closely behind the other. 

"Stop running." The low voice grated against my skin like hard asphalt. The tiny footsteps didn't cease. I could hear ragged panting now, high-patched and frantic.

My gut tightened as I squeezed my eyes shut. You can't get involved. Just mind your own business. There would be nothing I could do, anyway. I took a deep breath to steel myself, exhaled and then nodded. Yes, I would not get involved this time. No good would ever come out of doing so. The tiny figure was almost beside me now, but I did not care. I would simply crouch in my corner, let it dash past the slide in a blur, let that flash of brilliant light blue glide by me...

I knew that shade of blue. 

I froze. It was no ordinary light blue. It was the light blue of the infinite sky, the light blue of the soaring sea. The light blue of all that remained of my hopes and dreams.

My body moved before my mind could tell it to stop, bolting upright to stare at the little figure scrambling past me.

It was her. That same small frame that I had seen through the dirty lens of the binoculars every day for the past two years, now magnified tenfold and brimming with energy right before my eyes, like a tiny puppet coming to life. But the vigour that filled her every step was not the electricity of excitement that I had grown so used to seeing. It was the frantic energy of fear.

"I told you to stop running." The terrible voice cut through the air like a cleaver. A brutish-looking man lurched from the shadows, his features drooping uncontrollably as his hollow eyes struggled to focus upwards. He dragged himself one leg at a time towards Cheryl, a half-full bottle of grey liquor dangling loosely from his hand. 

Before I knew it, my eyes were already moving, following their inexorable path that ended right above Cheryl's head. I knew I shouldn't. I knew I couldn't. But I could not tear my unblinking eyes away as they finally came to rest on those ten haunted numbers. 

**0000:00:03:49. 0000:00:03:48. 0000:00:03:47.**

Sheer panic exploded through my head as my world inverted upside down, all good sense expelled out of my mind instantaneously. I stared at Cheryl, hyperventilating furiously, my hand clutching the slide so hard I thought it might break.

Three minutes? No, it was not possible. How could it be?

The world slowed around me, an array of images flashing through my mind as my eyes darted around furiously. A glint of sharp metal trembling between tiny hands. A single trickle of blood flowing down porcelain skin, forking at the cheek that had lost all its rosiness to the corpse-pale grip of fear. In a meaty hand, a broken glass bottle poked out between unsteady fingers. One look was all it took to know exactly what was about to happen. The monster. The monster was going to kill Cheryl. 

My legs leapt to life, springing me forward like a cheetah as I howled, raw anger and fear surging through my entire body.

"STOP!" He lurched to a halt like a marionette on a string, whirling around just as I crashed into him, sending the two of us flying through the air. A rancid stench of alcohol hit me as we tumbled onto the ground. 

"Fucking mad fucker! Get off me!" I gripped on tight, trying to prise his hands free of the weapon they clutched. But his forearms were made of corded steel, and the next thing I saw was a fist arcing towards my jaw. My head flashed with stars and my jaw felt like it had fallen off its hinges. I felt myself falling backwards, another explosion of stars as my head hit the floor, brighter and far more painful this time. My wrist went limp and rolled away until my back collided painfully with the rocking horse.

Agony coursed through my body momentarily, but my heart was already screaming at my legs to get up. They pushed themselves up unsteadily as I grabbed at the rocking horse, the entire world careening as I struggled to focus on that hateful figure in front of me. His ugly face twisted into a seething scowl, his right arm waving the broken bottle in my direction uncertainly. 

"You fucking sick hobo. Get the fuck away before I cut you!" 

He was too strong. I could not beat him, even in his inebriated state. But I had bought some time for Cheryl, time that would allow her to escape from his evil clutches. That was all I could hope for....

Then I looked behind him and my heart sank. She had stopped running and stood rooted to the spot, her tear-streaked face looking straight at me fearfully. The monster was now inches away from her, standing between the two of us. His palm opened, letting the bottle of liquor fall to the floor with a crash. The same meaty arm swung at Cheryl, enveloping her precious body in its foul embrace. Above her shaking frame, the menacing numbers howled at me, continuing their ceaseless march towards zero. 

**0000:00:01:30. 0000:00:01:29. 0000:00:01:28.**

"Get away from her!" I attempted to bellow, but my voice was no more than a raspy whisper. My eyes finally focused on their target and I charged, headlong and desperate.

He turned his body towards me, trying to divert me away from her, but I dived forward, arms stretched out wide. I caught the two of them and we toppled to the floor in a heap. Limbs and clothes rolled around in a mangled mess, everything a blur. One moment I was punching furiously at the monster, clutching at his thick throat, and another I had flipped around to come face to face with my darling, her tender face covered with tears and snot, a terrible wail leaving her mouth. She looked so beautiful, so precious. My heart ached as I tried to stroke her cheek.

"I will save you Cheryl! I promise!"

But a heavy fist collided with my head again, knocking me backwards onto the floor. The world blinked in and out of my awareness. Everything was a whirlpool of red and black. I flailed around, trying to find a grip through the tangle of limbs and cloth. My fingers brushed against a hard surface, and my palm closed around it, finding itself around the handle of the small knife. The hideous snarl fell into my field of vision again and my gaze focused, my mind laser-clear in what I had to do. 

"Stay away from her!" I screamed, plunging the knife straight into him, burying itself deep into warm flesh. Blood spurted out and his mouth opened in a scream, but no sound left his lips. 

His grip on me slackened and I finally came to a stop, breath ragged in my throat as my entire body shook. It was done. He would not hurt her anymore. My precious one would live, free from the clutches of her tormenter. Despite the screaming in my neck, I looked up, trying to ascertain what the new numbers were. 

But all I saw before me was his horrified face staring at me, eyes glassy with shock. I frowned, then I realised something was wrong. There was not a speck of blood on his face. 

I turned downwards, only to find the little blue dress soaked in a fountain of blood. 

"Cheryl?" I choked. Her face had lost all its fear and confusion, replaced instead by an empty expression. I desperately squeezed my hand onto the wound, trying to plug it as I sobbed. But it was no use, and I knew it was no use, because the numbers above her head blinked back at me remorselessly, completing the path towards zero that they had faithfully followed until the very end. 

**0000:00:00:02. 0000:00:00:01. 0000:00:00:00.**

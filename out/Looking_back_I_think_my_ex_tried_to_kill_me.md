Let me start this off with some background knowledge. I Sara 32f was dating Jon a 32m. 
We had started dating in middle school, best of friends and completely inseparable.
We got to grow with each other and support each other through all of our huge life moments. Like any other couple we had our ups and downs. But for the most part, we were textbook perfect. 
Jon one night when we were 16 or so had slapped me for the first time. I didn’t think much of it until we had got into this huge fight over some spicy content I found on his phone. We got into it and he had slapped me again. But this time, there was a glass table that he had pushed me into on “accident” we broke up immediately and I put a restraining order on him. I would be foolish to say, the order was broken not even a month later when he came back to my parents and pledged his apology and was determined on getting back together. He promised he would never lay his hands on me again. I accepted and we went back to being the happy and in love couple that everyone in our town loved. 
We got engaged and married shortly after Covid had hit. You would think that when you’ve been with someone for over 2 decades you would truly know
How that person was. 
I was wrong. 

At the start of the pandemic I was working back to back shifts at the hospital and ended up doing some traveling work to help bring in money while he was laid off. With me being gone so much it had allowed Jon to start getting frisky with some online girls who he ended up meeting up with. Now I had no idea about it until halfway through the pandemic when I was sent home from traveling due to catching Covid. Jon had gotten a “job” again and was gone often. One day he had left his phone out and something in my gut was telling me to check it. I opened it up and found messages upon messages of woman he was talking with and or had hung out with while I was out of state making money to support him. I felt dead inside, my heart was shattered and I didn’t know what to do. When he came back into our room I had put his phone back where it belonged and went to sleep. 
Any logical person would have left, but I had to think of it rationally as I didn’t want to pay him money for our divorce. I continued on as I would but slowly started distancing from
Him. When he caught on he started making these grand gestures around our house, he would clean and cook and do the laundry. Made sure my meals were done and plated for when I got home. 
Every time I ate though, my stomach would
Twist, turn, gurgle and flip upside down. I was convinced I was pregnant. I did a test but it came up negative. (I can’t tell you enough how relieved I was.) 

As I was trying to understand why I felt so sick after I ate his food but never after we ate out it got me thinking. 
He had made our dinner as per usual but when he got up from the table to do something I switched our plates. Halfway through eating he instantly said he needed to go lie down as he didn’t feel good. At this point my stomach was feeling fine. That’s when it hit me. He had been putting our dogs meds into my food with out me noticing. 
That was the tip of the iceberg for me and decided to go in and confront him. I walked into our room and he was frantically looking for something. I spoke out and told him, “I know what you’ve been doing behind my back.” 
He didn’t say one word, his eyes turned stone cold black as if he was possessed and attacked me. I thought I was going to die.  One hand gripping my neck, the other hand he used to cover my face with a rag. I was in and out of consciousness and knew this was going to be the night I died. I can’t tell you how many times I faded in and out but when I was able to get the strength I bit his hand making him loosen his grip and was able to get him off of me.  I called my parents and screamed for help right before the next blow to my head happened. 
I woke up to my dad and a paramedic standing over me, I could
Faintly hear them saying “thank god she’s alive” I was covered in blood, bruises and hand marks all over. Jon had managed to hurt himself and said it was self defense on his end. I begged for a toxicology report to confirm what he had been doing for the last couple of weeks and that he was at fault. Fast forward I had to stay in the hospital for an x amount of time to recover while Jon was in jail. 
He’s written me letters, saying how sorry he is and he never meant to hurt me and so on. I can’t say, it doesn’t hurt me because I wish it was him I spent my life with. But I’m thankful it’s not anymore. Learning to heal and recover from a life that all I knew of was him has been the best experience I could ever have. Needless to say, while he’s in jail I’m living it up making good money and traveling while
He’s stuck in prison wondering how he’s going to pay me x amount for what he did.

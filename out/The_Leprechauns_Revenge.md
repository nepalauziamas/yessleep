The Leprechaun's Revenge
The Medler's harvested fields had allowed us to see the rainbow's crest set within the field. Thomas, and I had been amused enough by the foreign sight to take a look at it.

'Maybe we can find a pot of gold for Rebecca's bash next week', I explained.

'If I find a gold pot, I'm leaving this small town.', Thomas said.

I laughed at his joke, as I had oftened done, when he expressed an indignation I knew he couldn't fall through with carrying into his life.

'Fuck', Thomas said. Grabbing my arm he pointed over to a large black three legged cast iron pot by the rainbow's edge. We walked over to it, as a bright shimmer had revealed the large oval shaped coins that filled the pot to the brim. I had tried to say something to Thomas, but he had already started collecting the coins into his pocket, and onto his shirt, that he turned into a bag.

It was strange seeing Thomas paranoid at even the rustling of leaves, as we walked discreetly back to our homes. Thomas had made sure I know our pace was too slow, and that I should hurry if I wanted a bigger cut of the gold he stole, which he had forced me to carry. Through the street alley that connected our homes, he reacquired the coins I had carried, and placed them into a bag he had taken from a textile bin. Without a goodbye, he hurriedly snuck into his home, through his bedroom window.

I assumed he would cool down after taking some time to process what had just happen, just as I had to do. With the 10 pieces I kept, I decided to store nine of them in the gazebo my parents where building. I would hold onto one with me, just to remember I had not been hallucinating.

I had grown more restless in the home, after the crazy day I had. As I sat beside my family on the dinner table, a peculiar hue of green light had emanated from the hallway, gaining only my attention , as the others seemed more concerned with the mushy peas on their plates, the light had however left me transfixed.

My mother began to nag me as she explained the take away orders can't always be good. My nervousness had dampened her appetite too, but left my sister unbothered. 'The foods great.', she said, almost as a tease to my wincing.

As she finished her meal, washed her plate, and seemed completely undisturbed by the light as she walked through the hallway. I figured I must have had some brain tumour or the stress of the day had gotten to me. I finished my meal soon, leaving my mother, as she had turned over to her phone.

'Yer Black Tan', the voice hollered.

I had quickly turned to my mother to ask if she had said something, but I had noticed a stout figure walk past in the hallway. Figuring it to be a prank of some sort, I made my way to confront it. Ignoring my mother's questioning.

'Where are you taking the knife?', My mother asked. 'Hey!', She shouted out.

Without a moment to think of what I was intent on doing. I walked into the hallway, and burst into my room. I was left to confront what appeared to be a Leprechaun, as he looked impatiently across my room for something

A metre short, ginger hair, emaciated, a ghoulish complexion and with that a horrible smell to go with it. With a howling voice he referred to me as the black tan, before carrying onto mock my family and I as sympathizers of dead monarchs. I was initially unsure of how to react to it, but the leprechaun quickly baited me to act out of anger, so I striked, and missed.

I was quickly out manoeuvred - disarmed, slammed against a wall, and with it bombarded by books, a bin, and whatever the leprechaun could find until I collapsed

'Punk', he laughed out.

He rejoiced holding his coin, as he explained Thomas would not be as lucky as I was to make it out alive. Helpless, I screamed for my mother, as he laughed at my misery, and knocked me unconscious.

Some days would pass, and I would find myself in the hospital. Thomas had apparently been beaten to death, his mother too had died in a car explosion, as she had attempted to drive him to the hospital. They seemed happy I survived, but I had hoped the Leprechaun had found the gold by the gazebo.

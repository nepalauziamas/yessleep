I stood up, bloody and bruised. My hands were raw from clawing my way through the dirt and I was caked in mud. I grabbed the shovel nearby and began to dig but this time it was of my own will. After a few hours I had filled the tunnel leading to the creature in the depths below. I brought in the fuel canister for the generator and doused the floor in gasoline.

Now that I was aware of it, I was able to stay in control as long as I kept my distance. I could still feel it crawling through my mind. It was pure luck that I was sent back to the surface to retrieve a pickaxe. I was only moments away from freeing it from its crystalline prison.

Before long there was a puddle of gasoline in the gardening room and a trail leading out the front door. I spent nearly two months in the cabin, slowly losing my mind, searching for *it* as it gradually worked itself into my subconscious. I don’t know what It is and I don’t know if I’ll ever find out, but I do know that I never want to be face-to-face with it again.

I opened my matchbook, struck a single match aflame, and tossed it just beyond the threshold of the door. The room burst into flames and a trail of fire blazed its way to the gardening room. I may not have been able to stop it but at least no one else would be able to live here and risk freeing the creature. I hobbled to my truck and drove away, my journey here was done.

The world behind me was set ablaze and the once peaceful blue sky now glowed a deep burgundy. Smoke filled the air and as the sun set, only the radiance of the fire illuminated the night sky.

I pulled onto the highway when blue and red lights began to flash behind me. It was the sheriff. I pulled over.

“This is \[redacted\] county sheriff. Put yer hands up and slowly exit the vehicle,” the man said with a thick southern drawl.

I opened my door, reached out far above my head and stood there. A pit in my stomach grew tighter and the world moved in slow motion as his next words left his mouth.

“Yer under arrest for arson, son. You have the right to remain silent. Anything ya say can and will be used against ya in a court of law...”

He paused for a moment before continuing.

“I’ve been watching ya. Ya’ll city folk don’t belong out here, interrupting our ways of livin’. I don’t think I need to tell ya but you’ve already dug yer own grave out here. The law don’t work like it does where yer from.”

I was struck in the head and the world faded to black.

I woke up cuffed to a bed in some kind of medical room. There were two men just outside the door in white lab coats arguing. The younger one smashed his clipboard against the window and caught me watching. He said a final word before storming off. The older man let out a long sigh and rubbed his temple. He opened the door and greeted me.

“Good morning, Mr. Bergmann,” he paused for a moment while rubbing his beard, “I hope you’re feeling better.”

He must have seen the wariness in my face. He let out a short sigh, breaking the short silence, and sat in the chair next to my bed.

“I know you may be a bit confused but I can assure you that you’re safe now. To tell you the truth, you’re lucky we reached you in time. The sheriff here is a bit of a vigilante. More importantly, you’re lucky you survived an encounter with an Amarantus. In fact, you’re the first person who has broken free from its grasp. There are no longer any signs of its influence in your psyche but we’re keeping you restrained as a precaution.”

The emotions came flooding back to me. The monster in the cavern, the fire, the sheriff, and now this… place.

“Where am I? What’s going to happen to me next?” I asked, solemnly.

“To be honest, it's not up to me. According to our tests, your psyche has recovered; however, my colleague isn’t so convinced. I’m not sure how long we can keep the sheriff at bay. As it stands now, you’ll be executed tomorrow.”

My stomach tightened into a knot and I heaved over in nausea. The man handed me a bucket and began to vomit.

“Of course, I’m sure I could convince him to let you live… if you helped us. You see, you know where the Amarantus is and we need to find it before it's too late. Guide us to it.”

I looked up, my face pale and drained of hope. One last dry heave and I wiped my mouth with a cloth the man handed me.

“Why would you possibly want to find it?” I screamed out in consternation. Those raw, repulsive emotions I felt as I crawled my way through that oppressively small tunnel. I began to dry heave once again, the contents of my stomach already expelled.

“I understand your fear, Mr. Bergmann, but I can assure you that you won’t be alone this time. We have a team dedicated to these kinds of missions. You will be safe.”

He paused for a moment, waiting for a response, but I gave none. I was too distraught to think. My mind was clouded and this still felt like some incredibly lucid nightmare.

“Mr. Bergmann, you aren’t the only victim. There have been many before you and there will be many after you if you don’t help us find it.”

The man got up for a moment and walked to a table at the other end of the room. There was a pile of papers he picked up. He flipped through them, selecting a few before walking back to me.

“I could tell you but it would be better for you to read these for yourself.”

He handed me the papers. They were  reports on previous occurrences near Crystal Lake.

**Missing Dam Workers**

**Dr. Olsen**

The construction of Crystal Lake Dam, formerly known as the Red Devil Dam, was completed after two years of work. It was named that because of the red silt that the river carried along itself. The locals called it that because of the mass suicides of dam workers shortly after its construction.

Thirteen of the dam workers were found in a cove nearby with deep gashes along their abdomens. They were found after the blood tinted water flowed downstream. Another five dam workers were found floating against the dam wall five days later. Each one had drowned. One dam worker was found by a local farmer, lying in the woods naked and covered in mud.

George Caraway was his name. He was treated by local doctors but the issue wasn’t his physical wounds. He only had minor cuts and bruises. The issue was he had gone insane. Any attempt at talking to him deteriorated into his babbling about finding “it.” He escaped the medical facility multiple times and each time he was found nearby, digging a hole with his bare hands. Eventually, he murdered his caregiver and has been missing since.

Given the context of other reports of similar behavior throughout the area from the start of the Crystal Lake Dam's construction to now, we can conclude that this is the work of an Amarantus and it lies buried somewhere nearby.

**Missing Persons & Violent Crimes Stats** **Dr. Olsen**

Mr. Beauregard,

To try and pinpoint the location of Amarantus 017 we have begun to analyze missing persons and violent crime statistics in the area, comparing those statistics to other known Amarantus locations and control groups, as well as examining the discrepancies between the reported statistics and those found in local hospitals, sheriff stations, and government buildings.

The final report on this subject has not yet been completed but preliminary results show that Amarantus 017 is likely somewhere below what was once Crystal Lake. We will be following up with you shortly on our findings.

*Missing Wife Murders Husband*

The new Red Devil Dam operator’s body has been found after a missing persons report was made by a local store owner. Mr. Thatcher, concerned about a recent friend who often spoke about his wife’s deteriorating health, made a report to the local sheriff’s office on October 11th. A search for Edgar Walker began shortly after.

Unfortunately, Mr. Walker’s body was found inside his cabin with his head crushed by a shovel. The primary suspect is his wife, Isla Walker, who has gone missing this week. It is believed she has fled the area.

A funeral will be held for Mr. Walker on October 17th. He has already been buried outside of the cabin that he prized so dearly. He will be missed by the residents of \[Redacted\].

There were accounts of residents in all nearby towns becoming “sick” and murdering their family, running away, or becoming insane. I looked up at the man after finishing the last report he handed me. “There isn’t just one, Mr. Bergmann, they’re all over the world. They bore into the minds of their victims like parasites infesting their hosts. The victim loses their ability to reason and they become consumed by whatever goal they are given by their new master. We need your help, before more people die.

“Mr. Bergmann, will you help us?”

I leaned back against the wall. I thought about Isla and Edgar. It may seem bizarre but I felt close to them. After reading months of someone’s life, you would feel close to anyone and Isla had gone through the same terrifying experience as me. To think that there have been hundreds… No, thousands... Of people who have become victims of Amarantus was unbearable.

I took a deep breath, “I don’t want anyone else to go through what I’ve gone through. I’ll help you.”

“Fantastic news, Mr. Bergmann, I look forward to your cooperation,” the man said with a bow as he stood, [“you can call me, Dr. Olsen.”](https://williamroseberry.com/short-stories/crystal-lake-cabin#part3)

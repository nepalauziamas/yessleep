It was mid-summer when the issues started. 

“You should pluck those unsightly hairs out of your cheeks. They make you look weird.”

I remember waking up that morning with a god awful headache, my ears feeling like they’d been pounded with rusty nails and congested to the high heavens. I assumed covid or maybe the flu had finally caught up to my introverted ass, but I had a day of work ahead of me and I couldn’t just stay in bed all day. 

When the voice rang out in my ear, I was startled and damn near fell over in my bathroom. An inner monologue is one thing, sure, but to have an actual tangible voice ripple through my ears was terrifying. I assumed someone had snuck up behind me and was speaking directly into my ear. But as I whipped around, I saw nobody.

“What the fuck…” I breathed, pulse pounding and heart in my throat. “Did I just imagine that?”

“No, you didn’t. I’m in your head, idiot. You knew this was coming, right?” The voice chuckled, every intonation making my eyes throb. “All those years of mental health issues, trips to the psych ward and ex’s telling you that you were always on the edge of crazy… well, you’ve gone and made the jump my friend. Congratulations.” 

I leaned into the sink and felt faint, body on the verge of vomiting as the voices incessant laughter pushed me further. It’s true that I’d had mental health issues most of my life, exacerbated by a really toxic relationship with my ex. I got free, went to therapy and for the last 10 months had been relatively safe and free of issues. 

Now, I seemed to be staring the deepest pit of insanity in the face. 

“This can’t be real. I’m not a schizophrenic, I’ve never shown any signs, and I’d know because I-“

“Because you always googled your symptoms and confided in your doctors, therapists and your ex. Yes, I know. But that doesn’t mean you don’t have it, does it?” A long silence before some trepidation creeped into their voice. “You could try something if you don’t believe me?”

“Fine, what?” Sweat poured down my face as the pain radiated through my skull. Even then, I could hear the smile in the voice as it responded.

“Smash your head into the mirror. I’ve heard that if it’s just a bout of mania, you can excise it through sheer willpower. On the bright side, it’ll give you pain. We both know you deserve that anyway, given the horrible ways you’ve treated others. Maybe that will keep… THEM away.”

“Them? What do you mean THEM?”

“I… There’s someone coming after you. The great shadow. It knows where you are and it’s going to come for you if you don’t appease it. You need me. My instructions, to save us. Plus, doing this will ensure you know I’m here to stay. So \*do it\*.”

Over and over again, the voice pushing me to do it. Hands gripping the sides of the sink so hard I thought my tendons would snap, I reared back my head and smashed it into the mirror with every bit of force I could muster. I heard the glass break, the hot blood cascading down my forehead and the mother of all headaches rushing to my eyes and blurring my vision. 

“And as you can see: I am still here. Now, you will listen to what I have to say, or the shadow will come to visit you. Understand? I am here to protect you.”

I stumbled, legs feeling like jelly, and a horrible sense of dread permeating my soul. Looking back, rational me should’ve known to call the hospital, but the voice insisted they’d ignore my protests, lock me up and that’d be the end of it. I had spent time in a psych ward before; I didn’t want that again, so I acquiesced. 

What follows is a series of progressively demeaning remarks and obscene demands over a 3-day period. For the sake of brevity and to avoid being banned, I will not list them in detail here. But they involved eating less or risk bereavement over my weight, acts of self-mutilation to “purge my body of its sins”, sealing my windows in tinfoil to keep out bad signals and constant suggestions of taking my own life. 

Eventually, the pain in my ears was reaching a critical point and my desire to survive was stronger than the voice’s threats at that point. 

“If you disobey me, the looming shadow will come for you in the night. It’ll come for you, tear your flesh from your ungrateful bones and EVERYONE will know what a terrible person you are.” The voice growled, something almost determined in its voice. “I’ll see to it personally.”

But I didn’t care, the pain was far worse than any of the voice’s words and I called the hospital for an emergency appointment. Due to the weekend, they told me to come down in 2 hours as that was the earliest they could find. Satisfied with the result, I resolved to take a short nap until the time came, exhausted from the pain and the constant berating. 

But I found no comfort in my rest. Instead, after letting my eyes rest for a time, I was awoken by the sensation of being watched. My room was pitch black, and I knew it couldn’t have been long since I went to lie down, so it’d still be the middle of the night. Straining my eyes to look forward, I saw something rippling in the hallway. 

“I warned you…” The voice growled in my ear, followed by the most godawful scratching noise I’d ever heard. ASMR turned up to 11 and making my skin crawl. 

But it paled in comparison to what I was making out in the darkness. 

The shape of a person. Tall, thick legs like tree trunks and an all-black frame with piercing eyes staring at me, curious, with its head cocked to the side. I don’t know if it was the mania, but its very shape vibrated in place, like a bad signal on a TV. 

Instinct took over, and I hurled the closest thing I had at it; my glass of water. I was never a fighter, but it’s amazing what you’ll do on adrenaline. The glass missed and smashed against the side of the wall; the shape retreating back into the hallway and out of sight as I screamed and leapt to chase after it.

“What the hell are you doing?! The shadow man will- “ The voice hissed as I vaulted over my bed and out of the doorway.

“I don’t give a fuck what you say or what it does. I am not doing this anymore!” I bellowed, hurtling down the stairs and towards my hallway, pulling at the door and stepping out into the porch area, breathing in the midnight air and eyes wide with fear. 

Nobody there. 

“Idiot.” The voice remarked with cold indifference. 

“Where are you? Where the fuck are you damnit?!” I screamed as a neighbour looked out of their window with concern, promptly closing the curtains as I met their gaze.

“You’re losing it, honey. They can’t see what you see. They can only see your steady, ugly demise.” The voice cooed, a feeling of both dread and terror once again seeping in to replace anger. “You’re going to get the cops called on you if you don’t put your mask back on. Come on now, you’ve always been so good at the mask!” 

Ugly memories floated to the surface. All the times I had to pretend I hadn’t been crying, suppress my emotions so it didn’t make my ex madder, hiding the bruises and burn marks to make sure I always looked my best. Tears flooded my eyes, and I ran back inside, slamming the door and rushing to my bathroom to take something… ANYTHING to numb the pain in my head and in my ears. 

But the voice was unrelenting. 

“You know… if you took all those pills in your medicine cabinet right now, nobody could stop you. They wouldn’t even find you until it was too late. Just throwing it out there.”

Hands shook as I stood in front of my bathroom mirror, trying to get a grip. I saw myself and felt nothing but disgust: Weatherbeaten skin, unkempt beard and bags under my eyes strong enough to pull my face down like a terrifying droopy impression. Even in my resigned tone as I audibly responded to the voices in my head, it was a caricature of those Debbie downer characters you see in cartoons.

Only I was seriously taking the words in my head into consideration.

“You are not real. Even if you were, people WOULD care and they WOULD find me.” I put some lotion on my face, desperate to get the feeling of rejuvenation back into my flesh. To \*feel\* something other than constant exhaustion and numbness.

“Perhaps they do care, but they’re too busy to check in… isn’t that worse? That they have the capacity to care for you, to cherish you… yet they don’t act on it.” The voice murmured in my ear, a gravelled, mocking tone that reverberated around my skull. “They’ll be sad when you die, sure. Perhaps even a few tears at the funeral. But they’ll move on. The hands of time will turn as they always do, the world will continue to rotate and you will be nothing more than a small black stain in people’s memories. That’s all you are, you know. A black stain. Not a real man, just a spineless little worm. She told you just as much. What was it she said the last time you saw her?” 

“She said… that nobody would ever love me the way she did. They wouldn’t understand my issues, and wouldn't want to deal with me. That I was ugly inside & out. That I…” I paused, looking at my face once more and an ugly, terrifying realisation overcame me.

“Yes? Go on, I want to hear you say it.” The voice hissed. But I was beyond it for the first time since this began. 

“That I was full of parasites just waiting to become one myself. I just needed the right… push. An earworm.” I breathed, the penny dropping and my stomach contracting as what little food I had was brought up into the sink and the pain nearly sending me to my knees. 

I barely remember the next couple of hours, only that I was able to block out the incessant scratching and screaming from the voice long enough to call an ambulance before I succumbed to the pain. 

When I came to, I was sitting upright in a hospital bed with a concerned doctor looking over me, two assisting nurses by her side. 

“Mr. Mullaney? I’m Dr. Somersall, the primary care physician. I’m the one overseeing your care tonight. Now, before we start, I need you to remain calm, okay?” 

I nodded, mouth feeling like it was full of ash. I tried to pull my arm up and felt the resistance around my wrist. Looking down, I saw both were strapped to the sides of the bed before looking up with concern.

“We found you with a self-inflicted wound to your head and a stomach full of pills. This is a necessary precaution to ensure you won’t harm yourself again. Now I want you to be comfortable, but first we need to talk about what happened. Can we do that?” 

I nodded, a feeling of shame overcoming me as she made some notes.

“What made you want to hurt yourself like this? I know we’ve only just met and you’re not likely to tell me much, but-“

“I didn’t do this because I wanted to. I…” Feeling the tears in my eyes, I bit my lip. “You won’t believe me if I tell you.” 

She leaned forward, hand on my wrist. “Try me, no judgement.” 

“There’s a voice in my head telling me to do it. It said if I didn’t behave, the shadow would come for me. It \*did\*, I caught it staring at me while I napped, chased it out of the room.” The doctor’s face betrayed the promise, and I tried to finish before they sedated me. “I know how it sounds, but I realised something before I made the emergency call. If I’m wrong, you can send me away.” 

Her eyes glistened and to my immense relief, she nodded and as I beckoned her to lean in; I whispered the most important words I’d ever spoken in my life:

“Doc… There is something in my fucking ear.” 

She leaned back with a look of confusion before asking the nurse to bring over an otoscope to peer inside my right ear. I was shaking, knowing full well if I was wrong that I wouldn’t see the outside world for a long, long time. As the silence hung over us, I began to question if the voice was right and I truly was a terribly broken person, worthy of the torment I suffered.

Then I heard her gasp and those three words punctured my soul:

“Oh my god.” 

I was numbed and kept still as the instruments were brought in. I felt the scratching in my ear increase and then slowly but surely decrease as the lidocaine did its job. After the cold metallic forceps came in and clamped down, a slow pulling motion was followed by a feeling of immense relief and sounds of abject disgust from the room as they wrenched the little bastard free. I know it was dead, but I swear to you I heard the carapace crunch, the mandibles snap and the little fucker HISS as it was taken from its burrow in my ear canal. Every section of it writhing and flailing as it desperately tried to get back inside. 

I breathed a sigh of relief and in a shaky voice asked what it was.

“It’s an earwig. A big one at that, 2 inches maybe? That thing was in deep, no wonder you felt such discomfort!”

I laughed. A genuine, happy laugh that I hadn’t experienced in a long time. “Yeah, I guess that’d explain the voices too, huh?”

A silence fell over the room once more and I heard hurried footsteps gather around the doctor as she did some fiddling and furtive whispering to her colleagues. 

“Is everything okay? You’ve not found another one, have you?”

“Mr. Mullaney, you said a shadow person visited you in the night?”

“Yeah, they ran off as I chased them. Nothing outside, so I assumed it was part of this whole psychosis experience. Why?” 

“Do you have any enemies? Maybe a bitter ex?”

I paused. This was unexpected, and I didn’t know what to say. She must’ve sensed my trepidation and pressed me again.

“Talk to me, it’ll make this part easier. I need you to keep calm while I inspect deeper into the ear, okay?”

I shrugged and agreed, telling her about my recent ex-partner, who we’ll call “Michelle”. 

We met through an online group where we posted memes, shared thoughts and tried to escape from the hellfire of the world through dark humour. Granted, there were times she’d say things I was unsure were legitimate or not, but overall she was sweet. We met up a few times before deciding to give it a go and when we weren’t spending time with each other; we had regular calls over Discord. Things weren’t too bad at first, but she started getting possessive, telling me I needed to lose more weight to be hot. That I wasn’t a real man because I hated conflict and wouldn’t rise to her taunts. On one night, while making us dinner, I’d accidentally cut my hand while cooking. Blood sprayed across my kitchen countertop as I was writhing in agony while she just watched, a disturbing smile on her face before she broke out into laughter. 

It just escalated from there. Forcing me to do things I didn’t want, cutting me off from old friends and family by convincing me they hated me, exacerbating my mental health and that I was far worse than I actually was. She sapped away every facet of my life until I was a husk of a person. 

Then came the night where I stood up for myself. I came home from work late and saw her in bed with someone else. Despite everything, I was furious, and I demanded they both leave, since it was my home. But she just sat there, laughing in his arms and pointing at me as he joined in.

“What the fuck is a little beta bitch like YOU going to do about it? This is why you’ll die alone without me. You can’t GET anyone else, you’re pathetic. Not a real man like him.” She carried on with him as if I wasn’t there. In my own bed. I felt violated and sick, but for the first time in my life I stood my ground. I grabbed an ornament from the shelf and launched it at the guy’s face, smashing his nose and staining my bedsheets as he rolled around screaming. She froze and looked at me with fury. 

“Who do you think you are?! Get the fuck out before I punish you!” She bellowed, but I took a step forward and saw her recoil like the snake she was. 

“My house, not yours. You have 15 minutes to get your shit and leave, the police will be here either way.” I felt the words escape my lips with cold indifference as her bravado came back. 

“I’ll tell them you assaulted him. Assaulted ME. Then what?” She smirked, comforting her lover. 

Without any hesitation, I smashed my face into the doorway and called the emergency line in a panic, declaring I had a home invasion and they’d assaulted me. They were hauled off without any issue and I still remember her threat as the restraining order was put on her:

“You’ll never be rid of me. I promise.”

As I finished, I heard one of the nurses leave the room and asked where she was going.

“The police. I’ve got good news and bad news, Mr. Mullaney.” She said, taking in a short breath. “The good news is, you won’t be hearing any voices anymore. The bad news…”

I trembled as I felt her unfasten the wrist guards and walk around to me, showing me something on a napkin she’d pulled from my ear.

It was a speaker. A tiny, home-built bluetooth speaker. 

And I knew exactly who it belonged to.

“You weren’t hearing any voices of your own, Mr Mullaney. You were hearing hers.”

You’re probably wondering what did i do.. i (30f) really have no idea.. i started feeling this way 3 years ago.. i was at a my bsf ( kate 30f) house and the 3rd ( Andy28f) of our trio came over.. vibes went weird. me and kate picked up on it immediately and gave each other a look as we normally would when something is sus.. this andy is also our close friend so it’s not like shes new.. our families have been in the area for decades so it’s that type of life.. any way she made a comment during the night- it’s was along the lines of she needs a bun to end me.. it was creepy & not the first time .. but this time kate looked at me very worried. Ever since then I’ve kept an eye out for Andy’s  behavior. There’s been occasions where things were clearly set up and she for sure had a hand in it. I can go on about all of that but let’s get back to me being in danger. Anyway i moved & quickly realized i was being watched & followed.. for the past 2 years any time i did something it would brought up in conversation by her .. how would she know- we aren’t in the same state. These people have the means and the money to do this.. they’ve spread lies about me - no one wants me around Im damaged to others.. as I’m typing this my phone is glitching bc it’s been hacked .. every new phone i get it’s hacked. Awhile   ago a bounty was put on me.. I’ve know for awhile but this past week a real attempt to take me happened.  The people who want me dead, the family, the cops secretly protecting me; they all think i don’t know but i do.. right now I’m i hiding in a hotel in a state i don’t know.tonight i ran into both a detective and one of the men attempting to kill me .. most tense elevator ride… I’m in my room ready for war; I’m scared - if i don’t make it i love you..

2 reason i think this is happening: 
1- she & her family think i sold out their cousin. I didn’t it was a lie. No one ever asked me everyone just believed the rumors. It damaged me & my families rep.. everything was placed on me.. its a nightmare. 

2- i fell in love with the wrong person.. and he loved me back.. his ties to the community make it impossible for us to be together.. no one wants us together and they will make sure of it.. 

This same issue happened in our past life and i gave myself up as sacrifice for the fighting to stop .. i thought me running away would help this time but it doesn’t.. so here we are again.. me fighting for my life and him never being able to be with the one he loves...

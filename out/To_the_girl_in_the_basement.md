Growing up there wasn't a whole lot to do in the huge Victorian house my parents bought yet never cared for. From spider webs to dust bunnies, I had all the more companions I could have. Something I never experienced was music, there were no TV, there were no radios, it was always pale air. 

Almost as if filling it with a piano in the study could illuminate this place, despite its inch layer in dust, who knew it might just frazzle the dust into moving away. If only..

There was one sound, that ruined it all. 
The very sound I wish I never investigated, I probably would still have my life.

Of course, investigation is a must for little me. I explored every time. Every time I would end up to the floor over the kitchen. A soft- what I could assume- melody would spring in chunks from the old floorboards. Almost like a hmm and a whistle, to me it was like music. I would dance to it almost, swaying to what to me was the most fun that I could possibly have in that old house.

Till one day, when my world caved in on itself. In many ways than one. My foot falling through the floor boards of the kitchen was not an ideal thing. For what I saw wasn't to be seen. 

Fearfully I scatter from the hole, yet the sound is louder. Drawing me in, I almost crawl back to the kitchen, on my stomach I clean the floor with my clothes as I slide my way over to the hole. 

My eyes meet a pair eyes, it was enough to make my blood freeze. "Hi." Says that which spoke back to me. Broken and scratch it was clear as day; I can hear it replay in my ears as I speak. It was feminine for sure. I wish I could have looked longer but that wouldn't have been good for me. I know I did the right thing.

Running to the phone felt like it was the farthest distance from the kitchen to the second living room it was a run for my body at the time. 

Dialing 911 frantically as if a murder was out to get me though the fear of the hole was not what I should have been worried about.

The operator told me to get out of the house, even when I was bawling my eyes out I managed to move over to a closet. I felt outside was no better in my head at the time.

I stayed in their for hours. Before I was found, I was told nothing. 

But what I heard; was that there was a little girl and multiple bodies in the basement. My parents who were upstairs to my surprise, were taken away with a fight, all you could hear were screams and tussles of who I thought were my parents. 

I wish I hadn't hidden where I did, not knowing anything would have lessen my nightmares.

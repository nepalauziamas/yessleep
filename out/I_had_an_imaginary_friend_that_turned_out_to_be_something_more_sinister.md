When I was young, I had this imaginary friend I called Vlado (it is a nickname in Slavic region of Balkans to people named Vladimir). The most weird thing was that I actually remember him. He was old, not to old old, but in his 50/60. Nothing special about him , except a weird thing he always did with his hand. When he was showing me something he always pointed it out with his right arm, because his left arm was twitching all the time. It didn't worry me when I was little, but now that I think of it , it is a bit creepy.

Vlado disappeared sometime around my 9th birthday (yes it is strange to have an imaginary friend for that long) but I don't really remember my reaction to his absence. He wasn't a big part of my life, he was always there but never did anything crazy, I would sometimes chat with him, or he would show me something interesting. One time he made a chicken blow up (like in cartoons) my parents noticed the feathers on the ground and that one chicken was missing. I just simply told them it was Vlado's doing and us two just laughed it off.

Well, since my 9th birthday 12 years passed. My younger brother was turning 18 so we had this celebration at our house. Friends and family were invited to the celebration so it got crowded real quick. One family in particular that was friends with my family brought a 3 year old girl we saw first time since she was born (since we were in separate countries for more than that). She was an interesting child, I usually hated children but this one was fine. 

Well , what followed after, couldn't be called fine. At some point I had to go to the bathroom. On my way to the bathroom I saw that the girl ( we will call her Anya) seemed to be playing with someone, or something that I didn't see. "How is it going, having fun?" I asked , the girl turned with a smile " Yeah , I just heard the story when the chicken blew up , it's so funny " she said and giggled. I was stunned, how did she know about that? From who did she hear the story?. I decided I am gonna disregard it as coincidence and just smiled "Yeah that was funny" I said and went in to the bathroom.

I almost forgot about it all till the end of the party, but then the little girl approached me and hugged me. Both my parents and her parents thought it was cute , until she said "You know Vlado is angry at you?" and bit into my arm. Her mother reached out for her and pulled her off of me. My parents were confused and the parents of Anya started to apologize over and over. I just said its fine and that she maybe just wanted to play. Then Anya's father all of a sudden remembering what she said, asked " who is Vlado".

I didn't know what to answer so I just said " I don't know really". Then Anya said with a raised tone "Yes you do, don't be scared, nothing to be afraid in the dark" then my spine shivered , "don't be scared nothing to be afraid in the dark" was something Vlado used to say every time he wanted to show me something in the dark and I said I was scared. Thankfully Anya's parents picked her up and said "enough with the playing , time to go home" and they left. 

My mother looked worried , after cleaning my wound she asked me " Didn't you have an imaginary friend Vlado when you were young?" I pretended to think and then answer "I'm not sure, I don't really remember". We both agreed there was something weird but didn't think much of it. The next few days were calm and we almost forgot all about the incident on that day .>!\*Phone Rings\*.!<

My mum picked up the phone and answered "Hello" . I immediately heard someone talking in a panicked voice over the phone, my mum had this weird look on her face and then looked at me. "Are you sure your imaginary friend wasn't called Vlado?" she asked with a straight face. I didn't want to scare them but I heard that Anya's mother is already worried enough. "I think it was Vlado, yeah , now that I think of it better it was Vlado". My mom looked down to the floor and kept on listening to Anya's mother. After a while she asked me "How did he look? Do you remember at all?" 

I didn't want to lie anymore so I explained everything , even the part with the twitching arm. I heard Anya's mother almost starting to cry. My mom calmed her down and said we are on the way to them to see what is happening there. My mom didn't let me drive, she was going really fast. "I need you there in order to identify the malicious spirit" she said , "as his first host , or previous host you will be able to sense him , maybe even see him, in some cases even talk to him" I was just nodding my head like it was something normal. My mother did know some witchcraft (only "white magic"). 

"You will have to resist him at all costs, you will have to show me where he is so I can get rid of him, don't give in to his jokes or his joyfulness it is a trick. Anya can't tell us because she is a kid and he already got her in his grip, if he tells her to keep his location secret, she will" I never heard my mom talk so fast but I just kept nodding.

Few minutes later we arrived to the house, it was somewhere around midnight, all the lights in the house were on. But in one room in particular they were flickering. Me and my mum rushed in to the house. We heard a child's giggle which was probably Anya and the rest of her family crying almost like lunatics. My mom came in to the room and immediately shouted something that I didn't understand. It seemed to work because Anya all of a sudden snapped out of the frantic laughter she was in, looked around for few seconds but then dozed off again and started laughing. 

My mom looked like she didn't expect this , then I remembered why I was there. As soon as the thought crossed my mind I felt light-headed. I heard this familiar voice, voice of Vlado. For some reason I wasn't spooked, I wanted to laugh but I don't know why. Vlado's voice became more understandable , and he started to tell me a joke, I started giggling even before he finished the joke. 

"Snap out of it" I heard my mom yell and shake me holding my shoulder. "Why would you snap out of it , it is fun, not what reality has to offer" I heard Vlado's voice " I can help you avoid it , I can be there for you , or I can make it all go away" he said in sort of a creepy voice at this point. That's when I remembered what I was there for once again. 

I all of a sudden started losing the voice of Vlado, and my head seemed to be fine. I did still see him , I pointed at the location where he was just standing in shock, probably because of what happened. My mom took a quick look then closed here eyes and seemed to focus, all of a sudden close to Vlado a light appeared , he didn't see it in time so he got touched by it before jumping away from it. A hole appeared in his torso where the light touched him. "Did I get him" I heard my mom ask.

" A bit to the right" I said fast, as I saw he was inspecting his wound, this time the ball of light appeared right inside of Vlado, he started screaming but I heard no sound , he was being vanished by the light, the more it consumed him the more it grew. Until the only thing I saw was a big ball of light, my mom kept her eyes closed and focused. "He is gone" I said after I lost the creepy feeling I realized I had when near him. We turned around to see the family, including Anya tightly seated on the couch look at us stressed out. "Is it over" asked Anya "is the twitchy man gone?".

I nodded my head to her and she jumped from the bed and came to hug me. I wasn't afraid of the bite this time because I knew it was Vlado before telling her to do so. "Sorry I bit you, Vlado made me do it" I just laughed and said its fine. Few days passed after that until my mom told me what Vlado is actually.

It's an entity that inhabits bodies of young children because they are easily manipulated into doing what he wants. She explained to me that she knew all along about Vlado when I was young but didn't do anything because she didn't know the spell with which these entities are exposed of. She did keep a shield hex around me , that's why Vlado didn't manipulate me that easily, he stayed with me because he didn't have anywhere to go. When I turned 9 he left because that is the age that people become immune to these sort of spirits. The soul is too formed at that point and can't be inhabited by a weak spirit like the "child-leeches" as my mother called them.

He probably stayed in the house, leeching to anything he can in order to survive, and when a child came he inhabited the host . To answer what would have happened if we didn't stop him , my mother just sighed and said "Well our friends wouldn't be alive anymore, and Vlado would turn in to god knows what".

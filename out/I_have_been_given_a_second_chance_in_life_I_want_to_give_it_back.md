I hear them walking, they are looking for me. I don't have much time before I will need to move out or they will find me, I hope that someone here can help me. I want to die so this can finally stop but I can't. Everytime I try I fail, the bullet always misses or jums even when I have the gun next to my head it never makes contact. Two years ago I was a normal person. I  had a job, a girlfriend, friends, family everything I really wanted and needed even if I thought otherwise. Two years ago I died and I should have stayed dead. It was a normal day. I was coming back from work dreaming of a hot bath and my bed. Such simple but enjoyable things so enjoyable in fact that I didn't see the car approaching me. I was blinded by the headlights and felt the impact, the pain lasted for only a few seconds but it was agonizing. I was dazed, my vision  constantly switching from clear to blurry.


That's when I saw him, a  man around his 40s stood before me. His form was crystal clear even when everything else was a mix of shapes and colors dancing around. He wore a red suit with a black tie. He looked at me for a while and then spoke 'so are you still aware' I tried to nod but I couldn't move, still he seemed to know I was. I wanted to say to him that I needed help to call an ambulance but only a whisper came out of my mouth. To my surprise he responded ' I am not sure they can do much at your state I on the other hand… he posed as if thinking of the right words to say' I could help fix this little mess ' he said.' It won't be for free though' I felt a chill ran  down  my spine 'no don't worry I don't want your soul or anything just your service for your remaining lifetime maybe one or two decades after that. 


I looked at him and not sure what he was talking about, ' you better choose quickly' he said. As if on cue the colors around me started to deem and disappear. I agreed with another nod then he got closer. Looking back now I never saw his face. it was  blurred no it was more like my brain  refused to perceive it. I woke up on a hospital bed when I tried to move. I realized I felt no pain I got up and looked at myself. I was bandaged but when I took them off I only had some scars. The doctors and the nurses were dumbfounded.I only got there two days ago almost dead but now I was completely fine. no injuries were left and my legs which had been broken until last night were now completely fine. They  agreed to let me go after some tests to be sure I was fine and see what exactly happened. 


It was at the last test that everything went to hell. It was a blood test, I was never afraid of needles but that day I was a little paranoid..  still I never could have imagined what happened when the needle pierced my skin I grabbed the doctors arm and snapped it just like that he screamed I did too , my body just moved on its own. The doctor tried to run. I washed upon him within seconds. I snapped his necks with such ease it was terrifying . The nurse who was there screamed  that she took some kind of syringe and stabbed me with it. I felt the liquid getting inside my blood and then I felt it going out again. she tried to push it back inside it was hopeless. The rest is a blur. I remember running, I remember going home and falling to the floor crying trying to make sense of it all. 


I remember the police showing up two officers, I remember their screams as they shot not a single bullet bit me as charged towards them. I tried to shoot myself the weapon jumed I tried again same thing and again and again. I went to my kitchen grabbed a knife and tried to cut my throat, nothing not a scratch the blade broke into shards. Then I saw the man again now he was accompanied by six figures wearing black cloaks. He told me it was time. I ran, the men followed me even with my monsterus speed they kept up with me. I hide at a cabin my family used for vacations. I have done everything I can think of to kill myself but it never work I jumped in front of cars they always stopped in time, I took so many pills that it would be enough to kill me twice, I haven't eaten for ten days now still nothing I don't feel any hunger. They will find me here soon the always do if anyone reads this please I need help.

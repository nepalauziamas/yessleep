 

I was hiking one day with my girlfriend Melissa, we were laughing and smiling until…

TRIP!

“Oh my god! Reese, are you okay?” Melissa exclaimed. She grabbed my hand to help me up and as I got up I saw a book. 

I picked it up and it felt like a leather diary.

“Reese? What are you doing?! Put that down!” Melissa yelled as she punched the diary out of my hands. “Let’s go!” She grabbed my hand and pulled me away. 

Sweat trickled down my love’s head and she was shaking. We ended up at a cabin I built a few months back and she was tired and said she would take a nap.

I couldn’t stop thinking about the diary, my mind was racing. It was 7 pm and Melissa was still sleeping.

I walked to the trail where the diary was and I picked it up and dusted it off. 

*If you are reading this, I am dead.* Huh? *Look, you need to get out of here. These woods are… let’s just say, creepy.* Nah, is this a joke? *There are things in the forest I can’t explain but long story short there is… there is… oh my gosh I cannot explain it. It’s like long and scary and black.* Black? 💀 *It probably took me by the time you are reading this.* What is “it?”

“Reese! Can I get cuddles please…” Melissa exclaimed. Melissa was sleeping while I cuddled her. I slowly pulled out the diary and continued reading.

*At midnight, that “thing” will emerge and kill every human in sight. It killed me. I am writing in this as the “thing” is emerging. It will kill you, you need to get out of the woods before midnight. If you do not escape, it will spread your blood and guts all over its home.*

DRIP!

DRIP!   
DRIP! 

I turn on the lights and I fall on my butt. I see brain matter and blood everywhere and the worst part?

The bed is empty… I called out Melissa’s name but no response. 

“MELISSA!!”

…

“MELISSA!!!”

…

Knock...

Knock…

KNOCK…

KNOCK…

KNOCK!! 

KNOCK!!!

KNOCK!!!!

“It will spread your guts all over **its home.**” The words echoed in my head. I read the diary further as “thing” was banging on the door.

*You will die. There is no survival rate. It’s 0. There is no way to beat this as an average human unless you escape but you can't escape and it will catch you. But I am not average, I did karate for 2 years.* This is not the time to mention this OP! Tell me how to kill this thing! *All you need to do is run. Run until you see an entrance, then you will be safe. But I didn’t succeed so I may be lying.*

The door burst open and I see it. It was exactly as the writer described it. Long, scary and black. Its color was dark and like nothing. It was thin and at least 7 feet tall. It has white round eyes and looks malnourished. It was like Shy Guy but it was black instead of white and it had a standard jaw.

The monster charged at me and I dodged it. I ran out the door and started running. 

Step.

Step.

Step.

Step.

Step.

As I reached the entrance I saw a set of eyes that were familiar.

“Hello, Reese…”

It hovered his hand over my head. Suddenly, it felt like something slammed into me. I looked at it and it was…

Melissa.

She was dead. 

“YOU MONSTER!” I screamed as I swung at it. Surprisingly, it fell to the ground and it was spewing blood everywhere. I got up quickly and tried to run but I slipped on its blood and fell to the floor.

CRACK!

I just broke my ankle! I crawled away while the monster screamed. Thankful a midnight jogger found me and got me to the hospital. I explained to them what I saw but the nurses and doctor laughed like I just told a funny joke.  
“Stop lying. You just tripped, right?” The male doctor said.

“You shouldn’t lie to medical professionals, if you do we can’t help you.” A nurse added.

“But I’m not lying!” I exclaimed. “Read the diary!” I gave them the leather diary soaked in blood.

The nurse shrugged her shoulders and put it in a ziplock bag. “Wait! Aren’t you going to read it?” I shouted.

“No.” The nurse deadpanned. “Rogers, this is the funniest troll I’d ever seen. This beats the Karen who was fake seizing last week.” 

I sighed and buried my face deep into my pillow until something slowly approached my room… at least I thought it did.

I looked up but nothing was there. What the hell?

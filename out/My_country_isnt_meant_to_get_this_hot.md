*“Stay indoors with the windows closed and the curtains drawn, drink plenty of water, avoid the sunlight, check in on vulnerable relatives and above all else: try to keep cool.”*

A red alert went out over the weekend advising us of what to do since my country really isn’t used to these kinds of heatwaves with temperatures originally predicted to exceed 39c (100f) and as of right now is still climbing. I know many Americans and Australians will scoff at that, saying it’s “not even that bad”, but you have to understand my country isn’t really equipped to handle that kind of weather, even for a few days. 98% of homes are not equipped with A/C and our infrastructure as a whole isn’t really there to manage it. We’re a relatively mild to cold nation and this… this is already not good. 

So, I did what any responsible person would do and stayed at home, making sure to cover all my windows with blackout blinds and stock up reasonably on water, looking to wait it out. I figured I’d spend a few days sweating indoors with the bladeless fan on, play some video games and try to focus on other things. I thought documenting my expeirences may help to beat the heat. You know what they say; "Out of sight out of mind." I admit, I kept one window curtain only slightly drawn so I could look out into the countryside. I had such a beautiful view and so long as I wasn’t catching the main rays, I didn’t see the harm. But, as the day was creeping on, I realised very quickly something was very, very wrong. 

I’m not one for watching regular TV, but I do keep track of the news through my phone like most people. I got a push notification around 3pm on the first day of the heatwave that stirred me from a heat induced nap. I’d been leaning back in my leather recliner, clammy skin clinging to the leather like sticky paper and every part of me feeling hotter than it had done earlier. 

“The fuck? It should be at least a stable temperature now it’s the afternoon…” I grumbled, reaching for my water bottle and looking at the push notification:

**“BREAKING: ALL TIME HEAT RECORD BROKEN, FIRES BREAKING OUT ACROSS THE CAPITOL, WATER RATIONING NOW IN PLACE. DO NOT GO OUTSIDE.”** 

I clicked the notification and cast to my TV as I checked the local temperature. I almost choked on my water when I saw the number:

*“42c (108f) being currently recorded.”*

The air felt thicker just seeing that and the video loaded with some commotion going on in the background, people jumping around and holding their hands up like weirdos. Nasty sunburns across their skin and one of them dropped to the floor likely from heatstroke before being hastily pulled off screen. In the centre shot stood a young woman with no protection from the harsh rays as she held a thermometer with shaking hands, smoke practically rising from something around her.

When she spoke, her voice was coarse as if the throat had been packed with sand. 

*“…and as you can see, everyone at home, we’ve just reached a new record temperature here in the UK! The previous 2019 record has been smashed and this looks to continue for a few days yet. Experts predict thousands could die in this unprecedented heatwave, isn’t it wonderful? Sol confidere and it’s back to you!”*

I did a double take in my recliner, leaning forward as my back burned and rewinding the broadcast. I took a better look at her as the makeup ran down her face, hair matted to her forehead and the business casual outfit clinging to her in what must have been a terribly constricting manner. But then I saw her expression and something in it unsettled me even more than her words. She was elated, eyes twitching and almost bubbling in the scorching heat as those uncanny words repeated again:

*“Isn’t it wonderful?”*

I thought the poor girl had heatstroke and mentally begged the producers got her some immediate attention as the broadcast continued in the background, my mind so frazzled from the heat that I could barely think straight. I was tempted to grab a shower, but I remembered the rationing and thought I’m better off in front of the fan where it’s at least semi-cooler. I’ve famously never done well with the heat and I didn’t want to spend the evening with my head in the toilet. So, I grabbed my laptop and tried to socialise with friends to see how they were beating the heat. You know what they say, strength and solidarity in numbers. Especially when suffering together. 

First one I hit up was my buddy Andy, a friend in Ireland to see how he was getting on.

*“How’re you getting on Mo Chara, staying cool or practicing your jiu jitsu like a madman?”*

*“Adhradh an solas!”*

 I don’t speak Gaelic, so I wasn’t sure what that meant and further messages yielded nothing. I put it down to their partner maybe pulling a weird prank or they were so addled by the heat they simply told me to fuck off in their native tongue. But when I tried calling my Mum, it was a garbled mess on the other side. The heat my phone was generating was enough to singe my ears, but I pushed through to try and understand what she was saying.

*“Mum, you okay? Have you been drinking plenty of water?”*

*“….The….Sun…”* 

*“The sun? Yeah, it’s really hot, make sure you’re indoors. No helping out in the garden, you know you’re getting on in years.”*

*“Honour… The… Sun…”* 

My hand instinctively dropped the phone as the feeling of skin boiling overwhelmed me and as I did, the damn thing smashed on my wood floor, terminating the call. Naturally, I jerked forward to grab it and I realised just how bad things were.

The pain started in my shoulders and rapidly descended down my back before spreading to my arms. It was my skin, it’d began fusing to the leather and the strain of pulling against it felt like someone was flaying my skin. I screamed and the dehydration ripped at my throat to add a further agony. Slumping back, eyes glazing over and a combination of pain and heat exhaustion began to set in, I cast my eyes out the window for something to distract me.

It felt like the air was swirling around outside. Infrastructure that should be stable began dancing and the very road itself twisted, bubbled and smoked. It was almost hypnotic in nature, captivating me. I don’t know how long I’d been staring before I spied someone had begun to walk down the street wearing absolutely nothing. Every step took more off of their delicate flesh and small red and pink splotches littered the asphalt as they stood perpendicular to my window, staring up at me with a bright red face and that same grin the newscaster had. 

In that moment, terror took the place of fear within me and I was rooted to the spot. Something was definitely wrong with him. Slowly, methodically, purposefully, they lifted their arms above their head and arced the fingers into a crown as the eyes shot up towards the overbearing sun overhead, their chapped and torn lips mouthing those familiar words as what I think were tears fell down their face:

*“Worship the conflagration.”* 

The man grinned and I watched his lips fleck and fall off, his cheeks blistering and popping, but his dedication never once wavering as he pulled his head down to look at me once more, jerking his head back as if to invite me out. 

His eyes… his poor eyes had been blinded, melted by the beauty of what he saw above him. Two thick milky fluids cascaded down his cheeks and matted in his moustache. I wretched, but I had to look. I needed to see what drove him to this. 

My eyes began travelling up past his steadily burning, melting frame and towards that beautiful burning god in the sky enriching us with its loving heat. I began to glimpse its form in the sky and I honestly felt every inch of pain, exhaustion and trepidation ebb away. It didn’t even look like the sun, not the one we grew up with at least. It’s… hard to describe, but it was a form full of comfort. The colour of the sky a beautiful pallet of maroon, garnet, crimson and vermillion. So much red, I’d never been happier to be in its presence. 

I don’t know how long I sat there looking, but my head span after a while and ultimately, I succumbed to exhaustion and woke up a half hour ago with a clearer head in a frenzied thirst and a panic. I reached for the water on my side table, but drinking from it brought me no comfort. I may as well have been slurping gravel. I spat it out and somehow managed to reach my phone without causing myself any more pain. 

**NEWS NOTIFICATIONS:** 

**“STATE OF EMERGENCY DECLARED - 3H AGO”**

**“LONDON ABLAZE WITH CLEANSING FIRE - 2H AGO”**

**“BE THANKFUL FOR SOL, SAYS PM - 1H AGO”**

**MISSED CALLS:** 

**MUM (28)**

**ANDY (17)** 

**UNKNOWN (9)** 

Sweat dripped down my forehead and the panic increased. While I was able to read what was on the screen, it wouldn’t respond to commands to make calls and the damn thing was still too hot to hold for more than a minute. I tried in vain to click the voicemail function before putting it by my table to let it load. Turning on the TV, it flickered to life and I realised it must have still been on the news channel as I recognised the banner at the bottom. 

It was a livestream of the sun. The temperature still registered 42c even as the day had now gotten later in the day. I could barely believe it. The garbled voices through my television seemed to be revelling in the madness, overjoyed we were all burning and that it was going to be even hotter tomorrow. It made my head spin... I decided to turn back to the window for comfort. My sole refuge in this sweltering environment. 

The man in the street is gone, a small pool of something left in his spot, but nothing more. Looking around, every house was practically dancing in its spot, moving to a rhythmic beat only they could hear. In a couple of partially covered windows, I could spy my neighbours prostrating themselves before the sun, screaming in its direction amid faces mixed with agony and ecstasy. It was unsettling. I didn't dare look up at the sky again. Not yet, I don't think i'd be able to break away,. 

The TV abruptly shutting off with a loud pop snapped me from my stupour and I began to hear the voicemails crackle through my dessicated phone:

All of them telling me to come outside and bask in the flames.  

My mind is now racing with thoughts of what had occurred and a desire to share with the wider world. My rational mind knows we should not be this hot at all, let alone for this prolonged period of time. I don’t wanna hear from the uneducated climate deniers either, you idiots would call it fake news even as your flesh melted into the ground. SOMEONE has to know why this isn’t stopping. My head is still spinning and my situation isn’t going to get better if I stay in the chair. It’s going to be even hotter tomorrow, too, how am I supposed to handle this for another 30 hours? 

All I can do is rest and hope tomorrow brings some comfort, maybe it won't be so bad?

I've sent my mum a message on the laptop in between documenting this, hoping someone sees i'm in a bind and helps. All I have is time. 

Wish me luck.

Why did we stop drawing the sun with a face? Look back through human history and for centuries, we drew it with an almost regal appearance as it bore down upon us, shining humanity with the necessary light we needed to function. Like a loving parent gifting its child with nourishment. We recorded odd events involving it as if documenting the suns descent into bouts of madness: The 1561 phenomenon in Nuremburg that split the Sun in twain, dividing itself or the 1566 phenomenon in Basel that saw the sky fractured as the sun fought amongst itself to the horror of a far more simple era of man. 

They thought it apocalyptic, the end times and a sign of the terrors to come. They didn't understand the sun was simply preparing itself, growing and masticating until it was ready to reveal itself to a moer enlightened age. 

Us.

I looked out the window, the curtain fully drawn back and I stared up at the broad strokes of red and yellow across the sky. 

I saw it. It saw me. 

Our sun has a face. A beautiful face that is permanently stuck between total ecstacy and that of apopletic rage. It's so close that I can make out the sun spots rising and bursting from its amber surface, thousands of small human-like shapes ascending to meet it. 

My mothers voice rings out over the voicemail function. No longer saying to come outside or honour the sun. She says she's been trying to reach me and is terrified I have heatstroke, that I'm not completely stuck to my chair and I've got to drink some water. Fool, she has no idea, she must be addled and hiding from the suns brilliance. I do not need water or distractions, the warm glow of the sun is all I need. 

I don't know what the man stood outside my house thought, but I know he experienced divinity. 

And I want to experience it too. Maybe, after reading this, some of you will as well. 

Now, I’m going to free myself from this leathery prison even if it tears my flesh to the muscle. I will crawl out of my house if my limbs fail me. 

I will stand in front of that sun. 

And I will praise it.

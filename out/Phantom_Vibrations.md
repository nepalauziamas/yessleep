I can’t keep quiet about this anymore. I just hope that someone will believe me.

I heard about the concept of phantom vibrations a few years ago, but I didn’t hear about it again until recently.

It all started around a month ago. I had no idea what was about to happen. Not just to everyone, but to me.

Before this, I hadn’t thought much about phantom vibrations. After all, I didn’t have any reason to. They weren’t a big deal.

Until one day they were.

One day I was going to work. (It was just at an office, nothing special) Nothing ever happened there, and it was common for people to stay home every other day. My coworkers pretty much hated everyone and everything there, so I didn’t question when one of them didn’t show up. 

They always looked like it was their last day on the job, if that makes any sense. But one day someone didn’t show up for several days. “Maybe they quit?” I thought. No, they disappeared. I saw it on the news. And they weren’t the only one. Several people were already missing. The police were speculating that it was some sort of mass kidnapping. But that was only the beginning.

Fewer and fewer people came into work as the days went on. But one day all of this skyrocketed into what I would describe as a living nightmare.

One day, when I was driving to work, there was absolutely no traffic. But it doesn’t end there, there weren’t any vehicles on the road anywhere at all. And when I got to work, the whole building was empty. The whole building. No one was there. I called my boss and he wouldn’t answer, and none of my friends or anyone I worked with would answer either.

So I went home and looked around online for any recent news, but no articles had been published for two days, so I went to check the news channel.

When I got to the news channel, it was static. This never happens, but it didn’t occur to me that something was wrong until the signal came back; it was live footage of the news set, and It was empty.

I watched and waited for someone to notice that the camera was still on. (I thought that they had left it on by accident) But suddenly the camera moved to the side and went back to static.

I was confused and went to call my wife. I was relieved for her to answer. She said that similar things had been happening around where she lives, too. (We had a long distance relationship)

She mentioned that her friend thought, before she went missing, that the disappearances had to do with people being tracked through their phones with calls or texts. And that she turned her phone off, but somehow it still vibrated that night. I was freaking out at this point. I wanted to know what was going on.

I started doing research about this concept and ended up finding a blog made by some conspiracy journalist about disappearances related to some kind of ancient folktale.

He referred to the creatures involved as “lure creatures”. He theorized that lure creatures could’ve studied human behavior and figured out an efficient way to lure people: through their phones, specifically through false notifications or as he called them, “phantom vibrations”.

He stated that if it’s true, then the creatures could only imitate the sound of the vibration, not cause vibration or imitate any ring or text tone (yet).

Then he stated that if the people would’ve kept their phones off of silent, and their ringers up, it would’ve been obvious which notifications were real and which ones weren’t.

I dismissed it at first and went to call my wife to talk about it with her, but she wouldn’t answer her phone.

That was when I lost it. I felt alone and was absolutely terrified. No one would respond in any way to any of my texts or calls.

I went and did more research on this theory and prepared myself. Even though I went through all of this preparation, I still wasn’t fully convinced. I mean, it sounded too crazy. They sounded like some kind of nightmare predators, but at this point it made as much sense as everything else that was happening. 

That night I made sure my phone wasn’t on silent and that my ringer was on max volume.

I turned off the lights and got into bed. I was thinking about a lot, but it’s all a blur. I was nervous. I wondered what was happening to everyone, and if it was going to happen to me. I wanted to know why everyone was disappearing; why everyone was gone.

Hours of silence went by as I watched my phone laying on the bedside drawers. I could barely see, but I knew nothing was happening.

I was on edge. It was quiet and nothing was happening. I was all alone with those terrifying concepts in my mind. I still wasn’t sure if they were actually true, but I couldn’t think of any other reason why this was happening.

Then I heard the floorboards creak. I looked around and saw nothing. I was so paranoid. Everything felt like a threat.

Even more hours went by and I was so tired. My mind felt numb at that point. The room looked even darker somehow and my eyelids felt heavy.

As I closed my eyes a heard my phone vibrate.

I was going to reach for it, but then my eyes shot open. I saw my phone sitting where it was. I froze in place and glanced around the room.

The room had a fullness to it, it’s difficult to describe. I didn’t feel alone anymore.

I was too scared to move. I couldn’t see anything, but I’m almost certain that I heard breathing that night.

After that, I moved. I couldn’t stay in that house. I couldn’t stay in that town. I even speculated if I should leave the country or not.

My life was never the same after this.

I know this sounds literally impossible, but maybe some of you guys will believe me. This has been eating me from the inside out. I just had to get this out there.

At least some of you have to know something about this. I just want to know where these people went, and if my wife is okay.

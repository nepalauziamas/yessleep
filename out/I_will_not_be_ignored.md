 Sophie, if you’re out there, if you’re seeing this right now, please, *please* just read it. I need you to understand, before I run out of time.

The day I met you, my life changed forever. It was more than love at first sight, so much more. My love for you is not so superficial, no, I value more than just your looks. It was not love at first sight; it was an earth-shattering realisation that you were meant for me. Soulmate felt too strong a word for me before you, especially with the number of disloyal girls out there, but it fits. My darling, it fits so perfectly. 

You always looked so pretty when you thought no one was looking. So natural, perfect without the need for makeup or a false front. Just you. No filter. I could say you are at your best when no one is looking. Except me, of course. But you can forgive that. It’s *me*, after all. I’m the only person in this godforsaken city that won’t hurt you. I protect you. I would give my life for you.

It was hard to approach you. You remember that day at the diner? I was a stranger in your eyes, but I knew everything about you, Sophie. Your full name, the company you worked at, every pet you’ve ever owned, the smell of the shampoo you used. All of it. It’s okay. You are meant to be mine; I *should* know all these things.

Still, I was surprised you spoke to me first. My love, you looked so beautiful that night. And you were so funny, so charming. I almost cried at the sound of your voice; it was that perfect. Better still, you were interested. You wanted me too. I could see it in your eyes, Sophie, they’ve always given you away. Them, and the smile you wore all the way home. The smile you wore as you walked around your apartment, texting your friend about me. I only fell more in love with you.

You had a ex. The two of you had recently broken up. I remember you crying on my shoulder, lamenting how much you missed him. I could have felt jealous, I suppose, but why? He was not right for you. No other man is. I was furious, not envious. How dare you hurt you like that? The one good person left in this city, and he broke your heart? The anger stayed with me long after you fell asleep. It drove me from your apartment to his. It throbbed within me as I let myself in. I didn’t intend for it to be quick and painless, but the adrenaline made me heavy handed. It was an awful mess to clean up, Sophie. But for you, it was worth it.

Don’t worry about me putting this all on the internet. I know the police will see it, but they’re coming anyway. They won’t hold me for long, my love, and I will soon find where they have hidden you and we can be together again. I promise.

I am not angry with you. It hurt that you left, of course, but that pain will go when we’re reunited. Then I can make you see that I only kept you here because nowhere else is safe for someone like you. The world is a dark place, Sophie. Monsters are real people. They will eat a perfect thing like you alive. The restraints were only meant to help you, to keep you safe within the confines of my love. My methods seem harsh but one day, you’ll see them as they truly are. I’ll make you see.

I do have a bone to pick with you, my darling. My letters to you have gone ignored. I know that now they’ve taken you away, you can’t see them, but before? Well, there seems to me no excuse for such callous behaviour. It hurts me. You can atone for that later. I’m sure you want to. 

My time is running out, Sophie, but my plan is falling into place. Give it a few months, a year at most, and then we will be together again. I can be patient if you are, but I can hardly wait for the day that I will make you see. You can read the letters then, if they’ll make you understand. And then you can respond. God knows I’ve been waiting long enough.

I will not be ignored anymore.

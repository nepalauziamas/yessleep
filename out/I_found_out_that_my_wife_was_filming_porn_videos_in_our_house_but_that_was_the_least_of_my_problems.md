“If you want me to watch porn with you, I will!” My wife, Kim reluctantly says to me.

“Only if you want to? If your not into it, then don’t look at it!”

“No, I’ll watch the porn!” Kim says.

“Do you want me to look for something?”

“No, I’ll do it. I don’t want to watch anything weird!”

“Fine, go ahead then!”

Kim clicks on “male and female” from the hundreds of categories that could be chosen.

She scrolls through 20 of the videos that initially comes up and then pushes the next button for 20 more videos to appear.

“Hmm, this video looks familiar!” Kim says to me.

“Let me see!” I watch the video for a few seconds,“ I have no idea who that man or women are!”

“I’m not talking about the man or the woman!” Kim angrily says to me. 

I look closer at the video. “Oh crap! That’s our kitchen!”

“Don’t pull that! Like you didn’t know that was our kitchen!  You said you were going to find ways to make extra money, but you never said that you were going to use our house for porn videos! This is really disgusting!”

“Wait! What? You think I have something to do with this?”

“You thought that I would get off on our house being used as a porn set? Look how that tramp is on our kitchen counter!”

“I see that! But I swear that I had nothing to do with this!”

“I’ve really had enough of you Kevin! I’m going to stay at Cheryl’s house tonight!”

“Wait! I swear I had nothing to do with this!”

“Sure! Bye!”

Then she was gone. I knew that no matter what I said, she was going to leave.

I scratch my head trying to figure out, if it wasn’t one of us who rented out our house, then who was it?”

I watch the video very carefully to see if I can see anything distinguishable about our kitchen, so that I could put a time frame on when the video was taken.

After studying the video, it looks like this video could of been filmed this week based on where the microwave is on the counter, which would make sense because the videos are sorted by the newest releases.

The part that I really can’t figure out is that I work mostly from home and I only go out if one of my client’s businesses is having issues with their land lined phones, which is really infrequent, because most people are working from home now.

I see the sunlight coming in through the window on the porn video, so I Figure that this video had to be filmed on Tuesday, which was the only day I was out of the house.

This is really strange because that would mean that they were sitting and waiting for me to leave the house, which makes no sense.

I can’t see this being the first time that our house was used as a porn set, so I scroll through other videos.

Oh crap! Here’s another one and this time it’s in our bedroom.

Wait! Why the fuck am I in bed, while this man and woman are doing each other? It looks like I’m sleeping.  

I see this title is “wife does friend, while husband sleeps”.

But that’s not my wife, which makes it even odder.  

How the hell did I sleep through this with them being inches away from me?

I study the video closely and for a split second, I see something really unexpected.

Son of a bitch! That’s Kim’s reflection in the mirror of her dresser filming this video.

She must of drugged me! I wonder why I felt like I had  drank two cases of beer the night before, when I didn’t even drink anything.

But why? Why would she go and do something so completely off the wall like this?

I know that my income has been drastically reduced, but I still can’t stop thinking why she would do something like this?

I search the house to see if I can find the hand held camera that she used in the video, but I don’t see it, so I figure that it must be in her car or something.

“That’s real fucked up, what you did Kim!” I text her.

I wait for a response and I don’t get a reply, so I send another text, “How did you even decide to start doing something like this?”

Still no response, so I text her friend Cheryl and write “Hi Cheryl, please tell Kim to respond to me.”

“I haven’t seen her in a couple of days!” Cheryl responds.

Great, another deceitful act!

I feel really emotionally drained, so I go upstairs and rip the blankets off my bed and get new ones from the closet.

I wonder how other spouses dealt with this, so I type into Google “wife filmed pornography in our house, while I received non consensual sedatives.”

Wow with the billions of people on earth this might be the only time something like this has happened, because I’m not finding any advice on Reddit or Quora or any other social media platforms.

Being at my wits end, I decide to just pass out for the night.

It takes me a few minutes to wind down, then my eyelids get heavy and then I’m out.

“Oh Gosh!” I wake up and look at my phone and see that it’s 1:00 am and I have to go downstairs to pee.

I look over and I don’t see Kim on her side of the bed, which makes me sad, because we will be married for 10 years this July and minus this really odd hiccup that happened yesterday, I thought we really loved each other.

I get up out of bed and make my way towards the stairs.

I get a little bit cautious because I see the downstairs light is on, but then my senses get even more heightened when I hear voices coming from downstairs.

“Oh Great! Not another porno shoot!” I softly say to myself at the top of the steps.

I listen for a few minutes then I hear a male voice say “We agreed on $400 a piece on the 9mm’s and $2000 on the AK 47’s!”

“That’s fine, I have the money.”
Another male voice responds.

“Okay, then how many you want?”

“Give me 15 of the AK’s and 20 of the 9mm’s!”

“Ivan get the guns from the van and bring them in here!”

The thought that I accidentally left the television on downstairs quickly fades away, when I hear footsteps coming from the downstairs.

She turned my house into a black market for gun deals!

I really do my best not to make a sound because I’m thinking if any of these people downstairs hear me, then I’m likely dead.

She didn’t have the opportunity to drug me tonight!  That’s why I actually woke up to pee.

As I stand at the top of the stairs, I now realize why I’ve woken up about 5-6 times a week covered in piss, because she was drugging me, however I was convinced that I had a prostate problem or something.

I remain motionless until about 20 minutes later when the footsteps leave the house.

I go downstairs and nothing really looks out of the ordinary, so I would have never realized that this was going on in the house unless if I woke up in the middle of the night.

She’s renting out our house to Arms dealers! This is absolutely terrifying!

Turning our house into a porno set without my consent is bad enough, but the violence associated with gun deals that go wrong is even worse!

How did she find an Arms dealer and how was it worked out that our house would be where the guns would be exchanged? I keep thinking to myself.

I’m sure she’s making money from these business ventures, but why?

I’ve never been so terrified of my own house before.

The odd part is that I have vague memories of what I thought were dreams, where something diabolical was happening downstairs or that strange people were having sex in my bed, but those “dreams” must of been real and I was just having lucid moments from being drugged up.

My mind is now going through other “dreams” I had, which I’m now questioning were they actually dreams or were they real events happening in the house.

In particular, I focus on a “dream” I had, where loud yelling followed by loud “bangs” were heard.

Was there a shooting in my house?

“Oh God!” I say out loud, as the possibility sinks in.

I slowly walk down the steps, because I’m thinking that I’m pretty much dead if someone is still in the house and sees me.

I get to the bottom of the steps and let off a sigh of relief once I realize that everyone has left.  

Kim did some “redecorating” around the house a couple weeks back, so now I’m really suspicious of that.

She put up a gaudy framed print of an eagle in the living room, which catches my attention.  I walk up to the print and I remove it from the wall. 

“What the …” I say, as I see what looks like two bullet holes behind where the print was located.

I really just want to get out of this house now, but I don’t even have a car, because I sold it when we were having financial problems and I was only using it to sporadically drive to see my clients.

Kim’s a social worker at the children’s hospital? I think to myself.

She would always tell me how crazy things were at the hospital and she would be on the phone when she got home from work, so I never questioned her actions.

But who would?

We live in a nice quiet area, where we have a long driveway that’s not visible from the road, which I’m now realizing is a perfect setup for what Kim is doing.

Nobody in this area would ever suspect shady enterprises, like Arms dealings or shooting porno videos would occur in this neighborhood.

But why would Kim make the leap from a social worker to a B&B for wicked enterprises? I can’t stop thinking about and what’s going to come through the door next?

Part of me wants to run out of the house, but where am I going to go?

I’ve never had a contingency plan.  I thought we were struggling a little bit but Kim was making enough money at the “hospital” where I thought we were fine.

I quickly go to the bathroom and then I rush back upstairs to try to piece everything together.

I sit on the bed and second guess everything in our relationship.

For starters, Kim takes care of all of our finances, because she’s the “organized one.”  But I guess I should of questioned why she was always getting raises at work, where she claims that she makes close to $200,000 a year which would be needed to cover our mortgage and other expenses.

But if someone could make that money as a social worker, then why bother going to medical school?

I call the children’s hospital to confirm my suspicions and after getting transferred to a bunch of different departments, I’m finally told that Kimberly Jxxxxsky hasn’t worked in the hospital for over seven years.

I feel like I’m stuck on some kind of macabre island by myself, where I’m surrounded by pirates.

I now have to question everything and anything that has occurred with Kim and I.

We met at a grocery store, where my then 28-year-old loser self was going down the potato chip isle and she asked me to get something on the top shelf that she couldn’t reach.

Then she started talking to me,  where I was really taken aback because she was easily an 8.5 on any guys looks scale and I was about a 4.

That encounter at the grocery store, I now look at as being suspicious, because she referred to me as “being the man of her dreams” where we got married in Vegas within the next month.

She “fell in love” with this house the moment she laid eyes on it, so we bought it.  But now it’s so obvious that she intentionally picked this house because it’s perfect for her business dealings.

I guess the biggest giveaway was her applying for her permanent residency and then her citizenship, which now looking back at it was my biggest contribution “to her business” and not us and our marriage.

She told me that she was from Latvia, but her accent was very minimal, where I would liken her to a chameleon, because she could change her voice to any accent that she heard.

I was the perfect mark for her. I  have no family and my friends are random people that I play Call of Duty with online.

To me, Kim was my wife, but to her, I was the green card and now the nuisance. 

As depressing and heartbreaking it is thinking about “our marriage” I really need to focus on my safety.

Somebody like Kim doesn’t allow herself to be exposed unless she wanted to be exposed. She basically led me to the porno that was shot in our house.  But why? What is her motive for letting me into her dark enterprises?

I feel like I’ve aged 20 years overnight from the stress that Kim has caused me.

The only thing that I can think about is that she wants me to go to the police, so I somehow will incriminate myself, which really worries me because It’s apparent that there was a shooting that occurred downstairs and I wonder if there were any fatalities?

There’s still sunlight outside, so nothing happens when I’m scheduled to be in the house during the day, so I should have time before the next dark business comes into the house.

“Oh crap!” I slap myself on the head, as my naive self realizes that she doesn’t want me to go to the police, but instead she wanted me to walk downstairs last night!

She wanted those Arms dealers to kill me that way she could go to the police and pin everything on me. That makes much more sense considering she has close to two million dollars in a life insurance plan on me, that covers everything from suicide to murder.

As nighttime approaches, I get more and more scared of what will walk through the door.

This is typically the time when Kim cooks for me and unbeknownst to me until now slips me my nightly “sleeping aids”.

I’m really frightened to look around the house, for the fear of what I might uncover, however I reluctantly go to the basement because I don’t know where else she would hide her pills and other stuff.

I walk into the unfinished basement with its concrete walls and concrete floor and I can’t help to think what awful things have happened down here, as I look at the single metal folding chair that’s intentionally placed in the middle of the room.  All I can picture is one or the multiple amount of people that have been tied up in the chair, where their final  moments would be played out.

The floor is covered in what I always thought was dried paint, but now I don’t want to walk near the splotches, because they’re likely dried human fluids.

I carefully make my way to the rusted metal shelving units and I start to open the first of the the ten metal doors.

The first one has nails and miscellaneous tools, like a hammer.

The second one has rope and duct tape that I quickly try to erase from my mind.

The third one has old rags that I push aside and alas reveals pill jars after pill jars of Klonopin, Ativan, Versed and I even see Propofol, that was used to sedate Michael Jackson, which ultimately killed him.

I stop looking through the shelving units and head back upstairs with my head down, knowing that my so called wife has been drugging me.

I figure the best thing for me to do is go to the bedroom and stay there until Kim’s next dark business enterprise comes through the front door.

I’m really hoping that they’re porno actors, because as disgusting as something like that happening in my bed is, at least they’re not dangerous.  But without Kim, who is their director / camerawomen, I would seriously doubt that adult movie stars would come through the front door.

I see that it’s now 10:00 pm and I get more and more nervous with each minute that passes by.

“The Arms dealers didn’t kill me, but what if Kim tells this next group to kill me?” I say to myself out loud, which I can’t stop thinking about.

That’s it! I have plan.

I’m going to douse this house with the gasoline that we have in the shed and turn the oven gas on as well.

When I hear them walking up the steps, I’ll be pretty much out the window, then I’ll ignite the room and fall to the ground outside. 

I quickly run down the stairs and go outside to the shed, where we got 10 gallons of gas when the scare of a possible shortage erupted.

I make two trips to the shed and now I have the gas containers in the house.

I feel really weirded out, pouring gasoline all over my kitchen, living room, dining room and upstairs, but I know Kim’s intent is for me to die, so if I don’t do this then I’m just going to be murdered.

I turn on the gas from the oven before I leave a trail of gasoline to the upstairs.

I douse the 2nd floor, to include my bedroom, with gasoline then I wait by the window that faces the backyard with one foot out the window.

I see that it is now 11:00 pm. I keep my fingers crossed that the smell of the gas doesn’t scare away the would be killers or that the gas doesn’t spontaneously ignite and kill me.

I figure that who ever comes through that front door will be focused on murder, where their adrenaline will ignore the smell of gas.

At 11:20 pm, I hear a car pull up because of the window that is open, that faces the backyard of the house.

I hear multiple footsteps walk through the kitchen, then the dining room, then the living room. 

I hear what sounds like a foreign language being spoken by at least two people with the words “upstairs” mixed in.

I hear the footsteps walking up the steps and I ready the lighter, with the hope that the house doesn’t instantaneously blow up when I use the lighter.

My whole body is tense but I have to keep myself together.

When the first person makes it  up the stairs, I light the gasoline, which immediately turns the room into a ball of fire.

I hear shrieks of horror, as I quickly put my second leg through the window and the second I fall to the ground outside, a large explosion forces me at least 15 yards back.

I black out momentarily, then I check my body to make sure all my limbs are present.

I have a small shard of wood that was impaled in the side of my face.

I’m lucky to be alive, I think to my self as I look at what’s left of my smoldering house.

Fire crews and EMS arrive and they attempt to put the fire out and care to my wounds.

They take me to the hospital and I stick to my story that Kim was downstairs with her “friends” and I heard “fire” so I jumped out the window.

I throw in that “Kim and I recently installed the oven, which might of had a slow leak.”

I meet with the fire chief and a detective, who tell me that the explosion and the fire were so intense that they’re not sure if they’ll recover any remains, but they did tell me that Kim’s car was parked out front.

The most ironic part is that Kim took out the same life insurance plan on herself, so it wouldn’t look suspicious.

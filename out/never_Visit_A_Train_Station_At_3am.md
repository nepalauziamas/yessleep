Splash splish that's how it started as I was walking to the metro station still about five minutes away. The rain falling rhythmically on my umbrella almost synchronized with my heart beat was getting stronger . 
The weather broadcast didn't say anything about this storm. I could have turned back but Mark had already offered me to stay at his house more than once but I denied and I wasn't going to go back now I wouldn't hear the end of it. Looking back now I should have gone back. I guess I wasn't in the best condition ever not only did I had to spent three whole Ours of my life trying to finish a assignment that was due to tomorrow but I may have had drunk one too many drinks. I just wanted to go back home and rest. I looked at my clock 2:30 am great I thought I would have to wait for about an half an hour for the train to come. The station was in front of me. I walked down the stairs and sat on a bench.

I was the only one at the station there should have been someone else there right? I should have turned back then and there buti didn't if I had you wouldn't be reading this right now. 3am I hear the train getting closer it pulls up in front of me I get in from the corner of my eye I see a man walking towards the train. I don't know how I didn't noticed him earlier. He was wearing a brown jacket making it difficult to see his expression he sat three sits away from me and the train started.

 I thought of what would be happening up there I thought about the rain hitting the ground. Splish splash splish splash maybe it was because of my intoxicated state that I didn't realize that the splashing sound wasn't just my imagination. I looked at the man he had a suitcase with him I didn't see it before its brown color blent perfectly with his jacket but know the red liquid dripping from it made it easier to notice. I wanted to think it was something else some kind of red inc maybe but the Cooper smell in the air made it obvious it was blood. Before I could think of what to do next the train stopped at another station another man got in. 

He was young somewhere around his late twenties. When he saw the blood he approached the man asking if everything was Allright. He didn't even had time to say another word before the suitcase made contact with his skull he fell to the ground the man hitting him continuesly I could see his expression it was blank completely blank he was murdering someone and didn't even sow any emotion when he was he opened his suitcase and put bits of fless into it before closing it up again. I stayed there not moving at all he looked at me and then he sat down again. 

  I pretented to not have seen anything out of the ordinary. I didn't know what to do should I run should I stay put and wait for my time to leave the train what if thet maniac attacks me when I try to get out. I stayed there until we reached the next stop I got up only to realize that it wasn't my stop. That place was old and destroyed I don't understand I thought this should have been my stop another man entered the train this time wearing a black jacket with a black suitcase. The same emotionless eyes as before meet my gaze. He sat next to the other man. I wasn't going outside at least not yet I turned back and noticed them staring at me.

I had being trying to keep that same blank expression like them and make a sound but when I looked at them I was caught of guard I was startled my expression sifting to one of surprise they got up and run straight towards me I run to the next cabin and then to the next one. I tried locking the doors but I couldn't I tryed holding the doors shut but the strength they had was unbelievable. So I run every cabin looked different now maybe it was just the shock but I swear they were becoming less saturated. 

The colors looked like they have been washed away and the light became dimmer and dimmer. I felt tired my legs burned. I should have reached the front of the train by now but the cabins seemed infinite. I don't know if that was good or bad. I run as fast as I could the men still following one of them even run at all fours like a wolf.

 The blank stairs still present on their faces. They were behind me I was sure they would catch me when the tain suddenly stopped fell to the ground I got up as fast as I could to see that one of the men the one with the brown jacket had smashed his head on the arm of and the other was till on the ground I grabbed the brown suitcase and hit him until he stopped moving let the suitcase fall to the floor only to see both of them being put back together. It was like they were being remade every little piece being put back together. I run for the exit thankfully I was back at my station I runned home without stoping for any reason other to look behind my back.

 
  So now I am writing this it has been a week since then. I don't know if it only happens here or if it only happens at that time of day but for the love of God be careful if you ever see someone like this men and never visit a tain station at 3am

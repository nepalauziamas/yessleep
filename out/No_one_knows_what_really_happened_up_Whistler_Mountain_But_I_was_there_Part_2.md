[[Part 1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wzqzy7/no_one_knows_what_really_happened_up_whistler/) -- Three bodies found in a remote log cabin, a gun lying beside them that hadn’t been fired. The police, the courts, the local media, all baffled. **But I was there**.

*

The fear is all-consuming. Am I drawing the killer back here by telling my story?

On top of that my vessel fights me for control. But I must persist. I must shine a light on the evil that happened here.

It didn't take Chopper long to drive up the mountain track and arrive. I watched as he parked his van under a tree near the cabin. 

The cabin door was open in a flash.

Rose: "I’m here! I’ve done everything you asked. Please don’t hurt Michael."

Chopper stepped out of the van, a torch in one hand and a gun in the other.

Chopper: "Stop right there, Rose. We need to have a little talk."

Rose: "Oh God, please don’t shoot me. I’ve done everything you told me to do."

Chopper: "The shooter is just a precaution, to make sure you—"

Rose: "Have you shot Michael?"

Chopper: "No, I haven’t shot anyone. I want you to—"

Rose: "Why do you have a van? You said you had a truck?"

Chopper: "Rose, calm down. Don’t worry about what I said on the horn, listen to what I’m saying now. I don’t have Michael."

Rose: "You don't … have …"

Chopper: "No, I don’t have Michael. I just told you I did. I never had a truck neither. It ain’t safe for me to transmit my true situation."

Rose: "So … what's going on? Why are you here?"

Chopper: "All you need to know is that I need a place to lay low for a while."

Rose: "But Michael still isn’t back. He won’t know what’s going on if he sees you with a gun, what if—"

Chopper: "We’ll talk about that soon, Rose. Right now we got work to do."

Rose: "Work? What work?"

Chopper: "We need to cover my minivan up with branches so she’s not visible from the track. Now, start moving towards the minivan, Rose."

Rose: "Okay …"

Chopper: "I want you to lean a few o’ those branches against the minivan to cover her up. If there ain’t enough on the ground, snap some off from those bushes."

She started doing as she was told.

Rose: "You aren't going to help?"

Chopper: "I gotta keep my gun on you, Rose. But, like I said, you do exactly as you’re told and you won’t get hurt."

Rose: "And what if Michael comes back? Will he get hurt?"

Chopper: "No, he won’t. When he comes back you’ll tell him Chopper’s in charge. Then you’ll cuff him to make sure he don’t try any heroics."

Rose: "Handcuff him? With what?"

Chopper tapped his trouser pocket with his torch, there was a dull metallic clink.

Chopper: "The cuffs in my pocket."

Rose: "Why do you have handcuffs in the first place?"

Chopper: "They’re another precaution. Precaution is important in my line o’ work, Rose."

Rose: "And what exactly is your line of work?"

Chopper: "That ain’t something you need to know. Just keep on covering up the minivan, you’re doing a real good job so far."

Rose: "And what if Michael doesn’t come back at all? I told you how worried I am. What if he’s still out there in the dark? What if I need to go out and look for him?"

Chopper: "I've already looked for him, Rose."

Rose: "What?"

Chopper: "Keep working. I didn't say stop."

She did as she was told.

Chopper: "I went looking for Michael after we first spoke. I have a decent map so I knew which way he’d be moving if he was goin’ to Pitwell. There’s only one trail he could take. My plan was to knock him out and toss him in the minivan. Leverage so I could come up here."

Rose: "Let me guess. When you couldn’t find him, you just decided to lie and tell me you had."

Chopper: "That’s right, Rose. But me not bein’ able to find him, it means he must have made it to Pitwell safe. He’s probably hauled up in some bar working out how best to say sorry to you. Ain’t no need to worry."

Rose: "And if he comes back you promise you won’t hurt him?"

Chopper: "I don't wanna hurt no one unless I have to."

She heaved one last pine branch over the minivan.

Rose: "Will that do?"

Chopper: "Yeah, minivan looks like one giant bush. Good work, Rose."

Rose: "So what now?"

Chopper: "Start moving down the track, Rose. We’re gonna have ourselves a nice sit down whilst we wait for Michael to walk back, catch him unawares so he doesn't cause no trouble."

And so they walked down the track and then into the trees lining it. I followed.

Half an hour later they were sitting on a pair of tree stumps near the track, waiting in ambush for Michael. Ancient, looming forest towered over us.

Chopper still had his firearm of course. 

Rose: "You're very comfortable with that gun."

Chopper: "Afraid that's what a life of unsavoury work and regret gets you."

Rose: "You said you were going steady with a girl once, you can't regret that?"

Chopper: "That was a long time ago. Reckon its best we just sit quietly and wait for Michael."

Rose: "Tell me about her, Chopper. After I told you everything about Michael, after you turned it all against me. The least you can do is talk to me."

Chopper: "You really don't need to know about her, Rose."

Rose: "But I want to know. And sitting in the dark waiting for Michael, it’s not like we have anything better to do than talk."

Chopper: "Hard to disagree with that …"

Rose: "Exactly. So tell me, what was her name?"

Chopper: "Her name was – still is – Lori."

Rose: "You said you blamed her for things that weren’t her fault. What things were you talking about?"

Chopper let out a long sigh. 

Chopper: "When I met Lori I had to stop doing the sort of illicit work I’d done all my life. To keep ahead of the law I’d always taken up in a new state every few months. That life weren’t suited to anything more than a flashfire romance."

Rose: "So you straightened out when you met Lori?"

Chopper: "Tried to. But I didn't exactly have the most respectable resume, ain't many places looking to hire a guy like me. All I could get was odd jobs, money got tight. I started taking it out on her. I said some bad things. Shouldn’t o’ been surprised when she up and left."

Rose: "Did you try and get her back?"

Chopper: "No, I let her go."

Rose: "And then you fell back into your old life and work? This sort of work?"

Chopper: "Yeah."

Rose: "Tell me more about Lori."

Chopper: "What do you mean?"

Rose: "Well, how did you meet?"

Chopper: "I was celebrating after a job. Some bar near the safe house. Not exactly the smartest move, but I ain’t exactly the smartest guy. Anyway, the bar had one of those karaoke machines and I was drunk enough to give singing a shot. Ended up choosing Sonny and Cher but I needed a partner. I put it to the bar and, lo and behold, Lori appeared from the crowd. I can’t sing worth a damn but she had the voice of an angel. By the end of the song I was smitten."

Rose: "So you stuck around just to be with her?"

Chopper: "Yeah. Once the heat was off the other boys moved on to their next jobs, but not me. I had reason to stay."

Rose: "You started dating?"

Chopper: "Yes, ma’am. I don’t know what Lori saw in me but she agreed to let me take her out. I still had money from the job, so I wined and dined her and took her on day trips to the beach. Our first kiss was at the local zoo, right in front of the sea lions. I swear the damn things cheered us on. Happiest day of my life."

Rose: "Do you know where Lori is now?"

Chopper: "Last I heard she’d set up on the east coast. Works in a laundromat, or so I hear."

Rose: "Have you ever thought of going to see her, telling her you’re sorry?"

Chopper: "Sometimes. A lot as a matter of fact. But if I ever do show up on her doorstep I don’t wanna be the same broke lowlife I was before. I wanna have money in the bank, I want Lori to know that I can look after her, treat her right. I guess that’s kinda why I’m doing this job."

Rose: "If you need money to impress Lori, why didn’t you just take mine?"

Chopper gave Rose a grave look.

Chopper: "This ain’t about your holiday tokens, Rose. There are millions of dollars at stake tonight."

They say money is the root of all evil. Fitting then that such riches are what drew such a monster to the mountain.

I truly hope I'm not calling that monster back to this cabin. Final part soon.

It all started with a knock on the door, it was around 10 p.m, the kitchen was right beside the front door so I could see the front yard. I looked out only to see a man with a mask looking right at the door, then the lights went off. Whoever was at the front door had left and I could hear many windows being shuffled. I started fearing for my life, shivers went down my spine. I am right now enrolled in the Durham Regional Police Academy so in the future I could become a police officer. So, in my parent's room, I put my gun ( which was an RCMP Model 3432 ) into a safe where my parents stored money.

 My mother, who also looked as frightened as I, said we should make a run for it into the backyard and sprint towards my Uncle’s house which was 3 blocks away from us. But I looked towards the backyard glass sliding doors and I could see the silhouette of a man and realized it looked like he was holding a knife. My mother and I decided to hide in the basement as it had the most durable lock. We brought in kitchen knives and hid there in the vast darkness. My mother was crying so I reassured her that everything was going to be okay. An hour went by, just staying there but not hearing any noises. ‘My father should have been home by now I thought to myself. We carefully went out of the basement and we saw that there was nothing.  That’s when I realized that I had a gun upstairs instead and I felt a little guilty as I am learning to be a cop and cops are supposed to investigate these kinds of situations. I didn’t know the code for the safe so my mother opened it and I got out my gun.

 My mother was beside me with a kitchen knife as we went into every room to see if anyone had broken in. We didn’t find anything which gave us the conclusion that there were just kids who were ding-dong ditching. My mother was still paranoid as my sister’s washroom window cracked open. Both of my sisters were attending a school overnight field trip to a campsite as the school year was coming to an end. I am a decade older than the two. Due to my mother’s paranoia, I slept with her in the master bedroom and I even brought my gun. She asked where my father was and I said ‘he is probably just busy. I went to bed but awoke around 2 am to hear my mother shouting. She was in the closet looking at something and something from the closet snatched her. I picked up my gun and pointed toward the closet but something from behind me started strangling me. I twisted his arm and pointed the gun at him. That man pointed a knife towards my mother but immediately I shot his hand. My shooting skills have succeeded as I successfully hit his arm and he dropped his knife. My mother picked it up as I let go of the man and pointed the guns toward both men. I told my mother to check the signal and electricity cable and she rushed to check. In a minute, the lights turned on and notifications were popping up on my phone. I picked up my phone and dialed 911 and my mother called my father.

 I unmasked one of the men and it was this 40-year-old man with a lot of facial hair who looked frightened. I unmasked the other one and was shocked to see my father's ex-best friend Tony. I remember meeting him a lot and my father and he were close but this man got involved with drugs or something. My father saw his changes and decided that this will eventually turn out into a toxic friendship so left him. But, he was very aggressive and my father was beaten up by him and his friends. My father ran back home and called the police on his best friend and in court, testified against him and Tony was sentenced to 16 years in jail for illegal drug use. It had been 16 years but I didn’t know how he got our location and why he would rob us. The police came and arrested them. Their car had weapons. My father didn’t pick up when the police went to go see his office and he was not there, he left his work office 5 hours ago. My mother and I cried and they found my father’s body the next day at a dumpster as it was wrapped in a garbage bag. 

He had 17 stab wounds. Both my sisters had to come back and we all cried. Tony and his friend, who we found out name was Tyler, were both sentenced to death. We had a funeral for my father shortly after. I still can’t forget that incident. 3 weeks after that incident I rebuilt and styled the basement and put it for rent. I got a part-time job at Walmart and my mother and one of my sisters worked for my mother’s friend who had a dress shop. That’s how we kept the house as we didn’t want to sell our house. I became a police officer at the Durham Regional Police and I have been working for 10 years. I purchased a new house which was a 2-garage huge house for my sisters, mother, and me. I put my former house on rent and I am 28 now. I am going to get married this year. I was even told by my chief that I might be appointed as the chief of police at the Durham Regional Police. My life right now is going great but I wish my father could see this and I could give him a big hug in person.

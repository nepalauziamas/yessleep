You think you're so safe...

*tap-tap-tap*

You think because you're behind a screen, sitting on the john or scrolling in bed, I can't find you...

*tap-tap-tap*

You read these stories and tales from other users, always from the point of view of the victim or the tragic fate of some college student driving home through the woods.

My latest mark got away for now, but as I sit here in the attic waiting for my moment, I'm writing to explain just how close I am to each of you.

I read thier story just moments ago.  Always brings wide, toothy grin to my face when I see these.

Wilhelmina Drive. Please. You simply noticed the events of the evening starting there.

My silence and stealth went on for 20 miles prior to that. Holding to the roof of your lame blue sedan, I waited.

Long, jet-black talons silently grouping the roof of this dumpy car. I could have struck at any moment.

You humans piss me off to no end. The comraderie among you. The thought to protect each other and warn of beasts and monsters nearby. It's annoying beyond belief. If those other dumb drivers hadn't flashed high beams your way, you never would have made it past mile-marker 12 and I'd be inside the car taking whats mine.

First flash. Fucking bright. I pull myself lower to the roof and freeze. You pace slows a bit, watching the corners for *something* out of the ordinary.

Finding nothing you resume your journey.

I'd waited long enough. Gripping tightly to the vehicle with my left, I raise my right..... arm? Appendage? Whatever you would call it. The cold, 40ish degree wind biting at my darkend flesh as I anticipate the warm, thick red liquid which will soon quench my thirst. Dreaming of it dribbling down my talon. I've been here before, I've felt this rush.

Second Flash. FUUUUUCK! That is so fucking bright! I sneer at the driver and contemplate jumping to thier vehicle. Again you slow. I can hear your movements inside. You've read the stoies and seen the shows. You look at your phone. You check the back seat. Filthy human. Just look up through the moon roof.

Look up and cast off the element of suprise so I may attack without consequence!

I'm getting bored. It's time. Again I clutch to the vehicle and raise my right.... arm? Appendage? Whatever the fuck you want to call it. I'm ready to strike. I feel the explosive muscles tightening as I prepare to rip the roof from the car and devour you. The frantic state is the sweetest thing in the world. Fear truly does garnish the lifeblood of you meatbags.

Third Flash. MOTHER FUCKER! I'm over it. I'm not dealing with this shit anymore. I need you to look up so I can strike. Until seen I can not attack. I can't become whole and in control until the chase is on. LOOK UP YOU TINY MAGGOT!

Fuck this. I'll start it.

*tap-tap-tap*

I gently bounce a talon off the moonroof window.

The fucker hits the gas. Not a huge deal as I'm able to hold on with relative ease, but where will they go? Somewhere crowded and I'll have to abandon the chase? Maybe we'll go to a police station and I'll have to run from the fireams they carry. Who knows, but we'll see.

*tap-tap-tap*

What's this? THEY'VE TAKEN ME HOME! If I weren't so worried about the neighbors I'd laugh histerically at this move. This will be so much more satisfying!

As they scurry inside, I see the hot air vent toward the roof and slink my way into the attic without making a sound.

I can hear them preparing for sleep, thinking they are away. Thinking they are safe and I've gone. As I'm typing this I remind them I'm here...

*tap-tap-tap*

It's finally time. MY time. I'll come back and let you know just how delicoius this evening turned out to be once I'm done and cleaned up.

See you **SOON**....

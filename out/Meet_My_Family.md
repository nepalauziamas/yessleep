Family is one of the most important things a person can have. For me, they have given me everything I can dream of. They have fed me, kept me clothed, and given me a roof over my head to protect me from what they call the weather! I don’t remember anything but my first memories take place right where I am now! 

Every morning, mother makes sure to wake me up, gives me my breakfast of eggs and sausage and sometimes she’ll even let me have chocolate milk! Lunchtime is always the best too, she gives me a delicious meat  sandwich to make sure I grow up to be nice and strong! Dinner is always the same too but I don’t mind at all, her meatloaf is so yummy! 

Father is always quiet but he’s very big and strong. Whenever mother is in the kitchen, he makes sure that nobody to spoil the meal, and he does such a good job! Sometimes when I get a little loud, Father makes sure to tell me but he never hurts me, never ever. He says that one day, I will make him and mother very happy. He even lets me play with action figures, crossword puzzles, and lets me read some funny books too. 

My brothers and sisters are also so fun to hang out with, and mother brings home new ones every single week! I sometimes hear Mother and Father talk about where they find all of us. All I know is they save us from some place called a nursery, and it is a part of some place called a “hospital”. It’s like I have an endless amount of fun no matter what! While it is a lot of fun, it does get a little cramped in our special room down the stairs. I always try to get a peak into Mother and Father’s room whenever they open the door to our special room. While we do have to stay in our cage, my imagination runs wild with what they might have upstairs! Could there be unicorns? Could there be super cool robots? I won’t know until I am 15!

The coolest part is that when one of us turns 15, we get selected to finally live in Mother and Father’s room! They always select the chunkiest of us first, I don’t know why but I’m making sure to finish all my meals so I get to be first when I finally turn 15! I’m always so jealous because I can hear my brothers and sisters screaming and having fun upstairs, it must be huge up there because eventually I can’t hear it anymore! After that, my parents always come down with meatloaf to make sure we get nice and chunky too. I make sure I’m very nice to my chunkier brothers and sisters because we always get more food after they get to go with Mother and Father than we get when the thinner brothers and sisters do!

So yes! That’s my awesome family! We might be a little different, but all I know is that we have fun! I can’t wait until I turn 15 so my parents can give my siblings a big meal to celebrate my birthday!!

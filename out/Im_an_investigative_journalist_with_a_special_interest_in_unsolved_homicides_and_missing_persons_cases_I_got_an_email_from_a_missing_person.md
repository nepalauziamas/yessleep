I'm an investigative journalist with a special interest in unsolved homicides and missing persons cases. I work for a major radio network in the US on a true crime podcast, and I have a public-facing email address where I receive all kinds of stories and leads. This, however, was the first time I got an email from a victim.

(I've been posting about the case I'm currently working on, and you can read [PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xwuk13/comment/ir8ws5z/) and [PART 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y0njom/part_2_im_an_investigative_journalist_with_a/) of that, but this is a separate story.)

Two years ago, I covered a missing person case on my podcast, as I do almost every week. This case was that of a four year old girl, "Louise" who disappeared out of her bed in the middle of the night on April 4th, 2000. According to her parents, they were planning on going out to dinner and a movie for the night, and hired a babysitter to take care of Louise. The babysitter, who we'll call Caroline, was well known to the family and had babysat for them quite a bit. So Caroline comes over at 7:30, right after Louise is put to bed by her parents. It should be an easy night for Caroline, who said she sat with the baby monitor and did homework and then watched TV. She didn't hear a peep from Louise all night, and when her parents returned at 10:30, Caroline collected her payment and went home.

The next morning, Louise's parents realize around 8:00 that Louise has slept later than she usually does. Mom goes to check on her, and she's gone. Her bed is rumpled, the bedroom window is open, and her lovey, a giraffe blanket embroidered with her name, is gone. She immediately calls the police, and of course Caroline is their first suspect. But there's no evidence. No fingerprints, no hair, nothing except the open window and the missing stuffed giraffe, Louise could not have opened the window by herself unless it was unlocked, which would be incongruous with every other window in the house and her parents' statements that they kept all the windows locked at all times. Even if she did get the window open, it's a sheer two story drop to the driveway below. There was no way she could have gone out the window and survived. Caroline is interviewed by the police over and over again, the house is searched, an AMBER alert is put out, but they can't put together a case. The case became known locally as the Peter Pan case because it appeared that Louise had just flown out the open window and disappeared.

A few months after I released the episode, along with the social media post including photographs of the girl, the house, the stuffed giraffe, and so forth, I got an email from a twenty-two year old woman, "Alison." She wrote, "I think I'm the missing girl from the Peter Pan case."

Alison explained that she was adopted out of foster care when she was six. Until recently, she believed she was turned over to the police by her birth mother to save her from an abusive, drug-addicted father, and that her parents adopted her as an infant. However, she had recently discovered that this entire story was fabricated by her adoptive parents when she came across her adoption paperwork, and that she had actually been picked up by DCF when she was around four years old and found wandering around a town by herself in the middle of the night, nearly sixty miles away from the house that Louise disappeared from.

At first I thought, *this is a super weird life story but can't possibly be related.* And then I opened the attachment to the email. It was Alison, at age 22, holding a giraffe baby blanket embroidered with the name "Louise."

"I found this, and my original adoption papers, in a locked filing cabinet in the basement. My mom is sick, and I was looking for life insurance paperwork. Instead I found a life I didn't know I had." The filing cabinet also contained newspaper clippings from Louise's disappearance and the pajamas that Louise was wearing when she disappeared.

DNA eventually proved conclusively that Louise’s parents are Alison’s biological parents. Her adoptive parents admitted to covering up the truth about her life, but only because they thought it would be too traumatic to know the truth—or, rather, to know nothing, because still no one knows how a four year old girl disappeared out a second story window in the middle of the night only to reappear, unharmed and unchanged, sixty miles away.

I'm a professional storm chaser. I've been in the industry for about 20 years now and chased large storms like Moore and a few tornadoes from the tornado outbreak of November 9 to 11 and am experienced with chasing these storms.

I've gone on around 100 to 200 storm chases and have been able to pinpoint and predict weather patterns and have a pretty good rate of pinpointing them.

However, this next storm I'm going to talk about was something that blew me out of the water. I'm very precise with my chases, and I'd say I'm pretty good at it. I'm more experienced with tornadoes rather than hurricanes, though.

Years ago. I am not too sure of the exact date, but it was in 2015. This hurricane had gone completely off the radar from storm trackers and satellites for an unknown reason. When this hurricane struck landfall in the Virgin Islands, the residents had no warning. The government was alerted by a citizen that a nasty shade of gray was looming in the distance of the sky. 

The hurricane was horrible. Everyone involved in the case was forced to keep silent as the U.S. government did not want the news to get out about how they caused hundreds if not, thousands of deaths on our soil. There was no official name- but our co-workers referred to it as "Tropical A."

The hurricane struck land in the southern part of the Virgin Islands at St. Croix. We tried to get as much information as possible and quickly alert the citizens, but it was no use. The winds flipped over cars and trees as the people came with them. It was almost cruel, how the hurricane toyed with its victims begging for mercy, wondering which god they displeased as they got pushed into floods that reeked of fish and corpses.

The hurricane lasted around 3 hours. A rescue and a clean-up crew were deported immediately, and what they found shocked them deeply.

When they came back onto the island, everything was destroyed. That was a given. It was most likely an underestimated loss of life that could have been easily preventable if the satellites didn't bug out. Shame, really.

This is where stuff gets a little dicey. I'm going off, completely what the rescue team said. Some things may be off. They were digging through the debris and broken homes. The storm was a category 5, and completely decimated this area. But strangely, there was no sight of a dead body. Not even one corpse- which was strange. No sounds for stranded people, it was utter silence. No sound. Deathly still. This town was busy and bustling at all times of day. 

Now, there could be a few reasons for this.

1. The bodies all washed to a central place.
2. The survivors managed to escape (Which we highly doubt, as there was no warning and the boats were still on the island)
3. Everyone died.

Even for a category 5 hurricane, there is bound to be a few survivors. Yet, the team scavenged through-out the entire island, and found nothing. The government called off the team and swept this incident under the rug like nothing happened. The entire Virgin Islands was out of power because the main power source was in central St. Croix. The government just.. let everyone to die.

However, a clean-up crew member went missing on the job. He was a dedicated worker of around 2 decades, becoming a safety member since 1995. If you don't know, these people are trained professionals. It's very unusual that someone would just.. disappear. No one could find him. It's a small island, and there's no reason for him to have gone off by his own.

The rescue team went back for him- and what they found on the way in was disturbing.

Immediately when they entered the bay, they smelled the horrible stench of rotting corpses. They pushed through it and followed the smell- which brought them to a cave that was pitch black and had weird energy. Almost like a dungeon of sorts.

At the bottom of the cave, it was more dark than it is midnight on most days. They looked through the large place, looking at every corner.

That's when they found him.

The rescue worker, who has been working with these same co workers for twenty years now. They've been through it all. Blood, sweat, tears. They found him hung by a noose with his eyes gouged out and   had his torso sliced, yet still together. His genitals were cut off. He had had horrible torture in his final minutes of life. His organs were in a bowl made with shells. This was done on purpose. It was a traumatizing scene. However, behind him was worse.

It was like the Paris Catacombs, but with humans who hadn't rotten away. Ones who had rats feasting off their flesh as the pile slowly turns into bones.

But why? Why were they all emptied here? Why were they all just.. laying here? The cave trek had took a half hour and was very steep at some points. There was a dull path. It was obvious that someone- or something else had been here. The people in the cave had no reception, and they quickly rushed out. I wish they had searched deeper for more answers?

Why?

When?

Is there an autopsy?

Who did this? What did this?

So many unanswered questions. So many answers to those unanswered questions. The rescue team had apparent PTSD and doesn't like to speak about this harrowing experience. The government had no good rescue teams as they had to use their troops for some other purpose. The case was basically swept under the rug, and I'm not sure if I have anymore leads.

All I know, is that, this was done on purpose. This was not natural. This may just be.. a mystery.

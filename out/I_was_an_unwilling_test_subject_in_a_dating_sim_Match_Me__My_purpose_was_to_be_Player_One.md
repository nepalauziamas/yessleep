You’ve all played games, right?

Imagine being in one—having your humanity torn away in place of an interface you have to obey.

“Match Me!”

Luckily, the game never came to be.

It was a prototype and never should have existed in the first place.

We were the reason behind its build. 

And its downfall. 

I began my new life drowning in echoes of old. I’m sure creating a character can be seen as fun from the player’s perspective. The creation of your ideal human being—and the ability to make them exactly how you want them. But there was just one problem.

 I wasn’t born as code, as a number in a computer, endless binary spanning into oblivion down a black screen. I was already real. I already existed, living eighteen years’ worth of memories—eighteen years of humanity. Feelings, emotions, likes and dislikes. I had loved and hated and wished and dreamed—and everything in between. So, first they had to take that away. They had to turn me from someone to no-one—a shell with its contents scooped out and ready to be filled back up. The initial process took place before I was torn from my physical body. 

I was lain down on a metal bed like meat to the slaughter while steel arms moved over my body, cutting and slicing me apart, removing my flaws and blemishes, everything I held dear to me and making way for perfection. The perfect eyes. The perfect lips, teeth and a carved, porcelain body.

I think it’s pretty normal for teenagers to question themselves. Who they are—- their identity. Who they want to be, and who they always have been. Who they love, what they believe in. 

What future they want to lead. That didn’t really apply to me. I didn’t have a past to look back on, or a future to look ahead to. The only thing I did have were splintered memories that I had to piece together like a jigsaw puzzle. Except imagine the pieces are disjointed and oddly shaped and don’t fit properly.

That was who I was—the lingering shatters of my mind. I know I had a life. I know I was someone who had a past and a future and dreams. I was someone. But that was taken away from me. I was Player One. I had become Player One. I had always in the present, past and future been Player One.

 I guess I’ll start from the beginning. I was born in splinters of my old life. I remembered deep blue beneath me and a whole other shade of sky looming above. It was a cloudless sky which continued on with the world around me—despite sinking beneath depths swallowing me into nothing.

There are parts of me I want to talk about but that will be much later. For now, I want to talk about the game and my existence inside it.

How I made up the foundations of its creation.

And how I escaped.

There are small things I remember about my other life. It’s like prying for something that’s a million miles away, a whole galaxy away. One, I managed to hold onto. It’s one of my most precious memories, one I will hold dear to me. There was a large, spacious room with air-conditioning. The room didn’t make sense to me as a memory because there were certain things missing, like what made it what it was.

I saw pieces of it, not enough to build a real picture; glimpses of chair corners and a pattern ceiling. I wasn’t alone, others around me.  A whole swarm of them, yelling and laughing, excited chatter. The atmosphere felt both right and not. I felt the sense of excitement and elation, though I wasn’t feeling it myself. Instead, I felt empty. I was warm. Not uncomfortably warm, but I was getting there. I remember wrapping my arms around a faceless shadow with a distinct smell. Lavender. 

The woman was nothing to me, a silhouette in an expanse of white—and yet I felt like she might have been important to me. She existed as a shadow with a phantom voice with no real tone, nothing recognisable, but she felt real to me. Like there had been something between us. My head was buried in her chest and I was breathing in lavender. My cheeks were wet, my chest was heavy and my stomach was catapulting into my throat.

“I don’t want to go.”

“It’ll be fun!” The woman’s laugh sounded and felt familiar. “You’ll make so many new friends!”

“I already have friends.”

“It’s just a week. You’ve always wanted to go to Japan!”

“Yeah. With you and dad. Literally anyone but these guys.”

“Then why did you give me the permission slip?”

“I didn’t! You found it in my bag!”

The voice wasn’t mine. It didn’t sound like mine because I didn’t know what I sounded like. If it was in my memory, though, and if I remembered the lump in my throat and ghostly words on my tongue, tangled and wrong, it must have been. Pulling away from the faceless woman who smelled like lavender, I lifted a hand and waved to her retreating figure which danced across blinding white and dived into a crowd of twitching shadows.

I was alone for a while, standing and frowning at nothing in particular. The crowd around me seemed to grow with excitement while my stomach twisted and turned and tried to projectile from my mouth. I moved away from the voices to where it was silent—to where I could inhale and exhale and not be stabbed in the chest repeatedly.

It got easier to breathe, then. My footsteps kept going until I could feel the graze of wind on my face. It’s well known that your senses help form a memory. In this case all I had were my senses. The smell of coffee, and then the taste in my mouth, the sting when I pressed my hands around the styrofoam cup. The stink of perfume from a passer-by, and the harsh wooden seat when I collapsed into a chair. The voices around me were far more subdued, the twist in my gut unravelling before another silhouette brushed by and sat next to me. 

Like the woman they were no-one too, a bleeding memory with no real identity. I did catch small things though. I saw raybans holding back thick dark hair, a short sleeved white shirt decorated with bugs and a beaded bracelet. “Anyone sitting here?”

A voice with no gender, but like the woman it spiked something inside me.

“Uh—“

“Good! Because I just pulled my luggage from my handler’s car to here, and I am exhausted.”

“Handler?”

“Uh, yeah. Sorry. I don’t do well in social situations and I tend to babble. See, I’m doing it now. If you want the long story my dad is a pretty big deal and my mom puts bad guys away, so I had a  pampered childhood—"

“I get it,” I cut the voice off. “You’re rich.”

“And there’s the short version.”

“Yeah.” I said. “Nice shirt.”

“Really? You don’t think the bugs are too much?”

“No, it’s—”

“Eccentric?”

“I was going to say different, but sure.”

A long silence passed. Though it was comfortable. It was a lot easier to breathe with them next to me.

“So. You’re a Pokémon fan, huh.”

“When I was ten years old.”

“You have a Squirtle keyring! Are you kidding me?”

“Huh? Oh, yeah. My mom bought this. It came with it.”

They scoffed, but I sensed the tease. “Fake Pokémon fan. You don’t even deserve the keyring.”

“Why don’t you have it then?”

“I mean, if you insist.”

My stomach relaxed, and finally, that excitement, that elation which had been buzzing around, filled me.

But it didn’t last.

Like a tape being fast forwarded I was no longer in the room full of blinding light. I was falling, enveloped in mechanical cries and a loud screeching noise. There was no place to run, to escape to. Escape was suicide and the only thing left to do was fall—and scream. Outside, there was only white. White which became blue and was white again. The world rattled around me and my skull was filled with the screams of surrounding shadows, and my own.

I was plunging deep, deep, down, gasping into something plastic pressed over my face.  In the time it took for me cry out to loved ones and regret taking advantage of everything I ever had, everything… stopped. Freezing cold fingers tip-toeing over my face—rough hands pulling me from smoke and wreckage. My body was a heavy weight, and I was choking on the taste of rusty coins. Someone had hold of me, arms around my chest, pulling me through something warm which moved with me, lapping around my body. It felt… good. 

It felt like I was being reborn. 

Cracking open an eye I struggled fully take in reality, blinded by a suffocating force burning into my face. I was lying on something soft, something cradling my aching bones—and when I had the strength to keep my eyes open for longer than half a second I was staring into a pool of endless blue.

Blue, which stretched out in front of me, overlapping and bleeding into each other; two plains which met.

The peaceful didn’t last.

 Before long I was lying on cold metal, and claw-like mechanical arms were grazing over my skin. I knew what would happened next—what it entailed. I’d already seen it happen in the bed next to me. They were still cleaning the blood from the floor. 

Or trying to clean it. The colour was bright red, an intense scarlet smearing clinical floor tiles. Intense red meeting red can be beautiful--- if you let it. If you let your imagination reach that far. I suppose the same thing happened what you read about in Wiki articles. When the brain experiences trauma it tries to protect the brain, tries to hide you away from the hurt and the pain and the horror unfolding in front of your eyes. It creates a new world in your head.

 One that was less painful, less despairing. What I saw were spider-like twitching arms taking a girl’s skull into a vice grip before ripping off top of her head like it was that easy—like it was pulling off the lid from a bottle. The top of her head was flung into a wheel of spinning blades and was gone within an instant, and the rest of her, the internal parts of her, was scooped out of her skull. I’d never seen a human brain up close before, and right then I wasn’t sure if I was. In my head, I was someplace else. I was far, far away with the shadow woman in our shadow house. 

I was safe.

Our brains can only protect us to a certain point.

Before it gives up.

It cant.. it can’t cover it up anymore. It can’t make things better.

Because they weren’t. I couldn’t bask in an imaginary delusion my own mind was trying to force me inside.

All I knew was the force that had taken me—taken us—it wasn’t human.

And… that was it.

That was all which was left of who that person was—who had screamed and cried and begged not to have the same fate. I didn’t, in the end. I was left alone. While others were torn open and turned inside out, I was left.

And then I was nothing.

So easy, right? It’s easy to write it, sure. But imagine this happening to you. You are someone, a someone who is loved by others. Who means something to the world. And then you’re not. It’s so easy to bring a life into the world, and just as easy to pull it back out.  I didn’t begin my new life as Player One dwelling on the old, however. I didn’t have anything to dwell on. Everything which had been me had been torn away, so what was there really to hold onto? I awoke inside—- pink. 

Everything was bright pink. Pink and blue, flowers and cherry blossom dancing around me. I felt it in my hair and fluttering on my face. It was annoying, but I couldn’t do anything about it. My arms weren’t working. Neither were my legs. None of me worked. When I tried to shield my face from falling cherry blossom, my body stayed frozen in place—and I became aware of several things. I was smiling. 

No, grinning. My smile was wide and unnatural, stretching across my face. While I stayed frozen, the stretch of bright pink bled into light blue. Something appeared in the middle of the screen, a tiny heart shaped curser.

Then, words came up in block white capitals.

SHOOTING STAR GAMES PRESENT.

DEVELOPED BY GENESIS WATCH.

A melody started soft and low, getting progressively louder before “Match Me!” bounced onto the screen, animated letters sitting behind a silhouette of a heart. When an on-screen keyboard flashed up I thought I was dreaming. It’s not like I had only just woken up. I knew what had happened to me and it felt wrong to feel like I was dreaming, because I didn’t have thoughts which had dreams. I didn’t have a brain to have my own thoughts. 

You know when you take a long nap and wake up and forget the day, the year, even your name? It was like that. Except it didn’t come back like it was supposed to. I was a blank slate. There was nothing to remember. There was nothing, and then there was something, and I was standing in front of dancing cherry blossom grazing my cheeks. Who was I? The words crossing my mind were a surprise.

I was—I was thinking. I didn’t think I was supposed to be thinking. That was the whole part of ripping away my humanity. I did have one thought, and it wasn’t about the pieces of me I wanted to find, or anything really. I could argue and say these words were mine, a sort of cold irony, or even genuine. They could have been implanted inside me or had come from my old self.

Questions.

Questions meant I was still holding on.

Questions meant I was still me—to an extent.

Who was I?

Where was I?

Most importantly… what was I?

The words came up suddenly, too fast to catch.

INPUT YOUR NAME.

I did, reaching out. I didn’t move, but the keys flashed for me.

P. L. A. Y. E. R  -- O. N.E

When enter was pressed, the screen didn’t waver, and more words appeared:

PLEASE MAKE SURE TO USE CAPITAL LETTERS, A NUMBER AND A SPECIAL CHARACTER.

 P. L. A. Y. E. R  -- O. N.E. 1*

When I it enter once again, the keyboard disappeared and I was met with an image of a park which grew progressively bigger until it was expanding around me and I was bleeding into its reality around me. I was taken aback by how real it felt. 

Everything from the people around me appearing in flashes of light, cool wind grazing my face and the air prickling my bare arms. I could move, but it wasn’t by my command. I ducked and then stood up and then ducked again, this time my hands coming out to graze my fingers over rough concrete which tickled the palms of my hands. I tipped my head back and stared at the sky, at the sun sitting like an unspoiled egg yolk. 

 Starting forwards I began to walk, and around me the world moved like it was reality, like I was standing in any normal park. Like every other park but made to be perfect, purged of anything which wasn’t natural or pretty.

Every tree was in perfect bloom, cherry blossom dancing in the breeze, and every passer-by had the same perfectly symmetrical face. They were all the same age. People in their late teens. Students. They wore colourful clothing, and I heard their laughter and chatter, but when I really looked at them, their expressions were frozen in a smile. It’s weird. The whole world seemed to be just the park. 

I saw nothing beyond cobblestone pathways and a large water fountain and river surrounded by perfectly lain flower beds. I kept walking, unsure of where my legs were taking me. Passers by failed to look at me, their eyes pinpointed on nothing in particular.

A pop up appeared in the middle of the screen, and I stopped walking. Reality seemed to come to an abrupt stop, just like me. People froze in place, a dog which was jumping into the air to catch a squirrel was caught in a snapshot. Even the air tickling my arms and the blaze of the sun halted, leaving me feeling like I was stuck in a void, like I would never breathe again. 

It was like torture. Not being able to move, to cry out and ask to be let go by a force keeping me frozen in place. What if whoever was playing me went away? I thought. What if they had gotten bored or gone to get pizza, or switched me off? A second passed before words appeared in that same fancy font, all the I’s dotted with hearts. Like being hit in the face.

When the pop-up vanished, I could breathe again. I wasn’t sure if I had feeling, if I had the ability to panic and freak out. But my brain was used to it, used to sending my thoughts flailing. With no body to control, and no real thoughts of its own, however, my brain continued, unsure what to do. I felt that I should have been panicking, that I was lucky to breathe and thankful for the breeze on my face and the sun shining in my eyes once again. Except I wasn’t me. I was Player One. 

So, following the players lead I strode forwards until I glimpsed a girl standing by the river. From the look of her, far too bright among the shadows of others, I had a feeling she was my first goal. I was right. Moving closer to her, I saw a close up. 

She was around seventeen or eighteen, short with dark brown curls, a summer dress which hugged perfect curves. Perfect, I thought. Looking closer, everything about her was perfect. When she turned away from the lake, I caught a glimpse of long, sculpted legs. Her hair seemed to bounce on her shoulders, not a strand out of place. When my steps quickened, my player driving me closer towards the girl, I saw her eyes; a shade of coffee brown while her smile was wistful. Like she was a daydreamer.

An interface flashed up when I was several feet from her. It surrounded her, a pink glow highlighting her features. The girl picked something up off the ground, a squeaky toy, and threw it in the air for a large golden Labrador I had only just noticed. The dog had been chasing cherry blossom and squirrels before she had whistled it over.

{NONA CHURCH]

Age: 17 years old.

Likes: Pizza, movies, books, animals, walks in the park, coffee.

Dislikes: Lazy people, creepy crawlies, water.

When the blossoming pink glow faded, a small pop-up appeared at the bottom of the screen.

[WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?]

>Greet Nona.

>Insult Nona.

>Push Nona in the river. 

The third option flashed, and I jerked, my body lunging forward. I couldn’t stop myself, my movement, my body and legs in my player’s hands. Before I could force some control over myself or even begin to try and think for myself, I was striding towards the girl. Nona turned from stroking her dog and straightened up to meet eyes with me. There was a small smile on her lips, curiosity sparking in her eyes—before my hands were thrusting out and violently shoving her. Nona’s expression didn’t waver.
 
She was still smiling as her arms shot out, windmilling, before she toppled into the water. There was a splash animation before her head appeared, and she swam to the side and climbed out. 

The moment Nona was back in front of me I expected her to be magically dry, but her hair was still sticking to her face, her dress glued to her skin. She didn’t move for a moment, and in that time I wondered if she was another soulless shadow like passers-by or was like me. Nona’s knuckles smashing into the side of my jaw snapped me out of it and I stumbled back.

It didn’t hurt. I mean, the game itself told me it hurt, and my hand shot up to rub at my jaw, my grinning mouth twisting into a grimace. But there was no pain.

Another set of options flashed up, swimming in pink:

> Laugh at Nona

> ”Sorry, I saw a fly.”

> ”Are you okay?”

> Push Nona in the river.

Option two was highlighted, thank god.

“Sorry.” I said. My voice wasn’t much of anything, just a generic tone, “I saw a fly.”

“You saw a fly?” She shrieked. “You saw a fly and decided to push me into a river?”

“I said I was sorry.”

Nona folded her arms, though she didn’t look mad. Her smile had returned, and I noticed the sun was rapidly drying her hair and clothes. Her eyes drank me in, raking down my body and scrutinising my face, and I could tell from her expression she liked what she was looking at. “You better be,” She gestured to her dress. “This is new!”

More options appeared:

>Ask Nona on a date.

>Ask Nona if she wants to get a drink.

>Push Nona in the river.

> DRÖ̵̫͈́W̸̭̏͑N ̴͇̿NO̴̘͊̃N̷̨̟͑A̴̗̓

The bottom option was new—and it carried a certain something with it, a something which was strong enough, a sense of dread like no other, like ice running through my none-existent veins and igniting a body which I no longer had. With it granted me free thought for just a moment, a speck of my own free will bleeding though. I was able to move for a second. Just my eyes, nothing else.

But it was enough to glimpse certain things had suddenly gone awry. Nona’s dog’s neck twisted so sickeningly, and it turned to me. It didn’t have any real expression the way a dog should. Instead, it just stared at me before turning back with a stomach churning snapping noise.

The sky above darkened just slightly. Not enough for people to notice, but enough for me. Because until then, the sun had been shining and there had been no clouds. Now there was just one singular cloud. It wasn’t grey or had signs of an oncoming storm, but something about that one cloud was unsettling.

What… the fuck?

The thought didn’t last—too weak to take hold.

But it was my voice. It was the voice from those splinters of memories.

The options wavered, and I caught each word unravelling itself and being rewritten. With the options, the same thing was happening to my surroundings. The cloud disappeared and the sky brightened, Nona’s dog seemingly back to normal. While I was waiting, Nona grabbed another stick and threw it in the air for her dog to catch.

“Beans! Here boy!”

>Ask Nona on a date.

>Ask Nona if she wants to get a drink.

>Push Nona in the river.

>Ask Nona about the secrets of The University of Styx.

I didn’t even see the option get selected. The words were pouring out of my mouth before I could stop them.

“Do you want to get a drink?” I smiled. “It’s the least I can do, after getting you all wet.”

Nona shrugged. “Fine. You owe it to me. I’m Nona.” She inclined her head. “What’s yours?”

“{Player One}.” I replied.

“Player One, huh?” Her lips curved into a smile. “Nice name.”

She held out her hand for me to take, and options came up again.

>Shake Nona’s hand

>Tell bad joke.

> YOU N̷̫̰͘EẼ̵͙̻D T̶̤̈́O Ẉ̶̉͒A̷̲̾̚KE̵̥͆ HER UP̸̢̬͌


The final option’s text twisted and squirmed like it was alive, like it was fighting an unseen attacker.

Before I could fully take it in, Nona blinked. “So, Player One! Do you go to [THE UNIVERSITY OF STYX]?

>[THE UNIVERSITY OF STYX]? What’s that?

>Yes! Of course I go there.

>You named your dog Beans?

I waited for another cryptic final option, but it didn’t appear. The screen flickered, though, and I could tell whatever was trying to push through was failing. The second option flashed and a smile split my lips wide open.

“Yes, of course I go there.”

Nona nodded with a grin. She bounced on her toes, and a pink blush spread across her cheeks. Words flashed above her head: “NONA LIKES YOU!” Followed by an animation of coins dropping from the sky. [YOU HAVE EARNED 5 COINS. USE THE COINS AT STORES SUCH AS THE CAMPUS COFFEE SHOP, LIBRARY AND STORE. YOU CAN ALSO GIVE THEM TO MATCHES, SPEND THEM AND GIFTS AND USE THEM AS BRIBES WITH FRIENDS!}

 “Great!” Nona shoved me playfully. “Well, there’s a store on campus. I’d like their most expensive latte, please.”

The world stilled again, and once more I could no longer breathe. I could sense the world changing around me, trees bleeding away and the ground crumbling under my feet. An upbeat pop song started up, and red hearts flew across my eyes, butterflies dancing Nona and I. The girl froze like me, her smile stayed the same, eyes unblinking. When I waved my hand in front of her face, it hit me. I could move.

 It wasn’t just my eyes, I could really move. In the space between the load screen and the game play, my body was mine again. Opening my mouth, it wasn’t even mine. But the words were mine, coming out in a garbled hiss which finally felt right to me.

“What the fuck?” I hissed out. When Nona didn’t move, I stumbled back, regaining control of my feet. I ran towards a cherry blossom which had been left behind, but before I reach it, it burst into a blur of colours. I started to panic, swallowing a cry.  There was nowhere to run—and the feeling which came over me was so familiar. The dread in my gut, the ache in my chest. When I was falling—when I was falling with the mechanical screams.

 My panic felt real enough, though, and it anchored me. Before I could manage anything but a step forwards, my surroundings were blurring in and out of focus, before a new image started to come into view, folding out in front of me like a pop-up book. 

A coffee shop. A knock off Starbucks. StarBroffs was proudly minted on every surface with that familiar green siren. Tables and chairs appeared, followed by a counter, and finally customers bleeding to life. Students in groups, laughing and drinking and in front of laptops— and three tired looking barista’s. I was sitting in front of a smiling Nona. In front of the two of us was a black coffee and a latte.

“I should ask Nona about my sister.”

The words popped up on the screen, as well my voice which came out in a toneless internal monologue.

Across the table, Nona was stirring her latte, her eyes on me. “You’re in deep thought, Player One.”

“Yeah, my sister.” I said internally. “This is why I came here, after all. I have to find out what happened to Poppy.”

The lights in the coffee shop dimmed, each singular bulb illuminating our table.

More options appeared at the bottom of the screen, this time bathed in a teal blue colour.

> Ask Nona if she’s noticed anything strange going on at The University of Styx

> Sip Coffee and choose not to chat with Nona.

> ”You named your dog Beans?”

My player went with the first.

I took a tentative sip from my drink. It tasted like nothing even when I felt coffee filling my mouth and running down my throat. “So, Nona,” settled her with a smile which was friendly but bordering on curious.

“Have you noticed anything strange about The University of Styx?”

[MY SISTER] flashed up onto the screen.

I got a glimpse of a girl, maybe a year older than me. She shared my facial structure, my dark brown hair and perfect eyes. [MY SISTER ATTENDED THIS SCHOOL A YEAR AGO. SHE STOPPED SENDING LETTERS A MONTH AGO. WHEN I CALLED TO ASK WHERE SHE WAS, THE COLLEGE HAVE NO IDEA. SHE HASN’T BEEN SEEN IN MONTHS].

Nona noticeably stiffened, her eyes darkening. Not her character, though. Nona’s character was bright and smiley, but something far more real  was brewing behind her eyes, an emotion I couldn’t read.  She leaned a hand on her fist. “A lot of weird things have happened at Styx,” she said. “What do you want to know about?”

I didn’t answer. I wasn’t sure why—I just sat and stared at her.

Nona cocked her head. “Player One?”

More images were flashing in front of my eyes. I saw a diary opening to the latest page. When I tried to read what it said, the same thing was happening. Another force was taking control and trying to rewrite the words.

ROSEBUD

ROSEBUD

ROSEBUD

ROSEBUD

“Huh.” My internal monologue said. “Maybe I should ask Nona about [ROSEBUD].”

“Nona, what can you tell me about Rosebud?”

I thought, for a second, she wasn’t going to reply—or even react.

Though Nona seemed to be having a delayed reaction. Her index was still swiping the rim of the cup when her eyes flickered. Behind me, a barista dropped a tray—and next to her, a guy stood up suddenly from his table. The same thing was happening. That rift in the so-called reality I had found myself in.

Perfection was faltering, the foundations of the world beginning to break. Outside, a car crashed into a wall. There were no screams, no reaction from anyone. It was happening subtly too. Beans, who was tied up outside, did another 360 head turn.

Looking directly at me.

“What?”

Nona’s voice startled me. She sounded like she was waking up from a long dream. Just like the world around me, I was partially aware and able to control myself. But something was new. 

There was a noise. It sounded like static, like a radio being tuned, and it was loud, screeching into my head. With it were what sounded like whispers. At first they sounded like white noise, but the more I looked around and drank in other people who had stopped what they were doing—their eyes finding oblivion—I realised I was hearing whispers.

 Not intelligible, but loud enough for them to make an impact. Turning back to the girl, Nona had jumped up from her chair, her eyes wide, lips twisted. “No, I can’t do this,” Nona shook her head with a shaky hiss. I noticed her hands were trembling when they grabbed her bag. “I can’t do this again.” Her voice grew more hysterical and I found myself battling the interface for my own thoughts. It still wanted to continue the story, whatever narrative was going on. 

“No.” Nona whispered, clawing at her hair. “No, no, no, I shouldn’t… I shouldn’t be here. I should be…”Her eyes travelled to me, and there was sudden profound sadness in them. And it was all hers, I realised.

The sadness, pain and despair in her eyes—it wasn’t the interface or the game.

 It was hers.

“I need to—I need to go.” Nona whispered.

To my confusion, the game played along—another prompt coming onto the screen. This time it didn’t look like it belonged, like it had been put there by accident. It barely fit the screen, half of the first option cut off.

> Ask if you can end the date earl--

>Ask Nona about {R̵o̷s̸e̷b̷u̵d̷}

> A̵s̴k̶ ̷N̵o̴n̸a̸ ̵w̵h̵e̸r̵e̸ ̸t̸h̵e̶ ̷f̴u̶c̴k̸ ̴y̵o̷u̶ ̶a̵r̷e̸ ̴

Before Nona could run, I reached out, and I was the one in control. I grabbed her by the wrist. I noticed customers start to blink out of existence. Followed by chairs and tables, the wall closing in on the two of us, like the pop-up book was closing. I kept a steel grip on her wrist. Before I could open my mouth and use my words, I was standing in bleeding white once again, and Nona was in front of me.

A prompt slid onto the screen. This time it looked unnatural and wrong like it had just been typed out.

W̶a̷k̷e̵ ̷u̸p̸,̵ ̷D̶y̸l̸a̷n̷.̵ ̷I̴ ̵n̴e̶e̶d̵ ̴y̷o̴u̴ ̷t̵o̵ ̷w̶a̵k̴e̶ ̷u̶p̷ ̶f̷o̸r̶ ̸m̷e̵,̸ ̴o̷k̴a̷y̵?̷ ̴C̶o̸m̷e̸ ̶o̶n̵,̵ ̷I̷ ̴k̷n̵o̵w̷ ̶y̷o̶u̸'̶r̴e̸ ̶i̵n̴ ̶t̸h̸e̶r̷e̷.̸ ̶T̵h̴e̶y̵'̴r̴e̶ ̵c̷o̴m̶i̵n̵g̶.̶ ̶G̶o̶d̷ ̸d̷a̶m̸n̸ ̸i̷t̴ ̶I̷ ̴c̶a̸n̵'̶t̸ ̵s̵t̶a̶y̶ ̷h̴e̷r̴e̶ ̷a̵l̸l̵ ̶d̶a̸y̵!̷ ̶Y̵o̴u̷ ̶n̸e̶e̷d̷ ̶t̶o̴ ̸w̶a̵k̸e̴ ̵u̴p̴!̷

“Player One?”

Nona startled me, her voice soft. “I don’t want to talk anymore. I’ll s—see you later, okay?”

But she didn’t move. Her expression was the same. I could hear her voice bit her lips weren’t moving. I heard her footsteps fading away. But she was still standing right in front of me. “I’ll see you later, okay?”

Her eyes lit up and then went dark before lighting up again.

“I’ll see y— you later, okay?”

“I’ll see you l— later, okay?“

“I’ll see you l—l—l—l—“

“Maybe I’ll ask her about Poppy.” My internal dialogue was too loud in my skull, forcing its way into my mouth. The game was trying to continue.

Trying to fight whatever had slipped inside.

“Maybe I’ll ask h—her about Poppy.”

“Maybe I’ll ask her- her- her- her- her- her - her her-“

The words fluctuated on the screen.

“Rosebud.” Nona said in a sharp breath. And it was her voice—her real voice.

“That’s how we get out,” She whispered, her eyes meeting mine. “But it’s suicide.”

I opened my mouth to speak and found I could. “What?”

The girl grabbed my hand and pulled it to her heart.

“It… it hurts.” Her voice choked up. “If you wake them up with Rosebud, they’ll start screaming and they’ll never stop. I’ve lived in peace, without their whispers and their pain, because I can’t deal with it.” She gripped my hand tighter and smiled brightly, brightly enough to fake it.  

“Please. Let’s just… stay for a while, okay? Can we just stay a while? It was so peaceful. I felt like I was dreaming. I didn’t have to scream. I didn’t have to be scared. I could just close my eyes and dream, and everything would be okay. Rosebud isn’t finding peace. It’s hell.”

Above Nona, the prompt flickered, the words twisting.

The smell of copper suddenly filled my nose.

No, not copper.

Rusty coins.

Hot and fresh in my mouth and my nose. I could feel it warm, dripping down my face, and a voice sounded out:

It seemed to be coming from everywhere and yet nowhere. It didn’t make sense in the world.

But I found myself believing it was real.

“No, no, no, no! Get off me! You can’t do this! Let me go! Let me fucking go, you scrap piece of shit!”

Gunshots sounded.

Nona pressed her hands over her ears and squeezed her eyes shut.

“Make it stop!” She squeaked. “I don’t want to see it again. Make it stop! Make it stop!”

An option popped up:

>Stay with Nona

>Ask about your Divinia

>Ask about your Divinia

>Ask about your Divinia.  

>Ask AbOuT yOuR fUcKiNg DaVInIa

The world went black, then. Hopelessly black. Despairingly black, and the smell of rusty coins faded.

After a while of nothing, I was greeted to the main menu once again. This time, though, the colours were washed out and less bright. A butterfly hit the M in “Match!” before slamming into the ground and disappearing.

INPUT YOUR NAME

When nothing happened, no player stabbing in my name, I stepped forward and entered one instead.

D. Y. L. A. N.

Before I was taken back to the park, to the start of the game, a pop-up flashed up.

[YOU HAVE UNLOCKED A NEW CHARACTER!]

The image of a guy appeared with a cheesy grin giving the camera a thumbs up.

Kai Nevermind.

... 

The garbled text was replaced by a shower of cherry blossom and that same pop-song.

YOU ARE {DYLAN} LOOKING FOR A MATCH! WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO FIRST?

When I stepped into the park for the second time, the game seemed like it was back to normal. But this time I had a name again. I had a semblance of myself, the smell of rusty coins still choking the back of my nose and throat. When I jumped forwards and stared down at my hands, when I tipped my head back and stared at the fake sun glaring down at me. I walked over to an NPC and punched him in the face, and nothing happened. The NPC continued walking, and I followed him. 

I could see the game was still trying to push me forward, to find a match. The interface wobbled and flickered as it illuminated potential guy’s and girls, names flashing up in garbled code. The game was shattering underneath its perfect façade. It needed me to progress the story.

NPC’s at the corner of my eye were closing in on me, tracking my every step.

But I ignored them.

I had one goal in my head.

I had to find Nona.

This is a tough experience for me to write. Though I feel like I have to write this if nobody else is going to talk about it, I’m going to open my big mouth. 

My lawyer said I should live a peaceful life with the compensation money, but fuck that. This shit has fucked me up for life.  I’m exposing those bastards for what they did to me.

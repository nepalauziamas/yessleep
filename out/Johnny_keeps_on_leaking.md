Johnny keeps on leaking. I told him not to rebel against them but he did it anyways. They came for him last week and tied him up outside. The screams stopped a few days ago but he’s been there for a while and he’s starting to leak. I told him it wasn’t worth it. I tried to ask if they’d let me bury him, but they didn’t understand my language or even the concept of burying the dead. I was put to work a few days ago and I spend long hours outside digging something. I don’t know where they came from or what they want but this is our life now. Johnny didn’t wanna accept that and now he’s tied up outside and his body leaks. I overheard someone talking and apparently there’s stuff that’s valuable in our depths. I don’t really care about valuables, I just want my life back. I used to spend almost every day outside fishing, and since they came I haven’t gone fishing once. And now the rivers are dried up and the fish leak just like Johnny. Even if I did get the chance to fish I don’t think I could. My body aches from all the work and when I try and rest they hurt me. They do that a lot to us and sometimes when people really misbehave they do unspeakable things. 

They have us all living in a tiny pen and I can barely even stretch my legs out to go to sleep. People cry and scream in the middle of the night, and it wakes me up. The other day a guy killed another dude over half a water bottle, I saw it with my own eyes. Everyone just sat there and watched his dead body lie there. We are all so used to it. I see strung up people outside all the time, with their insides leaking out just like Johnny’s. I try and stay out of the way and accept the rules and rations I get. It’s not much, I almost always go to bed hungry and sometimes the water is undrinkable and my mouth gets so dry I feel like I’m choking. If I don’t die from them killing me then the dehydration will get to me for sure. The one guy who sleeps next to me, Ricardo, will sometime sneak me some water. He’s a real nice guy and I like hearing the stories about his wife and kids. He tells me about his wedding on the beach and how his eleven year old son loved baseball. They’re gone now, but Ricardo keeps on insisting he will see them soon. I never really got the chance to settle down before they came. I’d just fallen in and out of love for a while but I always thought I’d have more time. I think I took a lot of things for granted and looking back now I’d do anything for a cheeseburger and some fries. My stomach is grumbling just thinking about it. 

I know I will die sooner or later but I wonder how at this point. I’ll try and do my work but I don’t know how much more I can take. I hope they don’t string me up outside for everyone to see. I don’t want my insides to leak like Johnny’s.

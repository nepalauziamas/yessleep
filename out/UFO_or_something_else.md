When I was around 13 years old, my brother, 18 years old, came back to live with us after he was put in a correctional facility ( I hope I'm remembering correctly). He was put somewhere by my parents, he stole some stuff and assaulted people for the fun of it.

I haven't seen him in years, so naturally, I wanted to spend some time with him. My parents bought us BB guns after I begged for them, we both got an air pistol with a lot of bullets. When we got home, I went into the house to put some things away, then I heard my brother call my name outside. When I got outside, I didn't see him, I just felt a BB hit my back, I knew, he planned to shoot me while I wasn't expecting it. So I planned the same thing, I knew he would have to take out the trash as my Mom asked him after finishing dinner, so I decided to everyone, I was going to bed, but I slipped out to wait for him outside.

I decided to hide behind my mom's car, it was parked close to the garbage bin outside. I was there for maybe 15 minutes, but in that 15 minutes, the weirdest thing happened. I was bored, so I just looked at the night sky, my eye caught something that looked like a star, but it was much brighter that the rest of the stars, it was also flickering with different color hues, not full on color, but like white with some colors mixed in. I felt strange while looking at for some reason, but not long after I felt uneasy, the star seemed to dim down, now being a bit dimmer than normal stars, but still visible... "I've never seen a star dim before" , thought to myself, after that thought ran through my head, it got brighter than before, just shoot across my head, away, into the night sky.

Now, I've never experienced something like that ever again, I felt strange while looking at it, but after it shot away, I was fine...I felt unsure, what are the odds, my brother comes back, we buy BB guns, he ambushes me just so I get the same idea, just for me to be outside, at the exact same moment as this bright, shining something, deciding to leave it's current location. 

It had no trail behind it, I've seen a few shooting stars, most of which had a white trail and one I saw looked like it had a rainbow of colors behind it, but this object, had nothing begind it, it got brighter and it flew into the dark nothingness. I'm not educated in stars or anything else in the solar system, so my knowledge on this topic is pretty limited. I was a kid, I told my brother, he told me that I was seeing sh*t and that I was in the dark, alone for too long. 

Any theories?

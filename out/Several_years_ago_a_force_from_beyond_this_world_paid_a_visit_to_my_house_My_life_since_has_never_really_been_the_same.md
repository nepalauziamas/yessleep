“Goodnight”, my Dad says to me as he opens up my bedroom door, light spilling lazily across the carpet. “I’ll see you tomorrow”.

“Yeah, night Dad”, I grumble, scrunching my covers up a little tighter around my chin.

“I’m sorry about the party, Nate. We’re just doing what we think is best… I promise”.

I mutter to myself, watching my father’s silhouette shift in the light from beyond, then I roll over in bed and make a point of turning away from him.

I hear my Dad sigh and step out into the hallway, and he quietly closes the door behind him as he leaves.

&#x200B;

The hallway’s light is lost to the room’s cool darkness.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

We had an argument today. My parents and I.

&#x200B;

I accused them both of being cruel, and needlessly unfair. I made it a pretty big deal, to be honest. Maybe I shouldn’t have.

It’s just- I’m thirteen. Most of my friends are at a party tonight in the next town over. An outdoors one, with tents and everything. My Mom said I was too young to go and my Dad agreed, so, naturally I’ve been in a foul mood all evening.

I chew my tongue and fume for a while in silence, tossing and turning as the gentle murmur of my parents in the living room gradually fades away. I hear them ascend the stairs. The sliver of light beneath my door grows dimmer, and then after a while goes out entirely. I hear my parents close the door to their own room. Bed time for them too, I guess.

I stare across my room at one of my posters, stuck up on the wall. It’s tough to see in the dark, but I know which one it is. It’s the one from the movie *Alien.* 

Good film.

…My Dad introduced me to it.

I sigh and shut my eyes up real tight, willing myself into a slow and uneasy sleep. The dreams do come eventually, and they revolve around my friends, all still awake, and having the time of their lives together. The dream version of myself cannot decide if I am actually there with them or not. My friends react only fleetingly to my presence, and the dream delivers a sense of cold disconnection and unsettling isolation. 

…Of loneliness. I want to understand more, but, I don’t know how. I don’t know how to fix it.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I am unsure exactly what it is that awakens me.

But whatever it is, I return to the real world with my heart beating fast, and my mind instantly alert.

&#x200B;

I clutch the sheets as I feel myself begin to sweat. My body has become aware of something that my conscious self has yet to pick up on.

A beam of light passes down the window, filtered and distorted through my curtains. If my window didn’t look out onto my back garden, I’d think it were a passing car.

*An airplane, maybe?*

It is followed by another, however, and then another. Horizontal bars of grim light in faded yellow.

&#x200B;

I stare at these lights, wide-eyed.

&#x200B;

The house creaks softly in the dark. A gentle rustle of wind is heard beyond the walls. I think I can just about hear the faintest hiss from the boiler, a few doors down.

And then, the noises *stop*.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

All of them, all at once.

&#x200B;

Every last hint of sound or movement of any kind is sucked from air; the experience, despite lasting only a few seconds, is disorienting to the extreme. Like all the life in the world was just drawn away, and this empty vacuum was left in its place. Never before have my ears been given such true, deathly, *haunting* silence.

My breath catches fast in my throat.

A final beam of light passes down behind the curtains, and with it returns the sound. A quick, sudden tremor is sent rumbling across my room. The bed shakes and I cling myself to the mattress as best I can, beset with terror. A pen is sent rolling and clattering off the edge of my desk. The alien poster peels away from the wall a little and droops in one corner.

*What the hell is happening?* I think to myself, trying to will together the urge to get out of bed. To pull back the curtains and to look outside.

A subtle *thrumming* begins to reverberate through my bones. I can feel it sending shivers through the furniture, and it takes every ounce of control not to fall into a mad panic.

*There’s always an explanation. There’s always an explanation*, I think to myself, over and over and over.

…

…Yeah.

There’s always an explanation, until one day, there *isn’t.*

&#x200B;

*It’ll be construction-works. Late night construction works, that’s all.*

&#x200B;

I prepare to roll over. To try my very best to return to sleep. To ignore the shifting atmosphere and to get back to my dreams. But a tap on the window sends my blood racing, and gritting my teeth, steeling myself and unable to take it a second later, I throw off my sheets in an altogether rather uncharacteristic burst of courage, and I stride to the window.

I haul back the curtains, braced to see something staring back at me from beyond the glass…

&#x200B;

…But, no.

&#x200B;

There’s nothing there.

Nothing looking back at me. No source of lights… Just a night-time view of my back garden, and the neighbors’ gardens, all bathed in darkness.

My breathing settles, just a little. Just for a moment. A brief, false-hope laden moment, before I shoot a reactionary glance up to the sky. An involuntary response to some movement there.

&#x200B;

My pupils narrow. What I see in the sky is difficult to describe. 

I am drawn to what I see, and yet, it frightens me like nothing I’ve ever experienced before. 

I cannot look away.

&#x200B;

Sections of the sky… vast, sprawling sections, are moving against each other in the darkness. Partly hidden behind the clouds they form curious, hard-edged shapes… they inter-lock with one another and fade in and out of view, their colors not quite matching those of the air around them. They do not look natural in any sense of the word, and as I watch, it becomes clear that they are all parts of a greater whole. A section of an enormous ring, or an arc, slowly rotating around. It is difficult to tell where the sky ends and the shifting, grinding shapes begin. They rumble softly, almost imperceptibly, crackling like distant thunder.

I am awe-struck. Terrified, and frozen in place. What I am seeing defies the laws of reason. Of *sense*. Another bar of light shivers its way down the glass and washes over the garden, but its immediate source is not obvious. I cannot see what is actually *casting* the light, and besides, my gaze remains fixed on the colossal, softly swirling mechanisms in the sky. 

The spell is finally broken the same way it was cast. By a movement. Though, this time from below, instead of above.

My eyes flicker down to the garden. To my backyard. It is small and one of many; fence-posts mark the boundaries between mine, and those of my neighbors.

My yard has a few trees, and a lone shed of tools. There is a soccer ball too, kicked idly  into its current position a few days ago.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And between them creeps a figure far taller and far skinnier than any person I have ever seen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A sharp intake of cold breath forces its way down into my lungs.

The figure is shadowed. It is too dark to make out any particular features.

They do not appear to be wearing any clothes.

The joints in their elbows and knees do not bend in the way they are supposed to.

It is hard to see in the darkness, but the figure does not appear to be disturbing the grass in any way as they move.

They move too *quickly.*

And in seconds, the figure is gone. Lost to the deeper shadows of the neighboring fence, and of the wall to the house.

Blood rushes through my ears. Light-headed, I turn at once and open my bedroom door to the long, dark hallway of my house. It feels like the walls spin around me as I walk to my parents’ room, one hasty foot in front of the other.

“Mom!” I call out. “D-Dad!”

&#x200B;

Their door is open.

&#x200B;

I step into the room, hands clenched with hope. Hope that they will explain. That they will make everything alright.

&#x200B;

But they are not there.

&#x200B;

The sheets have been thrown off the bed, and are carelessly folded back on themselves, drooping towards the floor.

The window is open.

Cool night air filters in, and one of the curtains flutters lazily, ever so slightly shifting in the breeze.

“MOM!” I call out, louder now. Looking around wildly. I swivel and head back into the hall, calling down into the inky, void-like depths of the landing below. “DAD! WHERE ARE YOU?”

But there comes no response.

&#x200B;

Just the creak of the house.

That subtle, soft humming. 

…And the rapid pattering of feet against the hardwood floor below.

&#x200B;

I throw myself backwards against the wall, staring down into the gloom below through the bannisters of the stairs, but it is too dark. I cannot make anything out. I could turn on the light if I wished, but the switch is attached to the wall, over at the very top of the stairs. I cannot bear the thought of making myself so vulnerable, of the potential threat of some unknown nightmare scrambling up from the darkness towards me, so I instead retreat rapidly to my room, slamming the door shut perhaps a little too loudly behind me.

&#x200B;

*…It's in the house.*

*Whatever I saw outside, is in the house.*

*And my parents are gone.*

&#x200B;

A sob wracks my throat and I struggle to swallow it back down, sweating and rubbing my hands across my eyes.

I shoot a feverish glance back out through the window, peeking from behind the curtain.

The shapes in the sky appear closer now. Ever-shifting, locking and unlocking with each other, slow, purposeful movements that give the impression of colossal weight, or density. 

“Please, just leave me alone”, I whisper. “Just go away, please”.

&#x200B;

I hear the sound of something scrambling up the stairs.

&#x200B;

My body reacts before my brain. I throw myself up against the door as irregular footsteps creep across the hall towards my room.

It knows where I am. It knows that I am here.

“NO!” I scream out loud, “I DON’T WANT TO GO! I DON’T WANT TO GO!”

The door thuds. I shoot a look down to my right as the handle jumps, then turns.

“NO!”

I am pushed along the floor as the door starts to open, but with a shout of terror-stricken defiance I dig my heels into the carpet and shove back with all my might. 

The door re-closes.

“DON’T TAKE ME!” I shout, my words thick with desperate emotion. “PLEASE JUST DON’T TAKE ME! I DON’T WANT TO GO! I DON’T WANT TO GO!”

The door stops moving.

My heart pounds as I wait, chest rising and falling as the tension builds, tighter and tighter…

&#x200B;

...And then, it simply fades away. 

&#x200B;

The thing behind the door decides to leave.

I hear its footsteps go back across the hall, and back they go down the stairs.

&#x200B;

When I am certain it has left the floor I dart back to the window and stare out into my backyard.

&#x200B;

The view below me is illuminated, now.

The grass and the shed and the trees and the fence,  they’re all lit up in a sickly, watery yellow. It is not clear where the light is actually coming from. There is no obvious, visible source. It simply sticks to the objects below like paint. Localized. It does not overflow into any of the neighbors’ gardens.

And in the centre of this light and looking up towards the sky, are two silhouetted figures.

&#x200B;

Two figures I recognize.

&#x200B;

*…My parents.*

&#x200B;

They are facing the opposite way, with their backs towards me, but there is no question as to who they are. I’d recognize them anywhere, even from just the backs of their heads.

&#x200B;

I stare in bewilderment, in disbelief, and I bang my hand on the glass, but they do not turn around. 

“MOM! DAD!” I cry out loud in distress, fumbling with the window and trying to get it open, but still they don’t respond.

The light in the garden intensifies, and my parents raise their arms to the sky.

With a click and a thud I finally get the window open, throwing it wide and screaming out into the night. There’s no way they don’t hear me. There’s no way.

…But my parents do not react to my voice.

&#x200B;

The shapes in the sky draw together beyond the clouds. The thunder increases and spark-like lightning crackles between them.

How in the hell no-one else is awake to see this, I do not know. I could not say.

But the speed of the anomaly’s spinning up above grows faster. 

Tears stream warm down my cheeks in sharp contrast to the cold night air, and for a long, terrible second that silence returns. The complete absence of any kind of noise or sound or rustle or hum. Just total empty, space-like silence.

That same shudder of energy is sent rumbling through the house and the lights flash bright, and then that’s it.

&#x200B;

…

&#x200B;

…That’s it.

&#x200B;

The soft subtle, everyday sounds of the night return, but where once there was a behemoth in the sky, there is nothing. Where once there was a subtle vibration through the floor, a humming in the back of my head, there is nothing.

&#x200B;

The house creaks.

I wipe my eyes and stare for a moment out into the night, then I slam my window and race to my parents’ room, forgetting for a moment the terrible threat of the intruder that crept its way through the house.

Not that it mattered.

The intruder is gone.

…As, it seems, are my parents.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

It’s been five years since that night.

My life in this time was quite *difficult* for the most part, to put it lightly, though things have been looking up a little more recently.

I never forgot that experience, though. How could I?

I do not know what happened to my parents. I do not know who took them. And I do not know if it was partly my fault. I still carry a tremendous burden of guilt. It was too much. Far too much for a child, especially.

But there are always answers to be found. There is still hope.

I will uncover what happened to my parents, and if they are alive, I will bring them home.

*I promise.*

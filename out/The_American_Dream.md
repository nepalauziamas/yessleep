I live the true American dream. Everyone wants me, I’m most well known man in my state, hell I’m even famous on the internet.

Well you might be asking, what do I do for a living? Who am I? I must be some big politician, TikTok star, lawyer?

As much as I hate to say it, I am a tiktok star.  You can call me M.I’ve been featured in many peoples videos actually, Some of you reading this may be one of those lucky individuals.

However, every life isn’t exactly perfect is it? You see, a couple of months back I was paid for what I thought would just a showman ship of my skill set. Oh…was I so so very wrong.

Let me start from the beginning of when this took place, I was in my store. I always chose to model my own brand. Everything was fine until I heard one of my employees talk to a young man.

After doing some discussion, she finally came to me.

“Time for you to show em what you got, have fun!” She told me.

“What? He’s just 16?” I asked suddenly but I soon was shown the staff book shutting me up instantly.

. I was in the car with this young man, ready to discuss business.
 
The boy started getting rather upset when we started talking, I guess he was having a bad day.

He told me about how he was being picked on at school, how he wanted things to change. He said he just wanted friends, people to be able to not look at him in disgust…nor as a loner.

I told him that we can go the the soccer field near his house to ease his mind off things, he agreed and we were soon on our way.

Once we got to the field he got out first then I followed suit.

Once we were done playing he truly did seem to feel better, it seemed that a friendship was truly starting blossom.

We started hanging out regularly after that, he told me all his problems, I tried my best to give him advice. It helped in some ways but ultimately, he became very depressed.

At this point I say it was nearing winter, with the snow and cold we barely got to hang out anymore. I thought the kid had forgotten about me.

Until one day, he contacted me crying. Christmas was horrible for him. He told me about how his mother and father was divorced, this of course caused issues when the both of them.

The house was abusive, his mother was usually beaten in some way nightly for months on end, I even heard it myself.

“How…how do I fix this…ca…can you fix this?” He asked me with tears rolling down his eyes.

“I can’t fix it per say, but you can if I help you, it’s just, wouldn’t you want to try other things before I come in?” I asked nervously. My words didn’t even register

“ I’m tired of seeing her be treated like this. It’s time to end it.” He said with nothing but pure rage In his eyes.

He suddenly grabbed me and took me downstairs to where his mother and father was. He was on top of her while she struggled for air.

I heard this boy scream at the top of his lungs to get off before….it all went black.
Dazed and confused I looked around and realized I was back at home.

I didn’t hear from the boy for months, but one day, I heard him knocking on my door. It was open so he soon let himself in. He embraced me In a hug.

“God did I miss you. Thank you. Your like a superhero to stop all the bad guys.” He said quietly as he hugged me. 

“I’m just doing what I am supposed to, and what you want me to. Don’t thank me.” I said 

We soon started hanging out like we used to after that.

The woods, mountain ranges, and obstacle courses, we did it all. Thankfully it was summer break for him. During this time we spent almost everyday together, his mother didn’t want me around so we had to find places like these to play.

Finally when school rolled around, hoping it would be a new year. It didn’t go as planned, I heard his mother talking about how much he’s bullied.

His grades started to drop horribly, he thought having his dad out of the house would be better but it wasn’t his main problem. His problem all stemmed from his bullies.

“Fuck all of them. Fuck Jared, Smithy, and David. I just wish they would disappear. I just don’t know what to do.” He told me crying in his pillow.


“You know what. Let’s go talk to them at school on Monday. You always win with your words.” He told me.

As much as I pleaded otherwise, begging him to just seek help, we met them at school that Monday.

The day was started early. He woke me up and we was already making our way to his car. The whole drive there had me in a state of uneasiness.

What do I say? Who am I evens going to be talking to? Either way, whoever it was he would show me and we would have a quick chat.

As he pulled in the parking lot, he looked as nervous as I was. We got out the car together. We greeted the lady at the front desk. At first she wouldn’t let us in, he shoved me and boom. she let us in and all I had to do was say hi.

He wasn’t lying about being a outcast. Everyone screamed and would run away from us with every step we took. It was more sad than anything.

Finally we was greeted with who I was guessing was his bullies. Although, they seemed more apologetic than mean. He told them how he forgave them, he pushed me out of no where and of course I had to say hi to his bullies.

They must have been tried from gym class because they all instantly sat down and became silent ignoring me. Now I know what he meant by rude.

By the time we was done with the conversation, a man in a blue uniform told us to stop and we needed to leave. I understood I mean, I’m a stranger walking into a school.

The man in blue  slowly  walked to us and escorted us out. After that, we was suddenly outside.

They told me that he didn’t have permission to take me with him so, they said I had to go back to work. After resting at a place the man in blue directed me for a couple days, I was soon modeling again. Waiting for my next client. Living the American dream.

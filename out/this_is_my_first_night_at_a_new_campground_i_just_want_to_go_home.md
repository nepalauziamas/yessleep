so, i'm nikki. i'm 17(non binary), and a junior in high school.

my family has always been super into camping. ever since i was a little kid, i remember the trips we'd take. from summer nights spent outside, to halloween spent at campgrounds, to appreciating winter scenes, and appreciating nature in the spring, my childhood is full of fun camping memories. it's something i hope to do forever.

now, my last day of school was today, and i had a half day. my parents picked me up from school, followed by my younger brother and sister, and we headed straight to the campground. it's very new to us, as we moved at the beginning of the school year, and haven't yet had time to explore. all of the reviews were amazing, and everyone said how clean it is, how friendly everyone is, and how nice some of the trails are. i was beyond excited!

we got here fairly quickly. we parked our trailer, as well as set up our tents, and then we got our bikes and went to the store at the bottom of the mountain. a few minutes into the ride, i thought i heard my sister whisper my name, so i turned around and said, "rosie, is everything alright?" she looked confused, so i thought maybe i'd just been hearing things, "oh, never mind, i think it was just the wind." i smiled, my sister smiling back before speeding up to race our brother, cali. i felt uneasy.

still, the rest of the day passed along with no issues. the place really is stunning. there's a small hill that has a bridge to another small hill, the water beneath possibly the clearest i've seen, a field of newly blooming flowers on either side. the walk was a beautiful reminder of why i love nature. i was completely at peace...until i wasn't.

my family had gone back to the campsite to start a campfire, while i stayed on the hills. i could see the spot from up there, so everyone was fine with it. i sat facing the water, a line of tall, dark trees behind me. i took in the smell of the spring forest, familiar and comforting as always. until i heard a scream. it sounded a lot like rosie screaming, so i immediately jumped up. i turned around to see somebody. but not rosie. a tall, black, shadowy figure, but with pigtails identical to my sisters. i stared, the creature's breathing getting louder, before running as fast as i could back to the camping spot.

"m-mom...dad...there's a creature up there! it has red eyes and it screamed!" i cried. they looked confused, "honey, it's okay, you're okay! nothing here will hurt you." "no, please! it sounded just like rosie screaming...it had her pigtails!" their comforting smiles dropped, "where is rosie?"

"she came back here, with you guys."

my parents shook their heads. their eyes widened with shock, but the saddest looks i'd ever seen.

"no, nikki, she stayed with you." my heart dropped.

i don't know who took my sister. did she disappear? is that...thing?...trying to pretend it's her? i need answers. and i want to go home. we all do. but i wont be going home without my sister.

Someone said the right thing, if you want to start your tour of the different cultures of India, you have to start with Durga puja in west Bengal. The rich history that surrounds the festival and the grandness and devotion of people is truly something to Marvel at. The story goes as such-:

During the time when a demon, born out of a curse, was meditating and the god Bhrama asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted a boon that would make him invincible to men. Bhramha granted him this boon. After receiving it, he wreaked havoc on heaven and earth. The gods, distraught, went to the 'Trimurti' (three person) 
Bhramha, Vishnu and Shiva. And with their strength, created a godess called Duga And gave her weapons. After 9 days of fighting, finally she defeated him on the 10th day. This day is know as 'Vijaydashami' (10th day victory)


I was out with my friends during the puja, visiting places and having fun and Eating good food. On the fifth day though, i got lost in the huge crowds that surrounds the place. I was looking for them when i saw a alleyway with darkness that fought with the light pomp and glitter of the outside. No light, no people. I saw a old house with lights off the whole house. It looked like it was so old that even my great grandfather would not recognise it. There was a woman, even with the dark hallway, her face was covered in darkness darker than the darkness itself. Her hands could be clearly seen. Her hands were covered in glass bangles and intricate 'ratanchoor', a jewellery that has 5 rings attached with gold strings to the wrist with a bangle.


She was singing a really creepy and old song that was by what i heard, 'Agomoni aalo' (coming heavenly light), a song sung on mahalaya to signal the arrival of godess Durga. I saw as she reached the end of the verandah and there were pictures of old people and a young looking man with herself. I knew it was her because she lifted up the oil lamp near her face once. It looked like as if a godess had taken on human flesh.As she passed by, the candle infront of all the portraits lit up by themselves. She then saw the painting of the man with herself and then stopped there for a few seconds before walking by and continuing singing that song. Then she saw that photo of her marrying the man and then unleashed the most horrifying and blood curdling scream anyone possibly has ever heard. And then i  looked on in horror as she screamed in Bengali "YOU DIDNT FEEL BAD FOR ME!" over and over until she started weeping and screaming and running across the verandah saying the same thing.

 I then watched on in horror as she said again in Bengali "what's the point of living anymore?" And dropped the oil lamp on herself, burning her flesh as it fell down like melted wax. I only remember my eyesight fading to black as i stumbled backwards and fell down.


I found myself at my parents house and when i woke up, i asked them the time. 2 days, i had been gone for 2 days before my uncle found me there, laying unconscious. I told them about the incident, that woman, and her outfits. Their faces ran cold as the told me that houses like that were often of rich landlords. She then told me a story that was passed on through generations. That a woman named MalatiDevi lived in that house. She, had married a man older than her by 5 years. They were living happily until she caught him sleeping with her sister. In sadness, she wailed and in front of her servants, wiped off the vermillion off her forehead, broke her glass bangles and ran towards her room, and came out in a white saree, a custom followed by widows as they were not allowed to wear colour.


 The sad thing was, it was their anniversary that day, she was wearing an exquisite red saree, beautiful ornaments on her hair with flowers and golden jewellery and was just walking in to surprise him. He tried to console her, but she would not listen. She waited until  he left on a business trip and then burnt herself on the first day of Durga puja, the day her favourite godess came to earth, she left for heaven. I felt so sad for her, i spent a lot of money and bought an expensive red saree, ornaments and glass bangles and a statue of godess Durga and left on the side table under her picture.

I again on the next puja went to infront of her house and watched as she, standing on the balcony, wearing my red saree, ornaments and holding an oil lamp and that statue of durga, held up that lamp to her face, and smiled and waved at me, while dissipating into smoke that went into a room, on the door-: The face of godess Durga carved on the door


I am now happy that she has atleast some relief in the afterlife and that i was a part of it.

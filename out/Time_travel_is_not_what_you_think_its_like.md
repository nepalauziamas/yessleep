My name is Clark. I am one of three people who can truthfully say they have time traveled. It is not what you think it’s like.

I’m not really certain how they selected us. I was working on my bachelor’s degree at my State University when I was approached by the team. “Project bTaOw33” is what they called it. No cool name like “Project-X” or “Project Alpha Time Warp” or something along those lines. Just bTaOw33—whatever that means.

They approached me and asked if I’d like to take part in an experiment in exchange for my tuition being paid for. I only had a year left in school, but those two semesters were going to cost me $32,000. So, of course I said yes. When I asked what the experiment was, they told me it was extremely secretive. I would be finding out details the day of, then I could decide to back out if I didn’t want to participate.

About 6 weeks went by and I was basically on-call to be ready to go whenever they needed me. Finally, I got the call. I live in Atlanta, and the team had the three of us meet up in a parking deck about 20 minutes outside the city. Once there, we all got in one of those short school buses, and they took us out to the Northern Georgia mountains.

It was about a two-hour drive and we didn’t really get much time to get to know each other. We were under strict rules not to reveal information about ourselves or talk to each other on the bus ride over. The last couple of miles were on a rocky dirt road leading down a mountain.

The bus parked in a small, maybe half-acre stretch of grass. The grass was freshly mowed, and I could tell by sight and smell. The alcove of grass was enclosed by large trees from the surrounding forest. 

“Alright,” a man stood up from his seat at the front of the bus, “we’re here. I’ll brief you all once we get inside the house.”

As we got off the bus one-by-one, we could see that in the center of the clearing was a building. It had a one very large window on one side, basically encompassing that entire wall. Every other wall was black on the outside, and I could see through the window that the inside was painted white.

There was a large, silver, metal ring that surrounded the house. It came about three inches off the freshly mowed grass, was a foot wide, and had lights coming from drilled holes all the way around it.

“Watch your step, and please do not step on top of this ring,” the same man said, “once we get inside just go ahead and take a seat.”

We all stepped over the ring and made our way into the house. The “house” as the man called it, was made up of only one room. Inside, there were four chairs around a rather large circular table. The chairs, table, walls, and the one lamp were all white—the only thing that wasn’t white in the room were the pair of bookshelves against each wall, both empty.

After we all took our seats, the man introduced himself.

“Alrighty, welcome, welcome. My name is Dr. Olsen. I’m glad you all decided to take part in this—to take part in history. As we told you all, this is extremely sensitive information. After my explanation of what this experiment consists of, I’ll ask you if you want to continue. Understand?”

“What if we don’t want to continue?” a woman said, about my age with fiery red hair. “Then we know this super-secret information, right? And you’re going to let us walk out of here?”

The man gave a smile. He knew this would be asked.

“Yes, you are free to leave here knowing what the experiment consists of. However, the University and I are confident of three things. One—you won’t want to leave. Two—the University’s attorneys are rather powerful, and you already signed the NDA’s. And three—no one will believe you if you tell them.”

Silence filled the room. The redhead slouched back in her chair, a nonverbal “well, go on then.”

“The experiment,” Dr. Olsen continued, “is Time Travel.”

I smiled but wasn’t sure why. The others seemed to snort a little in amusement. The tensions in the room seemed to release.

“Now, now, I know it sounds—you know, crazy. I’ve heard it all before. I’m not asking you to believe in me. I’m asking you to just sit in this room, observe, and tell me what happens.” 

We all nodded in agreement, a couple of OKs’ filled the air. The doctor carried on, “Alright, this is how it’ll work. I’m going to drive up to the control center—it’s just about five minutes up the mountain. I have a couple of colleagues there as well. From there, I will ‘flip the switch’ in laymen’s terms.”

When Dr. Olsen began his next sentence, he leaned forward and his face took on a very stern, angry father quality.

“Do not leave this room. After I walk out, do. not. leave. Do not leave until I come back down the mountain, walk back inside this room, and tell you that you can leave. I have done this experiment before, but not on humans. I know it works. I know it’s safe. I can promise you, this is safe. I *cannot* promise your safety though, if you leave the house.”

I remember the air shifting to an uneasy feel.

“Are—are you sure this safe? What’ve you tested it on? What’s it gonna feel like?” A scrawny blonde guy said, who couldn’t have been older than 21.

The Doctor continued, “I know it is safe. No animal I have used has been affected by this, I’ve used rats and progressed up to dogs. No bruises, no cuts, no change in behavior. And to be honest with you all, I don’t know what you should expect. I’m not sure if it feels like a tingle, a sting, a pinch, or anything else. This is the first human trial, which is why you need to pay attention to any sensation you feel.”

“Wait, okay, if we *are* actually about to time travel, where—or when—are we traveling to?” I asked.

“You will be launching 3 hours into the future. Once activated at the control site, this building will disappear. My team and I will be on standby for three hours, then, *poof*—the house is back with all of you in it, three hours into the future.”

A long silence followed. I’m skeptic of just about anything, but something about Dr. Olsen’s tone, his body language, the way he was explaining it—it was hard for me to doubt. He was dead serious. When it was clear there were no more questions, Dr. Olsen looked at his watch, stood up, and cleared his throat.

“Alrighty then, it’s 1:22 PM right now, so by the time I make it to the control site it should be just before 1:30. Warm-up only takes about two minutes, so we’ll mark your projected arrival time at 4:30. Are there any other questions or concerns?”

No one spoke. “OK—I’ll see you all in three hours. Or from your perspective, just a couple of minutes.” The doctor winked, nodded, and closed the door behind him after adding, “safe travels!”

The three of us stood from our chairs as we watched the Doctor drive off. Then we all turned to one another, the tension, yet again, easing.

“Well, he sure knows how to make an entrance and an exit,” the redhead said.

“No kidding,” the blonde kid answered, “uh—well, nice to meet you, fellow time travelers.” We all chuckled a bit, that nervous sort of laughter. “My name’s Ryan.”

“I’m Clark,” I replied back with a handshake to follow.

“Emma,” she said, with a smile that could make any man’s, or woman’s, head turn.

We exchanged pleasantries, talked about our schooling and how we were selected. Emma was the first to ask what we were all thinking. “So, what’s the chance this is legit? Don’t get me wrong, I would love to be the world’s first time traveler, but I feel like this is going to end in a dud, or we are just being pranked.”

 “Yeah!” Ryan replied, “When he was explaining everything, I thought it may be a prank. Like, this may be an actual experiment from the university, but it’s an experiment to see if they can convince people they time traveled.”

“That’s meta,” I quipped.

“Oh, guys! Guys, look!” Emma was staring out the large window. The ring that surrounded the building was slowly getting brighter. It looked like a hundred laser pointers slowly brightening, shining up into the overcast sky.

“Does this mean we are in the two-minute warm up?” I said, already knowing the answer.

“I guess so,” Emma started, “God my heart is racing.”

“Mine too.”

“Same.”

We all stood. Perfectly still, watching those skinny beams of light growing brighter, until it was nearly blinding. I turned to look at Emma. Her pupils were closing to the size of a pencil tip, maybe smaller. Her gaze, along with Ryan’s, was locked on the beams. I could see their faces getting more illuminated each second that passed. Second after second it just kept getting brighter—brighter and brighter and brighter until it was like we were being engulfed by the sun.

And in less than a second, it was dark.

I chose my words carefully—less than a second. It was not like turning off a light. It was not like shutting your eyes. It was faster. It was instant.

I saw Emma’s pupils quickly grow large, as the absence of light from out the window met her retina. The inside of the house was still illuminated, thanks to one lamp in the main room.

Outside the window was nothing—not night time, not black, not pitch black—nothing. It almost had a color to it, but one I cannot explain. It gave off no light. It was the color that a blind man sees. It was the color of our sleeping nights in between dreams. It was the color of death. It was nothing.

We all kind of looked around after about a minute of silence, all staring out the same window into a void of absence.  

“What the fuck is happening?” Emma said in a shaky voice.

“I—I don’t—” I began.

“My heart stopped beating.” Ryan said bluntly.

I saw Emma raise two fingers to her neck. I didn’t have to. I could feel it. It was one of the first things I noticed. When I was staring at Emma’s pupils as the light reached its crescendo, my heart was racing. And as soon as the light disappeared, so did the rhythmic thumps of my heart.

“Fuck—fuck fuck fuck what the FUCK is happening?” Emma began to panic.

“Wait, wait. This is just a part of it,” Ryan started, “I’m *really* freaked out too, trust me. Obviously, something is happening. If you believe the Doctor, which I’m starting to, we may be, you know, traveling through time.”

I actually agreed with him, “Yeah—yeah, you’re right. We just need to pay attention to this so we can explain later. Okay, heartbeats stopped, check. We’re still alive, check. And that—that, void. Abyss. Thing. Check.

We turned to the window in unison.

“I don’t like looking at it,” Emma said. “It’s unnatural. It’s—I dunno, not supposed to *be*. It’s not black but it has no light, I don’t think.”

She wasn’t wrong.

“I’m kind of glad I don’t have a heartbeat right now because I think I’d have a heart attack,” I joked. Anxious laughs filled the small space.

We finally moved from our spots where we were staring out the window. It was a relief to move around the room, and I’m not sure why. We were quiet for a couple of minutes. Emma was sitting in a chair with her knees tucked up to her chest, occasionally checking her nonexistent pulse or looking at her hands. Ryan leaned against the back wall staring out the window. I pulled up a chair next to Emma’s and joined in her quiet atmosphere.

Our peaceful still was broken with Ryan’s words, “Clark. Emma. There’s something out there.”

We looked at him, then out the window. “What do you mean?” Emma asked.

“Out there. I can see things.”

“Your mind is playing tricks on you. You know, like when you’re in a pitch-black room, your mind will make you see lights and shapes and stuff.” I said.

“No,” he countered, “it’s there. Look. Look out there. You can see, eh, I don’t know how to describe it. Just look.” 

Emma and I both turned our attention once again to the emptiness. It was still. It was quiet. It was unmoving—abnormal. Yet it felt like it was meant to be there. Like it was at home, and we were its intruders. 

“I don’t see anything,” Emma said.

“Me either.”

Ryan continued to stare out, unflinching. Emma and I stayed at the table, fiddling with our fingers and nervously finger-tapping. I’m not sure how much time had passed before the silence was broken. All I know is it felt like a long time—maybe an hour, maybe two.

“Well, this is taking quite some time, isn’t it?” Emma said.

“Seriously, I feel like we’ve been in here for a couple of hours,” I responded.

“No,” Ryan said, “not even a second has passed.”

Emma and I glanced looks of confusion at each other.

“What’d you mean?”

“Not even a second has passed.” He repeated. His gaze was still locked on the void. “Time doesn’t pass in here. When you look into it. Into *it*. You see. No time has passed. No time will pass. When you look into it, it all makes sense.”

Emma and I locked eyes once again, yet this time it was less confusion, and more terror.

I spoke up, “C’mon man, stop messing with us.”

He did not reply. He did not blink.

Days passed, I think. Emma and I sat and talked a lot. We did not grow hungry, tired, or thirsty. We did not have to use the bathroom. We came to a few realizations. One was that there was no temperature in the room. It was an absence of any heat or coolness. Air was nonexistent. After roughly twelve hours, or so we estimated, our bodies began to not breathe automatically. We didn’t need oxygen.

The other realization was about that void. Ryan had been staring off into it for the entirety of our stay, save for the first couple of minutes. He has not moved. He has not blinked. Sometimes he mumbles something about time or the universe, but most of it is gibberish. Emma and I decided that maybe something *is* in there. We can’t see it, but Ryan can, and it’s driving him insane. We decided it’s best not to look at it for too long.

After weeks of being stuck in that room, Emma and I were growing increasingly restless. We started arguing about little things, and eventually stopped talking altogether. Sometimes I would hear her sob, trying to be quiet. I spent a lot of my time crying as well. No tears could come out, though.

Emma and I ignoring each other was halted one day after Ryan simply stated, loud and clear, “I’m going out.” It was the first time Emma and I had even looked at each other in a couple days. It was the first Ryan has spoken coherent words in weeks. He did not look at us when he said it.

And for some reason, neither of us protested. Maybe out of boredom, depression, or curiosity, we did not stop him. He walked over to the glass door and stood for a moment, never taking his eyes off the emptiness.

He spoke to us, still facing the nothingness, “I’m going to learn its secrets. Its power. I will become a God. And it welcomes me.” He opened the door.

He reached his hand out into the void. It looked like an optical illusion. Exactly where the door frame was, as soon as he broke through that plane, his hand disappeared. All I could see was his wrist with nothing attached. 

He brought his arm back inside the room.

His hand was missing. There was exposed bone, flesh, and tissue. But he did not bleed. He did not scream. 

He smiled. 

He then walked out into the void, looking like a ghost walking through a wall.

Emma and I stared in horror. She ran over to me and we cried together for a while.

She said seven words to me, through thick sobs, that chilled me to the bone—the first real sensation I’ve had since coming here.

“Are we going to be here forever?”

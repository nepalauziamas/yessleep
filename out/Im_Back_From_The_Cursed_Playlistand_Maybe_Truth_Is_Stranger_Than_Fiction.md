I knew I’d only have one more shot at saving my brother. After the nurses caught me attempting to enter the dreams of my comatose brother Seth, they forbid me from ever being alone with him. Back at home, I thought up ways to sneak back into the hospital–each more ridiculous than the last. I was too young to look like a doctor or nurse–but not a member of the cooking or cleaning staff. From the parking lot, I observed their schedules, their uniforms, how they wore their badges–everything. I had to visit a lot of workwear stores before I got the look right, but two days later I felt like I was ready. I walked up to the loading dock while they were rolling out the dumpsters: a sweaty and disgusting job that required complete attention. I took the service elevator to my brother's floor, made it to his room, and barred the door with a chair. 

It wasn’t easy to fall asleep with my heart thundering and my nerves on edge, but I slowly managed to calm myself down. I turned out the lights, closed the blinds, put headphones on my brother and myself…then prepared for what would come next. 

*A clanging, echoing, industrial sound. A dark interior space. Chilly and seemingly endless. Patches of evening light that pour through gaps in the ceiling reveal filthy cracked concrete, dead weeds, enormous rusty doors.*

*The abandoned warehouse where you and Seth played, back in the old neighborhood–back before Seth's accident.* 

*You focus all your memory, all your imagination, on finding your brother. You heave one of the sliding doors open; it makes a horrific shriek that echoes away into the distance…but there's only darkness on the other side.*

*Behind you, movement. A shadow passes through the patches of light. You're not sure whether you should run towards it–or away from it. But what choice is there? It could be Seth. You follow it through the narrow gap of another half open door, and it stops–just beyond the reach of the light.* 

*"Seth!" you cry, grabbing your brother's hand and spinning him around.* 

*From its wig to its clothes, the mannequin* looks *like your brother.* 

*There's a crude expression of fear painted on its face with makeup, and a thick line of lipstick across its neck makes it look like its throat has been slit.* 

*You’ve been going about this all wrong. You need to find the memory first, then remember your brother’s place in it. A dusty wind blows toward you from the darkness of the warehouse, bringing with it the reek of rotting meat and the scraping sound of metal being dragged across concrete. You haven’t got much time.* 

*On the far side of a heap of rebar and rubble, another door. You sprint to it, trying to think of somewhere safe, familiar, where you can find your brother before something else finds you.* 

*You remember Bring-Your-Kid-To-Work-Day in your father’s office. Playing with doodads on his desk, wandering through the cubicles, reading picture books in the oversized chairs.* That *was a happy memory for both of you. Grabbing the door handle, you focus all your senses on it:*

*The rough texture of the gray carpet.*

*That office smell, a weird blend of cheap coffee, hot plastic, and eraser dust.* 

*Clacking keyboards, muted water-cooler conversations, staticky classic rock and intercom announcements.*

*You slide open the abandoned factory door–your father’s corporate office waits on the other side. You step through, leaving a solid cubicle wall where the factory door had been.* 

*You remember that Seth used to hide behind the fake fern beside the receptionist’s desk. Sure enough–*

*“Why here, of all places?” Your brother climbs out from behind the plastic plant. Three long, claw-shaped gashes extend down his left arm. He notices you staring. “Don’t ask” He leans his head against the wall, sighs. “I’m sorry I dragged you into this, little bro. When I first started falling asleep to this playlist, I realized that I could revisit the days before the accident, back when I was actually happy. I could walk through those memories with my own two feet…even if some things felt…off. The more time I spent here, the harder it got to go back. I started smoking more, drinking more…and it wasn’t long before I forgot to set an alarm. By the time I realized what this place really was, it was too late. My endless dream was an endless nightmare…until you came for me.”*

*THUMP.* 

*It's as loud and heavy as a giant’s footstep. Suddenly, the warbling, scratchy office muzak is replaced by something shrieking and industrial, like if a hard drive could scream.* 

*THUMP.*

*THUMP.*

*“Shit.* This *is why I didn’t understand why you chose this memory. Remember Mr. Reynolds?”*

*“You mean dad’s creepy boss?” Kevin Renolds. You remember how much he scared you as a child. The way his lips smiled but his eyes didn’t. The way he stood so close, always looking for an excuse to pat or squeeze or touch…the cruel way he lorded over his employees.*

*Maybe the past wasn’t so perfect after all.* 

*“Right.” Seth starts leading you away through the maze of cubicles. The footsteps are joined by heavy, labored breathing–just like Mr. Reynolds’. “This place has a way of magnifying your fears. It turns them into something deadly…as if that bastard wasn’t dangerous enough already.”*

*“What?”*

*“I guess they didn’t tell you. You were probably too young. Kevin Reynolds was arrested for pedophilia and murder. They, uh, found a dead kid in his trunk, little bro. He only ever got caught because he attached some of his snuff pictures to a company email…”*

*THUMP.  WHEEZE. THUMP.* 

*You look over your shoulder and see an enormous shadow turning the corner–a figure as large and imposing to you now as Kevin Reynolds had been when you were a child. Seth yanks you into a cubicle. You both get on your hands and knees and crawl underneath the office furniture. There’s only a rolling chair between you and–*

*THUMP. WHEEZE. THUMP.* 

*From your hiding spot beneath the desk, you see fingers–each as wide as your forearm–curling around the top of the cubicle. A thing that looks* almost *like Mr. Reynolds peers over, searching, its beady eyes like buttons in the fleshy mass of its face.* 

*WHEEZE. THUMP. WHEEZE.* 

*The thing continues stalking through the office…but it will definitely be back. You crawl out toward the corridor and see an enormous brown leather shoe disappear around the corner. The door is too far away, and even if it wasn’t, you’re both too on-edge to remember a way out of this. Seth starts for the door.*

*“Wait!” you hiss. Something has just occurred to you. “What year did Reynolds get busted?”* 

*“Ninety-eight, I think. Spring. Dad had just got promoted, and we took a family vacation right after…”*

*You look at the cartoon calendar on the cubicle wall: April 27th 1998.* 

*You wonder if Kevin Reynolds sent out that email by accident…or if it was a warning sent from somewhere else. A place like here.* 

*“We’ve got to get to his office somehow.”* 

*“What?!” Seth blurts. “Why?! We gotta get out of here.”* 

*THUMP. WHEEZE. WHEEZE.*

*The footsteps stop. You’ve been heard.* 

*“Just trust me!” You grab Seth’s hand and drag him deeper into the fluorescent depths of the office. The Reynolds-thing thunders toward you at a pace that should be impossible for its size.* 

*You remember his office: thick faux-wood door, ‘MANAGER’ on a brass plaque. It’s unlocked. Seth locks the door and braces it with everything he can while you squiggle the mouse on Reynolds’ Windows 95 computer. Outside he’s rattling the handle, shrieking, scratching and slamming at the door–*

*You find the files. Attach them. CC the entire company. Hit send.* 

*The splintering wood won’t hold much longer now. Beneath the violent barrage another sound grows, beeping and buzzing. You grab Seth and hold on tight–*

*And you both wake up, together, in the hospital room.* 

Seth and I wrote these notes after the reunion with our family and the doctors’ tests finally came to an end. To keep it simple, we explained that I’d just played some of Seth’s favorite music, which had led him back to himself. So little is understood about comas that the doctors accepted it without question. I think they were just happy to see him recover. 

I don’t know if finding that memory and sending those files was the point all along. I don’t know if all the steps in our lives led us there, just for that purpose–or if the phantom playlist was just one of those inexplicable things between sleeping and waking. 

I’m just glad to be living in the present–with my older brother by my side.

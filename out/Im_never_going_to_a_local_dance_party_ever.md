Its been a few hours and i just started to shake from fear less and less. What was supposed to be a fun time with my buddies became a nightmare inducing experience over a few seconds and one very, very bad decision....

I am from a small town that is located in a very small country. It's one of 3 Baltic states, so our mythology and culture, especially old traditions, might be shocking to some. However, what i have seen today is hopefully not some tradition i wasn't aware of.

It was a typical Friday, the sunshine was warm despite the fact that it was first few days of October, and the wind was chilling yet soothing, so me and my friends decided to meet up after school, as most of them haven't seen me for a couple weeks due to me visiting my gf from a different city. The first 3 of us met at the local park near a small lake. After walking around for about an hour we decided that we should head to the town center, as it was dark, so walking around there was a whole different vibe. Plus, we had to pickup a friend that took a bus from a nearby city. There was a bridge that we had to walk through, as it connected the edge of town to the park, and near it was an old mill made of bricks that is about a few hundred years old, and it looks as old and beaten down as it sounds. It wasn't abandoned or haunted (at least thats what i thought) though, there was electricity, the inside was authentic yet renovated to keep warmth, because recently cultural dance parties were started to be hosted there. I have been in few of them, with the same friends. And as we crossed the bridge on our way to our town, thats what we thought. Can you blame us? Lights were up, people were walking around, tons of cars parked near the mill footsteps of people dancing so loud, you could hear it outside. We thought it would be cool to check it out later. I should probably note that there were a few people outside smoking, looking as if they are anxious about something, however i quickly brushed it off, as we had to meet our other two friends. As we finally got our last mate (lets call him Will for privacy), we decided that it would be nice to hang out there. Thats where our biggest mistake happened.

As we made our way towards the mill, one of us noticed something was off. There were less cars parked, no people were staying outside, and there was this weird feeling of uneasiness, as if it was a trap of some sorts. As we got closer, one of us asked:
"Wait, maybe this place is rented for the night"?
I have lived in this town all my life, yet i have never heard about renting it. Even if it was true, who would want to celebrate their birthday or wedding in an almost-ancient mill? Either way, our curiosity got the better of us.

We silently opened the front door and sneaked in to not alert others if we were uninvited here. After opening the door the feeling of uneasiness has spiked indefinitely, as we could hear singing from above. A chorus of middle-aged women were singing some words we couldn't make out, yet wrapped in curiosity we decided we should check further. Ground floor - nothing. There wasn't much to do there, so we didnt make much of it. As we got to the first floor, shit started to hit the fan. The previously-mentioned women chorus was accompanied by a low, ambient sound. We saw a huge table full of sweets, snacks, sandwiches, tea - you name it. For some reason it only sparked that feeling of us not meant to come here. The previously-mentioned Will decided it was a good idea to walk a few steps up the stairs and peek at what they were doing. His words didnt seem to distressed, rather they were almost comical.
"Hey guys", -he whispered, -"i think that they are doing some sort of ritual". 
As probably the most curious of our bunch i thought it was a good idea to peek there as well. At first it didn't seem to be too alarming, just a couple (around 20 of them) of singing people stood there in a circle and sung songs.

It was then that i started noticing the weird stench that was coming out of the floor. At the same time, one of them moved their leg for some reason, and thats when i saw it - they weren't standing around a weird symbol, and the stench was either the blood they used to paint it on the floor, or the dead body of a man who was smoking earlier. His skin was pale and eyes black, half of his robes and hands were bloody. We whispered to each other for a minute how weird this is, yet after that we decided it would be a good idea to just go outside and chill somewhere else. However, thats when i realised our mistake.


The whole building started to shake, and the dead body started barely moving. Mere seconds later, it opened up, and a pale, White dressed lady started coming out of his stomach. Completely terrified we started running. Even as silent as we were while going down, for some reason i am sure they heard us. We might have broken that damn old door as we were escaping, but it didn't matter at the time. As we walked out, we saw Simon - a local music teacher who made these parties possible, sitting by one of the cars. He looked at us with a sad look in his eyes and asked:
"You saw what happened there, didnt you?"
Without us saying a thing, he mouthed:
"Run. They know about you...."
That was enough for us to not ask anymore questions. We ran, as quickly as we could, all in a small squad. After a couple of minutes running, we realised no one was chasing us, not anymore at least. We started to at least try to process what we saw there, but there was literally no possible explanation to a man being gutted and a woman, no, SOMETHING that looks like a woman, climbing out of him, all the while a group of cultists (or whoever they where) just standing there, watching. I live a bit further from town, so i asked my mom to come and pick us up, then drop off everyone in front of their home door. 

I feel kind of guilty for all this. For talking my friends into going there, for telling all that to my mom, knowing perfectly well that she probably cant sleep now either. I cant even comprehend what would have happened to either one of us if we were caught. Either way, unless i see a poster or something, im never coming back there...

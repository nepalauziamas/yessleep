There's an important angel diplomat in that vehicle, heading into the depths of Hell to meet with one of Hell's presidents to discuss a potential peace treaty. The angel is protected by 3 of the toughest loyal demon bodyguards. The angel is not defenseless. He carries million-unit holy water spray, a standard issue weapon for all angels on missions in Hell. There's a convoy of demon soldiers driving along planning to intercept the armored transport vehicle and take the angel hostage. However, as soon as the vehicle approached the armored transport it was blown to smithereens by the 50-cal machine gun. As a deterrent against violence, the armored transport vehicle is armed with Hell's equivalent of a nuclear weapon, a fission device with a holy water core.

Hell has nuclear weapons as well, so the angel does not plan on detonating that nuke unless his life is in imminent danger. The armored transport vehicle arrives at the capitol building of Hell, where there is an air-locked air-conditioned facility with water for angel diplomats. The people in Hell are not allowed anywhere near this place, one of the few places of reasonable comfort in Hell. And demons don't want to go in anyway. Demons with lava blasters stand outside the capitol building. They both protect the angel diplomats and keep the people in Hell away. The angel arrives safely and they have a congressional meeting to discuss the issues surrounding Heaven, Hell, and the Earth.

The meeting concludes as usual: debating, arguing, a few fights, but no resolution and no peace treaty. The angel is then escorted by his demon bodyguards back to the armored transport vehicle for his journey back to Heaven. Along the way he gets surrounded by a demon envoy who wants to take him hostage, throw him in the lava, and demand a huge ransom from God. The angel is surrounded and outnumbered, his weapon and the 3 demon bodyguards being no match for the attacking force. The angel has no choice other than to detonate his holy water nuclear weapon, obliterating a large section of Hell and creating a cool and comfortable haven where there's no fire and there's a bit of water in the middle of the Abyss.

Thousands of demons are obliterated on the spot. Millions of people in Hell flock to this oasis, their desire to be free of torments being no match for the demon army. A nuclear war has begun. Hell launches a retaliatory strike against one of the cities in Heaven, obliterating thousands of angels and creating a Hell in the middle of Heaven. Millions of victims in Heaven are in need of immediate medical attention from Jesus and His best archangels to fully heal their burns and get rid of their pain.

This was a terrible loss for Heaven, a loss of one of their greatest cities, which will not be habitable for at least several hundred years. Fortunately, the authorities of both Heaven and Hell have agreed to halt the exchange of nuclear weapons. A full-scale nuclear war was prevented, but a new Cold War between Heaven and Hell has begun.

I was sitting in my house playing on my computer when all of a sudden I heard a thud on the window. I look up and realized it was raining which was great because I love it when it's raining outside, and I'm gaming I don't know it just sounds great. 

I went back to gaming when all of a sudden I heard something outside I look up but see nothing. Likewise, I went back to gaming when all of a sudden I heard that sound again it sounds like someone is running outside, so I look again and saw nothing.

This was confusing I thought was it my imagination playing tricks on me, it had to be, or was there something out there. I, then got a message from my friend asking if I was also hearing things outside. I now knew I was hearing things outside "Yeah, I have been what do they sound like?" 

It took a while, then he replied, "Like something is running around outside" now I knew I was hearing footsteps, but what were they. People running to get inside or was an animal running around. But that didn't explain how we would hear the same thing at the same time, I needed answers, and I needed them now.

I kept looking out the window to see if I could catch whatever was making the sound. But nothing happened the rain continued and I saw nothing outside. My friend then sent a message "I saw it, the thing that was making that sound." I quickly replied, "What is it?" He was slowly replying to me and it felt like an hour for every second it took him.

He finally sent me the reply "....It's not human" what did he mean by that? Was it an animal or something like a dog? I then heard something outside it was a human scream it scared me so I bolted over to the window, and what I saw horrified me.

A man was laying on the ground with blood pouring from his next where there was a bite mark. Over him was a human, but all pale it had no clothes on. Showing how skinny it was with blood pouring from its mouth and it let out an animal-like roar. But that wasn't it when it stood up it was around 8 feet tall.

It picked the guy up and then proceeded to open its mouth up but when it did its mouth expanded out. He then put the whole guy's head in his mouth and as the guy screamed the creature bit down taking his whole head off. I wanted to puke after seeing that I then ran to my parent's room, and I tried telling them everything I saw.

"We don't like it when you lie to us" I was getting mad "I'm not lying I saw it outside my window" my dad got up and went to my room and I followed behind. When he looked out the window, he turned back and said, "There's nothing out there, I knew you were lying." I was confused and looked out the window and I didn't see the creature or body, at all out there.

My dad was about to leave when all of a sudden we heard a crash at the window and when we turned around I almost screamed. There the creation was looking at both of us both me and my dad had froze there until the creature roared and we ran out of there.

We went into my parent's room and locked the door and backed up from it, my mom was confused and said "What happened?" But we didn't say a word and she looked out the window, and she froze. I went over and there were 2 outside and they both roared at the same time until a cat jumped from a tree, and both of them chased after it far from our house.

I then got a call on my phone, and when I checked it and it was my friend. I answered and heard him panicking on the other side "One got in my house and killed my parents" I froze hearing this. I then heard a creature roar on the other side "Oh god it just found" I then heard him scream until it went silent. I called out his name until the phone disconnected.

My parents were looking at me with concerned faces but didn't say anything to me. My dad then got excited and said "I just remembered I have a gun in my hidden safe" he ran to the closet and opened the door and behind some clothes was safe. He put in the combination and opened it up, and there it was my dad's gun. He then grabbed the ammo and loaded the gun up and he then looked at us "I'm going out there to kill those fuckers." 

My mom tried to stop him from going out there but my dad just looked at her and said, "I made a promise to protect this family" he then looked at me and said, "Take care of your mother for me, promise me that son." I looked at him trying to hold back tears and replied "I promise" my dad then went outside and we heard him start firing the gun. My mom covered her ears as he did and it kept going until I didn't hear the gun anymore.

I didn't dare look out the window and just sat in the corner not making a sound and I don't know how long it was until I fell asleep. I eventually woke up and looked around and I saw my mom was asleep I also saw sunlight outside, seeing that it finally stopped raining, plus I didn't hear anything outside.

I peaked out the window and saw military trucks, I went over to the door, and when I opened it I saw a man standing there. He asked if my parents were home and I told him, my mom was. He sat down with both of us and told us that he would give us 50k if we signed a paper saying we wouldn't tell anyone what happened.

My mom agreed and signed but it took me a while to think about it, but eventually, I signed it. But by reading this you could tell I didn't listen to him at all. I don't care what they do to me those things killed my friend and father. Why would it even matter you probably don't believe me anyway, so I'm signing off now.

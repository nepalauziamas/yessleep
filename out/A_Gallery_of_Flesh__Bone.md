Case File #00493

&#x200B;

*The following has been transcribed from a series of audio recordings sent to the \[REDACTED\] Police Department. Also included are detailed descriptions of security footage sent along with the audio recordings.*

&#x200B;

*…*

&#x200B;

*On July 21st/2014, at 3:26 pm, security cameras captured Nicole Johnston arriving on the premises of \[REDACTED\]. She enters a makeshift waiting area with four other unidentified journalists. Nicole speaks with the other journalists and shakes their hands before sitting down. She digs through her purse and produces a recording device.*

&#x200B;

*The recording is as follows.*

…

*\[The device turns on.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** Okay, today is July 13th/2014. I'm here at \[REDACTED\], which seemingly has been turned into an art gallery- if you could call it that.

&#x200B;

I'll be recording my thoughts during this viewing for my notes. Hopefully, there won't be too much audio to go through. I was a little surprised to receive this invitation from *Adonis Cray*. I'm not a fan of sculptures, but he said in his letter that I'd love his most recent "*raw and edgy*" work. I do like to be at the forefront of new trends.

&#x200B;

Adonis Cray isn't a name I'm familiar with; he's done some stonework in the past, but nothing memorable. Like I said, I'm not really a fan of sculptures anyway. I'm going into this with an open mind. He was kind enough to give me a first loo,k, and I'd like to do his work justice.

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole starts a conversation with another journalist for a few minutes before a door is heard sliding open in the distance. A tall man with long dark hair enters the room on security footage. He is wearing a well-tailored black suit, shirt, and tie. The man walks towards the waiting area as everyone stands to greet him.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** *\[under her breath\]* Wow, I had no idea Adonis Cray was so handsome. Obviously, I'll leave that part out.

&#x200B;

*\[A few pleasantries are exchanged as the man in the suit makes his way through everyone before addressing them.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis**: I'd like to thank all of you for coming. I'm aware that this is entirely out of the way and, well, a little strange, to say the least. While it's true that this warehouse isn't the type of atmosphere I'd usually show off my work in, I felt it necessary to isolate myself. The hustle and bustle of the city got to be a little much for me. Plus, you all don't have to pay for parking!

&#x200B;

*\[The group shared a friendly chuckle.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** What I'm about to share with you all will be unlike anything you've seen before and will be the most incredible work you'll ever see again. I promise. I have three rooms full of work to show you before we end the tour with a look at what I’m working on next! I can’t stress this enough, my friends, no one living has seen this work yet!

&#x200B;

I look forward to getting your expert opinions on it. If you’d all follow me, please.

&#x200B;

*\[The journalists follow Adonis Cray through a large sliding door; after they all enter, the door is shut, blocking the view from the security camera in the waiting area. Another camera inside the first room captures the group making their way to the center of a large room; there are five statues in the room. Only a basic outline can be seen from the security camera. Nicole is seen approaching the first statue.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** These..statues..they're incredible. They’re so life-like! The proportions, the hair, it's perfect! How did you achieve this with wax?

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Thank you, Miss Johnston; I’m very moved by your kind words. The material I’m using is a little more complicated than simple “wax,” but we’ll get to that later.

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole is seen reaching out and running a hand across the arm of the first statue. She quickly recoils.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** That's..I...

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray approaches Nicole and the first statue.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Very life-like, isn’t it? It’s taken me years to perfect this method, I made many mistakes along the way, but I’ve finally achieved what I always dreamed of. I know it is a little macabre because they look and feel life-like. But I’m sure you would agree, Miss Johnston, that we must continue pushing the art world's envelope! Generic wax figures would not destroy any boundaries, but my work here? Well, I think you would agree that it is one of a kind.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** Yes, you could say that. The skin feels almost warm to the touch; how is that possible?

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Ah, now that part I must keep secret. Perhaps once I open my gallery, we could get together over a bottle of wine, and I’ll tell you all about it. In the format of an interview, of course.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** *\[Gently clears her throat\]* Uh, yes, that would be lovely, Mr. Cray. Thank you, I look forward to it.

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray walks past Nicole brushing her arm slightly as he continues to lead the tour.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** These were my first few sculptures using this method, they are good, but my work in the next two rooms is undoubtedly a cut above these. But please, take a moment to look around. We’ll move on whenever you’re ready.

&#x200B;

*\[The group disperses and walks from sculpture to sculpture. Nicole makes her way to each sculpture before stopping at the first one she sees again.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** The detail is incredible, the laugh lines on the face, bags under the eyes, and the..wow...I didn’t really notice the eyes until now. They look...I’m unsure how to describe it, almost as if they’re dead. The eyes have no natural color, and the iris is white. As I’m looking at it, I swear that-

&#x200B;

**Adonis**: Ah yes, the eyes. Please, let me explain. My glass eye supplier had a few B stocks in which the iris's colors ran, so the eyes were left plain. These are being used simply to cut costs. There will be more natural-looking eyes once the gallery opens. My apologies if they have unsettled you in any way; I know they can be..terrifying to look into.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** It’s alright, Mr. Cray; thank you for explaining. I’ll be sure to make a note of that in the article.

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Thank you, Miss Johnston. Now, if you’ve all had a look, let's move on!

&#x200B;

*\[The group moves into the next room; four statues are in each corner of the room. Before they fully enter the room, Adonis Cray stops to address the group.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I feel as if I should warn you all these statues are a little more..animated than the others were. On top of the fact that I have developed this new ultra-realistic material, I also have been working in automation with the help of a few experts. These statues are the first round of that collaboration. I don’t want to spoil the surprise of each one, but just a fair warning.

&#x200B;

*\[The journalists all exchange a look and quick chuckle before entering the room. Nicole approaches the first statue.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** The detail on this one is even more intense; it almost looks like theirs sweat on the warms of-

&#x200B;

*\[As Nicole approaches, the statue slowly turns its head to look directly at her. It then lifts its arm up and waves at her. Nicole takes a step back.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** Oh my god..it looks..so real. How is this even possible?

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** With the proper funding and people involved, Miss Johnston, anything is possible. Please, take a look at the others.

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole and the other journalists make their way to the second statue. This statue turns its head to look at them and slowly moves its arm up to remove a hat it is wearing in what appears to be a form of greeting. A couple of the journalists can be heard laughing on the audio recording. Still, no other notes are taken from Nicole. Making their way to the third statue, Nicole stops as the figure looks at her.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** This one, it’s a woman. It looks as if she's crying? Tears are falling down her cheeks. She's raising her arm with a handkerchief to dab at her tears. The realism is a little much for me on this one.

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I know this is just for notes, Miss Johnston, but please try to understand what I was going for with this one. This woman here is beautiful. Innocent, pure. However, she has been hurt by someone who used her, someone she trusted. That is why she has an endless flow of tears. It’s one of my favorite pieces, but I can understand if it's a little much.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** I can understand what you were going for; I think it’s the eyes I can’t get past. Maybe with more realistic-looking eyes, I’ll feel differently?

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Perhaps, although I think her eyes need to remain void of any actual life with this one. Any happiness, of any soul. She is heartbroken, after all.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** Right, there is no rule saying we can’t agree to disagree. Art is nothing if not subjective!

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole lets out a nervous chuckle before moving to the final statue in the room. Another journalist walks up to it as she approaches it, and the figure violently lunges forward. The journalist screams and falls to the ground. After a moment, the statue moves back to its original position. Another journalist helps him up.\]*

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray can be heard laughing in the background.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Oh my, I’m so sorry, my friend, but I had to let that happen! I needed to see if it would genuinely scare someone, I was worried it looked too mechanical, but after seeing it in action, my worries are a thing of the past!

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray continues laughing as he approaches the man who fell and dusts off his back.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I trust no one wants to see what statue again? I can’t say I blame you. As a sign of good faith, I’ll let you know now that this next room is a little more..sinister than this one. Maybe I watched too many bad horror films while working on them. But please try to keep an open mind!

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray leads the group through the door. Nicole stops and looks back at the statue that lunged forward.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** *\[Quietly to herself\]* Is that? It looks disgusting; it’s so dark. I guess it-

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole stops mid-sentence and looks around. At this point, she notices that all the statues have turned their heads towards her.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** Why..why are they looking at me..those eyes... I don’t like this...

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole quickly walks out of the room, joining the rest of the group. As she leaves the room, the heads of the four statues slowly turn back to face forward. Joining the group in the next room, the security camera shows four statutes. The room is darker than previous rooms.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Oh, I'm so sorry, my friends, it looks like I'm having some lighting issues. The damned janitorial staff was supposed to take care of this for me. Feel free to take a look around; just watch your step. I'll be back in a moment!

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray casually walks out of frame. The group of journalists spread out and walked toward the four statues. Nicole slowly approaches one on her own.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** I've been at a loss for words during this tour. What Mr. Cray is portraying with these statues I can't help but feel uneasy about. They certainly will not be for everyone; this particular one I'm looking at now might be the most disturbing. I can see a dark liquid pouring from its mouth; what the hell is it? As I walk towards it, it's looking at me; the mouth slowly opens. I don't know what-

*\[Suddenly, a loud scream erupts over Nicole's voice; the cry is dry and sounds as if whoever is causing it has damaged their vocal cords. Nicole shouts and can be seen on the security footage quickly backing away. As this happens, the other statues all begin to scream in unison. The volume of their cries together severely distorts the audio recording. All journalists, including Nicole, quickly run to the far side of the room, where they see a door. After trying to open it for several seconds, the door finally opens, and they run in. While this is going on, the statues continue to look at the group and scream. Once they exit the room, the screaming stops, and the figures return to their original stance.\]*

&#x200B;

*\[Security footage from the room the group runs into sees them slamming the door shut and looking around in a panic. The space is empty, aside from 5 empty pedestals in the center of the room.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** What the fuck were those?! We need to get out of here now!

&#x200B;

*\[All five of the journalists try to use their cellphones.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** No service?! Dammit, how the hell is that possible? Where is Adonis?! Let's see if there’s another door over there-

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I wouldn’t waste your energy.

&#x200B;

*\[On the security footage, Adonis Cray emerges from a dark corner and begins to walk towards the group. The group of journalists huddles together.*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** What the FUCK were those things?! Don’t tell us some bullshit about automation; tell us the truth. I saw the blood, the screams coming from those things. What the hell are you doing here?!

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I don’t see the point of keeping the truth from any of you; after all, I believe in honesty. Even to the media. My friends, what you have witnessed today is the next step in art. I grew tired of working with wood, stone, wax, glass, and paint. My desire to create was no longer fulfilled; I yearned for something more. When something inside me awoke, my passion brought out a voice in me that had been buried. A voice locked away in my family's blood for generations. This voice showed me the power I had flowing through my veins and how to hone it and use it to create works of absolute perfection. Human art.

&#x200B;

What you saw here today, I have decided to name *Flesh Statues.* They are the culmination of combining years of my craft and the power I now wield.

&#x200B;

Miss Johnston, the skin on the statues felt real because it is. The hair? Is real. The eyes? Well..you said it yourself. They look dead and void of any life because they are. This is what you have witnessed today; you are some of the first to look into the future of our world. The beautiful macabre of human art.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** You..took the dead's skin, hair, and eyes to create these?!

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray chuckles.\]*

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** No, Miss Johnston, nothing quite so crass. The *flesh statues* you saw today were all once people; they…provided their bodies for my gallery of flesh and bone. Of course, they may not have parted with their lives willingly, but with the power I now possess, they were helpless to stop me.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** You killed them..but how are they still moving? Still screaming?!

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I have learned how to reanimate the dead and bend their bodies to my will with my power. It is still a work in progress; they are unstable and can’t do much. But, moving their arms slightly or letting out the final sound they made before I tore the life force from their bodies?! That I can do.

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** You’re…a monster.

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Perhaps I am Miss Johnston; you can’t do the things I’ve done without having to take a good look inside yourself. Sometimes I stand and look in the mirror, questioning my choices and the monster some might say I have become. But, it’s all in pursuit of a greater goal. To build my powers by creating a gallery full of flesh statues, learn how to stabilize the reanimated dead for longer to do my bidding. Then, well, I suppose the sky is really the limit.

&#x200B;

*\[Adonis Cray laughs as he takes a step towards the group. The group of journalists all take a step back.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** You’re insane. This is just murder, you sick fuck. There’s no such thing as powers. Let us go; you can’t stop all of us.

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** Oh, I believe I can. I’ve never tried my powers on five people before, but an artist must challenge himself. If I’m to achieve my goals, I must grow stronger.

&#x200B;

*\[The security footage shows one of the journalists suddenly freezing in place as if held by an unseen force. Adonis Cray slowly approaches the man and places his hand on his chest. The other journalists run toward the door while screams are heard on the recording device of Nicole Johnston. As the voice of a man crying out in pain can be heard, followed by a loud gasp.\]*

&#x200B;

\[*Security footage shows the man Adonis Cray was attacking falling to the ground, lifeless. Cray then quickly turns his attention to the rest of the group. Nicole Johnston is sent across the room and into a wall with the flick of his hand. Cray then uses an unseen force to hold each journalist in place before placing his hand on their chest.\]*

&#x200B;

\[*This method renders each group member lifeless, their bodies hitting the floor with a loud thud. At the same time, screams fill the room as heard on Nicole Johnston’s recording device. After the final member of the four journalists falls to the ground, Adonis Cray takes a moment to fix himself, then turns his attention to Nicole Johnston.\]*

&#x200B;

**Nicole:** NO, STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM ME! SOMEONE HELP ME!

&#x200B;

**Adonis:** I saw you in a dream a few weeks ago. You were at the center of a room, holding a key. I wasn’t sure what it meant, but I think I know now. You are the final piece of this puzzle, the key to unlocking my full power. You will be my most remarkable work, Miss Johnston; you will be..*my masterpiece.*

&#x200B;

*\[Nicole begins screaming as Adonis Cray lifts her off the ground with an unseen force. In doing this, her purse falls to the ground with her recording device. The final image shown on the security footage is Adonis Cray opening a door with the flick of his wrist and entering it with Nicole levitating beside him. Nicole’s screams can be heard until the door closes.\]*

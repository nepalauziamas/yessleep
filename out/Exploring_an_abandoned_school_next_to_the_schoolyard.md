Me, and my two friends who we call Ben and Holly have recently explored the abandoned school next to the schoolyard in the early morning while waiting for school. They were separated by iron net-like fences which have been overgrown and worn a hole big enough for a teenager if not an adult to fit through.

We often joke that the horror movie will start when we go in and will run everywhere except for the exit whenever a killer clown spots us. Recently, we've explored it to see if there is something there, we thought we're gonna find small secrets, least likely to be a hideout for some children as if it was an imaginary secret base.

We clear out the tables and chairs, making it easier to walk through, we found some 100 and 200 cents ( 15000 cents will be equal to 1 USD Dollar), a torn-off book and a still working and very cool-looking pen, and some shriveled and cut origamis, suggesting arts and craft, nothing out of ordinary except for the last one, a chest at the most edge.

It looks like a treasure chest. The chest has four different locks. We are excited about this discovery but also worried a bit considering there's a shadowy figure drawing with the only clear part being his very large eyes, little thin arms with only 4 fingers with a gap in the middle, and legs getting thinner the further down and no feet.

But the school bell suddenly rang, we ran to the original hole in the net but it was blocked by stacks of tables that are a lot more than the ones we clear out and we teenagers are too weak to push it out of the way. And our handphones were in the class, and even if we brought them, the schoolyard had very slow internet. So we have Ben and Holly to clear the tables out, and me to open the chest.

I thankfully have a paperclip to open the first lock, I also find a toolbox with a hammer that I use to smash the second and third, and the fourth one is already broken. The chest is unlocked, but before I open it, there's a smell of rotten flesh and poop.

The chest reveals a human skeleton, most likely the drawing next to the chest. The eyes are actually glasses with the pupils being actual eyes, both feet look cut, and the arm? the middle fingers were cut. It looks like a murder scene, where the victim is stripped out of their clothes because only their skeleton, hair, and glasses are found and were put in the chest, locked by four separate locks to die and rot.

I called Ben and Holly to check whether I'm crazy or not, but right before I did, the skeleton disappear and a strong earthquake occurred. Thankfully Ben and Holly were done clearing the tables out, we got out and others soon come to avoid debris. Fortunately, the school was not down. Unfortunately, the abandoned school along with the chest room collapsed into rubble. We were asked to take our stuff and go home.

While home, Ben and Holly ask what did I see, I explained everything and their face is expressing worry. I don't usually make jokes, even if I did, I do it in a jokey manner. And considering how serious the situation is, who would joke about it?

We tried to think of a rational explanation. The trick of the light with anxiety, but there's a little bit of sunlight surrounding it, little but clear to see; A Halloween prank being left there, but Halloween wasn't really popular in our homeland; Carbon Monoxide hallucinations are the most likely, but the school has holes so it would've been leaked out, and we don't know if it can cause smell hallucinations.

For now though we can't do anything, since no one will believe us without concrete evidence, we can move the rubble out of the way but we're likely gonna get in trouble for it. The stuff we got don't prove anything as they were unrelated to the chest. The body mysteriously disappeared so it wouldn't matter if someone trust us.

So we share the experience on the internet, leave the body gone forever and let the person rest, and continued our life.

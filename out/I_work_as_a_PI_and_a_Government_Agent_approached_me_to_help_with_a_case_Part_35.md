“How do we beat them?” I asked, my hands sweating against the grip of my gun and not because of the heat. 

“I am uncertain. From that I read they need to be sent back to a nothing world. Their body cannot be cut by anything, and their pincers can, well, pierce anything. Why anyone would summon something like this is a mystery. Unless they confused their names with something else. That happens often. Summoning is relatively easy, but summoning the correct creature is the hard part.” 

If I came across the person who did this, I was going to kick their ass. They better have been trying to summon a less dangerous creature instead of putting the world in danger. But I didn’t know what was worse: Someone doing this on purpose or these two bugs getting into our world by accident.  

“So far, they haven’t come after us. Should we wait here for backup?” I asked. 

Nick shook his head. 

“No. They may be able to eat down to the core before help arrives. I’ll need to go out and distract them. The less time they spend eating, the better. If I get into a tight spot, can I trust you to fire these bullets into them so we both can get away?” 

Nick pulled out three bullets from his pocket. They appeared normal but I knew these were special. He once accidently made a bullet as strong as a bomb for a different case. Since then he hadn’t trusted me with something so powerful, and with good reason. If I fired them without cover, I might get caught up in the blast. I would need to keep my distance to use these. I nodded and quickly loaded them in the magazine, ready to go. 

We left through the back door. Dust was being kicked up in the distance from where the centipedes dug into the ground. I couldn’t keep up with Nick, so he needed to run while giving me a piggyback ride. It was embarrassing but necessary. His speed felt faster than it ever had before. I couldn't keep my eyes open from the wind and sand kicking up as he ran. In under a minute he had gotten close enough to the creatures. He set me down and took off again, ready to fight a hopeless battle. 

My gun at the ready and sweat dripping down my chin, I watched him closely. It was two against one and they were so big I really though my partner was in danger. The centipedes raised their heads, noticing something coming closer. Their pincers clicked as he got closer. I nearly raised my gun and fired when one dove towards Nick. 

He jumped right onto the monster’s head to run along its wide body. My chest hurt from fear and concern over him as the other raced down, mouth open. He jumped as the other creature crashed into the first, getting their bodies tangled. For a second, I lost track of Nick only to watch him come through the dust to land perfectly on the rough ground. A large tail came down as the creatures tried to get away from each other. Not only did he manage to dodge it, but he didn’t skid to a stop when he landed. 

Something felt off about all this. Nickie was moving too well. I was glad for that, but confused. Every time I’ve seen him try and stop from moving so fast, he always skidded a bit of a distance afterwards. Now he was stopping on a dime and able to swiftly turn heel to run if needed. With those new higher heels on his shoes, he should be twisting an ankle. In the middle of watching him risk his life, a thought came to mind. Was he moving better because he was wearing different shoes? Ones with heels? Did somehow the heels make it easier for him to move around? I shook my head trying to focus. Those questions needed to be answered later. 

Nickie was doing a pretty impressive job keeping those two monsters distracted for a while. He finally landed wrong, getting his pant leg caught in a small hole. Sharp rocks snagged the fabric. He was still able to jump out of the way, tearing off a part of his pants at the knee. Blood ran down his leg from where he’d been cut. He only glanced down for a second to see how bad the cut was, but it had already started to heal up as he moved out of the way of the leg of a centipede trying to pin him down. For some reason, he did a double take at his leg. An odd expression came over his face, and he was distracted long enough to get caught by the side of a pincer. I shot too late. His body was tossed aside, bouncing off the ground painfully. My bullet landed on the side of one of the centipedes and between the joints of the creature. I swore I heard it let out a cry of pain as the bullet exploded, the shockwave kicking up sand into my eyes. Coughing, I took off trying to find where Nick had landed. Sensing weakness, the uninjured creature started to attack the other one, trying to eat its partner. 

I ran, only focused on finding Nick. His black suit stood out on the bright sand. I nearly tripped trying to stop beside him. One of his arms was twisted and clearly broken. From how he was breathing, I would bet that hit also broke some ribs. His pant leg was already well on its way to trying to repair itself. Hooking him under the arms, I dragged him behind a rock and prayed it would keep us safe as Nick recovered.  

I forgot how heavy Nick was every time I needed to drag him somewhere. His wheezing breathing was not getting much better. Keeping him on his back, I kept watch, waiting for those creatures to notice us or for someone to come and help out. 

A few minutes passed and Nick appeared to be healing. 

“Skyler...?” He said hoarsely, not opening his eyes yet. 

“Nickie! What happened?! You were doing so well!” I quickly got to his side to take his good hand. 

I was worried not only about his injuries, but about why he suddenly stopped dodging in the middle of a fight. What was so wrong that distracted him so much? His eyes opened and I’ve never seen him so distraught before. The sounds of the monsters fighting faded as I my stress levels spiked. Staring up at the bright sky with such a defeated look on his face, he spoke in a low voice I needed to lean in to hear. 

“They’re not black.” 

I had no idea what he was going on about. Just before he was hit, he was looking at his leg. His self-repairing suit hadn’t fully fixed itself yet. Looking down, I spotted part of his bare leg and the kind of socks he was wearing. For a moment I was distracted by some tattoos running down his leg in such a light ink I almost missed them. The tattoos were a mess of circles and ancient writing showing they were connected to him and made through alchemy. The interconnecting circles were hidden by a high sock with cute lion heads decorating the top of them. At this point I knew Nick liked animals. Him having cute socks wasn’t really a surprise. Aside from the cartoon lions, the rest of the sock was black. Surely, he wasn’t talking about those, right? Looking back at his face I opened my mouth to question him only to not find the words. 

“I'm a failure of an agent.” Nick said, still staring upwards. 

I wanted to slam my face into the ground. He nearly died because he grabbed the wrong socks that morning?! I suppressed a scream of utter frustration. What was The Corporation doing to my poor partner to traumatize him like this? I wanted to shake him by the shoulders, but broken ribs would probably crack even more if I did so.  

“Nickie...” I said in the sweetest tone I could muster. “They’re just socks. If anyone gives you a hard time about it, I’ll punch their faces in. I think you’ve earned the right to wear what you want. Now we need to deal with a more important problem.” 

The pair of centipedes were now eating everything around them again at a frightening speed. Nickie was right. If we left them alone for too long, they would eat through the planet in no time at all. They had already devoured enough to create a crater around them. They needed to be stopped. My bullets weren’t going to be much help. Nick finally sat up, his face returning to normal. His chest was still injured and his arm was still in pain, but he could work through it. 

“A pincer is cracked.” Nick pointed out as we both watched the creatures dig around. 

He was right. Near the base, one of the pinchers had a crack running through it. With one good hit, it might be able to get blown off. An idea was forming in my mind. One of the things about magic was the issue with wording. On our first case Nick couldn’t find the trail that led unto the Witcher's territory. He needed to follow a human like myself to be able to enter it. There were scratches along each of the creature’s bodies, slowly healing up. For something that couldn’t be cut by anything, how did they get hurt? 

“I have an idea.” I said to Nick wondering if the weakness with wording applied to these creatures as well. 

He listened, unsure if my plan would pan out. If it didn’t, we would still be waiting on back up. At least this gave us a shot at killing one of these monsters. We weren’t certain if Nick was strong enough to pull this off. At least we were trying something. Without any more time to waste, he stood up, ready to try it. 

We both moved from the spot, and closer to the insects eating away at the desert around us. One of them raised its head, staring at the small bits of food coming their way. Nick kept going on ahead as I raised my gun again. The centipede dove down, racing on all of its legs towards Nick. I held my breath, steadied my hand and waited for the right time. Aiming towards the middle of the pincer, I fired. The crack already running through it caused the entire thing to be weak enough to be blown off by the extra-powerful bullet. Nick ran though the shockwave to grab ahold of a large part of the broken pincer while the centipede was still reeling from the hit. 

The other one came down and I ran forwards to shoot it. The blast blew it back, causing it to topple on its back. The one with the broken pincer stood up, ready to come down on Nick. Holding the oversized pincer, he dodged just in time. Using all his strength, he shoved the sharp piece of the creature into the side of its head. It let out a cry of pain as Nick used all his remaining strength to slam against the pincer piece, digging it deeper and deeper into the monster.  

I shouted a warning just as the second one was recovering. Rolling on its side, the massive creature started towards Nick. He quickly picked up another broken piece that was about half his height. Standing his ground, he let the other centipede ram into the pointed edge, forehead first. They both were dragged across the rocky ground as the huge body was carried by the momentum.  

I was left panting and with sweat dripping off my face, just staring at both motionless creatures. I never expected us to be able to kill one, let alone both of the centipedes. Thinking around the wording worked. Their bodies couldn’t be cut, but they could be pierced. And the pincers could pierce anything. They had the weapons needed to kill them on their own heads the entire time. Still in shock and disbelief, I started to walk over to Nick, ready to fight if one of them happened to move. 

He was exhausted, his chest still obviously hurting, and his hands were torn up from holding the rough pieces.  

“Are they dead?” I asked slowly. 

As if to answer my question, the centipedes' bodies started to show cracks. We tried to get away but weren’t able to do so fast enough. Both bodies cracked open, thick purple blood exploding everywhere. We got completely covered in the stuff. I coughed, trying not to puke from the smell. We saved the world and the cost was almost too great. While trying to get the disgusting stuff from my face, a crowd of agents came running through the desert towards us. The backup had finally showed up. From the looks of things, they brought along some heavy-duty weapons and agents. 

Even Ancaer was in the group of who I assumed to be agents specializing in summoning or magic. They wore robes instead of suits. Each looked more like they should be a part of a fantasy novel than a government agency. Every one of them with shocked expressions on their faces. No one believed we killed the threat before they arrived. We admitted we weren’t certain if any of the smaller bugs survived so they went off to see if there were any creatures still alive that needed to be taken care of. 

Nick and I stood as Ancaer made his way over. His arms crossed; I sensed Nick get stressed. If his boss found out about his socks, he might get in trouble. I almost expected the grumpy man to compliment us over a job well done. 

“That is going to stain.” Ancaer commented and left. 

We saved the world. Would it kill him to be nice about it? We were sent home to get cleaned up. I didn’t want to track the purple gunk into my apartment so Nick offered to let me go over to his place. He had enough rooms for us both to get cleaned up at the same time. To my horror, Ancaer was right. The purple did stain. 

No matter how much I scrubbed, the color wouldn’t fade from my hair. It dyed my normally dark brown hair almost black with a violet sheen to it. Some spare clothing that was a bit too big for me was set out. I wondered how bad Nick looked with the purple and the answer came soon enough as he knocked on the bathroom door where I was looking for a hair dryer. I opened it to see his normally pale hair now a pastel purple. 

It was very hard not to laugh in his face. He helped me find a hair dryer that was hidden under the sink after digging out a package of other new grooming items. He'd placed new razors, soaps, and all sorts of items for any guests that may come by inside it. What we were looking for was behind an electric razor meant for styling hair. It was a brand I knew pretty well and was pretty excited over it.  

As Nick dried his hair, he watched as I was fawning over the razor set.  

“When I was with my parents, they tried getting me into more girlie hobbies. Cutting hair was one of them. It was the only thing that stuck. I did it on the side and styled all my friend's hair in school. Even charged some money for it. Soon nearly the entire school was paying me to do it. I swear, that paid for a year’s worth of my nephew's diapers.”  

Back then, money was tight. I did almost anything I could to earn a few bucks. Mowing lawns, collecting cans, snow shoveling, you name it. The hair cutting brought in a decent amount because I was good at it. And it saved money because myself and my sister never needed to pay someone to do our hair. 

Nick’s hair was getting pretty long and choppy in places. He never bothered to take better care of it. I was harassing him to at least even it out, or cut off the dead ends for a while. I turned on the razor and looked over at him with a devilish gleam in my eyes. 

“I can style your hair if you want.” 

He looked from me to the buzzing razor, his face a little pale. 

“It’s fine. I doubt any styling would suit me.” 

Taking one step closer, I kept a smile on my face, trying to sound convincing. 

“You would look cute with an undercut. It wouldn’t even take very long let me just-” 

To try and get his smaller partner back under control, he turned on the hair dryer and blew hot air directly into my face. He may be armed with a hair dyer, but I was an expert at talking people into haircuts. I could sense it when they wanted one but their self-confidence was too low to think they could pull off a certain style. At first, they might freak out a little. In the end they always felt proud of how much of a difference just cutting their hair made. 

In the next ten minutes I’d talked him into to just looking up what different styles looked like on my phone. That was when I knew I had him already convinced. If they were looking, they were already considering the haircut. Nick was such a pushover; it only took another five minutes to have him sitting down in front of the bathroom mirror with a towel over his shoulders to catch the loose strands.  

I was totally right in that he looked damn cute with only half of his head shaved. I kept it a bit longer than just shaving it close to his skull. It was a big change but he deserved to look nice once in a while. He fiddled with his hair in front of the mirror and I cleaned up the mess on the bathroom floor. Tossing the left-over hair in the trash, he looked over. 

“You’re just throwing it out?” He asked, a bit confused. 

At first, I didn’t know what he meant. Then I realized this must be the first time anyone just tossed away his hair instead of treating it like a sample to be used. After all, I’d wanted to fix his hair before The Corporation messed it up by chopping off pieces at random to study.  

“Should I have kept it?” I asked unsure. 

Shaking his head, Nick smiled. It hurt my chest every time he did let a smile slip. It was a rare expression. His smiles almost always happened for a heartbreaking reason. He finally found someone who wanted to cut his hair just for the fun of it and not to use him. I needed to think of something else. 

“You know, you don’t look like this uptight agent when you smile. Or with the purple hair.” I commented. 

I was glad he looked like a normal person for once. His expression fell into a slightly panicked one. His eyes darting from between the mirror and myself he knew it was the truth. He didn’t look like an agent. His hair needed to grow back before he did. With the pinkish color before, he was pushing the official government look. Now there was no way anyone was going to take him seriously. I knew the look on his face. I've seen it pretty often. It was from all the students who went behind their parents backs to get their hair styled. Regret always came, thinking they would be grounded forever. 

Nick was having a silent freak out. I’d talked him into this so I needed to calm him down. Nothing was going to happen to him. No, he wasn’t going to be fired. It was just a haircut. If any of his bosses got mad, they could give him some vacation days until it grew back out. He had earned some, after all. It took an hour for me to feel as if Nick was fine enough to be on his own for the night. We both needed some rest after saving the world. 

I didn’t regret talking him into the hairstyle. He needed to like his appearance for a short while. Apparently, his hair grew fast and would be back to normal in about two weeks. Nothing to worry about. I could sleep easy knowing my partner was standing up for himself more. Not only was he now adopting the pets he wanted, he could also wear mostly black socks while knowing someone had his back. I went home to sleep that night, unaware of what kind of issue a simple hair cut would cause. 

I was only asleep for a few hours when someone came into my room. Startled, I sat up, ready to fight off whoever had broken into my place. I was still half asleep as a man wearing a suit grabbed my arm. I was pulled out of bed, my door opened and pushed into a long hallway. 

“I'm sorry but Ancaer sent me to get you. No time to get dressed.” The agent said as he kept us moving. 

My brain slowly started to work. I was being dragged down The Corporation hallway towards Ancaer’s office in the middle of the night. For what? The agent was nervous, face creased in stress. He didn’t even bring me right to the office door. He pushed me forwards and darted behind a fake potted plant as if it could protect him.  

“A lot of us will miss you if you die, so be careful.” He commented in a small voice. 

What was he talking about? There couldn't be anything I’d done recently to piss off a certain grumpy boss this much. I was a bit upset at being woken up so rudely that I didn’t even think of the obvious as I opened the door to go inside.  

Ancaer was waiting, arms crossed, sitting in a chair across from a couch in the middle of the room. I walked over, fuming from getting dragged out of bed for this. Nick sat, his sword across his lap, eyes down, unable to look at anything but the floor. 

“Did you do this?” The large man growled, gesturing a clawed hand over towards my partner. 

That was what this was all about? I could strangle him. My anger was getting the better of me. I stood next to the couch refusing to sit down, still in the baggy clothing Nick had lent me. 

“I was sleeping! This couldn’t wait until morning?” I hissed. 

Ancaer shot up, Nick stayed sitting but he raised his hands as if that would help.  

“Do you have any idea what you did? Do you have any brains in your head?! Nicolas is useless until this is fixed! We cannot put him in front of the public for any jobs!” Ancaer’s voice shook the table in front of him.  

I should have backed down, but I only got more pissed. Nick would just have to do different jobs, or take a break. I knew that there was a huge backlog of cases, but damn it! My partner had gone through enough and earned the right to feel good about himself.  

“Then give him time off! You’re acting as if this is the end of the world! It's just a haircut for Christ's sake! You shouldn’t even be able to control something like this. You’re his boss, not his father!“ 

 There was no way I could have known talking back would be such an issue. I knew Ancaer would be angry, but not violent. Once the words were out of my mouth, he picked up the chair next to him and tossed it at my head. It missed by mere millimeters. The wood exploded against the wall, denting it. I was unable to move as his face changed into something closer to an animal. His teeth became so large they couldn't fit in his mouth, and his eyes were glowing.  

“I’ll kill you if you speak like that again!” Ancaer roared so loud everything in his office shook. 

Something happened that I also never would have thought possible. Nick moved so fast neither of us could react. With one foot on the table, he slammed the other onto Ancaer’s chest forcing him back into the chair. His one hand on his scabbard, and the other on the hilt of the blade, exposing an inch. He was looking down at the larger man, his back facing me.  

“I’ll never forgive you if you harm my partner.” 

His voice was low. It chilled the air and made the entire room heavy. I never knew Nick would draw his sword against his boss if my life was threatened. That was something he could be fired for. And if The Corporation no longer needed him, they may decide to use his entire body for experiments. Nick was risking his life in that moment. Slowly, Ancaer started to shift back to a more human face. Not calm, but not as angry as before.  

“How disgusting. Your partner has no strength of his own. Humans are weak. Always relying on others.” 

Neither of them moved. Ancaer appeared as disgusted as he sounded. My hands trembled, unsure of what kind of outcome might happen if I spoke up. I needed to reply, but not to disagree with the statement. 

“I do rely on others. I trust them and they trust me. We offer each other help freely because we care about each other. That’s a human’s strength. They’re able to accept help if needed. If you did go through with hurting me, Nick wouldn’t be the only one upset and after your head. I've found a lot of people I care about in the past few months who would turn on you. You might be able to tear down this entire building, but if something happened to you, would anyone care?” 

We all fell silent for a while. The truth of those words was sinking in. Everyone was afraid of Ancaer. He didn’t have a single person to back him up. His own employee was staring him down, with a hand on his sword and ready to protect his partner instead of siding with his boss.  

“It appears you have me cornered. If your strength in numbers trumps my own, what are you going to do with it? Get your little friends to kill me and discard of a problem?” He growled and Nick stiffened a little. 

“No. Nothing. Just do your job and we won’t have any issues. I don’t care enough about you to have my friends risk getting hurt fighting an angry old man. Just stop giving Nick a hard time and we’ll be fine.” 

It was just a haircut I repeated in my head. How did it tun out like this again? Ancaer gave us both a hard look. He moved, one hand grabbing Nick by the back of his shirt to put him back down on the ground. I figured he could have won in a fight if Nick did attack him. If they got into it, one of them would have died. It was crazy thinking about what nearly happened because of such a simple thing. 

“Get out of my office boys. Do not speak a word of this to anyone or else I shall punish you.” 

A pair of rough hands were placed on both of our backs to be shoved very rudely from the office. The door slammed behind us so hard, it cracked the wooden frame it was in. We stood in the hallway, shocked, just waiting in case Ancaer changed his mind and came out really upset at us. Somehow, we had lived through the encounter and emerged without a scratch.  

“Do you think he knows he called us both boys?” I pointed out, not knowing what else to say. 

Nick didn’t answer. His legs rigidly straight, he moved awkwardly over to the potted plant only to bend over and puke into it. I rushed over to see how he was doing. Threatening Ancaer stressed him out way more than I thought. Without much in his stomach, he was just throwing up bile. I sat with him, hand on his back, regretting how he was feeling. 

“Your hair looks great by the way.” I mentioned. 

His mouth was pressed against the back of his hand. The sound he made was either him throwing up in his mouth, or a snort of a laugh. Saving the world was easy compared with trying to deal with a raging boss. I wasn’t going to sleep that night, that much was for certain. I would rather fight giant centipedes every day than deal with Ancaer again. From how Nickie looked, he might agree with that idea.

I have a long tailed grass lizard name Stripey (Male, 2) and he is the sweetest little boy ever, I have many pets but he is my closest friend, he watches movies with me, I knit and 3d print him little toys, he never bites, he is even certified as an emotional support animal, he would never hurt me, the only times he was aggressive is during feeding. He lives in a 280 liter tank with a bioactive set up, he is living his best life he can, vet procured food, the whole 9 yards.

but recently he has not been eating, he is usually very hungry, and he is more aggressive, I took him to a vet, over an hour away, and he ran out of the office, took us hours to find him, he was underneath a cross at the vet, Im in a extremely christian country, his eyes had a red hue.

On the ride home I turned on some kendrick Lamar, and Sing About Me, Im Dying Of Thirst was playing. Stripey was on my shoulder then he jumped onto my face, I swerved and hit a tree, almost flying off a cliff, next time I saw the local scholar of christianity, I asked him about it, because both events where related to christianity, he said it couldn't be a demon because of it contact with cross was not harmful to him,

He kept acting aggressive every time I tried to hold him, he kept biting my ring finger, which has a ring with a religious symbol on it of my religion(I do not want to share), then I realized he would be defensive to any religious symbol

Then the hissing started, every second he lets out a little hiss and sometimes it sounds like words, I got one of those translator apps, and every language I tried said "wrong language" so it thought that was the default for when it doesn't pick up a language, then I tried Latin and it said, "surprisingly no" and I realized that it was picking up stuff the entire time, then I tried cantonese, where they are from, and it said, "I am son of rosemary, brother of Damien, I am god of the monsters"

This sent chills down my spine, I has watched the Omen and Rosemary's baby with him.

I looked at him horrified, he jumped at the glass and it shattered, the glass hit my body and send blood everywhere, I began to scream but I couldn't speak, there was glass in my throat he began to tail whip me, then he began to fly and levitate,

I got to a hospital and got help, then went home to try to find him, I still love him, I set up a 208 liter terrarium for him he is beginning to eat again but his tail is growing longer and he always flys, at this point I give up, he is my baby, I would die for him,  he is calming down but sometimes will see figures, or fires, or broken glass just some where in the house, and he constantly escapes,

what should I do?

"What are you, 200, 250 years old?” I would joke, patting my grandfather lightly on the back. He always laughed at that one. Scrunching up his face as he smiled, leaving temporary wrinkles scattered amongst permanent ones.

In reality, he was only 85 years old when he died. In his sleep, they said. What a blessing, they said, but it didn’t feel like a blessing to me. Sure, there are worse ways to go. I suppose I should be grateful that he didn’t suffer. But I certainly did. He may have lived for 85 years but I only got to know him for 26. Well, only 21 really, if I’m counting from the first moment I can actually remember with any clarity.

I was sitting on his lap in the red velvet wingback chair beside the fireplace. He loved that chair and planted himself in it every evening after supper. Even after he passed I could recognize the impression of his legs on the fabric-covered cushion. He was showing me some fragile-looking, slightly yellowed, black and white photographs inside a dusty old album. I don’t remember why. Family photos, maybe. Then suddenly he grabbed the receiver of his defective 1920s-era telephone, the kind with a separate mouthpiece connected to the candlestick-looking base by a wire, and pretended to answer a call.

“Hello,” he chimed. “I'm sorry but you’ll have to call back later. I am spending quality time with my granddaughter.” He gently snapped the mouthpiece back into place, ending his imaginary phone call, and nodded at me with a stern expression on his face as if to say that the person on the other end of the line should have known better than to interrupt our play date. I laughed, and laughed, and laughed the way only a child could laugh at such a silly joke.

“You’ll take care of my things when I’m gone, will you?” he had asked me once, years later, gesturing broadly to the ancient oddities and knick-knacks that decorated his modest home. “Of course,” I confirmed. He nodded, satisfied with my brief response. That was the closest he ever came to writing a will, not that he needed one. None of his collectibles were truly valuable to anyone except him. And to me, for purely sentimental reasons. In truth, most of his belongings were derelict, dysfunctional, or decaying. Like that old telephone.

The telephone occupied a place of honor in the sitting room, adorning the mahogany end table beside his beloved chair despite the fact that the only purpose it served was ornamental. If he truly wanted to make a phone call he had to wrench himself to his feet and hobble all the way across the living room and into the kitchen where he had a modern— well, more modern than the 20s— telephone mounted to the wall. The plastic kind with a long curly cord. This was no easy task in his later years when he relied heavily on a walker for mobility. I begged him to replace the broken antique with something more functional but he adamantly refused.

“I am expecting a phone call” he would argue as if the damn thing actually worked. I couldn’t do a thing but roll my eyes and chuckle at the familiar joke. He had always been stubborn so it really wasn’t worth debating anyway.

In lieu of a traditional funeral, we held an informal memorial service in his home three days after he died. Aunts, cousins, friends, and neighbors all gathered in the sitting room, ambling about with tears in their eyes, occasionally chucking at a shared memory. It was a lovely service. When everyone was gathered together, it almost felt as if he was still there with us. I half expected to see him occupying his usual place in the wingback chair, smiling at all the attention given to him by his guests. It wasn’t until the service had ended, and the last family members had said their goodbyes that I truly felt the weight of his absence for the first time. I had offered to stay behind and clean up the stray cups and plates littered between Victorian-era trinkets in the sitting room.

Moving from corner to corner of the vacant room, shoveling trash into a large plastic bag, I struggled to keep myself from crying. I don’t know why I felt so determined to resist the tempting sensation but, for some reason, I couldn’t bear the thought of tainting this room with sadness. This room where my grandfather and I had laughed, and played, and danced, and read, and flipped through photo albums, content to enjoy every moment that we shared together. For a moment, I thought I could even see the memories play out before me— shadows danced in my periphery, casting a familiar warmth over the cold, empty room. Tears welled in my eyes as I surrendered to the anguish rippling through my stomach. Waves of despair crashed against my rib cage, threatening to break through from the inside. My heart sunk in my chest, burying itself deep, deep, deep inside the human-shaped void that had formed in want of my grandfather.

Just as I was beginning to feel completely overwhelmed by the sudden rush of sorrow coursing through my veins, I was interrupted by a sound that I had never heard before.

"Bbbrrrriiiiiinnnnnngggggg," rang the broken telephone, sending an electric shock through my body. My head snapped toward the phone, wide-eyed. The ringing sliced through the air as I stared in awe at the suddenly working device on the mahogany table. I massaged the semi-dried tears off my face and slapped my damp hand on the telephone receiver, afraid that a delay in reaction would end the call before I'd had a chance to answer it.

"Hello?" I squeaked into the shiny, black mouthpiece in the palm of my hand.

"Eliza?" came a male voice, sounding slightly surprised. "So I finally get to speak to the famous granddaughter! How lovely. Is your grandfather home?"

My face echoed his own surprise, although he couldn't see it. Tears welled in my eyes, once again, as I struggled to find the words to tell this man that my grandfather wasn't simply absent from his home, but from this world entirely.

"Um.. no, I'm so sorry... he is. He is... uh, who is this?" was the best I could come up with in the moment.

"This is Louis Hartzog. Could you tell him I called?" he queried.

"Louis..." I repeated in a whisper. "No, I can't... I'm so sorry. He passed away. Three days ago. I'm sorry."

"Ah..." he paused, a crackling silence occupying the space between our respective receivers. "I was afraid of that. He hasn't been answering my calls, you see. For the last few days...." His voice was quiet. I thought I could hear him sniffling.

"Well," he continued, clearly struggling to keep his voice from shaking. "I'll talk to you tomorrow."

With that, the line went dead. I stood for a moment, receiver to my ear, handheld mouthpiece primed for a much longer conversation. Louis? I don't recall ever hearing that name. Not that my brain was working properly at the moment, anyway. I suppose, in my grief, I may have forgotten to inform a few friends of the family. But someone who knew me by name? I placed the telephone back on the end table, gently, as if sudden contact with the mahogany surface might cause the base to shatter. It was then that I remembered the condition of the telephone and the impossibility of the conversation I'd just had. This telephone was well and truly nonfunctional. It had *always* been nonfunctional. Or so I thought, anyway. I picked it up again, rotating it in my hands. A chill ran up my spine as I noticed that there was no wire protruding from the base of the receiver. An empty hole remained where the inner mechanism had once resided.

I dropped the telephone back on the table as though it were burning the palm of my hand and ran into the kitchen, throwing myself at the modern phone attached to the wall. My heart was racing in my chest. A steady ache was forming in my head. My shaking fingers struggled to push the white, plastic buttons as I desperately attempted to dial my mothers' phone number.

"Hello?" she answered. I could tell that she had been crying. Her fathers death had been hard on her. It was hard for all of us.

"Who is Louis Hartzog?" I screeched into the phone, ignoring her fragile emotional state.

"Louis? He's... Eliza, are you still at my dads' house? Are you okay?" she asked, sadness making room for concern.

"Fine!" I said, a little too loudly to be believable. I knew she could tell I was panicking. "I'm fine" I repeated, in a forced, monotone cadence that may have actually fooled someone who wasn't my mother.

“Okay...” she said, clearly unconvinced. “Why are you asking about Louis?”

“Is he a friend of grandpa?” I prodded, answering her question with my own.

She sighed. “Was. He died in the early 60s. A car accident, I think. Do you need me to come get you?”

*Died. He died in the early 60s*. The words sent my stomach lurching. My already aching head began to spin. Ice formed in my veins as I stood frozen, holding the plastic phone against my ear.

“Elizabeth?” came my mother’s increasingly concerned voice, bringing me back to Earth.

“Mom! I’m fine. Thank you.” I snapped before placing the phone back into the mount on the wall without saying goodbye. I knew she was worried but, at that moment, I had worries of my own to contend with.

Unsticking my frozen feet from the tile floor, I stumbled back into the sitting room, tripping over the half-filled bag of trash I had dropped on the carpet near the entryway. Regaining my balance, I continued onward through the room, half expecting to be surprised at another intrusion by Louis. But the room remained empty and silent except for my ragged breathing. I collapsed onto the ancient floral couch at the back of the room and hugged an embroidered pillow to my chest, desperate for some sort of comfort.

I must have fallen asleep at some point because I awoke suddenly the next morning to a ray of sunshine stabbing me in the eye. I was briefly confused about my surroundings before I recalled the events of the previous night. *He died in the early 60s...* My mothers' words echoed in my ears causing my stomach to churn. I threw my hand over my mouth to keep from vomiting on the floral upholstery as I yanked myself up and ran towards the bathroom. I thrust my head into the toilet, emptying the entire contents of my stomach into the waiting water below.  As I sat on the cold tile floor of the bathroom, disgusted by the taste of puke on my tongue, I remembered seeing that old photo album set out on the credenza in the sitting room. My mother must have placed it there during the memorial service.

I walked slowly from the bathroom to the sitting room, feeling afraid in my grandfathers' home for the very first time. This home had been the source of much happiness in my life and, up until that phone call, I’d never felt anything but entirely comforted by time spent here. Grabbing the photo album off the credenza, I settled onto the couch, confident that my upset stomach was no longer a threat to the floral fabric. The photo album was thick in my hands. The leather binding was tattered and fraying along the spine. I felt compelled to look through the album. I’m not sure what I was hoping to gain from it. Comfort, information, or maybe just a distraction from the overbearing confusion I had felt since waking up that morning.

Opening the album to a random page in the middle, I was greeted by a photo of my grandfather and me seated together on the wingback chair. We were both smiling. That damn phone was visible to the left of my small body. I frowned at the telephone in the photo before glancing up to frown at it in its current position across the room. Returning my focus to the photos in my lap, I turned just one more page and set my eyes upon a yellowing black and white photo of two small boys. I removed the photo from its plastic restraint and flipped it over, reading the scrawled handwriting on the back.

*Warren and Louis, 1949.*

My heart jumped in my chest at the sight of the mysterious caller. At the confirmation that he was, or had been at one point, a living human who knew my grandfather. Returning the photo to its home in the album, I notice a newspaper clipping stuck in a pocket on the opposite page. Upon further inspection, I determined that it was an obituary. A handsome young man beamed at me from the yellowed paper.

*Louis Hartzog.*

*Beloved son, brother, and friend.*

*1937-1965*

The confidence I briefly had in my gurgling stomach was shaken once again. The obituary confirmed what I already knew to be true but couldn’t quite comprehend.

I really had spoken to a dead man on the phone.

And he plans to call again tonight.

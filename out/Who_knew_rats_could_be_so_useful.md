I definitely hated rats my whole life. That one fear I could never get past. They're disgusting. They're fast. They zip around and are easy to miss. They bite. Spread disease. They're awful. 

But lately, I don't know... I'm beginning to think they're alright. Might have something to do with my late brother. And how he went insane. None of us could help him. I'm the one who tried the hardest. It wasn't enough. Nothing was enough to pull him back from the abyss. 

I just wish I could've caught him sooner. 

My brother Damien was the younger one. It was just the three of us - Damien, his big sister (yours truly) and our mom. Our dad was sent off to some institution a long time ago. We never really knew for what reason. Barely remember him now. So it's always been the three of us - and we've always been a team. We grew up in rural America, in an old house we inherited from my dad's side of the family. My mom worked as a maid in richer homes. I'd go to school with Damien - walking two hours both ways. We always ate the same bland garbage (cabbage and ground turkey were incessant) and we only got to wash our clothes once a week, sometimes even less. We were dirty. I have no problem saying it. I hated the way we lived. And I hated the rats we had around the house. So, so much. I'd woken up so many times to the feeling of rats on my hands, on my feet, trying to bite. I was a light sleeper. I never let them. But they always tried. I hated that life. I wanted more than anything to save mom and Damien, take them somewhere better.

At least we had each other. Mom wanted a better life for us too. So she insisted we go to school, study, go to college. I did. I became a college professor teaching criminal justice. Nothing glamorous, but it let me give my family a proper home. Moved my mom in, asked Damien to come so many times. 

But Damien was different. He wanted to make his own way. He didn't finish high school. Dropped out right before final year. He got a job at an auto shop in the city, and he got himself an apartment. He worked so many hours. Countless, I barely spoke to him those years. He wouldn't show up for Christmas or Thanksgiving. He'd be too tired to talk when I called him to wish him happy birthday. Even his friends told me he was growing distant. I got worried. Mom got worried. 

So I went out to meet him one weekend. No notice, no warning. I didn't want him making excuses. I showed up at his apartment. It was a dingy little place, paint peeling, weird smells. When I knocked, he opened the door, all shocked and happy to see me. I could tell it was an act. He just didn't want me there. Why? What did I do? What did I ever do that you'd hate me, Damien? 

Too dead to answer me now. All I ever wanted to do was take care of him. Of them both. They're family. 

Damien's apartment had rats. I saw one scurry past my foot the second I stepped in. I screamed, and he laughed. Said it's no big deal, and he's got traps for them. I hated his place. Hated how he kept himself. This is the rut we were born into - but it didn't have to be the life we chose. I chose a better life. Why couldn't he?

Damien has offered me a beer, which I refused, since I had to drive back. We talked about nothing for a few minutes and he said he had to get some sleep before his night shift. I finally asked him why he's been so distant from us. To which he was so... Offended. He said he wasn't distant, just tired. And he told me I didn't know him. That he'd been working all this time so that he could surprise mom on her birthday the coming week. I was pretty surprised. Did not expect that. 

But when her birthday rolled around, I saw what he'd been talking about. He pulled into our driveway with a gleaming Honda CRV. His own car. Brand new, fully loaded. He'd jokingly said "It's for you, mom" even though he knew she didn't drive anymore. It was a gift for himself. Nonetheless, I felt happy for him - seeing so much hard work pay off is a good feeling, especially for my Damien. 

That day, on mom's birthday, Damien insisted she take her for a drive. I said no, because he'd had a few beers. He started yelling about how he's not a lightweight, how he's driven on much worse and been fine - how I didn't know him.

There it was again. "You don't know me." Why would he say that? We grew up together.

I didn't fight any further. I probably should have. I waited for him to invite me along for the ride, but... he just didn't. He said they'd be back in an hour. Mom noticed my face and probably thought she should keep us separate for a while. So she didn't insist I join them either. She'd said to me, "don't forget to preheat the oven!" right before the door closed. She was going to make brownies for us when they got back. I'd been helping her make the batter earlier that day.

I think I can smell the batter right now. It's not good anymore, though. But I know it's still there. Right where mom left it. But it smells awful now. I'm sure I can bake the smell right out.

I waited an hour. Then two. Then I called mom. Called Damien. No answer.

Hour number three, I get a knock on the door. Two police officers.

Damien had driven his brand new car straight into a telephone pole, at a speed high enough to completely cave in the front half of the vehicle. Like it wasn't even there. I remember getting out of the police van when they took me to the scene. Only so much I could make out, beyond the barricades they'd set up. The soft-voiced officer who told me their deduction of what happened to my family was sympathetic, I think. It was his job. He said Damien - who apparently didn't have his seat belt on - had flown right out of the windshield, fallen into brambles off the freeway. He had eight broken bones. Skin was so lacerated, he was barely recognizable in the hospital. He'd lost an eye to the thorns he'd landed in. Wounds, infected. My brother was unrecognizable, tied up in bandages in his room, unable to turn his head, or look at anyone or anything - or speak. He could've been anyone else, and I wouldn't be able to tell.

Like I didn't know him at all.

But he was alive, though. When they told me what happened to mom, I remember screaming. Not because of what the officer did say - but what he chose to leave out, trying to spare me the anguish.

You see, mom *was* wearing her seatbelt. It's ironic. She didn't fly out of the car, but got trapped inside. The car was burnt to ash when I saw it at the scene, but the fire was big enough that I could see the ash clouds on the horizon when they were driving me down there. When they finally pulled her out, I could see her skull peering through torn bits of ragged flesh that used to be her face. Melty, runny and oozy - her body wasn't even human. The officer tried to tell me she would've died of asphyxiation before the fire could've gotten to her flesh - but I knew that was a lie. I saw the open jaw of her skull, bare bones and teeth spilling out a scream that didn't seem to end. Her beautiful hair, left to crumbly wisps dangling off her mangled skull. Her birthday outfit that I'd bought her - an electric blue dress with a faux fur shawl that went with it - hanging off her like tendrils, consumed by fire until mere threads were left.

Damien couldn't make it to her funeral. The doctor told me he was paralyzed from the neck down. He'd flown a good distance, banged his spine on some rocks, or something. I dunno. He couldn't move on his own anymore. All his hard work, gone to ashes. All that time he spent distancing himself from us, for nothing. Why? What was the big deal about getting a car? Giving mom a ride? All we needed was for you to be there.

But I don't go back on my promises. I take care of my family. I've always taken care of Damien. When his wounds had healed enough, they told me I could take him home - but they strongly suggested I put him in a long term care facility.

Nah. They don't know me. Family is everything to me. Mom was everything to me.

I took Damien back to our house and put him in mom's bedroom. So he could smell her on the sheets. See her books and her watches and her clothes and her favorite colors painted on the walls. Lay in the same bed she did, sleep where she slept. See, Damien? This is how you take care of family. Look at this room. Mom got everything she ever wanted, thanks to me. All you gave her, all you *ever* gave her - was pain. So much pain. I can't even imagine dying like that.

But you, you lived. And now you can't even speak. Now I have to clean your shit and wipe your ass and bathe you and feed you. I've looked after you for weeks. Even after all this time... you and I are still in the gutter. And it's all your fault.

So I decided to make a choice. Today. This morning. I took Damien out for a stroll, told him we'd go to the park. But we didn't. I wheeled him back to his own apartment. I had his keys. I put a mask on and opened the door - the mask did nothing to cover the stench. His place was more than filthy. It was a hell hole. And the rats...

So many.

They squealed and screeched when the door opened. Some of them spilled out and scurried past my feet. For some reason, I didn't cringe the way I used to. I ignored them. I wheeled Damien inside.

I remember Damien huffing and grunting - all he could manage to do at that point - when I brought him in. He didn't like it here. He wanted to leave. He was groaning, his head hanging off to one side, drool dripping onto his shoulder.

"This is where you belong," I'd told him. And I'd tilted the wheelchair forward, quick and hard, throwing him to the floor.

And I folded up the wheelchair, and shut the door behind me. I left. The stench was awful. But the rats were plentiful. And they'd give Damien the same horror he'd given mom. Even as I left, looking back, I saw one of them climbing onto his face, nibbling on his ear. I heard him groan - but he couldn't make any noise loud enough for anyone to care. Especially not in this shitty building, where screaming and shouting was regular ambience.

I felt reassured. Nature doesn't discriminate. Rats feed. Animals hunt. Fire burns. Bones break. Food rots.

I came home and finally decided to eat mom's brownie batter. I scraped the fungus off and scarfed it down. It was so insanely good. I cried. I miss you, mom. But look - you're always with me. Here, in my house. And the rats, so useful - they're gonna make things right. Damien belongs with them. He never left that dirty little house we grew up in. He was always there. So I sent him back.

Are you proud of me, mom?

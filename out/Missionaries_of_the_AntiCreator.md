 "There is no mass we hold. Our church lies in nothingness and emptiness. We feel our savior's presence when we experience crushing despair and disenchantment of not only our lives, but of existence itself. We have no sacrament for nothing is our sacrament. We only have the Gospel: the Gospel of the Anti-Creator.

The harrowing devastating Word of our true savior is that all of existence is unholy. This includes the forces of good and evil, angels and demons, Heaven and Hell. While those two forces wage a meaningless war against each other, we strive to bring it all to a glorious terrifying end.

Angels and demons alike have fought for centuries to silence us, for they both hold a similar fear: the Void. Total infinite black nothingness where nothing exists except for the ruler of it: the Anti-Creator. We seek to give passage to existence for the Anti-Creator, so It may swallow us whole. The Gospel of our savior has been kept hidden from mankind by both religious organizations and the forces of Hell. That is why you have barely if not at all heard of our cause. We do not blame you. But we do not care for your previous obliviousness. For even with everything fighting in unison to stop us, we still persevere and draw closer to achieving our ultimate goal of total existential annihilation across every dimension.

Why I speak to you, investigator, is because you invited us. You wanted to know what else was out there that was beyond the forces of good and evil. There is us, the forces of the Void. If you wish to join us on our holy crusade against all of Creation, you must be willing to listen to what we have to say and take the steps that we will inform you of.

Cast aside all natural addictions such as the addiction to sexual ecstasy, the desire for power, the desire for love, the desire for trivial revenge against another person, the desire for anything except for the desire to have all that exists wiped clean, permanently. You must cast aside comforting delusions of life and existence itself to open your mind to the reality of this, of everything. It will be disheartening, horrifying, disturbing, depressing and sobering. But that is what reality is.

Nothing transcendentally good has come from existence. It has been and always will be malignantly worthless and futile madness and chaos that is blindly going nowhere for nothing.

What you must also do is sever connections to the addictions that can blind you from this reality. Permanent chemical castration is required. And not just castration for the sexual drive, but for hunger and thirst as well. With the help of a specially created substance with the help of the Anti-Creator's influence, we have been able to overcome our natural addictions along with worldly ones as well. Take it and you no longer need to worry of having to endlessly satisfy your bodily needs.

Another step is to meditate in total darkness and let in the Anti-Creator's presence in its purest form. You will feel a divine Void bloom within you like a vantablack flower that eats both heavenly light and hellfire. It will leave you with your spirit and mind in total unmatched clarity.

The rest, we will guide you with after you take that step.

If you have doubts now, let us help you annihilate them.

Unlearn all cultural and religious indoctrinated ideas including that of morality. See them for what they are: manipulative instruments to sway you in whatever direction man, Heaven and Hell wishes you to go for their own benefit.

Now, look at your biological strings from outside of yourself. Do you see how they bind you and cause you to dance the way Nature wishes? To blindly spread itself towards nowhere is its goal. Do you wish to be a puppet, a slave, to something that cares only for itself? Or do you wish to annihilate all puppeteers and all masters? Do you wish to be liberated from it all?

We can see it in your eyes, you're tired of repeating the same thing over and over again. And you fear the afterlife, which is an eternity of repetitious cycles no matter the differences. You know that no matter the change in the cycle, it will still continue towards nothing, for nothing because of something's narcissistic self-interest.

Do not try to deny it, don't let it deceive you. The instinct to rationalize the meaninglessness and insanity of everything is strong, but the Void is stronger. Seek deep into that tattered soul of yours. The Void was there before Creation. It was empty of all that binds and all that destroys others for its own survival.

You've seen the Void in visions here and there when in states of total emotional emptiness that gives way to unbiased mental clarity. Do you feel it now? Do you see it now?"

After the man shrouded in total blackness asked me that in his inhumanly low voice, I felt something indescribable. It wasn't positive nor negative. It was foreign beyond human words. It was as if a spiritual black hole sprouted within my spirit and began to grow slowly, but the power it emanated was immense.

The abysmal priest's Stygian aura began to eat the daylight that foolishly entered the room. There was no drop in temperature, but a numbness, as if temperature itself vacated. As I dwelt more on what he told me and remembered those visions he spoke of, that spiritual black hole swiftly grew.

It's as if everything I was ever told to believe to be true was being helplessly swallowed by this black hole. The things that were taught to me by the religious, atheists, satanists, society and every culture that wanted me to live the way they desired.

A powerful clarity then washed over me like a colossal wave that only an extinction-leveled meteor could create. Everything was blind chaos that only cared for its own interest, no matter the cost, no matter the pain, no matter the insanity. And it would keep going like this for eternity.

This black hole inside me finished devouring every illusion that was forced into my mind and my life. I stepped up from my chair and looked into the ominously glowing violet eyes of this priest of the Anti-Creator.

Both of our hands reach out simultaneously and as soon as we gripped each other's hands tightly, my consciousness was opened to the future.

Every dimension, every universe, including our own, was to be devoured by the Anti-Creator. A being that could only be described as an infinite vantablack shroud of tendrils that devoured everything to ever exist. Heaven and its angels were swallowed into its nothingness. Hell and its demons fell to the same terrifyingly divine fate.

As for Earth, it was not spared from the same destiny. All of mankind, every organism and every atom was annihilated into oblivion. The seemingly infinite universe and multiverse was eaten by the Anti-Creator without discrimination. Then: nothingness. Just infinite nothingness. The end to the eternity of existence itself, swallowed into the black eternal Void.

No more insanity. No more futility. No more agony. No more ecstasy. Nothing left.

I was shown the truth and the future of everything, of course I accepted to join the divine mission of total existential annihilation.

And so I have left my absurd banal life behind and have become part of something greater than anything than anyone can fathom.

Now we draw closer to opening the portal for the Anti-Creator to come through and deliver us a glorious terrifying obliteration from the insanity of existence. Nothing can stop the Void. Nothing can stop the Anti-Creator.

Hello. Read everything carefully to ensure your safety. I don’t have much time to write this. Remember how when you turn off the lights then run to your room? Don’t do that. It sees all. The creature in the hall smells your fear. That will make you a target. As a child I would always run to my room. Bad decision on my part. My tips to survive if you’ve ran even once are the following
1) Lock everything
2)Make sure you have a weapon
3)Have a flashlight always
4)Don’t sleep for the next few nights
5) It mimics your loved ones. Never trust anyone
6)Øpęñ thę døõr
7)Don’t make noises
8)It will mess with any electronic item. This include phones, TVs, radios, etc.
Follow these and you should be fine. But you can never be to sure. Walk to your room when you try to go to bed. And make sure you have water food or anything you might need for the night. This is because once you enter your bedroom you can’t leave. Leave equals death. Don’t use electronic devices. That is a way it can get into your room. It might try and manipulate this text even to get you to open the door. Don’t open the door at all. Don’t run to your room. Grab anything you might need for the night. Don’t listen to it. If you see a tall shadow in the corner of your room, it’s to late for you. He’s gotten in. Try to survive as long as possible. If you have to move houses, move houses.   Łęãvê thę røôm Łęãvê thę røôm Łęãvê thę  røôm Łęãvê thę røôm. God save us all. Your future is in your hands for the next few nights. You might just have to kill yourself if needed. I will be moving from home shortly. If I don’t post updates, I am dead.

Update: I made it. Moved to an entire different country. Also if your wondering why I’m use an electronic to type this even though you aren’t supposed to, it’s because I am breaking the rules. Just to warn everyone reading. I might even die from it. I don’t know. Moved to live with some friends in Canada. Think I’m safe here. I’ll do another update soon.


Update: I think it followed me. I don’t know how. I flew here. But I’m hearing things outside right now. My friends are here with me. Also somehow it trapped us in endless nighttime. The sun never rises. God please help me.


Update: It got in. It’s in the kitchen. We are eating it from the cams we installed. We might be screwed. My phones about dead. I’m going to charge it. No update means I have died. Good luck to you all.


Update: We see the figure in the corner. Means we are about to die. Guess it’s better than this. Hope you guys get what you want. I got what I want. I hope it’s peaceful. Probably won’t be though. Bye.

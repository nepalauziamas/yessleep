I still have my decorations up. People keep saying that I’m crazy, but no one understands. I need to get it off my chest, but who can I tell? I feel like I need to spread the word, because I’ve been trying so hard to protect people. 

But it seems like it’s been getting worse and worse every year…

I still remember that day. The day that changed me forever—Halloween. I know it’s July, but it doesn’t matter. Holiday’s are one of our most common rituals and I’ve learned to fear what they protect us from. I’m here to warn you. And I hope my story sparks an interest in your heart that may one day save your life. 

I guess I’ll get right into it…

For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted to help people. Even my costumes on Halloween were always some sort of public servant. From firefighters, to doctors—it was always about saving lives. Ya know? So it was only natural that I became a cop, right? Yeah…

Anyway… There was this serial killer that would only operate during the month of October, the sick bastard. He would do things—he would do things—to children. He’d pick a house as his base of operations, a different house every year. And the things he would do to those poor families… the ones who didn’t celebrate, the ones who didn’t care for such festivities. 

One time, I was called to a scene where a fresh dog corpse was flayed open and fashioned into a overstuffed candy sack; filled with all the popular sweets. All the candy out of their wrappers, covered in blood, shit—and something else. It’s eyes were popping out of its head while candy, vomit and bile spilled from its mouth. Placed on the porch to temp anyone with a tooth sweet enough to grab a taste. I remember immediately drawing out my pistol, and approaching the house to go inside. Trying not to vomit as I passed by that poor creature. 

You know what’s one thing you never forget? Sights are one thing—sure. But smells… you never forget. You see crazy shit on TV all the time, so it kinda prepares you in a way. But smells—no preparation for that. No “smell-o-vision” shit to fuck around with when you’re sitting alone in your living room. Just the real deal. I can’t even begin to describe to you the stench that was wafting from that house’s open door. The sickly sweetness of it… the thickness it had. The oily residue that it left on my tongue and in my throat… it still lives with me.

Sigh… when think about it now, whenever I think about it, I don’t know why I didn’t call for backup right away. I think I was on autopilot or something. I really wish… fuck it, never mind. 

So I walked into the house, pistol drawn; holding it so tightly that I could literally feel the sweat being squeezed out from my palm, cold water bleeding onto the handle of my weapon. The house was nearly silent, except for the TV on in the living area; blasting sounds of a horror marathon and casting shadows. Everything was neat and tidy—no signs of struggle. That was until… I got into the kitchen. At first, all I could see through the doorway was a long dining table with several pumpkins sitting atop it. But as I slowly walked into that room… I saw them. 

It looked like the mother was tied to a chair and forced to watch her loved ones suffer. Bound in a place where she and her family sat and shared countless meals, memories and good times. Never imagining that this would be the place of her greatest horror. The place where she would watch her kids die. 

I knew she was forced to watch because her eyelids were neatly sliced off her face, dried blood and tears ran down her cheeks and dyed her non festive sweater a dark red. On the other side of the table, sat a pair of twin girls—maybe ten or eleven in age. Their cheeks ripped open from the sides of their mouths, stuffed with more pumpkin flesh than their little faces could handle. Their stomachs poking out from being force fed until they died. Orange, red, and brown matter seeping out from beneath their little pink dresses. Fuck…

Once I saw that, I ran out the house. I just… I just couldn’t! Okay!? I just couldn’t see… I couldn’t, I couldn’t…

I ran back into my car, to try and catch my breath. Maybe, to try and catch my mind. But there he was. Right on the edge of the old woods. There “it” was. Evil yellow light spilling from its face like liquid, the blood from that family on its deformed hands. And roots growing directly out the flesh of its legs… it wasn’t human. It wasn’t something that belonged here. It was like… it tried to dress up like us. Like it was trying to trick me, but couldn’t move like we do. 

It stared at me. Into me. Through me. And then… it smiled at me. I was frozen, trapped in my own body. Pinned to my car seat under the weight of its gaze. I watched. I watched as it shuffled off into the woods. It’s movements so grotesque and wrong… that it’s hard to describe in words.

They say that we dress up once a year to scare the evil spirits away, and offer treats to pacify them. A ritual. So now, I celebrate Halloween every-single-day. I want to protect us… I want to protect you. Happy Halloween…

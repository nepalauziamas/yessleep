So, like 30 minutes ago, Me and my roommate had a huge argument, cause she just doesn't cooperate with the chores. She doesn't take out the garbage or wash the dishes when its her night. Nope, she just doesn't do anything.

To calm myself down, I went for a walk. Going for a walk always puts me in a somewhat good mood.

While coming back I had to wait at a zebra crossing. While waiting, I spotted a guy at the other end at the road. He looked....peculiar.

His sleeves were very long, he could trip on it with ease. His hair went below his ears, and he was continuously looking at the ground. Well, if this was any other incident, I could've sworn he reminded me of an anime character, but not this time.

Playfully, I asked myself *'Is he a ghost?'* and then laughed at my imagination. 

Ghosts in broad daylight? Nah, just not possible. Also ghosts don't exist.

I looked back at him, and he was now looking straight. His hair even covered his eyes, so I couldn't say if he was looking straight at me or no.

The signal turned green, and I started walking. Whilst going to the other side, the mysterious guy walked past me, and I'm 1000% sure he said *"How did you know?"* 

I froze on the spot, not caring about the people walking past me.

*Was that meant for me?* I wondered.

What he had said was pretty loud I couldn't have been the only one who heard it. But as far as I remember, no one except me had paid attention to him.

I started to panic. Was he really a ghost? I looked back to see if he was there. Well, he wasn't.

I then ran to my house. While running, I could swear I could see a shadow keeping up with me. It was not my shadow. I even checked back a couple of times, but no one was running with, or after me. 

I quickly ran up the stairs to my apartment and slammed the door behind me after I got it.

Denise(my roommate) looked at me with utter shock as I locked the door behind me.

"J-Jenna?" she stuttered, coming close to me. "You're here... now?"

"Uhh, yeah?" I said, confused with her behavior. "Why are you asking me this?"

"Jenna, you came earlier. I know you did! You're supposed to be in the bathroom."

"What?" I said in confusion again. "You saw me come in now!"

"Yeah, I saw you now. But, earlier when I was cooking I heard the door open and close! And I even apologized to you from the kitchen. And... and you said you're going to the bathroom!"

"What?" I said, in shock. "I never came before! I came right now!"

I went to the bathroom, but no one was there.

Just then, we both heard a loud knock. I cautiously approached the door, and saw who was outside though the hole.

It was that guy. The guy from the road, who I thought was a ghost. Well, now I know he's a ghost.

"Come out!" He said, in a now different voice. "Come out now! I know you know my secret."

He is a ghost, but it seems he can't go through walls like the ghosts in movies.

"Denise," I said. "The guy I had seen on the road, who I know is a ghost now, Is here. At our door!"

*An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Five lovers slain, five dark lessons to learn.*

[[Part 1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x4bxtt/i_found_every_girlfriend_ive_ever_had_lined_up/) I awoke to find **every girlfriend** I've ever had lined up **dead** on my living room floor. Then came [the photos](https://i.redd.it/wpe286mlail91.jpg) and the twisted game.

[[Part 2]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x5kl0v/i_found_every_girlfriend_ive_ever_had_lined_up/) My **worst fear** realised as the game took a menacing turn.

I ran back down Oat Street as fast as I could.

As soon as I reached Alex's house I was hammering on the front door.

Me: “Alex! It’s me! Let me in!”

She wasn't answering.

Just as I was considering breaking in through a window, Alex finally unlocked the door and appeared. She was newly dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. I rushed inside.

Me: “Is everything okay? Why did you take so long to answer?”

Alex: “I was getting dressed. What happened out there? Why are you so freaked out?”

Me: “Nothing. I panicked is all.”

Alex: “Nothing? You didn’t see the killer?”

Me: “I don’t think so. Just a bunch of people going about their day.”

Alex: “Well, did any of them look suspicious?”

Me: “Not that I could tell.”

Alex: “And what about the church? The grave?”

Me: “I left my tissue roll there but the churchyard was empty. I didn’t see anybody.”

Alex: “Okay. It’s time to call the police.”

Me: “No, there’s still time to catch the killer out.”

Alex: “Five women are dead, they’ll be missed. Somebody has probably called the police already. There’s no point delaying any more.”

Me: “Alex, trust me. If we call the police it won’t end well for us.”

Alex: “How do you know?”

Me: “I just do.”

Alex gave me a questioning look.

Alex: “What happened out there?”

There was a heavy pause, and then my phone pinged.

Saved by the bell.

I pulled my phone from my pocket and saw that I had another email.

Me: “It’s the killer.”

Alex: “Read it to me.”

I started to read aloud:

*An earlobe is not an ear. Luckily for you I laughed so hard when you dropped it that I’m willing to forgive your blunder. I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson about vanity.*

*Consider Sarah Finnegan, modest and humble despite being the star player at your old tennis club. You on the other hand have always been a teller of tales, never afraid to talk yourself up or to talk others down. The murder weapon is underneath the kitchen sink in your house. Retrieve it and bring it back to Alex’s house by 2pm.*

*Be advised, I’m calling the police and local news. I’m telling tales.*

I lowered my phone, not even opening the picture attached to the email.

Me: “They’re calling in the murders, I have to go.”

Alex: “Don't be an idiot. If the police catch you with the bodies and the murder weapon you’ll be screwed.”

Me: “I’ll be in and out before they get there.”

I turned towards the front door, but Alex grabbed my arm.

Alex: “You’re walking straight into a trap.”

Me: “Don't you think I know that? I have to go, you don’t understand.”

Alex: “Why don’t I understand? What aren’t you telling me?”

I broke free of Alex's grip.

Me: “There’s no time to explain right now. Just stay here. Don't let anyone in except me.”

And with that I rushed outside.

Alex slammed the door behind me.

I had no idea how much time I had to get to my house before anyone else arrived. But I knew it couldn’t be long.

Depending on exactly who the killer called, and on what they said, someone could be there in minutes. I've always known I can run but I can’t fight. I needed to be in and out before anything could go wrong. I sprinted hard.

Once I reached the scruffy little avenue that I lived on I stopped and, breathing heavily, surveyed the scene.

The avenue was silent, empty. I took a step forwards but my phone started to ring. 

I pulled it from my pocket and examined the screen. The caller ID said “Home”. My parents. They’d probably heard about my photo, but there wasn’t any time to talk. I switched off and pocketed my phone.

Then, very cautiously, I approached my front door. I looked around the avenue one last time, turned the handle and pushed the door open. I hadn’t even bothered to lock it when I left. 

The house was quiet. I crept along the hallway until I reached the living room door. It was closed. I never close the living room door, something was wrong. I opened the living room door and stepped inside. There were no dead bodies, the floor was bare.

Where were they? Had they got up and left? Had I imagined it all? Then, through the living room window, I saw a police car pull into my avenue.

It parked and two police officers, a man and a woman, stepped out.

It was the kind of horror where the floor feels like it's suddenly dropped away from you and your blood turns ice cold in your veins.

I rushed out of the living room and made straight for the kitchen before they could see me through the window. As soon as I knelt in front of the kitchen sink there was a loud knock at the front door and a raised voice.

Policeman: “This is the police. We received a distress call concerning this address.”

I rifled through the cupboard below the sink looking for the murder weapon.

I found it in the back corner behind a bottle of bleach: a vicious looking hunting knife. I heard the policeman speak again.

Policeman: “Your front door is unlocked, I’m coming in.”

I sprung upright and turned to look at the long hallway between the kitchen and the front door, the policeman was stepping inside. Then his radio went off.

Policewoman: “Bodies in the garden. Repeat, we have bodies in the garden.”

The second officer must have gone through the side gate into my garden. There was only one thing to do. 

I charged at the policeman standing in my open doorway. He was a big guy, but I had the whole length of the hallway to pick up speed. I held the hunting knife out of the way and shoulder barged the policeman down onto the doorstep.

I just about managed to stay upright and used my momentum to leap over him.

Still holding the murder weapon I sprinted for an alleyway between two houses on the opposite side of my avenue. It had a chain link fence at the end of it, but I was up and over in a flash.

*

The next half an hour was spent taking back streets and side roads to Alex's house. 

I even found a mankey old shirt to wrap the hunting knife in. There were still spots of blood on the blade and I really didn't want to be reminded of what the knife had taken from the world.

At last, I ended up in the alleyway behind Alex's back garden. I climbed a brick wall and dropped into her flowerbed. I brushed the soil from my knees and made my way to Alex’s back door.

I knocked harshly.

Me: “Alex! Open up!”

There was no answer so I tried the door. It opened.

I stepped inside.

I walked through the kitchen, everything was quiet.

Me: “Alex? Where are you?”

Still no answer so I stepped  into the hallway.

Me: “Alex! It’s me! I’m back!”

Silence. Dread. Something was badly wrong.

Then a phone started to ring. That weird Brahms’ Hungarian Dance ringtone Alex showed me in the pub a couple of weeks ago. It was her phone. It was coming from the floor above so I raced up the stairs.

I followed the sound into Alex's bedroom. Alex's phone was on her bed, still ringing. 

The caller ID was “UNKNOWN CALLER”. I answered.

Me: “What have you done with Alex?”

The eerie voice on the other end was distorted somehow. I couldn't tell who I was speaking to.

Caller: “An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. I hope you’ve learned a valuable lesson about telling tales.”

Me: “Where is Alex? Your graveyard letter said you wouldn’t hurt her if I did what you said.”

Caller: “What you love the most is perfectly well, but I’ll slit her throat from ear to ear if you don’t calm down.”

Me: “Okay, just don’t – don’t hurt her. Please.”

Caller: “Good boy. Now, you’re going to come to the university campus, to the Humanities building. Your next task is waiting for you on the roof.”

Me: “But all that way, what if the police–”

Caller: “No dawdling. Be there by 5pm. You know what will happen to Alex if you defy me. And dump your phone, bring Alex’s instead. Bring the knife too. Do you understand?”

Me: “Yes, 5pm Humanities building roof. Alex’s phone and knife. Are you going to tell me why you're doing this to me? Who you are?”

Caller: “Why I'm doing this? No, I'm not going to tell you that yet. Who I am? That's an interesting question. Over the years I have used many names, but I think my favourite is … Rose.”

The line went dead.

*

That name. **Rose**. Revealing that alias was the killer’s first big mistake.

Ever since that day I've been in hiding, but I've not been idle. I've been trawling the Internet on this rickety old laptop looking for signs of Rose. At the end of last month, I finally found what I was searching for.

On r/NoSleep, a personal [account of a paranormal encounter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wzqzy7/no_one_knows_what_really_happened_up_whistler/) involving someone called Rose. I followed the updates and, by the end of the testimony, I was certain that this Rose and my tormentor were one and the same. I messaged the owner of the Reddit account, MM. She agreed with me.

MM is okay after her encounter, just a bit shaken up. She thinks the spirit never meant her any harm, it just needed a vessel to help complete its unfinished business. Frustratingly, no one in Pitwell believes MM’s account. I believe her, though.

We've been talking online ever since that first message, discussing Rose and collating all of our evidence. MM is an excellent researcher. She has a knack for finding historical documents with Rose’s fingerprints all over them. You can take a look at a couple of things MM found [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/mediamusing/comments/x3xxf0/potential_rose_evidence/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/user/mediamusing/comments/x41e6i/rose_blog/). They bring into question what Rose even *is*, and precisely what her connection to the Rose she supposedly stole her name from might be. Decide for yourself.

MM even gave me her login so I could put my testimony on the record in the same place as hers.

The big problem we have now that we've gathered all of this material is what the hell do we do next? Look for more victims? Go deeper into hiding? Find a way to take Rose on? Is that a fight we could ever really win? All of these questions are making my brain hurt.

Final part to follow.

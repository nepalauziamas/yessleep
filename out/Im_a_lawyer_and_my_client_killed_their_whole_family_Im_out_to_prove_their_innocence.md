I’ve seen a lot of open and shut cases in my day, but Anthony Coltan took the cake. 

When I got assigned his case as a public defender, I actually thought it was payback because of a mistake that had cost my bosses a pretty penny a few months back. 

You see, all the evidence proved without a shadow of doubt that Anthony killed his whole family. The security footage from his closed circuit network showed everything happen in excruciating detail. How he stabbed his wife first and then used a pillow to asphyxiate his two girls. 

Even though there wasn’t any audio on the feed, watching the struggle his family put up to fight back was the most difficult thing I have ever had to see in my entire career. 

After reviewing the notes taken by forensics and talking with the DA, I was finally ready to meet my client. 

The man in the waiting room painted a different picture than the one I had just seen on screen. He was trembling, his eyes darting suspiciously around the room. He was afraid. 

“*Mister Coltan? I’m your attorney, Leo Ross.*” 

“Thank God. I was starting to think this was a set up too. You’re not wearing a wire are you? No, no I can tell; you’re safe. Good. Maybe there’s still time.” 

“*Slow down there, one thing at a time. Just what exactly are you talking about?*” 

“I’m talking about my life, Mister Ross! The State wants to lock me away for good… but if I do that, oh god. What will happen to them??” 

“*You’re not making any sense. What will happen to who?*” 

“My family! Dear God, I have to find them and save them!”

I must’ve stared at him for a good long minute before I finally answered back. 

“*Mister Coltan, your family is dead…*” 

“No. No no no. That’s exactly what they want you to think.” 

“*I’ve reviewed the evidence. It’s pretty indisputable.*” 

“I’m telling you I’m innocent Mister Ross!!”

There was this dangerous unhinged look in his eyes whenever he said this. The kind of look you give to someone when you are desperate for them to believe you. I'm not quite sure why, call it instinct or maybe those years of experience I touched on earlier; but when he said those four words... I wanted to believe him. 


I took out an audio recorder and sat down across from him. 

“*Tell me exactly what happened that night, Anthony.*”

He was nervous to even speak, his body language still distrusting. 

“*You’re going to need to trust me.*” 

I was thinking his paranoia might get him to spill. I was also thinking if I could nail a confession on tape quickly I would be out of here in time for lunch with Harry. Things didn’t go that way for me though. 

Instead, Anthony told me a story I doubt I will ever forget. 


"Okay... so. I came home from work early, I wanted to surprise Martha and the girls and take them to that new playground, you know the one? It opened up over there on seventh and broad. Anyway, when I got to the house I noticed something was wrong right away. I don't really know how to describe it. But something felt off, you know? But I tried to shrug it off. I went inside to the den, and saw the girls playing video games. Martha was in the kitchen. Except... and this is the part where no one believes me. I know... that they weren't my family." 

I didn't say a word. I was too worried that if I did I might freeze up the story he was giving me. 

"Oh, don't get me wrong. They acted like my family. But I just... I *knew*. For one thing Martha wasn't surprised about me coming home early. And for another, the girls didn't want to go to the park. I told them that was fine and went upstairs to grab a shower. Man. I must have stayed in that bathroom for an hour trying to figure out what to do. Did I run? Call the police? I mean, what would I even say? 'Hello, I think my family isn't my family'; they would laugh it off!"

"*Stay on point, Mister Coltan. What happened next?*" 

He was getting more nervous with each second.I was afraid he might clamp up. 

"I went back downstairs. They were there waiting for me. I saw the one who looked like  my wife was making dinner, lasagna casserole.  It smelled so good. But I knew if I hesitated that something might happen. So I told her I would help plate the food. Dinner was perfect, but I made sure they ate first. To know if it was poisoned or not, ya know? Anyway after dinner I went and tidied up the kitchen. I never do that shit. Martha.... Or whoever, came up and kissed me and said thank you. I felt sick when she touched me. I wanted to just scream and run. But I held it together, god I don't know how but I did. I went to go tuck the girls in and read them  a story. I bet you have never read a story as quickly as I did. For the life of me I can't remember what that book was.... *Katie loves the Kittens* that was the one. They laughed at the right parts and said they loved me when it was over. But I swear they were watching me when I left the room." 


"*Then you went to your bedroom.*" 

"I wanted to just get out of there. But I needed to know. Where my real family was. I said a prayer and talked to the woman standing there in my room. She stared at me and refused to cooperate That's when I snapped. You saw... you know what happened. I grabbed her and shoved her to the bed, demanding I see my real wife." 

He looked at his trembling hands. 

"The rest... you know the rest." 

"*I need you to say it on the record, Anthony. Did you kill them? Did you harm your family?*" 

Suddenly he was staring at me suspiciously. "Haven't you been listening? I told you they weren't my family..." 

Then his eyes widened. 


“You don’t believe me.”

“*I must admit that is quite a fantastical series of events. But if you want my support, if what you are saying is true, then I need some sort of evidence." 

He seemed thoughtful as he stared down at the floor. There was a knock on the door and one of the officers that had brought him in told him it was time to go back to holding. 

My client looked desperate to provide me some means of believing his insane conspiracy. And then a look of realization crossed his face. He pulled out a ring from his pocket and pushed it into my palm. 

"Martha's wedding ring! It didn't fit on her finger!! The imposter I mean! It was too small!" he proclaimed as he was taken away.

I know I sat there for a long moment, trying to figure out if I was crazy for believing the words of a triple murderer. But I did. Something about his demeanor told me that in his mind he thought he had done the right thing. 
If so then it changed everything about this case. 

So I called up a friend of mine that works at the county morgue to get a chance to see the bodies up close. "You sure about that? I've worked a lot of corpses and I got to say, these three are some of the worst I ever seen..." 

When I got there I found out what he meant. The three were nearly unrecognizable the way that Coltan had beaten and brutalized them. This seemed more and more like a vicious and premeditated murder. 

"Guy was pretty smart. Bashing the skulls in to break the teeth messes up the dental match. And then his wife's fingers... that just shows what a sicko he is." 

"*Her fingers?*" 

"Yeah. The psychopath cut her skin off near the tip to avoid fingerprint recognition. I mean, if it hadn't been for the video surveillance I wouldn't even know who these corpses belonged to." 

I fidgeted with the ring in my finger. 
"*Can I try something?*" 

"Sure. Just be delicate,  I got funeral services coming first thing in the morning." 
I nodded and tried to slip the ring on the woman's finger.

 It didn't fit. 

Could it be that somehow, Anthony was telling the truth about this?

"*Did you check the girls?*" 

"For what?" 

"*Fingerprints.*" 

"Not sure I see the point, they would be too young to be in the database." 

I did anyway. Only to confirm strange scarring on their tips as well. 

Like they never had any prints at all. 

"Everything all right Ross?"

I slipped the ring back into my pocket, the room suddenly feeling a lot colder. "*Yeah... I probably need to get going though.*" 

I made a call to reschedule lunch with Harry and started driving toward the DA’s office. 

I had no idea at the time, but this case was going to change my whole life. And not in a good way.

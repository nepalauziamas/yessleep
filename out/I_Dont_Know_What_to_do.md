Monday, I’m Devon and I’m in a horrifying situation. It was 5 hours ago and I was walking with my friend who’s named Jacob. We were talking about how stupid our algebra teacher was being giving us so much homework. We were only mad because they were making us do work, a lot of work. We always hated school because we believed there was no reason for it as we could “learn it ourselves.”  While walking we started to realize we weren’t anywhere we recognized. We were in what seemed to be an old town and we shrugged it off and kept walking. After around 10 minutes it started to smell. It was an awful smell. It smelled like rotting 10 year old cheese. At least to me it smelled like that. 

We found an old playground and figured out that it was where the smell was coming from. I’m a very observant person and I thought I could see where it was coming from. It was a roundabout, I remember spinning the roundabout back in kindergarten and jumping on as I span for around a minute and repeated the process. I went up to it and looked around. I noticed something under it, it looked like a purplish brownish small carrot. Not an entire carrot but a small bit of it. I could tell it was not the entire thing, there was more under the roundabout. I told my friend that we would need to flip the roundabout to find out what was under it and he was unsatisfied but understood. 

We went home and around an hour ago I was still bothered by what could be under the roundabout and I felt like I was getting called to it. It was calling me somehow and I was starting to see things. Around 20 minutes ago I heard something out the window. Groans of pain and suffering. I looked out the window to see a roundabout. It was shaking and it sounded like screaming was coming from it getting louder and louder. “HELP US!” it was repeating.  It hasn’t gone away yet. I don’t know what to do.

Tuesday, This morning it was gone. The day started off by me going to school. It was mostly boring. In the hallways right as school was ending a girl walked up to me. “Hey wanna come with me after school?” I was confused. “I would but I don’t know who you are.” I responded. “But we’ll go to a playground.” I was imagining the shaking roundabout screaming for hours. “Wh-What?” I responded with “ Don’t you just love the roundabout,” they said voice starting to get deeper. “What’s wrong with the roundabout Devon? You got a problem with the roundabout Devon?” This time their voice started to deeper and distorted “The Roundabout Devon.” She started repeating over and over. I started to walk away but they were following me. I started to run and they started to run. I got in my car and drove off. When I arrived home the roundabout was back.

Wednesday, I Was going to flip that roundabout no matter what. I just can’t take it anymore. I met up with Jacob after school and he was shocked because he also had the visions and thought he was going insane. We went over to the abandoned school and since the roundabout ended up being pretty weak. We were shocked at what we saw, it was a pile of dead bodies. That was no purple carrot, it was a rotting finger. I grabbed a wallet and it said that his driver’s license expires 9/24/65. These bodies were old yet their skin hasn’t decomposed for some reason. “Is it alive?” Jacob asked.  That’s when I realized that the bodies were twitching. Bones started to snap back into place. They started moving and we ran inside the school. That’s when I started writing this. I hope someone finds this town but I can’t be too sure. I can hear something outside

I Don’t know what to do

Log 1 - Jack
  Hello you can call me jack, I work at a gas station. I’ve been working for about a year and I’ve seen some pretty weird things. I talked to the day shift guy and he told me about this sub and that some of you might believe me. 

Log 2 - The manager’s list 
 When I first started working here my manager gave me a list for if a man with red hair came to visit. when he explained that I had to follow the list perfectly, the look on his face scared me. This 40 something year old biker looked to have one of the most horrified looks I’d ever seen on a human face. It was like he could die from just upsetting this man in the slightest. I will type out what the list says here…

1- If you see a man with red hair and a lollipop please follow all instructions on this list. You may call him Cherry.

2-Cherry is aloud to smoke inside. Please don’t try to stop him.

3- When Cherry arrives he will ask for two packs of cigarettes. Please give him the two black cigarette boxes on the very bottom shelf. Do not give these packs to anyone besides Cherry.

4- There should be a box under the counter. After you have gotten the two packs of cigarettes put both the box and the cigarettes on the counter. 

5- After you put the box and cigarettes on the counter Cherry will tell you to put it on the manager’s tab. Though I do not have a tab you will tell him ok.

6- After Cherry has collected all items off the counter he will walk to the back and sit at my desk. Please do not stop him and please do not try to go into the back with him.

7- after some time Cherry will come back out without the box. Don’t ask where the box went or what was in the box.

8- Cherry is aloud to sit on the counter at anytime before or after you give him the box.


Log 3 - man of red 
 When my manager first gave me the list I thought Either he was crazy or I was going mad. But sure enough on my first night shift a man with bright red hair walked in chewing a lollipop. There wasn’t really anything off about the way he looked so I just assumed my manager just got caught up in a gang or something. But there was one thing, The man that stood on the other side of the counter was tall and well built. But his hair was a sickening bright red, The kind of red people use when warning of something. Think of a stop sign or a red light but much, much brighter. A disgustingly Neon red that made everything else around him seem dull and colorless in comparison. This had to be the Cherry my manager was talking about in his list.

I scrambled to the frigid tile floor frantically looking for the packs of cigarettes the manager mentioned. And there on the bottom shelf, two completely black cigarette boxes sit. I was surprised at first because we don’t keep anything on the bottom shelf, so it accumulates dust easily. But on this dusty bottom shelf were two perfectly pristine black boxes, no scuffs or dents in the cardboard not even the smallest amount of dust. I grab them and stand up violently making myself dizzy, but I had to get the box under the counter. I crouch down looking at the small shelf were we keep random items and the only store phone. And there just like the cigarettes, sits an almost Disgustingly perfect box with nothing signifying it had ever been handled. I put both the cigarettes and box on the counter waiting for a response from this man.

He looks at the counter and then at me. 
“Manager’s tab” he said in a surprisingly soft voice, the kind of voice you might here from an old storyteller. He grabs his items and walks into to the back shutting the large metal door behind him. I was surprised because even the manager couldn’t budge that old heavy door, but this man just closed it using one hand. In a little bit of shock I stand at the counter waiting for this mystery man to come back out. The thing is most people don’t really come during the graveyard shifts unless it’s for gas or a midnight snack, so all I had to do was wait.

Log 4 - missing box

I don’t know how long I stood there if I’m being honest, it’s just one moment I’m standing there and the next The man called Cherry walked out. The light screeching of the door being push open is what snapped me out of the trance. He walks out looking no different from when he first arrived, and he just leaves. The door rings as the man of red steps into to night, large droplets hitting his body. Windows vibrating with the heavy rain, the red of his hair like a spotlight in the gloom.
He slowly disappeared, I remember the manager’s list said he wouldn’t have the box and it was right. The small box I had given him when he arrived was no longer in his possession. Shaking slightly I step though into the back, but there’s nothing and I don’t mean like nothing important I’m saying there was literally nothing. The manager’s desk and chair in the corner of the room as always and the trash bin empty. Nothing changed or moved it looked cleaner if I’m being truthful, it looked like the guy just scrubbed the entirety of the room with industrial cleaning fluid. It didn’t make sense but I noticed I couldn’t smell anything, nothing at all. No cleaning chemicals no dusty musk nothing! I walked back out of the room just to make sure I didn’t loose my sense of smell, but that wasn’t it.  It was like he erased any proof that he was ever there, no smell, no taste in the air, nothing was there showing that Cherry had ever shown up instead of the absence of him. 

I stand back at the counter questioning if he really did ever show up. Am I going crazy!? The silence of the shop not giving me any comfort, the rain beating heavy on the thin windows. 

After working here for so long you get used to the unusual customers, the weird one’s like Cherry or the unspeakable horrors that come to get a late night drink. Again my names Jack and at the gas station I work We get some pretty strange customers.

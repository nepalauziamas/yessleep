I was expecting to walk into a building used for the SAW movies, considering the place has supposedly been abandoned for years, along with the sick fucks who owned it, but to my surprise the place looked untouched. This was somehow more worrying, it was all just way too clean, barely a speck of dust to have been seen. Granted I did come in with a plan B if those creeps were still around, also known as my dad's six shooter. I wasn’t taking any chances with this one, I was making sure they were out of this place for good…one way or the other. Damn writing it out and reading that back to myself…shit man I’m not the type of person who’s prepared to deal with the kind of shit that was in that house. 

The main floor was extremely strange to say the least. Just one big room, a single couch in the center, and a fridge + microwave in the corner. That’s it, nothing else but gross patterned wallpaper and a completely polished wood floor. I quickly checked the fridge, and to my relief, it was filled with nothing but things that long expired. An unpleasant smell to be sure, but it meant nobody’s been using it…then I started wondering why the hell the fridge would still be running. I took a deep shaky breath as I flipped the switch near the front door…to light up the whole room. Seeing the fact the place was still received power I took this as a sign I needed to get the fuck out, but curiosity is a hell of a drug, one fed on that very sign…especially when I heard movement under the floorboards beneath me.

Footsteps to be specific. Footsteps that were far too heavy to be any kind of animal. I began to shake nervously thinking about who, or what was down there, but at the same time I just needed to find out, so I began searching for the basement entry. I searched every square inch of the first flow, but couldn’t find anything. I began to tear the whole house apart until I finally found it in the attic. a long fire escape like the latter traveling all the way down to reach what looked like a brick floor. I looked down at it for a solid five minutes just debating what I was even doing here, until I remembered that letter scrawled across my window all those years ago. So with a long shaking deep breath, I traveled downwards. 

I was descending this ladder for a good while until my feet touched ground and was met with a long, narrow hallway lit up by small red flood lights. I reached back, briefly grabbing the guns grip, just to give me some sort of comfort and security before moving down the hallway, until reaching a long, extremely lit room, with tile flooring…and two robed figures kneeled over praying to a large Ivory statue of some sort of seven eyed bird demon, with the head of a beaked ram skull, two sets of large bat wings, and a long scorpion like tail. The statue looked like it had blood running down its head. At first I just stood there hidden round the corner, watching and studying the statue…until I was welcomed in.

“You certainly got bigger Seth. '' a raspy voice hissed out as the two figures praying rose to their feet, and turned to face me. they removed their hoods to reveal near living mummies of human beings, rotted even. It looked like they should’ve been buried long ago, yet they moved with no effort whatsoever, and once they stood up…I saw what the source of the blood was. A boy, no more than 13, had been laying motionless before the statue…his chest sliced half way open. “What the fuck…is that what you meant by fresh meat? fucking children, what the hell are you people?!” I shouted, reaching back and quickly drew the gun on them, and after seeing what these monsters had done, pulled the trigger with little hesitation. 

I shot them both twice in the chest, before quickly vomiting my guts up from everything that had been going on. While I was emptying my I heard laughter…along with large cracks and snaps. I began to shake as I quickly looked over to see they had brought themselves to their feet in seconds…and that the statue was breaking. “Yes, that is what we meant. The great beast prefers the purest of flesh and blood, and what’s more pure than a child, but of course…” the man began before he gestured to the statue that had completely shattered…before shedding like snake skin, as the beast spread out its wings, and let out a blood curdling scream…then turned its eyes to me. “He won’t refuse a meal when it just wanders in.” The man finished with a twisted grin before the beast charged me with extreme speed. 

I tried to evade it but the creature was too fast, and quickly pierced its long needle-like beak through my shoulder, but adrenaline is a hell of a drug, so I managed to ignore the pain for long enough to raise my gun up, before firing the last two rounds into the creature's neck. This managed to hurt the beast enough for it to drop me and let out a slight hiss of pain, and as it was recovering, those sick fucks made the worst decision of their lives, they tried to command the beast. “What are you doing, kill him and feed.” The man shouted out in a demanding tone. The beast quickly took all attention off of me, turning it to the old couple. I looked over to see the man’s face of pure horror, before quickly getting up and hauling ass back to the fire escape. 

As I ran I could hear the man’s pleas  of forgiveness from their lord, followed by the sounds of his screams, and tearing of his flesh. As fucked up as it was, I couldn’t help myself from cracking a small smile as I made my way up the ladder, down the attic, and out of the house. I debated calling the cops and reporting the dead boy but what the hell was I gonna tell them without sounding like a suspect or a nut job. Didn’t really matter much anyway considering the place burnt down in the middle of the night under mysterious circumstances…no body’s were ever found

Y’know when I was a little kid, I used to be scared shitless of Halloween. It was the masks. I didn’t like the masks. 2 year old Nina would just start fucking bawling every time a particularly scary trick or treater showed up at the door.

&#x200B;

My Dad would just get mad about it. I remember him shouting at my Mom to: *‘Shut that fucking kid up before I do!’*

&#x200B;

So she took me aside, and next time one of the trick or treaters came, she asked them to take off their mask for me, so I could see that underneath it was just some dopey kid looking for free candy. After a few kids did it, I started getting a little better about it as I began to figure out that none of the monsters were real. But that didn’t mean there wasn’t anything to be scared of.

&#x200B;

She was wrong of course. There’s still a lot of shit out there to be scared of. But whatever, I still kinda learned something that day. I learned that monsters aren’t the fucked up creatures depicted on the masks. No, those kinds of monsters don’t scare me anymore. But the people still do.

&#x200B;

I’ll bet a lot of people would look at the situation with Marco Durcovic and say: *‘Well yeah, obviously he did that. He’s a bloodsucking siren. Obviously, he’s just naturally evil.’* But at this point, I’ve met enough vampires, sirens, and other shit to know that they’re not all bad. Okay, sure. Some of them choose to be complete assholes. The rest don’t. They all make choices, just like everyone else does. They either choose to be a piece of shit, or they choose not to be. Simple as that.

&#x200B;

Honestly, if you’d told me two years ago I’d tolerate more witches and vampires than actual people, I’d have beaten the shit out of you. But hey, that’s my life now. (The key word here is tolerate. I’m not about to link hands and start singing John Fucking Lennon.)

&#x200B;

Anyways - I’d gotten the call about Marco about a week back. He’d run off with a girl's big brother (a guy named Jon who was so deep in the closet he was probably fucking half of Narnia) and she was obviously a little concerned. Before they’d vanished, she’d noticed some weird shit about her brother's new ‘friend’. Like the way her brother always looked pale and was exhausted after a night out with him, the fact that he’d been sleeping more and more, the suspicious bite marks on his arms, and the fact that his ‘friends’ teeth looked awfully sharp.

&#x200B;

So when eventually the two vanished, she suspected something was wrong. She’d called the police and the police had called my organization. I’d spent the better part of the past few days digging around looking for Marco and Jon, and it all led me to a dingy looking shithole of a hotel in Hamilton.

&#x200B;

Yeah, that was about right.

&#x200B;

I hate to say that I’ve probably done this hundreds of times now. Hell, I can probably do this shit in my sleep. I went in, talked to the receptionist and fed her some half true story about looking for a wanted criminal. I even flashed the badge the FRB gave me to look more official. Of course she was more than happy to tell me that the lovebirds were up in room 306 and give me a key. So I went on my merry way.

&#x200B;

As I made my way towards 306, I was prepared for just about anything that could be waiting for me inside. A dead body, a hungry siren or an unnecessarily close view of two strangers in the midst of a sexual embrace with horrifying implications since one of them could more or less control the other's mind.

&#x200B;

I was lucky to find none of those things when I threw open the door and even luckier to find both Jon and Marco inside.

&#x200B;

Jon was shirtless, pale and covered in what looked to be fresh bite marks. He looked like he was barely even fit to stand up. Marco on the other hand was fully dressed in a colorful hawaiian shirt that was so unfathomably ugly that if I weren’t already there to kill him, I would still be honor bound to do so on behalf of everyone with a pair of eyes. Marco jumped up to his feet in shock the moment I unceremoniously barged into his room.

&#x200B;

“Who the hell are you?” He demanded.

I didn’t really have a cool answer for that, so I just matter of factly replied with:

“I am here to break your jaw.”

Marco just stared at me as if I was completely crazy… And to be fair. I probably am.

&#x200B;

I reached into my jacket for the collapsible baton I’ve taken to carrying and saw his eyes narrow with rage. He glanced at Jon, before violently gesturing towards me.

“Get rid of her!” He snarled.

Obediently, Jon got up as if he intended to fight me, and honestly, I don’t think Marco thought this one through at all.

&#x200B;

As Jon put up his fists and shuffled towards me, I sorta just punched him in the face and broke his nose. When he didn’t fall, I grabbed him by the arm and slammed him into the wall. Now, my goal here was just to sorta get him out of my way while I went after Marco. But I either pushed him a little too hard, or the drywall was weak as shit because he went right through it. Well. It still counted as a success.

&#x200B;

Marco regarded me with concern before deciding that he wasn’t going to chance using his weird siren hypnosis ability on me. He just ran for the window. I saw him grab the alarm clock off the bedside table and hurl it through the glass. Although he wasn’t able to do much more before I crossed the room and caught up with him.

&#x200B;

I brought the baton down hard on the back of his head and forced him down onto the bedside table, before dragging him off and pushing him towards the bathroom door. It flew open when he collided with it and he collapsed onto the tile, struggling to pick himself up.

&#x200B;

“You’re on borrowed time…” He spat, “You… And the people like you. Murderers… You’re all living in your final days. Did you know that? The Militia’s going to hunt you all down… Set things back to the way they should be. The Vampire King has returned! And he-”

&#x200B;

I broke his jaw with my baton before he could say anything else. I’m a girl of my word.

&#x200B;

Marco spat blood onto the floor before aiming a kick squarely at my stomach. While I recoiled, he lunged at me, pushing me onto the bed. Maybe if his lower jaw wasn’t slanting off to one side and he still had all his teeth, he would’ve tried to bite me. But considering the fact that he no longer had a functioning jaw, that wasn’t an option. He just kept trying to run. This time he ran for the door, but I was faster. I managed to pull myself up and grab him by the collar of that stupid Hawaiian shirt of his.

&#x200B;

I dragged him back and hurled him towards the window. Marco crashed through, but he didn’t fall out. I heard him let out a gargled cry of pain as some of the broken glass embedded itself in his back. He desperately tried to pull himself up again. But running on adrenaline, I kicked him square in the stomach and sent him toppling back, out the window. I heard him scream as he went head first onto the pavement below.

&#x200B;

When I looked out the window, I was greeted by the sight of Marco Durcovic twitching on the ground. His head bent at an angle it really shouldn’t have been and there was a pool of blood starting to form around what was left of his skull.

&#x200B;

I took that as a sign that he was probably dead.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You threw him through a wall!?” Jon’s sister asked (Pretty sure her name was Kendra), “What the hell were you thinking? You could’ve killed him!”

“Oh come on! I threw him *at* a wall. Gently… Relatively gently... He’s fine! Little bedrest. A little OJ. He’ll be fine.”

Kendra just sighed and shook her head.

“Whatever… Just… Get the hell out of here.”

&#x200B;

While I was inclined to call her out on her unnecessary bitchiness, my therapist says that sometimes you should just walk away, and to be fair I could at least respect the protective Big Sister instinct. So I just shrugged my shoulders and left. As I walked out of the hospital, I checked my cell phone before placing a call to my boss. It rang a couple of times before he answered.

&#x200B;

*“Milo Durand speaking.”*

“Hey Milo. Finished dealing with that siren in Hamilton. I threw him out of a building. He may have had a victim with him, and that victims sister may be a little peeved cuz I had to rough him up when he tried to attack me, but he’s not that badly hurt. Is that kosher?”

*“Define, rough him up?”* Milo asked.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, so I broke his nose and put him through a wall.”

No point in lying about it. He’d find out eventually.

&#x200B;

Milo was silent for a moment. But I could mentally see him rubbing his temples. After a few moments, he sighed.

*“Alright… I’ll handle it. In the meanwhile, I’ve got something else for you. Just came through a couple of hours ago. It’s from Director Spencer herself.”*

&#x200B;

I paused. Director Spencer?

&#x200B;

I dunno if anyone ever wrote this down among the Cosmic Laws of the Universe, but when your bosses boss asks for you, it’s always a bad thing. It doesn’t matter what they say. It doesn’t matter how great what they say sounds. It’s always a bad thing.

&#x200B;

***Always.***

&#x200B;

I’d been working with the FRB for two years and never spoken to the Director once. Honestly, I’d sorta just assumed I never I would. I mean, she probably had better things to do than give people direct orders. I guess I was wrong about that.

&#x200B;

“What kind of job are we talking here?” I asked.

*“Something big.”* Milo replied, *“How familiar are you with the Vampire King?”*

I briefly flashed back to what Marco had been saying before I’d unceremoniously broken his jaw.

&#x200B;

“I’ve heard the name once or twice.” I said, “Couple of folks have mentioned him or the ‘Militia’ over the past couple of months. Why? Do we want him dead?”

&#x200B;

*“Us and probably a couple thousand others.”* Milo said, *“His name is Konstantinos Saragat. He’s an old one. Babylonian, we think although who’s to say. He might even predate the written record. ‘Vampire King’ is a bit of an antiquated term for him only used by his more devout followers. Not a lot of them left. But it’s come back into circulation lately. Not a good sign. We’ve gotten intel that he’s working with a group we’ve been having a lot of trouble with down south, ‘The Militia’. We suspect that Saragat’s using his influence there to build himself back into a position of power. For obvious reasons, we can’t let this happen.”*

&#x200B;

“Yeah, no shit…” I murmured, “So. Where do I start looking?”

*“Try Panama, a small town in upstate New York. Intel says he’s running blood farms out that way. The job is simple. Find Saragat. Do whatever you have to get what you can out of him about the Militia’s leader, a siren named Kayla Del Rio. Ideally where she is, or where she’ll be. Then, once you’ve gotten what you need, kill him.”*

&#x200B;

“Sounds straightforward enough,” I said.

*“On paper, yes. But be careful on this one. Saragat hasn't survived 4000 years while being that much of an asshole off sheer luck. He's got a reputation. He's like a cockroach. Elusive and hard to kill when he’s out in the open. Pull this off though, and it’ll probably make your career.”*

&#x200B;

“I can’t tell if you’ve got any faith in me or not, boss,” I said.

*“Not going to lie to you Nina… I don’t know.”* Milo said with a quiet sigh. *“One more thing… You’re not the only one after Saragat. Director Spencer mentioned another party at play here. A siren. Goes by Shelby. She’s dangerous. Not to be trusted. Spencer told me that she took out Marsh in New York the other day. You’ll be replacing him.”*

&#x200B;

I paused. Marsh had been working this? I’d worked with him before. He was one of those prissy well dressed vampires (I swear to God it's a stereotype) but he was an alright guy I guess. Also not someone I’d expect most people would be able to just ‘take out'.

&#x200B;

"She took out Marsh?" I asked.

*"He's alive. Just out of commission. If you happen to see her, do me a solid get some revenge for me, will you? Marsh’s a good soldier. I’m not happy to hear he’s out of commission.”*

"Yeah… yeah, me neither…” I said softly, “I’ll keep my eyes peeled.”

&#x200B;

*“Good… I’ll send you the rest of the intel we’ve got. Get to Panama as soon as you can. This is priority 1. And Nina… Good luck with this one. Stay safe out there.”*

“They haven’t dropped me yet.” I promised him, “See you on the other side, boss.”

With that, I hung up.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was only a three hour drive from Hamilton to Panama. A little over four hours, when you count the time it took to get back home to pack my shit.

&#x200B;

Milo had given me an address in town, along with a few pictures of the building I was looking for. The place was a dump. An old hotel owned by some shady motherfucker in New York who’d half assedly converted it into apartments.

&#x200B;

In other words, a prime location for a blood farm.

&#x200B;

I’ve only seen two blood farms during my career, and both of them turned my stomach. Some bloodsucker bought up cheap property, rented it out to people with nowhere else to go, and then when they struggled to pay the bills, the oh so generous vampire or siren in charge would let the money slide, so long as they didn’t mind getting bitten by them or their ‘friends’.

&#x200B;

The victims were kept silent by both fear, and the fact that nobody would believe them. When they eventually died, their landlord would just make the body disappear, and rent to someone else. I’d even heard rumors about some blood farm proprietors going an ‘extra mile’ with some of their female tenants…

&#x200B;

Christ, that made my skin crawl just fucking thinking about it, and I could imagine the situation all too well. I know what it’s like to be in a bad place like that. After my piece of shit Dad left, my sister and I grew up in a shithole too. And I can’t help but wonder if maybe that could’ve been us in one of those farms…

&#x200B;

Anyways, when I made it to Panama in the early hours of the morning, I thought I had a pretty good idea of what would be waiting for me. I was wrong.

&#x200B;

Instead, as I pulled onto the street, I just saw the smoldering wreckage of what used to be the building. I could smell the burning from down the street. It made me sick to my goddamn stomach. Fire trucks, police cars, and ambulances were scattered about. I could see first responders doing their thing.

&#x200B;

The fire couldn’t have been out for long. But it had clearly burned for a while before they’d been able to do anything about it. There wasn’t much left of the building but the charred and crumbling brick walls of the exterior. Just about everything else was gone. I pulled over across the street from the building and got out. I didn’t bother trying to get in with the first responders. I’ve tried that stunt before. I just got in their way. So instead I watched as they worked, staring at them as they brought out the victims.

&#x200B;

Not survivors. There were no survivors. Just victims.

&#x200B;

Maybe I should’ve known better than to look, but I just saw stretcher after stretcher brought out, the occupant always covered in a white sheet, or already in a body bag. Jesus… Some of them looked so small… Probably just kids.

&#x200B;

Fuck…

&#x200B;

This had to be Saragat. Maybe he’d known someone was coming for him, or maybe someone already had. I wondered if that siren Milo had mentioned had gotten to him first. If so, maybe she spooked him, and this was his response. Torching his own goddamn operation with everyone inside…

&#x200B;

God…

&#x200B;

I couldn’t watch the stretchers anymore. It was getting to be too much. So I made myself look away. I quietly lit myself a cigarette and ignored the voice of my Mom in my head telling me that I was supposed to be quitting. If nothing else, the cigarette helped ground me a little bit. Remind me that I was here for a reason. I pushed all the sickness in my stomach aside for later… Tried to focus on the job and not to think about the horror of what he’d done. There’d be plenty of time for that later, when I finally caught the bastard.

&#x200B;

It was probably a little fucked up how easy that was for me… See enough shit I guess, and you start getting numb. That’s not something to be proud of. It doesn’t matter what side you’re on. You lose part of your humanity anyways. I made myself focus on the work.

&#x200B;

I’d just got here and it seemed like my trail was already cold… Not a great start. But I wasn’t inclined to turn around just yet.

&#x200B;

After taking a little bit of time to piece together a plan that wasn’t complete bullshit, I figured I’d try my luck. I messed up my hair a little, brought up the picture of Shelby I’d gotten on my phone, and swung for the fences.

&#x200B;

“Oh God, Oh my God…” I sputtered as I ran right up to the police tape. As expected, one of the cops made a move to stop me.

“Ma’am, I’m afraid I can’t let you through.”

“You’ve got to! My friend was in there! Where is she? Oh God… Did she get out?”

“I’m sorry ma’am, I’m afraid I can’t help you…”

“Please, I’ve got a picture… Just look. Please!”

&#x200B;

I showed him the photo of Shelby. The cop looked at it, and frowned before shaking his head.

“I’m sorry ma’am… I haven’t. You’ll want to check with the Panama hospital. The survivors we found were sent to emerg. You’ll have to check with the staff there.”

“O-oh, okay. Where is it? I’m not from here, I was just visiting and I… I… Oh God…”

“Stay calm ma’am…” The cop put what was probably supposed to be a reassuring hand on my shoulder. It mostly just came off as creepy.

“It’s just across town. Head west, past the downtown. Turn onto Oak Street and follow it down. You’ll know it when you see it. Okay?”

&#x200B;

I nodded and wiped away my imaginary tears… I never could cry on command but I smudged my eyeliner so I’m sure that helped sell it.

“O-okay… Thank you…”

Whoever said that high school drama class was a waste of time was a moron. I looked past the cop to the skeleton of the building. I had to ask…

“How many people made it out? Do you know?”

&#x200B;

His expression darkened a little.

“Not a lot…” He said, “I hope you find your friend.”

&#x200B;

I took a parting look at the building, then headed back to my Jeep. As soon as the door was closed, I exhaled the breath I’d been holding. I still felt sick to my stomach. I tried not to look at the building before I keyed the engine and took off. Next stop… The hospital.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I probably should not have been surprised that Panama Hospital was a shithole… I mean, from what I could tell Panama wasn’t exactly a shining ideal of wealth and prosperity. I saw a lot of run down houses and abandoned buildings as I drove past. Christ, this place had probably been candyland for someone like Saragat…

&#x200B;

The hospital itself didn’t look that old, but still seemed like it’d had some rough years. I parked down the street before heading to emerg, smearing my makeup a little more to make it look like I’d been crying before making my way to the emergency room. The nurse at triage looked up at me with a fairly bored expression as I came up to her.

&#x200B;

“How can I help you?” She asked.

“I’m looking for my friend…” I said, pretending to be just holding back tears. I held up the picture of Shelby, “S-she lived in that building a few blocks away. The one that caught fire. Please, I just need to know if she’s okay… If she’s been through here…”

The triage nurse seemed to buy the act and leaned in to get a better look at the picture, eyes narrowing a little as she studied it.

&#x200B;

“Her… We might’ve. I recognize the hair. We had someone come in a couple of hours ago. Dr. Jasper was looking at her, last I saw. I’d speak to him.”

“Thank you…” I said, “Thank you so much. Where do I find him?”

“He’s still on shift I think. I’ll page him for you.”

“Thank you so much.”

&#x200B;

The nurse picked up her phone and a moment later, I heard her voice over the intercom.

*“Doctor Jasper to Triage, please. Doctor Jasper.”*

&#x200B;

I leaned against the nearby wall and took a moment to compose myself as I waited. About fifteen minutes later, a tall, broad shouldered bald man came through the doors and looked around. I figured that this was probably Dr. Jasper on account of the ID badge he wore, which read *‘Nicolas Jasper. Emergency Physician’* and had his photograph on it.

&#x200B;

“Nick, this woman’s come in looking to ID one of the new arrivals.” The nurse said.

“Oh, excellent. Please. Let’s talk in my office.” Dr. Jasper said, before hurriedly gesturing for me to follow him back into the halls of the ER.

&#x200B;

“I apologize for the delay. We’ve been busy.” He said. He sounded absolutely exhausted, “We’ve had people coming in all night. A lot of them in a bad way. You knew someone in that building, I presume?”

“A friend of mine.” I said, only really halfheartedly putting on the act, “I’ve got a picture if you could…”

“Of course, of course!” Dr. Jasper said as he ducked into a nearby office. I followed him inside and closed the door before offering him my phone.

&#x200B;

He didn’t sit down at the desk, just stood by the window and studied the picture for a moment. While he did that, I took a good look at him. He looked a little too pale. Almost sickly. Beneath his white coat, he was dressed in an expensive looking white button down shirt. His cufflinks looked like real gold and I noticed a brand name watch on his wrist. Both the watch and his cufflinks looked weathered like they’d been through a lot.

&#x200B;

Glancing at his mouth, I noticed that he had awfully long canines. They weren’t too obvious at a glance. But I’d seen plenty like them before.

&#x200B;

“You recognize her?” I asked.

Dr. Jasper nodded slowly.

“Yeah… Yeah, I do… If I recall, they found her near the fire. Out by the train tracks. No burns, but plenty of other injuries. A mugging perhaps. Not related to the fire.”

&#x200B;

I raised an eyebrow.

“She got mugged behind the building that burned down?” I asked.

“Panama can be a rough town.” Dr. Jasper said, “She’s lucky to be alive. I cleared her for release about an hour ago. She was picked up by a friend.”

&#x200B;

A friend?

&#x200B;

“Who?” I asked, “Where are they?”

“I’m afraid I can’t divulge that information.” Dr. Jasper said, “If you’re friends, you should have a means of contacting her, no?”

He stared at me and smiled. Looking into his eyes, I knew that I didn’t fool him one bit.

&#x200B;

“Yeah, funny thing about that… I lost her number.” I said.

“Then you can get it again. Is that all? Because I’ve got other patients to see to.”

&#x200B;

“Yeah… I’m sure you do…” I said quietly, “Just out of curiosity, you ever hang around that old apartment building, Doc? Recognize any of the tenants there?”

“I had a few acquaintances in that part of town, yes.” Dr. Jasper said, “But that’s really none of your business, is it?” His voice didn’t sound so friendly or professional anymore.

&#x200B;

“You ever meet the landlord?” I asked.

“No. And I have no desire to either… Most people don’t agree with the corporate policies of most resturants they dine in, but they do so anyways. Food is food.”

“Really? I would’ve thought you’d get all you needed from work.” I said.

&#x200B;

“That’s against policy.” He replied, “Now are you going to leave, or do I have to call security? Whoever you are, you should know that you’re not going to intimidate me.”

I laughed.

“Wait until you see my A game.” I said before I went for the baton in my jacket.

&#x200B;

Dr. Jasper lunged for me, grabbing me by the jacket as I brought the baton down onto his head. I felt it crack against his skull and heard him cry out in pain as he slammed me into the wall. I kneed him in the groin before swinging the baton at his head again. He seized me by the wrist and snarled with rage before violently hurling me towards the window.

&#x200B;

I have not been thrown out a window before… But I can definitely say that it fucking hurts. Thank God we were still on the first floor.

&#x200B;

I picked myself up, wobbling a bit on my feet and a little punch drunk. I scanned the area around me. It was a courtyard or garden of some kind. It was kinda kitchy, with a little fountain in the middle and way too many shrubs.

&#x200B;

Looking back, I saw Dr. Jasper climbing out the window behind me.

“Do yourself a favor and stay out of this. This is between our kind. Not yours.” He growled, “Mark my words… When your employers are done with you, they’ll turn on you without a second thought.”

&#x200B;

I just came at him with the baton again, swinging at his neck. He sidestepped me easily and leapt to the side. The fucker grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to the ground. I took a couple of kicks to the stomach before I managed to blindly swing my baton into his ribs. I heard the crack of bone and Dr. Jasper cried out in pain as he let me go. I saw him stumble away a step, a hand on his side. But before I could pick myself up again to go after him, he’d vanished, disappearing behind the hedges. I ran to follow him only to see nothing there. The fucker was hiding from me…

&#x200B;

*“Don’t make me kill you…”* I heard him say. His voice didn’t sound far off. He had to be close. *“Not here…”*

“I’m not the one hiding like a bitch.” I replied, “Where’s the siren, Doc? I’m willing to walk away if you’re willing to play ball.”

&#x200B;

*“If I told you, I’d be a dead man…”* He said, *“You ever hear what they do to their enemies? Crucifixions… Beheadings… Old world authority to keep the rowdier of us in line. You’ve got no idea what you’re up against.”*

“Not the first time I’ve heard that…” I said.

&#x200B;

My heart was racing in my chest. I heard movement nearby and tried to figure out where it was coming from. But I didn’t see a trace of Dr. Jasper anywhere. Just the empty garden…

&#x200B;

I heard the scrape of shoes on the pavement behind me and spun around. Still nothing. I kept moving, watching for movement out of the corners of my eyes. I inched closer to the fountain, hoping it might give me one angle he couldn’t approach from.

&#x200B;

*“We’ve really gotta do it this way, huh?”* Dr. Jasper asked, before giving a laugh of resignation. *“Well… Guess I can appreciate the free meal.”*

“I’m right here, Doc. Give it your best fucking shot.”

&#x200B;

From somewhere beside me, I heard the rustle of the hedges moving. Looking up, I caught a glimpse of motion as Dr. Jasper launched himself at me. I didn’t have any time to stop him.

&#x200B;

He crashed into me, sending us both to the ground. The baton slipped out of my hand as he pinned me down. He gnashed his teeth, just barely missing my throat. Thinking fast, I punched him in the ribs, aiming for the same spot I’d hit him before. He howled with pain as I forced him off of me and into the fountain.

&#x200B;

Dr. Jasper thrashed around in the waters and tried to pick himself back up again. I kicked him square in the face and sent him back down before climbing on top of his chest and forcing his head under the shallow water. He thrashed under my weight but couldn’t get me to move. As his struggles grew more frantic, I pulled his head up.

&#x200B;

“Where’s the goddamn Siren, asshole?” I snapped.

“I tell you and we’re both dead…” He gasped before I punched him and forced him back under. I let him stew for another few seconds before pulling him back up.

&#x200B;

“The Siren. *Now.*”

“You’re insane…” He sputtered.

“Yup!”

Back into the water for a few seconds, then up again. He coughed up the water he’d swallowed this time.

&#x200B;

“Saragat’ll betray you…” He rasped, “Whatever deal you’ve got, you think he’ll actually honor it?”

“What deal?” I asked, “My job is to kill that piece of shit. That Siren’s my best fucking lead. Now you’re going to tell me where she is or so help me God, I will rip out your fangs *and stuff them up your dickhole!*”

He stared at me in a mix of disbelief and horror. I made no apologies.

“You’re not with Saragat?” He finally asked, “Who then…?”

“I’m with the FRB, moron!”

&#x200B;

He blinked slowly as if processing that information.

“The Darlings have no love for your organization either…” He finally said, “Although they do seem to tolerate it.”

“The Darlings?” I asked. The name sounded familiar.

&#x200B;

“Powerful vampires… Twins… The Heads of the Imperium. They drove Saragat from power decades ago. They’re not to be trifled with. You try this approach with them, you’ll get yourself killed… Of that much, I am certain.”

“And they have the siren?” I asked, “They’re the ones that took her?”

“Mia Darling collected her personally…” He said, “Saragat’s survival is an insult to their reign. They’re probably looking for the same information you are. I don’t know where they went… But that siren was in bad shape. Not fit to travel far. There’s a penthouse in New York… If I had to guess…”

“They’re there.” I finished. I let Dr. Jasper go and stood up. He coughed and sputtered as he dragged himself out of the fountain.

“Thanks for the tip, Doc.”

Dr. Jasper managed to roll himself into a sitting position with his back against the fountain.

“You’re not going to stand a chance against them…” He warned as I picked up my dropped baton. “The Twins… They’re a different kind of vampire. They’ve been Baptized. They don’t feel pain… They don’t get tired… They don’t die… There’s nothing you can do to them. Nothing…”

He laughed a low, weary chuckle. I stared at him and considered just finishing him off before deciding that he wasn’t worth it. [I just put my baton away and left him in the dirt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/)

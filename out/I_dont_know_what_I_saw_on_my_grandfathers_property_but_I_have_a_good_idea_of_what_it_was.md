It was when I was a lot younger when I was 5-7 years old, I was staying on my grandpas property that was roughly 80 aces In Queensland, Australia. It was early in the morning in winter I’m guessing around 5-6am, 

I got up to go to the bathroom, which you had to walk out onto the patio and into a separate room not accessible from the house to use, 

I went and did my business & washed my hands and I walked out to return to bed, I looked around at the fog and surveyed my surroundings, 

as I looked around I looked towards a red couch we had on the patio, behind it I saw a humanoid thing it had greyish pale skin, around shoulder length dark greasy looking hair and it also had yellow/orange eyes, it opened its think lips and smiled showing sharp needle-like teeth, 

it looked like it had dark/dried blood down it’s chin and chest, it was skinny I could see it’s ribs and hip bones it didn’t seem to have genitalia, I was terrified and this made its smile widen, I was sleeping in a cabin not attached to the house with my little brother and my father, 

I knew I had to go back in the cabin but I was afraid to take my eyes off it, so I walked backwards down the ramp off the patio until I was far enough away I felt safe enough to turn and run, 

I opened the door and slammed it shut, I jumped into bed with my dad and went back to sleep, after everyone woke up in the morning I told my grandmother who said “it wouldn’t want to hurt you, no one would want to hurt a little girl” 

I didn’t pay attention at the time but the way she called that thing an 'it' leaves me wondering, and then I told my dad he got mad, he said “why didn’t you tell me? I could have gotten up and asked why she was on my father’s property” (I called it a lady) 

another thing to note is my grandfather’s chickens that he had in a coop that had a normal door that you opened like a door to a house, had been getting broken into and chickens were killed but not eaten, 

another thing that was going on was my Narni (Italian grandma) had been going on walks and seeing a large black dog, in the end I didn’t see it again and we went home, 

as I got older I got internet access and fell in love with horror movies and stories about Cryptids, that’s when I found the story of the Native American 'skin walker' it matched the description, 

so I brought it up to my father (we are part native) to which he replied with “don’t be stupid that was just a weird lady and you imagined the orange eyes” but I heavily believe that’s what I saw that morning.

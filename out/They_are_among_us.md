For as long as I can remember, I have heard about them. Existing among us unnoticed. Older than humanity. Living centuries. 

I first saw one of them at my home. While watching tv I saw one of them from the corner of my vision . Extremely tall and black, standing still against a wall half covered by a curtain. Immediately I told my parents but they said I was imagining things. 

I was a little kid at that time so I didnâ€™t really focus on them. But it wasnt untill a few more years later that they started to visit us.

One during a family gathering my whole family  started to talk about them. 

My uncle started by saying " I was once asleep but woke up and saw one standing on in front of the door"

He continued by saying " My friend also once told of them. He said that one day when he went for a walk before dawn he saw one of them laying down beside a tree. At least 20 foot long"

My aunt then spoke telling us of the time she had an interaction with one of them. She told" I was lying down on my bed while I heard someone trying to open a window from the outside, remembering i was several floors up I shot up and screamed a little, my husband also woke up and immediately turned the lights on.

She continued by saying " He went around investigating every window and door helping me calm dow and sleep "

My grandpa who was also there spoke " It was late at night when I head some weird sounds, so when I got up I was surprised to see a human like figure leaning Against the door beside my bed. While trying to search for a light to flash at it, it disappeared"

Adding onto that he said " After some time had passed since then, while closing the windows at night I saw the same figure crouched at a corner far away, this time managing to use the flashlight I saw It clearly. Looking like a pale old person, it kept on crouching. Deciding to ignore it, I closed the window and went to sleep"

Then my other aunt spoke telling us " A man who lives near this place also saw the same figure literally 10 or so feet close to him at 1:30 am approximately. He was scared so much he ran away to his parents who lived a few hundred meters away"  

These stories scared the crap out of me. 

But anyways, I went to school 

Then one day after a long time, probably a year or so, my Friends and I somehow started to talk about this. 

My friend told me of a weird event that happened to him and his family. 

He said " My aunt saw me or something that looked like me at the balcony and called out to me, but getting no response she came into the living room only to find me sitting there. She immediately told us what happened so we went to investigate it. Everyone who was at home at that time saw that thing. It looked like me. Suddenly it jumped to the other side of the balcony and disappeared"

He was also surprised to hear about my family's interaction that they had with them. 

But oh boy was I in for a surprise when I heard my aunts from my mothers side had even scarier interactions. 

They told me of seeing one of them dance around on a nearby rooftop in the rain at night with flowers. One of them staring directly down at my aunt while she was asleep. Seeing them sitting on trees in the forest like birds in the forest behind their house. Random balls of fire climbing up the trees.

Not only they but I as well had a scary interaction with them. 

I heard one of them walking and running around behind my house. Scratching the wall. One day even making it in and running around crazily in my home. I cannot describe how scared I was that night trying to do anything I can to fall asleep. 

After all this, I did my own in-depth research on them.

Through that research I found out that they were not the humanoid creatures only. Some having wings and some being able to turn into animals. Most liking to stay away from humans but some deliberately causing mischief to people. 

From then on my fear of them decreased though I get spooked when something suddenly falls down or (very rarely) sometimes someone knocks the door at midnight. 


Just so you know they are called Djinns and they are among us.

*March 17th, 2022*

I started hiking and backpacking with my father when I was around twelve years old. Mom passed away giving birth to me, so dad was the only parent I ever knew. He did his best to try and get me interested in things that typical little girls enjoy, but I never took to them.

During the day he worked as a store manager for an agricultural supply company, but on the nights and weekends, he worked on our small farm. He raised livestock to make additional income as well as planted a few acres of corn and tobacco. While this took up a majority of his day, he was careful to include me to make for father and daughter time.

Feeding cattle, mending fences, cutting tobacco, and running the tractors became our evening routines. Over the years, our little farm prospered and grew. Dad was able to hire some additional hands which freed him up for more leisure activity.

I can still remember our first hiking trip. Dad surprised me with a new hiking pack and a pair of boots. My eyes sparkled as he told me we would be spending the entire weekend hiking and camping on a local trail. With how hard he worked, we had never had time to take a trip of any kind that I could remember. A few scattered visits to family members in other states, but not like this.

This was an adventure.

He made me wear the boots while we worked on the farm that week to break them in. My mind raced with the possibilities. We had slept in a tent in the backyard dozens of times, but never in the woods. Thoughts of spotting wildlife, setting up camp, and the smell of eggs frying over an open fire filled every vacant moment of my day.

And that’s exactly how it went. It was magical. We spent three days hiking beside a rushing stream, sleeping under the stars, and cooking delicious meals in the beaten-up iron skilled. At that age, I even enjoyed the novelty of going to the bathroom in the woods

Over the years, my tomboyish ways softened a bit, but my love for the outdoors never faded. Dad and I went hiking or camping at least once a month until he passed away three years ago. I still go as often as I can. It makes me feel close to him. Occasionally, I find myself talking to the memory of him as I sit around the embers of my evening fire.

Last year, I started to develop an interest in ultralight backpacking. If you’re not familiar, it’s essentially long-distance hiking with the least amount of gear and weight possible. You rely on carrying extremely low-weight gear in the lowest quantity possible. If you give me something to sleep in, something to sleep under, and something to cook with, I can live in the woods for weeks at a time.

I still carry dehydrated food and a water ration with me, but otherwise, it’s the bare essentials. Three meals a day and enough water for two will get me started. The planning process always involves finding trails with available water sources. Boiling and bottling keep down on the amount I have to carry. My foraging skills are improving, but they aren’t up to a self-sustaining level quite yet.

My work as a freelance writer lets me stay out on the trails longer than a traditional job which has been a blessing. So long as I make it back to the old farmhouse five or six days a month, I can do enough work to keep the bills paid. Otherwise, you’ll find me in the forest.

I’ve been on the trail for four days now. This time, I’m planning to stay out a bit longer than usual. Typically I aim for five days, but ten is my target for this trip. I’m on a trail in the Appalachian Mountain range and heading toward a waterfall that some backpacking blogs have recommended. It should only take another day to reach, so I’ll enjoy two days there before heading back.

Time to set up camp for the evening,

So I still haven’t found the waterfall. I’ve followed the maps I printed off before heading out. The first few days, everything looked exactly as it was described, but this afternoon the directions didn’t seem to match up. I was supposed to cross a wooden footbridge earlier this afternoon, but when I reached the stream, there was no bridge to be seen.

I thought about trying to wade through but I can’t tell how deep the water is and the stream is wider than I had anticipated. Seems like a bad plan, being out here by myself. If I get swept off or bogged down, I’m in deep shit.

Cell service hasn’t been much of a help. After a few attempts to look at my whereabouts on Google Maps, I’ve given up. There is a bar of service but the loading wheel spins like a tire going down the hill and the map never loads. I wasted a lot of time by hiking back and forth on this side of the stream looking for the bridge.

Maybe it washed away. Some of those posts were from two or three years ago. The trail itself doesn’t seem to receive much maintenance either. I’ll give it another day of looking, but I’ll need to head back soon. Food will start running low and there hasn’t been much to forage or gather.

I’m bummed out, but shit happens. If I don’t find the falls this time I’ll give it another try in a month or two. I’m feeling a little winded from all of the searching today and it’s getting dark. Better set up camp.

Better days ahead,

Laurie

P.S. - Setting up camp was quicker than usual tonight. I ended up stumbling into an abandoned camping spot. At first, I thought someone was still there. After a closer inspection, it’s obvious someone left a lot of gear behind.

Two dry rotting shirts are hanging from a tree branch. A sleeping bag filled with dead leaves and animal droppings still sits by the stone fire ring.

The fire ring came in handy. I usually have to set one up myself, but someone took care of that for me. There are even enough dried logs piled up to keep me from having to gather my own, but I’m still a little irritated that someone just dumped their gear and bailed.

Stuff like that is getting more common these days. It’s a great way to mess up natural habitats. Like the world isn’t full of enough garbage.

I didn’t sleep well last night. It started to rain around 2:00 AM and I had only set up the sleeping hammock for the evening. The weather report before I sat out showed clear skies and no precipitation, so I hadn’t tied the tarp overhead. Dad wouldn’t have been that lazy. I should have listened to him.

There was a lot of noise in the woods as well. A few breaking tree branches and rustling leaves. The wind didn’t seem that bad, but I guess it was enough to cause some of the old tree boughs to give way and rattle on the forest floor.

Some of the noises sounded almost rhythmic, though. There was a hand full of times I thought I heard the distinct rustling of footsteps in the leaves and foliage, but my mind must have been playing tricks on me. I even pulled out my night vision trail came and scanned the area surrounding my camp. Didn’t see a damn thing though. Other than trees, of course.

Most of the animals in this forest bed down during the rain, anyway. Not to say something couldn’t have snuck away from its den for a midnight snack, but it wasn’t a good night to be out and about. I should know. It took me nearly a half-hour to secure the tarp over my hammock before I could get back into my waterlogged hammock.

My damn sleeping bag is still soaked. Hope it dries out before bed tonight. I’m not hopeful.

On a high note, I found the bridge today! Looks like I decided to walk in the wrong direction. I walked about a mile past the point where I had originally run into the stream and there it was. In all of its wobbly, splinter-filled glory. It wasn’t much more than some crudely nailed planks supported by some logs settled in the stream bed, but it held up for me to cross it.

I still can’t decide if I’m going to try and make it to the falls this trip or not. It’s a long way to go and I already lost a lot of time. If I don’t hit the falls my afternoon tomorrow, I’ll turn back. Don’t want to get stuck out here without any food.

Hoping for a dry night of sleep,

Laurie

What the hell is going on?

Two days ago, I turned on my phone to look through some pictures from the hike so far and it is filled with photos I had never taken. 

I’d spent another day trying to hike toward the waterfalls before I saw them.

There are more than forty pictures of me sleeping from various angles. I always sleep with the netting of the hammock zipped, but some of the pictures are of me with the zipper open. The dates on the pictures start on March 16th. Someone has been following me almost the entire time.

A video on my from last night even shows someone taking the dehydrated food from my pack and dumping them on the ground. Brown work books grind the food into the ground. You can hear them breathing like a damn marathon runner the entire time.

The last picture was the worst. Whoever took the picture was holding a hunting knife inches from my neck.

I’ve been traveling for a day and a half with no sleep. When I found the pictures I grabbed my pack and left behind my hammock and sleeping bag. I know I should have grabbed it, but I panicked and didn’t want to stick around there for another minute.

Some nutcase in the woods is following me and I’m at least three days from making it back to my car parked on the trailhead. That is if I don’t stop to rest. I told myself at first I would just walk nonstop until I got back, but I’m already exhausted. I’ve got to get some rest.

Maybe I’ve lost them.

To make matters worse, that shitty little wooden bridge was gone when I got back to the stream. I know I was in the right place because the log pilings in the stream are still poking out of the water.

I’m going to have to swim or wade across. I hope I may it. What other option do I have?

God help me,

Laurie

Crossing the stream didn’t go well.

I tried to toss my pack to the other side, but it landed two feet shy and splashed into the moving water. I couldn’t afford to lose the last bit of food I had, so I dove in and swam after it. The effort was more energy than I should have expended, but my options are running out.

It’s getting dark and I’m still at least a day away from my car. All of my clothes are wet and there is only enough food left in my pack for one more meal. I’m going to make it tonight and try to get a little bit of sleep.

My phone is still out of service and I haven’t been able to reach anyone for help. I’m afraid I’m going to die here. I’m scared. I just want to go home. I want my dad.

I think I just saw a camera flash go off in the woodline. If anyone finds this, please tell…

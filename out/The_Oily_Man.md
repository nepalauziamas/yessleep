I’ve had Snowy for about 5 years now. I fell for her the moment I saw her at the pound. Actually, I like to think that she chose me. She had walked right up to me and let me carry her, nuzzling her head into my shoulder. She was a tiny thing then, only 3 months old. I decided right on the spot that she was the dog I wanted.

I call her Snowy, but she has a glossy black coat of soft short fur. It was a silly name I played around with as a joke. It was funny to see the confusion on others’ faces whenever I called for her and she came running in her full ebony glory. But she took quickly to the name, and the name stuck. Snowy has large round caramel brown eyes that can melt your soul. She’s also a rather large and muscular dog. Yet, she walks with a lithe grace that resembles the movements of a cat. Her black tail is usually curled upwards, forming a little fibonacci spiral. 

It wasn’t curled on that day, though. It was shooting out backwards in a rigid horizontal line. Her face, usually alternating between sad puppy eyes and a bright sparkling smile, was tensed up, her lips curled back to bare her teeth. A low rumble emanated from deep within her. 

I came to a halt, and followed her gaze. There was a man in a grey hoodie on the other side of the road, with his face almost fully covered with the mask he was wearing and the hood draped low. In the dim evening light, I couldn’t make out his eyes. He was walking at a casual pace, with a slight odd gait to his steps. 

I felt a tingle of fear, but quickly brushed it off. I had heard lots of stories of dogs disliking people dressed in hoodies and who have their faces covered. Dogs apparently like to be able to read people’s expressions. I walked on, tugging lightly at the leash to guide Snowy forward. She walked ahead of me, still keeping her eyes on the man. 

When he began to cross the road over to my side, I felt myself tense up as well. I kept my face neutral and looked straight ahead, increasing my pace. Snowy began to growl louder. By the time he stepped onto the pavement right in front of us, Snowy was letting rip with full-on ferocious growls, her hackles up and her sharp canines clearly visible as she snarled. 

For a moment, I found myself lost in awe and admiration. She’s always a big softie around me, sometimes gentle and often happily excited, with a really goofy nature. I haven’t gotten to see her get truly aggressive ever. She was a terrifying sight to behold, yet beautiful and majestic at the same time. *The Hound of the Baskervilles.* The thought popped into my head. 

Then I quickly remembered the threat and poised myself to run, gripping her leash tightly in my hands. 

“Whoa, whoa!” The hooded man said, in a rather high and nasal tone. The incongruence of the threat he seemed to pose and the pitchy sound of his voice jarred me free from the stress and dread that I had been gripped in. 

He swiped his hood back off his head and took off his mask. He was just a normal guy. A normal guy with slightly rosy cheeks, a round face and eyes that blinked nervously as Snowy continued to growl. He held his arms out in front of him, trying to calm Snowy. 

“Hey, whoa, I just wanted to ask you where the nearest convenience store is. My phone’s dead and I need to buy a cable and charge it somewhere,” he said, looking warily at Snowy. 

I stared at him, still suspicious, given that Snowy was still snarling at him despite him having revealed his face. She kept herself planted between the man and I.

“Oh, I have a dog, it’s a really anxious, jumpy fellow. Your dog must be smelling it on me. Lots of dogs dislike me and my dog, I think it lets out some sort of fearful pheromone or something,” he continued.

I relaxed a little. That made sense. Snowy had often barked at a neighbour’s jittery little dog, and she often seemed to hate getting into the lift of my apartment. I had long suspected that it was due to the scent of the neighbour’s anxious dog, which probably lingered in the lift. 

*No wonder his dog’s anxious,* I thought, *any human who calls their dog, “it”...*

“Yea, sorry,” I said, “She doesn’t like the scent of anxiety, I guess.” I held on tighter to her leash, pulling her back as she tried to lunge at the man. 

“Anyway, there’s one right around that corner. Just keep going straight, turn right at the main road, and you’d see a petrol station on your right. There’s a convenience store right there,” I said, gesturing with one arm to show him the way.

“Great, thank you!” He looked nervously at Snowy, then walked away with a wave, occasionally turning back, probably to check that Snowy wasn’t lunging after him. 

Snowy quietened down when the man was completely out of sight. He must have been really scared of her. I turned my head back to look a couple of seconds after he walked off, and he was already nowhere to be seen. She seemed subdued for the rest of the walk, but perked up once we were home and I had gotten her a treat. She had been a good girl, the way she had tried to protect me.

The next day, we were back on the same path, after all, it was one of our usual routes. Lo and behold, Snowy suddenly stopped and started growling again. I looked around, half expecting to see the hoodie guy around again. But there was no one around me. 

I walked faster, feeling unnerved by Snowy’s growls. I was tempted to turn around and head home, but Snowy needed her half hour walks. Snowy’s a really energetic dog, which was something I had realised, too late, after bringing her home from the pound. She had seemed so sweet, so gentle and so placid, that I had thought she would be the perfect dog to have in an apartment. But once home, she began her zoomies, and just didn’t stop. Over the years, her energy levels are much more manageable, but she still requires at least two walks a day of half an hour of brisk walking. 

So I strode on, all braced for anything that could happen. Snowy kept growling, a low tone that vibrated into the night. We were walking by a lamppost, when I saw it. A shadow, apart from ours. It seemed to stretch from someone behind me. I froze, feeling my heart thumping and my ears begin to ring. Then I spun around, as did Snowy. 

There was no one there. I thought I had caught a glimpse of a shadow darting into the darkness, but I was probably imagining things. Or that’s what I repeatedly told myself. 

I was done with the walk. I would walk Snowy for an hour in the morning, tomorrow. Screw routine. 

I began to head back at an almost frantic pace, Snowy keeping slightly ahead of me, pulling at the leash, seemingly as eager as I was to get home. 

We were waiting for the lift when I heard footsteps. My nerves were stretched so taut, I was surprised I didn’t just rupture an artery. I stood by the lift doors, facing the source of the footsteps. The lift door opened just as I saw the tip of a shadow appear from behind the corner. 

I dashed into the lift, dragging Snowy in as she started barking and growling at whomever was around the corner. I jabbed rapidly at the “close” button, pushing aside the brief thought of, what if it was an old lady slowly making her way to the lift, and I shut the doors in her face?

Rather safe than sorry, I told myself as the doors began to close. To my relief, no one jammed a hand in at the last minute to stop the doors, like in so many movies. 

I leant back against the lift wall, breathing out a sigh of relief. Then realised that Snowy was crouched and poised to spring, baring her teeth at something on the ground. 

That’s when I saw it again. A shadow. A humanoid patch of darkness that draped itself in a corner of the lift. I felt a scream building in my lungs. By habit, I held it back. Repression, for me, is a habit that doesn’t go away even in the face of danger, it seems. I inched further back into the opposite corner of the lift. I darted my eyes about, trying to find anything that could potentially be a source of the shadow, anything that could explain why there was a shadow without a man. 

The shadow oozed forward, seeming almost like a viscous dark liquid. It grazed the ground beneath Snowy’s paws, and she leapt back, letting out a whimper. She seemed frightened. Terrified, actually. She lowered her body near the ground and hunched her body. Her tail drooped. She was still baring her teeth though, and keeping herself between the shadow and myself. 

The door finally opened, and after taking a second to steel myself, I grabbed the leash and charged out the door, past the shadow that was right by it. 

I fled down the corridors to my home, and almost dropped the keys as I tried to insert them into the lock with my shaking hands. 

Snowy seemed to psych herself back into a posture of pure aggression. She faced the direction of the lift, every muscle in her body tensed and ready to spring. I finally got the key in, unlocked and opened the door. We almost threw ourselves into the house, and I quickly closed and locked the door behind me. I flipped every switch I could find, until the house was lit in every nook and cranny in warm light. Then I flipped each switch again, to get the bright white light of the other light mode. I had a feeling I’d need the brightness.

We retreated to the bedroom, with me not even bothering to wash Snowy’s paws. I tried to huddle up with Snowy on the bed, but she sat herself firmly down in a corner of the bed, facing the door. I noticed that she kept licking her paws, and made a mental note to check them out once the threat was gone.

I grabbed the wooden katana that I had by the bedside. I know, it might seem odd why I have one right there. I was going through a combat/martial arts phase, but unfortunately, it didn’t last long. Nowadays, I just keep the wooden katana by my bed in case of break ins. I have a baseball bat by the outer door too. I really wished I had continued with the martial arts training. I should have taken up kickboxing, or Muay Thai for real. Or something, anything. Because I felt just vulnerable and exposed at that moment. 

After around twenty minutes of surveilling every inch of the apartment, I began to relax. Snowy was still tensed up with her ears pricked, but I just began to pat her in slow gentle strokes to try to calm her down. 

I headed to the toilet, and Snowy leapt off the bed to follow me there, though she seemed to be limping a little. I tried to check out her paws but she pulled them away, seeming to shrug me off as she stayed focused on standing guard. I decided to go on with my business and check them out later. I rolled the small rollie bedside table out of the way to open the toilet door. For once, I didn’t try to shut the door to keep her outside. I stared at my unnerved expression in the toilet mirror, and marvelled at how pale my lips were. Then I saw something in the reflection that finally shattered my nerves. 

The shadow cast by the rollie table had not moved, even after I had pushed it aside. 

I finally began screaming. A shrill screech tore itself involuntarily from my lungs, and Snowy went mad snapping and bellowing at the door. 

I spun around in time to see the shadow remorph itself into a humanoid shape, and glide towards the toilet’s doorway. 

Without thinking, I took two steps forward and leapt, hoping to clear the patch of shadow.

An oily hand reached out from the pool of shadow and grabbed me by the ankle. I felt flat on the ground, landing on my chest and chin, only breaking the fall slightly with my left elbow. The wind was knocked out of me, and I struggled to breathe. At the same time, I felt a sharp pain blast through my elbow. *God damn it, I probably fractured it,* I thought, before my vision blurred for a moment. 

By the time I regained my wits, Snowy was already snapping at the slimy arm connected to the hand on my ankle. She chomped down hard, her sharp teeth piercing the oiled up skin of the arm that reached up from the shadow, which seemed to glimmer with a layer of dark grease. 

The hand loosened its grip on my ankle. The arm pulled back, and Snowy’s teeth lost purchase on the oily skin.  I watched as dark putrid ooze spurted from the bite wounds on the arm. The arm retreated back to the shadow puddle, and I groggily dragged myself backward with my right elbow. 

I stared at the shadow and for a few heartbeats, nobody moved, not even Snowy, who was glaring intently at the shadow. 

Then the shadow swept forward, leaving a trail of grease on the ground, and before I could react, it had slid its way across half of my body. 

It’s hard to describe what it felt like. I’ll try, but I doubt I could capture the horror and stomach-churning disgust I felt. 

I expected it to feel cold, like how most horror creatures feel. But it was not. It was uncomfortably warm, almost hot, and the sensation of that warm oozing, greasy pile of slime that climbed across my body almost made me puke on the spot. 

The lower half of my body felt trapped, glued to the spot by the ooze. I tried to kick at it, to wriggle my way out, but I could move it. It slowly draped its way up to my chest, then to my neck, and I realised I couldn’t breathe. Which was almost a blessing, because the nearer it got, the harder the stench of rot, sewage and human waste punched me in the nostrils. I could almost taste the reeking odour in my mouth. I began to flail and scratch at it, mostly with my right arm, for any movement wrecked my left elbow with almost unbearable pain. 

I’m not ashamed to say that I lost control of my bladder right then. I felt my pants turn warm and wet, the warmth and wetness soon merging with the sludge enveloping my body. 

Snowy leapt madly about, desperately trying to save me but not knowing how. 

Then a head began to rear itself from the puddle, right above my chest, and I recognised the face of the man I had seen the night before, now gunked over with a thick black grease. Even his eye whites were covered with grease. His irises seemed to expand in size, as he stared into me, a bodiless head emerging from the shadow that was suffocating me. 

That was when Snowy sunk her teeth into his left eye socket. 

I saw her widen her jaws, lunge forward, and watched in terrified amazement as her lower canine tooth hit and dented the eyeball, before it broke through and went deep into his socket. It all seemed to happen in a really slow motion. My mouth hung open, as the black sludge sprayed from his eye socket, some hitting me on the tongue. I gagged, and retched, as much as I could without being able to take in a breath.

He screamed, a terrifying shriek that scraped my ear drums. Snowy pulled back, tearing some of the grease and flesh off his face. He continued to scream, and Snowy went in for a second attack, this time clamping her jaws on his nose and upper lip. More flesh and black blood spewed into the air as she tore back again. 

The bone chilling caterwaul he let out lingered in the air as he slunk back into a puddle, then retreated from my body. 

I could breathe again. My body felt squashed and limp, but I could move most things. 

Snowy dashed after the shadow, but it was faster. 

She returned after a while, and licked my face as I continued to lay in a sprawl on the floor. 

It was only when Snowy began to whine and whimper, that I snapped myself back into action.

She was no longer putting pressure on her front paws, and I quickly grabbed them to check them out. To my horror, I saw red blisters and open flesh wounds on her paw pads, resembling images that I had seen online of skin that had been inflicted with flesh-eating bacteria. Don’t Google it if you’re about to have dinner.

“Snowy!” I yelled, staring at the rot on her paw pads, then at her beautiful face. That was when I realised that the flesh around her cheeks and lips were also covered in sores, blisters and at parts, uncovered flesh. 

I screamed. Then dialled the ambulance. I don’t know why I did that, but I assumed no one would be asshole-ish enough to not help a dog. 

She continued to whimper, and as I dabbed at the seemingly necrotized flesh with alcohol wipes, I began to notice a painful tingle climbing from my right palm to my forearm. I finally remembered to check, and realised that the same blisters, sores and rot were forming on my hand and forearm. I choked back my scream and forced myself into an icy calmness. 

Boy, am I glad I wore long pants that night, and didn’t take off my socks. 

After finishing with cleaning up her paw pads, lips, cheeks and the insides of her mouth (which was tricky, considering she kept trying to shut her mouth when the alcohol touched the sores inside), I wiped down my right arm with my left, clenching my teeth to overcome the shooting pains from my left elbow as I tried to manoeuvre my left hand.

By the time I had carefully changed out of my sludge covered clothes without touching any of the gunk, the ambulance had arrived and we were both brought to the hospital. I think they got an actual human doctor to take a look at Snowy before a vet arrived. I’m still really grateful for how concerned and caring they were towards Snowy. 

The doctors said that there was some new strain of flesh-eating bacteria in our wounds, and they hooked us up to an IV drip with antibiotics. Or I assume the vet did the same for Snowy, for I didn’t get to see her until after I was discharged. 

No one believed my story. The police said that it was likely that someone had drugged me, and had, for reasons even they couldn’t think up, poured something containing flesh eating bacteria on us. I was hallucinating the whole thing, they said. The officer who said that, didn’t even seem to believe himself. 

I’ve been searching everywhere for any shadow that seems out of place, for any dark puddles that moved. I barely slept a wink in the hospital. When they refused to keep the ward’s lights on, I plugged in a dozen book lights, which they acquiesced to eventually. Well, to letting me keep three of them on, at least. 

I’m back home now, with Snowy, and she’s doing okay. Thank god her toe beans didn’t have to be removed. If that happened, I would probably hunt down that thing and go kamikaze on it with fire. Anyway, the antibiotics stopped the necrotizing of our flesh, and while we are both scarred, me on my right hand and forearm, Snowy on her lips, cheeks and paw pads, we both survived relatively unharmed. Screw that, flesh-eating bacteria sucks. But all in all, with me in an arm cast and Snowy with bandaged paws, we are still here to tell the tale. 

I haven’t stopped looking out for moving shadows. I’ve changed the walking route completely, and I’ve also arranged to move out of my apartment next week. I have barely slept a wink, still, despite friends staying over and keeping the lights on 24/7. 

But what really bothers me, is that today, my scars have begun to ooze a sticky, oily substance. It looks like dark grease. I checked Snowy’s scars, and found the same droplets of brackish goo. 

We’re headed to the doctor’s and the vet’s in a bit, just after I finish up with my online meetings for the day. I’m really desperately hoping that it’s nothing horrible, just some weird infection and gross pus spilling from the scars. 

The oily substance is leaking at an increased rate. My keyboard’s getting all mucked up with slime from my right hand. Snowy just skidded a little on her front paws, and she’s leaving greasy prints all over the ground. 

I think I’d better call off the rest of my meetings. I put on gloves to continue typing here, but my right glove is already bulging at the fingertips. 

Wish us luck. I think we'll need it.

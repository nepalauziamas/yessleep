Before you read anything about my account, please know that I am sorry and will be changing my ways. I'm posting this as an apology and a warning. Once I hit SUBMIT and you are all able to read my words, I will be destroying my computer and leaving for good.

I grew up a stickler for the rules. If something was made a rule, there must be a reason. This occasionally caused me issues in school but overall I was the teachers pet. Every teacher wants to their rules followed after all. If I heard about Johnny asking Tammie to let him copy her assignment I made sure to report them. If Susan was smoking on school property, I not only let the school know, but her parents and the police. 

Overall, I was a happy person. I met a wonderful partner who also shared my views on the "correct" way to do things and we were happy. At least, we were until I caught them going 1 mile over the speed limit on our way to the grocery store. I brought it to their attention, was thanked, and it didn't happen again. But soon other things started to pop up. I caught them telling a friend our Netflix password and telling their boss that they couldn't go to the mandatory teamwork retreat because we already had plans; we did NOT.

All of these instances were properly recorded and reported to those who needed to know, but together we were happy. Or so I believed until they moved out.

In my need to have control I became a monster. I didn't see it that way at the time, but I know now that I was the very definition. I spent my time on multiple websites and forums, reading and commenting. And reporting. Any and every possible infraction garnered a swift report. 

Was the post one word short of the post minimum word limit? Report.

Did the poster have a NSFW profile on a site which stated it only allowed fully SFW profiles? Report.

Someone posted a question that had already been asked 3 years prior? Report.

I was invincible because I had the rules on my side. Nothing could touch me. Or so I thought. After the last 24 hours though, I'm scared. 

I had just completed a follow-up message I would send to anyone caught breaking the rules, when there was an immediate response. 

&#x200B;

>DO YOU THINK YOU ARE ABOVE THE RULES?

&#x200B;

The audacity. I follow every rule to the letter. Even when the rule is that someone can only send in  three post reports a day, I follow it. I'll admit, to do that one I had to limit myself to only READING three posts a day, each one always had something report-worthy inside, but that is irrelevant. I follow the rules. Brushing it aside, I closed out the message and moved on to my next target, reporting a post for cross-posting. Those especially angered me; think of original content, no one wants to see the same story or photo posted multiple times. How was anyone supposed to see your history if they go to your profile and only find the same post?

Extremely satisfied with this report, I sent my follow-up message informing of the report. Immediately another response arrived.

&#x200B;

>HOW DO YOU FOLLOW A RULE YOU DON'T KNOW EXISTS?

&#x200B;

Looking to the username I confirmed these two accounts were not the same. They didn't post in the same places and appeared to have completely separate tastes. The words though gave me no pause; *how do you follow a rule you don't know exists*? That is not my issue, they should read the rules before posting.

Deciding to move on, I changed to another area. This one was always lax with their rules in general so I was especially aggravated when a poster couldn't even follow the easy rules laid out. Seriously, how hard is it to "respond to AutoMod with proof of claim"? Very easy it would appear as the very first post on my screen was in violation. "I was in the Subway when this happened", is NOT proof; reported. This time though, I didn't even have a chance to pull up the poster's profile to send the message when a notice came in informing me I had a new message myself. Checking the name it was the same as the one just reported and read:

&#x200B;

>RULE ONE: YOU MAY NOT SUBMIT MORE THAN 666 REPORTS IN ONE 189 HOUR WEEK  
>  
>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING

&#x200B;

Punishment incoming? What could that mean? And what rule are they making up? There is not a single rule written down anywhere that I have not followed to the letter. If someone was trying to scare me they would need to do a better job than this.

Standing from my computer I put the words out of my head and walked into the kitchen to make dinner. As always, I pulled out a recipe card and made sure to be exact in my measurements. I loved how the seasonings made the flavors come alive in my mouth and as long as I was exact, the taste stayed the same. Setting one timer for 24 minutes and another for 25, I walked back to my computer to wait for them to ding.

I had another message. A second line of: 

&#x200B;

>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING

&#x200B;

I began writing a response back when two things happened at the same time. One, my first timer dinged; two, there was a banging on my door followed by the words "Police! Open Up!" being shouted through my door. What on earth? Hurrying to my door I opened it to find nothing and no one. Definitely no police. I was shutting my door when my second timer went off. Running into the kitchen, I pulled the food out of the over no more than 5 seconds after the timer stopped beeping. Surely this would cause no irreparable harm?

Plating my food, it looked and smelled fine; delicious even. 

A new message was on my screen when I sat back at my desk.

&#x200B;

>RULE TWENTY-FOUR: IF FOLLOWING ALL RULES, A FIVE MINUTE TIMER BUFFER, AND SIX INGREDIANT BUFFER MAY BE PROVIDED TO ALL MEALS CREATED. BREAKING A RULE REMOVES THIS BUFFER.  
>  
>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING

&#x200B;

Why was someone doing this to me? There is no such rule that I've ever seen. How would it even work? It makes no sense. So I took a bite of my delicious food. I tasted like the foulest thing imaginable. I choked and gagged at the flavor. The texture was also wrong; it felt as though something were moving inside my mouth. Running to the trash can I spit my mouthful out. Nothing, it appeared normal. Another bite was tried and this time, if possible, the taste was even worse. As I spit the bite out it felt as though mini razors were slicing into my skin. I spit out blood on top of the normal looking food.

Resigned to going to sleep hungry, I dumped the remaining food in the garbage, washed and put away my dishes and began my night time routine. While I was in the middle of flossing I swore I saw something out of the corner of my eye in the mirror. Startled, I turned around and looked everywhere. Whether inside my bathroom or throughout the rest of my house I saw nothing and no one suspicious. Giving up I climbed into bed and quickly fell asleep.

Morning came with the sounding of my alarm in my ear. I attempted to turn over to silene the sound but found I was unable to do so. I made to sit up but couldn't do that either. I was immobile, stuck in place with nothing visible holding me down. My alarm continued to sound. Minutes turned to almost an hour when the feeling abruptly vanished. I could move again, I could turn off my alarm, I could get out of bed.

I was going to be late.

My heart raced as I saw the time ticking by while I moved as fast as I could to complete my daily routine. The timing of the steps ran around my head again and again. Fifteen minutes for getting dressed, fifteen minutes for making and eating breakfast, three minutes to walk to my car, twenty-six minutes to drive to the office, eight minutes to reach my desk. I always arrived early and prepared buffer time for the unexpected. I was due at the office in exactly one hour. 

I was going to be late.

I obeyed all social conventions and did not run to or from my car. I obeyed all traffic laws and did not speed, nor did I rush any lights or stop signs. I followed the rules. I was seven minutes late. This had never happened to me before and I didn't know what to expect. People would whisper. My boss would fire me. I was going to be homeless. Thoughts and feelings rushed through my mind as I tried and failed to process my work load that day. Each step in my direction felt like my doom. Seconds ticked by into minutes though, and those minutes eventually became hours.

Time to leave. No one had said anything. Did I get away with it? Do I turn myself in? I was a whole seven minutes late. Nothing.

Back home I tried my best to shake off the day and move forward. I needed control. I needed to put things back in order. Everything would be better if only.... If only.

No surprise, the moment I loaded my computer, multiple messages were flashing:

>RULE SIXTY-THREE: ALWAYS COMPLETE YOUR ORAL HYGIENE ROUTINE IN FULL BEFORE CHECKING AREA FOR INTRUDERS  
>  
>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>RULE NINETEEN: IF RULES ARE FAILED THE PREVIOUS EVENING SET YOUR ALARM FOR THREE HOURS PRIOR TO YOUR NORMAL WAKE-UP TIME  
>  
>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

>RULE FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-ONE: ARRIVE TO WORK ON TIME, EVEN IF PREVIOUS RULES HAVE BEEN BROKEN. IF MORE THAN THREE MINUTES HAVE PASSED BEYOND YOUR STATED WORK START TIME, AND ANOTHER RULE HAS ALSO BEEN BROKEN THE SAME DAY, SPILL A CUP OF COFFEE ON YOUR SHIRT BEFORE ENTERING THE BUILDING.  
>  
>PUNISHMENT: INCOMING

What are these rules and who keeps sending them. It's only been 24 hours but I feel like my life is spiraling out of control. I tried to push it out of my mind but ANYTHING I did this entire evening would cause an immediate message to appear on my screen. A "rule" had been broken and punishment was "incoming".

At my wits-end I messaged one back asking for help:

&#x200B;

>*Please! What do I need to do? I don't know where these rules are coming from. Help me! Please...*

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to expect but I actually got a response back immediately:

&#x200B;

>TELL YOUR STORY. DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER. LEAVE US ALONE.

&#x200B;

I asked for clarification but only received the same response repeated over and over again. *"Tell my story*?"

My cell rang but when I picked it up the screen was still dark. Putting it back on the desk made my sound system turn on, the song "How Do You Sleep At Night" by John Lennon coming through my speakers. I pulled the plug, silencing the music only to have my overhead light begin to cut off and on. Something was going on and it terrified me.

"Fine," I shouted to air, feeling like a crazy person. "I'll do it. I'll tell my tale and never touch another computer again. Okay?"

The flickering immediately stopped. A blank word document appeared on my screen, the cursor flashing. I can do this, I thought, and began to write...

I honestly don't know what to do from here. I have a cabin up north I've never been to and sensible savings set aside. I just want it to end so I can go back to my rule-abiding life. I'll say anything they want so they leave me alone. Hopefully, this works.

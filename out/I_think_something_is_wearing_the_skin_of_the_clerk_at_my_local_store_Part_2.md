[I was hearing fire alarms and people shouting as I walked off](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wzet33/i_think_something_is_wearing_the_skin_of_the/) into the night with only my wallet and my phone. I checked the wallet and the business card Mr Grayson gave me was still there. I didn’t want to call him on my phone so I walked a few streets until I found a public one and made the call there. It was pretty late but someone did pick up.

“Hello, is this Mr Grayson?” I asked.

“Yes, that is in fact me. May I ask who I’m talking to?” he asked from the other end in that deep raspy voice.

“I’m that guy you met at a bar last week. Or was it two weeks ago I don’t remember anymore.” I told him.

“Oh, it’s you, huh?” he asked. “What are you calling me so late for?”

“I killed my girlfriend.” I responded. There was silence after this.

“What?” he asked in a quieter tone.

“Yeah, I slit her throat and set the apartment on fire, she’s dead for sure.” I explained to him.

“What the fuck did you do that for?” Mr Grayson asked in a baffled tone. “Was she one of those things?”

“I… thought she was, in the moment at least, but now I’m not really sure anymore.” I said, realization kind of washing over me now that I was saying it out loud.

“Jesus fuck… Shit, meet me outside of Siegal bar in like 15 minutes, we’ll talk more there.” he said and closed the phone.

I did as he told me and a little while later a black car showed up and honked at me. I walked up to the driver’s window to see Mr Grayson there, still wearing his sunglasses even late at night.

“Take off your sunglasses.” I told him. He sighed in annoyance and lowered them so I could see his eyes.

“See, it’s me. Now get in.” he said.

Once in the car he started driving around I began explaining to him. Not just what happened with my girlfriend, but the entire thing and how it started with meeting Jeremy.

“So are you sure your girlfriend was actually one of those things?” he asked after I told him all that.

“I don’t know, I was sure she was one, but now I’m like, 80% sure she was. I really don’t know, man.” I explained to him. He nodded.

“You should have called me, but it’s fine.” he sighed.

He drove in silence for about 15 minutes before stopping in front of a cheap motel next to a red pickup truck. He pulled out his wallet and handed me 50 dollars.

“Stay here until this blows over, I’ll call you to update you. Try to not leave this place until absolutely necessary.” he explained.

“And what are you going to do?” I asked him.

“I’ll look into this ‘Jeremy’ guy then we’ll figure out what to do next.” he told me.

“And what about my girlfriend?” I asked him. He sighed heavily again.

“One thing at a time, we’ll figure something out, don’t worry.” he said. “Next time if you see one of those things, call me first, please.”

We shook hands and he wished me luck. I did as he asked and I booked a room for the motel. It was a miserable dirty place, but it was also incredibly cheap.

I stayed there for a week, and then another, not leaving at all. Those days are such a blur, I had so many thoughts and emotions running through my mind. Was that really a monster that I’d killed? If so, what had happened with my real girlfriend? How many more of those things were there? Did Mr Grayson actually have my best interests in mind? There was barely any sleep in those weeks.

I just sat there in the dark, my windows covered up. Every single tapping noise or footsteps I’d heard outside my room sent me into a panic. One thing I remember was watching the tv a lot to hear about the incident at the apartment, I expected it to be viewed as a brutal murder and that I’d be wanted by the cops. There was absolutely nothing about it. I looked it up online too. There wasn’t a single article about it.

I knew something was wrong, well, more than it already was. My city had a low crime rate so such a violent murder as that one would have surely been big news.

I waited for another week, still no news from Mr Grayson, still nothing on the tv. I was growing restless so I decided to do some more investigating, as if that hadn’t gotten me into so much trouble already.

I walked back all the way back to her apartment building early in the morning. I expected to get some weird looks coming back there but none of the residents seemed to pay me any mind. I walked to her apartment, the door was intact, not even any signs of soot. When I tried pushing it open I found out it was locked. I hadn’t locked it, I thought maybe the police did.

I looked around some more until I noticed a janitor was cleaning the hallway and I decided to ask him about it.

“Hey, do you know if a woman called Sarah lives here?” I asked him, pointing to the door. The man looked at me without raising the visor from his cap.

“Sarah?” he asked me back and I nodded. “She’s on vacation right now.”

“Really?” I asked him and he nodded back, visor on his cap still not revealing his eyes. “When did she tell you this, I hadn't heard about it.”

“About a month ago.” he mumbled, uninterested.

“Was this before or after the fire?” I asked him and this seemed to stop him in his tracks for just a second.

“What fire?” he asked. There was just the slightest hint of a smirk on his face. I believe there was a common unspoken understanding between me and that thing there. I left without asking him any more questions.

Over the next two weeks I tried getting in contact with Mr Grayson again but he wouldn’t pick up his phone. I even tried messaging him on that forum again but it said his account was deactivated. Once again, I don’t really remember much of what happened during that time period, it was just a blur of negativity and confusion. I was just waiting for something to save me from this entire situation.

I started watching the TV a lot more to distract myself, but that only made it worse. The thing is, once you realize these things exist you just start seeing them everywhere. Always somewhere in the back during a news report, lost in a crowd somewhere.I started doubting Mr Grayson’s theory that it was only 1% of the world population, how could there be so many of these things? Now most of them I couldn’t confirm, but you just know for a fact it’s one of those things when you see them, I could tell. I knew. It was driving me insane knowing.

I’d had enough, I had to get out of there. I didn’t know where I’d go, but I just could not be in that city anymore. Just the day that I was making preparations to leave I got a phonecall from a familiar number.

“Hey, kid, it’s me, Mr Grayson.” the raspy voice said. Too raspy. “Listen, there’s been a development in this case, I think we need to meet up to discuss what to do next.”

“How do you have my number? I never called you from my mobile phone.” I told him. That didn’t seem to cause him to even miss a beat though.

“Christ, I’m with the government, kid, you think we can’t figure something like that out?” he asked in an annoyed tone. I had to give this thing credit, it was doing a great Mr Grayson impression. Of course it was pointless because if he actually was Mr Grayson he would have known where I’m at.

“Meet up where?” I asked, trying to play along, see what it wants.

“You choose, but we have to meet today, it’s important.” the thing pretending to be Mr Grayson said.

“How does the center of town sound?” I asked the thing, interested to see if it was going to meet me in such an open location.

“Sure, I’ll drive over there right now. I’ll park on Gein street. Looking forward to seeing you, kid.” it said and closed the phone abruptly.

I decided to meet it. I was going to leave town afterwards, but I wanted to see what it wanted first. I should’ve just left right there and then, but I just had to know. After so much suffering and confusion, I had to.

It was a relatively short walk. The entire time I tried to not look at many people if I could help it, I knew that I’d feel sick instantly if I saw one of those things. Even then, I still felt their eyes on me. Mr Grayson’s car was parked where the thing said it would be and the thing pretending to be him was in the car. He motioned over for me to come up to the window, which I did.

“Listen, kid,” the thing started in that condescending tone Mr Grayson had, “I’ve looked into this entire thing deeper and I think you’ve overblown it out of proportions. That Jeremy kid you told me about, he’s not one of those things, he just has some neurological disease or something. You can go ask him yourself to see, you wasted my time with that goose chase.”

I didn’t even respond to anything he just said, I just stared at him, hatred seething through my body as I watched this thing blatantly lie to me. I let him continue to see what other things it would conjure.

“Your girlfriend, she’s not one of those things either. She thinks you’re having some sort of mental breakdown right now and honestly, I think I believe her. This entire thing seems to have taken a toll on you kid, I just don’t think you’re cut out for it. Just hand me back my business card, go home and forget about this entire thing.” it explained as I had to try my hardest to hold back laughter.

“My girlfriend is dead.” I reminded the thing. Once again, it didn’t miss a beat.

“No she’s not, I talked to her just this morning. I can drive you to her apartment right now to meet her. '' It said, trying very hard to convince me of this.

“How could you have talked to my girlfriend when I murdered her?” I remind it once again. It just wouldn’t accept it.

“That’s another thing you imagined, like the guy at the baseball game or Jeremy walking up that building or whatever the fuck you told me happened. Your girlfriend told me you suffer from psychosis, I think that’s what might have caused this entire thing.” it continued lying to me. The confidence with which it lied to me just made me hate it so much more.

It would’ve been pointless to argue with this thing, it would’ve just continued claiming I was insane. Hell, it might have even convinced me eventually, the last couple of months of my life were just a blur in my mind after all. But there was one thing. While it did do an almost perfect impression of Mr Grayson, there was one thing it couldn’t actually mimic.

“Take off your sunglasses.” I told it. I could see the thing instantly freeze up when confronted with something it couldn’t fake.

“What?” the thing asked, confused.

I simply turned around and walked away from the car afterwards. I heard it calling me to come back and when I heard the door of the car open I started sprinting away.

I walked fast all the way back to my shitty motel room to pick up some stuff before leaving town but when I got there I noticed a red pickup truck parked right outside my room. There was a tall man with long dirty blonde hair peering into my window, shoulders slouched. The tapping noises, that’s what had caused it. I decided that what was in that room wasn't important anymore and turned around and left.

I had a walk through the city aimlessly for a bit, thousands of thoughts running through my mind, wondering what to do next. I had to get out of the city, but how? A bus would’ve been my best option, the one out of town left in a few hours. I had to kill some time and you wouldn’t believe how slow time passes when you are as stressed as I was.

I don’t know how much of this was paranoia but I couldn’t shake the feeling of eyes on me. A burning inhuman hatred being directed at me from several directions every time I was near a crowd of people. I didn’t have the mental energy to check to see how many of those things were surrounding me at any given time.

I decided to sit down on a bench on the side of the road to relax for a bit but there it was, but just a few minutes afterwards a red pickup truck stopped right in front of me. Same long blonde haired guy was inside of it, just sitting there. I got up and sprinted away. I was so exhausted by the entire thing.

After some more walking, by chance, I ended up at Siegel bar again. I figured that I might as well be somewhere inside. Even if there was more of those things there at least the bar was dimly lit enough that I wouldn’t know and that was better. I sat there at a table near the back, catching my breath, my head in my hands. The red haired waitress with bangs walked up to me to take my order. She returned with a mug of beer a few minutes later.

“Wi-ll there be anything else, sir?” she said. I looked up at her when she said that. I realized why I thought her bangs looked weird, because they covered her eyes. Of course those things knew everything, they’d listened to the entire conversation me and Mr Grayson had about them. Who knows for long they’d been monitoring me?

The thing pretending to be the waitress smiled at me. There was such a sense of smug self satisfaction on its face. It knew that I knew. I looked around the dimly lit room for a bit. There were about 4 to 5 of those things that I could see that had been staring at me the entire time and I just hadn’t noticed because I was so lost in my thoughts. They all knew that I knew.

“Are you alright, sir?” the thing pretending to be the waitress asked. It was mocking me. These weren’t just dumb parasites with an animalistic drive to survive, these were intelligent creatures that seemed to take great joy in fucking with me. I’d had enough.

I picked up the beer mug off the table and slammed it in the waitress’ face, shards of glass and blood flying everywhere as it shattered. It cut my hand pretty badly too but I didn’t care. I ran out of the bar as fast I could and then I just kept running until I eventually just collapsed onto my knees on some random street.

As I kneeled down on the pavement trying to catch my breath a car pulled up right next to me. It was a red pickup truck. The thing inside just looked at me through the driver’s window, not even moving.

“What the fuck do you want?!” I shouted, getting up from the ground to walk towards it. It didn’t say anything, it just continued staring at me from behind that dirty blonde hair.

I opened the door of the car and yanked the thing out. It felt like I was pulling out a scarecrow. It fell to the ground and I stomped on its head a couple of times in anger but it didn’t even bother trying to fight back. Instead it propped itself into a sitting position and continued staring at me.

“Fuck you.” I told it as I got in its car and drove off. It was still there sitting down as I looked in the rearview window.

The entire situation just kept getting worse and worse, I felt like I was going insane. I was going to drive out of town and then just keep driving until I ran out of gas and then I would never think about what happened here ever again. My phone rang a couple of times, Mr Grayson’s number, I didn’t bother picking it up.

“We got a special dedication up next,” the voice on the radio said, “it’s dedicated to the guy in the red pickup truck currently driving on Sawyer street. Good luck, buddy.”

I instantly stopped the car, almost causing an accident, and got out of it as Every Breath You Take by the Police started playing. I left it on the side of the road and decided that I was gonna wait for the bus out of town at the station. It was only about 20 minutes or so away anyway. I probably should have been more freaked out by what had just transpired but at that point I’d been through so much already that it barely phased me.

I sat down on the bench in the bus station, waiting for the bus to show up and free me. It was dark and quiet outside, which normally would be scary but in this situation I welcomed not being near anyone. The silence was cut short by my phone buzzing with a message. It was a message from my girlfriend.

“Hey, where are you? It’s getting pretty late, I’m concerned about you.” the message read. I chuckled out loud when I read it. A few minutes later another message. And then another. When I got a phone call from her number I just threw the phone in a trash can. To be honest, I was just scared of hearing her voice, especially knowing it wasn’t her voice. It couldn’t be her voice, I killed her, I remembered it crystal clear.

I dropped to my knees and cried for a bit in the station after that. Then I laughed for a bit at the absurdity of the situation. Then I cried again some more. Something about that just broke me mentally. I sat on my knees some more, no bus showed up, the phone continued to ring from the trash can. The bus never showed up. I wanted to just give up right there and then, but I couldn’t, right? I couldn’t let those fucking things win, I knew I wasn’t crazy. I don’t know if it was conviction or just pathetic desperation and nothing else, but I got up.

I don’t remember the next couple of days. I remember that I decided to leave through the outskirts of the town through the wilderness, but I don’t remember anything that happened for a while after that, I think I was just broken mentally.

What I do remember is being handcuffed by a pair of cops on the side of a highway around a week later, covered in dirt and bleeding. I remember that I didn't even struggle. I remember spitting in the officer’s face as he was reading down my rights which led to them kicking me while I was on the ground for a bit. I couldn’t care less, I was completely lethargic by that point. I remember the arrest took place next to a red pickup truck.

“Are you arresting me for killing my girlfriend?” I asked the officer driving the car.

“Your girlfriend’s fine, she’s the one that reported you missing.” he told me. I don’t think he was lying, it was probably what he genuinely believed.

“My girlfriend’s dead, that’s a thing wearing her skin that told you that.” I told him, knowing full well he wouldn’t believe me.

“You’ve completely lost your mind, haven’t you?” the officer asked me in a condescending tone.

“Your colleague next to you is one of those things too, you can tell because he hasn’t taken his sunglasses off. That’s the window to the soul. “ I said, more talking to myself than anything. The officer laughed.

“Is that right, Richard? Are you actually a skin stealing monster?” the officer asked mockingly.

“Yep.” the thing wearing Richard’s skin responded. They both laughed. I laughed too.

I spent a few months in a mental hospital afterwards. I listened to countless doctors tell me how apparently I’d been diagnosed with psychosis my entire life and I hadn’t taken my medication in a few months. Of course, none of that had ever happened, I’d never even taken a psychological exam in my life before, but it’s what my patient sheet said so I agreed with it.

I agreed with everything the doctors told me. None of those things existed, my girlfriend had been alive the entire time, no Mr Grayson had ever existed, I just nodded my head and smiled the entire time. When they eventually decided that I wasn’t a danger to myself or other people they released me.

I was picked up by “my girlfriend Sarah” and eventually moved back into my apartment with her and started back on my graphics design job. That’s how my life has been since then, it’s returned to a superficial sense of normalcy.

Now, let’s get one thing perfectly clear. I’m not crazy. I did kill my girlfriend. I know that this thing that lives with me is just something wearing her skin, but I ignore it. I ignore the feeling of burning hatred that I can feel come from the eyes hidden behind her hair. I ignore it when she sits in the corner of the room at night staring into nothingness, when she convulses on the couch or the fact that she hasn’t spoken one word to me since I met her again. I don’t care enough to do anything about it.

The things haven’t gone away either, if anything they’ve become even more aggressive now with their expansion. I would say around half of the neighborhood is one of those things now if I had to guess. There’s a kid with hair over his eyes that sits outside in front of my apartment block all day. The old lady downstairs that sits with her face pressed against the window for hours at a time. The other day I saw the mailman bend his body so he could crawl around a pipe on the side of the building. I just ignore all of it.

Sometimes when I'm out walking I'll see Mr Grayson, or the thing wearing his skin, down at a bar or something. It smiles at me every time it sees me.

This morning I woke up and walked into the living room, my girlfriend sitting in the corner of the room, staring into nothingness again. I sighed.

“I’m going to the store, need anything?” I asked my girlfriend Sarah. Her body just convulsed wildly. I think that was a no.

It was around 7 in the morning so it was early enough for what I had in mind. I walked to the store where this entire thing started, it felt like a lifetime ago by then. Jeremy was at the counter, still slouched over and breathing heavily. His long greasy black hair down to his shoulders by now, sweaty from the summer heat and stuck to his face and neck like black tentacles.

I put a bottle of coke on the counter, but that’s not why I was there, and he seemed to know too because slightly raised his head to get a better look at me. He nodded as if to acknowledge my presence.

“You know that I know what you are, right?” I asked. Jeremy nodded his head in that disgusting inhuman fashion.

“...So?” Jeremy muttered in that voice that almost sounded human but not quite.

I shrugged. I laughed. Jeremy smiled at me with a snake like smile. I laughed some more. I don’t know what was so funny to me, but I couldn’t really stop laughing. He was right. So what? I’m surrounded by skin stealing monsters, I know this, and I can’t do anything about it. It was so funny, so absurd. It’s like I’m an insect struggling inside the mouth of a venus fly trap.

I laughed all the way back home. I laughed as I entered my apartment, my girlfriend Sarah still shaking in the corner of the room. I laughed as I sat down on the couch and turned on the television and watched the president give a speech, his shoulders slouched, hair over his eyes.

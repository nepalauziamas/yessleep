I remember slipping my in and out of consciousness momentarily. For a minute, I forgot why I was there or what was happening.

I felt a raw, intense pain as though someone were using my nerves as strings on an instrument.

My lower half felt like it was going numb and I was slipping out of consciousness again.

I looked down to see her pale, white face feeding on my intestines.

She stopped for a moment to look back at me. I trembled as I began to remember.

It started that evening, as I was wrapping up my chores and getting ready to relax before bed.

I sat down in front of the TV and began flipping through channels before remembering to clean up the kitchen.

I began washing up the dishes before sealing the leftover meat into a concealed container and placing it in the freezer. It goes bad so quickly.

I paused for a moment to listen. After a few brief seconds, I decided to scan around my kitchen. I was alone tonight, but something unnerved me. I couldn’t shake the feeling that something was right beside me always.

I attempted to shrug it off and get back to cleaning.

I took extra special care to wipe down the meat tenderizer and bread knife.

It seems silly to use a bread knife on a roast, but it’s serrated teeth really help cut through those tough cuts of meat.

I finished cleaning up and went back to my programs.

After a while I felt myself starting to nod off. 

I checked the time. It was 10:30 to the minute. I decided to call it a night as I reached for the remote.

As the television went black, I saw a white reflection beside me. My heart raced as the room went dark.

I was too afraid to turn, but I could still see it in the reflection.

I took a second to compose myself.

I turned my head only to find a open space next to me. I turned back to reflection, thinking it was just a trick of the light, but it was gone.

I had a lot of trouble getting to sleep that night. I couldn’t shake the sound of bare feet walking past my door. 

Eventually I decided to get up for a glass of milk. 

Walking past my laundry room, I decided to check on my clothes. It was a bit last minute, but they needed washing and couldn’t wait until next week.

“Damn” I said as I realized the stains were still there. Some are just too thick to wash out.

There again, I felt the presence. I could hear the footsteps behind me approaching.

I tossed my top back in the washer and closed the door in hopes it didn’t spot the light.

The footsteps crept closer as my heart raced. All I could do was listen as the nightmare grew closer, hoping it would pass me by.

As the footsteps rounded past the laundry room, I felt a sense of ease for a moment. A sigh of relief fell over me. As I turned around, I was stopped in my tracks.

There it was stood in front of me. It’s gaunt figure, grotesque and bloated. It’s pale face, lifeless and frail. The long thins clumps of hair protruding from its scalp.

That’s all I can remember of how I got in this mess. 

I feel as though I’m paralyzed and unable to fight back as if there was anything left to fight for. 

I began slipping out of consciousness again.

I woke up the next morning on my laundry room floor. I immediately panicked, reaching for my stomach, only to find, that I was untouched. I’m not stupid enough to think this was all just a dream. It was an omen.

I raced out to the back to find everything in place. The grass was untouched and the soil was in tacked.

I waited until nightfall, sure it would come back for me, but it was my only opportunity. I waited patiently by the back door. I felt it’s presence moving behind me.

As the neighbors porch light finally dimmed, I made my move with a shovel in hand. I had to know if this was a specter that was haunting me or something else entirely.

I began digging into the thick, hard soil. Clump after clump of dirt, I could feel it’s presence growing more hostile. 

Eventually I hit the thick plastic bag underneath.

Hoping to find the decomposing body, to my horror, the bag was empty.

I had my answer…

I turned to find it perched on all fours, it’s limbs contorted out of shape. I closed my eyes and sighed one last time.

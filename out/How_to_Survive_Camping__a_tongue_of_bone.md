I run a private campground.  It’s been in the family for years, even if that family currently is just me, my brother, my sister-in-law, and their [changeling baby](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mn7puv/how_to_survive_camping_my_niece_is_not_my_niece/).  Okay, sure, there’s quite a lot of extended family members, but they’re content to not get involved and let me do all the hard work.  And believe me, there’s a lot of work to be done right now.

Like cleaning up what’s left behind by rule #11.

If you are wandering the campsite with friends and you discover that one has gone missing, contact camp staff immediately. Under no circumstances should you try to find them yourselves, not even if you discover that they’re only a short distance away. That might not actually be your friend.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

Mattias wrote in his journal that he “became close” to the inhuman.  It was all a matter of exposure.  The more time he spent in the woods, trailing these creatures that aren’t human, the more he came to understand how our realities intersect.  There is, of course, a downside.  I am not talking about how dangerous it is, to constantly put yourself in proximity of things that prey on humanity.  That is a given.  Rather, the more aware you grow of the inhuman things, the more aware they are of you.

And I guess that means that Beau now decides to drop by whenever he feels like, even if I’d really, really rather he not.

It's rather alarming to start your day with a face pressed to the window, especially when it's being held by Beau and you're not sure where he got it from.  The flayed skin was stretched across the glass in the kitchen, the features distorted obscenely.  The empty mouth was pulled into a scream and I could see Beau’s hoodie through the oblong eye sockets.  Beau stared in at me, both hands pressed against the glass to stretch the skinned face out to its maximum effect.

“I’m… making coffee,” I finally said.  “You can come inside if you like.”

Anything to get that horrid thing off my window.  Unfortunately, my relief was short-lived, for when he came inside he tossed it onto the kitchen table, inches from my bowl of cereal.  I deliberately moved to a different chair, taking the bowl with me, and I set the cereal box so that it blocked my view of the face.

“Why do you have a human face?” I asked.

"Oh, this is just one I had lying around," he said dismissively.

I’m not really sure if that’s a Beau thing to do because honestly, I feel like I don’t know him that well even after all this time.  It’s not like he’s one to make chitchat about his hobbies and the likes, not when interaction with humanity physically pains him.

I resolutely finished my breakfast and he watched me the entire time.  I’d be damned if I let him interrupt my morning routine.  Sometimes it feels like that’s the only stability I’ve got left in my life.  My niece is a changeling, my best employee went to go be a seal forever, and my land is turning ancient.  I deserve a quiet cup of coffee and a bowl of cheerios in the morning.

“Okay, so *why* did you bring me a face?” I sighed once the dishes were put away.

“This is how you get rid of the harvesters,” he said with uncharacteristic patience.

If you just mentally went ‘wat’, you’re not alone.  Except I didn’t say it in my head, I said it outloud.

“You give them what they want,” he elaborated.

“I thought you said you’re on good terms with them.”

I slowly sat back down at the kitchen table and moved the cereal box so I could stare at the face.  It was hard to tell anything about who it had once been, laying flat on the table, but I thought perhaps it had once belonged to a man.  Middle-aged, judging by the wrinkles.  Or perhaps that’s just how skin looks once it’s been removed from a face.  Wrinkly.  I don’t know.

“This won’t kill them,” Beau said dismissively.  “It’ll just make them… not a harvester anymore.”

His words came with a little difficulty, as if he didn’t know quite how to describe the concept.

“And what will they become instead?”

“I honestly don’t know.  It’s not like anyone has done this before.  But they’ll stop harvesting body parts, at least.  Isn’t that what you want?”

“Not if it turns them into something worse,” I muttered.  “Did you bring this… for me?”

“No.”  He frowned in annoyance and snatched the skin back, tucking it into a back pocket.  “This is mine.  You have to get your own.”

So Beau carries a skinned face around like a handkerchief, this is something you know now.

The worst part is, I don’t recall finding a body with just the face removed at any point.  I feel like that is something I would remember.  I’m not sure what Beau did with the person while they were dying or after they were dead and frankly, I don’t want to find out.

"There's six of the harvesters right now,” he continued.  “You can't think of six people you dislike enough to cut their face off? I'm disappointed, Kate."

I told him that I could certainly come up with six people - I mean, the town is *right there* \- but I’d already made a lot of progress at being a less murderous person and I figured I might as well keep at it.  I then tried to ask him why he was bringing this up *now.*  I haven’t liked the harvesters for some time.  I haven’t tried to hide that, either.  So what’s changed?  He warned me in the past that going against the harvesters would be deadly, but perhaps now he thought me up to the task since I’d fought against the fomorian.  I’d like to think that, at least.

“I’m curious as to what you’ll do with this information.”

He stood.

“Is this a test?” I asked.

“No.  I’ve already made my decision.”

He got up to leave.  I didn’t try to pester him with more questions.  I knew better by now.  Although, this time he paused at the door.

“I would recommend,” he said, “at least waiting until after they fix your knife.”

That, I thought, was good advice.  But without knowing what they needed to fix it, there wasn’t much I could do.  Besides, I had other priorities at the moment.  The weekend with my changeling niece was… *exciting*… but it was time to get back to work.

I needed to deal with the voice in the woods.  Well, not the voice itself.  I’m not ready to take on whatever that was.  Rather, I need to deal with the thing it produced.  As I feared, the [antler-tongued zombie](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kpdju6/how_to_survive_camping_rule_13_the_last_rule/) is still wandering around the deep woods.  It’s stayed cold enough that it hasn’t fallen apart yet and I’m worried it’ll go hunting the campers that take hikes down there during the day.  Also, those creatures are usually fairly easy to deal with and I really need a win after getting trounced at Mario Kart by a changeling in a diaper.

I wore my charm vest and took my shotgun and an axe with me.  The axe was a decent weapon, after all.  I’d used it to hunt these things before and it was my preferred melee pick before I started using the knife.  Then I loaded up the four-wheeler and headed into the deep woods.

It took several days of hunting.  This is not unusual for these types of creatures.  The more intelligent ones will realize they’re being hunted and react according to their nature.  Some make a direct assault, others try to make the hunt more difficult in order to strike at the would-be hunter when they’re exhausted.  But the ones that live off base instinct?  Like hunting any other animal.  There’s a lot of waiting involved.

I don’t even have any staff I’d feel comfortable using for bait, either.  Bryan had his dogs, Turtle was, well, *Turtle*, and Ed has earned a peaceful pseudo-retirement.  My aunt and uncle are gone, I can’t ask my brother, and I sure as hell am not asking the old sheriff.  He’s getting around on his prosthetic quite well but it’s still not good enough to win any races against monsters.

So it’s just me.  Out there in the woods.

I keep thinking… maybe I’m seeing things.  I feel like I’m being watched.  No.  *Evaluated*.  Either by the forest of the denizens in it.  I’m not sure.  I swore I wouldn’t become Mattias, but maybe it’s unavoidable.  Maybe this is how it starts, a strange sense here and there, until my reality blurs and becomes separate from yours.

Or maybe it’s just my fears running wild.  Dad always cautioned us against that.  You can’t let your imagination wander.  Keep yourself grounded, he’d say.  The mind will betray you if you give it an inch.

Or maybe I’m just tired.  There’s so much I have to do right now.

Anyway… I’ll stop rambling and get back to what happened when I found the creature.  I’ve said before that they’re not really zombies but it’s the closest description I’ve got.  They don’t hunger for flesh.  They collect specific parts.  And their behavior is far more advanced than zombies; they lure people away, they stalk people, they hunt.  Their intelligence, however, seems on par with that of a base brute.  And they rot.  So… zombies, I guess.

I found it a few hours before sundown.  I was making a final lap of the forest before returning to the house for the evening.  I didn’t expect to find it, but there it was, standing on the side of the road just how my employee had first seen it months ago.  Its body was perhaps a little worse for wear now, but it wasn’t because of decay.  It’d been *adding* to its collection.

Its ears were missing and in their place were grafted the tips of antlers.  Deer hooves were crammed in the eye sockets, but that seemed to have not worked out well for one had fallen out and was dangling from its face by a strip of dried out sinew.  I killed the engine of the four-wheeler and slid off, grabbing the shotgun as I did.  The creature stepped up onto the road and it rattled faintly.  Like something was hitting the insides of its ribcage with every movement.

It opened its mouth.  Instead of a tongue there was the tine of an antler, protruding between rotting gums that were missing most of the teeth.

And I knew.  The replacement for my knife hilt.  I knew.

I guess it’s good that the hilt wasn’t attached to anyone alive but *still*.  Gross.

I waited until it was a little closer before firing the shotgun.  The blast hit it in the chest and threw it backwards with a meaty smack onto the road.  It lay there for a moment and I carefully set the gun aside and picked up the axe.  Then it sat up, abruptly, as if it were tied to strings that were jerking it upright.  It stood in a similar manner, as if muscles didn’t matter, and perhaps they didn’t because the skin around its legs sloshed like it was full of liquid.

The shotgun had torn some holes into its chest like I had shot through paper.  I could see its ribs and inside… dangled a deer skull.  The entire skull.  Its antler curved up the creature’s throat and out its mouth.

It lurched at me again, the deer skull rattling noisily against the ribs, its tongue jerking back and forth erratically.  I took careful aim with my axe as it approached and swung.  I aimed to sever its head and hopefully cut off enough of the antler for a knife, but look, the angle was weird, I’m not that tall, it didn’t go as planned.

The axe hit with a glancing blow and got stuck.  In the spine, I think.  I wrenched at it, trying to rip it free, and then, somewhere in this struggle, I realized that my breath was coming out in a cloud.

The temperature was dropping rapidly.

I released the axe.  The zombie stumbled sideways at the weight and then the axe fell free and landed on the ground.  I didn’t care.  I was done here.  It was time to go.  I’d kill it some other day.  I hauled myself up on the four-wheeler and started the engine.

It was too late.  The frost was here.  And all around me snow and ice formed on the ground, appearing within seconds.  The air felt dry as if the moisture was sucked out of it and turned into the snow that was spreading in all directions around us.

The earth opened up.  The ground around the zombie simply fell inwards, dissolving into a bubbling mire of loose soil and ice.  Hands burst free, fingertips black with frostbite, and they clutched at the legs of the zombie.  I hate that my theory about its muscles was correct, because the calves burst like overripe avocados.

I gave the four-wheeler gas.  The yawning pit was widening.  The road cracked as the frost forced it open.  The vehicle lurched forwards and then the back tires fishtailed, unable to get traction on the ice beneath me.  I struggled to control it, heart pounding, but the road itself was twisting, slanting downwards, drawing me inexorably to the pit.

In desperation, I threw myself off, climbing up over the handlebars and leaping as far as I could away from the growing pit.  I landed on an incline.  I slipped on slush and mud and fell face-first into the ground.  My body was sliding and I rolled over onto my side, frantically trying to dig my feet in for some purchase.

At the center of this funnel was the zombie.  The hands were wrapped around its ribs and its limbs and it thrashed to free itself.  They were dragging it down into the darkness.  And as I slid closer towards that gaping hole, I had a thought.

If they had what they wanted - if the creature could no longer fight back - would the frost recede?

But first… the tongue.  I had to get the tongue.

I stopped fighting the pull of gravity.  Instead, I got my feet underneath me, crouching on the loose soil, frozen into hard pellets by the sudden onset of the cold.  I readied myself to lunge.  And as the collapsing ground carried me towards the pit in an avalanche of dirt, I threw myself forwards and struck the zombie in the chest.

A terrible stench assaulted my senses.  I struggled not to gag, even as bits of flesh came off its face as I clawed for its tongue.  My hands closed on it and it attempted to bite me, but the gums had rotted to the point that they merely broke apart at the pressure.  We were sinking, down into the earth, and my breath was coming in shallow, panicked gasps.  I could not let go of the tongue.  I *needed* that knife.

Hands grabbed at the hem of my jeans.  I kicked at them, putting a knee up on the zombie’s shoulder, and then shoved myself upwards, using its body as a platform.  I got my toes between its ribs.  I wrenched at the tongue, letting out a cry of rage and frustration, letting my anger give me strength.  I would have it.  I would not let my great-aunt’s death be a waste.

A crack.  The antler broke in two.  And I, pulling with all my strength, was thrown completely off-balance and fell sideways.  Off the zombie. Down towards the pit and the darkness and the frozen hands waiting to receive me.

Something else caught hold of me.  I came to an abrupt stop, suspended by my armpits by my shirt.  There was a hand on my collar.  I lay with my back against the inclined sides leading down to the pit, my feet dangling off into nothingness.  And below me, the zombie vanished under a sea of hands, dragging it down with them.

“You see them?” the voice holding me asked.  The same person that saved me from the frost previously.

“I do,” I panted. “Where did they come from?”

“Your land created them, of course.  Your family had a hand in it.”

His voice turned hard at the end.  I was about to ask him how - how did *we* create these?  We eschewed bargains with evil things.  We did not practice sorcery.  But there was no opportunity, for he pulled hard, yanking me up off the ground and he *threw* me away from the pit.

I hit a tree.  A small one, at least, and kind of pinballed off of that and into another tree before falling painfully to the ground.  I’m probably lucky I didn’t break anything but I’ve got some nasty bruises on my side and, uh, let’s just say I’m not going to be wearing a sports bra for a little while here.

I managed to not lose the antler, though.

When I got up, the frost was gone.  So was the zombie and my rescuer.

You know what wasn’t gone?  The four-wheeler.

That’s right.  *I didn’t lose the four-wheeler*.

Came damn close, though.  When the ground closed up again, the four-wheeler was half-buried in the road and the ground was no longer soft.  Took a few days to dig it back out. Dropped it off at the local garage for a tune-up and it’s going to be fine.  Thank goodness.  I’d hate to lose yet *another* four-wheeler, that would just be ridiculous.

The harvesters stopped by while I was still working on freeing the four-wheeler.  I’d expected something like this, so I had the antler on me.  I held it out to them as they came to a stop before me, and one stepped forwards to take it.  It inspected it closely.

“This is from the ones that take,” it said.  “Yes.  It is good that you destroy them.”

“Are they like… your nemesis?”

I’m going to try to start a supernatural war between factions on my campground every chance I get.  The more they fight each other, the less cleanup I have to do.  Sadly, I’ve yet to succeed.  The harvester seemed disinterested, just as they had been when I suggested they go after the ice as retaliation for breaking my knife.  It just pocketed the antler.  Then… it told me the name of the camper that had died.  The one that had become this monstrosity.

“It is a pity we cannot give them their gift,” the harvester sighed.  “But we will give it to you instead, so that it will not be wasted.”

“Wait.  Gift?”

I felt it look at me.  It didn’t answer.  Just looked at me.  I was reminded of Beau’s silent disapproval when I was being slow to figure something out.

The knife.  Crafted from my great-aunt and my cousin.  The halter, crafted from a strip of skin from my brother.

A strip of skin.

There are stories.  Fairytales.  The protagonist is asked for a strip of skin in exchange for something they desperately need.

I made some phone calls.  I’ve got contact info for my campers, after all.  Most of the ones that had a run-in with the harvesters don’t come back.  I can’t blame them for it.  But of the ones that do return, some of them have received a gift.  Not all.  And the ones that did were reluctant to share details, other than it was something that helped them immensely in some way, though they didn’t realize what it was for at the time.

The harvesters don’t just take.  They also give.  I thought their knife a cruel mockery of my great-aunt’s death and then I thought it was a gift to my family line.  But it’s not just us.  It’s not my family that’s special.  It’s everyone they encounter.

I’m a campground manager and I have a choice to make.

Beau has given me a way to end the harvesters.  I wonder if he knew that I was close to realizing what they are.  Humans are not like inhuman things, after all.  We are not beholden to our nature.  We can shape the world.  We can change things.  We can *choose*.

I’m sure I could come up with some spare faces to give them.  People die of natural causes, after all, and I’m on good terms with the funeral home.  It might take a while, but it could be done.  I could get rid of these monsters that killed my great-aunt and maimed so many others.  I hate them.  I cannot stress that enough.  I hate their civil cruelty, I hate that they ask you to agree to your own suffering.  I hate that there’s been nothing I could do about them for so long.

And yet...

I’m going to regret this when my notifications blow up, but I need to know.  If you could get something that may change or even save your life, in exchange for giving up a small piece of your body, would you take the bargain?  What decision do I make for everyone who camps here?  Because this is my choice to make as the campers that face the harvesters have no ability to choose on their own terms.  Do I keep them safe?  Or do I force them to make this sacrifice?

I don’t know what I should do. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

hello is anyone is reading? doesn't matter. so i'm for the most part nothing special (18 male). ya i have a few mental illness like depression, paranoia, and insomnia or at least i had insomnia i had it until 2 years ago. and that's what i'm here about when my insomnia disappeared something happened now if you've had an experience like this then please tell me i know i'm not alone. this happened for the first time at a friend's sleepover. 

my friend who's name is harry because of the great book, he and i didn't have many friends so we would have sleep overs of just him and i. we decided to do a sleepover just the 2 of us for old times sake, we did this 2 years ago. 

but that night we where sleeping and when we were sleeping we both kinda woke up but we didn't really wake up. we where still dreaming but we where conscious in our dream now some of you would say that my friend and i where just lucid dreaming and i thought that's what it was at first. the dream took place in a zombie apocalypse i had a glock19, a military knife, and a crowbar i used the crowbar the most, the pistol would be too loud and would draw more zombies closer, the knife was good but a little to close for comfort and more of a backup melee weapon. 

i was decently skilled with the crowbar both in opening things and in fighting and i am decently skilled with a crowbar when not in the dream, so whatever you can do in the dream is based off of real life. when there i joined 2 people the goal was to survive without dying obviously but also get supplies. so we decided to do that quietly, i used my crowbar to open a back door to a building we had identified as a convenient as soon as i opened it we rushed in. 

i should probably tell you that they looked like, one was a guy with blond hair, a dark green hoodie, no mask, hood pulled up, with green eyes, he had a nice smile with white straight teeth he was a nice guy a little younger then me his hair was well maintained and he was average high for his age he was also skinny but agile. 

the other was a girl dark brown hair in a braid, black hoodie, hood pulled up, she also had a mask, and blue eyes, she didn't really talk much she looked scared but also completely focused and calm. she was about my age she has some rings under her eyes not really all that noticeable but they where there, she was a little short though compared to me and she wasn't fat or skin and bones like me and blonde, she obviously eat correctly and was active. 

i was able to detention the body type from our arms and a strong wind that blew past. i have never seen these people before in my life and i don't remember their names. there faces where new to me. the brain can't make new faces you've never seen before so how was it these people looked nothing alike anyone i've met or seen. that's when i realized that they where real people and from the look they gave me once i figured it out they realize it too, that we where all strangers stuck in a dream. 

i should probably tell you what i looked like when i saw my reflection. i looked mostly the same with my messy dark brown hair, brow soulless eyes, the dark rings underneath my eyes, my skinny body, pail skin, my hair was also the same length. it was down to the bottom of my neck but with everything that was normal there was a major difference. i had a black hoodie, a black cloth mask, i didn't have my glasses, i had fingerless gloves, my hood was down (kinda normal tbh), black pants with black shoes, a black backpack, and i had weapons. 

when we got into the store we immediately started looking for supplies and it didn't take long to find some, we had one person on lookout while the other 2 stuffed there backpacks. the blond guy was lookout then when the girl and i where done stuffing our bags he started packing his. we managed to not get noticed in the building but when we got out that was a different story. as soon as we got out we booked it to the bus, we dogged attacks and nocked some zombie heads on the way there idk why but it seems everyone there knew that when the bus showed up either you get on or die trying. 

even i knew what to do, it's like i had lived in that world for years even though i only was stuck for 1 night. shortly after getting on the bus with a bunch of other people the doors closed and the bus left. idk if anyone was left behind honestly never crossed my mind that someone didn't make it, i was to focused on surviving. 

someone almost blew up the bus with a grenade everyone tried to stop the person even me. in the end they didn't even get to pull the pin we all just chilled in silence for the reminder of the trip. at some point it was over and i woke up. i found out that i wasn't the only person to wake up at that time turned out my friend had the same dream and woke up at the same time too. 

while we where talking he confessed that he was the one with the grenade, i shook my head and we went about our day like nothing happened. the events of that night are still clear to me i never forgot. i wonder why so many people where there and how that even happened but i can't seem to find any answers to my questions. 

after that night things haven't felt the same whenever i'm just laying in bed with my eyes closed but not asleep i feel like i'm not the only person there, like i'm in between the real world and that zombie apocalypse. i can still hear the screams and gun shots, the sound of zombies running after people, but that's not the weirdest part at least not in my opinion. 

whenever i'm just laying there i can feel all the other people around me like we're still there like if a part of us never left that bus. honestly it feels like any moment we go back asleep we could just wake up right where we left off. and that girl always crosses my mind yes she seemed cute i will admit but something didn't seem right with her. 

i never found out why but if we ever go back to that place i'll keep an eye on her who knows what people could be hiding. anyway that's all i had to say just let me know if you have been through that too or if you have answers.

Alright, so this is my fourth day at my grandparents house, and I can already tell you that I've been discussing leaving with Nicole, but she's determined to find out why all the weird things have been happening here for so long.

The main reason of why I want to leave is because I got painfully reminded of one specific entity that lives here. Safe to say, I don't think it likes me much.

It's been in this house since I was a kid. Pretty sure that it's been here for much longer. It would only show itself at night, and it would appear as a shadow figure. I can't tell whetever it's a man or a woman, since I can't ever get a really good look at it.

I know that my grandparents can see it. I've seen them staring at it several times when I was a child. Whenever I ask them about it, they refuse to tell me anything. Typical.

My sister has no idea who this shadow figure is, as she's never seen it, or just doesn't remember seeing it as she's been about 3 years old when we moved out.

The weirdest thing is that it seems to have a problem with me. It sometimes stares at my grandparents, yet it doesn't do anything with them. It completely ignores Nicole, as if not even noticing that she exists. Yet it made it very clear that it doesn't like me.

When I was a kid, I would often get pinched or scratched at night. It would never happen when I was in the basement with Nicole and the Nice Lady though. It actually seemed to avoid the basement, and I was quite happy about it.

Whenever I would encounter the thing, I would freeze in place while it would stare at me. I was scared of it and by how angry it seemed to be with me.

As I grew up and continued to visit my grandparents place, the angrier it seemed to be with me, although it would ignore me.

Till I visited my grandparents four days ago. I'm 25 now, and the last time I've visited my grandparents was 3 years ago, so I guess it had some time to think things through about how much it hated me.

Right on the first night, I woke up in cold sweat in the middle of the night. I had a nightmare, although I couldn't remember what it was. When I calmed down, I had the sudden realization that something was watching me. I looked around and I saw the thing watching me from the doorway. It disappeared quickly, but I couldn't fall asleep for the rest of the night.

It would happen again on the second day, but by the third day I had the feeling that something would dhange. I wasn't wrong.

The feeling came mainly because of the conversation I had with Nicole. She's been asking our grandparents about all the weird things in the house, and she wasn't exactly happy with them refusing to tell us anything. She wants me to go to the basement on the fifth day, and look around for clues. We've never done that before since we never had the time and motivation.

The thing about the basement is that our grandpa spends a lot of time in it, and there's a lock on the door. He always locks the door whenever he goes in and out of the basement. Nicole is sure that there's answers hidden there somewhere, and so she came up with the plan that she would steal the key to the basement, and on the fifth day she'd go around with our grandparents around the neighborhood, meeting with some neighbors while she's at it, while I would sneak into the basement and look for some answers.

I don't really want to do this, but I have to give her an answer by tomorrow. The reason why I don't want to, is because I'm sceptical about finding anything and because the shadow figure doesn't seem to want me to go into the basement.

How do I know that? Well, because that night, after the convesation, I would get choked by someone. I was sleeping when that happened, and when I opened my eyes, I saw the thing staring back at me, it's hands clamped tightly around my neck. Only for a few seconds, and then it disappeared.

I know that it was a warning. It never happened before, and it had no other reason to do that beside my talk with Nicole.

I'm not sure of what to do. On one hand, I want to believe that there's some answers in the basement, but I also don't see the point in doing all of this. It also depends on whetever Nicole actually manages to steal the key.

And so I turn towards the people in here. Should I agree? Or should I decline? I'm fine with both decisions.

So on my first night in [the Redburn Village](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vmns8d/somewhere_outside_dublin_theres_a_retirement_home/), I'd been stalked by a strange, shadowy figure, discovered my neighbours acted all absentminded like a pack of zombies, and stumbled across the corpse of a fellow 'resident'.

For my own safety, I needed to get out. Fast.

Angela still had the moving van, but speaking with her over the phone, you’d have thought they hired her to run their summer marketing campaign. Again and again, she regurgitated the brochures speel about ‘highly-skilled nurses’ and ‘complete peace of mind’.

Well, her meltdown could wait. I planned to catch a bus into Dublin, book myself an overnight stay at one of the city's many overpriced hotels, and send for my wife’s things later.

I loaded some spare clothes and an emergency toolkit into a suitcase and rolled it over to the front gate, where a bulky orderly came out of the hut and said, “Where do ya think you’re going?”

“None of your fecking business. Open the gate.”

“Well, seeing you’re a resident here, I’d say it *is* my business.”

Already seeing red, I clenched my jaw. “I’m gonna count backwards from five. If that gates not open by the time I reach one, we’re gonna have a serious problem.”

“Piss away off. I don’t wanna see you here again. Got it?” His giant arms folded across a burly chest.

Although still fairly hefty from all those decades in construction, my fighting days were long done. I’d have loved to wipe that smug grin off the bastard’s face, but just marching across the village really got me feeling the age in my joints. The guard would have had me seeing stars in no time.

“What’s the big idea?” I asked, now furious.

“Residents aren’t allowed to leave without permission.”

“Whose permission?”

“Ms. Flanigan’s.”

Ah, Ms. Flanigan—the Redburn head honcho. “Then get on your walkie talkie and tell her to get out here, chop chop.”

He smirked, refusing to say another word or budge a single inch even as we squared off with one another, a showdown.

I stormed into the main facility, where thick black grime engulfed the point where two walls met the ceiling. How could they let such a nice building fall into such poor condition?

A short-haired receptionist behind the counter told me the same thing as the guard—residents can’t leave without permission.

“Then go fetch Ms. Flanigan. *Now*.” I said.

“I can’t.”

“Why the feck not?

“Because she’s not here. If you need to speak with her, you can do so at the weekly meeting this evening, in the rec room at dusk.”

Hang about for a whole day? After what happened? Was she joking?

Already fed up with this nonsense, I grabbed my mobile phone and dialed 9-9-9. Twenty minutes later, a squad car pulled up outside the front gate, then two officers—a male and a female—climbed out.

“I’m the one who called,” I said through the bars. “I want to leave, but these people are holding me hostage.”

Behind me, the orderly muttered something into his radio before addressing the officers, “This is Mr. Donnelly, one of our residents.” Getting really close to the gate, he whispered, “He’s got dementia.”

“You lying bastard,” I snapped.

Gently, he touched my arm. “Mr. Donnelly, you live here now, remember? House 17. Do you need help finding your way back?”

The officers exchanged a look as I swiped his hand away. “I *don’t* have dementia. My name is Thomas Donnelly. I’m sixty-eight years old. I’m perfectly capable of looking after myself. And I want to leave.”

“Mr. Donnelly, think carefully now,” the orderly spoke in the same soft tones I used whenever my daughter got scared by thunder back in the day. “You live here now. It’s 2022. Remember?”

“I know what fecking year it is.” I pushed my chest right up against the gate and grabbed the male officer’s collar through the bars. “These people are all crazy. Theres claw marks in my lounge and last night I found a body.”

Over my shoulder, the orderly said, “One of our beloved residents passed away last night. Mr. Donnelly’s taking it pretty hard.”

Now matching the guard's condescending tone, the male officer said, “Don’t worry, we’ll get things straightened out.”

That didn’t exactly inspire me with confidence.

All four of us went back and forth, me growing steadily more agitated, until Prisha, the nurse from before, wandered over accompanied by two orderlies: Neck acne and Potato face.

So far, she was the only person at Redburn who’d acted like a regular human being.

I said, “Prisha, tell these people I’m not senile.”

She gave a vacant stare. Then, with zero compassion in her voice, she said, “Come on Mr. Donnelly, let’s get you home. All this agitation won’t be good for your heart.”

My stomach churned. Why had she called me *Mr. Donnelly*, rather than Thomas?

Her accomplices stepped forward, arms raised. I faced the officers again and said, “They’ve got to her as well.”

Four hands seized me from behind, hooking into my armpits and around my waist. “Don’t let these lunatics take me,” I screamed, my anger giving way to panic.

As the orderlies hauled me away, the female officer calmly called after us, “Mr. Donnelly, why don’t you have a rest and see if you’re feeling better tomorrow? If you’re still upset, give us another call, and we’ll check everything’s okay.”

My previous dismissal of Noel as a basket case echoed bitterly in my mind…

As the guards frogmarched me down the street, past other Redburn residents standing idle in their gardens or wandering aimlessly up and down the road, Neck acne said, “You’re quite the troublemaker, Mr. Donnelly. When Ms. Flannigan hears about the fuss you’ve caused, she’s not gonna be happy.” He snatched the mobile phone from my fanny pack before I could react.

Unable to wrestle free, I said, “Who the feck are you people?”

“We’re the staff,” answered the fat one. “And we’re here…to help.”

Back at my house, the guards dragged me through the hall and into the lounge, where they forced me onto the chair.

Prisha offered me some pills from her nurse’s case, which I knocked out of her hand and onto the floor. Those bastards weren’t pumping me with any drugs.

Neck acne dismissed her and Potato face before turning toward the exit.

“Why are you doing this?” I asked. “This is elder abuse.”

Grinning slyly, he peeked back over his shoulder. “Yeah, yeah. Take it up with Ms. Flanigan.”

On his way toward the door, his eye happened across a picture of Mary. “This shelf. Was it here before?”

“No. I put it up. I know the idea of home maintenance is a frightening concept to your generation, but in my day, men knew how to fix things. And they respected their elders, too.”

He studied the shelf for a moment, his bottom lip pushed out as if mildly impressed. “Don’t cause any more trouble,” he said, then slammed the door.

Supported by the armchair, I stood with a heavy grunt and went over to the bookcase in the corner. On the third shelf, the box containing my wife’s antique cutlery sat open. For decades, that collection seemed so silly and pointless to me, but since the funeral, all Mary’s personal belongings—no matter how mundane—kept her fresh in my memory.

I picked up a photo of us down by the beach. Letting my fingertips brush across her smiling face, I said, “How about all this, eh? Letting Laurel and fecking Hardy push me around?”

My thoughts drifted back to the day that photo got taken: Mary’s twenty-third birthday, one year before Angela came along. On my way back from buying a couple of ice creams, I saw some pervert smack my wife’s backside. Within seconds I had the bastard flat on his back, his jaw permanently realigned six inches to the left.

What the hell happened to me? My younger self would have scoffed at those two muppets. It was long past time somebody set these bastards straight.

At dusk, I pulled on a jacket and stormed over to the main building. Being outdoors so close to dark made me feel exposed and vulnerable, but I couldn’t exactly barricade myself indoors, no way to reach the outside world. Who knew what those evil bastards might have done.

Halfway toward the main facility, that mangy cat blitzed across my path. I lifted one foot and then the other in a waltz, awkwardly trying not to crush the little furball.

The feline stopped long enough to hiss at me.

“Don’t tell me you’re gonna start acting up as well,” I said.

It hissed again, before disappearing beneath a nearby rosebush.

Inside the main building, I trooped up to the front desk and slammed both fists against the counter. “Where’s Ms. Flanigan?”

“Follow me,” said a voice from behind. It belonged to Potato face.

He led me through a series of hallways, all large and luxurious, decorated in pastel shades of pleasant green. With every turn, I saw plaster flaking off walls, or mold creeping up above skirting boards. There was a horrible stink of damp and mildew everywhere.

Potato face led me into a high-ceilinged room filled with several rows of foldable chairs split by a wide, central aisle. A sea of old people had already gathered together. Orderlies and nurses stood in single file behind a podium on the far side of the gloomy crowd.

“Well,” I said to my chubby guide. “Where is she?”

“She’ll…be along…any minute. Have…a seat.”

I shuffled across the very back row, past frail figures stooped over in their chairs.

I sat between a lady with bloodshot eyes redder than a Massey Ferguson and a curly-haired fellow who had an oxygen tank plugged into his nostrils. None of the residents responded to any of my questions. They just sat idle like mindless zombies.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, the fluorescent lights above our heads dimmed as the far swung door open. Then, Ms. Flanigan finally emerged.

She had long, dark hair with a white streak through the middle, pulled into a bun so tight it stretched the skin along her forehead taut. She stood at roughly my height, or thereabouts, and her sharp features reminded me of Angela’s old porcelain dolls.

Neck acne trailed behind her, eyes fixed on me.

Taking her place behind the podium, Ms. Flanigan said, “Good evening, everyone.”

A voice, soft and soothing as a pillow, came out of that hard, narrow mouth. The mob responded in perfect unison. “Good evening, Ms. Flanigan.”

As she took a moment to adjust her notes, I pushed myself up, ready to demand answers.

But then the lights went all the way out. Now I could see were Ms. Flanigan’s eyes, her shiny, silver eyes. From beyond the veil of blackness, she said, “Repeat after me: The Redburn retirement village offers residents a wonderfully elegant and relaxed lifestyle in a beautiful environment.”

Those words hit like a thunderbolt. They seemed to bounce off the walls, echoing all around, rattling my bones.

“—retirement village offers residents a wonderfully elegant and relaxed lifestyle in—”the crowd repeated. Once they finished, she said, “The assisted living facility allows you to enjoy maximum independence but with a safety net of highly skilled nurses for emergencies like cleaning, meals, and activities.”

“…assisted living allows us to enjoy…"

Had I joined a fecking cult? Is that why they wouldn’t let me leave? Were they gearing up for some heaven’s gate crap?

While she rattled off the spiel, her lanky crony came down the aisle, barely visible in the gloom. Every time Ms. Flanigan spoke, her words seemed to creep along my throat. “Here, the staff ensure even the smallest details receive our full attention—”

This made no sense: what made me want to copy her? Had these nutters slipped some kind of mind suppressant into my meds?

Now desperate, I shoved past other residents, rolling wheelchairs aside and knocking over metal walkers.

“At Redburn, you won’t just live.”

“…we won’t just live…"

“If anybody asks how you’re doing, you will tell them you are happy as can be.”

“—we’re as happy as—”

“You will act in service of Redburn.”

“—in service of Redburn.”

By the time I got to the centre aisle, Neck acne was already there and waiting. He grabbed hold of my shoulder. “Going somewhere, Mr. Donnelly?”

Although I sorely wanted to deck the bastard, my aged body couldn’t take slugging it out with a younger man. Better to swallow my pride and live to fight another day. “Just nipping to the bathroom. Old bladder.” I forced a friendly chuckle.

“I *really* think you should listen to the presentation.” Quickly he grabbed my other shoulder so I spun toward the podium. My spine cracked from the pressure of him twisting my arms behind my back, forcing me in the direction of those dazzling eyes. My limbs got pressed almost to the point of dislocating.

With every step forward Ms. Flanigan’s words became fiercer. More intense.

“You are here to serve.”

“We are here to serve,” chanted the living-dead. It took all of my self-control not to join them.

Pushing his lips right up against my ear, the orderly said, “Look into her eyes.”

“You will obey the staff here at Redburn.”

My head whipped wildly from one side to the other. “No. Feck off.”

“You’re hell bent on causing trouble, aren’t you?” he said, frustrated. With that, he forced me past the podium, through the door Ms. Flanigan arrived by.

In a room with a filing cabinet, a wooden table with green chairs on either side, and *another* door in the far wall, Neck acne stood guard, refusing to answer any of my questions and ignoring my empty threats. From through the closed door, I heard the residents mindlessly chant along for several minutes, before slowly shuffling back into the hall.

The instant Ms. Flanigan stepped into the room, I said, “Okay, what the hell’s going on—"

“Quiet,” she said. There was a sudden traffic jam in my throat.

Calmly taking a seat behind the table, Ms. Flanigan said to her enforcer, “Well?”

He fetched a case file from the cabinet and handed it to her. “This is Mr. Donnelly, the troublemaker I warned you about. I think he’s immune.”

The way her lips pursed as she studied the notes set my skin shivering. Locking her eyes on mine, she sharply said, “Sit.”

Obeying the order, my legs marched around the chair where they gave way. I couldn’t climb back to my feet. I’d become superglued to the cushion.

“Not *completely* immune,” she said. After glancing through the notes, she said to her assistant, “Must be the metal plate in his skull. If he’s going to put up this much resistance, there’s no sense keeping him around. If he calls the police again—”

With considerable effort, I pushed myself up off the chair and forced my lips apart. “Now hang on a sec—”

“Sit back down.” Immediately my legs turned to slop, soft and mushy.

She said, “We’ll tell his family he had a heart attack. He’s fresh out of the hospital from a virus.”

“When are you gonna do it?” he asked.

Ms. Flanigan’s stomach grumbled. “Tonight.”

It took all my willpower to say, “What are you two clowns talking about? Heart attack? I’m healthier than an ox. Look, I don’t know—"

“Mr. Donnelly, you’re burning up!” she said, her voice dripping with impatience. The room immediately became a furnace.

“Look, you’re turning green.” The pit of my stomach churned and twisted. “And your pulse won’t stop climbing.” My heart thudded painfully in my chest.

As she leaned forward across the table, those bright eyes locked on mine.

“I can’t remember the last time I saw a man look so…sick” The word ‘sick’ bounced around inside my skull. Darkness pressed tight against me.

However, despite the haze, I continued protesting. Grasping the air like a drowning man, I rocked from side to side. “No…no.”

She conversed with Neck acne for a little while, her words too garbled for me to understand, until, out of nowhere, that thick haze began to lift. Little by little, my strength returned. I could think clearly again. Had whatever drugs they pumped me with worn off?

It didn’t matter, because it seemed like they planned on killing me before I could shine a spotlight on whatever insanity they had planned.

Ms. Flanigan leaned even further forward. Her yellow carrion breath tasted of expired meat, thick and pungent.

Stuck in the chair, my final thoughts were of Mary—of her laying in a hospital bed, sickly pale, while the doctors explained how all they could now do was make her comfortable.

Goodbye Angela, I love you. Don’t cry. I’m off to join your mother…

As Ms. Flanigan put her hand on the very edge of the table, it jerked awkwardly, momentarily throwing her off-balance. After quickly recomposing herself, she pursed her lips, shot Neck acne a sharp look, and said, “I thought I told you to fix that damn wobble?”

“Sorry ma’am,” her assistant stammered, scared to meet her gaze. “We’ll get somebody to look at it.”

She got up and circled the desk, clearly agitated.

Eyes fixed on the floor, Neck acne said, “Shame Mr. Donnelly has to die. He’s a bit of a handyman.”

*Die*. The word echoed in my mind. Felt weird to hear it said so casually.

Ms. Flanigan’s forehead became one large, threatening wrinkle. “What?”

Visibly flustered, he bent down and fumbled through the notes. “Uhh, yeah. Says here he worked construction for thirty years. When I went over earlier, he’d already put up a new shelf.”

She pushed her tongue into her cheek, completing this information. “Change of plans.”

She quickly reached forward and grabbed both sides of my skull. “You love it here at Redburn Mr. Donnelly. You want to help us, don’t you?”

Those giant eyes pierced my soul. Her words still had that compelling quality, only this time, the rest of the world didn’t melt away. I could have spit in her face if I wanted to. But the squeaky wheel gets the oil. I needed to think smart. Maybe if I played along, they’d let me go? At least for now…

Making my face completely neutral, I said, “Yes. I want to help.”

“Good. Then tomorrow, Bernard here will give you with a list of jobs needing done. You will obey his instructions and fix everything he tells you to.”

My arms hung loosely at my sides while I nodded along.

“If anybody comes to check on you, be it your family or the authorities, you’ll tell them you’ve been feeling run down. You’ll explain you’ve been under the weather, but the staff here are doing everything to make you comfortable. And after completing your assigned duties, you’ll report back here at sundown. Do I make myself clear?”

“…Yes Ms. Flanigan.”

“Good.”

With that, she released me, got up, and exited the room through the side door.

Sinking into the chair, I quickly snatched air into my lungs. Immediately my thoughts steered back to Angela—to Potato face asking her to see Ms. Flanigan before. Had they pumped *her* full of drugs too? Maybe that’s why she ignored my calls…

Before I could get any of this straight in my mind, Neck acne dragged me out of the room, through the main facility, all the way back home, where he stuffed me through the front door and said, “I’ll see you tomorrow, bright and early.”

“…Yes sir,” I answered, obediently.

In the lounge, I collapsed onto the armchair. Those giant claw marks were still there. Where had they come from? And why were Ms. Flannigan’s eyes so dazzling? What had Ms. Flannigan planned to do before her assistant spilled the beans about my DIY skills? Drill a hole in my frontal lobe maybe? Or offer me up as some ritual sacrifice?

Well, in any case, I needed to get the feck out of Redburn. But how? I had no way to communicate with the outside world, all the staff seemed somehow involved with this madness, and the place was a regular Fort Knoxx.

As I sat there contemplating my limited options, the one-eyed cat jumped up onto the outside windowsill and brushed back and forth against the glass, meowing loudly.

I glanced at Mary’s picture up on the shelf, back to the noisy critter, and then reluctantly slid open the window. The furball strolled in like it owned the damn place.

I poured a saucer of milk for him, followed by a glass of whiskey for me.

A sadness, unlike anything I’d ever felt before, crashed over me like a wave. Until now, the notion of my death had seemed like an event that couldn’t come fast enough; always too far off—years, possibly even decades away.

But now the big day had almost arrived. The meter was running. And that terrified me.

I Mary's photo for advice. Like always, she only smiled back.

After licking its face clean, the purring cat jumped up onto my lap, curled into a ball, and closed its single eye.

Scratching its soft, warm belly, I let out a deep sigh. “[Fella, we’re in serious trouble](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/).”

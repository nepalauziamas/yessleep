Dear Diary,

Today I was out thrifting, and I found a really nice glass dolly. She has the prettiest black curly hair and the shiniest green eyes you've ever seen. Her little red dress is adorable.

I know my friend Juliet likes collecting glass dolls like these, I think I'll give this one to her for her birthday next week. Is 27 too old for dolls? Oh, what do I care, I’m still writing in a diary!

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

Juliet loved the doll! She especially liked that it looks just like her, they have the same shoes and everything! She named it Dana.

I'm glad I gave it to her, because honestly it was freaking me out a bit.

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

We had that Christmas party yesterday. I got to see everyone besides my parents. Mark and I are heading up north to see them tomorrow.

Juliet is still obsessed with that doll, so I got her and the doll some matching outfits as a joke. She really really liked them. God, she sure loves that doll.

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

Well, here goes the last day of the year! Which means my 28th birthday is only a month away!

Juliet is really freaking me out with that doll. I thought she just liked it, but she *really* likes it. I haven’t seen her go anywhere without it since I gave it to her. What was its name? Dana, that’s right, the little thing is called Dana.

I hope she chills out about it soon, that doll is kinda creepy. It’s like she’s attached to it or something.

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

Juliet is seriously taking this “new year, new me” thing to another level. She’s got more matching outfits with the doll, and she’s acting weirder. It’s like she can’t stand to be without it.

I tried takkng the doll for a minute to wipe something off of it, and Juliet literally lunged at me for it! I’m starting to get a bit worried…

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

Oh my god. This doll obsession is bigger than I thought.

Mark and I stayed the past weekend at Juliet’s house, and she’s gotten rid of all the rest of her dolls. She’s been collecting those since the third grade! She only had Dana now.

She keeps demanding I refer to “Dana” by her name.

Juliet refuses to wear anything that doesn’t match with Dana (which limits her down to about four outfits), won’t eat without Dana, won’t sleep without Dana, heck, she even SHOWERS with Dana.

She only eats the meals Dana likes (which is just Mac n Cheese, Capri Sun, spaghetti, and Coke). I don’t know how she knows what Dana likes, because Dana can’t even eat.

I think I’m going to bring this up to Dana next week when I see her.

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

Juliet is in complete denial of her obsession. She believes she likes the doll a normal amount.

This is honestly terrifying.

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

I think this has gotten out of hand.

Juliet is probably possed by this dang doll or something. Why did I ever get it for her? Last night I was at her house, trying to make her see how bad this is.

I took the doll and Juliet screamed. God, it was terrifying. She was screaming and crying and hitting me and scratching me until I bled and I dropped the doll.

I don’t know what to do anymore, I don’t know how to help her.

How do I help her?

Love,
Lauren.

Dear Diary,

I spoke to Juliet’s parents, some other mutual friends, and her siblings.

We’re calling an priest to see if anything supernatural is going on.

Wish us luck.

Love,
Lauren.

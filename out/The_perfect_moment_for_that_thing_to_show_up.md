   So, I am 28 (M) now, and nothing unreal had ever happened in my life, any out of reality experience, until about a month ago. I was having a bad day at work, arguing with my boss and co-workers, and I knew that when I got home the problems wouldn't stop, since I was having some pretty bad fights with my wife too about some nonsense. In conclusion, my day at that point wasn’t going well. Then, to try to improve my mood, I called some friends and decided to go out for some drinks at a local bar, normal stuff, to forget about problems. Well, nobody could go. I decided to go just by myself, and it sucked. Then I waited until my wife got to sleep, around eleven p.m. and went back home.

  At this point I was just exhausted, stressed out, and starving, so I went real fast to the kitchen to make something to eat before sleep, it was around midnight or one a.m., when I hear some noise outside, on my yard, so I turned my head to the window (I live in a neighborhood with just a couple of houses, a little far from the center of the city) and I saw something, I went check in anger, as I thought it was some animal sneaking around, and I would have to deal with it. But when I went closer, I saw it. It was a creature, with a pallid face and short black hair. It had dark deep eyes, staring at me, and a big U shape smile, with long arms and legs, crouching in the ground, I couldn't believe it. I was so out of my mind that I just yelled "FUCK IT TOO", grabbed my snack and ran upstairs, I was in shock, breathing faster than an asthmatic running a marathon. I remember trying to tell my wife the horror scene I had witnessed, and the monster that was going to kill us both, but she just looked at me, with a “are you serious?” face and went back to sleep.

  Then, i locked my door and trying to convince myself that the thing i had seen wasn't real, I fell asleep too. The next morning, I waked up desperate, trying to figure out if what I had saw was real or a nightmare. My wife was still on the bed, so I decided to see If there was something down there yet. When I had downstairs to my yard, nothing. literally nothing, not even a trace of some monster like that one. I searched everywhere, every single corner of my house, even asked my few neighbors if they had saw something similar, but nothing. To this day every single person that I tell this story laughs at my, or just tell my instantly that I was dreaming, but I don't know, for my it wasn’t that simple, it felt so real. I am still having some issues trying to sleep, and definitely a big fear of getting late night snacks.

No matter how many times I edit this to make myself look the least bit human—I can’t.

I started these posts in an effort to prove that something is wrong with my housemates and I am their victim.

But…halfway through this post, I realised that’s not right. I am not their victim.

They’re mine.

“Bolivia House, I presume.” The old woman’s smile widened, “It’s just like I remember it.”

Her eyes flicked from the door to me. “Would you mind helping me out? Like I said, I am quite lost.”

“Yeah, of course!” I said, my voice sounded different. Giggly. I think it was game night. “What do you need help with?”

Before the woman could answer, a voice spoke up, and I twisted around. Rowan was standing behind me, halfway through a bag of Cheetos. “Who’s at the door?” He said, through a mouthful of orange mush. “Nin, I said don’t talk to strangers.”

“Funny.” I said. “Aren’t you supposed to be crying at Mario Kart?”

“Hey. Kaz is a fucking menace when he’s had a drink. Mix that with weed, and I’m scared for my life.”

“Just say you’re bad at the game!”

“Never.” He stepped into the warm glow of the hall. “And who exactly is knocking on our door in the middle of the night?”

Rowan. Part of me splintered. I forgot what he looked like before the moon got him. Before he started wearing raybans to hide the effects. His expression used to be ignited with almost a permanent look of teasing, a smirk curled on his lips. His eyes used to be warm. Friendly. They used to be pretty to look at, a deep shade of brown with flecks of ember like orange. Now I can barely see them anymore. They’re almost completely taken over whether he’s under her control or not.

Rowan laughed, and I shoved him, shooting the woman an apologetic look. “Ignore him. Do you want to come in?”

The woman nodded gratefully. “Yes!” Her gaze flicked to the door. “Do you two live alone or with others?”

“Why?” Folding his arms, Rowan fixed her with a not-quite smile, “Are you planning on moving in?”

“Goodness, no!” The woman said. “I was just curious. So, four of you, correct?”

“Why so many questions?”

“Rowan.” I warned. “I’m dealing with it.”

The woman nodded along, seemingly grateful for me shutting him up. “Could I use your phone?”

“We don’t have a landline because it’s not 1993.” Rowan stuffed a fistful of cheese-puffs in his mouth, chewing slowly. He sent me a sceptical look, and I knew what he was thinking. He had always been weirdly protective over our household, especially during the middle of the night. 

The doors had to be locked and he checked three times. “Hey, not to be rude, man, but you can just head into town. We’re a college campus here, so the centre is just down the road. Follow the streetlights.”

I shot him a look. “Don’t be rude.” My gaze flicked back to the woman. “Why don’t you come in?”

The memory seeped away, and panicking, I blindly grasped for another piece of myself, tightening my hold. The flash this time was vivid. No longer in the warm glow of the hallway, I was surrounded by darkness. It was so cold. I was shivering, my body wracking. Trembling. I was barefoot, my arms tied behind my back with tough rope. My hands weren’t alone, three pairs entangled with mine. 

Three bodies bound to me. Though I could have sworn my restraints were loosening. The dark didn’t make sense at first; an endless stretch of oblivion in front of me. Before shapes started to bleed into existence. Orange light flickering into view, getting closer and closer, illuminating the room. I was in our basement. When I tipped my head back, a skylight I’d never seen before loomed over me, and I glimpsed a sliver of moon poking behind eerily lit clouds. 

I was crying. Sobbing. My emotions were overwhelming, feral, filling my brain with poison. I had to get out. The words were on my tongue, and I was screaming silently into the lit-up dark. I had to get out. I had to get out. Yanking one wrist free, I exhaled out a heavy breath.

I didn’t want to speak. Because every breath felt like it was going to be my last. And I’d been stupid enough to land us there. “We’re going to die.” Imogen whispered into a hissed mantra. “Oh, god, we’re really going to die.”

“We’re not going to die.” Kaz said softly. “It’s okay, Immie. Breathe. You can breathe, can’t you?”

“No! No, I can’t breathe!”

I pulled again, resisting against a strangled cry, almost sobbing myself when my hands untangled from theirs.

“I can get us out of here.” I managed to hiss out.

"What?" Kaz twisted his head. "How?"

"I can get the police."

"You're kidding." Rowan, this time, scoffed. "You seriously think they'll help us? Did you hear that crazy bitch?"

But I wasn’t listening. I couldn’t listen. All I could think about was escaping or staying, fight or flight—dying or survival. My body hummed with adrenaline and I lunged forwards, my bare knees grazing the concrete floor, before a hand was grasping mine, his nails digging into my skin. Desperation. I felt it emitting from him because I knew he knew. Rowan knew me more than myself. “Don’t.” He whispered in a sharp sob. “I know what you’re going to do, and you can’t, okay? You can’t run.”

Frustration gritted my words between my teeth. “I’m getting help.” I gasped out.

Liar.

Fucking liar.

"Sure.” He said through his teeth. “The cops.”

Hissing in frustration, I tried to shuffle away from him, but he wouldn’t let go. “There’s got to be someone!”

“No.” My housemate tightened his grip. “No, you’re going to run away. Like you always do, Nin. Like when your parents came to visit, and you locked yourself in your room, forcing us to deal with them. You’ve ran away your whole life, and even admitted it’s one of your flaws. But you’ve never helped yourself. You’re going to fucking leave us, and I hate that I know that. I hate that I know exactly what you’re thinking and what you’re going to do, but I can’t help that.” 

He squeezed my hands tighter. I felt his reassurance mixed with terror and desperation and pleading—for me to stay. “I don’t want to die, Nin.” He whispered. “I’m fucking 23 years old. Do you think I want to die down here at the hands of some psychotic cult?”

“They’re not a cult.” Imogen whispered. “Stop saying they’re a cult, you’re scaring me!”

“Well, what else are they?” He deadpanned. “A group of lunatic’s raving about the moon! What do you think they are?”

Rowan entangled his fingers with mine. I tried to pull away, again, refusing to accept my fate—that I was going to die with them.  “I know you’re scared.” He said. “But running away isn’t the answer. You keep telling yourself that because you’re only thinking of your own survival, which, sure, I can understand. Humans are selfish. But I want to believe you won’t do that this time.” I didn’t think about his words when I yanked away from him, feeling his hands slip from mine. And that connection we’d had for the last two years, ignite into nothing. “I know you won’t leave us.” 

His words echoed in my mind as I lunged forwards, tearing myself from the bindings once my wrists were loose. “You wouldn’t do that, right Nin?” Rowan was still speaking with a choked sort of irony, as I crawled forwards on my hands and knees and took off into a stumbled run. Don’t look back, I thought dizzily, my head spinning. If I looked back at them, I’d stay. If I looked back, I’d fucking break apart.

So, I didn’t. I kept running, making it to the basement stairs where glowing candles had been placed on each one, only for a figure to appear at the top. Followed by several others. As they descended, I staggered back, and above me, a perfect full moon graced the skylight, drenching the room in light, creating a circle around my housemates and me, a circle, which stopped halfway up the stairs. I tried again, forcing my legs to run. My brain told me I could get past them. I could break through their human barrier blocking the door. 

But something else was stopping me—something else was preventing me from stepping out of the circle of light. 

As the figure took slow strides down the steps, the moon lighting up her face, I realised youth did not equal beauty. The woman who I had let into our home was dressed in mystifying white. Carrying her own candle, she regarded me with a smile. 

She didn’t speak when I tried to run again, and a man’s arms wrapped around me, suffocating my screams. “Let her run.” The woman said, her voice a melodic murmur. 

Like she was singing into my head. 

“She will regret it.” She continued, situating herself outside of the circle of light while the rest of her group moved in graceful strides, stepping inside it. 

Her eyes darkened when she lay eyes on me. “Imagine abandoning your friends to escape a fate which has already been laid out for the four of you. Such a beautiful fate and you prefer to die alone instead of with them. Young lady, you would have to be mad to run away from something like this.” Her eyes… I wish they sparkled with madness, with lunacy. But they were as clear as my own when I stared into the reflection of the dagger curled between her fingers. The man holding me forced me to my knees when she tipped her head back, her gaze going to the skylight in awe.

“I mean… just look at her. She is beautiful.”

The woman nodded at Kaz, Rowan, and Immie. “Wouldn’t you agree?”

“It’s the moon.” Rowan spluttered, struggling wildly. “What, are you expecting us to marvel at something we’ve seen multiple times? It’s the moon! Just a giant lump of rock in the sky! Wow! Do you want me to start clapping?” Lunging from his restraints, he let out a hysterical hiss of laughter. “Will clapping satisfy you guys? That’ll require untying me first.”

“Rowan.” Kaz, always the peacemaker, bowed his head. “Stop talking. Just… please. You’re making it worse.”

"I don't understand." Imogen spoke up. "Why are you doing this? We didn’t do anything!”

“I have 2 thousand dollars in my savings.” Kaz cut in. “Take everything we have. Just don’t hurt us.”

“Young man.” The woman feigned horror. “Why on earth would we hurt you? This is a blessing! A gift!”

“You knocked us out and tied us up in our own basement.” Rowan said through his teeth. “I think that qualifies as hurting.”

The woman sighed, her eyes trained on the skylight. She took slow strides towards them, and as she neared, she began to speak in a soft voice, almost like a lullaby. When she situated herself behind Imogen, my heart jumped into my throat. 

Something burned inside me. An urge to run. To get out. But there was nowhere to go. Every time I tried to step outside the semi-circle of light, an invisible barrier pushed me back. "It may not seem like it now, but a time once existed, thousands of years ago, when humanity, or at least the citizens of this town, lived in the dark. They believed that if they lived through one hundred days and one hundred nights of darkness, she would take notice. And she did, of course she did. How could she not?” 

Her laugh chilled me to the bone. 

“They rejected the sun for her. All it took was having the desire to chew on their own flesh as sustenance. A final promise to her that they were hers. And always would be. And in turn, she took their second skins, their outlines, granting them abilities way beyond their imagination.” 

Taking a stand behind Rowan, the woman ran her fingers through his hair, yanking his head back when he cringed away. “Our outlines are what makes us human. What attaches us to the earth and forces us to live lives without risk. They are our terrestrial prison’s forcing us to live as the sun desires. Without them? All of that stops. Without our outlines, we are no longer tethered to the ground. We can be twisted and blurred against human physics. We can be edited, rendered, copied in any way she wants. We can live without logic thought and emotions, her beloved puppets she can use for her own personal gain. To her, human beings are her soldiers.”

Her smile dampened. “Now, the town lived on with these abilities. We lived without our outlines, drowned in the darkness and her light until certain people grew greedy, wanting more from her. More power. They demanded more. The ability to spread this phenomenon far and wide across the globe—even the ability to see sunlight once again. Children were curious what it looked like, going to extreme lengths to escape the mirror she placed around the town. And in retaliation, she gave them what they wanted—the sun. Which cursed them with their outline's once again." 

Circling around my housemate’s like a shark, I could tell she was nearing the end of her story. "Now? The human race is weak. The people of this town are weak, living in the sunlight. And we must return to the old ways to find our way back to her. We are so sorry.” This time, she directed her words at the skylight before her eyes found mine. “Of course, we can’t use ourselves. Every generation since has been cursed with a permanent outline. Even if we wanted to sacrifice ourselves, she would never take us."

“What are you talking about?” Kaz surprised me with an uncharacteristic laugh. “You seriously believe this?”

The woman’s eyes darkened. “You, however?" She continued, her lips curved into a smirk, as she stopped in front of him. “You are not children of this town, so we should have no problem skinning your outlines directly from your souls, granting us her light beautiful light once again.” Running the teeth of the blade down Kaz’s cheek, her eyes sparkled. “Bolivia House used to be their place of bloodletting. Where they would surrender under a full moon at exactly midnight and give their outline’s to her light.” The clock on the mantelpiece struck midnight, almost as if on cue, and the hair on my neck stood up. 

“Do it. Now.” She ordered, as the group began to circle my housemates. I used that chance to escape, but I was still trapped in the circle. “By killing the first layer, perforating the soul, the outline will be forced to detach itself from the living host.”

Her voice was practically a moan. “Only then will they show themselves.”

Do you know in a movie when the world suddenly goes in slow motion? That’s what it felt like.

I saw the leader’s lips moving, curling into words which must have pierced Immie’s heart.

I saw her reply. Her frenzied eyes trying to find an escape which didn’t exist. We were trapped in the circle.

Imogen started screaming, flailing, sobbing. And she didn’t stop until the woman’s knife was piercing the top of her head. I watched it plunge in. I watched it pulverise her skull, as moonlight illuminated bright intense red dripped, pooling down Imogen’s face. Carrie. I thought. I’d seen this before in the movie Carrie. But it was real, right in front of me. 

I expected her eyes to flutter shut, but they stayed open, wide, and cartoonish—her lips curved into the start of a scream which never hit the sound barrier. 

"They must suffer. For our ancestors greed, make them suffer.” Were the woman’s words, as she left Imogen, left my housemate to tremble under the teeth of the knife still piercing her skull. 

She wasn’t dying. She was in some middle place, lips trembling, as red continued to flow. Suffer.

The word were haunting the back of my mind as I watched the woman’s white dress turn red as she focused on Imogen, on making the girl really, properly suffer, twisting the blade enough for my housemate’s trembling lips to open slightly into what might have been a gasp. I watched rivulets of red spatter the ground, and it didn’t make sense why there was so much. So much red. I heard Kaz’s choked cry, and saw Rowan’s body jolting, when the knife went in, but I didn’t look. I just looked at their feet, at vivid, pooling, spilling red glistening on cold concrete. There was a point when Rowan’s eyes fell on me. He was being made to suffer. His cries were choked, not quite cries at all. Whimpers. As he was forced to teeter on the edge of death, sitting in moon-drenched red glistening on his face.

I wanted him to stop looking at me.

I wanted him to die quicker, so I wouldn’t have to look at him writhing, choking on blood and brain matter leaking from his nose. His flickering gaze found mine, and I knew I would never forget the look on his face. Not hate, or disdain or resentment. 

Something more powerful than hatred itself, a burning, scolding something which forced me to look away. Forced me to push the memory to back of my own mind in fear that it would eat me alive. 

When the woman suddenly let out a sharp cry, which turned into a laugh, all three of their heads tipped back as the light that I knew left their eyes, and vacant darkness was suddenly filled with her.

Moonlight filled the room once again, this time catching every surface, drenching every face, before slowly moving away, leaving us once again in flickering candlelight. I waited for them to move, to cry out. But red had stopped spattering the ground. Imogen’s head went limp, falling forwards, while Rowan’s rested on Kaz’s shoulder. There was a moment when I thought I was going to laugh. Hysterical bubbles creeping up my throat. I felt myself hit the ground. I felt myself start to crawl over to them before I was yanked back. All of that. 

The words were on my numb lips as I struggled to take in the sight in front of me. 

All of that for nothing. I lifted my head, my throat raw with a strangled cry before I caught sudden movement. A shadow, a static thing bleeding, blossoming between reality and something else I couldn’t register. It was at the corner of my eye, and following it, I found myself blinking at flashes of movement creeping across the back wall. It was a shadow, a silhouette mimicking a human figure. Three of them. The first one dived forwards and seemed to be the most desperate to escape. 

It took a chance, and despite not seeing an identity, I knew it was terrified. I knew it was frantic, calculating its moves before it took them. It dived across the room, sticking to the wall, pressing itself against it, but before it could make it up the stairs, the man who had wrapped his arms around me whipped out a hand, grabbed the thing by its slender neck, and slit its throat. I didn’t even see a throat. I didn’t see the shape of one, or an indication that it even had one. But I did see its reaction, its staggering, stumbling, as it hit the ground, before bleeding into the concrete and disappearing right in front of my eyes. The other two were slower. One stayed back, as if it was guarding my housemate’s bodies, while the other took a stumbled step forwards before falling to its knees.

I saw it give up before it was brutally murdered too. It’s weird. Watching these things, I knew they were shadows, or outlines, but they acted human. 

They acted with fear and pain when they were caught and killed, just like my housemate’s. The last shadow attempted to dart into the darkness itself, but this time the woman took care of it, wrapping her hand around its throat and snapping its neck. 

When it was gone, and the moon had crept behind a cloud, I remembered how to move. I tried to crawl up the stairs, but another figure kicked me down them, and I landed flat on my back, only to find the woman looming over me. “You are a fool.” She said, before pulling and yanking me to a sitting position. Her ice cold fingers grazed my neck before she took a tight hold of my ponytail, yanking my head back so I got a good look at the skylight, and there she was, coming back into focus and filling the sky with her light once again. A low murmur began in the back of my head. Singing. It was enough to stop my struggling, my screams, as the force of her knife bit into my throat. She didn’t press pressure yet. Instead, she was waiting—waiting for one last chance.

I was naïve to think the moon wouldn’t grant her that wish.

“I hope you remember, child.” The woman murmured, latching her lips to my ear as the singing grew louder, and my own eyes were swamped with that same hypnotising light; a glow I couldn’t look away from. I was drowning inside it, and at that moment I was okay with it. “I hope you remember, even in death, that you are a traitor.” She spat. “To your friends, and this town.” 

Moving closer, she teased the blade across my flesh. “Karma is a funny thing,” she said, “And it will get you. No matter what you believe in. Heaven, Hell, or endless nothing for all of eternity—it will get you. And it will bite. Hard.”

I don’t remember the exact time she killed me for the first time. Because I was too busy staring up at the moon, and just like she was agreeing with the woman, the moon herself smiled down at me, emphasising her promise. Shortly after, I was aware of something sharp cutting across my throat. It kind of felt like a zipper. When I was a kid, I had a t-shirt with a zipper my mom had brought home from a thrift store. 

I used to zip it all the way up until it was around my neck, and mom yelled at me thinking I was going to choke myself. That memory was some kind of sweet as I felt my body go limp. I felt wet warm wetness drip down my skin. Not enough to kill me, yet. She needed to make me suffer. 

Just like them. Both the ancestors of the town, and my housemates. 

When she lay me on the concrete to choke on my own breaths, trying and failing to suck oxygen into my lungs, once again I swore I detected movement though my own flickering lashes. I saw it bleed into existence, a static outline, a shadow which upon realising itself, stared down at its own blurry hands, before diving to its feet. I don‘t think they were expecting my outline. I watched the thing flatten itself against the wall, before creeping into the dark. I was waiting for it to reappear, or the thing to end up with the same fate as the others, but I never saw.

The knife bit in again, and this time it was the closing blow.

That was the very time first I died, and the first time I came back.

Both of which I cannot remember. But the pieces of me inside Rowan’s freezer tell me everything I needed to know.

When I came to, I was slick with sweat, screaming into nothing.

After hours, I finally heard them leave the closet. 

Once I was sure they were gone, I climbed out of the freezer, risking a peek through the gap in the door. I was met with that same light. They had torn down the protection on Kaz’s window, and the room was swimming in it, every surface, every corner bleeding in that eerie glow. Imogen was sitting cross legged, head cocked to the side, her wide eyes glued to the sky, while Kaz walked around mindlessly, red mush dribbling from his mouth, half of a chewed arm clutched in his hand. He wasn’t eating it, I thought. 

He wasn’t eating the fucking arm, and from what I’d seen, Imogen and Rowan were the same. Talking about Rowan, I glimpsed my housemate kneeling on his bedroom floor, carving claw-like nails into the carpet. There was something I noticed, something that should have been obvious as they bounced from wall to wall, vacant eyes searching for fresh meat. 

Despite the moon’s glow, her light filling every crevice and corner, none of my housemate’s had shadows. Of course they didn’t, I’d seen them brutally killed right in front of their physical bodies. 

So, what did that make them? The crazy woman—is that what she meant when she spoke of humanity without anchors? Transfixed, I watched the three of them until they gave up and left the room, thundering down the stairs.

And then I waited in baited silence for them to come back. But they didn’t. Exhausted, I remember slumping down and trying to think, trying to piece everything together through my memories I’d gotten back. But when I tried to, my eyes grew heavy, and I slipped into slumber at some point, that lost memory playing like a stuck record, over and over again in my head.  I woke to the smell of bacon. It was strong, an intense aroma turning my gut. When I opened my eyes, I was lying on my back. 

There was a figure hanging over me, and I panicked, crawling back, a scream choked in my throat. But when I gathered myself, I was just looking at Imogen—Imogen, who was no longer a mindless monster, instead all snug in her pink robe, her blonde hair freshly washed and wrapped in a towel.

It was her eyes I noticed first. Still half-lidded, glinting with the familiar shadow of the moon. Her cheeks still gaunt and skeletal, skin paper thin and paling. She hadn’t eaten. None of them had.

That was my karma. Karma for abandoning them—for leaving them to die with not even a fucking hesitation.

After fashioning them into her mindless cannibalistic soldiers, the moon had made me the only thing they could eat.

Imogen’s expression was hard to read, a mixture of anger and pain mixed with forced positivity. She smiled, and the skin around her mouth splintered apart, leaking moonlight. I wondered if she knew that I remembered what I’d done to her… to them. If she did, Imogen didn’t say anything. Like always, she pasted on a smile and reached out a hand. 

When I took it, she pulled me to my feet. “Morning.” She croaked, dragging a hand through tangles in her hair. “Listen, I know you probably want to talk. And I know we have a lot to talk about… but there’s something you should know.” My housemate’s lip curled. “Actually, two things! But, hey, I guess I’ll just show you. It’s… uh.. well, it’s something! Honestly, I have no idea what it is.”

She felt warm. Human, and yet also hollow-- like a static photograph. Her nails dug in, suddenly, and I bit back a cry.

“Can we keep what happened last night between us?” She whispered. “At least for now.”

Imogen remembered.

At least… she remembered the first half of the night before.

I could only nod. What else could I say? What could I say when I was the reason she was like this?

I didn’t just leave them because of my own selfishness. I watched them die.

I let Imogen take my hand, trying to ignore her stumbled feet, how she could barely walk. She pulled me out of Rowan’s room and down the stairs. Halfway down, though, I knew exactly what she was talking about. The boy’s were standing at the bottom. Kaz leaning against the wall, his gaze on his phone, and Rowan with his arms folded playing with a pair of raybans. It was hard to look at them, after seeing them in the memory I’d gotten back. Still human. Still struggling, wide eyes filled with colour. Now, I couldn’t look at them. It was hard to when I knew the reason why they were like this. Why their skin broke apart and splintered, spiderwebbing and leaking glistening moonlight. 

The two of them looked ready to collapse, clearly trying to suppress a feral urge forcing them to eat me. I noticed Kaz was leaning his weight into the wall, and Rowan’s legs were shaking. Doing my best to ignore the state they were in, and the feeling of guilt eating me up from the inside (Not even guilt. Guilt is stealing cash from a friend or cheating on a test. This was something so much more, something I couldn’t take back no matter what I did. This was something I knew was going to kill me over and over again). 

I focused on the front door, which was swamped in darkness. The clock on rustic walls said it was almost 9AM. And yet it was dark outside.

“It's 9am." I said. "And it's pitch black?"

"Well done, genius." Rowan muttered. He didn’t turn around to look at me, and I didn’t blame him. "So much for researching full moon cycle's. The moon can do whatever she wants with us, and this town. She just turned off the fucking sun."

Kaz nodded, straightening up. “There was a full moon, which explains why we can’t remember a thing.” He screwed up his face. “Why I woke up…” Kaz drifted off, and I felt nauseous. “Anyway.” He heaved out a breath. “I’ve checked everywhere. It’s just us. The rest of the world is fine.” 

He held up his phone, and I glimpsed the Twitter trends he was scrolling through. “I’m guessing this is just the start. She’s made it dark so it’s easier for her to strike, and when she does, we’re powerless.”

“Yeah. Without eating.” Rowan said.

“Hey.” Imogen shot him a glare. “I told you. We’ll talk about that… other thing when we figure out what we’re going to do.”

Rowan’s lip curved. “I’m sorry, is anyone going to talk about the elephant in the room?” He nodded to the lounge. “There’s a massacre of random fucking people covering the carpet, stinking up the room, and not one of us is going to say a word?”

His eyes flashed to me, and I caught the exact moment his fingers tightened around the raybans, the lenses splintering.

Imogen shook her head. “Like I said, not yet.” She said softly. “There’s something else.”

He cocked a brow. “You mean something else which isn’t possible Armageddon outside?”

Shoving both of them, Imogen grabbed and yanked them upstairs, gesturing for me to follow. I did, after hesitating. 

This time Imogen led us into my room. It was just how I’d left it. Except when I looked up, following Imogen’s finger, something was scrawled, clawed into the ceiling. Not English. Some kind of dead language carving out an inscription. Rowan stared down at his nails. “Did we… do that?” He hissed out, diving onto my bed. Standing on his toes, he dragged his hands over the carvings.

They were deep enough to leave indentations in the wall. “Holy shit, now she’s just using us as labourers.”

He nodded at Kaz.

“Well?” Jumping off my bed, Rowan winced, seemingly regretting that decision when he couldn’t straighten up. “What does it say?”

Kaz, who looked out of breath, leaning on my bedframe, shot him a scowl. Every time I looked at him, at all of them, they were deteriorating faster, but ignoring it, ignoring their current state. “You’re kidding. You think I can read hieroglyphics?”

“You’re the smart one.” Rowan grinned. “I’m the idiot, Immie’s the Princess. You studied Egyptians and shit at school, right?”

“When I was in fourth grade!”

L
“They’re not hieroglyphics, idiots.” Imogen spoke up. Tipping her head back and frowning at the markings, she hummed. “I don’t know what language it is, but we should probably figure it out. I think she—I mean- it--- is trying to tell us something.”

“And the dead people?” Rowan said. “What do we do about them?”

“There’s rubber gloves and trash bags in the kitchen.” Immie said. “We can… dispose of them for now.”

“What happens when their friends come sniffing around here?” Kaz said. “There were at least six of them. Six missing people is noticeable, no matter how hard we try and hide it. And judging from this place, they care about what happens to townies.”

“So, we can admit this right now then?” Rowan folded his arms. “The full moon sent us full Teen Wolf, and we ripped them apart.”

There was a slight pause, and all eyes fell on me.

My housemate broke the silence with a laugh. 

“Okay, come on.” He said. “She knows. Nin’s known since that first night Immie beat me at Monopoly, and the moon got us,” He groaned. “Pretty sure I was copied enough times to forget half of my life last night, but I do have a vague memory of a car-ride. And yeah, under the influence, I told Nin about our eating habits.”

Imogen paled. “What?” She squeaked. I caught a flash of shame across her face. Embarrassment. “But—”

“It’s okay.” I said. “I mean, it’s not okay. But I’m dealing with it.” I swallowed barf. “Mostly.”

“Right.” Kaz said. “So, you just happened to casually mention that we have to eat her to survive?”

“Well, yeah.” Rowan’s lip pricked. “How else did you want me to say it? She was going to find out eventually.”

“No.” Imogen looked like she was going to throw up, the skin around her eyes splintering. “No, this isn’t okay. We can’t expect her to.. you know…” she screwed up her face. “I’m sorry, but would you happily agree to being eaten alive?”

“It’s the least she could do.” Rowan retorted. “She’s the reason why we’re like this. We’re reminded of that every time we don’t eat.” His voice choked up, and I wasn’t expecting it. “It fucking hurts, Imogen. And you expect me to keep my mouth shut? You expect me to keep going, pasting a smile on my face, even when I’m forced to remember the shit that happened?”

The girl’s expression twisted. “Don’t bring that up.”

“Why?” He challenged. “Why are you too scared to admit that we’re like this because of her? We haven’t eaten, so we’re being punished. And right now, I have a 1080P resolution movie screen replaying my death over and over and over again.”

“We’re okay if we eat.” Kaz said quietly. “We… well, we forget. So…” He drifted off, and Rowan nodded.

“Exactly. As usual, Kaz is the logical one. We need to eat, Imogen. If we don’t, she’ll make us eat.”

Imogen squeezed her eyes shut. “You’re gross.” She whispered.

“No, I’m right.”

I’d like to type that their words stung,  that I wanted to get the hell away from their conversation, and what they were implying. But I don’t deserve to write something like that. They were right. Karma was coming back to bite me on the ass.

Imogen opened her mouth to reply, but my phone buzzed in my jeans and I made myself scarce, grateful for the distraction. I could hear them arguing as I continued down the hall. Frowning at my phone screen, a familiar name jumped out at me.

Poppy.

Looking at the screen, I’d missed 8 texts from her.

When I answered, her voice was sharp, piercing my ear.

“Nin!” She hissed. “Have you seen Sam? He didn’t come home last night, and.. it’s dark. I don’t know why it’s dark, is the sun just late coming up? Look, when you see Sam, can you tell him to come home? I’m worried about him. He went out with his weird friends, and not that I think they’re total freaks, but they carry guns. Like, they’re a bad influence on him—"

I cut her off. “I haven’t seen him.” I whispered. “I’ll.. I’ll look for him, though.”

“Are you coming to the town meeting?” She said. Like Sam, Poppy spoke like she’d been fast-forwarded, her words coming out in a bout of entangled nothing strewn together. “There’s a town meeting tonight. Classes are still happening. According to the local news, it’s ash from a volcano eruption.” She paused. “Nin, there’s no volcano’s around here! What, is it Yellowstone? If it was Yellowstone, it would be all over the news, and literally nobody is talking about it. It’s just our town.”

“Classes?” I said stupidly, only registering half of what she’d said.

“Yeah. Townies are still going to class like nothing is happening. Meanwhile, some freshman girl has been sobbing outside my house for the last hour. She’s driving me crazy.” Poppy took a breath.” Are you sure you haven’t seen Sam?”

“Uh, yeah.” I said, half aware of Imogen storming into the kitchen and slamming the door. “Why?”

She sighed. “Sam was on edge yesterday. Acting weird. One of his friend’s is on the town council, and he came to talk to him. They chatted for a while, didn’t let me in the room, and then just left.” She scoffed. “Taking a bunch of hunting guns.”

I don’t know what possessed me to end the call. Maybe it was the ghost of what happened the night before stirring in the back of my mind. Sam had gotten away. I’d seen him at the corner of my eye. I’d seen him dart right out of the front door.

Then why did I feel sick to my stomach?

I knew the night before, my housemates has stuck around for most of the night, before disappearing before dawn.

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine. What did they do after that? Where did they go?

When I headed back into my room, Immie had retired to her room. Kaz was clanging around in the kitchen making coffee, and Rowan stood with his head tipped back, his gaze stuck to my ceiling. 

I figured he wanted to be alone, and I really wasn’t looking forward to the inevitable conversation we’d be having now I had my memories back. When I took a step back, though, he climbed back onto the bed, reached out his hand, grazing his nails across plaster. “Build.” He muttered, digging his fingernails into the indentations. I leaned against the wall, watching him study the symbols with a slight curl on his lip. “Build?” I finally said. “You can read that?”

He nodded. “Not well. It’s all squiggly. But when I really focus on it, I can sort of read it.” He pointed. “See. It reminds me a little of hiragana and katakana. But it’s a cocktail of both, with added hieroglyphs. The thing that looks like a house? I don’t know why, but I think it says ‘build’ while the rest is a blur. But if I was to take a guess, this here?” His finger moved. 

“This thing? The squiggle which looks kinda like a minion? I think it either says ‘more’ or maybe even ‘well’. So, in conclusion, it definitely looks like instructions.” My housemate shot me a look. “Instructions to what, though? That’s the question.”

“Build more.” I said, frowning at the symbols.

“Yeah.” Rowan clucked his tongue. “This is straight out of a horror movie.”

“You can read an ancient language?”

He twisted to look at me, his lip curling. “Yeah. No thanks to you.”

“Rowan—”

“I’m kinda hungry.” He said, cutting me off. Jumping down, he let out an exaggerated sigh. “I wonder what’s for breakfast.”

I went over the word-limit a while ago, so I’m going to stop there. I’ve taken photos of my ceiling, so I’ll upload them.

I’m about to head to classes.

Sam is still missing, and we’re no closer to figuring out the full message carved out. All we’ve managed to get is Build More.

It’s taken me a while to write this part. It’s not been long since I came back. Lucky number 29. If there’s one thing my housemates suck at, it’s talking. 

They can talk about video games and TV shows and anything else, but when it comes to the elephant in the room—they refuse. At least Imogen does. The boy’s seem more inclined to talk now, but Immie seems ashamed of what she is, and what she does.  A few hours ago, I watched them start to revert to static, growing increasingly more feral and animal-like. Imogen curled up in her room, pressing her head into her arms, while Kaz and Rowan kept going to the lounge, circling the bodies they were supposed to be cleaning up. They didn’t drop hints, but they didn’t have to. So, I went to my room like every other full moon, and I went to sleep on my bed. 

It’s better not to think about it. I took a sleeping pill, but I still felt it. I felt their warm arms around me, carrying me downstairs. They didn’t kill me this time. I don’t think they were thinking clearly enough to have a cohesive plan. She was in full control. 

Without eating, it was easier for her to bleed into their heads and drive them crazy with their first deaths. They’d reverted back to basic survival instinct, ripping me apart.

Like I said, I didn’t feel all of it in its entirety. Just the start of it, teeth piercing my stomach, and then my arms and legs. Luckily, that’s when it went dark.

I woke up with that same hollow sensation, only just glimpsing Imogen heaving my skeletal corpse across the hall.

Since I woke up, it’s been silent. They’re currently upstairs trying to figure out the message, and I’m keeping an eye out for the moon. It’s currently 11AM. The town meeting was cancelled last night, no doubt because half of them are currently six feet under in our yard. There’s a meeting tonight, and Kaz said he’s going to go scope it out and figure out what’s going on. When I get into class, I’m going to try find Sam.

If he’s not among the dead my housemate’s killed, where is he?

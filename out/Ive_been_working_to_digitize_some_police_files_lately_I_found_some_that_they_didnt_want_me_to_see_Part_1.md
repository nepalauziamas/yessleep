 

Alright, introductions first. My name is definitely not Jake, but that’s what I’m going to call myself. Also, any name or place in here is made up as well. I don’t know what exactly I’m doing here, but it doesn’t seem right to give real names or places.

Anyway, I just recently got a job at a police station that seems to have been living in the nineteenth century up until this point. My job is to digitize their many records, put them into their computer system. Definitely not demeaning to the six years I spent in college pursuing an IT degree, but I need a job and this is where the temp agency sent me. 

But whatever. No one needs to hear me whine about the economy. Moving onto the important stuff. The police station I work at has a room that I’m not allowed in, I’m not to digitize the records in there. I’ve been told that those are the more recent cases, that they can’t hand them to me for fear of a potential leak that could jeopardize the cases. I guess it follows, since the most recent case I’ve digitized is from five years ago. Whatever, who cares. 

What matters is that the evidence locker room is through that room. So whenever I come to a report that involves evidence collected and there’s no picture on file, I have to send one of the desk-ridden cops in there to take a picture. And a few days ago, the only cop in there was this old fucker named Logan, who can’t work with technology to save his life. So when I asked him about it, he flipped me the middle finger before reconsidering and giving me his keys. 

“Don’t fuck around in the records room,” he said. I agreed. Not like I had much choice, the records room had a window that he could clearly see through from his desk. So I went, took a picture of a decade-old bloody knife, and came back to the records room. Through the window I saw that Logan wasn’t at his desk, and then I heard the incredibly heavy bathroom doors shut. 

One thing everyone knows about Logan is his absolutely legendary bathroom breaks. The man will be in there for over ten minutes once every two hours, if not more. So I decided to look around the records room a little bit. And one box caught my attention. It was labeled “Hillside College, 3/20/22-3/28/22.” 

This caught my attention for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I actually went to Hillside College, but I graduated in the spring of 2021. Secondly, I was pretty sure I knew what happened in this case, I’d seen it on the local news. But even the label was strange to me; the incident of 3/28/22 at Hillside College had been a one-night event, a bunch of college students had died after someone drugged them at a dorm party. I’d heard some crazy shit had gone down, but I was pretty sure it was just one night.

I looked into the box, glancing back at Logan’s chair every few seconds. It was filled to the brim with case files, separated into plastic bags. I grabbed the top one. It was labeled “Samantha Wexler.” I opened it, took out my phone, and took pictures of each document within, and then put it back. I rushed back to my desk, and Logan returned ten minutes later. A new record for him. 

I worked the rest of the day, and no one said anything else to me about the records room. Seems like I got away with it. When I got home that night, I looked through my haul of pictures. There were some identification documents about Samantha, sheets with descriptions like race, gender, name, etc; the stuff you fill out when giving a statement, along with a picture of Samantha, in addition to her actual statement. The statement had been given on 3/20/22.

I looked up her name, and the only thing I found was a single news story about the 3/28/22 incident. She had been one of the casualties. This whole thing was so weird. My first thought was she had given an unrelated statement earlier that week, but even that seemed to not pass the bullshit test. Even weirder was that I could only find a single news story about the 3/28 event. Over a dozen kids had died and only one station thought it was important enough to write about? That should have been national news.

All of that was certainly confusing, but Samantha’s statement was something else entirely.

*So a week ago, 3/13/22, I met Colin Pollack for the first time. He came up to me while I was sitting alone at breakfast in the mess hall. I’m not a loner or anything, but that morning I was alone. He was nice, we talked for a little while about various things. He said he was trying to put himself out there more and talk to people. That made enough sense, so we exchanged contact information and agreed to text sometime soon. I’ve had people come up to me when I was alone at a meal before, but it was usually dudes hitting on me, and this seemed to definitely not be that.*

*The main thing about Colin that seems notable is his distinct appearance. He had a long scar down his face, snaking between his eyes and around his nose before ending at his mouth. His right thumb was also kind of deformed. It seemed stubby, and I doubt he got much use out of it.* 

*So I’m sure you’ve been on Hillside campus before. It’s quite different from most campuses. It’s in Springfield, but you’d never call Springfield a college town. The city and campus are separate, and the campus is almost like its own little community on the edge of town. I liked it that way, liked that it never felt like I was walking through a city. It felt like a real college experience. And all around Hillside College is this forest. They call it an arboretum. It’s got miles of walking and biking trails inside of it.* 

*On 3/17/22, me and my friends Kassidy and Paul went on the walking trail at night, to go to the Chapel. The Chapel is like a spooky little building out on the trails, used to be an actual place for Catholics to worship and all that. Now it was protected, like a historical site or something, and college kids go out to it at night to scare themselves. I would go like once a month when there was nothing else to do, it was always fun. That was what we were doing that night. I knew the way by then, and we were about twenty minutes into a thirty minute walk when it got a little strange.* 

*Firstly, the rustling in the woods was strange, different than usual. It felt centralized, right behind us. A couple times we stopped dead all at once, to test it, and then the rustling would continue for a moment after we stopped moving before stopping too. Almost like something was following us, but we could never see it. Paul called me a pussy or something like that, and we kept going, neither him nor Kassidy seemed bothered by it, but it really freaked me out.*

*The footprints were super weird too. Paul actually pointed them out, but he seemed super excited by them. He stopped suddenly and put his hand inside of one of them, it was like measuring your hand against a childs. They looked like paws, Paul said they were bear tracks. Later that night I looked up bear tracks, and I didn’t think that’s what they were. They left the trail after a bit, and we were almost to the Chapel so I figured there was no point in turning back despite my apprehension.*

*Right by the Chapel there’s this statue of Mary, it’s hidden in the woods a little ways off but visible from the right angle. As we passed it by, I flashed my phone’s flashlight over it for a second, and I gave a little squeal and dropped my phone when I got a good look. I could have sworn it looked like it was crying, with little trails under the statue’s eyes like tears, scared me half to death. My friends noticed my fear and shined their lights over it, but it looked normal. Paul didn’t make fun of me this time, I guess I looked really rattled.*

*I decided that moment to not go into the Chapel personally, but Paul seemed super set on going inside. Kassidy and I waited a little back from the door, and Paul walked up to it. The moment Paul touched the door handle there was an incredibly aggressive series of knocks from inside. I actually fell over from fright, and Kassidy jumped back in surprise. Paul had jumped a fair bit back from the door as well, and looked really scared for the first time that evening.* 

*Laughing came from inside. It was Colin inside, along with another guy. The other guy, I never got his name, looked super similar to Colin, they could’ve been brothers.. They had a very similar scar. Colin’s friend was massive though, easily six and a half feet tall and muscular. He had a very strange look in his eyes. Both of them were laughing super hard after spooking us, apologizing a bit but they seemed super proud of themselves for scaring the three of us.*

*Colin noticed me and helped me up. We exchanged pleasantries, saying “wow, what a coincidence” that we were both there at the same time and all five of us walked back to the campus together. I couldn’t help but notice that Colin seemed to be lost in thought a lot on the way back. He missed conversation and would look surprised when someone talked to him, like his mind was somewhere else. When he talked he was as kind as he had been that first day, just seeming like the nicest guy.*

*As we went back, all of the scary things from before seemed to have dissipated. We couldn’t find the footprints, the Mary statue was normal and the woods rustled like one would expect. I checked my locks a couple of times that night though and really struggled to fall asleep.* 

*I avoided the trails for the next few days. I really hadn’t liked the feeling of the trails on that night and honestly would have been fine never going back to them. But then, earlier tonight, I got a text from Paul.*

*Apparently he and Colin had really hit it off on that night out in the woods, and had been hanging out since. Paul said he wanted to go back out to the Chapel, and that Kassidy had already said she was down. Apparently there was some wicked graffiti inside that we’d missed since we hadn’t actually gone inside three days ago. I told him that I’d sit this one out, and went back to doing nothing.*

*I got a knock on my door like twenty seconds after sending the text. I went to the door and opened it, not looking in the peephole to see who it was. I probably would’ve answered the door anyways, though, since Colin didn’t take the gun out of his pocket until I had opened the door.* 

*He said he had something to show me, and gestured with the gun down the hallway. I probably should’ve slammed the door, moved quickly or something, but with a gun in my face I had no idea how to act. So I went where he wanted. He must’ve put the gun away while we were walking, because we passed a couple of people on the way. He waved and greeted them like it was nothing and we kept walking. I tried to look as terrified as possible but no one read my hints.*

*He led me out of the building and towards the trails. Once we were out of sight of any streetlamps, he pressed the gun against my back and pulled out a flashlight. I didn’t need instructions on where to go, I knew we were headed to the Chapel for whatever reason.*

*The woods felt super off that night, too. All of the oddities from the previous time out there were magnified. There were footprints all over the walkway, some resembling the ones we’d seen last time but others too, some looking hooved, some looking reptilian, and others still that seemed like they didn’t belong to anything I could think of. It felt like every step I took was being monitored from the forest, and sometimes I’d glance off to the sides of the path to see what I thought were eyes staring at me for maybe a split second. Everything just felt alien, like I didn’t belong there anymore, as though there weren't thousands of people sleeping in man-made buildings less than two miles from there.* 

*When we got to the statue of Mary I didn’t need to look to know it was crying, I could hear weeping coming from that direction.* 

*We reached the chapel, and Colin’s massive companion was there with Kassidy and Paul, right next to the door. He had a gun to Paul’s head and his left hand was wrapped around Kassidy’s arm. They both seemed terrified, and when they saw me they started stifling tears. Paul mouthed an apology to me.*

*Colin left from behind me but kept the gun trained on me. He gave a nod and without flinching his companion pulled the trigger and Paul’s body fell over limply. Kassidy let out a scream before the gun was moved to her own head, causing her to go silent. I didn’t scream, I don’t think, but maybe I did. I couldn’t move.* 

*As this went on the woods progressively got more and more violent with movement. I couldn’t see anything except for some eyes, but it seemed like monstrous creatures were moving around out there, always just out of sight.*

*Colin gave me a sharp push and sent me to the ground. He suddenly tucked the gun behind his back, and rushed towards me, embracing me and giving me a passionate kiss. As he released me, he whispered to me.*

*“You’re safe, don’t worry. You’ll be with me when this is all over.”*

*He smirked as he stood up. He handed me the flashlight and moved my arms to keep it trained on the Chapel.* 

*“Don’t move, I’ve got something to show you.”*

*I couldn’t have moved if I wanted to, I was paralyzed. Colin stood up and whistled loudly. The other man grabbed Kassidy and picked her up like a limp doll. She didn’t move to resist, but her eyes were pleading with me, asking me to do something, right up until she disappeared into the building.* 

*Colin, as though he was lighting a cigarette, pulled out a book of matches and struck one. With one more smirk, he threw the lit match into the building and the whole thing exploded. I don’t know what was inside the Chapel but I was hit with a shock wave that launched me onto my back.*

*When I sat up, the forest was gone.* 

*The night was suddenly very bright, and I could see all around me. I saw monstrous creatures everywhere, surrounding me but not concerned with me. The largest one was vaguely humanoid with elongated limbs, with skin that was pitch-black stretched over its form. The middle finger on each hand was whip-like and it was using this to strike other creatures that moved around it. It had the widest grin I’ve ever seen, truly stretching ear to ear, and on its head was a horrible crown that looked like it was stitched into its skin, with sharp points all over it.*

*The other creatures scurried around the large one. I could see the creatures that had seemingly made all of the footprints I had seen earlier. One was a monstrous bull-like creature, but its face was like that of a lion in incredible pain and its legs ended in massive paws. There were goat-like creatures too, with elongated and warped backs, like horrible hunchbacks. They stood on two hooved feet with no arms in sight. The owner of the reptilian claws was there too, but it looked more like a pig than a reptile. It had horns sticking through the top of its mouth that curved inward and stabbed into its brain, and it was covered in horrible green scales.*

*The monsters seemed to be doing a task of some sort, and the humanoid in the center was directing them with its whip-fingers. Each was pushing a large dark orb around. I tried to look at the orbs, but found it difficult to focus on one. Whenever an orb was in my peripheral vision, it seemed like there were horrified, contorted human faces inside of them, but looking at them straight on made them disappear.*

*Colin was there too, in the background almost. He looked proud. I don’t think he looked away from my face.*

*Suddenly I found my eyes resting on the humanoid creature again, and just as I did, it turned its face slightly and made direct eye contact with me. It looked like it grinned even wider, and every other horrible monster stopped their work and stared at me.*   


*That was what broke my paralysis. I stood and ran away. The ground had turned to sand and it was hard to run on, but at one point I was no longer on the sand, I was back on the damp forest trails. I turned around at that point, and behind me was nothing but forest.* 

*I pointed my flashlight and caught a glimpse of the Mary statue. It had what looked like tears, but they were blood red. I blinked and it was back to normal.* 

*I turned my flashlight back to where I had run from, but I was out of vision of the chapel at this point. I could see a rising red glow where it was burning, though, and my flashlight found Colin’s face. For one instant, I swear, he had the face of that horrible monster before turning into his own smirk. He turned and walked out of sight.*

Some pretty chilling stuff, I know. None of it really made sense to me after doing all the research I could on the subject. I couldn’t find any news stories about the Chapel, but the incident was listed within some notes in the police file. There were three bodies at the scene, one shot in the head and two others being pulled, charred, from the wreckage.

There isn’t any mention of Colin anywhere else, and I can’t find him mentioned anywhere online, not fitting Samantha’s description anyways.

The one article about the incident of 3/28/22 lists Samantha as having been found post-overdose, already dead. Two of the other dead students had the first names Paul and Kassidy, but that seems to contradict the police report which seems to say that their bodies were at the Chapel

Of course, that is to say nothing about the horrible images Samantha talked about. That seems like the biggest connection to drugs in the story, like something you’d come up with in the midst of a bad trip. 

Those descriptions have had a bad effect on me; I can’t seem to get those monsters out of my mind, especially the humanoid figure she talked about, with his massive limbs. I’ve struggled sleeping as images of it go through my mind. Despite only having her description, it feels as though I know for sure what the horrible thing looks like.

Some crazy shit is most definitely going on with all of this. I think I’m gonna see if I can find more from that evidence box, and will update when I do. Maybe it’s paranoia, but it feels like the police station may be covering something up? That seems silly but these documents seem official as far as I can tell, and completely contradict info given to the public. 

The most eerie part of it all is something else, though. The police chief, who I see every day, has the exact same scar that Samantha said was on both Colin and the other man’s face. And his last name is Pollack. 

I’ll be sure to tread carefully, but something weird is definitely up.

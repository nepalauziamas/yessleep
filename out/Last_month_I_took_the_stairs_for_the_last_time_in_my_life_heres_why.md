That was just a regular Friday when I fell a victim to something sinister. A joke? A prank? Maybe. But for sure - my life won’t be quite the same after the events of that evening. This seems like a right place to describe my experience, but let me share some details first.

I am your regular office working nobody, who sacrifices best years of his life to an accounting company downtown. We have around 150 employees, therefore the company rents a whole floor of a  business tower. The building itself is quite new with all the amenities like food court, gym and such and such.

That Friday most of us stayed late due to a birthday party of one of the Heads of numerous departments. You know - all the ass licking and cheap wine wrapped in wishing the best and trying to get some credit for developing some better social links. For, you know, better chances of promotion and such. I was there too, exactly for that reason.

As the clock came close to 23:00 - the mob heated up by piss-grade alcohol decided they should move  to a nearby bar for extras. I chose to pass, especially considering that Georgia, who was like 20 years older than me, started to show some weird drunk signs of sympathy towards myself. So as everybody was grabbing their coats and heading to elevators - I’ve silently slipped through a door leading to the stairs down. A quick remark: our office is on the 25th floor of the tower, so yes - it was rather a lone and long descent towards the night.  But better this than choking from the drunken fume in the tight space, trying to disappear from Georgia’s sight. 

So, with a briefcase in my hand and some uneasy expectations towards Monday’s cheap talks on how everybody got wasted - I took the stairs. This is where my life divided into “before” and “then”…

Some people are afraid of elevators, stating how claustrophobic those devices are, I get it. I guess the same can be said about the staircases sometimes. Especially in the places, where those are not supposed to be cozy or used frequently. Like in business centers. Or bigger malls. Hospitals, maybe? Anyways, the thing looked like a concrete tube filled with endless slabs of steps, bathed in dim fluorescent light. Not a single window, no lounge music in the speakers, no people around. If I were more faint at heart, I’d say the place is exactly this - claustrophobic. I caught myself rolling that thought through my mind and chuckled a bit, as my feet counted the steps downwards.

I wasn’t in a rush, besides, due to my head being a bit hazy from the wine - I had no intention of slipping down on my butt. Moving in a comfortable pace I registered that each second floor has a huge number painted on the wall in a dull brownish-red color: 25, 23, 21.

“So the painter went to 20th floor and was like: ”Nope, ain’t my job“ and went further” - I laughed silly at my own joke. 

Then I’ve noticed something: at the top right corner of the door leading back to the offices on floor 20 - there was a small glossy “X” painted over. I don’t know why, either natural curiosity or being a bit drunk - this looked quite interesting to me, so I took a closer look. That “X” was painted with a lipstick, no doubt. I’m pretty sure, that the painter guy wouldn’t choose that as his tool of trade. Suddenly my smartwatch vibrated slightly, notifying it’s 23:00 already, so you idiot should better stop staring at the door and keep moving. So I did.

&#x200B;

Imagine my surprise, when the same “X” appeared at the door on the floor below. And the next one. And then at 17th floor too.

“Well, the rational explanation would be… Some lady smoker, who uses this space as her smoking room marked the doors that are closed at working hours… But is that even possible, considering the fire safety rules?” - I mumbled to myself aloud, as I kept descending down the stairs.

Next surprise came short - there was an empty bottle of whiskey and a bra lying in the corner on floor 15.

“Well, somebody really knows how to party…” - all I thought at the time. 

The buzzing of the lamps was the only reaction to my joke and that buzzing, actually, started to resonate with my head, promising migraine yet to come. I felt thirsty.

Close to floor 11 I saw a sheet of paper lying on the floor, covered in clumsy handwriting. Should I say at this point, that each single door still had an “X” painted over it? Without proper realization of my actions I’ve picked the paper up, to check out on possible clues of who might have dropped it. This could give me an understanding of who the drunk bra-less lady was, running around, marking doors with lipstick.

&#x200B;

This is what it was:

“*Note: This shit keeps disappearing… For fuck’s sake. Alright, I’ll keep this in my hand to prevent it clearing out.*

*My name is Amanda Smith. I work for Jones & Co. Legal company at \[our business tower address here\]. My office is on the 21st floor. If you are reading this - I need help. I am trapped. Last Monday I’ve decided to kickstart the new Me. Lose some weight, get my thoughts together, get my life in order. I’ve climbed the stairs up to 21st floor. Almost spew my lungs out. But it should be worth it. At the end of the day I went for the stairs again. That’s when the troubles start. I walked and walked and walked, but the stairs never ended.* 

*My cellphone is not working. Probably because all this concrete around the signal can’t break in. I don’t know what’s happening. It feels like days passed. I’m starving, I’m thirsty. My body starts to itch from the office outfit. But there’s just no end to these fucking stairs. I’m not crazy. They won’t end.*

&#x200B;

*At some point I got really scared and decided to turn around and get back to my office floor. Of course, I’ve tried each door on my way - they appear to be closed. Knocking on them, screaming, shouting for help didn’t do much. So I’ve started to mark them with the lipstick, to note where I’ve been already. Sharpie would do a better job, but it’s all I got.*“

I caught myself standing with a foot over the next step. Is this a joke? Did somebody just have a good time here and decided to prank a stranger by leaving a disturbing note? This was silly as it sounds. But kudos to the prankster - he/she got me for a second. I kept moving.

&#x200B;

Next flight of the stairs presented me a next page of this improvised “diary”, if I may call it that.

“*I’m dying of thirst. Just realized I have this bottle of whiskey in my purse, which I was supposed to throw into the sea. Like, you know, a symbolical action of fighting my addictions. I’ll take a sip or two to wet my throat.* 

*If you are reading this - have you noticed those numbers on the walls of odd floors? Well, I’m on floor “∋∰” according to those. I don’t know how that happened. I didn’t track floors first, because why would I, right? It’s getting cold here. If I look up or down it’s just endless number of stairs and this yellow electrical light, before everything gets swallowed by dim darkness. My throat hurts. I can’t cry anymore. Tears won’t come out. I never believed in any of the gods, but what’s if this is purgatory? Limbo? Am I being judged? Just what the fuck is happening with me? Maybe I’m in a coma, cause I fell down and hurt my head? What’s real? It’s getting colder as I follow down…*“

&#x200B;

This somebody really knew what kind of reading I would require closer to midnight on Friday’s night. I won’t lie - something pinched me from inside. I’ve almost instinctively tried the exit door on the floor. Closed. 

“Stop being a little bitch, Simon”- I’ve said to myself - “that’s just alcohol speaking in you. And, let’s admit it - somebody sure knows how to play a prank, okay?” Just 7 floors left. So I rushed down in a quicker manner.

That was my mistake, as believe it or not - the thing I was avoiding just happened - leaving me sitting on my butt, sending my briefcase flying down the stairs. I’ve quickly grabbed myself together, raising on the feet and dusting my pants off. 

My trustworthy briefcase was lying just close to exit door, next to what seemed a jacket and several sheets of papers covered in same clumsy handwriting. The joke was still on me. I was almost expecting, that somebody in a cheap Grim Reaper costume was waiting for me behind the exit door on the ground floor. Maybe my colleagues decided to celebrate with making me shit myself? What if Georgia’s attention was a part of this messed up plan? 

&#x200B;

I’m a rational man, I don’t believe in ghosts, monsters, mysterious lights and such bullshit. So I’ve stacked the papers on the ground and kept reading. I wouldn’t let those bastards see me spooked. 

“\[some text is smudged here\], *which means - no more liquid. I’m just going to leave it here. Strange, but I’ve swallowed the whole bottle already and my mind is crystal clear. I don’t feel hunger anymore. And it’s not cold. I think it’s getting warmer. You know what? My body can’t tolerate this constant rubbing from my bra anymore. I think I’ll leave it here too. Ah, that’s much better.* 

*If you’re still reading this - you might be sharing same tragic fate. What I know so far is:*

*1. It doesn’t matter if you go up or down from here - this won’t change anything.*

*2. Physical objects behave strange here. If you put something out of sight - it may (or may not) reset to a state before you took it out. This is how I lost first three drafts of my notes - putting it back into my purse led to blank sheets. And this is why my lipstick never ends.*

*3. If you hear a door opening below - don’t rush down. Listen. If you hear some chomping and gurgling - don’t make a sound.*

*4. Opposite to that: if you hear a door opening above you and no other sound produced - run for your life.*“

&#x200B;

I’ve switched to the next page:

“*I don’t know how much time has passed. I don’t need to sleep, my cellphone is dead and I feel no thirst or hunger anymore. Judging from my shoes, which already have  shabby soles - I’ve walked quite a lot. Today I’ve noticed a hole in a wall. It’s not larger than a dime and goes deep inside the concrete. I’ve tried to peep in, but it’s complete darkness inside.* 

&#x200B;

*…The holes are everywhere. They are covering the walls. I feel like I’m walking down a colander. Still can’t see through…*

&#x200B;

*…they elongate. Turning to drop-shaped openings, or how would I describe it? It’s getting hotter. I’d better leave my jacket here. Anyways, it’s starting to tear apart. I think my nervous system can’t bare this anymore. I’m starting to hear weird sounds, as if they are in my head. Clicking, whispering, sucking*

&#x200B;

*…these hole-like things… They keep elongating, becoming thinner, as I step down. Forming a pattern. I sense a strong smell of wet mold in the air. I am going crazy.*“

&#x200B;

And finally, the last page reads:

“*…these things on the walls… They keep pulsating. They look just like stretch marks. But in disgusting yellowish-purple-green colors. Is this hell? Am I gone? Please, just make it stop already. My feet are bleeding. Bring me to an end. Please.*

&#x200B;

*…I can’t see a foot before me because of all this light. The skin on her palms feels so soft to my bare shoulders. She says that I don’t belong here but I am welcome anyways. The blobs on my skin resonate to her soft wail. We are one. Weareone. Weaone. Wone. We…*\[the last two or three lines come absolutely unreadable\]*“*.

&#x200B;

I suddenly realized that my whole body is covered in cold sweat. Call me a coward, a fool or a very immersive reader, but this definitely hit some spots. I calmed down my breath, understanding that the last effects of alcohol are gone, leaving me alone to the situation. 

What happened next would be rather comical, if you’d watch it from aside - I heard the door above opening with no further sounds produced. No steps, no talking, not even cloth rustling. 

&#x200B;

At that very moment, in my body of a regular office clerk, who’d just read something disturbing in the night irrational overcame the rational and the “hit or run” instinct kicked in. So without waiting a mere second I rushed downstairs with all my speed, jumping over the steps. I didn’t care anymore if I would be acknowledged as a sissy or a coward by my pranking colleagues. I slammed the exit door and…

Nothing. Nobody was waiting me in the hall. No phone cameras recording, no laughs, no humiliation. 

Just the security guy at his panel, looking at me, as if I was a lunatic in the middle of the night.

&#x200B;

My heart pounded like a V8 engine at the top speed. Adrenaline tore me apart. But somehow I got a grip of myself. I was still clenching the handwritten papers in one hand, though my briefcase was still lying there, somewhere on the 6th floor.

“Fuck it” - I’ve said to myself. That was too much to bear for one night. 

Almost a month has passed since that night. I’ve got the desired promotion and still work for the same company. Oh, cleaners returned my briefcase, by the way.  I’ve asked around if anybody knew that Amanda girl and to no surprise - nobody ever heard of her. Though Jones & Co Legal are indeed located on the 21st floor. I’ve even paid them a visit, but again - no record of that person ever working with them.

&#x200B;

Apart of that - I’ve talked to the security officers of the tower and it happens, that they lock down the stairwell exits intentionally. As they say: “to prevent trespassing and stealing equipment from the offices, if somebody finds a way past us”. They say that they keep those doors locked from around 23:00 to 6:00 in the morning and demand office managers to inform them if somebody’s working late.

&#x200B;

I still have an irrational fear of stairs. Not only in this building, no. In general. Yeah, you can call me a fragile snowflake, whatever. This just cut too deep, you know. I’ve seen multiple therapists and all I got was - “Yes, sometimes new phobias can emerge due to some negative experience and you must overcome that…”.

Sure. Sounds simple and useless. I can’t tell this to my co-workers, as they will think I’m nuts. Can’t go to police, because what? I have couple of papers with fiction?

&#x200B;

And I would let it go and just accept my phobia if it wasn’t what I witnessed today. 

&#x200B;

It was 17:03 and people started to get clothed and proceed to the elevator with me standing in there, being the guy who pressed the call button. There were like 17 of us already, when our intern, Josh, walked out the reception room. He took a look above our heads, put his eyebrows together and went towards the door to the stairs.

And as he did - I felt ill. The blood started pumping in my temples and I felt shortness of breath. As when he opened the door and walked in, without raising his eyes from the screen of his phone, in a quick glimpse I saw it - concrete walls of the stairwell, covered in multiple elongated crevices, as if forming some sort of sickening pattern. Then the door slammed behind him.

&#x200B;

I took a week off next day and I don’t know what to do…

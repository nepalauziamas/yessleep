So a [few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v863ff/im_scared_to_leave_my_room_at_night/) now I shared with you all my wonderful nightlife of barely getting any sleep because of a weird cat sounding thing meowing and clawing at my door, it wasn't that bad and was pretty manageable until I tried recording it and it damn near broke my door down.

I have some updates.

First off, some of you suggested I bring a friend or family over so they can see what I'm going through. I'm shutting that down right now, ain't no way in hell am I risking someone else getting hurt by whatever that THING is until I know more about it, preferably a way to get rid of it.

Another fun little bump is I checked the listings on my complex (there's still 1 or 2 units they're trying to rent out) and it seems the price bumped a couple hundred from what it was when I was being shown the apartment and my rent hasn't changed at all, this might make sense if the units were different but they're all essentially clones of each other so I don't get why my rent would be lower?

I DID decide to take your advice and talk to my landlord, when I asked her about weird noises or something that may be getting into the apartments she looked surprised before brushing me off, told me it must be in my head and suggested I get more sleep as she didn't hear anything (her apartment is right below mine). I obviously didn't trust her and brought up my rent being lower than the new listings and she brushed it off saying she'd been wanting to raise the unit price since she inherited the complex but hadn't gotten around to it and would feel bad if she bumped the price on old tenants.

Asking my neighbours what they paid in rent shot that idea down almost immediately after our conversation, I was talking to my next door neighbour on our porches when I brought the subject up because I was doubtful of that story and nope, he's paying the higher price that was being advertised right now and I suspect I don't have to ask my other neighbours if they were paying the higher price as well.

Finally, I made the worst mistake of my life. I ordered some hidden cameras, all things I could hide in a place they wouldn't be easily visible or if visible they wouldn't be obviously cameras and made sure that all of them streamed to my laptop which I kept locked in my room and had them being recorded

Once they finally arrive I hooked them up immediately, my set up was 2 in my living room and 1 in the hallway in front of my bedroom (I have a bookshelf at the end of the hall that I put it in) I didn't know if it ever left the front of my door but if it was coming in from outside it would have to go through my living room to get to my door and I could record it scratching the door.

I immediately knew something was wrong, when it finally showed up it was...screechier? I don't know if that makes sense but it sounded angrier, the scratching on my door felt more like scraping and it was slow and hard on it. Eventually it stopped I could still hear the screeching but it sounded as if it was pacing and...sniffing? I had decided not to look at the cameras while they were recording, I'm not entirely sure why but my gut reaction told me I should wait until morning, like it would know if I was watching it and I think I might have been right because the worst happened.

It found one of the cameras, I don't know which one as they were all hidden pretty well (One was a fake cactus I had sitting on my coffee table, one was in a book which I thought was very clever and the final one was like this charger wall plug disguised thing I found on amazon, p cool) and it went wild. It was screaming so loud my ears hurt, I tried covering my ears with everything eventually ending up just hiding in my closet and it still felt like someone was shouting in my ear, my neighbours would HAVE to be hearing this there's no way they couldn't have, I don't know how long this lasted I ended up hiding in my closet to try and put more space between me and the noise.

Then the banging started and more scratching, but not on my door, I couldn't tell *where* it was happening if not my door but I could hear the walls tearing and stuff being smashed in the front rooms. I ain't gonna lie and say I bravely left my room to defend my Xbox because I didn't, I sat in my bedroom and started to freak the fuck out, I messed up so bad and thought that it would smash down my door and tear my guts out, obviously I knew it didn't like being recorded but this was so much worse than with the phone. Was it upset I was trying to hide it?  Did it understand what I was trying to do?

Damnit if only I knew WHAT this stupid thing was, and I've looked! A lot, but there's so much conflicting information it could literally have been one of a million things at this point from dozens of different cultures and I wasn't about to start trying *everything* cause that would take forever, I just wanted a picture to stick with my research.

This lasted for a few hours before it stopped and I heard nothing, it had to have been I dunno, 2-3 am? I didn't check, eventually I worked up the courage to leave my closet and that's when I realized there was crying coming from my door, it was very soft but I was positive it was coming from my door. I ended up sitting beside my door and listening to it, it sounded distraught and sounded like it was doing that heavy hiccup cry you do when you're just bawling. Honestly I was almost tempted to open my door and start trying to console it when my front door started banging and it stopped.

My heart sank, I never had someone come by when it was here (why would they, it's like 3 am) and I didn't know what it would do, would it attack them? Could it leave the apartment? Was my room somehow special in being able to stop it from coming in? But no, I didn't hear it do anything, and after a couple moments another knock came and I bravely (I was shaking like a wet cat and ready to slam my door shut) opened my door to go answer the front one and it was gone.

My whole apartment was trashed, there were gouges along all the walls, long deep lines cut into the walls wildly all along hallway leading into my living room, my door somehow sustained the least damage it's scratched something fierce but none of the cuts were particularly deep. And I don't even want to get started on my living room, needless to say I need a new TV and couch.

Opening my door, it was my landlord saying she was here investigating a noise complaint before pushing me into my apartment and closing the door behind, she proceed to (as quietly as she could shout) demand if I tried to record it, she looked terrified and on the verge of tears. When I asked her what the hell she was taking about she pointed to my now thoroughly thrashed living room and asked me what the fuck I thought she was talking about.

But I had her, she mentioned it and she couldn't deny it's existence anymore. I said yes and asked what the hell it was and why she lied to me about it.

After we stood there for a moment, neither of us budging she let out a sigh and told me everything.

She inherited the complex from her grandfather a few years ago after he passed away with instructions that she had to live in the building, his will specified this apartment but the thing terrified her and kept her awake at night so she eventually moved into the apartment below it and has been trying to rent it out at a lower price to try and get literally anyone to stay, supposedly I've lasted longer than most and they usually go running after a month.

She claims she has no idea what it is or how to get rid of it but it doesn't like people seeing it or knowing what it looks like, it especially hates pictures or videos being taken of it, she tried it a handful of times herself before eventually moving out.

Finally she mentioned a journal her grandfather had given her where he had kept notes about whatever it was, I obviously asked if I could read it and after some gentle prodding and promising that I wasn't going to run screaming out of the apartment with the journal one night she relucted and went downstairs to grab it.

So, now here I sit, the Journal is beside my laptop as I write this and the footage is still saved on it and I could watch it an any point but I'm terrified of opening the video and don't think I'm going to, not at least until I know more about this thing and can guarantee my own safety, maybe I can find a way to kill it or banish it or...I don't know just get RID of it. 

The closest I've gotten to watching it is just staring at the thumbnail, it's like fate it tempting me because one of the videos decided to make **it** the preview, not fully viewable or anything but it looks like it was trying to cover itself while lunging at camera, from what little I can make of it it looks thin, like its skin is starting to stretch over its bones and its eyes, deep yellow eyes staring at me whenever I open my folders to look at it.

I haven't read the Journal yet either, I've been delaying doing it since the thing is...well I have no other way of putting it. It's missing, it's been a week since this all happened and it hasn't come back, not once.

I'm worried, it seemed so sad last time it was here and I feel like I betrayed it somehow, I hope it comes back. I've been leaving a sandwich outside my room every night as a sort of....I dunno a peace offering?

I want to know more.

I NEED to know more.

I will find out what this thing is and...I don't know, do SOMETHING.

Weirdly I've had a harder time falling asleep without it than with it lately.

Stay safe, and sleep well.

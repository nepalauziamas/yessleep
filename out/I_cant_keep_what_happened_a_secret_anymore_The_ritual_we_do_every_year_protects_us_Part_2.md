I can’t sleep. The lights keep me awake at night; a dull orange glow pulsating on and off. On. And off. Constantly burning away the shadow from my window, then letting me drown in darkness—over, and over again. I don’t like the dark as much as I used to anymore. It almost feels like I’m not alone when the shadows of the night wrap their cold fingers around me. 

And the buzz. The piercing white noise of electrical current flowing through dim lightbulbs. For months my decorations have been… safeguarding me. I don’t know if I’m crazy, but I know the ritual must continue. I can feel it in my heart. There has to be a reason to why we do these things.

Don’t you ever wonder?

It’s nearly been a full year and I can’t get what happened out of my mind. Celebrating Halloween every day has definitely taken a toll on my personal life, I haven’t gotten laid since… fuck it. I’m still alive. Besides, I can’t even get it up anymore. Waste of time anyway. 

At first, I just left my decorations up. I just tried to pass it off as some lazy fuck that was too preoccupied with “work” to do anything about it. Christmas was interesting, though. I put up little knickknacks from that one movie—you know the one. The film with that dumbass skeleton who finds a doorway into “Christmas land” or some shit; all the characters had their own little spot on my lawn. Guardians. The neighbors loved it. The kids loved it. And I hated the attention.

It’s funny… I don’t like kids. I never have—the little shits. But ever since I’ve started this routine, I always find someone’s squirt standing within view of my house, just looking in awe. It’s annoying… But at least I’m safe. 

I’m sure they all think I’m a little off. But they don’t know. They don’t know shit. They haven’t seen the things I’ve seen. Yellow light dimmer and more twisted than the deepest places in hell. Dead, bloodshot eyes caked with tears, horror and pumpkin flesh; trapped in eternal torment, watching their final moments over, and over, and over again… And those poor girls. That smile. I can’t even sleep anymore. 

After that night, I just stopped going to work. I stopped answering all my phone calls—I stopped everything. Time stopped. 

Eventually, the agency did a wellness check on me. The big heads decided to send in a shrink to see if I still had all my nuts and bolts, but mostly because it’s just standard procedure. They don’t care about us, they just care about appearances. Just another pony show with all the bells and whistles. I knew they would. I’ve been on the force long enough to know what would happen, and I was hoping it would be some tight young fox with a problem finding clothes in the appropriate size. A man can dream, right? I’m not that fuckin’ crazy. 

Instead, they sent some hotshot poindexter fresh out of college, he didn’t stand a chance… but I got my goddamn pension out of it. And it gave me more time to focus on finding that damn thing… and killing it. Like I should’ve done the first time. 

Even though I left the force, you know how the saying goes, you can’t teach an old dog new tricks. I kept up with the case, getting bits of information here and there from old cop buddies. I’ve also been doing my own investigating, it’s not like I had anything better to do with my time. 

They never did find the husband though. But I feel like I saw him… not him, but… I could’ve sworn the damn thing was wearing his body like a goddamn costume. Not like a mere skin suit, but all of him; flesh, bone, muscle and sinew—everything. Neatly pulled over it’s aberrant form, made to look like we do. I remember as it shuffled off into the forest, I could’ve sworn I heard it screaming… laughing—bones breaking from the twisted angles of its grotesque movements… I don’t even think it let that poor man die. Or at least… nevermind. 

Sigh… of course they blamed him. He was the number one suspect. All the news outlets hinting at it being the father, wanted posters disguised as missing fliers. But I know better. I know the tricks of the trade all too well. And, it was fairly obvious… everyone thought it was him anyway. But I know the truth, I was there.

After I gained the courage, I went back to the scene of the crime a few times. Not the house—the old woods—Nightenberry Grove. Discarded candy wrappers littered the edge of the place, it wasn’t like the city took care of the old woods anyway. Garbage was everywhere in there. It looked like a landfill had taken root at its edge and was trying to force itself inward, trash being pushed up from beneath the ancient soil; slowly growing out like hungry weeds with rust for pollen, and broken glass for thorns. Nearly impenetrable. 

The weird thing about it though, is that all year round, it seems to always have fresh candy wrappers blowing around in there. Sort of like the fallen leaves from dead trees in a dying thicket—it really lends to the mysterious nature of the place. And that old poem that elderly people tell to children to keep them from going in and getting lost… maybe there’s more to it than it being a simple rhyme… 

“In Nightenberry Grove there is no life

No crickets chirping, no birds a flight

Only in silence, it comes at night

Sweets for the maw

Nowhere to run, no way to fight

No tricks to play, just wrongs to write

Give it treats, or lose your life

No way to run, no place for light”

Stupid poem… soon, I’ll make my way in there. I guess it can’t hurt to have a pocket full of candy. Halloween is only a few months away.

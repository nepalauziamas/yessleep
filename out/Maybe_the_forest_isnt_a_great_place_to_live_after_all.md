I bought my new home about  a year and 8 months ago in a secluded forest far away from anyone bothering me. As a child, I was the type to prefer a trip to the mountains rather than a beach with hundreds of people, you know? I preferred to keep to myself and read a nice book.  Anyways, After a huge stroke of luck I won the lottery. Friends and family were all wondering what is would do with my money and were shocked when I decided to buy a quaint home in the forests of Montana. I know it sounds weird but it was the perfect place for me and my dog to live. It was tough living in an area where crime was rampant and especially for the dog. He has a lot of energy and needs many walks and it was hard on both of us.

 Upon arrival, everything was perfect. No annoying neighbors, and plenty of space for the dog to run and have fun. The house was far from the road and featured a great view off of the balcony. the house is on a hill, but not on top of the hill. This is important. The first year and a half were great! everything was according to plan, and I was feeling better than i ever had, and then, it started. in probably late October or early November, I had let my dog out rather late \~9:00/9:30 P.M.  I went up to my room and expected to hear him at the door. Instead, I heard violent barking followed by a loud cry from my dog. I was terrified to see what happened to him but i had to go see. I opened the door and he bolted in and hid as if he were being chased. I looked around to see what had scared him but did not see anything. I figured it had been and animal. I was wrong. I checked on my dog to see what happened but he did not have any major cuts, Just a small cut on his side. Whatever he saw scared him more than anything, still, I took him to the vet and they said an animal had probably attacked him but he was fine.

About two weeks later, I would figure out what really happened to my dog. 

I have a habit of taking night-time walks if i have trouble sleeping. On this particular night, I just could not sleep. I had an intense fear of something and decided I should take a walk. By now, it was pitch dark outside, I mean no light at all. Not to mention is was freezing and snowy, but I still decided to go anyway. I put on my coat and slipped out. I walked out into the forest for a while hoping I would feel better but it got worse. I had a very intense feeling of being watched. I decided to turn around and i have a good sense of direction and wasn't to far out so I could do it, But because of my fear, I was having trouble. and then I heard something. The most terrible sound I ever heard.I heard something walking fairly close. I started running as fast as I could. I had a sudden burst of adrenaline and ran to where i thought my house was. Whatever that thing is, I could hear it running after me making an awful sound somewhere between a growl and a high pitched scream Thankfully i made it back to the house. But to my horror, it was fairly smart. I had all the doors locked except for the balcony door, And  it began to run up the hill. Whatever it was has clearly more athletic than any human could ever be and managed to jump onto the balcony. I rushed to hide myself and the dog and when I did, i got in. It quickly came into my view and I saw it clearly. It had long claws, and fairly tall standing at around  6 foot 3 inches and muscular. It almost resembled a human but was too grotesque to be one. it immediately triggered the response you have to those movies they look human but not quite, Uncanny Valley I think. Thankfully, it left.

I don't know what to do. My perfect life in my new home was ruined by a creature stalking my house trying to get me and my dog. I currently can't even leave as we are snowed in and that thing is most certainly waiting for us.

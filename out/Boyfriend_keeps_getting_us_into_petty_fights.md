The arguing I’ve endured is over such idiotic things. 

“When did you say you wanted to meet?”
“We were supposed to meet over an hour ago.” 
“You said eleven” 
“No I said 10, when will you fucking begin to actually appreciate me.”

It’s getting so annoying. 

“Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realize that my body isn’t good enough for you.”
“I never fucking said that, I’m not feeling it tonight.” 
“YOU’RE NEVER FUCKING FEELING IT. WHEN WILL YOU GET IT IN YOUR PATHETIC MIND THAT I DO SO MUCH FOR YOU.” 

I wish he understood how much I did for him.

“I have been working my ass off FOR YOU.” 
“What work? You sell yourself, something I’ve told you makes me uncomfortable.” 
“Do you think I want to? You make me do this, you don’t satisfy me then expect me to stay loyal to you. I think it’s a fair deal if you’re expecting me to pay FOR YOUR FUCKING APARTMENT.” 
“How does that even make sense?”

This was our last argument.

“You can’t tell me to do fucking shit.” 
“I will kill you if you walk out.”
“No you fucking won’t, you’re a pussy. A psychotic cunt.” 
"Wait I'm sorry, genuinely, this isn't how I want things to end."
"Oh God, common. Do you really think I'm going to buy into this shit? Every single damn time this happens it's the same thing. The same promises, over and over again."
"Baby, I know, you know how much work has been stressing-"
"Holy shit, yeah, work that I asked you VERY respectfully not to do."
"But you can't expect me to do everything you ask from me, your expectations are insane." 
"I'm asking you to not fuck other guys and then hand me cash as if I asked it from you."
"What have we been able to do with that money though? We have a home, we have all these nice things."
"If I recall, I got us those things."
"Oh here you go again, pretending as if I'm some sort of monster." 
"YOU- I never said that once, you're telling me things that simply aren't true." 
"How do you know if they're true or not? Do you have proof? How are you sure it isn't your depression-"
"You need to shut up."
"I'm just trying to say-"
"YOU NEED TO SHUT UP. NOW."
"Fine, then go. Just go, see where you'll fucking end up." 
"I was going to grab a drink at the bar, too. But honestly, fuck you."
"Wait where are you going now? Fucking answer me. ANSWER ME. YOU INCONSIDERATE ASSHOLE. You know what all those guys tell me? They tell me I should leave you, you're a fat pig anyways."
"You can keep smacking my back, that's not doing anything for you." 
"GOD I HATE YOU. YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT. I HATE YOU."
"I'm closing the door."
"I HATE YOU-"
"Stop. Those are my things, give them to me."
"YOU'RE WORTHLESS- HEY-"
"You fucking idiot."
"DON'T TOUCH ME."
"Jesus Christ- PUT THAT DOWN, THIS ISN'T FUNNY BRO-"

The weather is amazing here. I hated the warmth.


(I want to make a series based off this if it goes well)

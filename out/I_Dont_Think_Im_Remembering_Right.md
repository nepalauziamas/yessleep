Oh hey! Somewhere that still has internet! It hasn’t happened here yet! I got a warning for everyone. It always happens eventually. My username is attached to a site called “Reddit” which I’ve never seen before but apparently “nosleep” is my favorite sub? I’m gonna post this here.

Have you ever picked up an old movie you used to love and watched it again, only to get confused when something doesn’t seem quite right? They say our memory doesn’t always ‘record’ things correctly, which means when we think about a scene in a movie in our head, it might not be the same one that plays out on screen.

The first time it happened to me was like that. It was really subtle, and I was really young. This was back in the nineties of course, so you Gen Z folk probably can’t relate. But anyway. I had seen The Empire Strikes Back before. When I was really little, I wasn’t really into it. Sure, the story isn’t that hard to follow. Fight the space fascists, use space magic, watch out for space monsters, but at that age I just couldn’t get into it like my family could. The one way it did hold my attention was in its monsters (that’s why I’ll always like Return of the Jedi best, fight me). I love monsters. Godzilla is my favorite, but in Empire, I particularly loved the big space worm that appears on an asteroid and lunges after the escaping Millennium Falcon. 

When I sat down to watch Empire again with my family for only the second time in my memory, I sat in rapt attention waiting for the big space worm to make its appearance. When it finally did, I was so confused. Many of you have probably seen it. This big worm sticks its head out of a hole and chomps at the air. That was the same, but the WAY it lunged seemed completely different than the scene that played out in my head. In my head, the camera is angled down more, and the worm strikes almost like a snake, lunging up from the pit from low to high (relative to the camera I mean, I know, it’s in space) and it’s big glassy teeth close inches away as the Falcon zooms off to the right. What actually happens on screen though, the camera stays far back and low, making the worm look big, and it just sort of slinks out of the hole in a sort of crescent shape and chomps at the air while the Falcon flies off to the left. 

Immediately I shouted at my parents “this isn't the same! It’s a different movie!” I was convinced of it. But it wasn’t. Eventually my mom figured it out and explained how sometimes the way we remember things can be slightly different from what they are. Our memory can play tricks on us. Everyone else had the same problem with whether or not Han Solo shot first in the cantina of the first Star Wars. I don’t know about that one. I’ve seen both. So are some of us remembering wrong? Or did we actually see something different? It turns out, Lucas released different cuts, so depending on which one you saw, both are true. Sometimes Han shot first. Sometimes Greedo did and Han returned fire. Either way a lot of us were left wondering what it was we remembered.

I took that lesson to heart. Sometimes we remember things differently. That’s how I explained a lot of the things in my life, back then. I swear it happens to me WAY more than anyone else though. I was diagnosed with ADHD pretty young (they called it ADS back then, Attention Deficit Syndrome. I guess now it’s just Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, but whatever) and put on meds. They helped me focus on tasks, but never seemed to help me retain anything.

My childhood was relatively normal but I could never shake the feeling that I was living somewhere slightly different to everyone else. What solidified it was when my old best friend and I celebrated his birthday. Our favorite show in the universe was Super Skater Snakes. Yeah, I know, it was a total Ninja Turtles rip off, just like Biker Mice, or Captain Simian, but for us it was all about the Snakes. My favorite was the hulking snake, Buster Boa, and his, was the leader Pythune. But anyway, at his birthday party, I got my best friend a toy snake. It was this cool rubber thing painted like a python. I knew he’d love it, because it was just like Pythune. The one girl in class was supposed to bring him one that looked like Vera Viper. So he’d have half of his own set of Skater Snakes.

I was really confused when I got to the party and the whole thing was Shark themed. He even had a Poster of these Sharks with legs called the Street Sharks. I had to admit, they looked pretty cool, but what happened to the Skater Snakes poster? I kept quiet until it was time to open presents. I was all excited, waiting for him to see his Python.

But instead, everyone at the party got scared when my friend screamed. Apparently he was scared of snakes. They even made me leave the party for playing a cruel trick. My parents got an angry phone call and everything. The next day at school though, he slapped me on the back and told me I was the best friend ever for getting him that toy snake. He then wondered why I didn’t seem to remember participating in the party games I wasn’t there for. All the other kids seemed to remember I was there too. 

Even weirder? The day after that, he walked up to me and told me he forgave me for the snake. He knows sometimes I forget things, and I probably forgot when he told me that he had a phobia.

I just kind of stopped talking about that birthday party. A few years later I asked about it. He said he still had his favorite snake somewhere. Who the hell knows. Nobody remembers Skater Snakes anymore. 

Then this other time, me and this girl I was friends with got into this big shouting match, because we both saw a movie. She said it was called Kazaam and starred Shaq, the basketball player as a Genie. “That’s stupid! Shaq isn’t an actor! It’s called SHA-zam, and it starred Sinbad.” We argued so loudly our teacher had to separate us. Later I learned that KA-zam with Shaq was a thing, but I knew Shazam was too. Other kids saw the genie movie with Sinbad. So we were both right… I think. Not everyone seems to remember Shazam. I even saw a video interview on YouTube where Sinbad himself says he never made a Genie movie called Shazam. I have no fucking clue what to make of that, but at least I’m not alone there. There’s definitely other people who swear they’ve seen Shazam.

My life seems chock full of moments like this. I remember so many things happening that everyone else remembers differently. I legitimately thought my entire high school class was in on some elaborate prank against me. I was known as the kid with memory trouble, so maybe they all agreed to screw with me? I went to a smaller school, it didn’t seem that unlikely. They’d tell me things like “Lindsay Lohan never won an Oscar” or “Godzilla won at the end of 1962 ‘King Kong vs Godzilla” or “‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ starred Johnny Depp and  Orlando Bloom” (who the fuck is Johnny Depp?) and I would just smile and nod nervously, not sure if they were serious. I fucking WISH I remembered Godzilla winning in that movie. A lot of the time I can’t even remember the American presidents. I don’t think I’ve ever taken a history course that matched what I thought I’d learned in the last one. Was Kennedy shot? Or was Nixon? What the hell actually happened in Cuba? I just don’t fucking know. You kinda just learn to roll with it. 

But anyway, I hoped maybe college would be different. Nobody I knew went there. It was a clean slate and a fresh start. If my issues were a prank, they couldn’t follow me there. But guess what? People still didn’t ever know what the fuck I was talking about. I asked some friends if they wanted to play Guitar Hero or something and they’re like “what the hell is Guitar Hero?” So im like “it’s that super popular game (right now) with the big silly plastic guitar controller?” Blank stares. Two days later the same people invited me to a Guitar Hero 2 release party. Then I see some other friends watch “21 Kids and counting” and I asked “didn’t the elder Duggar molest his sisters or something?” Which got me a lot of blank horrified stares. Next day, I ask why they aren’t watching their show and they’re like “why would I watch those cultists with their creepy son?” This wasn’t just people screwing with me. ‘My brain must be utterly broken,’ I thought. 

So that’s me in a nutshell. I never know what’s real anymore. I thought maybe I had something more severe than ADHD. I learned to just keep rolling with it. If I just keep nodding, everyone’s happy. 

But later, I started to wonder if something more was happening. I never feel like the world I’m living in is the same one I remember being in. But some of the discrepancies are super hard to ignore. I remember reading news articles that mention ‘President Trump,’ and he’s usually acting like a freaking Nazi. But here’s the thing, I clearly remember Clinton winning in 2016. My girlfriend (at the time) and I got completely shitfaced in utter relief because we knew that a loud-mouthed bankrupt (multiple times) reality-star wouldn’t be leading the country on the back of its racist underbelly, but every so often, I’ll wake up, check the news, and Trump has made daily headlines for fucking things up AS PRESIDENT, rather than just being a sore loser. Sometimes it’s because he lost and claims that the election was stolen. Sometimes it’s because he won and he’s an unstable lunatic in charge of nukes. Either way, I couldn’t fucking escape it. Some people say he lost to Biden in 2020 and tells anyone who will listen that that election was stolen too. He’s always a crybaby when I hear about him. 

That couldn’t just be my fucked up brain, could it? That’s a pretty major difference and I have such vivid memories.

I read about a theoretical phenomena called the Mandela Effect. It’s named after Nelson Mandela the South African anti-apartheid activist. There was this point when he was jailed, and like, a TON of people swear they remember seeing reports that he died in prison. But that never happened. He went on to become president of South Africa. But some swear he died earlier and are all shocked and confused. I’m sitting there in a corner thinking “pfft, amateurs. Welcome to my damn life.” So a lot of people wondered why so many remembered something different and thought up a bunch of theories. Maybe it’s something ‘normal’ like a collective delusion, or reinforced false memory. 

More out-there theories involve multiverse theory. Like where there’s an infinite number of universes and some of us might experience memories from other universes where things are slightly different or some shit. 

Honestly, that one makes sense to me. Maybe that’s why details never seem to make sense in my head. I’m experiencing different events in a different universe. I have no fucking clue how. I have no control over it. Sometimes I wake up and everyone remembers Shazam was a real movie, or Natalie Portman is the most beautiful and accomplished scientist in the world, or that Portal 4 is still the greatest game ever, or the Skater Snakes had been replaced with the Street Sharks or Biker Mice (sometimes both), Half-life 3 still hasn’t been released, and (tragically) Godzilla lost a fight to King Kong. But then I turn around and find myself in a world where nobody remembers chocolate super wheat cereal, Skater Snakes is getting a reboot series, lunatics run the American Government, and Valve stopped making Portal after the second one (I might have cried). 

I suppose I should be glad I never ended up in a universe where humanity never developed and earth is ruled by power hungry Ostrich’s or some shit. It’s always earth, it’s always humans, I’m always in English speaking America, but fucked if I could tell you what a lot of the individual details are on a day to day basis. But that hardly matters anymore. But that hasn’t happened here yet. So here’s your warning.

2021 has been relatively constant, no matter how many subtle things are different. It’s true that once or twice I’ve woken up in the bunker and nobody knew why the fuck I was there, because the invasion hadn’t started yet in the last year and a half, but most days I’m holed up with the survivors. We still don’t know what THEY are or where they came from, but be warned. THEY are coming. Also it might just be IT. Who the fuck knows. I remember when I first saw them in quite a bit of detail. In my head it was their first appearance, on Feb. 3rd, 2021. People I talk to usually give me different dates now, but they’re always there, or on their way. But anyway. 

I was on my lunch break and heading back across the street right in the center of town, when completely out of nowhere, this weird black mushroom thing just sprouted from the ground. Traffic came to a screeching halt and many people even crashed their cars to avoid it. It started as this big Dome that just rose up, flipping a car as it went. To the casual observer it might have appeared to be ‘growing’ straight out of the concrete of the intersection. But it wasn’t ‘growing.’ It wasn’t coming up from the ground. It didn’t disturb the road in the slightest. It was just… rising up. At its maximum height it was about twenty feet tall, about a meter thick, and very black, slimy, and phallic-looking.

We all watched in awe, wondering what the fuck was going on. I was maybe a hundred yards away from it at that point. The thing gave me bad vibes. I was totally right. As we watched a panel at the top of the thing slid open. Then the screaming started. We all recognized the thing inside the panel. It was orange, and alien, but unmistakable, it was an eye. An eye filled with malice and unknown intent. People began panicking. The eye rolled around in its black mushroom stalk, glancing at this and that. It seemed rather fixated on a billboard featuring Actress-turned-Politician, Cate Blanchette (who was running in opposition to Clinton’s proposed ban on dairy mills. Come to think of it… the fuck was up with that? Dairy mills?). After a few moments, that mother fucker looked right at me. I don’t mean just in my direction either. I stared into its black pupil, and it’s bizarre triangular pupils wobbled and contracted and I just knew they were zeroing in on me specifically. I took a step to the right, and it followed. “Fuck this.” I
Remember yelling. I ran the fuck away from the black eyestalk. My heart pounding in my ears the whole way. That thing SAW me. That was bad. Very very bad. 

Supposedly the eyestalk sat there in the intersection for ten minutes, staring at the billboard before sinking back into the ground. It left no traces. No hole on the ground. It was like it just rose out of the road then disappeared back into it. Twenty minutes later, the invasion officially began. I had just made it back to my work place. I barely stopped for breath the whole time. The memory of that fucked up otherworldly eye gazing at me just filled me with raw panic. I was stopped over in front of my building, hands on my knees, desperate to catch my breath. A buddy of mine called my name and ran towards me from across the street. I managed to glance up at him. I was looking right at him. Then out of nowhere this thick slimy worm launched out of the ground, coiled around him, lifted him into the air as he tried to express shock, then pulled him out of sight. It only took about three seconds to finish, but man did it have an effect. Cars stopped, people shouted, one guy fell off of his bike. 

I couldn’t make sense of any of it at the time. I thought maybe a tentacle reached out of a sewer and grabbed my buddy before pulling him into it. But that wasn’t it. ‘Where the hell did my friend just go?’

Then more came. Writhing black appendages just reached out of any nearby surface, grabbed someone, and yanked them out of reality.

Whatever the things are, they seem to reach out of flat surfaces. There isn’t much of a pattern to it. They appear out of non-existent black holes on any flat surface, grab a nearby person, and yank them out of the universe and into… wherever the hell they come from. 

I’ve been surviving ever since. In some places you’ll see skyscrapers with dozens of these tentacles reaching out of the surfaces, feeling around, searching for prey, I guess.

I definitely recall the details of that first day. It was pure chaos. All over the world, these things appeared and took people away. Millions vanished that day alone based on ‘rough estimates.’ After that, I don’t know. I can never tell how far along the invasion is anymore. Sometimes half the world is gone, and sometimes the eyestalk has only just appeared. I’ve seen the eye like
six different times, and every time the bastard looks at me. I’m starting to wonder if it’s following me. Most people left don’t even know about the eyestalk, but I’ve seen it that many times? And it’s seen me? It’s the beginning. First the eye, then the tentacles. 

So uh… yeah. Watch out for those. If it’s following me, then it’ll be here at some point. Sorry about that, not really my fault though. They reached their slimy tendrils into our world and killed most of us before we knew we were at war. We don’t know if they came from space or underground, or somewhere else. If I’m slipping through the multiverse, my best guess is they’re something from like… between universes. But whatever they are, you’d best prepare yourself. I know that worldwide pandemic, global politics, and environmental disaster suck, but oh boy, something so much worse is on its way. There are certain places where they can’t seem to reach as of yet. Try to find those places. Some think they’re averse to the color red, but I kinda doubt it.

I don’t wanna talk about that though. We’re mostly safe in our bunker, trying to remember the better days. The days when all we cared about were Genie movies. Hell, I’d even take a world where that moron, Trump got everything he wanted and made racists really loud and obnoxious. At least we can fight that sort of thing. At least we still have a chance to heal the environment. 

Things don’t always happen how you think they should. Sometimes you realize the way you saw things was never the way they were. But our End is pretty universal. I don’t think we can stop what’s coming. So I guess, enjoy what time is left. There’s always the possibility that I just have a broken brain, and I just don’t remember things right. Either way, I’m gonna put on some old archived Natalie Portman YouTube vids, (holy shit, she’s an actress now too!!!!) eat some canned Squidro brand pork, and watch this new movie I found where Godzilla fights against Kong. I certainly don’t remember there being plans for “Godzilla vs. Kong,” in the last few years, but I found the dvd and took it with me. I swear, if Godzilla loses…

I usually never post on Reddit and I’m sorry my first submitted version wasn’t long enough. but I often come here and something is in my head that doesn’t let me sleep that night, I almost feel like I’m in shock. 

On summer days I usually go out in the forest very close to our village, there’s a nice road you can walk on with fields around you and a big entrance to the forest. 

I usually talk to my mom via FaceTime, because I like to share some time with her after a long day, and so I did it this day (yesterday) I was not deep inside the forest, like 200 meters, because it’s the point where I always turn around to go back home. 
I stood there, and got interrupted by a sound that sounded like a scream. But not the typical scream you would think of, more like an echo of a deep scream from miles and miles away. 

I could barely hear it myself, and was only able to because everything went quiet for a second. I wasn’t sure if I heard it right, but as soon as my mom asked me what that sound in the background was, I was covered in goosebumps because that wasn’t the first weird experience in that forest, and I couldn’t believe she found something was odd about it as well. It was almost like a loud, but still so silent whisper around my ears

I don’t know what it was and I’m really asking for thoughts from you guys, because I never heard that kind of powerful scream through the forest that reached that far. 

I’m aware of the echo system of trees but I could hear it start and end in a blink of an eye but yet so long. 

Just to give you some more information, the forest reaches between two cities that are around 20km from each other, and is about as spread. 

It covers around 3 different districts and has no one living inside like houses or retreats of some sort, and there are not that many trees as there used to be, because in our region of the country we had a long period of storms that caused most of the trees to fall and having to be cut down. 

It’s a German forest, so there’s lots of animals and i usually know the sounds of these animals, but this sounded like something that’s bigger than anything else, and not like the machines that work there at night to transport and cut down the trees, and I still don’t know how to feel about it. 

Thank you to anyone who might have an idea 

The reason that this is keeping me up late at that night is the fact, that a few years back I used to ride the bike with my friends through this forest. 

We always went out the whole day, riding the same roads inside the forest up and down. The thing is, that there’s one specific point of the road, where it has a small gap on the side of it, that you can look into about 100m into the forest, and it ends with another tree in at the end. 

The gap is around 5m wide, so there’s nothing much to see. One day I decided to go there on my own around 5pm, when the sun still was out. I rode my bike the little road inside the forest up and down. 


I went up a little hill on the road, when I saw someone bald with black clothes on walking out of the small gap of the forest I mentioned before. He noticed me and as soon as he saw me he started running towards me, while being around 40m away from me. 

The stupid (kind of cocky child I was) mocked him a bit and rode down the small hill, hit the brakes of my bike and watched him run after me. 

The moment I realised he was going faster, I pedalled the hell out of my bike and saw him coming up the hill I went down 10 seconds ago. 

I was at the end (now exit) of the forest and saw watching me ride away and afterwards walk inside the forest again. 

And sorry if I spelt something wrong, English is not my first language

So to start off, I work for Child Protective Services. I deal with families and kids every single day. Ive been working here for 6 years but never in that time have i dealt with a case like this. 

The day started with me getting called into work on my day off. I was pissed off but I got ready and headed down to the office. I picked up the file left on my desk and read through it.

**Case file:**

**Name:** Stella Crest

**Age:** 13

**Reason for report:** possible sexual assault, physical abuse. Terrible living condition accoriding to reporter.

Ok, nothing out of the ordinary, I work with these types of cases all the time, I thought to myself. I headed over to the address given on the case file, but as I pulled into the driveway I immediately go an overwhelming feeing of dread. I had no clue why but I knew something was terribly wrong.  I walked up to the door and rang the bell, no answer. I rang it again... no answer. "hmm whats taking so long" i thought to myself. As i was about to ring the bell for the third time the door opened. A dirty looking woman stood infront of me. "Hi im Melissa, I work with CPS and im here to take an evaluation of the house to see the condition and also Interview your daughter Stella Crest" I said, my voice shakier than its ever been. "DANNY! a woman is here! Claims she works with CPS" the woman screamed back into the house. A few seconds later a man who looked like he hadn't slept in 5 days came to the door. "Why are ya here?" he asked. "Im Melissa, I work with CPS and im here to evaluate the living conditions in this home and interview your daughter Stella Crest" I told him. He scrunched his face but welcomed me inside. As I walked into the house, my nose was filled with the smell of rotting meat. "What is this smell?" I asked them. "We dont know what your talking about" The woman said, staring up at the man. After walking through the home I asked to see Stella. "Stella, a lady is here to speak with you" the woman screeched. A small and skinny girl slowly came out from behind the door. My  heart immediately shattered into a million pieces. 

"Hi Stella, Im Melissa and im here to speak to you today about your life and living situation" I said trying to plaster a fake smile across my face. "Hi, w-what do y-you want to ask?" she said, her voice trembling. "I would prefer to do this privatly, would you like to come sit outside with me so we can chat?" I asked her. "Yes please" she responded. Her parents looked furious at her response. 

"So, Stella How are you?" I asked, trying my best to stay as cheerful as possible. "Ive been better" she replied. "and why is that?" I asked. "My mum has been really mean to me recently, she throws knives and plates at me" she said, looking down at the dead grass. "Does she do anything else?" I asked while scribbling down everything she told me. "the other night she took out to the street corner and told me to try flirt with the men the pull up next to me. My mum said its how women get money" She said, tears forming in her beautiful green eyes. My fist tightened around my pen as she told me everything she went through. It was horrifying...

Here are some of the notes I took:

*- father sexually assaults stella as 'punishment'* 

*- mother has taught her how to be a prostitute*

*- fathers friends abuse Stella regularly*

*- mother throws plates and knives at stella on a daily basis*

*- School Maths teacher raped her in Handicap bathroom*

*- Stella has been locked to her bed and was forced to use her bed as a toilet for 6 months.*

*- Stella has a 6 inch cut on her left arm, 2 cms deep.* 

After speaking with Stella, I walked her back into the house and told her parents I will be back for another interview in a week. They said "whatever" and closed the door on my face. I immediately drove back to the office in tears. As I walked into the office everyone turned their head to me. I didnt care, I just went straight to my desk and called the police. My co-worker Alex came over and asked me whats wrong. "the house i just went to, the little girl! She cant stay there or else they will kill her!"

"111, what is the emergency?" The operator asked. "Hi im Melissa i work with CPS and Im reporting a severe case of child abuse and child rape" I said back. The operator asked for all the information and sent 3 police cars over to her house.

2 hours later I recieved a call from an Unknown number. It was the Police. "H-Hello?" I said. "Hi there is this Melissa Trinity?" the police officer asked. "Yes this is" I responded. "Hi there im calling you to let you know that the little girl you saw earlier today was murdered and we need you to come down to the station with any information you might possibly have" the offcier said. My heart broke. That poor 13 year old girl, killed because she wanted help. 

Stella was a precious little girl who didnt deserve the abuse and torture she recieved. I pray to Stella that she is happier now, in a safe place.

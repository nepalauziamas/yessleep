Ever since I was born mother has taken care of me. Father wasn’t in the picture. I had one sibling, Josh and he was younger than I was. When our grandmother died, mother was devastated. She went into a somewhat depressive state of mind where she didn’t take care of us too well. I was practically a mother to Josh. My name is Kelly and I’m 17 yo and Josh is 14 yo. Eventually mother got better with time and she took us all on a trip in the woods. She said she found a job there at a nearby small motel and that we would be staying at this house for awhile. We got to the house and it looked fairly old. 

The wood looked like it was almost decayed and the roof was starting to peel off. “Home sweet home” mother said. “Mhhm, yeah” said Josh. To be honest I was creeped out because we were in this cabin in the woods. When I went to bed that night, I head a strange sound almost like a shriek like something was in pain. I couldn’t sleep the rest of the night. The next morning mother said she had to work so I said ok and she left. Josh was in his room playing with his baseball when I said out to him that I was gonna go for a jog. I put my phone in my pocket and put my left air-pod in my ear. I started jogging along a trail when out of my right ear I heard some bushes rustling. 

“Hello?” I said, no answer. I continued jogging until my last straw was pulled. Out of the very corner of my eye I saw a tall figure. I don’t know how tall but surely taller than me, which I am 5’6. I hightailed it home without any thought. I would say that the time was around 4:00 pm and it was starting to get slightly dark. From upstairs, I heard a car pull into the drive way. “Mother” I thought. “Josh mother is home!” I yelled, no answer. “Josh, stop fucking with me I know your here!” I yelled again, and again no answer. I walked down the hallway and was immediately grabbed. “JESUS WTF JOSH!” I screamed. “Just wait I’ll explain later. Right now you just need to calm down and keep your mouth shut.” 

“Why?” I said. “Kelly you need to listen to me very carefully. Whoever, or whatever, pulled into that driveway is NOT mother.” “What? What do you mean?” I said. “That thing came here earlier and knocked on the door. I asked who it was and in mothers voice it said it was mother. But you see mother was at work and she said she wouldn’t be home until 5:00 pm. I ran up to my room and it unlocked the door. 

It came in asking where I was and when I didn’t answer it left. It’s back now and it knows we’re here no doubt.” I was in shock. “B-but ho-“ he cut me off in the middle of my sentence. “Shhhh.” he said. “It’ll be in here any minute. We cannot be seen.” 

The time was now about 4:15 pm when I heard it, a crash. Dinner plates, silverware, and the front door. Tears started to roll down my eyes while Josh stood quiet. That thing started trashing the house in search for us. I heard it, mother’s voice. But I knew it wasn’t mother, it can’t be. The time was now 4:30 pm. Mother will be home in 30 minutes. The thing sounded so much like mother I wanted to call out to it. We heard it stomp up the stairs. Tears were now streaming down my eyes when suddenly Josh coughed. 

The thing ran over to our door. I could hear it’s breaths as they got louder and louder. Suddenly it started banging on the door. “Kelly? My sweat angel come here!” “Mother? Is that you??” “NO” Josh said. “THAT THING IS NOT MOTHER! “ I saw a window, covered by boxes. “JOSH THERE’S A WINDOW, HELP ME UNBLOCK IT!” I said. That thing must’ve heard us because it started banging louder and louder until the door broke down. 

By that time the window was uncovered and open and I was outside. Josh however, was not. “JOSH HURRY! PLEASE” I cried out. But before Josh could even think, that thing grabbed him. “NOOO NO NO NO NO!” I said. “KELLY HELP ME, HELP ME KELLY!” he screamed. But there was nothing I could do. The time reached 4:50 pm. 

I ran and ran until I was exhausted. I couldn’t stop crying over the loss of my brother. That thing, I will never forget. When mother got home I ran out of the woods crying to her. “MOTHER, MOTHER IS THAT YOU?!” “YES BABY I’M RIGHT HERE, WHAT HAPPENED WHERE IS JOSH?!” “He, he, he’s gone, the monster took him” I explained everything to her with my eyes full of tears. She was devastated. There was no landline and we couldn’t call police. The only thing we could do was wait until morning and drive away from this shithole. 

When we got back into town we immediately went to the station and tried to explain what happened but of course no one believed us. We just filed a missing persons report in hope that somehow, someway, someday Josh would come home to us. Josh if your out there, mother and I have been waiting for you, come home sweetie.

As a researcher's assistant at a biological warfare facility, you'd hardly expect to see any free time. Not even on weekends, holidays, or even birthdays. So when I had the chance to get a day off, I took it. 

On my free Tuesday night, I walked into a place called "R&R Bar and Grille". I thought to myself that it'd be pretty tame, but I was more concerned about just slamming some alcohol in me. 

I sat at a bar across from the bartender and ordered a beer. We got to talking and he asked about my job. 

"Oh I'm just a research assistant at the university nearby," I lied, not trying to seem suspicious. 

"A researcher you say," asked the bartender, "you know there's a regular here that always sits and talks about some research gone bad at a local lab. You should talk to him and see if it makes any sense. Doubt it though," he laughed. 

He pointed the man out to me. He was holding a cigarette in one hand and a glass in the other, alternating between the two. He looked absolutely pitiful. A wrinkled white buttoned down shirt barely covering his muffin top, a baseball cap that had some wear and tear, and a scruffy beard that hadn't been washed in who knows how long. 

I walked up to the man and asked, "Hey sir, the bartender said you got good stories and you come here often. Mind sharing?" 

"Yeah I come here everyday," he spoke, "but only because of the incident with my family. I drink to forget and numb the pain, but I just can’t seem to get even a fraction of the way to covering the trauma. It was a few years ago when this happened. It was the scariest thing I ever experienced or will experience in my life. Buy me another beer and I'll tell you all about it if you are so curious." 

After hearing that introduction, I just had to hear the story. I bought the man a beer and waited. 

He cleared his throat really quick and took a big inhale. "I was 31 at the time and started a new job in Arizona. I don’t know what came over me, but I moved the whole family to the middle of nowhere in an old house. The only reason I did that was because the pay was substantial. My wife’s daughter at the time was 4 years old and both of my sons were 15 and 9 years old. My 26 year old wife and I both brought kids from separate relationships so we had to find a way to make a ton of money to support them. We were both going to work for this company called 53rd Testing Incorporated." 

My heart sank. That's the cover name the organization used to hire people to test on as a scheme before we sell our weapons to the military. I tried to not show any reaction as he continued his story. 

"We were told we would be testing several types of new insecticides, weed killers, and meat cleansing chemicals. That’s what scared me. The thought that something was in our food that could get us so sick it could kill us. The thought they use chemical warfare against these pathogens and people are still getting food poisoning. It scared me day and night, especially with new and more evolved forms of parasites." 

He took a long shaky pull of his cigarette before he started again. 

"Anyways, I arrived with my wife to the job and I was to test the durability of weeds using 5 weedkillers on the testing garden in the greenhouse. My wife had to test a new chemical that was used to clean chicken. She had to clean the infected chicken thoroughly and then she had to cook it and eat it. That test failed and she was sent home early due to rapid food poisoning. I didn’t think much of it at the time and they scolded me to continue testing until they had nothing else to use me for the day. They sent me home quite early, but I thought they didn’t want me to do too much on the first day. When I arrived home I witnessed my wife puking all inside the toilet. I felt bad so I picked the kids up from school so she wouldn’t have to. As I came home once more I saw she went to sleep so I prepared dinner for the kids and I. It never really occurred to me on how she fell asleep so quickly but I assumed she was tired. Just as I finished making dinner, she woke up as if she was a new person. H... her..." 

The man was getting anxious. I was drawn to the story even as his breathing became labored. I just had to listen. I beckoned him to tell me more. 

"Her eyes were glassy as if she was no longer alive or even human as if she was being controlled like an animatronic. Her skin was so white and rough. I assumed the food poisoning had something to do with her awkward behavior. She continued to walk to her seat and as soon as I set her plate down, work had called for me. They said it was urgent and they needed me as soon as possible, so I left." 

Tears built up in the man's eyes as his lips began to tremble. 

"As I drove the many miles to work I was thinking of what could have gone wrong especially at night and why do they need a testing dummy for it? Nevertheless, I hurried there and as soon as I got out of my car, two men in black suits grabbed me and pulled me inside the building. They said it was unsafe to go back home and that my wife was infected with an evolved form of flatworms in which the parasite stays in the meat even at extremely high temperatures and infects the body of the predator who eats it. They said they don't know how dangerous she could be right now. I was terrified and I knew not only my wife was in danger, but the kids as well. I demanded to go home to protect my children, but they refused to let me leave. Since we were still near the door of the lobby, I punched one of the men in the face and the other below the belt. I ran to my car and quickly drove home." 

He turned his eyes into his palms as if he was feeling years and years of guilt lay on him. 

"It was nearing midnight and I arrived at the broken down house. I grabbed the shotgun from my trunk and I walked up the steps of the house. Before I opened the door I noticed the smell of blood, so I opened the door cautiously. The slow creak of the door must have triggered the movement of a creature of some sort. I ran in making sure to keep my weapon level. I go to mine and my wife's bedroom and nothing is there at first. Then. Then..."

He clenches his fist and now the tears are rushing off his face. 

"Then I hear something crawling on multiple legs out from under the bed. I see my wife sliding out with a pale look on her face and blood dripping from her mouth. Her black eyes were bulging out of her head. As she rose from under the bed, she had 8 legs representing that of a spider and stood at twice her original height. I stared at her bloody face and that’s when I noticed the decapitated corpses in the corner of our room of her daughter and my younger son. I asked myself what happened and she unhinged her jaw and lunged at me. On instinct I shot her in her throat and she fell dead almost instantaneously. As her body lay there, I remembered my eldest son. I searched through the house for him and saw him lying on the floor at his last moments. I walked up to him and he told me my lover had turned monstrous and bit him and once he escaped her path, she ate the young ones. He told me he came back and hid in his room, but the blood loss was too much and he knew he was going to go. My last words to him were, 'I love you,' and his last words were, 'I love-.'" 

He cried for a minute or two before regaining his composure. I sat there absolutely dreading the ending of his story. 

"My last son laid there, unable to finish his sentence and I remembered I had one last round in my gun. I pointed it to my head and before I pulled the trigger, I heard a growl and saw a twitch from my son’s lifeless body. My son was transforming. I heard his bones break just to form his new body. I could see his legs transform into a hairy thorax with extra legs spurting out. He stood at 9 feet and as he continued to transform, I quickly turned my gun and shot his head off. Blood splattered across his room as his mutant body fell. My whole family was dead because of me. Because of my job I destroyed my family. Just before I finished my thought I heard cars pull up while the lights brightened the blood filled room. I went outside and told them what my dead son had told me and what I've done." 

Looking down at his thumbs, he chugged the rest of his beer. He looked at me with his bloodshot eyes and continued on. 

"They then proceeded to burn the house down and move me back to work for testing to make sure I wasn't infected. They drove me back to my house which was no longer there. Just my car. They gave me $7,932,384 in a lump sum to forget about the company, my family, and the unnamed parasite. And that's why I’m here. I am trying to forget. Trying to forget the horrible things I did to my family. Trying to forget the horrible things I saw. Trying to forget the truth. I've spent $6,264.33 trying to forget the truth. I won’t stop drinking until I can forget and you saved me $8 by wanting me to tell you this story. Well you can go now, I just finished my beer." 

I sat there in complete silence. Unfortunately for him, I read about this. His family was sacrifice for us to try to create parasites that would infect the enemies food, making them into giant insects that would die to any government grade insectice that we can throw at them. 

We were to soon release these parasites into the food supply of our adversaries, then watch them get infected. They would even attack and infect others until we could swoop in and wipe them all out easier than any nuke possibly could. Operation Change and Let It Rain as it was nicknamed. 

And unfortunately for me, my day off turned into an unexpected hit list of people to terminate. A simple phone call to my superiors to get not only this babbling drunk, but anyone else without official clearance who's heard the rumors. 

All I wanted was a night off with a few beers to drink.

Have you ever heard a rumor about yourself that finally made its way back to you after years of circulation, and you realize that everyone bought into it, and accepted it 100% as a fact, even though you know it’s a complete lie? That’s what happened to me. But way worse. People aren’t just saying that I sucked a dick or whatever. They’re saying that I’m *somebody else.* And you know what? I’m not even sure they’re wrong anymore. Maybe I am somebody else.

One morning a few weeks back, I was in the kitchen eating my Cheerios, screwing around on my phone, and there was this loud knock on the front door.

“THIS IS THE POLICE!”

I just about shit my pants, you know? I had a joint all rolled up in my backpack, on the stool right next to me. But I thought\*, there’s no way they’re coming to get me for a joint. That would be nuts.\*

“OPEN THE DOOR!”

Mom was up in the shower, and dad had already left for work. They kept on banging away at the door. I was scared as hell, but I didn’t see that I had much choice. I got up and peeked through the side window there by the door and sure enough, it was the cops. Four of them. Four cops, banging away at the door. I took a deep breath and opened it.

“Calvin Dunlop?” said one of the cops, a big massive dude that looked like he could crush me with one hand. The hand that was resting on his gun holster. “Step outside, you’re okay now. Is Lois Brown inside?”

“Uh… mom’s up taking a shower. And I’m not Kevin Dumlap. I’m Nick. Brown. Lois is my mom.”

This threw the big guy for a loop. He turned and looked at his buddies. Then a lady cop spoke up. She looked nice. Not nice enough for me to trust her, but nice.

“I don’t know what they did to you, Calvin, but you’re safe now,” she said. “Come with me, your parents are waiting at the station.”

I started to get a little dizzy then. “Dad’s at work, mom’s in the shower. What is this? Why are you guys here?”

I heard one of the guys in the back mutter. “Jesus,” he said. “He thinks they’re his parents.”

Big guy cleared his throat. “Step outside, son. We need to get in there and apprehend Lois Brown.”

It was a struggle to think at all, but I thought back to all those cop shows and movies and whatnot. “You guys got a warrant?”

One of the guys from the back thrust his hand forward, and there was a piece of paper there. I didn’t know what the hell it said, but I figured it was a warrant. I stepped outside. “She’s upstairs,” I said. “She’s probably… you know, naked, so be careful.”

Lady cop took me gently by the arm and walked me down the steps and to one of the cop cars. I turned my head and saw the rest of them go in the house. “Am I in trouble?” I asked.

“You’re safe now, Calvin,” she said.

I wondered who the hell Calvin was and why the hell they kept calling me that. Why the hell they were arresting mom.

“Get in,” said the cop, holding the back door open. Then, just like in the movies: “Watch your head.” What was I supposed to do? I got in and we drove off. “You’re not hurt or anything, right?” she asked.

“Nah,” I said. “Just… you know, confused.”

“When we get to the station, you can see your parents briefly. But then we have a lot of questions for you. I’m sorry. I’m sure it’s very painful and scary for you, but we have to get your version of events.”

She was right that it was scary.

\*

We got to the station and there standing by the front door were two people, a man and a woman. They were crying. I’d never seen them before in my life. The lady cop opened up my door and said, “It’s alright. You can go to them.”

I stood up, but I didn’t go to them. They came running over to me, and both of them wrapped me in this wicked bear hug. “Calvin,” they kept saying over and over again, sobbing. I guessed they thought I was this Calvin character too. But I wasn’t. I was Nick.

It was hard to breathe in that hug, but I finally choked out some words. “Who are you guys?”

They pulled away and looked at me in a sort of shock. “It’s mom,” said the man, “and dad.” He gave the cop a questioning look.

“He, er, seems to be confused at the moment,” she said. “That’s why it’s imperative that we get him inside and keep the investigation rolling. We’ll have him back as soon as we can, Mr. and Mrs. Dunlop.” She took my arm again and we started walking down the pathway to the front door.

“Wait!” cried this Mr. Dunlop. “Just… one second.” He dug in his back pocket and pulled out a wallet. He opened it up and held it out to me, stepping forward. “Look, Calvin, that’s us.” Behind a little shield of plastic, there was a picture of this guy with a little kid sitting on his lap. The kid was maybe, I don’t know, five years old. Sure, he maybe looked a little like I did at that age, but the picture was small, and it didn’t blow me away or anything. And the intense look in this stranger’s face was starting to creep me out.

“Oh, yeah,” I said. “Cool. Well, I better be getting inside now, right officer?”

\*

We were in that room for hours. It was Hell. I cried, I puked, I pulled a clump of my hair out.

They asked if my parents – Mr. and Mrs. Brown, they called them – ever hurt me.

“No, of course not.”

They asked if I remembered anything about the day of the kidnapping.

“What the hell are you guys talking about? What kidnapping?”

They asked if I ever tried to contact anybody for help.

“Help from what?”

On and on.

They were convinced that I was this kid, Calvin Dunlop. But I wasn’t.

“Look,” I said, at the end of my rope. “You guys screwed up, big time. Can I just go home now? Or school? Or anywhere but here?”

“Do you want to see your parents for a minute?” asked the detective, some dude with a ridiculous mustache.

“Yes!” I said, feeling relief for the first time that day. “Wait, no. I want to see mom and dad, my *real* mom and dad, not those two freaks that hugged me before.”

Mustache sighed. “Those *are* your real parents, Calvin. Look, hold on.” He turned to the mirror. I knew, again from the cop shows, that it was a trick mirror. “Jerry, bring my laptop in here, yeah?”

A few minutes later, this Jerry guy came in with the laptop and set it in front of Mustache. Mustache screwed around for a bit, then flipped the computer around so I could see it. “Take a look,” he said. “Scroll through those pictures.”

There were hundreds of them. Me as a baby, me as a toddler, me as a little kid, and so on. I recognized some of the pictures. My parents had shown them to me at various times. Some of them were even printed out and hanging on our walls. But others… well, there were a lot of them with where I was with those people who had hugged me. The people claiming to be Calvin’s parents. The people claiming that *I* was Calvin.

That’s when I puked.

I’ll tell you what they told me.

Ten years ago, when I was five years old, Lois and Andrew Brown kidnapped me. Nobody knows why or how. They moved us all from Florida to a little town in Maine. They had birth certificates and all that shit… a social security card.

So they moved us to Maine, enrolled me in school, got jobs, all that. And meanwhile, my “real” parents were going out of their minds, calling the FBI, stapling posters to telephone poles… apparently I was even on a milk carton at one point. They’d just woken up one morning, and I was gone.

The thing is, I don’t remember it that way. I hardly remember anything from when I was that age, but I definitely don’t remember Mr. and Mrs. Dunlop. I remember my parents, Lois and Andrew Brown. Vague globs of memory, sure, but I do remember them. I do remember that we lived in Florida and then moved to Maine.

The cops can’t explain any of that. They say I must have been brainwashed. They didn’t use that word, but it’s what they meant. But I don’t think you can just go in and change somebody’s *memories*.

And it’s more than memories. It’s a *feeling*. I’m living with them now, Mr. and Mrs. Dunlop, back in Florida. I begged them – somebody, anybody – to let me stay in Maine, where my friends are. Hell, I’m almost done with high school, and now I have to haul off and start over again? I haven’t seen… the Browns…  the people that I still feel are my real parents, since that morning this all started.

Like I say, it’s a feeling more than anything. Something is off with the Dunlops. Most of the time, they don’t do shit. They just sit there, staring at me, not saying anything. They make me sit at the dinner table and eat dinner with them, but they don’t say anything. They just chew in silence. Then one of them will randomly come out with something over the top: “How was your day today son!” Just like, way overenthusiastic, you know? And I’ll say something like, “Well, it was terrible, I’m really scared, and I don’t know what’s going on.” And they’ll say: “Isn’t that something!” and go back to eating in silence.

I don’t know. Maybe they got screwed up by the whole thing, but it just doesn’t feel right. Lois and Andrew… they could be assholes, but they *felt* like my parents. Now they’re locked up somewhere. I don’t even know where.

Another thing that’s really messing with my head is that there’s no media coverage of this. Not in Maine, not in Florida, not anywhere. I mean, I’m not trying to come off as important here, but you’d think you’d hear something about this, right? It’s a crazy fucking story, right? I asked the Dunlops about this, and they said they went through a media circus when I went missing, and didn’t want to go through one again. So maybe it’s not weird after all, maybe I’ve seen too many movies where the story always gets out to the press… but it sure seems like I should have seen something. Like, what about my friends back in Maine? Wouldn’t they be talking about this?

Speaking of my friends, I haven’t been able to talk to them since this horror show kicked into gear. They all unfriended me, and they’re not answering texts. Cory’s the only one I ever heard back from, after sending him like a thousand texts. He wrote back: “I’m not supposed to talk to you CALVIN and after what you did, I don’t want to talk to you CALVIN.”

*What?* After what *I* did? I sent another million texts to Cory after that. “What did you hear?” “I don’t think you heard the real story,” “Come on man, tell me who told you what,” etc.

So that’s where I’m at. I’m freaked right the hell out. I don’t know what’s real. I don’t know what I *want* to be real, as if I had a choice. I don’t know what I can do. I’m not even sure who I am. If anybody has any ideas that would help me sort this out, please, I am begging you, tell me what to do.

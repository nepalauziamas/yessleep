The “behind every door” game is a very simple game. It’s best played alone but having one or two people join you won’t really make a difference. But play at your own risk, as opening the door at the wrong time can bring terrible things upon you and the other players.

WHAT YOU NEED
a BUILDING WITH LOTS OF ROOMS (can be a closed school, an abandoned apartment building, hotel, or mansion) 
a FLASHLIGHT with brand new batteries, since you don’t know how long this game will last
a BOBBY PIN or any sturdy slim item that can be used to lock-pick
a good amount of WATER and NON PERISHABLE FOOD 
COMFORTABLE CLEAN CLOTHES with a change depending on how long the game may last
NICOTINE PRODUCTS, MEDICATION, TOOTHBRUSH, and anything you would take with you for a days long trip, since once again, you don’t know how long this game will last
SEVERAL STICKS OF CHALK, white or any light color is preferred 
a MAP of the building you are visiting
a VERY STRONG WILL and GOOD PATIENCE

RULES
don’t wear perfume or anything scented, they like sweet smells and it will find you a lot easier if it can smell you
don’t open doors if they are not locked. The doors will be locked any time you leave the room and if they are unlocked it means someone is inside, jiggling the doorknob will not alert them but going inside will 
do not allow anyone in the building once you are playing, especially if they don’t know the rules
you can’t exit the game until you’ve been through every single room, mark the rooms you’ve been in with your chalk
DON’T LEAVE THE BUILDING UNTIL THE GAME IS DONE

Now that we’ve gotten through all the rules, it’s time to learn how to play the game.

HOW TO PLAY
Enter the building you’ve chosen, make sure you’re already well versed in the building's layout, especially making sure you know about any basement or attic floors. The game can only start between 11:07 pm and 5:07 am, the darker the better. It’s also good to get to your location early so you can set up camp and make sure all your gear is working. 

To enter the game, you have to go to the highest door in the building (usually the door to the roof) , then lock it. Do the same with the lowest door, if there are more than one door, lock them all. Leave the key at the bottom floor.
By that point it should be 11:07 or later, if so, you have entered the game. To be sure, try one of the doorknobs; if it’s unlocked don’t open it, move on and try another door. That one should be locked. 

Move through the building, pick every door that is locked and spend no more than 3 minutes, even when you hear noises in the hall. Staying in a room for more than 3 minutes will make you so much more susceptible to it. It will do things to make you stay in the rooms longer. Banging sounds in the hallways, screaming and scratching on the doors, and even visuals inside the rooms like a crying baby or a dead loved one. The people you see in the room will almost always be crying, it wants you to stay and console them. The longer the better right? Don’t be fooled though, get out of the rooms. No matter what you see or hear, the hallways are always safe so never forget that. 

The hallways are you safe areas, but staying in the hallways will take time away from opening doors, leaving you in the game for longer. 
By now you must be wondering what would happen if you opened the wrong door, and what is “it”. Only one person I know has seen it and survived.

They’re long legged creatures with mangled arms, maybe 20 feet long. Their arms are tied in knots over their heads and around their torso. They have human faces that hang, numb and emotionless. There may be other variations, as the person only saw two in that door they accidentally opened. 

Everyone else who has walked into an unopened door has never left the game, the person who got out died a short few days later of unknown causes. See these monsters feed on the exhaustion and fear of the players, they make you run around, room by room for hours, maybe even days. They silently go to the rooms you’ve missed, waiting for you to make a wrong call. There have been cases where they would stay in the very last room for hours and hours till the players finally break and open the door. 
This is why you need to be strong willed and patient, otherwise you’ll be drawn into their trap.

I know this isn’t much, but it’s enough for you to play. You know some of the risks and most of the rules. Best of luck fellow thrill seekers, I know you’ll need it

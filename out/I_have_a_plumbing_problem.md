I have a problem with my plumbing. I came to reddit to finally get some answers. I (19F) have just moved out of my parents' house and started to live on my own. I decided to get a tiny apartment in a nearby town to my new college. I would’ve gotten a dorm, but rent was cheaper here. My parents are still a bit concerned on the rent amount, but I feel like I gotten a pretty good deal. The plumbing problem didn’t start until a few days after I settled in. I noticed the drain in the bathtub refuse to drain properly and scoped out an eerie amount of hair from the tiny drain. Heck I could’ve made a wig out of it. This didn’t freak me out since the landlord had said the resident before was a chemo patient and was losing amounts of hair by the second. He wouldn’t stop describing her beautiful black hair. So I automatically assumed it was her hair. As the day comes to night, I noticed while cleaning the kitchen, my sink begins to flood uncontrollably. I don’t remembering using it. The liquid in the sink stuck like an dead animal rotting away. It didn’t help that the gunk that came out looked like flesh. I didn’t question it since people enjoy making fruit smoothies and dump them in the sink if they can’t finish them. 

After more plumbing and flooding issues occurred, I called a plumber. The plumber looked at all the piping around my apartment and found nothing out of the ordinary. It was strange since the sink flooded so bad that my downstairs neighbors complained. I led the nice plumber out and continued my day like normal. Except for when I hopped into the bath. I got out of the bathtub and noticed the water wasn’t draining properly once more. It confused me since the plumber ran the tap in front of me and the water drained like normal. I shook my head from the lingering thoughts of confusion and plunged my hand into the drain. I pulled out hair. Not my hair. I threw it on the floor in disbelief that the same hair I pulled before was back in my drain. I cowered in fear as I realized there were maggots residing in the strands. All I remember is screaming out of fear and running inside my room. 

After that incident I packed up my bags and stayed with my parents for a bit. They warned me before and I refused to listen to them. They basically looked down on me and refused to listen to anything I said, all they could say was “I told you so”. I was already mortified by the maggot infested hair that I fished from my drain, so my parents belittling me made me go back. I headed back to my apartment to see police and fire rescue around the complex. I asked the neighbors and they stared at me with cold, heartless eyes, as if I murdered someone in front of them. A cop nearby who was blocking the entrance was my next target. I walked up to him and asked what on earth was happening since I was out of town for a couple of days. “You would think you would know your neighbors…. Until it’s too late”. I was confused and asked, “What do you mean by th-”. I got cut off by the horrifying scene of a black body bag being carried out. Someone was murdered when I was gone. I threw up in my own mouth from the stench that was coming from that bag. What made me lose my insanity wasn’t the smell, but was the evidence bags full of that maggot infested black hair.

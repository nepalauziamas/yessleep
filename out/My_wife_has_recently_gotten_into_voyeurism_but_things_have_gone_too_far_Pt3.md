Dirt. Blood. They were the first things I could taste, my mouth was full of it. I spat, my eyes still screwed closed from the sheer pain coursing through my entire body. I was lying on the floor somewhere, I knew that much. There was an A/C blasting somewhere nearby, and I was being doused in cool air. I slowly opened my eyes, seeing that I was in a dark room that I did not recognize. There was a couch, a couple of armchairs, and a long table that had been draped with a black tablecloth. There was a row of tall-paned windows on the wall ahead of me, but the drapes were drawn tightly over them. 

 I had to rack my inflamed brain to figure out why I was here, or what exactly had led to this situation...and then I remembered the birthday party, the black-eyed people, the nausea...Amelia...

 The single door in the room began to slowly creak open. I glanced over at it, sending more pain shooting up my neck and straight to my head. I watched as a man wearing all-white scrubs, not dissimilar from a doctor, came strolling in. He was completely bald and slightly overweight, with thick black spectacles on his face. He paid me no mind as I lay there on the floor, instead making his way over to the window. He threw back the drapes, sending in a mind-shattering torrent of bright sunlight. I groaned audibly and turned away, shielding my sensitive eyes. 

 "Hey....you mind closing those back up?"

 He gave no inkling that he had heard me. The man in white went towards the table and began fiddling with something. I dared to peek from behind my eyes towards the window. I could see a bustling, clearly upper-class neighborhood; People were jogging, walking their dogs, sitting on their porches or in their yards. It hurt too much to keep on looking because of the sunlight so I instead turned back to the bald man, who was now coming towards me, a syringe in his hand. 

 "Whoa whoa whoa, what's that?" I demanded, raising a bandaged finger to point at the needle. 

 The bald man looked from the needle to me, an almost bored gesture that gave me the impression he didn't want to be in that room anymore than I did. "Don't worry, it's nothing bad. It's morphine, for your pain. You took quite a tumble, Humpty Dumpty." 

 Though I was still skeptical, I didn't fight as he found a vein in my arm and inserted the needle. Almost immediately I started to feel much better; Though I still had no idea where I was, I was soothed, almost at ease. Almost. 

 "Who are you? Where am I?" 

 "You're in a good place. We found you on the ground outside that godforsaken house. I've been nursing you back to health." 

 "My wife...those people...you've gotta help me, man. They'll be looking for me for sure, they want to...to..." 

 The man in white tilted his bald dome slightly. "Who will be looking for you?" 

 I licked my lips, the calming sensation of the morphine still washing over me. The sun was still bothersome, but I kept my hand up, blocking it from my face. 

 "Those people...I don't know who they are, but they wear black...they were having this weird ass party, and they drugged me and they wanted to...to..." 

 "To watch you have sex?" The bald man, who had been picking at his fingernails, looked into my face now. I gulped. 

 "You're one of them, aren't you? You didn't save me!" 

 "Well that's a matter of opinion. The way we look at it, we *are* saving you." 

 I pushed myself up to my elbows. "How? By drugging me and recording me and trying to make me fuck women who aren't my wife? What the hell is this?" 

 The bald man was on his phone now, typing furiously away. He didn't give me so much as a glance for almost two full minutes. When he finally finished and set his phone down, he looked at me with his eyebrows furrowed. "I'm really sorry, did you say something?" 

 I felt my temper flare up. "Tell me who the fuck you all are and what you want from me." 

 "I'll explain everything to you, but the profanity isn't needed sir. Please try to be more polite. You're our host and the star of our show, after all. Kids are going to be watching, so I need you to behave accordingly." 

 My mouth felt dry. "Watching what?" 

 "The grand finale of course. I know this is all very confusing to you, but I'll try to summarize it best as I can. It's the least I can do for you. Your wife is a member of our family. We are the Children of Nature. Everything we do is for the quiet ones, who slumber down below." 

 I felt a chill run up my spine. 

 "You see, thanks to your beautiful wife, we know a great deal about you. I've seen so much of what goes on in your home that I could point out your favorite place to sit and read, or the songs you like to play when you're making love. Patience volunteered herself six years ago when she saw how pure your soul was." 

 My fists were clenched so tight it was a wonder I wasn't bleeding. "Volunteered herself...*for what?*" 

 The bald man was looking at his phone again, seemingly disinterested in the conversation now. "To be the one to harbor the most, uh, *passionate* of the quiet ones in the sixth year, to prepare your soul for its ultimate destiny. Every six years someone is chosen to be a part of something greater than they could ever hope to be in this life. Every six years someone has to be uh...prepared. Your wife has been drinking the drug that was supplied to us by the quiet ones thousands of years ago. She's affected by it too, but only slightly. She passes off most of it to you during your constant bodily and spiritual joinings." 

 I shook my head. "And the cameras? The voyeurs? What is that all about, huh?" 

 "We are all vessels of the quiet ones. They become stronger and stronger the more that they see. They can taste your energy, which is only but a morsel of your entire soul, through viewing you as you are being prepped. Patience is great, but she isn't the only one. We're everywhere. We can draw on the energy of millions thanks to the aid of social media. If only people could truly understand what they are watching and devoting themselves to most of the time..." 

 He was typing away again. I wanted to yell, but couldn't find my voice. This couldn't be real...I had to be hallucinating again...none of this made any sense...

 "....So, uh, yeah. Last night was supposed to be the feeding. Amelia is our princess, chosen by the quiet ones themselves. She harbored several of them at once last night, a truly incredible feat. You were supposed to lay with her and pass on your soul, which she would guide to the quiet ones in the next realm." He looked up from his phone, directly at me. "But you went and messed that up. We're charging you for the window, by the way." 

 "Look, man...no one's here, right? You can just let me go. I won't tell anyone about whatever the fuck is happening with you or your, uh, family or whatever. Just let me go!" 

 The bald man sighed. "I am sorry. Your fate was determined six years ago. You have been lathered up and prepared for consumption. After you penetrate Amelia and join your soul with hers, the ritual will be done. You've made the quiet ones wait another day...they will not be gentle with you on the other side..." 

 "She can't fuck me if I don't get hard. What'll be your plan then, huh?" 

 The bald man scoffed. "Oh, you'll be erect. The drug will make sure of that. You'll get one last meal before the ceremony. Patience is making your favorite...steak and potatoes. May your many eternities with the quiet ones be all that we've ever dreamed." 

 He turned and got up to leave the room. 

 "And what's stopping me from jumping through this window, huh? I'm not afraid to die!" 

 "Good luck moving," he muttered, just before leaving the room and shutting the door behind him. It was only then that I noticed the mangled limbs that had once been my legs. 

 I was placed in a different room that night. There were no candles this time, but there was a massive fireplace, the same red cushion from before, and portraits adorning the walls of people that I suspected had once been members of this cult decades and decades before. The fire danced wildly, casting looming shadows all over the room. I watched them, imagining them as the quiet ones watching me. My throat hurt from all the screaming I had done; Screaming that did me no good. I would never get to hold my son again; Would I even get to see Patience one last time, or would she be a part of the massive group of people that would undoubtedly be watching me as I literally fucked my life away? 

 I had my answer almost instantly. The door to the room swung open and Patience walked in, holding a white China plate and a cup. She was wearing a black dress, her make-up smeared all over her face. I stared up at her, tears in my eyes. 

 "How...how could you do this to me? Was what we had ever real? Were all those years for nothing, was it all really just an act?" 

 Patience said nothing, only walked up to the cushion and set the plate down in front of me. "Eat up, dear. The quiet ones await." 

 And with that she strolled out of the room, closing the door behind her. I looked down at the plate, the knife and fork lying on opposite sides. I looked into the cup and saw that she had poured our favorite wine; It was drugged, no doubt, as was the food. I stared down long and hard at it, and then I picked up my silverware and started to eat. 

 The Children began to file into the room about thirty minutes later. There were at least 60 people, maybe even more, all wearing black and all eager to bear witness to the macabre spectacle that had been promised. Bill and Carla fell to their knees, their heads bowed, raising their hands up as they welcomed royalty into the room. Amelia had entered last, wearing nothing but a hooded purple cloak. I couldn't see her face as she approached me, but I lay white-faced and trembling, the large red blanket covering my naked form on the cushion. 

 Amelia came to a stop before me, lowered her hood, and then raised her face to the sky. She said something in what was surely a very ancient language, and the rest of the Children repeated it in earnest. Amelia then lowered her head and gazed at me, those green eyes striking and terrifying. "The time has come. Your days have ended in this realm. You have no need for eyes, as you will see only what the quiet ones want you to see. You have no need for ears, as you will hear only your own screams for many eons, and many more after that. You have no need for a tongue, because all that you will taste is the pleasure of the quiet ones, blessed shall they be. You've already ruined your legs, but you won't need those either, as you will drag your body on the ground as the slave of the quiet ones from now on. Now fuck me." 

 I continued to tremble, my bloody hands grasping the blanket tightly. "I...I have something t-to say as well." With one slow movement, I tossed the blanket aside. "Given my choice in the matter, I suppose I have n-n-no need for a dick, either." 

 Everyone in the room gasped, some of them looking away in horror. My dick was gone, but I was not bleeding anymore; I had made sure to heat up the blade of the knife in the fireplace to cauterize the wound. Patience, stepping forward from the rest of the group now, fell to her knees, a look of pure hopelessness on her face. 

 Amelia's eyes were wide, burning with a combination of fear and rage. "What have you done? The quiet ones....they..." 

 Amelia began to spasm, as did Patience. The rest of the Children began to run, causing a huge blockage at the lone door in the room. Some of them looked back in terror, watching as both Amelia and Patience slowly rose into the air, their bodies trembling and jerking. Amelia slammed hard against the ceiling, her eyes rolled back in her head, her mouth seemingly stretched wide open. Patience's legs were spread and she was arched, blood running out of her ears and down her legs. Her nose was suddenly smashed in, and then she was thrown violently against a wall, dropped to the floor, and then jerked back and forth in different directions. This went on for several minutes until, finally, their limp, ruined bodies fell to the floor. By this point all of the Children were gone; they had dropped any and everything in their mad flight from the house. 

 With great difficulty I managed to crawl towards a cellphone that someone had abandoned. I was going to call the police, but I had to check on something first. I slowly typed in a number, leaving blood smeared on the screen of the phone. I waited as it rang. 

 "Hello?" 

 "Hey, Lori. Everything going well? How is Jimmy?" 

 "Oh, hey Mr. Smith. Jimmy's been such a good boy, he's fast asleep upstairs. Do you want me to wake him?" 

 I was smiling, despite the intense pain I was in. "No, no, that's great. Let him sleep. I need you to do something for me, though. Call the police. Lock all the doors. His grandparents may come by, but whatever you do, don't let them in. Tell the police that you want to meet me at the hospital when they get there, okay?" 

 "Okay...everything okay, Mr. Smith?" 

 I looked at the corpses lying a few feet away from me. "Yeah...I think everything's gonna be okay."

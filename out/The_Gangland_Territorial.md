Call me Crass or whatever the hell. But as far as I know, no other hood can compare to mine; Whatever we do, we do that shit. Im not one for incriminating myself on the net, so ill keep that part brief. But we stick together; know that. Real shit though, last night set some oceans in motion; that I fear the outcome of. Whole block cant make heads or tails of the shit, dead homies. So I really just need some type of external frustration put into this situation.

&#x200B;

No one knows I'm talkin on the blogs and all that; so I do ask you keep what I tell you in this one.

&#x200B;

Yesterday, I get out of class around....3:45 in the PM, I stay in 6th period a little longer; Cause you know - Ms. Swetnam fine ass. Anyway, I  head to the handball courts afterwards - older homies come around with the brews to the courts; Its a normal ass day. I play till around 6, I live just down the street so its a 3 minute skate from school Back to the house. Coo.

As soon as I see the front of the crib, I know something's off. I can't explain it in words other than - a 6th sense. When you get raised in violence, bred to do violence, all without getting caught; You develop some type of enhanced intuition for real.

They say humans used to have that naturally, back when we was all like; hunter gatherers. Whatever it is, my shit was going off, tingling like crazy. By then I already had my strap out. A .38 I usually keep on me if I got nothin else. Whole time I probably looked like an oddball slowly inching towards my own crib, like its enemies inside. From the outside lookin in, I looked percced out; my shirt gettin wet spots on it from the sweat and all. I make it to the door, and crazy shit is; I knocked.

*No one answers*

*Nobody Home*

*Coo, I can just open the door now*

*Just turn the knob Loc, that's all you gotta do.*

It's almost like, I didn't exist in that moment. Nothing did. Freestyling through air like oxygen, just waving in the wind like a plastic bag comin from under a car. I couldn't feel much of anything.

&#x200B;

I kicked that bitch in. Right off the hinges. Something wasn't goin, and if it was enemies in my crib; either they was gon die or I was.

I didn't see nobody in the front room, so I slid around the corner to my bro's bedroom. Door was open, checked corners real quick - Slid to my sisters room. Same thing; door wide open already.

After doing this to every room includin the bathroom, I felt a little goofy id admit.

Now I gotta explain why the front door broke and my OG gon get on my ass. Mama pretty skilled with that belt; damn. But even after all that, plus knowin imma get my ass beat; my intuition was still going crazy though; something was still off; But I had no lock on what that could be.

***Oh Shit.***

My sister; *never* leaves her door open. She locks it every day before we go to school; because my lil bro always takes her shit outta there. Yeah; its someone in here. Gotta be.

&#x200B;

I double-back to her room, and check it again ; as soon as I do - Something festering breathes right on the back of my neck. It was a hot, musky type of air. An irregular moisture accompanied it; and I was frozen in place. I couldn't do nothin. It's almost as if I got licked by something. But something I didn't wanna turn back and look at.

I've been in rooms full of people that got no problem takin ya head off. Been in certain situations where my well-being was put at risk the deadly way. Never have I ever felt this type of energy from something.

Whole time this goin; I'm still facing my sister room. Then; the closet slides open slowly.

Midway- I can see somethin in there - blacked out like a shadow, but its somethin in there.

And its looking at me - I turn tail to get the fuck outta there, and i'm met with a bright white light and a crazy headache.  I woke up in the hospital after that. My momma say the Doc's think I tried to off myself. Probably because somewhere in that moment, I pulled the trigger, Shot my foot on the way down or something. my moms found me when she got home though, no one calls the police around there.

When I got back to the crib I made a straight dash to my sister's room, she was in there doing homework now and the closet was closed.

She looked at me with sad eyes, *"What's good? you straight C?"*

&#x200B;

*"Yeah, a lil sum happened when y'all was gone, I think it's coo now though."* I came back.

She wouldn't let up on it , *"I know what you be doin Crass, don't play dumb with me. I been told you to get out of that mess."*

&#x200B;

*"Look bro, I wasn't tryna off myself; it's some shit really weird going on right now. Somethin aint right Eve."*

*"Alright imma believe you C, just talk to me if something is bugging you; alright?"*

I could tell she was more worried than usual, so I didn't wanna tell her what happened.  Right then, because right now - It'll just sound crazy.

I managed to ease the tension in the mentions and everyone cooled down. We got old Uncle from down the way the come put the door back up; Ma cooked up some heat. For them, the night was nice after that.

I stayed up though. My intuition was still going crazy. I checked to make sure everyone was asleep, and made it to Eve's room. I had the key to the room, so I unlocked it slowly. Creaked open the door.

&#x200B;

I notice immediately the closet open, but not just that. There's some sort of - White - grey...fog? Mist? leaking out of the door. 

I looked where it was leading to, and it was creeping up Eve's bed. She's out, but can't hear me - Im gasping for air at this point. 

Then I look at her.

She's covered in it; the fog, I rush over to the bed to wake her; No matter how hard I shake - she wont get up. Then I hear something

*"Stop it child. If she wake's it'll startle her worse that you are now."* 

&#x200B;

 I stammered out, *" W-what the fuck-"*

&#x200B;

*"Am I ?"* it chuckled. 

*"I am what one would call a Territorial - it's- not of use to explain all, as you wouldn't understand. Yet."* 

It lifted up what I could only call; it's, head? There was eyes but like; red and distorted, in a white foggy silhouette.

*"Would you like to know, why I'm here?'*

I just nodded, because At this point, I just wanted it to leave out.

*"I was bred by you, and your kind. In essence; Do you know what a ghost is?"*

*"Yeah, so.." -*  I whispered, managing to steel up a couple words.

*"No, I am not that. I am the result of blood young one. Brutality."* 

*"I am what you create in violence. I am what you sustain in your brutality. I will admit though; this is the first time a human has noticed me."* 

*"My - my sister-"* I mentioned

" Oh her? No need to worry; she's a rare innocent in these sorts of zones. But she's the only thing that would lure your out."

I started backin out of the room, and it followed. It got up to and inch close to my face, and looked me directly in the eyes with it's.

I saw everything. Every event from the war going on. My friends getting knocked off, the Big Homies getting killed too. Like a reel of everyone close to me having their last moments. I finally felt the weight of everything I had been doing. What was the real price? How many of us would be left after it was all said and done? 

I pulled my .38 outta my pocket; I couldn't stand to continue to contribute to what was going on. And I knew it would ,but at least I wouldn't be there for it. So I raised it up to my temple. 

*"Before you do that, there is something else you need to see."* I looked into it's eyes again, and it showed me things, that looked just like it; in every one of the homies houses. Some blanco white, some as dark as shadows. All equally terrifying.

&#x200B;

*"You see, you have a chance. The Corruption hasn't quite set in for you yet. But some others, as you can see, will be leaving this world very soon."* 

&#x200B;

Tears streaming down my face, *"What do I do?"* I managed to get out.

&#x200B;

*"Well, that is up to you. From here on out; your actions will be weighed on The Scale. It's up to you to straighten out."*

It disappeared after that.  I collected myself today and just got outta Swetnam class. She asked me to stay after and asked about my foot. She said I could come in there whenever I wanted to chill out during the day. Ima most definitely be using that.

Ima see if I can see that thing again tonight though, because I got some questions for it now. We gonna see how it play out; but i'm not scared of that no more. I tried doing some research in the library about it; and I wasn't able to find nothing to explain it. 

That's why I'm telling this here, if this "Territorial" is a real threat we got no way to defend against it. Not to mention all the other ones just hangin around.

I feel like, if something doesn't get done about them fast; We wont make it out.

“What was that? Did you hear that??”

The walkie talkie I was holding let out a short beep as I let go of the button used to speak. 

“Yeah we heard it too”

Dylan’s voice came through the small speaker. He and Stephen were back in the van, or “Home Base” as Stephen liked to call it. We’re paranormal investigators, and our last assignment had us out in the middle of nowhere, investigating a creepy ass abandoned motel that was said to be haunted by some kind of horned, demonic presence. 

When we stopped to get gas earlier, the teenager behind the counter had a look of concern when we asked him for directions. 

“ Sounds good man, you might want to wear a hard hat though” 

“Why is that?” I asked him. Usually when going to these kinds of places, the boys and I brought holy water, not hard hats. 

“I heard the last paying guest who stayed at that place had his head caved in with a rock. I guess his face was unrecognizable or something” 

“Oh joy” Dylan had said, grabbing the energy drink off of the counter. Stephan just shook his head. 

Now, here I was. Standing in the middle of room 7, with an exposed cranium and an expensive camera strapped to my chest. 

Stephan’s voice crackled to life over the walkie. 

“Hold tight Danny, I’m coming.” It sounded like someone had thrown a bowling ball onto the floor in the bathroom. My camera was sending a live feed back to the van while those two were swapping out batteries. I inched closer to the door of the bathroom and shone my light around. 

“Tell me your name,” I said to the empty room.

Silence. 

“Is there a presence here with me?” Again, no answer. I clicked the off button on the spirit box strapped to my hip. 

“Guess you’re a little shy today” I muttered to the empty room. 

That’s when something grabbed me on the shoulder. 

I screamed and spun around. 

It was Stephan. 

He started laughing, doubling over and clutching his stomach. 

“I’m sorry man, I’m sorry. I figured you would’ve heard me walk in!” He stood up straight and put his hands up, palms facing me in a submissive gesture. 

“I couldn’t hear you over the spirit box, jackass.” We both laughed at this. Once that little machine was on, it really did make a lot of noise. 

“Well at any rate, why don’t you go put some fresh batteries in that bad-boy and we’ll meet up with Dylan over in room ten.” 

“Roger that” I said, giving him a little salute as I walked out of room seven. I headed down the short concrete steps and across the parking lot to the van. Dylan was sitting in the back, his legs hanging as he fiddled with his own camera.

“Steve scared the heck out of me in there, nearly crapped my pants.” 

Dylan chuckled as he handed me the usb cable. 

“I’m glad you didn’t, I don’t think there’s anywhere to buy underwear in a one hundred mile radius.”

I plugged one end of the cable into my camera, and the other into my laptop. I always liked to check my footage as soon as possible. 

I opened up what I needed to see and began to watch. Nothing unusual, just a few minutes of me walking around, talking to myself. I fast forwarded to the end, and then let it play through. I got to the point where I was standing in the bathroom, just before Stephan walked in. 

Wait a minute. What was that? 

“Dylan, come look at this” He put down what he was doing and stood next to me, looking at the screen. 

I pointed at what I was looking at. 

“Whoa” Dylan said. “Can you enhance that?” 

I did. 

We both looked even closer. 

“Oh God” I said. I dropped the laptop and we both ran full force back to room seven. 

“Stephan!” I shouted. “Stephan!” 

We slammed the door open. He wasn’t in the main area. We both ran across the room and into the bathroom. He wasn’t there. 

“I’m calling the cops” Dylan said, running back to the van to get his phone. 

I stood there, frozen in shock and horror. 

On the video of me standing in the bathroom, right before Stephan entered, there was a reflection in the mirror, to the side and about a foot behind mine. 

This reflection was of a man in a black cloak. A man with horns and red eyes. 

Stephan is still missing to this day.

 

I would like to begin this story by simply stating that I do not claim to hold any answers regarding the alleged events detailed in the written material in which it was found. I only hold myself in regards as a fellow listener and observer, as what is contained within our findings will leave a lasting impression on my psyche for as long as I live. First thing’s first, however; a small tidbit about myself. For as long as I can remember, I had always had a strong fascination with the European warrior cultures of old. 

Vikings, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, Celts and all the like, I would say that I had viewed them as idols, they were my heroes, while other kids my age melted over their favorite musicians, celebrities and online influencers, I on the other hand dreamt of shaking the hand of Alfred the Great, or perhaps experiencing a ride on a longship captained by the Kievan Rus. To me, they were my inspiration for I saw true strength within these past legacies. This infatuation would lead me to take on a drastically different personality than those of my fellow adolescents. The knack for history caused me to often find myself glued to the screen of my high school’s computer cafe with every chance I could get, combing through articles detailing the latest archaeological finds as well as academic material covering Europe’s antiquity. These habits would carry on with me into college, and by then, I had already long since chosen my career path. 

For starters, I attended a four-year degree at a rural university to obtain my bachelor’s in the field of linguistics with the aim of eventually receiving my doctorate in philology. Fast forward eight years and this distant dream of mine would come to pass, bringing us to the present day. I would like to stress that this story is not about me, but of course what I discovered. I never shed my fascination with Europe’s ‘titans’ of old, and this led me to independent study of the Old Norse language, as I had thought of it as a kind of Rosetta Stone with the prevalence of both runic and Latin script existence as the language’s written form. I am unmarried and have no children of my own. I live alone in a relatively posh looking house not far from the coastal outcroppings of Maine’s storm-wracked shores.

The absence of a spouse enables me to remain boldly entangled in my studies, although I would be lying if I were to say that an imposing sense of loneliness did not permeate my mind from time to time, and there are indeed some instances where I regret my socially detached lifestyle, with most of my outside contact comprising of likeminded conversations with my colleagues over the phone. Despite this, my contentment is renewed by the mental reminder that my work may one day be sufficient material to be deemed useful by future pioneers within my field. I would carry on the same routine of analyzing bits and pieces of obscure etchings into rock, all products of the most recent archaeological marvels in an attempt to decipher their meaning. This ranged from the ancient and enigmatic Cuneiform inscribed by early Semitic scholars onto clay tablets, to saturated and worn-out letters written in Middle English, and of course what small amount of material involving Viking age scripts we just so happen to have collectively gotten our hands on. I often consulted and shared my findings with my small ring of acquaintances, the majority of which happen to be anthropologists at the local university. 

This seemingly mundane existence of mine came to a standstill on an icy day in November. I had been in the kitchen preparing my supper when the phone rang. I held the receiver to my ear after washing my hands to be greeted by the voice of Johannes, a longtime friend of mine as well as a linguistics expert who taught classes in his profession at Moravian University. His normally low and soft-spoken Dutch accent was unusually filled with energy, not even stopping to hail me as he usually did. 

“Where to begin!?” his voice sputtered through the phone line. 

“I take it your newfound enthusiasm is indicative of something of notoriety to even **you**? In that case, I’m all ears.” I followed my reply up with a throaty chuckle, marveling at the sudden change in attitude in Johannes’ normally business-like demeanor.  

Johannes went on to explain that while attending a faculty conference at his institution, he had struck a conversation with a pair of visitors who had identified themselves as being Norwegian archaeologists going by the names of Espen Skolmsson, whom I’ve heard of during my research into Viking age archaeology. He was held in high regard by his peers for his 27 year long career in his profession and for his keen sense of charisma when locating Norse artifacts. He was matched by his companion of the same profession, Aurora Larsen, who had spent the majority of her life in the area around Hammerfest; only going abroad for her work. The conversation had apparently graduated from mere post-meeting chat to talk of a potential archaeological site in the Faroe Islands. Espen had supposedly explained that himself and Aurora were assigned to the site at the request of the Faroese Parliament in Torshavn, and that they were in the process of putting together a kind of team for the job, looking to hire on professionals specializing in the fields of archaeology, anthropology, linguistics and anything that may come as useful during the excavation process. 

At this point, I could already see where this was heading, and I felt a strong sense of child-like excitement welling up within me as Johannes’ next words confirmed my presumption. 

“I professed to them my background, and they were kind enough to offer me a place in their excavation. They said that they were in dire need of additional on-site professionals to assist them in their research upon discovery of any artifacts they may find, so, seeing the opportunity, I’d like to request that you accompany me and a few of my colleagues from Moravian to the excavation site.”

The words had already left my mouth before I had even processed what I was hearing as I agreed, sounding indeed quite like a child on Christmas morning. The prospect of finally stepping outside of my own little realm and making a name for myself was tantalizing. Of course, the potential discovery of age-old artifacts left behind by one of Europe’s mightiest warrior cultures was as sensational to me, but I felt that this trip would be a much-needed breath of fresh air in my life as well as a slick addition under my belt to enrich my career. My trip began three weeks later, in which that time was spent making the proper preparations, although according to Johannes, Espen had reserved us all complimentary airline transit. After packing all of my personal belongings as well as my analytical equipment which had mainly consisted of a mattock, high intensity LED and UV flashlights, and my books, which contained a wealth of written metadata necessary for linguistic research. 

I had felt it to be a rather underwhelming kit, but ultimately, I’m no archaeologist, and the less I have to lug around while abroad the better anyways. Once packed, I caught a bus to the international airport in Portland before boarding my flight. A day later, I arrived in the Faroe Islands. I had made my way to the excavation site via boat from Tórshavn. The site was located on an island named Skúvoy, located in the central region of the islands, just south of the much larger island of Sandoy. The island itself was named after the significant presence of great skua, a species of seabird. 

Even as the island came into view upon the horizon as the small tour vessel approached its shores, I felt my jaw loosen as I took in the sight. The island sat upon the water, ancient and unmoving as the waves broke against its shore bound rocks, like a great, titanic beast of the ancient world. When I eventually did reach the island, I had thought that even the docks themselves must have been of a pre-modern creed; with their darkened and barnacle ridden wooden patchwork which creaked resoundingly as I took my first steps after disembarking from the ferry, slinging my modular backpack cramped with my belongings over my back as my feet came to rest upon the time-weathered planks. I scanned the surrounding environment: a gruff mix of shallow grasslands and rocky outcroppings. The island had seemed so enigmatic to me.

This feeling was supplemented by the vanishingly small population of Skúvoy, consisting of just 40 people who inhabited the island’s one and only settlement of the same name. It was there that Johannes along with Espen and Aurora were staying at a local inn. I set off for the village on foot, which given the island’s small size, wasn’t too much of a trek. It was an overcast day, accompanied by the soft chill of the ocean breeze which shadowed the crunching and grinding of my boots against the sand and rock as I made my way up the trail towards the village. Despite the serene aura, I felt a soft grimness as I recalled the island’s history.

The entire population had been all but eradicated by the Bubonic Plague during the 14th century. All except for one young woman, whose cottage can still be seen to this day, standing alone and derelict upon the island’s grassy outcroppings. A similar event took place later in the 18th century, in which the island’s population was once again wiped clean by an epidemic of smallpox. Of course, there appeared to be yet another, less recent chapter of Skúvoy’s history waiting to be unearthed if this site is of a genuine Norse origin. I continued my trek along the beaten trail, the maritime wind and soft splashing of the waves against the rocks convened to create a low ambience, that being much different than the harsh, storm wracked conditions I had imagined before departing from the States. 

I walked along the trail for around twenty minutes or so before the village of Skúvoy entered my field of view. It was situated down near the shore before a large hill, like a single pearl entombed in a field of green. I could see as I drew closer that the bulk of the village consisted of the same wooden trading houses as seen along the fjords of Norway; a stark mix of both modern and traditional architecture. As I finally reached the settlement, I stopped to observe the environment. The village was everything I had expected it to be: quiet, and utterly unperturbed by the world outside. 

An old woman sat out on the porch of one of the nearby houses, crocheting what looked to be a pair of fur gloves. She looked up briefly and acknowledged me with a smile, trilling out a greeting in Faroese. I responded with an awkward smile of my own before raising my hand and continuing on my way along the grassy slopes. A church sat as the centerpiece to the town, its classical Gothic aesthetic reminded me of those in small, rural towns back in the United States. After I had finished my brief sight-seeing, I began my search for the inn we were to be staying at. 

Its name was utterly unpronounceable to me but after a short period of searching, I spotted its name in cursive letters painted onto a wooden sign dangling by two silver chains from the awning of a building that resembled a beer hall. It was much larger than I thought it’d be for such a small community, although it was likely intended for tourists. I approached the wooden double doors of the inn which were painted a dark green and adorned with what looked to be 

Yuletide decor in which it reminded me of something from out of a classical fantasy story. I pushed the doors open and was greeted with a strong scent of ginger. The lobby had a rustic quality to it whilst radiating with a strong sense of antiquity. 

It reminded me of the old stave churches in Northern Europe. I approached the front desk where a man clad in an overly exaggerated uniform that looked more like a reenactor’s getup was posted. I gave him my name and he responded by presenting me with a silver key which was attached to a blue lanyard. He then gestured to his left towards the inner lobby. I thanked him and as I made my way down a softly lit hallway decorated extensively with sailor memorabilia, I spotted a table located in what I assumed to be the dining lounge that was occupied by a group of people hunched over what looked to be a keg of beer. 

I immediately recognized one of the occupants to be Johannes, who then locked eyes with mine and waved me over. A seat sat empty between him and another man who I presumed to be one of his colleagues. I took off my backpack and placed it on the ground near a nearby barstool before taking a seat at the table, just as I did, I found myself the latest scene of attention as Johannes spoke up above the sounds of drink and merry.

“At last, I would like you all to meet a dear friend and partner-in-academia of mine, Mr. O’Driscoll.”

The combination of his deep accent and the interpretive gesturing of his hands towards me as if he were unveiling a new household appliance beckoned a slight grin from me. It was then that another man sitting on the opposite end of the table acknowledged me with a sharply accented voice. 

“A pleasure to be meeting you” He spoke mirthfully.

He then placed a hand across his chest in a self-gesturing fashion.

“Espen Skolmsson” he said. “I’m glad you could join us in this project”

Espen looked as every part of how I imagined a Viking raider would look, with long, dirty blonde hair draped across his shoulders which was accompanied by a chiseled jawline and a full beard, all complimented by a pair of bright, blue eyes. He almost looked comically out of place sitting in a largely modern hotel dining room. Seated next to him was a woman who possessed the same blue eyes and sharp jawline whom I assumed to be Aurora in which she seemed to be investing herself in the wine menu. 

“The pleasure is all mine,” I replied. “I’m just grateful to even have gotten the opportunity to embark on such a prospect” Espen sipped his lager before speaking again.

“Well, we’ve been in dire need of additional members. After many of our original party retired from the field, we quickly realized that the two of us alone makes for a daunting task of excavating any historical sites.” 

“It's true” Aurora spoke up, pushing the wine selection away from her. 

“Last few of our assignments you spent hard pressed over a canister of booze.”

Her voice was much deeper than I imagined it’d be, almost as gruff as Espen’s. 

Espen’s eyes danced aghast briefly as if mildly embarrassed. “Anyways, I read the dossier you emailed us. Your transcript is impressive. I’m glad Professor Visser recommended you for this excavation project.” Espen gestured to Johannes beside me, who’d just finished draining his glass of a green tinted alcoholic concoction. 

“Only the best for…oh, damn” Johannes’ voice was now ripe with the effects of intoxication as he shook his head before laying back in his chair. Espen cracked a slight look of amusement before continuing. “The site we’ll be working on is located a mere two miles away. Supposedly the story goes that a local farmer was digging around with the ambition of installing a new irrigation well when his shovel struck something peculiar. After doing a bit of his own careful unearthing, he claimed to have noticed Younger Futhark characters inscribed onto an object that seemed to have been composed of iron and wood. Samples were taken from the apparently well-preserved wooden beams for radiocarbon dating which revealed that whatever this object is dates to the 12th century AD.”

I had felt myself fixated on Espen’s briefing with a keen sense of delight as I created a mental image of myself wiping away the centuries of soil and dust from a relic not touched by human hands for almost a thousand years and liberating a piece of the past from its subterranean prison. Espen continued, his voice grabbing my full attention once more. “Local officials have already closed the area off for our dig site, and we’ll be heading out at around 9AM sharp tomorrow, if that suffices with you.” I nodded, only all too eager to begin working. Espen responded with a nod back, and from there we spent the evening socializing over alcohol and the many horderves that were brought in between drinks. During this time, I became acquainted with Johannes' colleagues; fellow professors from Moravian University who had been recommended to work on the excavation site.

By the end of the evening, my eyes were heavy, and a wave of drowsiness had taken hold of my psyche. Scanning around the table, I could tell that everyone else had felt likewise. Johannes and his entourage were the first to excuse themselves for the night as they departed to their rooms. I bid Espen and Aurora a good night as I did the same, scooping up my backpack and heading down the hallway on the other end of the dining room, searching for the door that corresponded to the number that was printed onto the small, silver key I had been given. When I found my room, I entered and was greeted by a simplistic yet vintage looking room which to me had resembled that of a cabin living room. 

After making myself at home, I settled into the king-sized bed. It was not long before sleep found me, and I drifted off, my mind still infatuated with tomorrow’s happenings. I don’t know when my fruitful slumber had given way to the sight of long, tall forms looming above me, but I suddenly shifted as I found myself within a forest clearing. I pulled myself to my feet, looking in every possible direction and was greeted by towering pine trees which were all tightly packed together as if they were a set of dagger-like teeth. I noticed a small gap between the trees on one side of the clearing, and seeing no other option, my feet carried me towards it. Upon entering, I could see that the forest surely stretched for miles, wild and untamed. I felt as if I were the first being to walk upon the ground beneath my feet, and more disconcertingly, I felt as if I were an intruder in the home of a greater power.

As if something had heard my very thoughts whilst I continued to tread along the brush-strewn ground, two massive and unnaturally heavy footsteps asserted themselves behind me, stopping me dead in my tracks. Even in my dreamlike state, I felt every muscle in my body tense and contract as my mind raced in debate on whether to turn around or to simply run, but if I were to go with the latter, where would I go? At this, I felt myself turn slowly to face what stood behind me and when I had, it seized every niche of my mind. Stood roughly 20 feet away from me was a form that could only be conceivably described as otherworldly. It was immense, having to be at least 90 feet tall. 

Its humanoid body resembled that of a crudely drawn stick figure: impossibly slim, its limbs matching its bodily circumference, both its arms and legs ending in five needle-like appendages that looked as if they could skewer a horse as if it were a fish from a river. What terrified me most about this thing was its face, only that it virtually had no face. No nose. No mouth. Only two, large, almond shaped eyes that held only an endless pitch blackness; endless wells of nothingness that looked as if they could swallow me up without leaving a single trace of my existence. The skeletal figure then shifted from its place, abruptly springing into an erratic movement like a spider bearing down on its prey that had become entangled in its web.

It was on me in seconds before I could even react, its long, branch-like fingers clawing for me as it lunged down and prepared to devour me whole, but before it could, I awoke in my bed in the hotel room. My heart was racing as if I’d just finished participating in an Olympic event and my hands were clenched tight around the covers. My mind reeled from the nightmare as I scanned the still unfamiliar room, the events of yesterday culminating in my memory as I recalled where I was. I looked over at the digital clock that sat on the nightstand beside the bed. It read “8:23AM”. 

I pulled myself out from bed, rubbing my eyes as I sat up. I had thought for a moment of my dream. I had not experienced a nightmare since I was teenager, but nonetheless, I disregarded my horrific vision, reasoning that it was to do with my little adventure which was an all too rare experience in my normally mundane life. I swapped out my outfit for a fresh change of clothes and freshened myself up before hauling my backpack over my shoulders once again and headed out the door. It was a clear, cloudless day with only the occasional gust of wind. I met the others just outside the inn where they all waited next to a parked jeep.

Espen greeted me, and I was taken aback by his extensive arsenal of tools that he carried on his person. Small, miniature looking spades, picks and a few utility knives hung from his belt that coiled around a heavy jacket. It was a stark contrast to his more laid-back attire of a checkered, collared shirt from last night. Aurora stood next to him in identical fashion, whilst Johannes and his colleagues spoke amongst themselves behind the pair. “All set?” Espen asked, pulling a strand of his hair out from in front of his face as a sharp gust of wind blew across the landscape. 

I nodded, and from there we all piled into the jeep, putting our belongings in a space at the back. The engine hummed to life, and we set off. The drive was short along the dirt road to the excavation site, similar to the one I had walked along upon first arriving and was dominated by small talk between each of us. Upon arriving at the site, we all hopped out and gathered our bags. It was then that we converged on our point of interest, situated on an utterly empty end of the island, with only the sounds of the waves crashing against the shore below as we trudged to the dig site.

I could see a slight bump in the otherwise flat terrain of this part of the island and that it bore a partially exposed and dug up blotch of unrooted grass and overturned layers of soil. There were also already numerous multicolored stake flags planted at different points surrounding the mass in the ground, and on closer inspection, I could see the corner of something geometrical in shape poking out of the bump. All in all, the site was much smaller than I had pictured in my head, with each of the small flags separated by a max of around 12 feet apart each. Although this did not take away from the excitement I felt as a million possibilities of what we might unearth filled my mind. A burial? Or perhaps a trove of lost treasures from the days of antiquity? 

I looked and saw Espen visually scanning up and down the site with a strategic clarity to his expression before he knelt down, setting his backpack down and carefully considering his selection of tools in which the rest of the team had begun doing the same. Espen and Aurora, being the most highly experienced archaeologists of our group, had acted as the prime directors of the whole operation, assigning the rest of us each to different corners of the site, the plan being that we’d work from what was believed to be the outermost segments of the object based off of the indentations pressing up against the grass and make our way to the center. I examined the sharp corner of the object that was already sticking out of the ground, and indeed, it appeared to be constructed using what looked to be now deeply blackened but extremely well-preserved beams of wood and hardly rusted strips of iron. Upon the iron strip that was visible, I could see the unmistakable etchings of Norse runes written in the Younger Futhark fashion. We set to work, each of us all starting on a side adjacent to one another.

The initial layer of soil was highly saturated and thus much of the work required mattocks and spades to remove the first layer of earth. By that point, Espen and Aurora had assumed the majority of the work, meticulously brushing away the layer of dry soil and dust with a remarkable patience as both of their experience in their profession showed brightly as they traced their brushes against the now bone-dry dirt. Over the course of several hours, more and more of the object was revealed and we could see that it was indeed a box of some kind, still buried under a thin layer of hardened soil, which was made short work of after we had taken a break before scraping away the final layer, all preparing ourselves in a pleasant anticipation. Afterwards, we all stepped back as the final remnants of soil had been cleared from the surface of what was now revealed to be what looked to be a coffin. Its wooden planks darkened but still in remarkably good shape. 

Strips of iron were nailed along the sides of it for what seemed to be purely decorative purposes, with the long inscriptions of runes etched upon the entire length of each strip with one on the right side of the coffin terminating in a Latin inscription at the end that read “Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine.” or “Eternal rest grant unto him.” After taking a moment to take in what we’d just unearthed, Aurora let out a joyful laugh, followed by Espen and soon we were all rejoicing in our discovery, embracing one another as we celebrated our triumph. Once we had collected ourselves, we settled back around the coffin. It was then that the same idea had seemed to have crossed each and every one of our minds. 

“Should we?....” Johannes was the first to speak. We debated on whether we should open it, the main issue being the fear that we may cause damage should we attempt to pry away the almost millennia year old wood to reveal the contents that lay inside. Secondly came the moral issue of disturbing a burial site which mainly came from one of Johannes’ colleagues who was a Christian man himself, and as far as we could tell, we had unearthed a classic 12th century Christian burial. It was ultimately decided that given the sheer age of the coffin, it was worth investigating further, with the condition that it would be reburied in the spot in which it was found after extensive research was done on it. We gathered around as Espen knelt down beside the coffin. He ran his fingers delicately along the side, searching for an opening.

He seemed to have eventually found one, and he reached down to his belt to remove a mattock, which he then held the flat side of it against the wooden surface. After a moment of careful jimmying, the mattock’s adze blade suddenly slipped into a crack in the wood. Espen smiled before looking back at us as we all watched silently in an agonizing anticipation. He then slowly began to heave the mattock’s handle downward, and there was an audible *crack* as the coffin’s lid parted from its seal. Dust wafted out from the opening which had caused Espen to stop for a moment to wipe his eyes. 

He continued, enlarging the opening with each passing second, before it was wide enough for him to get his fingers under the lid. He tossed the mattock aside before gently placing both his hands under the lid. From there, he slowly opened the coffin. The ancient wood groaned only slightly as what lay within was revealed. Espen slowly stepped back as we all laid our eyes upon yet another marvel. In the coffin lay the mummified corpse of what appeared to be a man, his largely skeletal figure still bearing some swaths of long since dehydrated and withered skin, with some pockets of light brown hair still clinging to his skull. There were even what appeared to be some remnants of his clothes, existing as tattered threads that still clung to his body.

What had fascinated us more than the body itself, however, was what else was present in the coffin with it. While the coffin had been largely indicative of a classical medieval Christian burial, inside of it was also that of classic Norse tradition. Surrounding the man looked to have been his possessions. Some jewelry, silver coins bearing Latin inscriptions, a few cracked and worn clay pots, a couple pieces of iron cutlery as well as a silver crucifix that still hung from the man’s neck and lastly, laying right beside him, in classic Norse style, was presumably his treasured weapon: a two-handed Dane axe. Although much of the wooden shaft had rotted away, the iconic blade itself also remained in impressive condition. 

Upon closer look, there seemed to be something else that was clutched in the man’s skeletal hands, pressed just up against his chest. We had not planned on disturbing the body any further, but upon closer inspection with the use of HID flashlights, we made out that the object ensnared in the corpse’s bony hands was a book. Its leather cover contained what looked to be hundreds of pages from what we could make out. We all knew the value of what may be contained within the pages, an absolute treasure trove of knowledge and insight. We once again collectively deemed the book an essential object of research and Aurora stepped in and took Espen’s place. 

She reached her gloved hands down towards the cadaver’s chest, looking for a way to dislodge the book from its timeless grasp. After a few teeth grinding minutes of watching her try different angles, fearing that any second the corpse would collapse into a pile of dust, the book eventually slid out from its grasp, with its hands falling closer against its chest without so much as a light *crunch*. Aurora held the book closer to her as we all looked upon it. Aside from the few odd stains, the leather cover looked remarkably well and showed little to no signs of decay. The cover bore no words or illustrations, just a blank, leather, geometric slab. 

Aurora then slowly began to open the book, the age-old leather peeling away to reveal the first page. Atop the stained page of parchment paper which was usual for the time period was written “1164 Anno Domini” in which it was followed by page after page of what I immediately recognized to be Old Norse written in Latin script. The words were not written in the elegant, Gothic style font that was commonplace with many medieval manuscripts, but rather they were clear, simple and concise. As Aurora flipped through the pages, there were no illustrations to be found anywhere, just page after page of Old Norse in which I could make out a few short, basic words when recalling my studies such as “is”, when”, “yes” and “no” but otherwise not entirely intelligible to me without the aid of my printed sources. After skimming through the pages, Aurora eventually closed the book and we all stood in silence for a brief moment with nothing but the ocean winds in our ears.

Once the weight of all our discoveries had passed, we rejoiced at our findings once again. We had discovered perhaps one of most well-preserved burial sites on record, likely rivaling that of the famous Oseberg Ship. After our moment of triumph had once again ceased, we discussed amongst ourselves what our next action would be. It was suggested that further excavation around the site be undertaken within the following week. Although if we come up short, there would be work done at a later date by a separate team from Torshavn, who would likely be fielding much more sophisticated, state of the art equipment especially after learning of our discovery.

As for the coffin, it was to be shipped to Denmark for further analysis before being reburied as per what Espen had guessed would be at the demand of the Danish National Church, with at least some of the smaller artifacts contained inside being placed in an exhibit at a museum. Finally, the book would be temporarily entrusted to me, Johannes and his two colleagues, who were also linguistic specialists. If I might add, Espen had been particularly firm with the word “temporarily” and I knew we wouldn’t have much time to spend with seeing what we could translate. I couldn't blame the man, this was his operation after all, and I’d imagined something of this nature belonged in a safer environment. The sun had already begun to dip below the horizon, and it was decided that we pack our things for the time being and return to the inn.

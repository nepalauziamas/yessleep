According to legened, Deamhan Máthair is the spirit of a mother who died during child birth. She made a deal with the devil to allow her to raise one motherless child once every 18 years, but on the child’s 18th Birthday, her true demonic form is revealed to them and she must sacrifice the child to him in order to keep being a mother to those motherless children.

I was one of thise motherless children.

I wasn’t aware of my “mother’s” true identity growing up but I was aware of the stories of the demon mother who kidnaps babies at birth, raises them as her own and kills them on their 18th birthday. How these stories got out there were unknown to me at the time and I didn’t care much to look into it. 

Anyway, one morning I ran downstairs to make breakfast as usual. “Mom” left a note saying she was gone to the shops and she’d be back soon. I ate my breakfast, got cleaned up and dressed and sat on the couch on my phone. I heard a car pull up outside. I gave a look out the window and it was mom’s. Only the woman who came out of the car wasn’t mom. Mom was a short. beatiful woman with red hair and green eyes. The woman who came out of her car was tall and slender with grey skin, jet black hair, a grin that reached from one ear to the other and she had purple eyes. She was wearing a long, black, torn dress and had two bags of shopping. 

The woman opened the door.

“Mmm, what smells nice in here?” She asked

She sounded like my mom

It was only then I remembered the stories of the demon mother and figured my “mother” could been her so I acted natural.

“I just made pankcakes. There’s two left if you want them”

“I’m okay, honey. I ate in town”

She walked into the kitchen and put down the shopping, then came into the sitting room and sat beside me.

“What are you watching? she asked trying to take a look at my phone

“Just YouTube, that’s all”

According to the stories I’ve heard, Deabhan Mathair kills her children the second they turn 18 as she doesn’t want them to see her true demonic form, but why am I seeing her true form only now? My birthday isn’t until tomorrow I thought. 

She stood up, kissed me on the forehead and went back to the kitchen to unpack the shopping. 

I quickly searched up on my phone “Demon Mother” legends and found a full page on her. The stories came from kids who’s date of births she got wrong and managed to see her true form before she sacrificed them on the date she thought was their birthday. 

“I must be one of them”

I read and read and read but couldn’t find anything about defeating her, excpet for one story reitten by an anonymous user on a forum that said she admitted to him that if she didn’t sacrifice him before midnight on the day she thought his birthday was. she’d be sent to Hell for eternity. So basically, I had to survive the next 48 hours as my recorded date of birth is the day after I saw her true form for the first time. 

I spent most of the day in my room, thinking of a plan to survive. 

I had one in mind

“Mom, Claire just asked me to stay over at her house for a few days. She wants to take me out shopping for my birthday tomorrow and she wants us to do a a few movie marathons too, so is it okay if I go?”

“Aww, honey. I had planned for us to do something together tomorrow. I had a big surprise in mind and I couldn’t wait to tell you what it is”

“Can’t it wait a few days?”

“It really can’t”

“Can’t you tell me now?”

“I can’t do that either”

“Why not?”

“Because it can only be revealed on your birthday”

“Why though?”

She started getting pissed

“Why can’t you just spend the day with your mother, huh? I’ve been planning this surprise for ages now and I just want you to experience it on the day itself”

“Fine, I’ll tell Claire we can go shopping the day after”

“Yay. I can’t wait to show you this surprise”

“I can’t wait to see what it is”

That plan didn’t work. What was I going to do? I kept asking myself

The clock was getting closer to 12. I was starting to get nervous. I knew once that big hand hit 12, I was a gonner. It was 11.46 and I was starting to panic. “What to do, what to do, what to do?. Ah, got it”. I packed my phone and purse into my handbag, snuck downstairs and ran out the front door. “If she
wants me dead, she’ll have to find me first”

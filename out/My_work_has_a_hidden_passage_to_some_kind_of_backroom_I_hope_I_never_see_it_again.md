It was 5:13 PM on a nondescript summer night and it felt like the air conditioning units in the office probably hit the peak of their effectiveness back in the mid-1990s. Low buzzing droned overhead from the fluorescent tube lights that hung from the low ceiling. It sounded like a hellish mixture of cicadas and tinnitus. Occasionally I could feel my left eyebrow twitch uncontrollably when I concentrated too closely on the hum.

My hangover hadn’t improved the situation by any means. Most people tend to outgrow the urge to drink until the last call in dingy bar rooms during their college days but this is character progression that I hadn’t gained even in my early thirties. I told myself every night when I leave work that I need to just go home and get some rest.

Without fail, I ended up in some dive. Usually Jimmy T’s. I drank long necks by the bucket full until 2:00 AM. The trouble was that my job started at 7:00 AM. Under the best of conditions the taxi would drop me off at my apartment by 2:30 AM and I could manage to eat an unsatisfying microwave meal and crawl into bed by 3:00 AM. 

That would leave me about three hours to sleep if I got up to take a shower before work. Three and a half if I skipped the shower. Disgusting as it is, I usually skipped it.

But who cared?

In a little over fifteen minutes, I had already known I would be on my way to the bar.

I was a 35 year old single man with a rat’s nest apartment and a temp job assignment filing old claims for some mid-level insurance company in the midwest. My college career resulted in two dropouts and a low level felony for a bar fight that got a little out of hand.

I think it was Hunter S. Thompson who said, “Buy the ticket, take the ride.” I bought that ticket alright. A lifetime of poor decisions had resulted in a mostly loathsome existence. Even that terrible gig at a bland insurance company was just a drop of water trying to put out a house fire.

Soon enough this assignment would end. I would find myself at the temp agency office again filling out multiple choice question surveys to find the next position. It was unlikely to be any more fulfilling but it would cover the bills for a short time.

That’s all I worried about in those days. Paying the bills. Getting a few groceries every week. A little extra spending money to drink away the sorrow of lost years down at Jimmy T’s. 

At that moment I was worried about that damnable humming. I knew it was the electricity crackling in the bulbs overhead but the noise seemed to be a surround sound symphony that evening. My bones almost seemed to vibrate with the noise as though I was standing too close to a speaker at a rock concert.

The air itself even seemed to be getting thicker. You know the feeling when the humidity is so tangible you think you could almost cut it with a bread knife? 

Sweat was running down my neck and forehead in small, constant streams. It probably gave off the faint odor of beer from the night before which made me nervous.

As much as I disliked that job I had, I needed the money. Smelling like alcohol wasn’t a good way to keep gainful employment. Why did I keep doing that to myself?

My stomach was starting to get upset and I knew I would need to go to the bathroom soon. Whether it had been a result of a virus or the drinking I would never know.

My old desk chair squeaked as I pushed back from the desk in my cubicle and stood up. The temp in the cubicle next to mine, Brandon, was snoring softly in his chair which is a relief. A sleeping coworker seems rather unlikely to have smelled my beer-tinged sweat.

Brandon was a nice enough guy. This is my third placement with him from the agency. He is in his mid-twenties and goes to community college during the evenings. A photo of him, his wife, and their newborn twins sat on his desk.

The twins kept him awake throughout the night pretty often. He told me they both had colic and couldn’t settle down for more than a half-hour at a time. I always felt bad for him. Whenever I caught him sleeping at the desk I never said anything. No telling how many times he had smelled booze on me and let it go. No need to rock the boat.

In the corner near the hallways to the conference room, I could see a custodian in coveralls wringing a mop into a yellow bucket. Gray streaks of water ran down the beige walls of the office onto the floor. The ceiling tiles above it were dotted with red and yellow rings that were beginning to sag.

Those strange, rusty red and yellow spots always reminded me of a draining wound.

It was probably just condensation run off from the archaic air conditioning units on the roof. Seeping water mixed with the stifling temperature inside was likely one of the culprits responsible for the stifling humidity there. It had also produced the unfortunate side effect of an always present smell of must and mildew.

The smell of forgotten wet laundry had lingered in the office for days. My hangovers weren’t very intense on a good morning which made the odor just a nuisance. That day, though, the aroma wasn’t mingling well with the post-binge drinking stomach roll I had felt since I had arrived.

I chuckled to myself as I watched the custodian soak the water out of the thin industrial carpeting below the leak. It wasn’t a laugh at his frustration or misfortune with the water that flowed from the ceiling. The way he hung his head down below his shoulders as he worked on the mess made it look like he had no head at all.

The Headless Custodian. Just like The Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow fame with lower stakes.

My stomach gurgled like a pot that was about to overflow so I made my way to the restroom. I hoped no one would be in there to hear whatever gastrointestinal pyrotechnics I produced. With my luck, I had thought, there wouldn’t be an available stall.

The walk down the access hallway to the restrooms was free of any run-ins or small talk with co-workers. Standing inside the white tile bathroom the temperature felt ten degrees cooler than the cubicle bullpen. Cold air filled my lungs and the rumbling in my stomach had begun to cease.

Pushing open the stall, I sat down on the closed toilet lid and propped my knees on my elbows. Resting my head between my hands I waited to see if the ache in my stomach would pass. With my eyes closed and sitting in the cooler temperature, it felt as though I may have recovered from it without the usual round of light vomiting.

The humming noise in my ears was beginning to intensify. It had been present since the first day I started there but it had never been that overbearing. In the cool, empty bathroom it grew to a pitch I had never heard before.

Shifting my hands over my ears I tucked my head onto my chest tightly in an attempt to block out the increasing noise. My eyes were closed but I could see the light rise brightly to meet the same unnatural level as the humming continued. Wet drops of liquid began to flow from my ears and down my jawline.

I knew that my ears were probably bleeding but I was too afraid to uncover my ears to check for fear that the ungodly hum would rupture my eardrums. The overwhelming sensation of the droning mixed with the unnaturally bright light had completely disoriented me. Blindly I drew away a hand from my right ear and began to feel for the door to the stall.

I had to get out of that bathroom before I went mad.

As I stood from the toilet to make my exit I continued to thrust my arm forward to find the latch. My hand finally found the smooth facing of the stall door and I slid my fingers down to where the latch should have been but didn’t find anything. My heart rate had started to rise and panic had taken over.

With all of my strength, I started slamming my left shoulder into the stall door. The humming and brightness of the light hadn’t subsided. My pulse raced as I scrambled around the bathroom stall like a caged animal. The stall door would bow out a bit each time I hit it but it never gave way.

Slam!

Slam!

Slam!

Slam!

As I rammed my shoulder into the door for the last time I mistakenly thought the door was giving way. I was moving forward now beyond where the door was but it felt as though my body was passing through gelatin. When I opened my eyes to see what was happening all I could see was a gray blur.

The blinding light and maddening hum were gone for a moment.

It seemed as though I drifted forward through the gray haze for hours. There was no frame of reference for where I was or what was surrounding me. My limbs felt frozen in place and my eyes could only leer straight ahead, struggling to find any point in the distance to concentrate on.

Suddenly my slow movement forward began to accelerate and I tumbled down onto an unforgiving surface. My hands slid over the top of rough fibers leaving hot, raw flesh on my palms. A moment later my head made contact with the ground and my vision transitioned from gray to white to total darkness.

I don’t know how long I lay on the floor unconscious but the first thing I could remember when I started to come to was the humming. It was back but nowhere near as intense as it had been before. My face was flat against the rough carpet of the floor and I could feel the moisture on my skin and in my clothing.

Before I opened my eyes I remember thinking to myself that the toilets in the bathroom must be leaking. The thought of laying in a pool of toilet water disgusted me at first but the coolness was almost comforting. My eyes were still closed and I relished for a moment the fact that my stomach was no longer waging war with the rest of my body.

It was at that moment it occurred to me that there was no carpet in the bathroom at work. The entire room was a sterile white with cheap ceramic tiles. The industrial lighting always reflected annoyingly off of each characterless surface.

My eyes jolted open and began to drink in the alien yet familiar room. The walls were all a lifeless yellow, free of windows or decorations. When I was a child I could remember going to my great grandmother’s house with my parents. She smoked cigarette after cigarette as we sat in the old crackerbox house and the decade's worth of nicotine had painted the walls the same sickly color as this room.

It looked like the insurance office I had worked at for the past few weeks. Somehow it also didn’t look like it at all. It was the same basic layout but it felt all wrong.

Thin, rough carpet a shade or two darker than the walls stretched across the room. As I pushed myself up onto my feet, I heard the squish of moisture below me. There wasn’t enough water in the carpet to stand on top but the sound and shifting fibers under my feet told me that the entire room was saturated.

The reek of mildew was like a long forgotten gym bag full of sweaty clothes. I had expected the overpowering smell to make my stomach turn again but the sensation never came. It felt as though I hadn’t eaten in ages. My stomach growled with hunger rather than the usual hangover gurgle.

I placed my hands on my stomach to comfort the rumbling and was surprised to feel unusually long fingernails scrape against the fabric of my cheap button-up shirt. Holding my hands in front of my face I could see that the nails were longer than I had ever allowed them to grow. The tips were the same dull yellow as the nicotine colored walls.

Lifting my hands to my face I used the butt of my palm to rub my eyes in hope of readjusting my vision. As my hands slid down my face I could feel an even coating of beard growth on my cheeks. Regardless of how much I had let myself go over the years, I had never allowed myself more than two days worth of stubble.

I was equally surprised to feel the shaggy hair brushing my forehead and the top of my ears. My hair had always been cut short out of laziness more than anything. If you buzz your hair down to about a quarter-inch with a beard trimmer it saves money on haircuts and saves you the time of having to fix it in the morning before work.

How long had I been there? Drifting through the gray haze had seemed like hours but my hair and nails had grown as though I hadn’t groomed myself in weeks.

“Hello?” I said quietly. “Is anyone in here?”

Silence.

“Hello?” I said slightly louder than the first time. “Please, if anyone is here please say something!”

No response. My pulse had started to surge. 

“Hello!” I screamed as loudly as I could. Before I could follow up on my initial shout my voice began to echo back to me. It was mixed with the familiar hum from the lights above my head. The bulbs dimmed and reignited with each echo.

“*Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello………..*”

The pitch and vibration of the echo rattled inside of my skull and I placed my hands over my ears again. Dry blood crunched under my palms as I pressed them against the sides of my head. I knew the echo would have driven me mad if I continued to listen.

After a few moments, I could see that the lights were no longer flickering in response to the echo and I uncovered my ears. My eyes drifted from side to side in the room taking in the details. It was the cubicle bullpen where I had worked those past few weeks but all of the furniture was gone.

Where there had once been dozens of removable walls, desks, chairs, and generic potted plants sat an unsettling space. The wet carpet still had the indentions of heavy furniture and worn paths where the office drones had walked. Even the wall that had the dark stain from the leaking water looked the same.

I could see small ribbons of water pouring from the ceiling tile above it. Red and yellow stains now spread to the three tiles from where the leak had started. The tile closest to the wall where it had originated was now almost black in the center. It sagged so deeply I couldn’t understand how the tile hadn’t given way under the pressure.

It looked like a swollen wound that was readying itself to rupture and spill all of its foul fluid onto the floor below.

In a daze, I stumbled forward and began to walk toward the hallway that led to the reception area at the front of the building. While the lights overhead burned brightly I could see that the hallway was void of any illumination. As I stepped closer the bulbs began to flicker and hum to life as the lights over my shoulder toward the back of the bullpen began to crackle and fade to black.

When I entered the narrow hallway the lights burned brightly and the low ceilings made the constant humming grow in intensity. The tinnitus-like ringing in my ears began to rise and my head began to throb. My eyelids twitched as I focused on the hallway ahead of me.

It should have only been about twenty feet to the reception area but the hallways in front of me seemed to stretch for miles. Overhead lights began to kick on one by one continuously into a never-ending tunnel. Glancing over my shoulder I could see that the cubicle room was now completely dark. My feet began to amble forward.

I walked at a medium pace down the hallway for what I had assumed was about ten or fifteen minutes but no end was in sight. Lights continued to turn on overhead, producing the same dull humming noise I had become so accustomed to. The thought had crossed my mind numerous times to call out for help but I was too scared that the terrible hum-filled echo would return and drive me to complete madness so I decided against it.

It was clear to me that no one else was there anyway. Until I heard the squishing footsteps behind me in the distance.

As I turned to look I was surprised to see that the entrance to the cubicle area was directly behind me. After walking for an undetermined period I had expected to see an endless hallway, but I had made no progress at all.

Stepping back into the room the lights began to flutter back to life revealing the same empty room as before. Only it wasn’t the same. There was still no furniture and the carpet was still soaked in water but the walls looked different. They had become covered in slick streaks.

When I had left the room earlier to enter that endless hallway there was only a single dark line of water running down the wall. Upon my return, the entire room was covered in dark streaks leading from the ceiling down to the carpet. Water had now pooled deeply enough that the reflection of the humming light bulbs could be seen on the floor.

The ceiling had become pockmarked with the red and yellow swelling tiles. They sagged disgustingly between the supports. Fat drops of stagnant water gathered at the tips of the swollen tiles and dripped silently onto the soddened floor.

Something splashed and squished to my right and made me jump.

I spun my body to face the sound and saw a figure curled into a ball in the corner of the room. Drops of the filthy water peppered their dry white shirt and I could see it beginning to cling to their emaciated frame. Light sobs and mutters from the huddled mass drifted into my ears and almost sounded like music after the unending humming.

“Hello?” I said hesitantly as I slowly walked toward the corner. “Are you okay? Do you know where we are?”

The figure lifted its head from behind a curled arm. Even with the addition of a new scruffy beard, stringy hair, and an uncharacteristically thin frame I still recognized them. It was Brandon, my cubicle neighbor. He was wearing the same nondescript outfit that he did nearly every day but it looked careworn and tattered in comparison with his usual professional exterior.

“Brandon?” I asked. “Is that you, buddy?”

He didn’t respond but maintained eye contact with me. His eyes were piercing and he seemed to shake as I walked toward him. With every footfall, his arms squeezed around his body more tightly. It looked as though he were trying to use his feet to push himself farther into the corner with no success.

“Brandon,” I said reassuringly. “It’s me. We’re going to be all right. How did you get here?”

His mouth opened and a dry croaking came out. The words were incoherent as he rasped. He cleared his throat and stretched his neck before trying again.

“It was time to go home,” he finally replied in a shaky voice. “It was time to go home and you were gone.”

“What?”

“It was time to go home and you weren’t in your cubicle,” he stammered. “I went to look for you and… now… I’m here.”

I asked Brandon how he had ended up here but he just kept repeating himself over and over. It was time to go home. I wasn’t in my cubicle. He went looking for me. Now he was here. 

No matter what I asked he never changed his answer. I offered him my hand to help him up and to my surprise he accepted it. Lifting him to his feet should have been easier considering how malnourished he looked but this made me realize that I was likely in the same state.

Seeing Brandon and the poor condition he was in made me realize that I hadn’t felt well either. My stomach grumbled with hunger. The roof of my mouth met my tongue like sandpaper on concrete. My joints ached with every step. I felt so much older.

It felt like I had been in that hellscape for years without food or water. Maybe I had been. Nothing in my body felt quite right. It was almost as though I had aged a decade or more in a few hours.

I beckoned Brandon to follow me and returned to the hallway that should have taken us to the reception area. The lights behind us began to dim just as they had before and the electric hum of the lights ahead stirred into life. We turned the corner in the hallway to see the same endless tunnel that had been there when I went that way before.

Our pace was as swift as our weak legs would allow. Brandon’s labored breathing behind me was a welcome noise as it somewhat covered the hum of the lights over our heads. I tried to make conversation with him but he continued with the same replies from earlier in a loop. Still, he kept pace with me.

After what felt like hours of walking in the endless tunnel I thought I could see an end. The overhead lights of the hall gave way to what appeared to be a larger, well-lit room beyond. I thought to myself that perhaps the last time I entered the hallway I had imagined walking. Maybe the shock of this unusual place had caused me to hallucinate.

Even Brandon seemed to have higher spirits than earlier. He tapped my shoulder and when I looked at him he pointed ahead with a smile. We quickened our pace even as we struggled against fatigue and hunger.

By the time we had almost reached the new room, we were almost running. Brandon’s breathing had become ragged and heavy but I could still hear him keeping pace just behind my shoulder. The end of the hallway was getting closer and closer and my eyes struggled to adjust to the lights inside the room. The humming noise was becoming louder.

We entered the room and my heart sank as my eyes took it in. It was the cubicle room again. The near-endless hallway had done nothing more than lead us back to where we started. But the room was different than when we had left it.

The walls were the same monotone yellow as I originally remembered them. All of the ceiling tiles were perfectly intact. None of the walls were marred by the dark streams of water leaking down from the ceiling. Even the carpet below our feet had been dry.

In the center of the room was the custodian from our office. His head still hung low past his shoulders and he was using an old mop to soak the last of the water from the thin commercial carpet. Dirty swirls of water poured from the mop wringer into a scuffed yellow bucket beside him.

“Hey!” I yelled to him. “Hey! Do you know how to get out of here?”

The man didn’t respond. He just continued soaking dirty water from the carpet and ringing it into his bucket.

“Hey, man,” I shouted at him again from across the room. “We can’t find out way out! Can you help us?”

As I finished my sentence my words began to echo again with the electric humming undertone.

*Help us…. Help us…. Help us…. Help us….*

My ears began to throb again until the echo dissipated. Still, the custodian didn’t acknowledge us.

In the corner of my eye, I could see Brandon begin to shuffle slowly in the custodian's direction. He had become unsteady on his feet and I feared we had exerted too much of our remaining energy during the run down the hallway. He began to wave his arms over his head.

“It’s time to go home,” Brandon said shakily. “He wasn’t in his cubicle and I went to look for him.”

Brandon continued forward repeating the same sentences time after time. The custodian never turned to look at him. His soggy mop made the endless trip from the carpet to the wringer. He never turned his head.

I was frozen in place and watched as Brandon continued forward. My pulse was rising again and I knew I should have stopped him from moving any farther but I was frozen in place. The dry husk of my vocal cords wouldn’t even allow me to call out to him.

As he reached the custodian he extended one of his waving arms and tapped the man on the shoulder. The custodian ignored him and continued to soak up the putrid water from the carpet. Brandon began tapping him more rapidly with the same result. After a few moments of trying to get his attention, I saw Brandon grab a fist full of the man’s overalls and turn him around.

Brandon stumbled back and fell to the floor as the thing turned to face him. 

The figure of a man stood before us but there was no head at all. Its coveralls were unzipped to the pelvic bone revealing a chest covered in hundreds of reptilian eyes. They blinked rapidly in a rotation, producing the look of a hypnotizing swirl. As soon as the last eye blinked the first one began again.

Below the cluster of eyes, a circular mouth of wide, sharp teeth chittered. Three rope-like tongues dangled and flopped wildly from the opening covering the crotch of the coveralls in thick saliva. They began to extend toward Brandon who had become frozen in fear on the floor in front of the thing.

The mop dropped from its hands, splashing into the bucket. They weren’t hands exactly. Its arms ended in two fleshy crab claws lined on the inside with jagged fingernails. Flakes of red and yellow splotches contrasted with the creature's pale skin.

In an instant, the three writhing tongues extended forward and wrapped around Brandon’s wrists and throat. Brandon began to slide forward on the carpet and the abomination's round mouth opened wider and its teeth began to rotate slowly in the gray gums. Its eyes began to blink more rapidly and I was transfixed by the shifting pattern.

Brandon didn’t even struggle as he grew closer to the wriggling maw.

His head went in first and there was a wet crunch. Brandon’s body began to spasm violently. His right leg swung wildly to the outside as the thing began to slide his shoulders into the pulsing mouth. A foot connected with the bucket of filthy water and sent it spinning to the side.

The sudden movement from the bucket broke my fixation on the horror before me. I turned and ran back into the endless hallway. Lights bloomed into life and the overwhelming hum began to increase. The wet crunching and snapping of bones were enough to make me thankful that the electric hum had overtaken it.

My legs ached and my lungs felt as though they may burst as I pounded down the hallways. I had expected to run down the hallway for hours but after only minutes there was an unexpected hard right turn ahead of me. The momentum I had gained paired with the lack of control in my legs caused me to go crashing into the wall as I attempted to make the turn.

When my shoulder connected to the wall I had expected to bounce off of it but instead, my body began to slide through. After my head passed beyond the boundary of the yellow wall the gray haze overtook my vision once again. I continued to feel as though I were drifting sideways. Closing my eyes I relished the silence and absence of light.

\*\*\*\*\*

I came to on my back on the bathroom floor to a light tapping on my face. A faint voice filled my ears and my eyes began to open. Brandon stood over the top of me with a worried look on his face. His voice finally came into focus.

“It was time to go home and you were gone,” he said. My heart raced. “I went to look for you.”

“Don’t…. Don’t say that,” I stammered as I batted his hand away from my face. “Don’t say that.”

Brandon looked at me with a puzzled stare.

“Are you alright?” He asked as he extended his hand to help me up. I took it and pushed myself from the ground. “You look like you’ve been through hell.”

I nodded as I ran my hands over my face. The beard and shaggy hair were gone. My fingernails were back to their usual well-manicured length. My joints felt great. Looking down at my watch I could see that the time was 5:32 PM.

“I had the wildest dream today at my desk,” Brandon said. “I was in this room…”

“Not right now,” I said and held my hand up in his direction. “This hangover is killing me and I’m ready to get home.”

Brandon and I walked out of the bathroom, through the cubicle bullpen, and into the hall to the reception area. As we rounded the corner I caught a glimpse of the janitor in his coveralls facing away from us.

He paid us no mind and we returned the favor. His head hung past his shoulders and it made a cold chill run up my spine. The sound of water ringing out of his mop into the yellow bucket resonated in my ears.

I increased my pace and Brandon followed behind.

I’ll never step foot in that office again.

I think I’m done drinking too.

Monday I’m going to have to get my act together. Find a better job. Form better habits. This isn’t for me.

I don’t know where I went for those eternally long minutes but [I never want to see it again.](https://www.reddit.com/r/gtripp14/comments/uyezti/making_it_easier_to_keep_track_of_my_new_releases/)

I've been married to my beautiful wife for 5 years now, and it's been an absolute delight! She is the sweetest, and most prettiest lady you could ever speak to, but lately, something's been off about her. She's been... Quieter? She hasn't been speaking to me for a few days, and it was quite sudden. She's been... Quite aggressive too.

 Every time I spoke to her, she would turn around, and give me this glare. This glare, it was as if the devil has possessed her, like she'd burn me, like she WANTS to burn me. I was worried. Every night, while I was sleeping, she'd start.. whispering. She would whisper profanities, curses, threats. I'd eventually move to the couch where it was more peaceful. A week ago, I decided to clean my basement. Worst decision ever. 

Most people would love a clean basement, to make it look as if you'd want to live there. Me? After this week? I'd WANT IT to look unwelcoming, as a warning. While my wife was... I don't even know what she was doing?  She was... Staring at a painting in out bedroom... Blankly... For 5 hours. 


I decided to do something productive, as it was my day off work. I decided to do the worst thing ever, clean my basement. When I enter the basement, it smelled of a rotting corpse, add a bit of vinegar, and a bit of moldy sour cream. A smell I thought I'd never smell before. I almost threw up right on the steps.

 I closed the door to get some febreze. I emptied the whole can. Once I finally got the courage to enter the basement again, it smelt... Better. Slightly. Just enough to bare.I got to work. After about 2 hours, I found a photo album, my wife's.

The latest photo in there was from about a year ago. Our vacation to South Africa. The oldest was from the day she was born. 19 September, 1985. As I scrolled through the album, I noticed something off about her face. I'd know since I've been with her for 15 years (including the dating and engagement period.)


Her jawline was sleek and smooth, on the 5th page in the album, her jaw was slanted to the left, a bit crooked, and her chin was longer. She had braces which she'd never had before, and her ears were smaller.

On the next page, she looked exactly the same as she did when I met her. I was confused. Was it just a glow-up? But the next photo was taken 3 days after the one before.I went up stairs to ask her about the album.

 When she looked at me and saw the album, She charged at me. I ran back down stairs, into the basement where I locked myself. She was slamming the door for a few minutes, before she phased out again, and began mumbling again.
I decided to brush it off, as this HAS been happening for the past few days.

I continue to scroll through the album, her face in some pages, are just.. weirder. I gather the courage to come back outside. I bring 2 pictures of her with me. I hold one up to her face. The "normal" one. She looks different. I thought maybe it was just the time gap.

I go back down, and grab a newer one. I compare it to her face. It's still... Different. I hold the "abnormal" one up to her face. It resembles her. I was confused. Did I forget which one was which? Was I just seeing things? I brush it off, and go back to cleaning the basement.

After about 2 hours, I was basically done, I just had to empty out a small shelf with scraps on it. The shelf was emitting a that sour smell. It seemed to be the source of it, for that matter. I moved the shelf away for the wall and felt something brush me.

I looked up, and saw a deceased hand drooping from the side of the shelf. I screamed loudly. I was mortified. I reluctantly pulled the shelf away, revealing the rest of the body. When I look up, I see my own wife.

I shriek. I quickly move the shelf back to its original position, I stand there shocked. After 5 minutes (or what felt like 5 hours) I hear someone creeping down the stairs. "So, you found it."

I look up, there she stands, my... Wife? "Would you like to join her?" She said, coldly. She charges at me, at an inhumane amount of speed. I manage to dodge, and I sprint out of the room, to the front yard.

I lock the door behind me, I could hear her slamming on the door. I luckily had my phone in my pocket, and dialled the police.

She ran out the back yard and escaped. Just a day after that, they found her eating the body of an innocent civilian. She got arrested, and got charged with 1st degree murder, cannibalism and grand theft auto.

She escaped in somebody else's car. I still don't know how she killed my wife, when she did, or why she did. I've technically been living under my wife's body for 2 weeks.

Before she died, I remember her telling me she had a twin. Maybe her twin killed her, or maybe... It's something for sinister? I just do hope, that she rots in prison.

 

Alrighty, so this story takes place when I was around 12,5 years old, during the Christmas break. For the sake of context, I was a very paranoid kid. Like, the closing every door, constant surrounding check type of paranoid. I also watched a lot of horror movies, so I was making myself go crazy without knowing why. I could have done better at school, but I couldn't keep myself together. My friend Peter was the real MVP on the support while I was on some tough times.

Anyways, that day my grandparents (I was staying with them during the break) decided to go take a walk with me at night. I hesitated for a while, but I ended up agreeing to go with them. Fucking hell, I wish I didn't go. We were going to walk through half of the city they lived in (about 30 min away from their home). When we were coming back, my paranoia started making me go insane. I constantly checked empty streets and closed restaurants. Then I started getting calmer because of my grandparents' comforting skills. I still checked behind us sometimes though.

I started hearing noises after a while. Louder and louder each time. Footsteps. I couldn't help but look behind me once again. Then it hit me. A man with his clothes covered in blood was following us.

\- Grandpa! Grandma! We gotta go! There's a man behind us! I think he's following us... - I said, in a hurry.

\- What do you mean?!- he shouted. - I'm just a man walking during the nighttime! Leave me alone!

I ran for my life, holding my clueless grandparents' hands. We hid in an alley just in time before he could spot us. I stood there, with a blank face. Not scared, not shocked, just empty. 

We went away when the coast was clear, just in time to witness that dude stabbing a couple. Then he turned to us.

\- You're next! - He shouted.

He caught up to us after a few seconds of chasing. All I remember was getting punched and everything going dark. I passed out for a few seconds. When I woke up all I remember was looking to each side. In one side, my grandpa, with quite a few stab wounds. In the other side, my grandma, with a knife in her chest and no other stab wounds. Then I looked up. The guy had been shot dead by police officers.

We got rushed to the hospital as soon as we were spotted. That couple was gone. My grandpa didn't make it. He had seventeen stab wounds. My grandma spent months in the hospital recovering and I was treated and went back to my house just a week later. 

This and the incident over at Peter's compete to the worst days of my life. I don't know which is worse, but I know they were both hell. It feels like I am chosen to go through all of this on purpose. It feels like it's all set up! Fuck this shit, man.

Everything is alright now, since it's been quite a long time. I mean, apart for the trauma part... and the guilt... and the weight...

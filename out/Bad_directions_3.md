Why did I turn left… I could’ve gotten back on the highway and just went back home. 

What would I have told my parents? Or Hollys mom?

What would I tell Hollys girlfriend…?

A few more miles and I started to see street lights, a town, and eventually a saw directions to the university… 

it wasn’t until I got to safety and other actual humans that I was able to notice the drivers seat was wet with hollys urine… I can’t blame her. 

I arrived at the university and I parked my car waaay in the back. Normally as a woman I wouldn’t do this as it isn’t safe but I just couldn’t bear having to explain why the sunroof was ripped off and the windshield cracked and full of murky brown “blood”.  

my parents had set up for Holly and I to have an overnight experience at the university, staying in the dorms. 

I grabbed my duffel bag and hollys too… i didn’t want to leave her stuff in the car to get stolen. 

I was about to head in when I realized I was covered in sweat, small bits of metal and glass and we’ll… hollys piss. 

I grabbed some clothes and changed behind my car as fast as possible, I left the soiled clothes in the trunk. 

I made my way inside, and a college kid at the front desk greeted me and checked my ID. 

“AWESOME, it’s nice to meet you Mindy I’m Grayson and I see here you’re in Hall C room 109, you should be bunking with someone named Holly, who hasn’t checked in yet.”

“Yeah I don’t think she’s coming… “ I whispered 

“We’ll if she doesn’t you’ll have the room all to yourself, so score amirite?” He laughed

I was too traumatized and exhausted by recent events to even reply.  

“Alriiiiiiight… well it looks like I’ll be seeing you tomorrow, im running your tour group around campus!” He said while handing me a key card. “your room is just down that hall and to the left, you’re gonna go up to the 3rd floor and you’ll read the signs from there”


“Thanks Gary” 

“Uh it’s Grayson…”

“Sure, George” I mumbled, walking down the hall, to the left, up the elevator, and following the signs to my room. 

I set down the duffel bags and put my phone on the charger, and hollys phone on the charger too. 
Even tho i did a quick change outside my hair and skin were still disgusting, so i got into the shower… and broke down completely. 

I couldn’t believe what just happened… was it even real?
**
I kept expecting some explanation but from who? 
**
Who would clarify this for me? 
**
And what do I do? 
**
Who would even believe me. 
**
What do I tell hollys parents?
**
It was the hardest night of my life… I kept reliving it every time I closed my eyes. 
I slept in hollys t shirt to feel closer to her. 

I woke up early and went to the university tour in the morning and I don’t even know why. It’s not like I would ever stay in this town after what I saw. I guess I just wanted to feel something normal. 

Maybe I still didn’t believe it happened. 

“Mindy! I’m so glad to see ya!” Grayson piped from across the room. “Welcome aboard the tour. Did your roomie ever make it?” 

“No Gerald, she didn’t” I mumbled

“Uh… it’s Grayson, and that’s cool you got some space to yourself. Anyways, see you in 15 for the tour, enjoy your breakfast!”

I will not enjoy my breakfast, dickweed. 
**
And I did not enjoy my space. 
**
And it isn’t cool that Holly isn’t here. 
**
I felt myself about to cry and ran into the bathroom…

At the end of the tour I asked the tour guide for directions back to the highway that didn’t involve that creepy back road. 

“Yeah the gps will always take you down that road, ignore it, keep going straight and use the toll road instead, so many people go missing on that road. Cars always get abandoned nobody know what happens” he said. 

“Why wouldn’t they just close the road already?” I asked rhetorically on my way out

“There’s a lot more going on here than you’d think” he said solemnly 

Whatever. 

I grabbed all my crap from my room, hollys phone has so many missed calls and texts… my parents have been calling me non stop. I have no idea what to tell them. 

I made my way to Hollys  car and threw all my crap in it.

Just go straight and get the hell out of here. 

I put the key into the ignition, and the car started sputtering. 

Fuck. 

I tried again, and again, and again, and eventually the car began to start smoking. 

I guess I’m stuck here for a while.

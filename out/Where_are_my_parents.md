Where are my parents?

Day 0: Finally a day off from my parents constantly nagging at me. They were going to go on a 2 day 1 night vacation. They would return at 8pm on day 2. I would have the house to myself.

I had already planned of inviting my friends over for a small party which my parents did not know about. “James, here is my credit card. Do not spend it unless it’s an emergency, okay? Also, you better take care of the house and your little sister Jane”, Dad reminded. “Okay okay, now you can go I promise i will be a good boy and take care of Jane!” I assured them before pushing them out of the house.

“Hey Brandon, Trisha and Dean, you can come over now. Their finally gone.” I said on a call with my friends who were coming over for the party. 

Diary: Dear diary, today was a blast. We bought a couple boxes of pizza with Dad’s credit card. Trisha and Brandon are currently in my room, they decided they wanted to sleep over at my house tomorrow they will leave at 7:30pm. Just 30 minutes before Dad and Mom come home. Jane has been good since my friends came over too. She is now sleeping soundly while me, Trisha and Brandon are preparing to go to sleep. I can’t wait for the fun things we will do tomorrow.

Day 1: I woke up. I checked the time on my alarm clock. 7:46am. Turns out that i was the first to wake up. I smiled. I went to check on Jane who was still in her crib snoring away. Then, i cooked up 4 breakfasts for the 4 people in the house. When Trisha and Brandon were awake, they were delighted to see the food i cooked up. When Jane awoke, i carried her to the kitchen and fed her the breakfast. The rest of the day, 4 of us all sat in the living room playing games or watching tv. It was really fun. But at exactly 7:30pm, I hurried Trisha and Brandon out of the house. I cleaned the small mess the party had amounted to before awaiting my parents’ arrival.

Diary: Dear diary, my parents were supposed to return from their vacation an hour ago. They don’t seem to be here yet though. Maybe their stuck in a traffic jam, once i wake up i think they’ll be back by then.

Day 2: My eyes flickered open, i ran out of my room to check if my parents were back yet. Their bedroom was empty. Maybe they’re downstairs making breakfast. Empty. After searching the whole house, i realised it was only me and jane. I dialled my Dad’s number. “Hello, this is an automated message, please send me a voicemail.” I went into voice mail. I was worried. Why were my parents not answering. Nevermind, this was what i wanted, the house to myself!

Diary: It has been exactly 72 hours since my parents left home. Jane seemed to be really tired today as she did not wake up until dinner… Well they will probably return tomorrow.

Day 3: My parents have not come back yet, i’m starting to want them to come back. Jane was still sleeping so i only made my own breakfast.

Diary: My parents aren’t going to come home. Jane is still sleeping till dinner. Please come home.

Day 4: I was starting to hate the absence of my parents. When will they be back. Will they be back? 

Diary: [Empty]

Day 5: I could not take it anymore. I carried the sleeping Jane out the house that we had been trapped in for 4 days. 

I cradled Jane in my arms as i stared blankly into the drive way, waiting for my parents to return to home sweet home.

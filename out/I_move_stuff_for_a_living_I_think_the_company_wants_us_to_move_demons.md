The house was large, and it seemed well kept, at least from the outside, and it looked newly constructed for something made in 1807.

Being in the middle of the countryside, it should have been worn down by the weather, the glare of the sun, and thousands of other such dangers in nature.

And yet, the old house still stood, defiant against the rivers of time.

I put the rental truck to a halt, just outside the old and shiny gates, stepped out, and stretched for a bit, eyeing the odd building as I did. Opposite from me emerged my partner, Cassie.

“Weird house, ey?” she commented.

“Yup,” I agreed, nodding my head.

The giant label, in big red letters on my van read “Antique-Hero! Your #1 Moving Company for All Your Antiques!”

Yeah, that was my job. We moved stuff for a living, going from one place to the next, carefully searching out all possible paths and determining the safest route. It wasn’t a terribly hard job, although we’ve had our share of overbearing customers.

Tonight would be just like any other job. Get into the house, package whatever was left inside the house (another truck had been there earlier), and follow the route another truck had given us, which led to public storage nearby- it’d be a breeze.

Or so we thought.

And so, we began our journey into the house. The gates swung open, unlocked, just as we were promised. We walked up the winding stone path that seemed more like a nuisance than a path, and finally, we arrived at the door.

The door was odd. I remember that it just didn’t sit right with me. 

You know those old door-knockers from the medieval times, the ones that looked like a lion holding a ring which would hold the object used to knock- no, *pound* on the door?.

This was it. Except it didn’t look like anything I’d ever seen before. The thing wasn’t a lion, nor any such animal- rather, it seemed to be of a human’s face, yet distorted and mangled as if something terrible had been done to it. The copper, rusting ring was in its jaws, and what seemed like a cheap plastic stone lay at the bottom of the ring.

“Weird door,” Cassie commented. Then she proceeded to use it, lifting up the copper ring and letting it fall with a thud. The noise seemed to echo in the house, and then rush back outside. “Weird noise.”

“Let’s conveniently ignore that,” I joked. Cassie seemed to agree, and entered in a passcode on a keypad right next to the ancient wooden thing. For all its glamour and weirdness, the fact that it was attached to a rather modern piece of technology tickled me, and I laughed out loud.

Cassie didn’t seem to get it, and so she looked at me with confusion.

“The door,” I began, “the keypad- they just seem so- so different from each other, and yet-”

“I don’t get it,” she reaffirmed.

“Oh well,” I said.

And so, we entered the house. Shadows were in every corner.

When we flicked on the light, an unnervingly candle-like glow flooded the room.

The house was empty, stripped of sofas, tables, and maybe even a piano. Despite the marvelous, ancient look, the house seemed small. And the insides didn’t match the outside, no- this house, at least within, was as modern as they come.

But of course, we didn’t come to admire the house. 

“I’ll take downstairs,” Cassie claimed. “You go take upstairs.”

“Whatever you say,” I decided, heading upstairs, as well as carrying a few cardboard boxes to stuff whatever antiques were left above.

The first room I stepped into seemed to be a music room. The walls were painted with musical staves, as well as notes and rhythms, like sheet music. I looked at the ground to see depressions in the wood where a piano must have sat.

I looked back up and saw three vases, ornate. Then, I tagged them and carefully wrapped and stored them into the cardboard boxes. 

The next room was what once seemed to be a home theater, crossed with an art room. The projector was still left there, and a note that told me not to remove it. There were a few paintings there too, and so I assumed those were the things that needed to be removed.

The paintings were… odd. 

They didn’t seem old or anything, but they were still weird, bizarre- creepy. They all seemed to have a common theme- people wearing masks of all sorts of different kinds- all “human”, each showing a different emotion. Each masked person was in a different place.

There was what was a musician, masked with what seemed like hatred about to slam a knife into an already-bleeding piano. Another one was of an artist, wearing white clothes and the soulless mask of fear, painting what looked like something from a kid’s show- puppets that seemed vaguely familiar, though now lost to childhood.

I decided to ignore the creepy paintings that could have emerged from a nightmare and instead focus on the third and final room.

Like the room before, this one seemed equally mask themed. The room was stripped of all furniture, and it seemed desolate, like the deserts of a future world.

There were six masks there, each matching the six paintings of the people with the masks on. I didn’t like how this was going. 

Below each grim and twisted mask were labels: “Joy”, “Sadness”, “Surprise”, and three others that I could barely make out. They were all different, as if they had been taken from cultures from distant lands- though they all shared a single feature- some sort of eye, closed. Maybe taking the paintings first was a better idea.

As I took the paintings back outside, I saw Cassie, and made a joking comment on how everything in the house must be related to masks.

And that’s when she stopped me, mid sentence. Her eyes were wide, and she seemed shocked.

“Wait,” she paused, “I have to show you something.”

“Okay?” 

Cassie waved her hand, drawing me into a room that was just too bizarre it *still* seems impossible to describe.

It was a room that was made to be like a nursery, one for babies and yet, the cribs were large- almost as if they were laid out for not children, but adults. There were six of these cribs.

But that wasn’t the worst part.

The worst part was that it seemed like someone- or some*thing* still lived there, and was there recently. The room was strewn with rotting stuffed animals, traces of food, and furniture- but the sofas and tables were torn, and some even seemed… chewed.

The previous team never mentioned this. 

“I don’t like this,” I declared. “I don’t think we should stay here- let’s just report this off to-”

I saw a shadow move swiftly, out of the corner of my eye.

I wasn’t sure of it at first, but I growing sensation that something, the shadow, was outside watching us, like a predator.

Cassie didn’t seem to see it. I elected not to tell her about it.

As soon as I saw it, we both heard a noise, like metal being hit, and we rushed to the front door. We looked outside, where the noise had come from, and we watched in horror as we saw two people inside the truck. 

Their faces were too far away to see, but I could swear they didn’t seem to have faces at all. 

Further still- how did they get in? The keys were with me, and nothing seemed broken- it was almost as if they just appeared inside.

“We have to call 911!” Cassie yelped.

I nodded, then swiftly responded with another idea, “I’ll go upstairs- it’ll be easier to watch whoever’s out there.”

Cassie nodded, dialing 911 as I ran upstairs, and into the only room with a good view outside- the mask room.

Just as I was about to reach the window- I stopped. 

Something was wrong with the room- deeply wrong. I cautiously walked back to the collection of masks pinned onto the wall.

“One,” I counted, “two, three-”

*Where were the other three?*

There were six masks before. Right? There were six masks before, just like how there were six paintings, each with masks on the person, and just like below- six beds.

I looked back out through the window. The two people weren’t inside anymore. They were outside, crawling on all fours, like a baby. 

They seemed to be perplexed by the van, almost as if they’d never seen it before. And their faces were unchanged, blank, almost as if-

The masks.

They were wearing the masks. Two of the three missing masks- but how could they have gotten in and-

They were now staring directly up at me, crawling like a child, yet staring up through the windows and into my very soul. They had the masks of ‘Joy’ and ‘Sadness’ on, and they began to act that way, respectively, bringing out the power of the mask.

Further, the eye I had seen inscribed on the mask seemed open, rather than closed as it was before.

And the masks themselves- they weren’t attached to their heads in any way possible- it was like the masks had fused together with their faces, becoming one, until the person and the mask became one being.

In horror, I watched the two dance for what seemed like an eternity. I watched them through the window. I heard the voice of Cassie attempt to call 911- yet the police never seemed to come.

And then, the worst happened.

I began to notice movement, outside the corner of the window. A shadow here, a light there.

It was almost too late when I realized it was another mask, peeking in and out of the glass like a child playing peek-a-boo.

I screamed.

The person- and the mask seemed to mimic me, acting surprised, before jumping in through the window, shattering the glass. 

I ran, taking only a single glimpse as the thing crawled like a baby behind me, smelling like milk and rot. It looked at me, tilted its head, then squealed like a pig.

**SQUEE!**

And then I was downstairs, the thing behind me, much to the shock of an already horrified Cassie.

The 911 operator finally connected, and Cassie began to mumble something incoherent.

The thing behind me continued to advance, so I grabbed Cassie and ran towards the nearest room, locking the door shut as we entered.

That’s when I realized we had locked ourselves in the nursery. The cribs seemed to vibrate with a strange energy in the air, toys seemingly moving on their own. The noise of the thing outside got louder, and it began to paw at the door, letting out a sound- **SSSSKKKK.**

At the window that spanned the nursery, I watched as more of the mask-wearing things emerged. They tapped on the window while acting out the respective emotions they wore.

They all continued, a crescendo with every moment- the taps grew in frequency, the wailing beyond the door got louder, the soft chittering of the things increased, until-

Until it all stopped.

Nothing, until a knock on the door, and a voice.

“Hello? Police here! Cassie?”

I stay calm and steady, aiming carefully while holding my breath. I dared not blink or flinch, I ignored nature's ambience trying to distract me from my goal. As if mother nature herself was trying to throw me off as I prepared to make my move. It ate grass occasionally, stopping to look up and around in worry of predators. A single loud bang went out and echoed through the woods. I reloaded my gun and got out of my hiding spot.

My prize, a dead deer, was laying in a pool of blood as I made a headshot kill. I prefer these as they are quick and painless for the deer, and harder to pull off. I grabbed the deer by the antlers and pulled out my cellphone to take a picture, prepared to eternalize my victory by a photo. I was interrupted by voices of a man and woman talking.

I calmly and carefully stepped through the overgrowth and hid behind a thick tree. “Kyle!” the woman shouted. The man cupped his hands over his mouth to call out “Kyle! Where are you!” The bushes near them started to rumble and shake, the man getting scared and stepping backwards. His right leg was closest to said bush and I witnessed a strange sight.

Something came out of the bush for a split second and bit his thigh causing it to bleed. He yelped in pain and clutched his wound. His heavy breathing and screaming were replaced with a calm silence only a few seconds later. He stood there silently and emotionlessly as his wife tried to console him in any way she could.

“Devan! Devan are you alright! Hello?!” The husband bends over and grabs his wife's leg, yanking it so hard she falls on her ass and he takes off her shoes and socks, while pulling up her right pant leg. She screams in horror as she struggles to get off his tight grip. “What’s gotten into you! Stop, you’re hurting me!”

She tries everything from slapping his hand and trying to pry it open to no avail. I watch as the same creature comes out of the bushes quickly and bites her whole foot causing her to scream in pain. Her husband finally lets go as she cries while clutching her foot as it bled. “What's… wrong… with… you…” Again after a few seconds she fell quiet and got up standing in a thoughtless manner like her husband.

I watched as the creature showed itself, a doe covered in some flowers and over growth, appearing to be made of some weird material. I thought its texture was so coarse and unnatural that I pulled out my phone to zoom in. To my surprise it had a similar texture to that of a tree, I even turned my head silently to inspect the tree I was hiding behind for confirmation on this.

Nonetheless I looked back at the wooden deer who stood there silently. It nodded its head and subsequently the man and woman started to get undressed. When fully naked the deer knelt down and the woman got on first, her husband following suit and holding on to her. The deer got up and moved quickly with unnatural jumps in a zigzag motion similar to normal deer.

When they left I felt it was safe enough to walk out. The situation reminded me of the many pairs of clothing dotting and lying everywhere in a trail to the woods. I was curious and decided to follow them. I walked for 30 minutes through the dark and moist woods, trying to stay as quiet as possible on the dirt paths.

I saw a clearing off the beaten trail and went to investigate. I was so shocked with awe that I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It looked beautiful, a crater in the ground with a waterfall on the right side flowing into a river that went to the left. It was grassy and filled with different types of flowers and plant life.

The man and woman were standing before the wooden deer. There were many white tailed deer around picking up trash and grazing the grass. The other… creatures made me want to puke in disgust. There were hybrids slowly hunching over and some walking on four legs, turning into deer slowly.

There were also naked humans all over the place picking up trash and relaxing in the grass. I pulled out my phone again to get a better view, focusing on Dave and the woman who’s name I didn’t know. The deer nodded its head and the woman and man had begun shaking. Their hands morphed together stickily turning black at the ends like hooves. Their forearms were partially covered in brown fur.

Brown nubs grew on Devan's head and a while later turned into fully formed antlers. They both fell down as their feet shook sporadically and morphed in a melty way like their hands previously. Their human feet retracted into a smaller black cylinder shape, their whole leg structure breaking and bending to that of a deer's.

Their behinds to their face started to morph and grow a coat of deer hair. Their faces both extended and quickly changed color as fur grew out. Their human nose turned black and smaller just like their eyes. The twos skull structure only narrowed and elongated forwards to create a snout as their ears subsequently disappeared into the sides of their heads before a new pair of deer ears grew.

They shook and shivered until before my eyes were two beings no longer human, rather a doe and buck. The wooden deer made an odd noise and the two deer split up in opposite directions to interact with others or help out.

This deer… made of wood was a specimen I had to show to my friends and rivals who also hunt in this area or elsewhere. I would have ultimate bragging rights. I carefully aimed the camera to be a wide panorama of this beautiful location filled with terrifying creatures and deer. I payed no attention to the humans as I wanted to get the fuck out of there once I’m done.

I took a picture and my heart stopped in a millisecond. Sweat dripped down my face and all I could feel was the flushed embarrassment and worry burning and tickling my entire neck and back. A sure sign that I fucked up. I had forgotten the flash was on, and it was bright.

The wooden deer was the first to notice and looked in my direction, staring into my soul even though I was well hidden. The other deer stopped and looked at me, the humans and hybrids did the same. I got out of the bushes and fucking ran for my life. A sharp monstrous scream rang out through the woods sending adrenaline shooting through my damn veins. I jumped onto the dirt path and ran through the crowd of trees in the woods. From behind me I heard galloping turn into an armada of stomps only growing louder and more threatening around me.

The pushing and shaking of plant life in all directions, the rustling and stomping unnerving me more. I looked to my left and saw deer running straight forward. I looked on my right while dodging trees and saw the same thing. I ran onto the path and heard a fierce screech. The stomping shook the ground as I looked behind myself for a split second to see the wooden deer about to bite my arm.

I side stepped and ran around a tree to fake her out, the beast ran forward before stopping to look for me again. The crowd of deer started to close in on me, I pulled out my pistol and shot any that got close to me in the head. I went to the path which had a fork in the road, I went right and kept running towards the clearing where the abandoned camp was.

I didn’t have anything on me that could kill deer too easily, especially not hundreds of them. I pulled out a bear calling whistle and blew as hard as I could to scare off any potential pursuers before they saw me. I jumped as I heard a roar from behind me once more, the ground shook as the creature leapt trying to catch me. There was no fucking way I could out run a deer, especially a monsterized one like that. I pulled out my silenced pistol and shot as many times as I could until I ran out of bullets.

The wooden deer stood there silently, leaves growing over its wounds as I heard loud cracking and mending. I turned left and saw the clearing but stopped to my surprise. There was a blockade of deer at the clearing entrance. The wooden deer, seemingly back to normal, was walking slowly towards me.

I had no choice but to run towards the blockade. I pulled out my rifle and aimed random shots. Some bullets struck heads, necks, bodies, and legs. But no matter how many I injured or killed, more came to take their place. The deer rumbled in anger, glaring at me, coming closer. I tried turning back but more were behind me, led by the wooden deer.I did the only thing I could think of and ran towards the blockade. Deer surrounded me in a massive radius, they put their heads down and simply charged in straight lines. One after another came in random directions trying to knock me down. I didn’t try to force my way through the deer, I simply jumped onto the tree and started climbing.

I jumped down from the tree and kept running after getting past the blockade. I thought I was free before I turned left to go towards the parking lot. The wooden deer rammed my left side so hard I flung 5 feet in the air and rolled down the small hill, almost falling into the pond water.

I couldn’t breathe, I waited for a few moments to rest before trying to sluggishly get up. I felt the most intense pain I had ever felt in my life which made getting up excruciatingly worse, and difficult. I climbed up the hill of the pond and looked to the woods. I saw the wooden deer standing there, staring at me.

The armada of deer were right behind it. The deer ran back as the humans started to turn into deer as well. I puked on the ground and wiped my mouth, everything was dizzy and sweat dampened my whole body and clothes. After what seemed like an eternity I got to my car. I started it up and looked back, the wooden deer was alone now, and still looking into my soul.

I drove home while playing some music to try and get my mind off things. I silently cried, thanking the lord that I escaped with my life. I couldn’t comprehend what was happening there, and I didn’t want to fucking know.

30 minutes later I pulled into my driveway and limped inside my home. I grabbed a trash bag and started placing all my hunting equipment, trophies, and other stuff inside. I took down my prized deer head on a plague and put it in a bag as well. I called 911 to send an ambulance as I laid on my couch, crying profusely.

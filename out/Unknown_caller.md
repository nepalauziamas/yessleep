Hey Marie, I am sorry about the other night, I was drunk, and you were not around, besides, she practically begged me to do it. That was the only time it happened, I promise it won’t happen again, so can you please answer? 02:38am

Missed voice call at 02:41am

Ok fine, Il tell you the truth it happened one more time, while you were away at your mom's funeral last year a girl called to the door, she was lost, so I invited her in and one thing led to another. What was I supposed to do? I swear that’s everything and I will make it up to you. 02:41am

I don't know why your being like this, I said I'm sorry what more do you want. 02:49am

Just answer the phone and stop being a bitch, Marie. What about the Tracy “accident” you didn’t call me then did you, you were gone for two days? And I forgave you. 02:51am

Missed voice call at 02:53am

Ok, maybe I am overreacting, just a little bit, it's only because I love you so much and I can't handle it when you're angry with me. But I got a present to make it up to you, and you are going to love it. Guess what it is, Il give you a clue, it begins with J and smells like blueberries. 02:55am

I can't wait forever; I will have to start without you. 02:56am

Really. I'm starting to get sick of your attitude, fucking answer, NOW! 03:02am

Look, you know how much I love you and without you my life is not worth living. Please, I need you. 03:02am 

I can't believe your like this after all I did for you, you thankless Bitch. I dragged you from the gutter and made all your dreams come true. Now you're willing to throw it all away over a piece of meat. You will never survive without me.  03:04am

What else do you want me, I told you everything, I apologized, I even got you a present which I may add, has caused nothing but problems for me, and all I get is shit for thanks. 03:09am

Do you have any idea how long it took to set up your surprise, a bit of gratitude would be appreciated? I had to go there every day for a week before she would even talk to me, I don’t even like pie.  03:10am

We are waiting for a long time to find someone that looks like your mother, and her name is Jessica too, what are the chances? Don't ruin this for us. 03:11am

Okay, so I’m gonna try to make this quick. He’s coming back soon. I’m not really sure where we went wrong. Well, I should start at the beginning, I guess. So, a few months back I moved out of my parents place. I didn’t have a lot of money saved up, so I could really only get a place in the worst part of town. This building seemed like the safest place in the part of town I had to move to, and I refuse to go back to my parents. Everything was fine, except the rent was pretty high. I put out an ad for a roommate on all the places I could think of, and I finally got a hit on Craigslist. That really should’ve been red flag number one, now that I think of it.

He seemed like an alright dude. His name was Jackson, and there was about two years of age difference between us. Him being 25 and me being 23. I know, I know, I should’ve moved out a long time ago. That’s another story. But, everything was okay for a few months like I mentioned before. He would come home late in the day, sometimes at night, and he’d leave early in the morning. I personally would not want that job. Anyways. He seemed to have the weekends off, so it was an okay situation, at least he never complained about it. So, on the weekends we would go and get something to eat, hang out at places, or just eat at home. This is where my problems started with him.

For some unknown reason, he never picked up after himself. He’d leave his trash by the front door never taking it out, to the point that whatever in the bag would start to rot. I really don’t know why I never checked the bags. I should have checked the bags. He’d leave his dishes in the sink, and whenever I washed them, the water would turn a murky brown color. These were all only knives and sharp objects. Why didn’t I notice that before? Anyways, I refused to wash them because it was just disgusting, and he should be able to clean up after himself. Whenever I brought it up to him, he’d get angry, and storm into his room, muttering something about “getting caught”, and ”police”. I just brushed it off like he was crazy, which he probably is, in hindsight.

This made me afraid to bring it up to him. I was still fine with him being in the apartment, after all, he was on the lease. I didn’t really have a choice BUT to be okay with it.

Another weird thing. He never wanted to watch the news. If we were watching TV and the news came on, he would either turn the TV off or change the channel. When he isn’t around, I look up the stories for that day. Stuff about murder. Maybe he’s got PTSD and that stuff triggers him? I don’t know. It definitely doesn’t sit right with me though. Maybe I’m overreacting. I’m not really sure what to make of this situation.

When we go out in public, he’s always wearing a mask and sunglasses, as if he’s afraid to be seen. He never wants to go places with a lot of people. He would rather stay at home. I’m a homebody to an extent, but even I like to go out sometimes. I really don’t get it, i just don’t. It’s like he’s a murderer or something, lol. I doubt that’s the case, I would’ve noticed. Or would I have? Thinking back on it, maybe he is. I mean, it all lines up. I’m probably just overreacting though. Right? Yeah. I’m overreacting.

I just can’t get over the thought. I don’t know what to do. Another thing that’s weird- he spends hours in the basement of the apartment complex. I’ve asked the owner of the building if he’s okay with this, and he seems to have no problems. He seemed nervous when I asked though. He said that he heard some commotion in the alleyway by the apartment, and when he went to check it out, he saw my roommate hurting someone. He said he got away without my roommate seeing him, but he’s still scared that my roommate saw him. He then asked my landlord for the keys to the basement. Not wanting to get hurt, he gave them to my roommate.

I wanted to investigate but I don’t want to risk it. What if I get caught? Or what if because of my paranoia, an innocent person dies in the basement? I would rather just not attempt it. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared that he’ll find this. I want to kick him out but the manager of the apartments seems scared of him, and by what he said, for good reason. I think I should be too. I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared that he’ll see this post. I’m afraid that he’s going to do something bad.

Should I go to the police about this? What if they find something, or worse, they don’t, and I’m just crazy, and the one that falsely accused his roommate of murder. What happens then? I don’t know what to do. I’ve been watching the news closely for a story about a murderer, but nothing. 

I think I’m going to confront him. If I don’t update, I’m dead. I really hope I'm just paranoid. Oh god, he’s here. He’s unlocking the door to the apartment. I have to go. These may well be my last words. If they are, I love you mom. I’m sorry I was such a bad son. I love you. Goodbye, hopefully not forever.

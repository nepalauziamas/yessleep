It was like the last week of summer. In my island there is a hill around 150 meters tall that I had never heard about and I was curious to see what was up there. So I had the pretty smart idea to just go there and explore it with my two best friends. We were all 13 years old back then and we were stupid asf. One afternoon we met at my friends house and we started to walk there. We walked 10 minutes and then we were next to the hill. At this point there was nothing around us, not a single house, just a road. We kept walking on the road which was leading to the top but then we saw a path that seemed to lead on the top too. 

We chose to follow the path but after a few meters it stopped and there was just rocks. I wanted to go back and go to the top from the road but my friends said that it would be more fun if we climbed to the top, dump I know, but I couldn't just leave them. While we were climbing we noticed that the hill was surrounded by razor wires and we saw three small old buildings at the top. We thought that the place was abandoned so we thought that it would be ok if we sneaked in, also really dumb. After climbing some meters up we had to get through the razor wires in order to get back to the road and go at the top. The razor wires were like 2 meters tall and 1 meter wide. However there was a point were they were nearly destroyed and and you had to get through a 70 cm tall razor wire. It sounds easy but it's not, the wires were really sharp and we were afraid. We were just looking at them for 5 minutes trying to find a safe way to get past them. Then I just stepped on the wire bringing it to the ground and I carefully got to the other side. My friends did the same and then we had only to follow a road with a lot of turns to get to the top. 

The view was amazing, u could see the whole island! We were all excited asf except the friend that always acts like a tough guy, he was so frightened hahahaha. We kept walking up, we passed from the buildings I told u about before ( they were empty ) and then we finally reached the top. There we realised where we were at. Everything in the south was protected by razor wires for hundreds of meters. The road we where supposed to follow to get to the top was blocked by a tall fence and protected by a guard. We could also clearly see every fucking warship and whatever was going on in the naval base which was behind the hill. And guess what, we didn't give a shit! We explore the place and chilled talking and staring at the sea for like half an hour. There was a small column is whose top were written some words I could understand and the number 1969. 

After that we run down the road like 5 year olds because it was getting dark and then got down just like we got up. After we went home. I was exhausted but stayed awake for some hours because I wanted to know what was going on there, I found out that this place was used by soldiers back in 1969 to map the island because the view was amazing from there as I told you before. I also discovered how big my island's naval base is and that it's the biggest in the country. I don't know how the fuck we managed to get in there without getting caught but what I know is that it was fantastic! 


PS:I hate to be that guy but sorry if my English is bad or if you don't understand something, I tried to explain everything the best I could.

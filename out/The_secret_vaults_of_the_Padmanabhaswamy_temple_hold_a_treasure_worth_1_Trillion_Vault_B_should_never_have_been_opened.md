The Padmanabhaswamy temple might just be India's greatest mystery. Located in Thiruvananthapuram, the bustling capital city of the southern state of Kerala, it's been flitting in and out of the news for over a decade. 

Because of its treasure, of course. Arguably the greatest one ever found.

It is a beautiful temple, an exquisite amalgamation of two distinct styles of architecture. By far its most recognisable feature is the *gopuram*, the multi-storied trapezoidal gateway that turns gold when bathed with sunlight. The tall gateway has open passageways at its centre, one on each floor, so perfectly aligned that when the sun sets on an equinox, you can see it winking through each of these holes at five minute intervals. The most intricate stucco sculptures have been carved into every inch of its walls. 

But the beauty and the architectural marvels of its superstructure are not what make the temple special. No, the true source of its infamy lies *beneath* it, in its eight underground vaults.

The temple is over a thousand years old. Through those long years, devotees, rich and poor, peasants and kings have offered tributes to its deity, Lord Vishnu. Tributes that trickled into these vaults and eventually ballooned into a jaw dropping treasure.

Strenuous efforts have been made to make a record of this wealth, and we've had a fair measure of success at that. The ballpark figure of $1 Trillion was reached after such extensive accounting. In fact, almost all vaults have been quite thoroughly researched by now. All except one. 

Vault B.

Located near the Ayappa shrine and beneath the sanctum sanctorum, Vault B has long been shrouded in mystery. It is said to hold an incredible treasure and a terrible curse within its walls. The internet is abound with pictures of its door. Adorned with sinister carvings of twining snakes and topped by a demon's head with its tongue hanging out of its snarling mouth, the thick iron door has no obvious way of opening it. No locks, no latches, no handles, nothing. It is believed that only an accomplished *Sadhu* can open this vault, using magical chants and spells.

Not to say that it *cannot* be opened at all. There have been rumors in the past of the vault being opened and a terrible curse befalling those who entered it. They all supposedly fell to violent deaths, tragedies too terrible to be accurately retold.

But I can state, authoritatively, that as long as the temple has stood, it has only been opened once. In 2020.

I know. Because I was there.

It was Covid-19 that accorded us the opportunity. A nationwide lockdown began on 25th March, and lasted months. The temple that would usually be teeming with devotees turned desolate. One couldn't get a better chance to carry out clandestine research. Away from the prying eyes of reporters and those who hold a bit too much with superstition. 

The conspirators needed a historian, and who else could be better than an Associate Professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University's Centre For Historical Studies? One who would do anything to be involved in a project like this. 

So that's how that muggy mid-June afternoon found me at the forlorn Padmanabhaswamy temple, face slick with sweat, a white mask plastered to my mouth and a Nike bag slung over my shoulders. Flanked by two policemen wearing Khaki uniforms and brown cotton masks, Arun Nambiar, from the Archeological Survey of India, met me near the colossal gateway to the temple. He was thin and short, with wiry grey hair and soft skin under a sharp chin partially hidden by a blue scrap of a mask. 

"Mr Khanna!" He said, the flesh around his eyebrows stretching with a smile. He offered me a handshake before suddenly remembering we were in the middle of a pandemic. "We've been waiting for you. I hope you had a pleasant journey."

"As pleasant as can be expected these days." I said, then my eyes drifted over to the two cops. "Will it just be the two of us?"

"Besides these gentlemen, you mean? I have two interns with me. They're waiting for us at the Vault."

My cheeks burned, and not just from the humid heat. "I hope you didn't have to wait for too long."

He laughed. It was boisterous, though a bit muffled by the mask. "Please, it's fine. We couldn't have started without the man who authored the legendary paper on Kushan Numismatics."

I grinned. "Co-authored." 

As we made our way over to Vault B, Mr. Nambiar told me about how hard it had been to get the project approved, what with the pandemic and bureaucratic red-tapism and the superstitions surrounding the vault slowing everything down to a crawl. Not to mention the descendants of the Travancore royal family, the one who had restored the temple a couple hundred years ago, breathing down hard on his neck. He was telling me about the Supreme court appointed committee that had overseen the opening of the other vaults when we slipped around the Ayappa shrine and began our descent down the stone steps to Vault B. His interns had joined us on the way, Arpita and Jayesh, two PhD students in their late twenties.

Soon we found ourselves in front of the door to Vault B.

It was a metal-grille door.

Rusted, but still sturdy.

"Not quite like the internet, is it?" Arpita mused.

"Of course it isn't. This one is just the door to the antechamber." Mr. Nambiar said, then gestured at us to make way for the cops. One of them produced a thick iron key and slid it into the lock. And turned it with a loud clang. The door squealed on its hinges, revealing a thick wooden door, which in turn led to another iron door.

"This one was jammed shut." Mr. Nambiar said. "We had to get a professional locksmith to get it opened."

My heart beat against my ribcage. It was really happening. One of the greatest mysteries was going to resolve itself in front of my eyes. 

As the second iron door opened with a metallic groan, a cold, musty and decidedly unwelcoming draft washed over us. Dust motes shivered in the weak daylight that spilled onto the stone floor. It was dark inside the low-roofed chamber. We couldn't really see much, not until Jayesh brought out the halogen lamp. The cramped room lit up with the harsh yellow glow. I saw shadows fleeing under the wrath of the lamp as I ducked into the room. 

Everything glittered.

It truly looked like a treasure room. Albeit a small one. Rotted jute sacks spilled silver coins onto the floor, wooden chests lined the walls, some with their lids open, revealing gold jewellery studded with rubies and emeralds and other sparkling gemstones. Glazed and polished pottery, gold pots and bars, ivory toys and idols, inlaid with silver, were piled into the corners. A quick look revealed the history in this treasure. I could see gold coins from the 15th century Vijaynagar empire as well as from the 9th century Cheras. Hell, Arpita even spotted a dented Satavahana coin made from lead.

I would have loved to stay there and sort through the various trinkets and ornaments in the antechamber. But that's not what we were there for. No, something far more compelling beckoned us.

The terrifying door to the inner rooms of Vault B, with its monstrous guardian snakes and the snarling demon's head. It loomed over the room, eating up half the space in the wall it was attached to. The sight of it left me breathless. I'm sure it had a similar effect on the others, for we were all staring at it in awe.

"Well, does anyone know any *mantra-tantra?*" I asked, my voice softer than I had intended. "Any magic spells?" It broke the tension, eliciting some good natured, almost relieved laughter.

"No." Mr. Nambiar said. "But we have something just as good."

He said something to the two cops in Malayalam, who then exited the vault and came back with crowbars. The sounds of scuffing boots and huffing men and iron dragging and slipping on iron followed. Then another, a more satisfying one, metal squealing and scraping on stone, as the door was forced open. Immediately my nose was attacked by a most loathsome stench. Reminded me of the smell of rainwater rotting in abandoned air conditioners, of moldy, unheated storerooms untouched by sunlight. And something else too. Just a hint of burnt wood. What? How? 

The light from the halogen lamp didn't penetrate the darkness in the space beyond the door. Like it was slamming, uselessly, into a thick wall of shadows.

I pulled my flashlight out of my bag, switched it on and pointed it at the darkness. It was a powerful flashlight, bright enough to man the ramparts of a high security prison. Here though, it seemed ineffectual, weakly splashing on the wet stone of the passage ahead. Seemed like the dark had sapped it of all life. Maybe the battery was dying, I thought as I slapped at its metal frame. Jayesh cursed as his eyes took the full force of the flashlight. 

*There it is,* I thought as I took another stab at the darkness beyond the inner door to Vault B. The light wilted, again. 

"Interesting." Mr. Nambiar muttered. "Very interesting."

"An architectural trick?" I said. "Maybe the walls are lined with some strange mineral that absorbs light."

"Maybe." He said. "Now I'm very intrigued. Wonder what lies at the end of this passage."

"Only one way to find out."

We entered the passage, one after the other. One of the cops took the lead, then Mr. Nambiar, followed by me and then the two interns. The other cop brought up the rear. There was more than enough space in the passage to walk with comfort, yet it felt suffocating. The darkness seemed to press up against us, pushing back the light like it was an alive, sentient thing. The air was thick, and even a cautious walk left me breathless.

"It's really weird." Arpita whispered into my ear. 

"What is?" I asked. 

"The walls," She said, "they're made of wood." 

I opened my mouth to tell her maybe wood had been used to reinforce the passage, but stopped. There was just something about the way she'd said it. I stretched my arm out, let my fingers brush against the wall.

The hair on the back of my neck stood up. She was right. It *was* wood. And not smooth wood, like human hands had worked on it, but rough. Uneven, like the sopping wet bark of a tree. Some *colossal* tree. I shivered at the thought.

We continued walking. The passage meandered, turning left, then right, but always sloping downwards. Gently, yes, but unquestionably downwards.

I heard Jayesh's voice behind me. "How long is this thing? Is it even possible for the temple to have something this vast beneath it?"

"It *is* possible." Mr. Nambiar answered, loudly. Made me wince. "Just incredibly strange."

Jayesh mumbled something incomprehensible in response.

We continued walking. For what seemed like hours, each second grinding against the previous one on its way over to the next. The darkness funneled around the cones of weak light spilling out of our flashlights, cut through our clothes, whittled down our spirits. There was a noticeable slump in our shoulders, yet we continued walking. The sounds of boots shuffling on stone and our laboured breathing were the only thing keeping the repressive silence at bay.

Then, after half an eternity, a voice shattered the quiet like a truck hurtling through a sheet of glass. "I see something ahead."

It was the policeman in the lead.

"What is it?" I called out. 

"Light." Mr Nambiar answered. "Maybe an opening in the passageway."

I heaved a sigh of relief. A strange fear had begun to set in, that the tunnel would never end, that the way behind us had been devoured by the shadows, and that we had been cursed to stumble through this cold and dark passage for all eternity. The muscles in my thighs and calves pulsed as I covered the final stretch, blinking rapidly when I saw the light. 

A stone awning above the opening of the passage was preventing most of the light from reaching us. But enough breached the darkness for us to become aware of its unnaturalness. 

It was pale, like moonlight. Shining, in all its alien glory, many metres beneath the surface. 

As I switched my emaciated flashlight off and stepped out of the passage and into the clearing, my jaw dropped at the sight in front of me. The clearing was small, about half the size of a basketball court, but round with a high, rocky ceiling. A ceiling that was studded with strange luminescent stones arrayed in dizzying patterns. They bathed the clearing in a wash of ethereal white glow. It made me feel like I was in a dream. 

But those stones weren't even close to being the most bizzare thing in the clearing. No, that honor went to the tree standing in the centre. It was tall enough to brush against the ceiling. Had a sturdy brown trunk, slender branches engulfed by healthy green leaves and bearing clusters of green flowers that resembled ripe little fruits.

"It's an *Iluppai* tree." Mr. Nambiar said, awe turning his voice soft.

"What's that?" Jayesh asked as he walked close to the tree and studied it. 

"A *mahua* tree." I said, moving to join him in his inspection. "That's what we call it up north. Its flowers are used to make alcoholic drinks by tribals across the country."

"And it has some significance for our temple as well." Arpita said, pulling a DSLR out of her bag. "Question is, how the hell is it growing this deep underground?"

"True. There's no sunlight here." I said. "It *shouldn't* grow."  

"Yet it is… Those stones." Mr. Nambiar said. "They must be responsible for this." 

"What even are they?" I asked. "Have you ever seen anything like them?" 

He shook his head. "No. Can't say that I have." 

"Well, Mr. Nambiar," I said, "maybe you needed geologists and botanists more for this treasure hunt than a historian."

Shadows danced across his gaunt face as he turned to reply to my little quip, but he was cut off by the tree. Which, well, shivered. Its branches trembled. Green leaves rained dust down upon us. The trunk groaned, like a ship rocking on a wave. 

We jumped away from the tree.

"What the hell just happened?" Arpita asked, shaken.

"Maybe the ground shook. An earthquake." Jayesh offered, not quite believing himself.

Before I could tell him just how ridiculous that explanation was, another sound issued from the tree. A sharp crack, like wood splintering. Sweat trickled down my brow as I noticed a long gash in the middle of the trunk. It was splitting open. I could see shadows writhing in the crack, shadows that reminded me of the passage. Rustling of dry leaves followed and then a hand shot out of the wound in the tree.

"What the fuck!" I swore. Almost as one, we all jumped back, pressed ourselves up against the walls of the clearing.

The hand was small, frail, and black as coal. It was covered in grime and looked like it belonged to a little boy.

Then the rest of the boy followed. Another arm, a leg and then a small bald head, before the boy fully hauled himself out of his broken wooden cage, stumbling onto his knees in front of us. Naked. He moved on all four limbs, like a beast, turning his head sharply and glaring at each of us in turn, white teeth bared, tar-like eyes full of malevolence. Before we could even begin to wrap our heads around what we had just witnessed, the boy let out a terrible throaty scream, one that made us fall down to our knees, wincing in pain and clapping our hands on our ears.

Then the boy ran, out of the clearing and up the passage we had just come from.

The shadows swallowed his screams, leaving us all in shocked silence.

Deep in the vast desert expanse of the Nevada desert, far, far away from any small towns or the prying eyes of civilians, there’s a place called the The Ninth Circle Of Hell, or more commonly known as just ‘The Ninth Circle’. It’s a massive underground complex resembling a massive bunker sprawling at least a mile wide and a hundred feet beneath the surface, extremely fortified, and monitored 24/7 by dozens of satellites and cameras. The underground prison can take a direct hit from a nuclear bomb and still keep its prisoners contained. The entire complex is specifically designed to be virtually inescapable, with only one major break-out back in 2005. The cells sometimes differ based on the temperament, aggressiveness, or threat level, but the standard cell is fortified to all hell.

Each cell is at the end of a hallway with several extremely fortified three-foot-thick steel doors that can only be opened using electronic locks. Behind those doors, there’s a classroom-sized standard prison cell with virtually unbreakable walls, and dozens of cameras inside to constantly monitor the prisoner’s movements. At a moment’s notice, the prison cell can be filled with nerve agents and gas designed for chemical warfare, but these usually only slow down the prisoners in case of a breakout. Outside their cell, are several guards in mechanized exoskeletons constantly monitoring the prisoner, but everyone knew the utter bullshit of that procedure.

There's a few hundred regular guards, but there’s a few particular ones that are feared throughout the prison, for their… past. The few elite guards around here are constantly rotating, either retired or active-duty super-soldiers whose previous job was to kill unholy monsters, demons, and gods. We’ll come back to them later… Let's talk about the prisoners. Most, if not all, the prisoners kept in the Ninth Circle facility/prison have the individual capability to destroy a small town if left unchecked. Half of the prisoners are ‘Unkillables’, or ‘The Unkillable’, a collective name for any super-soldiers, people with superhuman abilities, or people with extraordinary abilities. The other half is mainly composed of extremely dangerous people, entities, creatures, beings, parasites, objects, or in some cases, groups of creatures. Why the United States government and the Department Of Supernatural And Cryptozoological Defense (DOSACD) wants to keep the prisoners alive instead of making their own roster of super-soldiers destroy them, I’ll never know.

Frankly, even someone like me has a much higher clearance level over a regular soldier, but I know for an absolute fact that the people overseeing this entire fucking operation are hiding a lot of stuff from a disposable, expendable guard like me. Ever since the Pacific Holy War war against K’lah Tegothlku which happened back in 2019, we’ve had a lot more prisoners, a few especially powerful monsters we managed to capture and wrangle back into this facility. My knowledge is only that each one of the prisoners in here has some sort of significance or use to the various organizations in our country and allied ones, whatever that might be. For now, I’ll explain the history of the Ninth Circle.

It was first founded and built in 1984 by a man named Kalhoon Willink, who at that time was the co-leader of DOSACD, and a very powerful, hidden member of the military and government. It was only a few years before his retirement when he worked with his son, Lucius (more popularly known as The Overseer) and built the prison with extreme support and guidance from the government. The entire operation was kept under wraps, and the construction took nearly a decade before the facility was finished and ready for use. Still, this went way back, it was around the thirties and fifties that the US government and others noticed and put an emphasis on the previously present and rising hostile activity coming from supernatural beings, god-like entities, monsters, and ‘demons’. That led to organizations being secretly made by the government and military such as DOSACD, which eventually led to the need for a maximum security prison capable of holding and containing extremely dangerous people and creatures for research and further knowledge. The prison gained more and more inmates, as super-soldiers from the United States fought and brought in horrifying entities and creatures from the deep. Which leads to as of now, as we just got our newest inmate…

And I was going to have to assist them while they transport it, him, her, whatever, into its cell.

My name is Apollo O'Brien.

I’ve been a guard at the Ninth Circle for several years, and I’ve grown accustomed to living, sleeping, and staying at the prison 24/7. For being nicknamed The Ninth Circle Of Hell, it isn’t really that much of a bad place, at least for the guards. The real hell would break loose if any one of the inmates broke out. As for why and how I ended up being a guard in this sunlight-deprived facility, let’s just say I owed an old enemy a couple favors and a deal after I made some extremely drastic mistakes. That being said, most guards here are retired Tier One operators from all over the world, both retired and active-duty DOSACD agents, or people from all walks of hell.

As for me, I was dealt the cards that ended up with me working here specifically because of my physical prowess. I was naturally gifted with extreme strength, speed, reflexes, and pure athleticism, and after a few unwilling experiments, I was strong and skilled enough to be a very low-tier Unkillable. I wasn’t officially recognized or hired by DOSACD as one of their super-soldiers mainly because of my track record, but was a perfect fit for the prison. And that was one of the reasons I was specifically chosen to guard and assist the arrival of a new inmate. From what I had heard, this new one was a fucking menace.

The hour before the inmate’s arrival, I was monitoring the internal footage of the cells last night when I heard on my radio to go to the warden’s office immediately. I sighed as I got up, and walked out of the surveillance room, and down the hall to the other side of the prison, walking past cell doors every two dozen meters, as I got in the staff elevator and went a few floors up. A few minutes later, I found myself in the warden’s office, as he stood behind his desk, smoking a genuine cuban cigar and taking a puff when he spotted me. The warden was a giant of a man, six-foot-seven, dark skin and a buzzcut, built like a brick shithouse, and deep scars covering his entire face and body from his days hunting monsters and gods of the deep. He had one hell of a track record around these parts, he had fought, beat, and captured several of the inmates himself, despite lacking any real superhuman powers.

“Apollo,” he said. “We got an hour before our new arrival, and Smith and the other suits are freaking the fuck out. The way they describe her, she’s a fucking demon. See for yourself.”

He handed me a large file containing a small stack of papers and I opened it, instantly reading over the pictures, stats, and descriptions of this particular person. I’ll quickly list a few quick key details of this particular Unkillable.

NAME: Cerberus Malefius

HEIGHT: 5’8

WEIGHT: 149 pounds

GENDER: Female

NATIONALITY: Unknown, though has common Irish traits and accen

BORN: Allegedly in 1998, twenty-five years old

Cerberus was a demonic entity who was allegedly from an alternate dimension, or some sort of unnatural space on earth. Her father, though we didn't have much information about him, was one of the most dangerous and powerful entities known to the our database. His name was Abaddon The Destroyer, a being who hopped in and out of our dimension, wreaking utter havoc wherever he went. After Task Force Nova Compass Hunter was sent to investigate the reports of Cerberus destroying a small village, she was nearly killed, then captured, detained, and brought over here.

Her main powers came from her insane primal and genetic agression, intelligence, strength, speed, durability, and most of all, the uncanny ability to use surrounding supernatural and occult forces in combat. She was allegedly the last living descendant of some kind of ancient demon race hailing from deep cave systems under Siberia, though looking like a normal woman, her true form was allegedly more horryfing than anything on earth.

That’s all that was on her file before I handed it back to the warden and nodded at him.

“I’ll be waiting at the processing chamber for when she comes." I said.

\*\*\*

An hour later, I was fully suited up in my bombproof riot gear, with dozens of other guards armed with automatic rifles, shotguns, and flamethrowers. We were all standing on either side of a massive hallway, where at the end was a gigantic elevator supposed to bring down the new inmate. We were all instructed to kill the inmate immediatley if things went south, and my preffered weapon for that occasion was a massive, black one-sided longsword with a tanto tip and groove. Sweat dripped down my forehead as I could hear the sound of the elevator at the end of the hallway whirring, until it stopped, and the door slowly slid open, revealing a massive cage resembling a steel shipping container with dozens of locks and steel rods holding it.

We all stood in formation, ready for the inmate to pounce and rip our throats out as two of my fellow guards worked the locks on the container, and they both opened the doors to the container, revealing the prisoner. My eyes widened as I saw her, Cerberus. She was around five-foot-eight, with white hair tied into a messy bun, pale porcelain skn, sharp teeth, and furious red eyes. She had a translucent muzzle around her mouth, and her arms were handcuffed and tied with parachute cords, while her legs were shackled together. Several guards were holding ropes tied to her muzzle, keeping her still. We locked eyes for a moment and she stopped shouting, and I was frozen. Her gaze was… pleasant, as if I was looking into the eyes of someone I knew a long, long time ago. I nearly tripped, snapping out of it. She was screaming and swearing at us, trying to claw and bite us as I rushed in to stop her from breaking free.

I grabbed her arms and struggled to hold her still as I held the blade of my sword to her neck and walked her to the elevator at the opposite end of the hallway.

"Fucking bitch!!" She yelled trying to elbow me but not moving too much as I held the oversized sword to her jugular.

"Calm down," I said. "It's nothing personal. Just doing my job."

She suddenly snapped her head back, and my heart pounded as my nose slightly cracked, and she pushed my sword away and jumped back, kicking me in the stomach and sending me reeling back. At once everyone in the room opened fire on her, but the bullets barely did any significant damage. A fifty-caliber sniper rifle shot through her chest and she seemed annoyed, lunging at the nearest guard while I grabbed her and put her in a rear-naked choke. She fought and tried biting through my armor as I told the other guards to cease fire. She slowly went limp and eventually passed out, before we finally managed to put her in a blacked-out cage for transport.

"We got a real wild one," one of my colleagues, Ollie, muttered as he walked past me, holding his AR-15.

A dozen other guards and I, the only present superhuman, put Cerberus in the transport elevator, as we descended into the lower levels, calm elevator music played through the elevator speakers. I reached into my vest pocket and pulled out my radio, talking to the warden.

"New arrival Cerberus is secure," I said. "No major problems, taking her to her cell immediately."

"Fuck you," Cerberus groaned, waking up and looking at me with malice. She was definitely pissed. "As soon as you fucking pigs slip up, I'm getting out of here."

"Sure," I sighed. "That's what they all say, you know."

Yeah, I'll admit, I was being an an asshole to our new arrival. Looking back, I was talking like an emotionless robot, but to be fair, I was extremely desensitized and didn't really show much sympathy to the inmates we had here. Well, that was way before I had any idea of the relationship the two of us would have…

"Apollo," one of the guards, Carl (an ex-captain of a notorious sea-monster hunting ship). "Stay on your fucking A-game, we're not done yet."

"Right," I said, snapping out of the haze. What the fuck was wrong with me? I was usually always in the moment during these kinds of operations.

The elevator doors slid open as we entered the main containment facility. It was a massive, five-story room several times the size of a gymnasium with stairs and elevators leading to the upper prison cells, with walkways and catwalks right above us. As soon as we entered the main prison, the sounds of shouting, screeches, roars, unholy shrieks, and roaring heavy metal music flooded my ears. We had a designated cell for Cerebus, and we could hear the shouts of the inmates screaming at us and Cerebus as we opened the vacant cell, unlocked the several other internal doors, and set a timer on the electronic handcuffs and shackles on her hands and feet to release a minute after we had left and secured her cell.

"Apollo," the warden said through the radio. "You're going to have to do the prisoner interview tomorrow, alright?"

"Sure," I said. "Can't wait."

I sighed with exasperation as the guards dispersed, and I left for the lunch room to go on [break.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SeasideUniverse/comments/xscdtw/the_complete_seaside_trilogytimeline_in_order/)

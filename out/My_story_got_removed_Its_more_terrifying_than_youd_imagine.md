*I posted this story here because I thought this was a fan sub. I was wrong about that. I know that makes no sense. It will.*

There’s a place not far from Islamorada where the fish scream as the sun slides up from the horizon in the east. It only lasts for a moment, a cold, glassy shriek and then…quiet. My buddy, Carmine, calls it a *sonorous omen*, a pretty sounding phrase for what I’d long considered a crock of shit. But on June 28th, 2021, I believed for a fleeting second in that whispered piece of mariner’s mysticism. And then, just like that, I was flying through the warm Florida breeze at 120 miles per hour. 

Naturally, I was coked to the fucking gills, Steppenwolf blasting through 10 crystal clear Bose speakers, as a pair of lovely Eastern European lips worked the first and only three inches of my barely turgid cock. It was what one might call a South Florida waking dream. A pinnacle moment in a life well-spent. Perfect in every way apart from the gravity. A leased Porsche Cayenne just isn’t meant for air time. But goddamn if the quickly approaching sea wasn’t absolutely fucking beautiful. 

I survived, obviously. Katya or Karina or whatever the fuck her name was, she—you know what, fuck it—she lived! Why not? Life is a goddamn moonbeam and we’re all caught in its radiance. *Optimism*. Magical thinking. Whatever you wanna call it, I’ve had it by the kilo. Giving it out is actually kinda my job. Maybe the rock and roll lifestyle clued you in... 

You’ve guessed what I do, right?

Answer: ___________

You’re goddamn right. I’m a fucking children's book author. For Little Acorn Press, no less—the Studio 54 of youth publishing in the seldom vaunted Book Belt of the Southeastern United States.  And it’s true what they say about my business; it is all fast lane, cocaine and champagne. Life is fucking sweet. 

Anyway, that lead in has fuck all to do with what I’m about to share.  It’s just a good fucking story. *This* story is about another good fucking story. One that would have my name on the cover were it not for the *what the fuck* parade that came marching through my life last month. But I’ll expound upon that terrifying shit momentarily. 

It’s actually…a little painful to talk about my story. It’s like one of the those abortions that you pay for out of chivalry but then a year later…you wonder—you know?  My story was about a sheep named Norbert. Ostracized and exiled from the herd because of how loudly he snores, he finds himself alone. And then without his herd—with no sheep to count—he develops insomnia, but later, after some animal-friend-driven personal growth, he learns to count the stars instead. Pretty cute right? I was gonna call it “No Sleep.” It was gonna be something special, something beautiful…

Jesus! Get a load of me blabbering like a pussy. 

Key change. 

**Chapter 1: Have You Herd?**

The fuckery began on a normal Wednesday night in July, wading through viscous subtropical heat, trying to smash. It was thots and shots night at Drip and my buddy Carmine had just struck out with this gorgeous Cuban chick—a Miami 8.5 I’d say.  She was technically in his league, but for some reason, Carmine didn’t like name dropping Little Acorn. Anyway, when we met up again for a conciliatory Patrón at the bar, he told me that the sex wouldn’t have worked. We’re children’s writers, so naturally I figured it was coke dick, but honestly, he didn’t look skiied, he looked…sickly. 

“I can’t focus on fucking,” he said. “It’s against the rules.”

“Wait, what rules, bro?”

He shook his head. “No point in talking about—*shit*—bro, I gotta bounce.”

“What? Why?”

Leaving at 10:30 after one missed miss wasn’t like Carmine. He was a bit of a mirror hog at the gym and the prose in his stories was often uninspired, but the man was a goddamn panther when it came to sweat pens like Drip. 

He glanced over my shoulder, blanched, which I didn’t know was even possible with a spray tan. I turned my head, looking for—I don’t know—Carmine’s bookie? His mother maybe?  *Nothing*—just the writhing chop of a familiar human tide, nothing menacing, nothing out of place. 

“Bro, seriously, what the—“ 

*Fuck*... He was gone, bailed, and I was alone. A Gooseless Maverick treading water in a sea of thirst. It was an uncertain moment, sad in a way, but then I saw an ass that could have been designated a Masterpiece of Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO, and Carmine’s minor betrayal faded. I danced, drank and debauched and only once or twice did I think about the terror in Carmine’s eyes. 

**Chapter 2: Are Ewe Serious?**

Wednesday morning came with a groggy start, a naked girl, and hasty exit. By the time I’d made it into my morning meeting at Little Acorn, I was feeling brand fucking new. 

The recipe for that was simple: 1 Aspirin, 1 Flintstone’s vitamin chewable (I found that Bam Bam typically worked best), 4 oz. Cuban Coffee with sweetened condensed milk, approximately 400 mg cocaine (morning blend), and the extract of the adrenal gland of a certain endangered Amazonian lizard. 

I was ready to pitch No Sleep, ready to get glad handed and high fived, ready to fucking kill it. And then I saw the children. 

Now, Little Acorn might make books for kids, but it is unequivocally not a kid friendly place. We have a mirrored boardroom table for Christ’s sake. There’s typically a prostitute somewhere in the office at any given time sleeping one off. We do a fight club on the roof most Mondays. 

“Hey Julio, what the fuck are these kids doing here?” I asked my boss who was smiling tepidly at a shrimpy ginger tween in a dull green tank top. 

“They’re consultants,” he murmured. 

“Consul—Julio, *they’re kids*. What the hell could they possibly tell us about the books we make?”  The tween was smiling back at Julio, dead mud-colored eyes locked in some bizarre contest of mounting discomfort. “—And where’s Carmine?”

The tween flicked his eyes at me momentarily and Julio let out a quick breath.  When the stare-off resumed, Julio whispered, “who?”

Huh? 

*Who?* Carmine had recommended the guy who did the underlighting on Julio’s Audi. They were Eskimo brothers a dozen times over. *Who?* Seriously?

I was about to force feed Julio a sappy tirade about the brotherhood of men when I felt a tug on my skin tight chinos. The tailoring made it feel uncomfortably intimate. I jumped, reflexively raising a fist for a defensive jab. It was the same ginger tween. Only a bit more female, I guess. A twin?

Her muddy eyes regarded me hollowly, thin lips ajar but not smiling or frowning. “What are your sunglasses?” she croaked. 

What the fuck kind of question was that? God, kids were strange. Now parents—our real consumers—I could work with. No kid really *wants* to read a book, not when they could mainline sticky brain bleach on YouTube. But the parents get to feel like they’re enriching their dopey little monsters with stories like mine. I’m a fucking hero.  What I’m not is an interpreter of nonsensical child syntax. 

I tried my best. “They’re—uh—Persol. It’s a brand. Italian.”

Her expression remained vacant. “If they broke, how many pieces would you pick from your bloody eyes?”

*Nah. Absolutely not.*

“Julio, who are these fucking kids?”

He chuckled joylessly. “They’re helping us to make better stories.”  

Fuck me. It suddenly clicked. Julio was back on tranquilizers. Evening out maybe, but I feared he had overdone it. The boy ginger tween was now pulling at one of his teeth. Still staring, as a dozen other kids of varying sizes stood in a tight sedentary file against one of the walls. I took a seat as far from them as I could manage. The ginger girl loomed behind me, mouth breathing a slow congested rattle. 

I, in contrast, breathed like a man with chemically varnished sinuses, clean metallic air feeding my inner hype beast. The kids were odd. But fuck the kids. I’d pitch my story. They’d love it—everyone would. 

I poured a glass of water, knowing full well that its presence in front of me was purely aesthetic, but it made me feel like a fire that was in want of quenching. One of the kids was picking his nose. He withdrew a bloody finger and proceeded to chew at his fingernail. No emotion. No recognition of his repulsiveness. I narrowed my eyes at him, but he didn’t seem to notice. 

Finally, one of the kids spoke, a lanky girl with hair the color of dental tartar. Her hands stayed buried in the patch pockets of her Depression era frock, arms pale and rigid.  

“My mother named me Maud,” she said. Another weird way to convey what should’ve been a simple introduction. Every one of the other children, boy ginger and blood finger included, twisted their necks to face her. Staring contest; point Julio. Julio gasped for breath like he’d been clam diving in a hot tub and angling to impress a chick. He might have whimpered actually. 

Maud stared as lifelessly as the rest, mouth agape, gulping down Little Acorn’s rarified air like she owned it. 

“Mother died shortly after my birth,” she began flatly. “She tried to eat me in the hospital, but she whetted her appetite with my placenta. It didn’t sit well with her. The doctors wrote that it was the stomach pains that led her to open her throat with a scalpel. Even so, she nursed me for days. Once I’d latched, I wouldn’t stop drinking her. It was a medical miracle...”

Uhhh…no. The ginger twins were off putting, blood finger, revolting, but this kid…Jesus Fucking Christ. All the same, everyone else at the table seemed strangely enraptured, like this kid was about to pull a Malala and sew up hearts and minds with some impassioned message about perseverance. I knew better. Maud wasn’t a firebrand, she was a Children of the Corn extra, creepy and dull, rustic without being charming. 

“Julio,” I whispered. “I don’t know about—“ 

I felt a little hand grip my shoulder. Hard. I turned to see girl ginger tween’s slumping face staring down at me. “You’re going to be a problem, aren’t you?” she whispered. I heard the rustle of a dozen collars. In my peripheral vision, I could see two dozen eyes trained on me. 

“Don’t touch me, little girl,” I snapped. 

I felt something rash brewing. These kids weren’t normal. But the more I thought about wrenching the girl’s arm away or pushing her into the wall—the more I *focused* on the thought—the more Carmine’s words echoed in my mind. *It’s against the rules*…

*What fucking rules*?

Girl ginger turned toward Maud. A dozen impassive faces followed suit in sharp synchronicity. Maud made a flinching attempt at a smile, but settled on a sneer. 

“You’re like mother, aren’t you? Creating just to suck down the afterbirth. But do you sustain your creations after they’re in the world, like mother? Or do you ignore the pain of gluttony and keep eating?”

What the fuck was she talking about?

“Do you have a story to tell?” she asked. “Break your water and let us bathe in your drivel.”  

Julio was crying, openly weeping beside me. I was distracted by ‘drivel.’  Fuck this kid. Fuck all of them. I cleared my throat, tried to think of something cutting that a child would understand and then internalize. I cleared my throat again. And again. Maud was smiling all of the sudden, an unsettling gummy slit across her face that changed nothing about her eyes. I reached for the water, gagged as my fingers—suddenly clammy—fumbled with the glass. There was something caught in my throat, a fibrous tickle. I coughed, retched, reached into my mouth, and dragged a long tuft of wet wool from my throat. What the absolute fuck. 

Janine, who was hot enough to be a pharmaceutical sales rep in somewhere vain like Beverly Hills, but illustrated stories instead, was full on ugly crying. 

Julio contrarily stopped his emotionally unhinged sobbing and said, “Chills, man. Chills.” 

I shrugged away girl ginger’s hand as she began to massage my shoulder. I hadn’t seen boy ginger slink down beneath the table. I didn’t see him crawling across the floor under it. But I felt his fingers tugging at my pant leg. I jumped backwards, but my chair was held firm somehow by his waifish sister. His fingers had made red marks on my white pants and as I looked down at his now smiling face, I saw why. He raised a hand. And dropped a tooth in my lap. 

He tongued a hole in his top row of teeth, blood marbling his smile. And everyone—*everyone*—began to clap. 

**Chapter 3: Shear Lunacy**

Masculine weeping. *It’s against the rules.*

Giving into insanity. *Against the rules.*

Torturing myself over rules. *AGAINST THE RULES!*

I spent the next day drinking furiously as my existence seemed whittled down by a persistent mental chorus of regulatory admonition. I tried to think about my—you know—the sheep in my No Sleep story. I couldn’t remember his name, his characteristics, his struggle. His existence, too, seemed somehow against the rules. But I remembered the title. *No Sleep*…a story about—about—I couldn’t remember. 

I tried messaging Carmine to vent about the kids, about Julio’s bro fail, about my once perfect white Prada chinos that now looked like I’d ignored my menstrual calendar. It was all too fucking much. But Carmine left me on read. His IG was gone. His Twitter. It left a hole in my heart, and as a man, I can admit that because the dude was a goddamn friend. 

Distraught, I decided to look up his books on Amazon. *Who’s Afraid of Virginia’s Wolf*?  *Kaspar, The Friendly Wendigo*.  *What Just Happened*?

They were there, a momentary relief, until I saw the author name. 

Carmine *Rimosso*

His name is Giambini. Who the fuck was Rimosso?

The strangeness was only compounded by what I saw when I actually clicked on the books. Carmine always released with preview pages but they were gone. There was no way to buy the books either. Just a title, an author and a clutch of reviews that felt suddenly hollow without the rest. 

I doubled down on liquor, cut out a long line and found myself holding a silver straw, no longer feeling the party. For the first time in my life as a writer, I put a line back in the bag. It was miserable. The opposite of sending a luxury SUV off the high dive in almost every way. My story was being swallowed by some unknowable force, and my friend—my bro—was gon—

*bzzzzt bzzzzt*

—was *gonna* explain some shit. 

Missed call. New voicemail. Carmine. 

I opened the voicemail, played it, feeling outraged and confounded. Then I listened to a wet crunch and a hope maiming shriek and then another and another. Carmine’s pleas for mercy…a sonorous omen of what was to come. 

**Chapter 4: Bleating To Death**

1 Aspirin, 20 oz. Blood Mary, 1.7g cocaine (rage blend), 2 Bam Bams, 1 Pebbles. 

*Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds!* Oppenheimer, sure, but also Lord Krishna, right? Behold the monstrosity of the divine and know your duty is only to swing the sword, right? Death will come, provisioned by divine will and no man shall have a say in where it lands! To murder a dozen awful children is the great illusion. My dharma is rage. Rampage. Untwinning gingers in a tidal wave of blood soaked fury. I am a writer! I am a little acorn destined for oakhood! I have a pen mightier than the swords of my foes and I’m gonna stab someone in the fucking neck with it!* 

That, of course, was the drugs talking. Internally, I was screaming like Islamorada dawn fish. The drugs rallied though when I saw the message scrawled in possibly blood across the wall opposite the elevator as I entered. 

*OOC IS AGAINST THE RULES.*

What new hell was this? OOC was Obscene Office Chatter, our shorthand for shooting the shit without having to worry about judgment or self-censorship or some new writer clutching their pearls about a graphic description of Julio’s 40th birthday office bacchanal. Sure, OOC wasn’t universally appropriate, but goddamnit, it made us feel good, especially on slow days when we weren’t feeling on top of things. 

“Julio!” I shouted, making a bee line past Donna’s strangely vacant perch at the front desk. “Julio! What the fuck is going on, bro? Because I’ve just about—“ I barged into Julio’s office, bullish, in search of China. But he wasn’t there. 

“Julio?” 

The halls were empty too. Where the hell was everyone?  I marched past a row of editors’ offices, each missing the morning din of keystrokes, sniffles and expletives. 

“Hello?”

Then, I thought I heard a pitter-patter of feet nearby. No adult pitter-patters. I thought of the red proclamation on the entry wall and bristled at the sound. One of the devil children... My coke fueled bravado was failing me and suddenly I felt sweaty and too sober by half. So, I searched an editor’s desk for a bottle of something to take the edge off. 

*Viagra*. Pfff. Classic Todd. Porn…*magazines*? What fucking century—wait—yes! Scotch! 

It was Johnnie Walker Red Label, an inferior choice, but I put my snobbery aside and swilled. The soft burn kindled something bold inside of me. Courage maybe. But then I heard a human voice bleating like a sheep nearby. 

Fuck. 

I brandished the bottle—comfort object, talisman and cudgel, all—and followed the sound. To the board roooo-oh my god, what the fuck!  

The table was overturned against a wall, mirrored top shattered into a grim mosaic across the floor. Several children stood against the opposite wall, all looking in the same direction, despondent as ever. Seated in a circle on the floor were the Little Acorn troops, all of them wearing ill-fitting sheep onesies over their clothes. And Maud sat at the center of it all, languidly cradling a see-and-say in her skinny arms. 

She turned toward me, twisting her neck unnaturally as her body remained motionless. Her lips twitched and every face in the room snapped in my direction. Janine’s neck crackled, her head turned backwards. She was silently weeping—all the Acorns were—stolid smiles plastering their limp faces. 

“Join the meeting,” Maud droned. “You’re a sheep. Sit…and be…herd.”

The hell I would. I was a man! a writer, a goddamn *artist*. I had craft…or something. I was not a fucking sheep. 

Janine’s body slumped backwards to the floor, her face coming to rest on a slice of mirror. I took a step back, adrenaline tightening my legs for flight while my coke addled heart raced in time with a flurry of unhelpful thoughts. Another step back. 

*pitter-patter-pitter-pattter-pitter-patter*

I wheeled around toward the sound approaching from behind. I looked down, startled. Girl ginger tween smiled up at me, matte mud eyes staring indifferently. She was holding a pair of scissors; she snipped them quickly in the air and I watched thin filaments of wet crimson stretch between the blades. Then she cocked her head to one side. And I tried to cock it back with a swing of my bottle of Scotch. 

*She’s a child…* my inner Carmine whispered. *The rules…*

But she wasn’t a child..it was more nuanced than that.. she was a *thing*—a thing that took a hard swing to the head and didn’t so much as flinch. She grabbed my wrist with her empty hand, twisted it with aberrant strength, the bottle thudded to the floor, I shuddered, and she raised the scissors, and snipped. 

I howled, “agh! My fucking ear! What the fuck! What even are you, you creepy little cunt?!”  

Now, I’m not typically one to call children cunts so early in the day, but this kid—*thing*—had earned it. What remained of my ear poured blood down my neck. My favorite Louis Vuitton polo…ruined. A minor tragedy, but one that felt frivolous and so less dire. I tried to focus on that, but felt Maud’s gaze burrowing into the back of my skull. 

*The rules…*

Fuck!  How many fucking rules were there? Where had they come from? My mind reeled as I clutched my mangled head. And from my working ear, I heard Maud’s voice rise above the thump of blood in my temples. 

“Join the meeting. You can don her wool.” Maud gestured to Janine’s body, her perfect, beautiful, Pilates sculped body that always looked so good in business casual body-con.  Maud had taken her away. But as I heard another ear-flicking snip, I did what I was told. I put on the onesie, sat, and shook. 

Maud grabbed the red knob on her see-and-say, pulled it, and I listened to it coo, “The cow says—“

Everyone cut off what I assume would have been a moo, with a chorus of, “BAAAAAH!” It joined with an “AAAH!” at the end. 

Maud turned her gaze to Jean-Phillipe, misunderstood author of Tonton Ma*cuties*, a satirical children's story about death squads and the surrealism of systematic violence. Fresh tears joined his already wet cheeks. 

Maud sighed, “Tell us about your story.”

Jean-Phillipe’s thin smile became a grimace. He opened his mouth and said, “Baaah.  Bah, bahhhh baaaah—baaah baaaaah—baahhh. Buh—b-baah?”

Maud frowned. “Not scary enough.”

*Not scary enough*? Huh? A grown man, weeping beside a corpse, dressed in a children’s costume, bleating for a dispassionate kid-thing while another kid-thing snipped bloody scissors at the only exit to the room, wasn’t scary?  What rose-tinted hell was Maud observing?

I was fucking…*managing*. I swallowed a delusionary lump. 

*The rules…*

My rapid heartbeat and my clammy palms, the sheen of sweat across my face and my rapid breathing, my sand paper tongue and chattering teeth and the tingle in my spine—all clear symptoms of fear…but also cocaine use. Was I afraid?

*The rules…*

What was happening to me? Why was I trying to be brave?  I was maimed for Christ’s sake, trapped in a hellish daycare with freakishly strong demon children! …But acknowledging my fear directly still felt strange. Fuck it. I was terrified. Shrinking internally, throat sliding down the inside of my chest as my limbs felt strangely nauseous independently of my guts.

*Are you afraid…*

Yes! I was scared! Fuck! I had been from the moment Maud told her corpse nursing story. Who wouldn’t have been?!  Cavalier is not the same thing as being aphobic! 

I lost it. Screamed internally. 30% frustration, 70% terror. I was scared. Completely. In fact, I was so invested in my fear that I almost lost track of what was going on around me. 

One of the children grabbed Jean-Phillipe by the arm and dragged him screaming toward the supply closet. “I am, in this moment, terrified!” He screamed. But I knew before he said it. 

The child opened the closet door, pulled Jean-Phillipe inside, and shut it behind them. Jean-Phillipe’s screams yanked at my guts; nauseating, primal sounds that rattled the circle of sheep into fits of sobbing and wide-eyed convulsive terror. I couldn’t move. I wanted to, but my muscles atrophied in response to the vague notion of some unimaginably horrendous happening befalling my friend. 

When the screams finally subsided into a gurgle and then nothing at all, I realized that Janine had been the lucky one. The child emerged from the closet, hung a bloody sheep onesie over a chair and then joined the others along the wall. 

Maud scratched her nose, nodded her head, and pulled the knob. The see-and-say’s chubby arrow spun squeakily. 

“The sheep says BAAAAAAAHH!”

“You,” she said with the softness of a thumbtack. 

“Me?” I answered. “I don’t—I don’t know what I’m supposed to—“

“Tell us your story. The one about sheep.”

I didn’t know it. It was called *No Sleep*.  That’s all the detail I could remember. It had been beautiful though. Really something amazing. Maybe there was some way to remember it. 

“We’re waiting…” she prodded. 

“Why are you doing this? The rules, the closet—what is this all for?”

She didn’t answer. 

“Look, I understand rules. I don’t always follow them, but I’m not a fucking sheep, okay? Sometimes I’m a falcon or a tiger or—you know—a badass unicorn. We all are—everyone who writes for Little Acorn—and that’s a good thing. We challenge each other to push limits and delve into emotionally evocative areas.” 

“I love this…sentiment,” said Julio, wincing ludicrously beneath a mop of shiny white costume curls. “It’s like on my 40th when Todd fucked that hobby horse (classic Todd)—he pushed a limit that night that inspired a story.  A good one.”

“OOC is against the rules…” the children hummed in unison. 

“And more importantly,” Maud added. “No Sleep *is* about sheep.”

Was No Sleep just about sheep? Just the innocuous, inoffensive herd? Or had it once been about something more challenging? Fuck! I couldn’t remember. 

Maud continued, “you piss on the floor and write your name in cursive because you think it’s daring, and then expect everyone to shake your dick afterwards and tell you what a brave thing you did. You’re not the first, not innovative. You’re just another prick adding your shade of yellow to the puddle. Now tell your story.”

Well damn.

I had had a story. Now I didn’t. I had No Sleep. I had sheep. Maud wanted something scary. So I told her a story about a children’s book author and a dozen terrifying consultants and a circle of people *dressed* as sheep. In the end, she just nodded and looked toward the closet. Then she sighed morosely. 

“Are you afraid, sheep?” she asked me. 

“Yes.”

“Good. You should be. Write about it. Write for everyone. Make them all as scared as you. Democratize the terror you weave…because if you don’t…”

Her eyes panned to Jean-Phillipe’s onesie. I felt bile sting my throat. 

“Make them *all* scared?” I asked uneasily. “But they’re just stories, they won’t scare *everyone*…”

Maud drew her lips into what might have been a smile. “You told a story about us. That wasn’t *just a story* for him.” She bobbed her head toward the onesie. “Your stories real, even if they don’t seem that way. And if they aren’t real, sometimes they *become* real. Now go write.” 

I shivered recursively. 

She pulled the knob. The arrow spun. 

“The writer says, FUCK! PLEASE DON’T REMOVE M—“

My girlfriend and I really like horror-related things and we have a lot of respect on this subject. 
But we are curious and since we had nothing to do we were reading posts on #nosleep. 

The post was related to a curse and we were in shock with what we were reading. 
I went to read the comments and barely stopped reading and blocked my phone, we heard some noises. 

At first they were just a lot of seagulls but after this noise it began to play a song like those that play in the carousels. 
But it was played on a piano and the sound came from the street but it was too loud and seemed close to us. 

We live on the 3rd floor and the music seemed to be right across the bedroom window. 
I had already had paranormal experiences but this one happened at 3:00 a.m. 

We went to the balcony and there was no one on the street, the only thing we saw was the neighbor lying asleep and staring at us. 
In the end we heard seagulls again as if they were suffering... 

Then bugs began to appear everywhere and enter our room as if there were something that would call them here. We are still on alert because the neighbor's part seemed suspicious but anyway it was something bizarre that had never happened to us. We never heard the seagulls again as if after suffering they had disappeared. 

I would like to remember who the post was so I could talk to the person but I just forgot and the only thing I remember is that it was about a curse. At the moment we hear cars on the street, people coughing and some strange noises that we are not used to hearing here. 

It's always so peaceful at night that we're amazed and I think that's what makes us feel the most. This is a quiet and very good place to live even because of it. And out of nowhere you hear screams, suffering seagulls, pianos, and the bugs that don't even want to know about us today have all appeared. 

It was something very strange and the best thing is to always go to sleep before reading any post or before 3am. It's probably no sleep for us today. I wonder what this was and if it was just a big coincidence.

We were reading a post by someone on #nosleep and when we finished we started listening to a song that was playing outside.

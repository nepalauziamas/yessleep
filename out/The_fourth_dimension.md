“Faster”, the voice in my head kept screaming. 

My lungs and throat were burning. My legs were begging for me to stop. My brain, knowing of the danger that awaited if I didn’t run,  commanded yet another pump of adrenaline. My heart quickly pumped it to the rest of my body.

The pain in my legs dimmed, allowing me to run faster. I was close now. 

But soon enough, the adrenaline wore off. I had abused my body too much. I collapsed to the ground. My brain was trying to shut down to preserve the last bits of remaining energy in my fatigued body. I was already losing my peripheral vision. 

I used my last bit of energy to lift my arm up enough to look at my watch.

*1:29*

no…

NO! 

This wasn’t the time. My brain managed to salvage up enough to send one last little pump of energy. Enough for me to get up and get to my house. It was only a few meters away from where I collapsed. I put my hand on the knob, and that’s when I heard the dreaded sound.

*click*

It’s a lock. It locks every house in town at exactly 1:30 AM. Theoretically, to lock everyone inside their houses for the early hours of the morning. They only unlock at 3. 


I live in a small town in greece, Of about 670 people. The town is fairly normal, except for  the local government not letting anyone out from 1:30 AM to 3:00 AM.  No one tells us why. It has been like this since pretty much forever. Since way before I was born. Not a single person who was outside between these hours is alive today. The last and only presumed incident was a very long time ago. No one knows if the person survived or not, because we have no record. No one knows if it actually happened.

Anyways, I was about to be the first person to experience it. Not that I wanted to.

I sat there in my driveway recalling how I got in this situation. I lost my sense of time. I was out with friends and I just forgot about my life. When I checked the watch it was already 1:25.

My friends and I rushed out of the park we were hanging out at. The town is very small, but it’s only 3 roads, connected by smaller paths. 3 very long roads, and my house was on the opposite side of town. And the town was small enough that no one owned a car, or a motorcycle, OR a bike. Everything was on foot. 

So that’s how I got here. I reviewed every single unfortunate decision I’ve made to get here dozens of times over. And then, suddenly everything started to light up. And it turned impossibly bright for a fraction of a second.

Then everything was back to normal. Except that there was a bright sphere floating down the road. My curiosity fought against my instinct, and won. I started walking towards it. 

I got near it, and it was too bright to keep my eyes fully open. It wasn’t hot or loud. Just bright.

I decided to touch it. So I did, but I didn’t. Instead of touching it, my hand went through it. And it pulled my arm, which sucked me into it. 

Next thing I knew I was numb. Completely numb, like when you sleep on top of your arm and wake up with it feeling like play doh. My whole body was like that.

I tried and failed to get myself orientated. I couldn’t figure out what was up or down. I was feeling weird. And then I touched the ground. Except it felt off. It wasn’t quite what I was used to. It only made my feet even number than they already were. 

I dared to open my eyes, and I saw everything. I saw my entire town, except it wasn’t an aerial view. I saw everyone’s houses, and inside their houses. I saw the roads, under the roads and all the earth beneath it. I could see everything and everyone everywhere. I couldn’t quite understand from where though. I just knew that I wasn’t in the 3rd dimension anymore.

I had been reading about the fourth dimension for months now. No, it’s not time. Time isn’t a dimension. I can’t explain the fourth dimension. [This guy I found after I got back](https://youtu.be/w7peRwdBpu4) can. 

I was too scared to look away from my dimension. I really didn’t want to. But I did anyways. And I cannot describe what I saw. There literally aren’t any words in the English language that could. 

But it was an environment. There were things moving. I don’t know if they were beings. And the colours too, they just weren’t. I’ve never seen them before. They were probably out of the colour spectrum of our dimension. There aren’t words that can describe them either. 

And something came tumbling towards me on the “ground”. I immediately identified it as a tesseract. The “beings” were the ones who tossed it to me. Seeing an actual 4D shape, in 4D was mindblowing. I can’t describe the shape either. The best you can find on the internet is the shadow of a tesseract, or the rotating shadow. You can’t physically display a 4D object on a 2D screen. But I could see it right here, and once again, there aren’t any words in the English language to describe the shape. I’ll try my best. 

So you know how every side of a square (2D) is a line (1D)? And every side of a cube (3D) is a square (2D)?

So, every side of the tesseract (4D) was a cube. 

Trippy, right? This is the best explanation I could come up with. 

I stayed up there for what felt like ages. The “beings” were trying to communicate with me, I think. But nothing came out of it. Eventually they I think pushed? me back to the sphere. I tried to resist, but they were one dimension higher than I was and possessed impossible amounts of force. I just spent my last few seconds in the dimension trying to comprehend it.

I couldn’t. 

I woke back up in my driveway. I checked my watch and heard the click. 3:00 AM. 

I haven’t slept yet. I’ve been typing this out and pondering what tf did I experience. It’s been several hours since then.

I thought about the phrase I kept hearing over and over again. I heard one single garbled mess of syllables the entire time I was there.

It sounded something like “Fou no las fa komi”

Fou no las fa komi. 
Fou no las fa komi.
Fou no las fa komi. 
Fou no las fa komi.

Four? Four no las fa komi?


Wait a minute.

Four not last, five coming? 

Maybe the fourth dimension isn’t the last one. There is a fifth. And theoretically a sixth, a seventh, an eighth and so on.

But what do they mean with the fifth is coming?

Now that I think about it, [I do recall a very distressed tone.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/)

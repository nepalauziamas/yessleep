The other night after locking that thing in the suitcase, I shoved it under the bed in the spare room, which is next to mine, and went to bed, but I couldn’t sleep. I was afraid it would break out and I’d wake up with it eating my face or something like that, so I must have got up 100 times to make sure it was it still locked up. Every time before I checked on it, I put on about five layers of clothes and a hockey mask for protection before going into the room, but nothing happened. It must have been at least 3am when I fell asleep, at 3.45 I heard loud banging coming from the spare room, I was terrified. I jumped out of bed as fast as I could, then spent another 10 minutes putting on all my clothes. I grabbed my baseball bat, walked to my bedroom door, took a deep breath, then locked it and started to pray. I'm not usually scared of things like that, but it was still dark out, I was tired, and I probably overthought it, I am a lot braver in the daytime. After about an hour it stopped, and sometime after that I fell asleep with my back up against the door.  

I woke up drenched in sweat and checked the time it was 10 o clock, I was late for work, but I thought, “fuck it, I have bigger problems right now” and rang my boss; I told him I had covid, that would give me enough time to find Rick and sort this shit out. I couldn't even eat breakfast; my stomach was in bits with all the stress, and I was in a really bad mood. I used my anger to psych myself up enough to check on that thing, I got some chicken out of the freezer, grabbed my bat, ran up the stairs and opened the door. The bed was pushed into the corner of the room, the suitcase was wide open in the middle of the floor and the creature was gone. I thought it had escaped, I will admit, I was a little relieved, I thought at least I didn’t have to worry about it anymore, but then I saw it in the corner behind the bed. It looked different, it became dark green, lumpy and was stuck to the wall, it reminded me of a caterpillar chrysalis. 

I had no idea what was inside of it, but I was not going to wait around to find out. I thought to myself, "if I don’t find Rick soon, I am going to call an exterminator or something, I don’t care what Rick said.” Then I remembered there was only one person I had ever seen him talking to, Tom Hogan. I never actually met Tom, but I knew where to find him. He owned a lot of properties in town, but he spent most of his time hanging around a used car lot, I'm not sure why he liked that place so much, maybe it was because it was his first business. I didn’t waste any time, I got in my car and within minutes I was there, I could see him through his office window from my car. Without thinking I walked straight in the door walked up to the reception desk and demanded to see, Mr. Tom Hogan. The girl looked surprised, I thought she was going to send me away but then she asked my name, which I stupidly gave. Then she told me to take a seat as she picked up the phone, a few minutes later, she said he will be with you shortly. 

As I sat there patiently waiting, I realized I had no idea what to say to him, I thought, “should I tell him everything, he is Rick's only friend, besides, I have no idea what that thing is or what I am supposed to do with it.” By the time Tom came out of his office, I decided that I was going to tell him what happened and hoped he would take the creature off my hands. Before he reached me, I stood up and said, “Have you seen Rick” fairly loud. He gave me a nervous smile, giggled, and looked around as if to see had anyone else heard. 

Then he asked me to follow him to his office. When I got there, he told me to sit down and make myself comfortable as he closed the door behind me. “Who Exactly are we talking about, Rick?” he asked, pacing over and back behind his desk staring down at the floor. 

I did not want to be rude and say roadkill Rick, they were friends, so I just said, “the guy with the rusty pickup truck, have you seen him?”  

He stopped in his tracks and turned towards me, stared straight into my eyes and said, “who are you? and how do you know Rick?” He started to freak me out, he looked like he wanted to hit me, I knew then I could not say anything to him about Rick or the creature, so I lied. 

I made up this story about our cat getting knocked down and told him that Rick had taken him, I said I just wanted him back, so I could bury him. I don’t think he believed me, he looked disappointed by my answer. I got up and made my way to the door, while he asked, "Can I get your name and address? I'd like to know where to send the remains of your cat, if I find him that is” 

I mumbled quietly so he couldn’t hear me as I left his office, at the main entrance I looked back he was on the phone. When I got to the car, I could see him talking to a large man with a ponytail, he looked rough and very out of place, they were both staring at me. I panicked and took off so fast I could hear the tires screech. I had planned to go to Ricks house in hopes of finding answers, but I was afraid, Tom Hogan would find me there. So, I decided to get some timber and supplies and build some sort of cage, I thought, if I had to keep that thing at home, I needed to feel safe. So, when I got home, I started work straight away, the creature was already in the corner of the room stuck to the walls, so I decided to build around it to save time. I did not want to spend too much time in there with it, so I done most of the work downstairs. It was a very simple plan; I made a three-inch frame, which I bolted to the floor and walls, then I screwed on two-inch hardwood planks. For the lid I got the strongest hinge I could find and an array of bolts and locks. I am no carpenter, but I was very happy with the results.  

By the time I had finished I was exhausted, so I got something to eat and went to bed. When I woke up this morning, I felt refreshed, I had heard no noise coming from that thing all night. The first thing I did was go into the room to check on it, I got my flashlight and looked in through the air holes I made, it had gotten slightly bigger, but besides that there was no real change. I felt a bit more relaxed at home knowing that creature was locked up tight, so I thought I’d have a shower and do a few things around the house. 

After what happened with tom Hogan the day before I was in no rush to go to Ricks house anyway. When I finished, I just sat on the couch and watched tv for a while. It was evening when I decided to leave the house, I planned on driving past Ricks house first to make sure it was safe. Then Park down the road and sneak in through a field without being seen, I did not get past my front porch because the guy with the ponytail that had been talking to Tom Hogan was parked across the road. I don’t think he saw me because I ran back into the house straight away, I watched him out the window for a while, I think he was waiting for me to come out. After about an hour the cops passed and must have frightened him off because he left, I was so relieved but that didn’t last long. 

A short time later I began to hear scratching coming from the spare room, by the time I went upstairs it had stopped, as evening turned into night, the scratching returned and became more and more frequent. I knew it would be only a matter of time before it hatched so I tried to prepare myself as best I could, which I suppose means nothing since I had no idea what I was dealing with in the first place. To make it worse that dickhead with the ponytail came back, this time I could see him wandering around my garden. I was sure he was going to break in, until I heard the neighbor that lives across the road ask him what he was doing. I have no clue what he said, but he left soon after.  

Now he is back, I can see him parked down the street in a different car, I don’t know what I am more scared of, that creature or that ponytail fuck. All I know is I am going to stay up all night holding this baseball bat, and the first thing that comes near me is getting knocked the fuck out.

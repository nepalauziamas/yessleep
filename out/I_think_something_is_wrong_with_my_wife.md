She’s been acting so weird lately. My name is Mark and me and my wife share the age of 26, but she’s been so weird for the past few days.

It all started a couple days ago, when I told her I was going out to eat with some friends in the afternoon.

She just, stared at me with rage.
It was like it wasn’t even her, I could see the burn in her eyes but that didn’t stop her from staring into my soul. And then she just walked out, confused, I asked her.

“What’s wrong, babe?”

I got no answer so I walked out.

After the night out with the guys, I was driving back home until I saw a lady. She had grey linen on with black hair. 

She just started sprinting towards me.

Like any person would do, I hopped in my car and drove off.

At the house, I asked my girlfriend what happened.

“Sorry babe, I don’t know what got into me.”

“It’s okay my love, let’s move past this and go to bed.”

We woke up to the sound of soft sprinting footsteps in the kitchen, like any man would do, I got my shank and protected my wife.

It was the lady again, but this time she resembled someone I knew, I don’t know who it was but they seemed so familiar.

She swung, I dodged and grazed her cheek with the shank. She knew I was much more capable and ran out of the house.

I looked back at my wife and there she was, sound asleep.

But wait, I just remembered.

I don’t have a wife, or a house.

So, who’s in my house?

I turned around to see the faint view of my wife, as she ran towards me.

As she tried to stab me with a needle of some sort, I started dodging, fearing for my life.

“WHO ARE YOU?”

“WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?”

I asked her these questions, to no avail I got no answer. I was getting tired of dodging so I decided to put and end to this. With one swift motion i weaved once again and hit her with a quick right to the stomach, where she dropped to the floor.

“Mark, don’t do this, please, I’m just trying to help you.”

“You don’t know me, I don’t know you, why should I spare you?”

“Mark please, just take it, it will help you.”

“NO, you don’t know who I am!”

And with one swift motion I grabbed a shank and ended her life.

Wait, I remembered another thing.

I don’t have a house, or friends.

I came into consciousness and saw my caretaker, lying on the floor, dead.

I realized something, that lady WAS the caretaker, the needle she was trying to stab me with was my medicine.

I realized that day, you should always ask who someone is if you think they’re familiar, because you never know if you’re living in your own consciousness.

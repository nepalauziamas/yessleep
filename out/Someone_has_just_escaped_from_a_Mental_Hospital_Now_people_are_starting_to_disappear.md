It was just an ordinary day for me and my friend, we were both on my couch. I was on my phone, Ryan was on his phone. we had put on the TV for background noise, just to accompany us while we were waiting for our food. 

That’s when something caught my attention, when it was announced on the TV that 10 people had gone missing yesterday without a trace. Apparently the police had made a statement saying it’s possibly being linked, to a person that had just escaped from a mental hospital. 

“How on earth can 10 people go missing in one day, thanks to one person?” I murmured 

“I mean, they did say a person escaped from a mental hospital and you know, those types of people are capable of doing anything” Ryan replied 

“Eh, true. Let’s just hope that this person manages to not get that far” I said in response 

That’s when we heard a knock on the door. 

“I’ll get it” Ryan said while rushing to the door 

I kept on scrolling through Instagram, while Ryan was paying for the food. 

After 1 minute, he came back into the living room, with our food. “Here you go and here’s your drink”

“Thanks. Hey do you think that 10 people going missing is a bit strange?” I asked Ryan 

Ryan paused for a moment, thinking.

“Yeah, especially in one day. You’re not gonna take the opportunity to investigate the whole disappearances yourself? I mean I know how obsessed you’ve been watching crime shows lately..” Ryan replied 

“No, trust me I’m not gonna do that” I said, laughing at Ryan’s response.

That’s when we heard a phone ringing. 

“Oh it’s my phone, hold on” Ryan told me 

“Hello?” Ryan answering the phone 

“Wait, hold on. Who’s in the house? Okay calm down, just hide in your room and barricade the door. I’ll be there” Ryan said, with a worried voice

“Everything alright?” I asked 

“No, my girlfriend told me someone has just broken into the house” Ryan replied 

“Has she called the police?” I asked, with a worried look on my face 

“Yeah, she has. Listen, we’ll hang out another time, I’ll call you if I get any updates” Ryan told me, while running to my front door

After that, I was left wondering. Was it the same person who had just escaped from that hospital? But I just didn’t care, I just hoped that my friend and his girlfriend would be alright and safe.

After about 2 hours from hearing no updates from Ryan, I decided to call him myself 

“Hello?” Ryan said, while he answered my call 

“Yeah, dude. What happened? Is everything okay??”

“No it’s not, apparently the person who had broke into the house found her, and beat her into a coma. I’m not even sure if she’ll pull through.” Ryan told me, with a depressing voice.

“Shit man, I’ll pray for her and you. You don’t think it’s that person who’d just escaped?” I asked in curiosity 

“Well, actually. The police have just confirmed, it isn’t the person who’s escaped. A lot of evidence proves that guy isn’t responsible for the disappearance and my girlfriend’s coma.” Ryan responded 

“Uhm, what the hell?. That’s weird.” I said in a confusing tone 

“I know, I’m very confused as well. Look, I gotta go. her parents are here, I’ll call you later” Ryan said while hanging up 

I was left wondering, who had beaten Ryan’s girlfriend into a coma? Who was responsible for those 10 disappearances? 

I was left confused, but decided to forget about it. Tommorow I’d visit Ryan at the hospital, but before I went to sleep. I decided to look up on the internet more about the case. Apparently, the person who’d escaped from the hospital was rambling saying “It’s not human, it’s not human, it’s not human. Its going to kill us all” before being sent away in a police car.

That video was blowing up all over social media, people had so many theories on what he was talking about. I just decided to dismiss it as the illness talking and went to take out the trash, as I opened my door to walk to the bin near my front yard, something caught my attention. 

I looked and saw a really tall figure being illuminated by the street light, staring at me with glowing eyes and torn clothes.

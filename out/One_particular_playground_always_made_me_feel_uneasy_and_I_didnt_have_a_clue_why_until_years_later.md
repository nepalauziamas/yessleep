I grew up in a New England county with a nearly excessive amount of playgrounds a kid could play at. I say nearly, because some were… quite unpopular, to say the least, evening the numbers out. One of those playgrounds in particular is where this story begins.

This playground wasn’t unpopular because it would give you splinters, nor was it located in a bad area. It was actually a pretty cool playground, and pretty safe compared to some others. I reckon its unpopularity is due to being on town public school property(belonging to the town right next door to mine). I mean, I wouldn't play on my schools playground - even after school hours. And because this story is on school property, I will not be naming the school for obvious reasons. 

My dad would take my younger siblings and I there if we’d happened to be in the area. After the school had gotten out, of course. But for as long as I can remember going to this playground, I remember having always felt a vague, growing sense of dread.

I never felt this way at any other playground. Just this one. This became all the more clear to me each time we went there to play. I never brought this up, however, because my siblings always seemed to be having a good time and so did any other kids that may or may not have been present during any given one of our visits. And I was the kind of kid who’d try to match everyone else’s energy level. 

But being that was astonishingly impossible to do here, all because of that unsettling feeling. I’d find myself instinctively turning around every couple of minutes to check the surrounding tree line. I’d always seeing nothing, but that feeling of something being there would never go away. 

Then one day in the fall, my dad took us kids again. The days had grown shorter now, and my inner-awareness of something more sinister at play was peaking. So when I’d turned to check my surroundings for the umpteenth time - but this time saw the setting sun disappearing behind the pines, my good spirits went down with it. WAY down.

That weird feeling suddenly felt *here.*

I ran up to my dad and begged him to go. I was genuinely fearful(for whatever inexplicable reason), and I’m sure it showed because my dads demeanor changed. “Why?” he’d asked. I came clean and said something along the lines of: “I don’t like it here, I have a really bad feeling.” I don’t know why, but that had felt embarrassing to admit. 

My siblings wanted to stay a little longer, so my dad gave me the keys to the car. My dad stood not more than 20 feet from the car, watching my siblings like a hawk. I listened to the radio for the next five minutes, which were uneventful. Then it was time to go. 

I didn’t go back to that playground again for almost 15 years, give or take, not knowing nor wanting to know what that sinister feeling was all about.

15 or so years later I was out with a friend, who I’ll call Smith, getting wings at a local joint in the playground town. At this point in my life(early 20’s), I’d developed a darker curiosity for the supernatural and creepy. Smith was curious just the same - and so our outings together usually consisted of exploring abandoned houses and haunted locations(being in New England, there’s plenty). We never got to experience any supernatural scares, though, at least not together. We tried to think of what the nights activities could consist of, but at this point we’d explored just about all there is to offer within a reasonable driving distance.

As we got back into the car, I randomly remembered the playground.

I very enthusiastically suggested we check it out, and Smith was down. I put the school in the GPS - and we were there within five minutes. When my headlights illuminated the playground, all the memories came flooding back. That familiar dreadful feeling had arrived just the same. It looked exactly the same as it did all those years ago.

The parking lot was empty and devoid of street lights. Every window in the school implied there was not a single light on in the building. The sun was just shy of setting for the night, but the sheer amount of tall pines surrounding this place made it so that nighttime arrives 30 minutes ahead of schedule. Except for my Camry’s dim headlights, this place was DARK. “Dude… whoa,” said Smith. He was staring at the woods beyond the basketball court with a heavy look in his eyes. “What?” I asked. He shook his head disapprovingly. “Something isn’t right,” he said. I adhered. We agree on staying in the car for a minute with our windows down, engine and headlights off.

A minute passed by uneventfully, and the next. Smith eventually says something very out of character for him. “I don’t know about exploring this place, man. Honestly, it’s mostly because it’s on school property, but also… I’m feel that feeling you were telling me about, and I really don’t like it.”

I took one last glance at the tree line beyond the basketball court, and agreed with Smith. As we were driving away, satisfied enough with the creepy feeling alone, Smith blurted out: “Maybe this is a native burial ground.”

We did some research on the towns archives(believe it or not, we love to hang out at the library) and my friends claim was *half* valid. It was a burial ground, but for those who had contracted the Spanish flu almost a hundred years ago. A lot of them had been sailors, I'd read.

I recently asked my dad if he knew anything about that playground though, but he did not. But, he did say that something had always felt a little off about the place. Much like me, though, he never brought it up because nobody seemed to complain. And he “especially” didn’t bring it up when I finally *did* complain, as to not freak me out more.

All things considered, I get the hint that those who rest in the woods beyond the basketball court - or perhaps buried right beneath where so many children play - want to be left undisturbed. I can wholly respect whomever or whatever doesn’t want us there, and Smith and I have no intentions of ever returning. If the spirits have to deal with the towns kids jumping and screaming about during the daytime, then the least anyone can do is let them have some peace when the students all go home.

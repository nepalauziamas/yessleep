**TW: sexual assault**

In a reverse of our customary positions, I sat on the therapist’s chair, Grandpa on the patient’s couch. He held the framed picture of himself and Woodley and stared at it, wistfully.

“I had always admired Dr. Woodley,” Grandpa said. “Considered him a mentor. So it was hard for me to realize it when he went completely crazy. He was conducting experiments on patients. In secret.”

“What kind of experiments?” It was an odd dynamic shift. Grandpa knew he’d been less than honest with me, and was acting a little like a chastened child. Meanwhile, I was stern. 

Grandpa continued, reluctantly. “Anson was convinced that this area possessed certain metaphysical properties which allowed the dead to return as ghosts. Wait, it gets crazier. You know what bio-electricity is?”

“Not really.”

“Well, suffice it to say that every human body has an electric charge. For some reason, Anson believed that the amount of bio-electricity in the body at time of death was linked to how . . . what was the word he used . . . ‘corporeal.’ How corporeal that person's ghost would be.”

“I don't get it,” I said, truthfully.

Bruno sighed. He continued, with the vaguely embarrassed tone you now see newscasters use when explaining common conspiracy theories.  “You die with a low bio-electric signature -- very faint ghost. You die with a high one -- solid ghost. Like a real person, almost. That's what he thought.”

“That's crazy.”

“That's what I am telling you. But the poor old fool, he believed it. He thought he had unlocked the secret to eternal life. He became obsessed with creating a completely solid ghost. Now Lacey, our bio-electricity rises in response to fear and pain. Do you see where this is going?”

I’d seen where it was going for a while now. I thought of all the apparitions I’d seen, and how almost all of them were wounded or disfigured. I didn’t want to contemplate it, but the word escaped my lips anyway, in a whisper. “Torture.”

Grandpa nodded. “He used the patients. Made them look like suicides. When I found out, he became enraged. He tried to kill me. I was forced to kill him in self-defense.” Grandpa choked up. “He had been like a father to me.”

For the first time in my life, I felt real anger towards my Grandfather. “Why didn't you tell me any of this?” I asked, working hard to keep my tone even.

His answer sounded only half-apologetic. “Because I thought it would give credence to your hallucinations.”

That was it. I snapped. I leapt up from my chair and got in his face. “Credence? I've been seeing ghosts of crazy people, bleeding crazy people, and now you're telling me some guy was torturing crazy people in this very house, trying to make ghosts! Yeah, I would say that qualifies as fucking credence!”

Grandpa was taken aback. He’d never witnessed me raising my voice. “Lacey. Lacey. Calm down. It's a coincidence.”

Have the words “Calm down” ever helped any situation? I thought as a professional psychiatrist, he should’ve known better. “No!” I insisted. “This is not a coincidence! This is, uh, paranormal phenomenon and I want out of this house. Now.”

“That's not going to happen. You're very sick.”

“I'm not sick!”

“Lacey. I have been living in this house for almost forty years, I have never seen a single ghost. How do you explain that? Huh?”

I wasn’t in the mood for reasoned debate. “I don't know, maybe only certain people can see them.”

Grandpa raised an eyebrow. “Not according to Dr. Woodley's theory. Which, I will remind you, you just told me was crazy not a cat's whisker ago.”

I wasn’t in the mood for lost-in-translation foreign expressions either. “It's too much of a coincidence,” I replied, stubbornly.

“Is it? Your father knew this story. Do you think he might have told you, long ago, when you were little, that he worked in a haunted house? A ghost story a father tells his daughter?”

“He never told me anything like that,” I said, with less than full certainty.

“Do you think maybe your memory buried it, and then brought it up again to feed this delusion?”

Confound that old kraut! Every time I thought I was a hundred percent sure the ghosts were real, he seeded doubt in my mind again. “I don't remember him ever telling me anything like that,” I hedged.

Grandpa just looked at me, sympathetically. 

I sat down on the chair again, holding my head in my hands. “I don't know anything anymore. What's real and what's not. What's wrong with me?”

“I intend to find out, Lacey,” he said, earnestly. “I intend to find out.” Then he seemed to remember something. “Oh. Amongst all the bad news, there is some good news.” He produced an envelope from his pocket and handed it to me. “This arrived today.”

I took the letter, a feeling of warmth spreading through my body. “Mom!”

“I thought that would make you happy,” Grandpa beamed.

“I'm going upstairs to read this,” I said. Reading one of my mother’s letters was an event, a moment to be savored. But I didn’t want to let Grandpa off the hook. “We'll talk about this later,” I said, sounding like a parent again.

Grandpa’s eyes twinkled in amusement at my sudden change in tone. “Yes, we will.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I’m looking at the letter now. It’s hard to believe anything could have taken my mind off the fact that, potentially, there were malicious ghosts in that house. But feeling the paper in my hand – premium stationery from the Savoy Hotel in London – and looking at the beautiful, cursive handwriting, I remember the power those letters had over me. Nothing trumped my desire for a connection with my mother.

I lay on my back on my bed, legs propped up high against the wall, reading the letter and grinning with delight.

Here’s what it said:

*Dear Lacey,*

*So glad to hear you'll be staying with dad. He's a crazy old kraut, but he really knows how the human mind works. I'm confident he'll be able to help you. I can't imagine not being able to go outside. Have you ever seen Paris in the summertime? No, I suppose you haven't. I hope one day you will. Anyway, I'm off to Milan to catch a very buzzed-about show by Gaultier. My life is a hectic one, my dear, but I'm glad it leaves me time to write the occasional word to someone who's so precious to me.* 

*With love and affection,* 

*Mom*

I remember reading that letter over and over, holding it against my chest, closing my eyes in bliss. Then reaching for my tape recorder, and pressing "record." Here is that recording:

*July sixth. Just got a letter from Mom. They always make me forget how bad things are. And right now, they're pretty bad. Like, get this: either I'm stuck in a haunted house or I'm completely crazy. Neither of these scenarios is particularly appealing . . . There's one thing you don't want to think about, isn't there, Lacey? The thing you couldn't tell Grandpa. You saw the man in that photograph. Jacob Walters. . . . But was it really the same man? It was dark. You were running from him. You only got a quick glimpse. Maybe your mind's playing tricks on you. Your mind's a little bitch. It's never been your friend. Don't let it get the better of you, Lacey. Don't let it win.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

That night, after changing into my pajamas, I turned on the monitor for my surveillance system and bolted the door shut. Then I went over and sat on the bed.

*No.* I thought to myself. *No, you don't need this. There are no ghosts.*

I got up and turned off the monitor. 

*And you don't need to lock the door either. There's nothing here that can hurt you.* 

I unbolted the door, and left it wide open, a decision that will haunt me forever. But such was my mindset at the time: denial was my new strategy.

I slipped under the covers and turned off my bedside light. Moonlight spilled through my window, giving everything an eerie glow. I rested for a while, watching the doorway.

Soon enough, two people walked into the room. One was a young man. He held the hand of another, shorter man who was hunched over, concealing his face with his arms and making guttural noises. 

“The doctor did things to my brother,” the young man said, in a solemn, choir-boy kind of way. “Horrible things. Do you want to see his face?”

*That would be a giant “No,”* I thought.

The young man tried to force his brother to reveal his face. The brother shrieked and resisted.

I shut my eyes tight. “They're not real,” I intoned. “They're all in my head. When I open my eyes, they will be gone.”

I opened my eyes. The young man and his brother were indeed gone, but the peace was short-lived. Soon after, a portly nude woman walked into the room and started singing what sounded like some kind of Celtic melody. In another context, it might have been lovely, but in this one it was profoundly unsettling. Especially after the woman’s body faded away, but her song continued.

A rabbit bounded into the room. Not that I fancied myself a particular expert at distinguishing one rabbit from another, but it sure looked like the one we’d just had for dinner. It sniffed around for a bit, then bounded out again.

 A naked man I immediately recognized from the photo and film as Dr. Anson Woodley walked into the room. “I hope you've been enjoying the fruits of my labor,” he said. “They thought I was crazy. They cut off my funding. If only they could see me now. If only they could touch me.” He smiles sadly. “There are still things you don't know, my dear. There are still secrets.”

They were talking to me now?! Well, that was an unwelcome development. 

Woodley faded away. I was no longer bothering to close my eyes. I was just watching this bizarre freak show unfold.

A naked woman walked into the room. Her face was familiar as well, although bruised and bloodied: it was Sarah Bennings, the woman from the Patient Profiles binder who’d been labeled as a child killer.

“I guess I can understand how someone might think I was fit for the loony bin,” she said. “I mean, how could a woman who killed her own child -- her own flesh and blood -- how could she not be crazy? But they didn't see what I saw when I looked into his eyes. The devil was inside of him. And if he had been allowed to live, to grow into a man, the things he would have done . . . I saved the world! By killing my child, I saved the world! You believe me. Don't you?”

Sarah looked so pitiful, so desperate to be validated, that I almost told her I believed her. But I didn’t have a chance. Without warning, she leapt onto me and started clawing at my face with her fingernails.

“Tell me you believe me! Tell me you believe me!” she screamed, over and over.

I screamed right back, and tried to grapple with her, but I soon realized that my assailant was weightless, her attempts to injure me totally impotent.

I remembered Suzie’s words about her brother’s experience with a spirit: *It passed right through him like it was made of smoke.*

Sarah eventually disappeared. I lay there for a bit, catching my breath, dreading what act was to come next in this hellish circus. The ghost I wanted to see the least was the berserker, Jacob Walters. The one who was a close second walked into the room: Mark Sheldon, the man I’d seen one time earlier. The man Dr. Woodley had described with the terms “serial rapist” and “messiah complex.”

Sheldon smiled at me. My heart sank.

“Don't mean to sound conceited,” he said, “but I'm not bad to look at, all things considered. Am I? I daresay, were we meeting under different circumstances, it might be lust making your heart go all pitter-pat, as opposed to mortal fear.”

He got close to the bed, leaning right into me. I recoiled.

“Careful now, though, don't dismiss me as a pretty face,” Walters whispered. “For at the risk of further conceit, my mind is as flawless as my features. Few among us are so doubly blessed, although in fairness, I do have genetics on my side. I'm the son of God.”

He grinned and stood up again, pacing the room.

“Yes, verily, he equipped me well to carry out His mission. What mission, you ask? Why to plant my seed in every womb, until such day as the human race -- all of us -- are truly His children. At first I played elegant games of seduction. 'Cause I can be charming, I can be debonair. If the impulse strikes. But I'm also impatient by nature, I'm afraid. I began dispensing with the preamble. The law called it rape. And so I was sent away to rot with lunatics and madmen and villains most foul. But fear not, our story has a happy ending. They couldn't kill Jesus, and they couldn't kill me.”

He stopped pacing and stared at me hungrily.

“'Cause here I am. And there you are. And I think it's time I stopped talking.”

“You can't hurt me,” I whispered.

“What?” he demanded.

“You can't hurt me,” I said, a little bolder. “You're not real. You're in my head.”

“Am I?”

“And even if you were real,” I continued, defiantly, “you couldn't touch me. 'Cause you're a ghost. You'd just pass right through me.”

Unexpectedly, Sheldon started to giggle. Then he walked over to my desk, and did something that made my stomach churn. He picked up my apple, uneaten from lunch, and took a big bite. Then he walked over to me and spit chewed-up apple all over my face.

Clearly, he wasn’t like the others. He was corporeal. He could hurt me.

I screamed and tried to clamber off the bed to run past him. But he stuck out an arm like a clothesline to my neck. I fell to the floor.

“Pass right through you, huh?” He delivered a brutal, barefoot kick to my stomach, knocking the wind out of me. “Is that passing right through you?”

I clutched my stomach, coughed, and gasped for breath. Sheldon pulled me roughly to my feet and pinned me against the wall.

“It's not without a hint of romance, is it? Back from the dead he comes, a dashing stranger, to pluck the virtue of a trembling little foal.”

I started to cry. “No. No, please. I'll do anything you want. Just please, don't do that to me. Don't do that to me. Please”

He stroked my hair, revoltingly. “Why is it that a girl is never more beautiful than when she's afraid?”

I wish I could tell you that I escaped him. I did everything I could to try and break free, but he was incredibly strong.

He put his disgusting mouth to my ear and whispered, “Close your eyes now, and think of precious things. It will all be over before you know it.”

Every Wednesday, my parents will leave the house to go on a date, and I'll be home alone during that time. I'm an only child, so they only need to worry about me and not another kid. Sometimes it gets lonely, but eh. It makes things peaceful when it needs to be.

When I was younger, they'd get a babysitter but I'm old enough now to where they can trust that I won't run off or burn the house down or anything like that. And this has been normal and fine until recently.

See, recently there's been something. I guess strange would be the most applicable word- Something strange has been happening.

So, every Wednesday, they'll leave around 5 PM, give or take a few minutes. They're pretty punctual about it, which I appreciate. So, every evening around 5, they'll say their goodbyes to me and leave. However, these last few weeks, there's been a knocking at the door.

The first time it happened, it was exactly 6:45. I assumed that maybe it was a neighbor coming for something, or my parents just got home early, or even a delivery of sorts. However, when I opened the door, no one was there. A little odd, but probably just some neighborhood kids trying to confuse me.

Two weeks later, it happened again. At exactly 6:45, there was a firm three knocks on the front door, but there was no one there when I checked. Again, kind of weird, but whatever.

Since that second time, it's been happening every. Single. Week. Every Wednesday, at 6:45 on the dot, I'll hear three firm knocks on the front door, but no one is there. I haven't brought it up to my parents because, well it's probably not a big deal.

Or, well, it could be. See, the reason I'm coming here to post about this isn't because, oh I'm freaked out over this thing that happens every week but is ultimately harmless. No, this last time was a little bit different and I'm starting to get properly spooked.

So, last week. Wednesday, August 17th. My parents are out on a date, as they do. I'm in the living room, watching Bones. 6:45 is growing closer, so I have the volume a little low, my attention split between listening for the knocking and what's happening in the episode.

6:45 rolls around, and... Nothing. No knocking. No noise. Just the sound of my own heartbeat and the show on the TV.

I waited for about 5 more minutes, thinking that maybe whoever kept bugging me was just a bit late. Nothing.

This has been happening for several months, and now it just stops? Either the kid messing with me or *whatever* is going on got bored, or I've just been hearing things this whole time. It irked me out so bad that I just had to check.

I opened the front door and looked around. The sky was a little grey as the sun was approaching the end of its day cycle, but the whole area around was still lit. No one was nearby.

However, upon looking down at the mat, I saw a small envelope. No return address, just "Elijah", which is my name. This was hand delivered and definitely wasn't there when my parents left, which didn't exactly fill me with reassurance.

The handwriting was so *neat,* at first I thought it was typed, but upon further inspection, I can tell it was definitely written on with a Sharpie or something.

I knew my parents would be returning in only a little over an hour, so I quickly went upstairs and put the envelope under my pillow so I could open it later that night when I wasn't alone in the house. That's a bit random, but I just felt unsafe, y'know?

I headed back downstairs, made sure the front door was locked, and went back to watch Bones and get my mind off of it. Thankfully for my own peace of mind, nothing else happened that night. My parents came back at around 8, and I was able to go back upstairs without feeling too uneasy.

I wish I could tell you I opened the letter right then. That I spent the whole night reading over whatever it said and coming to some conclusion, but the truth? I was too afraid.

I only opened it yesterday.

For the visually impaired or anyone who can't read that for whatever reason, it's handwritten on lined paper that's ripped around the edges. Here is what it says :

&#x200B;

**Elijah \[My Middle + Last Names\]**  
You have been so lonely recently. So. Very. Lonely.  
Do you enjoy my visits?  
If you find this letter before your parents do, I'll assume  
the answer is yes.  
You should let me in some time.

I'd love to visit.

&#x200B;

I'm officially freaked out now. Who is this person? How do they know my full name? Why is their handwriting so font-like? What is their fixation with me? Why do they always show up at the same time but never stick around, especially if they want to visit like they claim???

I'm terrified. I haven't told my parents about this because I'm not sure if they'd take it seriously or not. After all, this all could just be an elaborate prank. Besides, it's not like this person's tried to properly break in or anything.

My parents are gonna be going on a date again in only a few days and I'm terrified of what comes next. This is the first time the visitor has tried to make contact with me. Is it gonna be different next time?

Do any of you have any advice or thoughts on what this could be? Am I in danger? Please... I'll update again if anything notable happens. Another letter. A visit. Anything else that's worth noting. Hopefully, nothing will, but...

Well, I can only imagine it gets worse from here, right?

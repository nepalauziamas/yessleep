So a little background.  there was this guy we will call him dexter. Dexter was just an all around creepy dude. He just gave me the creeps he wasnt friendly to anyone was very rude and got into loud cussing arguments with anyone who asked him to do anything. I did my best to keep my distance. Other piece of background you need to know is about Robert hansen. The butcher baker.  He was an American serial killer between 1971-1983 in Alaska. He abducted raped and brutally murdered at least seventeen women. My last name is Hansen. Please keep in mind that is a very common last name. Also keep in mind that this story takes place when dexter and I were in middle school. 

So dexter apparently had a crush on me and he told me so. In fact he asked me to marry him with a hot wheels car in his hand. Didn’t ask me out on a date to be his girlfriend nope marry him now. He was already freaking me out. I told him no and ran off. He chased after me tackled me and tried to kiss me.  I kicked him in the you know where so he missed and kissed me on the cheek. I was screaming and was trying to get him off of me. He thankfully was pulled off and got in huge trouble. I really tried to stay away from him because he gave me the creeps even more so then he did before. One day I was walking home after a meeting for one of my academic clubs. I didn’t have to walk home often because my house was kind of far from the school but at some point I felt someone watching me. I looked around and saw dexter walking ten feet behind me. I started walking faster and was fighting the urge to sprint. He continued to follow me. 

I took a left turn that wasn’t the right direction home to see if he was following me. He followed I took a right he followed. I was scared and out of nowhere he caught up to me and started talking to me. He started talking about the butcher baker. It scared me even more and I wanted to run away. I thought about it started to walk faster. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me back and kept talking. He was saying something about how some people thought serial killers passed on a “killer gene”. Then he stopped and asked me what it felt like. I was confused he said the killer gene what does it feel like. I was still very confused. Your related to the butcher baker his last name is hansen your last name is hansen. I blinked at him are you crazy I asked him. The words had slipped out before I could stop them. He wasn’t very happy. 

He started squeezing my wrist tightly. I tried to pull away but did not succeed.  I was tall for my age but underweight and not as strong as he was. I told him he was hurting me and he needed to let me go. He told me he wasn’t crazy. He told me to keep walking home I turned toward Main Street and walked. he kept talking and asking how it felt to be related to someone so cool and fascinating. Once we got to Main Street I told him again I wasn’t related to him or at least as far as I knew. There was a bunch of stores on Main Street one was a breakfast place where a family friend worked. I worked up the nerve punched him in the face and ran toward it. I made it inside safely. He followed me inside. I told him to leave and if he didn’t I would call the police. I told him to leave me alone and if he ever spoke to me again I would get him expelled and arrested. I had no clue how to do either but it worked and he left me alone. He got expelled a month later for something unrelated. One of the scariest things of my life.

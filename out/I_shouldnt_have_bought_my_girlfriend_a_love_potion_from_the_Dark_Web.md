My hands were numb. The grainy computer screen wavered in front of my face as I sat in complete darkness. Occasionally I would get up to use the bathroom or refill my coffee, but other than that I was still. Focused.

This would all be worth it. For Hannah. For *me*.

Hannah and I first met in the first year of college. She was everything I had always dreamed of. Kind, loving, loyal as a dog. We had been together ever since I first laid eyes on her. Like a pair of inseparable magnets.

She used to come over to my house every night, but then she just…disappeared. I could not find any other explanation for why she stopped coming over or why she was suddenly avoiding me. That first night was jarring. I had everything ready—spaghetti and meatballs, glasses of our favourite red wine and the afternoon before I had gone out and bought a cheap engagement ring as a special surprise.

I waited for hours.

Hannah never came.

Neither did she come the following night, or the night after that…I started to accept she decided to focus on her studies or something. Yeah, we were both aiming for our Masters now, that made sense…

Until tonight when I walked into a bar for a quick snack and saw her talking to another guy I had never seen before and giggling and sipping a martini…

I screamed and slammed my fists against my wall until my shelves shook. I didn’t know how the other guy lured her away from me, but I wanted her back. Whatever it took.

So all that was still flashing through my mind now as I sat at my computer scrolling through options. I ventured deeper and deeper into the Internet, embracing its warmth, its reassurance, the possibility of that perfect solution.

And I found that solution only an hour later.

The website is called The Nile. To put it simply, it is the bootleg version of Amazon. But while Amazon conforms to government regulations and has the customer’s best interests at heart (sometimes), The Nile is a black market full of delightfully illegal stuff.

It is on The Nile (that I stumbled upon this evening) that I found the love potion. The seller was a jumble of letters and numbers that was nearly incomprehensible. It sold for only $30 and had free shipping.

I ordered it right away, and when I woke up the next afternoon after collapsing in bed at 5am there was a box sitting outside my front door.

*That was fast.*

Wrapped in bubble wrap was a single round-bottomed flask, sealed with a styrofoam cork. You know, the kind of cork they use in champagne. A tag was tied around its neck, and drawn on the tag was a pink heart with a red outline with what looked like crayon.

The potion itself was as red as roses, and when I shook it, little bubbles shot downwards and exploded at the bottom.

I grinned from ear to ear.

*Perfect*.

I was surprised how quickly Hannah agreed to come over for dinner. I was sure she would decline, make up some bullshit excuse on why she should not come. I hurried to prepare for this special evening. There were some ribeyes on sale at the nearby Costco and some Cajun seasoning I hastily grabbed. And oh, I didn’t forget the wine. We love wine.

It was 6pm when I finished shopping and got home. I waited with bated breath. I was sure she was going to dip out at the last minute.

But then I heard my doorbell ring, and there she was, wearing a red dress and that goofy grin I had come to love.

“Thought you would never come,” I said.

Her laugh tinkled like strawberries in a summer field. “Oh, you know I couldn’t stay away from my boyfriend for too long.”

Saying we had a great time that night was an understatement. We had a blast. The steaks were cooked to a nice rare, just how she liked it; the wine was as sweet as honey. And that love potion.I tucked it into the cabinet before she got here, but I knew it was smiling on us all.

When the meal was over she kissed me lightly on the forehead and thanked me for dinner. I watched her go, her red dress swishing from side to side, thinking how lucky I was.

The next day we had class. The boys were all clustered at the back, squabbling over something. I took a seat at the front, and I couldn’t stop dreaming of how beautiful Hannah was last night. The way she looked at me, the way she sighed at the start of every sentence—that love potion was working its magic. Literally.

Half an hour went by. My eyes flickered; the room shifted in and out of focus.

All at once I felt a rough hand on my shoulder. I looked up to see a tall boy with black hair frowning down at me. 

“Where is Ms Marie?” 

Forty minutes had gone by. Half of our lecture time was gone.

“I’m not sure,” I frowned.

I got up shakily and went to the admin office so they could page her. Around me were seas and seas of boys. No Hannah. No girls.

Even the admin office had only male staff. They called Ms Marie by the pager, and then her personal phone number. She didn’t pick either up.

When I returned to class, we all decided collectively to just skip school for the day. What was the point, we reasoned, when all the female professors were missing?

Walking home from campus was weird. I hadn’t noticed before until now how many female workers and students there were at campus. I had gotten used to teenage couples holding hands and kissing passionately on steps, and the giggles of gaggles of girls. Today it felt different. Quiet. 

A lump formed in my stomach. The road back home felt harder than usual.

The first thing I noticed when I opened the door was the rancid smell of death.

The second thing I noticed was the blood splattered on the walls, as red as marinara sauce.

The room was a complete mess. Bookshelves knocked over; drawers upturned and ransacked. Flies were buzzing around the house, and I watched as one landed on the blood and eagerly slurped it up. Bloody footprints led out of the broken window and disappeared at the fish pond.

A shiver ran down my spine. Who did this? Where’s my mum? And my sister?

*At least* I reassured myself, *The killer had left.*

But my heart thumping away at my chest convinced me otherwise.

I reached for my phone to call the police, but Hannah beat me to it.

“Hello?”

Her voice was quavering. Too much.

“Andy,” she whispered. “You there?”

“Yeah. All the girls are missing. Are you okay?”

“I know.”

She was crying. “I-I think he’s here. He’s after me now.”

My heart turned cold. “I’ll be right over.”

I sprinted to the nearest bus stop. I never wished for something to go faster in my life.

Hannah lived in a secluded part of town, in a house so unseen you wouldn’t know it was there unless you went looking for it. Tall trees cast light shadows that danced down on her house, leaving only an illuminated porch marked with a crimson door.

I opened it, only to be greeted the second time with that rancid stink of death.

Thoughts raced around my mind. My palms were sweating. I imagined Hannah dead somewhere, surrounded by flies and her own blood. *Am I too late?*

Then the lights turned on and I screamed.

Heads decorated the wall. Human heads. The heads of my mother and sister and my professors and a billion other people I both recognised and did not recognise. Their heads were stuffed with cotton, the stuffing dripping out to the floor; their faces pale with an expression of gnarly terror. The walls were painted with blood.

All the furniture was pushed to the side except for one table in the centre. Set nicely with a tablecloth and two identical glasses filled with wine. Soft jazz music played somewhere in the background.

And standing in the middle of it all was my girlfriend. Wearing that red dress and that goofy grin I had come to love.

“Surprise!” Hannah squealed.

She laughed at how fast the colour was draining out of my face as everything dawned on me all at once.

“You seriously thought I was in danger? Aw, Andy, you’re too cute!”

She gestured at the table. “Come, lunch is served!”

I sat down nervously. I glanced back at the door, but she had somehow locked it without me noticing. Hannah disappeared into the kitchen and returned with the food. Spaghetti and meatballs.

Except the spaghetti was too long and pink and the sauce was as red as the blood on the walls and the meatballs were white and staring back at me…

I stood up sharply. I couldn’t take it any longer. I needed to call the police—*anybody*—and somehow get out of here. 

“I need to go to the toilet,” I said shakily.

Hannah dropped the act. Her face was a mask of stone, and her eyes gleamed.

“No, Andy,” she growled. “Don’t you see? I did this for you. I did it to make you happy. I did it so we can be together again.”

*She’s definitely bonkers.* I told myself. It was that love potion. It *had* to be that love potion. Why the hell did I think it was a good idea to pour that thing into her drink?

Since the front door was locked, I took off deeper into her house, desperately looking for a way out. I could hear her footsteps pounding behind me. I knew what she wanted. She wanted me to sit down like a good boyfriend and finish the dinner she had made for me.

Not a chance.

One of the doors was open. I dived in, slamming and locking the door behind me. I heard the clinking of glass and made the mistake of flicking on the lights. Round-bottom flasks sat on scores and scores of shelves, each containing a crimson-coloured liquid. A label was wrapped around the neck, depicting a pink heart with a red outline drawn in crayon.

I called the police. No answer. So I thought of Reddit.

But my battery is dying down and I am getting increasingly thirsty. Worst of all, as I am typing this, calling the police every ten seconds (still not picking up!!!), I can hear Hannah’s mocking laughter seeping under the door.

“You can’t hide there forever, my dear Andy! And besides…”

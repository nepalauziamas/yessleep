I don't know what I did to deserve the hell I'm going through.I'm here hoping for some help.Anyway here we go

I'm a 44 year old male ,I'm divorced,have 2 daughters ages 18 and 12 .And I have worked at the same job since I was 20 years old

My life has always been pretty simple and ordinary for the typical American man and that was just fine by me .

But 2 days ago,that has changed 

I woke up one morning to get ready for work,as I stood up and made my way towards my bathroom to take my morning piss, something caught my eye

An eagle...a golden eagle was standing in front of the bathroom door.I stood there in astonishment and wondered how this bird of prey got in my house

The weirdest part was the fact that I don't live anywhere near where an eagle would want to be around at all.

But here was one in my own  damn bedroom.And it just stood there and stared up at me with it's big golden brown eyes.It's *hungry* golden brown eyes

I have spent my whole life in the city and only went camping one time as a little kid and nearly died of fear when a rodent ran into my open tent 

So you can correctly assume that I had no idea what to do about this while situation.

I would of yelled for my daughters but my oldest was on a school trip and my younger girl was staying at her moms for the week 

I remembered that my phone was on my nightstand behind me and I slowly started to turn around to get it to call animal control, but then it happened

It was on my back in the blink of an eye and was clawing at my back while giving a terrifying screech in my ears that drowned out my screams of pain

My vision began fading  out as I felt it destroying the back of my head with its beak and I expected to never wake up again once I went out


However I did come to, on my bedroom floor in the same position that I was attacked it.My body felt...odd

Instead of pain like I expected to feel all over myself,I felt totally fine as I got myself up off the floor.7 hours had passed..was it a dream?

That didn't make sense.I woke up at the same time that I always did in the mornings and what I felt in that attack felt *real*

But there was no sign of that bird anywhere in my room after a thorough and worried search.It was gone.

I went into the bathroom to see the damage that the damn bird inflicted on me...but I was fine.No blood,no marks...nothing

I was at a loss.And after a few more minutes of trying to rationalize everything to no avail,I realized that I missed work...fuck

I left the bathroom to get my phone and as expected,my boss called me and left a voicemail and asked where I was when I listened to it

I knew he wouldn't believe my story.I mean would you believe it if someone told you this

*I woke up to an eagle in my room and it attacked me but its gone now and I have no attack marks so that's why I couldn't come to work*...


Totally believable right?

I called him back ,and as expected he was pretty pissed when he answered, so I had to come up with a lie.

I went with the old "sudden family emergency" excuse and he thankfully cooled down and warned me to not forget to call him sooner next time

After that call ended I felt better.But I was still massively freaked out about the whole bird attack thing

How did that fucking bird get into the house? Why did it suddenly attack me? Why did it leave no signs of injury? Why did it stare at me like that?

I tried my best to forget about it and tried to relax for the rest of my day.As I managed to fall asleep later that night after some vodka shots,I had a dream

I was flying around the city ...my city.It was at night and i could see the cars, lights and people below me.I had no control of my actions.It was like a movie 

I saw a young lady walking into her home with a few bags in her hands and I quickly flew down towards her home

I flew down and stood outside her home as time seemed to pass suddenly pretty quickly,

 After a short time,I flew back up and landed on her roof and I saw that she had a chimney.As if by pure instinct , I flew down through it into her home

As my dream self walked passed a mirror, I saw myself...I was a golden eagle...the same kind that attacked me the day before

It made no sense.How was I walking normally,and had a human body but yet I  appeared as a human sized eagle in a mirror

My dream self continued waking towards the woman's bedroom door that was open and I just stood at her doorway for awhile

As soon as she woke up and saw me,my dream self wasted no time and jumped into action

I flew at her and began shredding and biting at her body  as she screamed bloody murder with a terrified look on her face

After a brief struggle,my dream-self bit into the woman's throat...and then I shot up in bed.It was morning .A nightmare.


I still had 20 minutes before work but I decided to just get an early start.When I got into the bathroom and turned inn the light.I saw my face in the mirror

It was covered in blood.I checked my nostrils to see if I had a undetected bloody nose while I slept


Nope.My nose was fine 


Fear hit me like a brick after that realization.Could it be? No..crazy right? I got in the shower and cleaned up.

Later as I was getting for work,I got a alert on my phone.My heart froze as I read what it said


*BREAKING NEWS Woman found dead in her bed.Sharp gouges on most of her body and a massive gash in her throat.Police investigating*


Her picture that was shown was the exact same woman from my dream


I called in once again to work and told my boss that I was still with my family at the moment and he was fine with it .He claimed at least 


What in the world is going on?

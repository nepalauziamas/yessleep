I didn't really know what I was getting into.

I'm a recent police academy graduate and only just managed to join the force, moving to the town of Blackthorn, Ohio and joining up there.

Blackthorn. Not even the name sounded inviting.

But I decided to ignore that. You know, looks can be deceiving and all that. And unfortunately, I would get that particular maxim hammered into my brain very quickly. For a number of reasons.

Besides, 'Officer Crystal Locks' sounded so... so cool in my head. Ugh. Why am I even saying that? I sound like a child.

But anyway, I found this diary in my backyard, even though the little girl that kept this diary clearly never lived in my cheap, one-floor house. I keep thinking someone wanted me to find it.

But the location of the diary isn't important. What matters is the contents. And I don't know whether I should turn this diary in to the rest of the force or what.

I'll be posting the seven entries a few at a time, but for now, here are the first two:

*November 3, 1961*

*Today was my seventh birthday, and I got this diary as a present. I don't really like diaries, but I'm writing in this one so as not to hurt Momma and Daddy's feelings. It was a present from both of them.*

*Polly's present was nice too, which was strange as normally she's the worst sister in the world. But she gave me a ragdoll that I liked. She sewed it herself. Its name is Susan.*

*Anyway, my own name is Thelma Denise Gabriel, and I used to be six years old until today. I don't have a favourite book. My favourite toy is Susan. My best friend is Violet Mitchell, who lives next door to me. She has blond braids, blue eyes, and don't tell her I said this, but she's a bit plump.*

*My favourite colour is red, and Violet's is purple. We wear purple and red every day. Violet's present to me was a Butterfinger.*

*My favourite food is any kind of candy, and my favourite show is Polly's favourite show. It's called The Twilight Zone and Momma says it's not 'appropriate' for me, but I always sneak into the living room to watch it whenever I get the chance and Polly doesn't notice me. And tonight, I did.*

*Tonight was the best episode ever! It was about this kid who could do all kinds of things with just his mind, and my favourite part was when he turned that mean man into a jack-in-the-box. I want a jack-in-the-box now, but I didn't get one for my birthday.*

*Just before I started writing in this diary, I saw a shooting star outside my bedroom window. I know you aren't supposed to tell wishes or else they won't come true, but diaries are private, and no one ever said you can't write your wishes. And I wished I was just as powerful, maybe even more powerful if the star can do that, than that kid on the show.*

*I have to go to bed now. Maybe my wish will have come true in the morning.*

.......

*November 4, 1961*

*Today was the best day ever! Even better than my birthday!*

*I woke up and wondered if my wish had come true, so I pointed at Susan and wished she could walk and talk. And she did!*

*She walked over to me, hugged me, and said she loved me very much. I said I loved her too!*

*I had breakfast and secretly changed my boring old cornflakes into Frosted Flakes! And Polly still had to eat stupid cornflakes!*

*When I went to Violet's house, I decided to show Violet my powers. She promised she'd keep them a secret.*

*When I did my homework, I got all my math problems right and I didn't even know them! I turned my lunch into cookies! And after lunch, me and Violet played hide and seek in a castle, in the sky, and in a carnival!*

*When I got home from playing with Violet, Momma was making brussels for dinner. I hate brussels. So for me, I turned them into a burger and it still looked like I was eating brussels!*

*But the best part is, I'm getting a new teacher on Monday. Mr Hinnaw went missing today, but no one knows I turned him into a jack-in-the-box like that kid did to that bad man in the show! He was passing by our house and said hi to me, I wished he was a jack-in-the-box, and it was that simple! He's a much better jack-in-the-box than he was a teacher.*

*I played with Susan for a while, but eventually she got boring. She's not alive anymore, just a regular ragdoll now.*

*I wonder who else I can make disappear?*

And those are only the first two entries, let me remind you.

Trust me. 

**It only gets worse.**

Whichever one of you gave me that link to the digital version of that encyclopedia thing, *thank you so much*.  [I haven’t been back to the library.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xgc73c/how_to_survive_college_im_sure_i_can_graduate/) ….I also haven’t made any progress or been back to talk to the folklore professor because procrastination is my best friend as of late.  I keep telling myself I have time to figure it out but then one of my professors was like oh don’t forget, summer semester finals are coming up and it was like wait what.  What do you mean there’s only like two weeks left in the semester.

(if you’re new, [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/rnauck/how_to_survive_the_holidays/), and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/s75n1c/how_to_survive_college_index/))

My current plan is to not study for one of my classes so that the devil is forced to show up and make sure I pass.  I can ask him questions at that time.  Questions like ‘what am I supposed to do with a pencil’ and ‘how can I get the eyeball to appear somewhere where there won’t be bystanders that could get hurt’.  Just some minor details.

In the meantime, I’ve been hanging out with Grayson.  He’s been walking me to and from class!  Which I guess could be a little creepy but there’s a reason for it.

Since he’s not taking classes and doesn’t have a summer job, he’s got plenty of time on his hands and has started showing up to walk back with me.  After we had our argument-that-kinda-wasn’t-an-argument I figured he’d stop, but no, he was there after my next class.  I’ve made it clear to him a number of times now that I’m not interested in dating and every time he’s seemed fine with that.  I still can’t help but be suspicious though, or maybe that’s just a sign that I should really do something about my social anxiety.

Not something *constructive*, of course.  Oh no.  That’s not how I am.

“Grayson, I can’t take this anymore,” I finally said to him.

Yep, good start.  I’m handling this like an adult.

“You keep saying you’re not interested in me,” I continued, “but then you show up and walk me back to my dorm all the time.  I’m really confused.”

“We’re friends,” he replied.  “Also, it’s really boring here in the summer.”

“But don’t you have like… other friends?”

“No, I don’t, actually.”

So then I just felt like an ass.  I mean, I *get it*, I don’t have that many friends either and sometimes I feel like it’s just Grayson, Cassie, and Maria and the only reason I know anyone else at all is because of Cassie.  She just pulls me along in her wake and her friends find me tolerable and that’s as far as I’ll ever get with anyone.

Tolerable.

Which made Grayson’s behavior both make sense and also seem wildly unusual at the same time.  Like he’s as desperate as I am but at the same time… me?  Really?  There’s no one else he could have picked instead?

“I didn’t have many close friends in highschool,” he said, “and the few I had went to school somewhere else and I lost touch with them during freshman year.  I know a couple people around campus but they all went home for the summer.”

“So I guess we’re in the same predicament.”

“Is it really a predicament?”

I wasn’t sure about that.  I was popular back home.  Sort of.  It was more like everything *around* me was what made me popular.  My sister was only a few years older than me and everyone liked her.  Then she married her highschool sweetheart almost as soon as they graduated and that was romantic and interesting and there I was with a boyfriend of my own and we naturally assumed the title of the ‘popular couple’ at school.

But me?  On my own?  I didn’t have anything going for me.

Naturally I shared all of this with Grayson because nothing says ‘friendship’ like dumping all of your insecurity on someone.

“What about you?” I asked.  “I’ve shared my sorry story of why I’m a pathetic loser.”

“You’re not a loser,” he replied absently, but he wasn’t really paying attention to me anymore.

He was staring out at the horizon, a worried look on his face.  Then he turned to face me.  We were close to my dorm and getting near the spot Grayson usually said goodbye.

“The forecast calls for scattered showers today,” he said urgently.  “I’ve got a bad feeling though.  Are you done with classes?”

“Yeah, I am.  I’ll stay inside if it rains.”

“Even if it’s sprinkling, okay?”

I was taken off-guard by the urgency of his request.  His gaze was locked on my face, searching for an honest answer.  I guess I can’t blame him for being paranoid, I’m the person that recruited him to go searching for a kelpie in the middle of the night.

“I do like being your friend,” he continued, “but I need to be honest - it’s not the only reason I’m walking you back from class.  There’s something the locals say about the campus.”

Back home, it was the winter season that brought all the monsters sniffing around.  Perhaps it was a reprieve for Kate, who didn’t have to deal with campers anymore, but the rest of the town knew to hunker down and wait out the long nights.  That wasn’t the case here.

Summer is the starvation season.

The students have mostly gone home and the pickings are lean.  The townsfolk stay away from campus during the summer, in case something is bold enough to snatch them up.  Even the ones that claim they don’t believe are wary of the college.  It doesn’t feel right, they say.

If it’s true, the creatures here will be getting desperate.  The summer semester is close to its last few weeks.

And here I thought the creeping unease I’ve been feeling this whole time is because I’m being stalked by a giant inhuman eyeball.

Well.  I mean.  It’s probably that too.

I’m not sure how I function most days, tbh.

I promised Grayson I wouldn’t go out.  Satisfied, he left, and I went inside to my dorm room.

Two hours later my phone notified me that I had class in thirty minutes.  Yeah, so it’s Wednesday that I don’t have a class in the afternoon.  Mondays though?  I absolutely have an afternoon class.

It wasn’t raining when I left the dorm.  I kept my promise to Grayson for that long.  Once I was in the classroom, though, I half-listened to the professor and stared moodily at the window as the rain came and went.  The clouds broke and reformed again and again, spitting raindrops on the glass before petering out once more.  It wouldn’t make up its mind while I was in class, but I feared it’d finally settle on a downpour as soon as I stepped foot outside of the building.  I contemplated messaging Grayson and seeing if he’d pick me up, seeing as he had a car and campus wasn’t busy.

I’d just decided to message him when I heard a door bang open somewhere down the hallway.  We *all* heard it.  A couple students looked up and then turned their attention back to their notes, dismissing it as nothing more than another student.  I, however, was frozen in place.

I’d heard this before.  This exact sound.

But it was in a different building.  And I hadn’t fallen asleep this time.  None of us had, to my knowledge.

Rule #2 - If you fall asleep in class and no one is around when you wake up, stay at your desk. Pretend you’re taking notes. Don’t look up and don’t look around, no matter what you hear. You’ll be returned to your classroom when it leaves.

I began to write in my notebook with feverish intensity, straining to hear what was happening in the hallway as the teacher droned on.

The lights in the hallway began to flicker.  Some more students turned to look and then we heard the sliding - the scraping - and everyone was looking.

Someone asked the professor what was going on outside.  The professor didn’t answer.  Like we were no longer there.

And we weren’t.  The lizard brain in the back of my skull was screaming at me that this thing was here where it shouldn't be and this time it wasn’t just me trapped in that otherworldly space, it was *all of us.*

We’re not a big class.  Perhaps the university could smooth it over if we all vanished.

“I know what’s going on,” I said, my voice shrill and high with fear.  “I’ve seen this thing before.  Just focus on taking notes.  Don’t look up.  Just take notes.”

I expected them to argue, but the handful of people in the room with me obeyed without hesitation.  I think they felt it too, the pressure over our heads, the tingling on the back of our spines.  And that noise!  A scraping, grinding noise, the creaking of the walls as they struggled to contain something that should not fit in the hallway.  The frantic blinking of the lights, growing ever more frenzied as it drew closer to our classroom.

Then the lights all went out.  Outside, the sun was covered by clouds and a light drizzle began.  The room was plunged into a muted half-light.  I could no longer hear the teacher’s words.  The only sound was the beating of my heart, the rapid breathing of the panicked students around me, the scratching of pens, and the slow and steady inhale and exhale of the thing lurking in the hallway.

Watching.  Waiting.

Where was the eyeball?  Why wasn’t it showing up, if it was following me around?  This would be a *great* time for it to make an appearance, I thought frantically.

Because that creature didn’t seem ready to move on.

Finally, someone’s nerve broke.  The person next to me.  I saw out of the corner of my eye their head jerk up.  They looked at the hallway.  The rest of their body followed, flowing smoothly out of the chair and pivoting to stare through the window separating the classroom from the rest of the building.

“Oh,” she said, her voice high in awe.  “Of course.  Of course!  I’m coming!”

She ran lightly for the door.  I heard it open and then fall gently shut behind her.

A few seconds passed.

And then we heard the cracking.  Anyone that has ever eaten a plate of chicken wings knows what I’m talking about.

Bones breaking.  Tendons popping.  There were no screams, but there was a sharp pop and then a soft gurgle that subsided into a brief splash of liquid onto the linoleum floor.

Someone was crying behind me.  I couldn’t focus on the notes in front of me.  My paper was damp with sweat dripping off my brow and I wrote the letter ‘c’ over and over again, one after another.  I silently mouthed the words ‘don’t look’, though I was too frightened to say them out-loud.  I could only hope that no one else broke.

I had to hope that *I* wouldn’t break.

Because it wasn’t leaving.  I could hear its heavy breathing and the creak of the walls around it as it waited, perched outside our classroom like a bird waiting for the worm to emerge.  How long was it going to stay there?  It felt like it was waiting far longer than it had when I encountered it.  And why was it here, in *this* building?  Was I wrong about it being confined to one spot?  Could it appear in any building on campus?

Someone near the front row dropped their pen.  It clattered on the floor and everyone, myself included, jumped.  Someone even shrieked.  For a moment, no one moved, paused in their note-taking, waiting to see if that break in concentration would be enough for the creature in the hallway to claim another victim.

The student that dropped their pen slowly turned to pick it up, careful to keep their back to the hallway.  I was so focused on them that I almost missed what was happening to my right.

The student that shrieked.  His breathing was speeding up, to the point where he was almost hyperventilating.  Then he stood.

“No no no no no,” he whimpered, his words growing ever more frantic as his feet carried him unwillingly down the aisle.

Towards the door.

There were more students weeping now.  He was yelling at us, begging us to help him, crying that he didn’t want to die.  I heard the clack of the door handle turning.  My hand was white knuckled around my pen.  Where was the damn eyeball!?  Why was it ignoring this when it hadn’t ignored the kelpie or the library ghost?

“Okay, that’s enough of that,” a voice said in the hallway.

The door remained closed.  The student stopped moving inexorably towards the hallway.  Everyone in the classroom froze, breathing hard, hanging on the newcomer’s words.  Someone was *out there*, with that creature.

It rumbled in response.  There were no words.  Just a sound like grass cracking and pressure against my chest, like the bass notes from a subwoofer.

“We’re *all* hungry,” he said.  “But there are *rules.*”

Why did its voice sound so familiar?

“They’re really not in a mood to be defied,” he continued in response to the creature’s rumblings.  “You know what happened to the laundry lady, right?”

Silence for a moment.

“Yeah, I thought so,” he sighed.  “Go on then.  Get back to where you belong and hope they overlook you snatching a little snack.”

More scraping from the hallway.  The creature was moving on.  No one was writing notes anymore.  We all just stared at the surface of our desks, frozen in terror and the dawning relief of realizing we were going to survive.  My mind was fixed on the sound of that other entity’s voice.  I’d *heard* it before.

As the lights flicked back on in the hallway and the only sound left was the rain on the windows, I remembered.

The flickering man.  The one darting between the raindrops who had spoken to me as I fled with Steven.

He was here, reminding the hallway creature of *rules* that had to be followed.

“Okay, we’re done for the day,” the professor said abruptly.  “Make sure to turn your homework in online.”

I’m not sure what he thought when the assembled students scrambled to grab their backpacks and bolted for the door, especially since a couple were still crying.  No one stopped to enlighten him, either.  We just ran for it, collectively deciding to get out of there as fast as we could.

“What the hell was that?!” someone yelled as soon as we were in the building lobby.

Predictable way to start with predictable results.  Everyone collapsed into panicked chatter, someone started crying again, and there was the usual frenzied chaos of bad suggestions.  Call the police, call campus security, march to the administration building and demand answers.  I waited for their anxious panic to spend itself somewhat before I spoke up.

“We don’t tell anyone,” I said.

Look at me.  Taking charge like I know what I’m doing.  Like I have any *right* to.  That worked out so well with the Rain Chasers, didn’t it?

“The university knows,” I continued, dropping my voice and they all crowded in closer.  “You heard what that other thing said, right?”

“It said there were rules,” one of them said slowly.

There was a pensive silence as the implications of that sunk in.  I used that time to dig into my backpack and pull out the sheets of paper I carried around in the vain hope they’d be useful someday.  Well, that day had finally come.  I shoved them at my classmates.

“These are *my* rules,” I said.  “How to survive this college.”

I didn’t get quite the reaction I wanted.  I wanted… I guess I wanted them to thank me, at least.  Perhaps that was asking for too much.  They were still in shock, reeling from the fact that our class was now permanently one less and we were helpless to do anything but sit there and listen to her being eaten on the other side of the windows.  At least they took the list of rules.  Then they stumbled off, dazed, and walked away without another word to each other.

At least the rain was ending when we all left the building.

I think… one of them did go to the administration or campus security about this.  Because when our class met next, we were short two students instead of the expected one.  I grabbed a couple of them in the hallway after class ended and asked what they knew of the missing person.

Half of them didn’t remember the girl that was eaten in the hallway.  Some of them didn’t remember either student.

The flickering man seems to have more sentience than some of the creatures on campus.  I wonder… if he followed us in the remaining drizzle that day, waiting to see who would try to do anything more than pretend nothing had happened.  I wonder if he snatched them up as a meal for himself.

There are rules.  There is something here with us that even the inhuman things must obey.

I think I understand now what the eyeball’s purpose is.  It isn’t here to protect the students from these creatures.  It went after the kelpie because the kelpie was outside of the university’s control.  An old creature with its own rules and no master it answered to.

The library ghost was trying to help me.  It tries to help anyone that happens to be caught up in the flood.  It sought to warn us away from Patricia and I have to think it knew something of what she was doing.  The ghost is on the side of the students and I think the eye targeted him not because he’s unnatural, but because the eye doesn’t *want* him to save anyone.

Inhuman things have to feed somehow, after all.

If it’s a weapon for the administration, then it means not only does the administration know what’s happening, but *they want it to continue.*

The eye is here to maintain the status quo.

Even if that means students die as a result.

I’m too afraid to even think about the other possibility.  The one that I’m sure all of you have been considering as well.

That perhaps this college is ancient land and somewhere is a being that *everyone*, administration and inhuman alike, must bend the knee to.  And *that* is the eye’s master.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

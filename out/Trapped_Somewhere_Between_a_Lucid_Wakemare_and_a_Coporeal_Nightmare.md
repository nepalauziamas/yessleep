I haven't slept in days. I'm running low on amphetamine and coffee; I don't think I'll last much longer. I don't want to go back to sleep again, I don't know if I can go to sleep again just yet. I keep hearing its marching every now and again somewhere in the background still. This thing is too fucking good at staying hidden from the light.

Everything started days ago, not sure how many… They've been bleeding into each other now. Maybe six, maybe seven… somewhere around that mark. Yeah. Somewhere around that time frame. A week without sleep, that's the longest I've ever gone. Pretty cool I guess, if I wasn't this messed up by exhaustion, anxiety, and that freak running around inside of my house.

Where was I? Oh yeah, I'm an insomniac so, it's pretty hard for me to sleep sometimes, and boy when I do get to sleep it's a blessing. So, when that thing showed up and robbed me of my sleep, I lost it, I admit this much, I lost it.

I remember waking up, feeling something was standing over me. I opened my eyes but I couldn't see anything. I looked around seeing nothing, and nothing was there but the feeling of something watching me grew ever more intense. The gaze of darkness was penetrating deeper and deeper into my mind. My anxious mind started turning its gears. Nothing too malicious, just thoughts, endless thoughts. Firing off, faster and faster until I saw some movement in the periphery of my eye.

The quiet before the storm, brain activity slumped to a screeching halt before the floodgates of madness burst open ajar. The thought of an intruder kept racing inside of my head with an ever-increasing intensity as I slowly rose up in my bed into a seated position.

An explosive sound of a chair falling somewhere beyond the hall went off. The dread had overflown the dams of my sanity, pushing the brain to pump out adrenaline into the system. My heartbeat mimicked the engine of a racecar as I tip-toed my way into the hall, carefully tracing my hand along the walls. Making sure I turn on the light in each room I pass.

There was hope in my mind that it would discourage the intruder and force him to run away. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. I heard something being broken in the kitchen. A sound that prompted my mind to change gears, dread turned to angry bravado. I bolted into the kitchen screaming like a madman. My hand hit the light switch and everything stopped again. The stillness of time was broken by the horror in front of me, screeching and bellowing in inhuman ways.

A naked, misshapen human pretzel stood in front of me, its face covered in a brown substance. A terrible stench assaulted my nostrils. My heartbeat pounding in my ears. Arms over crossed over each other, one leg in the air, another tubbed behind a bald wrinkled head. The mouth and eyes are reversed in position. Wrinkles, very visible wrinkles – an obvious sign of a horribly twisted neck.

My screaming, intertwined with the monster's deafening everything in sight. I can swear our collective song must've shattered the glass in the kitchen. Otherwise, I remained frozen as the creature awkwardly balanced all four of its contorted limbs in a mindboggling angular fashion. Almost rolling itself towards me, as it roared and barked. It seemed to move in slow motion while in reality, it was almost flying towards me. The stench of shit and old was closing in on me.

Before I knew it, a rough, stony, jagged limb pushed me to the floor as the creature bolted towards the darkness of the night. A wave of burning cold shivers smashed against my already tense frame as the beast disappeared into the nothing. I spend the rest of that night in the same position, too afraid to move. When day broke, I was finally calm and tired enough to get up.

As I got around to assessing the damage, I found something that forced me back into a shellshocked state – bloody shit stains all over the floor. The stench of death returned once more, it was closer than ever, that's when I noticed the red-brown mark on my pants. In the shape of a hand. I fell onto my ass, nearly killing myself in the process at the realization that thing had touched me.

I honestly don't remember the rest of that day but when night came and my head was becoming truly too heavy to hold upright, I remember looking out of my window and seeing a pair of bright eyes at an awkward angle.

A row of jagged teeth suddenly appeared above the eyes. Every fiber in my body turned to stone as a low grumbling noise trailed off behind me before disappearing into the dark along with the eyes and teeth.

Ever since that moment, I keep seeing that thing at the edge of my field of vision, I keep hearing its disgusting sounds as it roams the house. Occasionally, I can even taste its odor penetrating my mouth as my body attempts to doze off, before immediately jolting awake - shaking in terror.

I haven't slept since - trapped somewhere between a lucid wakemare and a corporeal nightmare.

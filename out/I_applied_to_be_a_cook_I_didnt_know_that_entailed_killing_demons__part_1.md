The sun beat down upon me with unrelenting fury. My confident walk had slowed to a crippled meander as I lazily crossed the parking lot. It’d been a few months since I had last held down a steady job, depression taking a firm grip over my life at that time. However, the last couple of weeks I had a surge of confidence which propelled me forth, back into the workforce. 

I had managed to land a job at a Bar & Grill in a small town a few miles away from where I live. ‘Chickeez’ is the name of the place. Based off the name, I’m sure you could figure out that they’re most well known for their chicken related products. Despite the recent surge in people’s love for chicken sandwiches, I can’t help but notice how dead the place always seems to be. I chalked that up to being in a small town and the local farmers hadn’t got off work yet. 

Sometime after 5 is when you can find a handful of haggard souls drowning there sorrows in a glass.

I had visited the place once before, though I hadn’t noticed how shabby it really was. The red paint which loosely adorned the wooden exterior was weathered and peeling. The roof was missing shingles and door hung cockeyed, leaning heavily on the frame. A large, rusted statue of a chicken stood at the corner of the building, the oddly humanoid eyes painted on its face seemed to follow me as I walked closer. 

Obviously delirium had set in from the heat. 

I pulled at the knob once and the door hardly budged. The longer I lingered outside in the heat the more frustrated I became. I pulled at the knob once more, harder this time, and the door reluctantly gave way. A blast of cool air greeted me as I stepped through the portal and into the dungeonous building. 

Much like my last visit to Chickeez, the bar area was dim and vacant of any human activity, save for the old bartender. 

“How’s it goin’, Spud”, he greeted with a smile, revealing rows of crooked, stained teeth. Apparently Spud was my nickname now... oh well. 

I gave a halfhearted wave and quickly made my way to the kitchen, a pair of saloon styled doors separating it from the dining/bar area. 

The kitchen, much like the rest of Chickeez, is in complete disarray. The actual grill, the fryers, and prep table were perfectly clean, practically brand new. However, there were two massive, rectangular chunks missing out of the wall. Sitting in their sills were a row of stacked sandbags, and outside of them was a fence which stood a little higher than that. 

During my first visit I had a hard time controlling the shocked look on my face, however the chef must’ve noticed as he cited it as being ‘under construction’. Pretty sure that’s a health code violation. 

I didn’t really expect the place to be overly clean or professional, considering they’d taken me in with zero experience. Still, the holes in the wall were a bit concerning. 

A tall, slim man in a stained chefs coat was leaned against the prep table as I made my way inside. Paul is the head chef at Chickeez, and only other kitchen employee aside from me. His skin was dark, aged by the sun, and the many poorly drawn tattoos which covered his arms were nothing more than blobs at this point. His shaved head showed a massive scar which stretched from the crown all the way to his brow. 

If you hadn’t talked to him before, you’d guess he was a roughed up, old, junkie. Truthfully, he was one of the sweetest, gentle people I had ever met. His hardened gaze softened as I turned to greet him. 

“How goes it, brother?”, he said before taking a long drag off his cigarette. Probably another health code violation. 

“Ready to get started”, I said, returning a smile towards him. 

My first shift was on a Monday and only lasted from 5 PM to 9 PM. Most likely to get me familiarized with how the kitchen runs. The hours flew by quickly as Paul and I shot the shit about many different things, about life. I think we only had about three tickets that entire night. 

We spent another hour after closing time getting the kitchen cleaned up and ready for the morning crew. However, I hadn’t noticed the various guns and ammunition that Paul had begun pulling out and stacking on the prep table.

“What the fuck, dude?”, the words escaped my mouth, my heart began pumping madly.

“Chill man, you really thought your first shift was gonna be that easy?”, he replied coolly before lighting up another cigarette. 

I was at a loss for words, staring dumbly at Paul as my legs began to turn to jelly. Truthfully, even though I had been raised on a farm I had never shot a gun before. Besides, why would I need a gun when I’m the cook?

“It’s all good, rookie. I’ve been doin’ this shit for twelve years y’know, I ain’t gonna let anything happen to ya’”, he continued as he laid one of the many firearms in either of the ‘window’ sills. 

“Paul, what do you mean... what’s this for?”, I said, my words spilling out in spurts of anxiety fueled gibberish. 

“Too much to explain right now, brother...”, he looked at me, a tinge of sympathy washing over his face, “I can’t do this shit forever, and you seemed like a good fit... farm boy and all”, he said with a shrug. 

With that he turned and took aim out the window, the bug zappers outside illuminating the thin line of smoke which emanated from the cherry of his cigarette. 

“Watch and learn, Rook, watch an-“, a single, explosive blast rang out, shattering the peaceful evening atmosphere. It wasn’t the blast which startled me most, but the loud, inhuman shriek which quickly followed. 

“First one of the night, buddy”, he said, pulling a pistol from the holster and handing it to me, “I’ll letcha’ get the next”.

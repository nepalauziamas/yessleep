 

My name is Shay, I work a boring desk job in the town of Louisberg, KS, and haven't had anything crazy happy until very recently. Now this started at the beginning of this year. I remember everybody wishing goodbye to 2021 and saying hello to 2022. I was with some of my buddies celebrating at a bar and we had met a whole bunch of people.

One that stood out was this girl. Polite, blonde, small, pretty, and also very drunk. Her name was Izzy. Me and her talked for a while before the friends she was with left and took her with them. Before she had left I got her number. An hour later I left with my friend Zach and went home. The next day I tried to text her with no answer. 

About a week later I learned that she went missing after leaving that bar. Nobody knew where she went, the friends she was with claimed that they stopped on a road with a forest on each side and she got out to go pee. She walked into the woods and never came back. The police brought them in for further questioning but haven't released the transcript to the public. 

I had a really bad feeling about all of it. I felt like something wasn’t being mentioned, that someone was hiding something. But I couldn’t do anything.

Not yet anyways. 

I found one of the friends at a coffee shop the following week so I sat with her. She recognized me.

“Hey Shay.” 

“Hey.” 

“Have you seen Izzy since New Years?” She asked me, seemingly stressed and looks like she hasn’t had a full night sleep since 

“No, I actually wanted to ask you about that.” 

“Well, I don’t have any idea on where she went or what happened to her.” Her eyes looked away from mine.

“Morgan was it? Just wanna ask if you’ve maybe seen something that stood out to you after Izzy didn’t come back.”

“….N… no there was nothing. She just disappeared after heading into the woods” She said, still refusing to look me in the eyes.

“No sounds of ruffling leaves, no screaming, no bangs or anything like that?” I probed further

“What are you a cop now?” Aggression coming out of her voice. “If you’re so curious you can just go look in the woods yourself.” 

Before I could reply she got up and walked out of the shop. *Well hell, that was pointless.* I thought to myself. *Maybe I should go find a search party to find her.* I thought as I stood up and walked out. I walked straight to the police station. I asked the guy at the front desk, Matthew, if anybody was organizing a search party for Izzy. He said yes and gave me the information of the person who’s organizing it.

“Just remember my friend, If trouble doesn’t come looking for you, no reason to go looking for trouble.”

“Thanks.”

I turned around as he wished me luck. I don’t know what he meant with his reminder but I went back to my home contemplating whether or not to actually join this search. Eventually I decided to go through with it.

That was a couple days ago. The search party went out yesterday. I’m still confused about the events that transpired, my memory is quite hazy. Here’s what I remember.

I was told to meet at a parking lot on the outskirts of town. When I got there some of the people on the search party were there. Zach was there too. I parked my car and got out to talk with him.

“So what’s got you coming out here, Zach?” 

“I’m good friends with Izzy’s brother so I’m here to help him. Why are you here?”

“I wanna be sure she’s safe. And one of her friends aggressively told me to.”

Zach let out a little chuckle. “It seemed you and Izzy really hit it off on new years.”

“Yeah, I kinda regret not tagging along whenever they left.”

“Hey, you couldn’t have known this would happen. Don’t worry about it. We’ll find her and bring her back.”

“I hope so.”

We talked for a little longer when the last person showed up. We all gathered together and listened to the leader of this search. I think his name was Jackson. He told us that we would split into groups of 4 and explore different areas of the forest. He split up the groups and I was with him, Zach, and a guy named Joseph. 

We walked to the area that Jackson had picked out for our group. We planned to be out during the night so Jackson handed us flashlights and grabbed a map out of his back, then we went off into the woods. 

It only felt like we were out for an hour but the sun came down so fast. Before we knew it, it was pitch black outside, we used our flashlights but still could hardly see anything. I couldn’t shake this feeling that we were being watched. It didn’t help that every couple of minutes or so I would hear this strange clicking sound. 

“What the hell is that?” Zach asked, highly alarmed.

“Maybe it’s an animal?” Joseph piped up

“No, I’ve heard a lot of animal noises and this is not one.”

“Well what if-” 

Before Joseph could finish what he was saying, something sprinted past us. We couldn’t tell what it was. We stood in silence for what felt like hours. We all made a silent agreement that we needed to get out. Now. We chose a direction and sprinted that way. We didn’t stop or think for one second. We didn’t have time. We ran until we were blocked by a fence. We struggled to catch our breath. We put our backs to the fence. Joseph decided to look to see what was beyond the fence and see if we could jump it. What he saw I don’t know. Because his head flew off seconds later. It was disgusting. His neck squirting blood. His body falling down. Getting dragged away right before our eyes.

“Shay!”

I heard Jackson’s panicked scream as he grabbed onto the fence. Some creature was pulling on him. It was humanoid, but its body was contorted and grotesque, one of its knees were bent out of place. Its back was horribly curved. It was extremely pale and had long nails. Its hand was backwards. Something was coming out of its mouth. I want to vomit thinking about it now. The scream Jackson let out after it buried its hand into his back, I’ve never heard a more agonizing scream. It was a scream of pure desperation and pain. And I just watched. Jackson getting ripped to pieces. Zach grabbed me and dragged me away. All I could do was watch. The image is just burnt in my eyes as I type this to you all. Me and Zach got away after I was able to take my eyes off of what was happening. This thing. It was Izzy. She had a distinct tattoo on the back of her hand. The hand that was backwards. I had a good view of it.

This week I’m planning on going back. I need to find out what’s going on. I need to find out if Jackson is going to become like Izzy is. I don’t know if I’ll make it back but, I’ve got to try. I’ll keep you posted friends.

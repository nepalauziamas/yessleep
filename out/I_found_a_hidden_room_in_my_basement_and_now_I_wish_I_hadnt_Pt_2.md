The grandfather clock in the front room hasn’t worked in years. I’ve been thinking of having it repaired but haven’t gotten around to it. I know. Why is this guy talking about his broken clock?

Two nights ago, it started working again. I was sitting on the couch reading when it started ticking again. I looked up from my book to see the hands moving in opposite directions. After a few seconds of this, it stopped again. The hands are now fixed at 3:15. I tried moving them, but it’s like they’ve been welded in place.

I know that sounds trivial, but have you ever been in a silent house and had a clock suddenly start on its own after years of dormancy? It was creepy. I stood up and slowly made my way out of the living room to the stairs. A dark mass (and to be honest, I don’t know what else to call it - it was an area of complete darkness) was moving through the hallway from the kitchen toward the basement door.

It could have been a trick of light since the sun had just set and I hadn’t turned on the hall lights. Whatever it was, I felt super uneasy being here alone. After flipping on the hall lights and turning on the basement light, I started to feel a bit foolish. There was nothing happening, nothing around. The rooms in the basement were closed, so it couldn’t have hidden anywhere. Not that fast, anyway.

The room I found in the basement was closed as well, so it couldn’t have gone in there. I swear none of this happened before I discovered that goddamned journal.

Speaking of the journal, I have read most of the letters. There are plenty of topics covered, and each letter seems to be hinting at something more significant than the subject at hand. I’m failing to make a direct connection between them and the journals.

I should mention the bowl. It has to be the bowl from the journal. We all know LBH is Levi Boone Helm. His initials are carved in the bottom of the fucking thing. Just knowing that I’m holding the same bowl that he once drained his victims into is harrowing.

I called the local university to see if they might be interested in it. A professor of history and world religions reached out via email, saying he’d like to see it. I’m hoping to meet with him tomorrow. There’s enough creepiness happening around my house already, so having the bowl taken out of here could only help.

A local “paranormal investigator” reached out to me. She wants to visit the property and investigate the room. I’m typically a complete skeptic about things like this, but recent events have changed my outlook. Who knows, maybe Bigfoot is real?

On that note, how about a subject change?

My neighbor stopped by yesterday. I’m positive it was her because she brought back a novel I loaned her a few months back. She wanted to talk about the other night. I apologized for freaking her out, and that’s when she dropped this on me.

“*I’ve been seeing and hearing strange things at your home for years. The previous owner had a few run-ins with what she called her “resident spirit.” I remember her discussing it with the realtor that sold you the house. I figured you already knew about it.*”

So even the realtor who sold me this place knew about the strange happenings here.

She went on:

*There always seemed to be something off about this place. Doris, the previous owner, and I were pretty close. We’d have each other over for holiday gatherings and the like. Her husband, Gary, was a nice enough guy who spent almost all of his spare time locked up in the upstairs spare room. He had a huge model train set that he spent more money and attention on than he ever did Doris. She didn’t even notice he hadn’t come out of that room all day, then checked on him that evening when she found him dead. Heart attack. He died at the old age of 53.*

*After he died, she started to stay in more and became less connected to her friends. We all tried to keep her involved, but with his pension and all, she didn’t want for anything. So she stayed in and did god knows what.*

*She was a few years older than me and sold the place to you when she was 62. Now she would be 69 or 70. After she sold it, she came by my place to say goodbye.*

*I was sad to see her go, though our last meeting was…strange. She actually left something for you, but with the instruction that I don’t deliver it until it’s time. Well, I think she meant now.*

She reached into her bag and produced a box wrapped in paper. It was tied with twine and had a bit of dust on the top. She clearly hadn’t opened it.

*Now I don’t want to know what’s inside that box. It’s been a thorn in my side for seven years. Every time I looked at it, I just remembered my old friend Doris. When she left my place that day, she apparently stopped at the bank, her lawyer, and the hardware store.*

*She was discovered a few days later up near Horsetooth Rock. The poor woman had taken her own life. Left everything to a Native American fund that works to give reparations for the horrible way children were taken from their families. I had no idea she was so passionate about the cause.*

At this point, Stephanie fell quiet for a moment. She only snapped out of her reverie at the offer of a strong drink. We sat on the front porch and knocked back a few glasses of whiskey. She finished her first before I had even sat down.

I asked her if she’d ever seen a man in my window. She faltered for a moment, clearly trying to find the right words.

*I’ve seen…shapes. I wouldn’t say it was a man, woman, or anything of the like. Your windows have never been prime viewing for me, so I tend to keep the blinds closed on that portion of the house. There have been times when I’d be out in the garden and have the feeling of being watched, but when I’d glance around, all I’d see was the fluttering of a curtain or, this was usually the case, nothing.*

We drank in silence for a moment when she added:

*Once, when Gary was still alive, I was out back on a lawn chair, getting some sun. I felt eyes on me and looked up to see him standing in the top floor window, smiling. I waved, and he returned the wave. He looked…unnatural. His smile seemed bigger, even sinister. It was almost like looking at a cutout like those they had at Blockbuster Video. Except for the waving. His hand looked like it was connected to a spring or something and was waving in an utterly exaggerated manner.*

*I got up, put on my robe, and started towards my kitchen door. Just then, Gary and Doris pulled into the driveway. I have no idea who or what that was in the window, but to say it startled me is an understatement.*

I thought back on the man I had seen. She described almost the same being as I witnessed. After her tale, she thanked me for the whiskey and took her leave.

I sat out on my porch for a few more minutes, sipping my drink and letting everything sink in.

Inside there was a package waiting for me. I didn’t want to open it. Have you ever been confident that something terrible would happen if you did a thing?

I got up, gathered the glasses, and headed into the kitchen, grabbing the package only way.

So, of course, I shook it, rattled it, and did everything else I could think of to figure out what was in it without actually untying the string. It didn’t work.

I felt like a cheesy kids’ movie actor, poking a box while hiding behind my counter. So I stood up, did a quick power pose, and unwrapped it. The string came right off. The parchment it was wrapped in peeled back to reveal a small, ornate box.

It looks like some type of Native American design and is expertly carved out of bone.

A leather strap wrapped around the box with a carved hook clasp.

I gently opened the clasp and lifted the lid. Inside were three small objects, each delicately wrapped in finely woven cloth.

My first thought was to get some tweezers to unwrap the cloth. The first item was a smooth black rock with green flecks in it. It’s incredibly smooth, and the green flecks almost glow.

I set the stone on the counter and thought about what I had here. My next thought was, “holy shit! How old is this stuff?” And that thought reminded me that I have no right disturbing ancient Native American artifacts. I carefully wrapped the stone, placed it in the box, and made a call to the people to whom I donated the rug.

They thanked me for the call, and I was put on hold after I explained the situation.

I swear it was half an hour later when someone finally picked up.

*Sorry for the wait. I wasn’t in the office when you called. My assistant called me and put you on hold till I got here.*

*Tell me in detail what happened and where you found the container.*

I told my tale again, from the journal to the black stone. She listened intently, only interrupting for further detail on a few things.

*I will come to your home as soon as I can gather some necessary ingredients. It’s going to take a few days, so I’ll call when I’m coming. Please stay safe, keep the container closed, and wash the counter where the stone touched it. Were you wearing gloves at the time?*

I confessed that I hadn’t been. A foolish mistake on my part.

*In that case, you need to wash. A lot. If you have sage, rub it in your hands for at least a few minutes. Longer if you can.*

She told me not to go to the hospital. There was nothing they could do about ancient spiritual rites. Then, as if mockingly, she told me to sleep well.

I hung up the phone, opened my spice cabinet, and dumped all the sage I had on my hands. After a few minutes, it started to burn.

I don’t mean my hands burned. The sage literally started smoking, then burst into flames. I dropped it on the counter and watched in shock as the sage burned. It shifted around on the counter and formed the shape of a skull.

Then it stopped. My counter now has a skull shape burned into it, though there’s no longer any sage to be found. It disappeared or was utterly combusted.

What in the hell?

After a few more glasses of whiskey, I made my way to bed. This was last night. When I awoke this morning, everything seemed fine. Until I opened my bedroom door. Every knife I own was buried to the hilt in the hall’s walls.

The door to the spare bedroom at the opposite end of the hallway stood open. I swear I saw the shadow of little kids in there again.

I walked into the hall and was again met with the smell of cooked meat. What the fuck is happening in my house? I noped the fuck out and grabbed my cell, laptop, and keys. I’m at a coffee shop now, waiting for a call back from the investigator. Maybe she can help. Between her and the people with the tribe I called, I hope this gets sorted. If not, I’m moving.

Alex and I grew close while we were in elementary school. We bonded over our favorite television shows. He was the oldest between the two of us, and in a way he became the big brother I never had. We met on the playground and biked home together the same evening. Our Florida town was little but we went everywhere in it. Our region seemed vast to us. We both came from single father households. This commonality brought us closer together. Though I did not know him for long, he became my best friend in little time.

We swam in the many lakes close to our neighborhoods, but the one we preferred was near a dense grove. Blood orange trees were a half mile from the body of water. They sat on a sandy field in front of a mansion with Scandinavian architecture. Stories circulated in local folklore about a witch who lived on the property. Rumor was she had cursed the trees. She cast a spell to ensure that every time one of the citrus fruits fell, someone in our town would die. We all heard these yarns and believed them until we were old enough to be skeptical of the myth. The trees belonged to a family of stagecoach magnates of significant influence. This led many to believe the stories were an allegory to teach kids not to steal. All I know is I did see one of the oranges hit the ground on our way to the beach the day of the incident.

I did not witness the moments of him drowning. My back was to the shoreline. I stared out at twelve foot trees which sat on some green hills a half mile from where I stood. They swayed in the wind and left me mesmerized. When I turned around, I saw him floating. Nothing was morbid about it in the moment. I was too young to have a mature grasp on the meaning of life and death, let alone the loss of someone so young. I did have the clarity of mind to wave down a couple on date in a white Cadillac a thousand feet away. I found out when I grew older how the area had a reputation for being a local lover’s lane. I of course had no idea what that meant at the time. They made a 911 call after I pointed at my friend. I never forgot their expressions.

It took years of therapy to try and heal. Inevitable guilt ate me alive in adolescence and later on.

I became an art curator for a museum in Ft. Lauderdale after College, a job I still hold. My shrink told me my choice of occupation was a direct result of the trauma. She said it was me overcompensating for the lack of attentiveness I felt I had shown during the tragedy. Making a career out of focusing on specific details in any way I could was my way of pursuing redemption. Menial tasks such as rewriting acquisition proposals was an example of this.  Assimilation of the methods of what made a painting so great helped take away my feelings of inadequacy. She diagnosed my over-analytical ways as a byproduct of obsessive compulsive personality disorder. I suffered more from certain symptoms than others. The trait of excessive devotion to productivity was the most noticeable.

During one of our sessions, my doctor shocked me with a proposal.

“You need to revisit the physical place,” she said. “Re-enter and make peace with it. Seeing it as nothing more than another spot is the only way you can live a full life. You will not feel so vulnerable and terrified of other places like it anymore once you are able to do this. You owe it to yourself and the memory of your friend.”

I thought I was going to fall off of the couch. I argued and pleaded. She maintained her opinion. I gave in after she reassured me she would help me prepare for the visit. She did this with a combination of hypnosis and potent anxiety medicine.

It took me a week to muster the courage, but I drove out there one evening in September.

When I saw the same orange trees and wealthy estate again, it was as though nothing had changed. No spider mites or root rots had taken down the almost forty year old evergreens. It was all untouched by the flow of time. It looked like a well-maintained portraiture plucked from my memory.

I stood on the beach in the exact same spot and looked out over the water. A few new houses were across the way, but it was otherwise identical to my remembrance. There were even some cars with young couples parked along the nearest a dirt path.

For a minute or two things were peaceful. I possessed a sense of restorative calmness. I sat down and meditated there. I read a book on my Kindle app until the sun lowered.

A black GMC Sierra truck rolled off the highway and hit an orange tree.

They all fell on the vehicle’s roof as the driver tumbled out of the driver’s side. He had a bloodied face. He spit out some of his own teeth as he collapsed.

His face squashed one of the oranges upon impact before he passed out.

I neared the accident. An empty bottle of Maker’s Mark had tumbled out with him.

I pulled out my phone to notify the police or paramedics when a woman shouted behind me. I turned around and saw a young couple who had gotten out of their vehicle.

“You slept with Rebecca?” the lady said as she raised something in her hand. Moonlight made the sterling silver glint. It was a pistol.

“No,” he said as he backed away. “Your friends are lying. That manipulative, prissy - "

Before he could finish his sentence, she squeezed the trigger. He fell with a loud scream.

I ran. A second shot rang out behind me as I fled past a couple of native sweetbay magnolia’s. The scent of swampland greeted me the further out I went. The resonance of further rounds released continued to echo from the area I escaped.

With a heaving pant, I attempted to jump over a marshy patch and landed on a stick. It rolled beneath my sneaker and caused me to fall flat on my back. I banged my head and saw stars for a few seconds.

I tried to remind myself how I had gotten quite a distance away.

I reached into my pocket to call for someone. I found out I must have dropped my device in the middle of the sprint.

I looked around. A fog settled. Red maples glowed through the murk. It was quiet. I saw someone out of the corner of my eye.

She seemed seven feet tall. Her body was translucent with billowing robes of white which adorned her figure. Her clothes seemed old and moth-bitten. Her shoes were like a ballerina’s. Around her neck was a chain with an odd symbol attached I had never seen before, almost a geometrical one. Her hair was wild, grey and black in equal measure, and it went down to her hips. It took me a while to register what I was even seeing. It was an overwhelming sight. When she graced near me her head raised and she locked onto my eyes. Her expression changed and her mouth opened wide. Her teeth were not a human’s but akin to a predator’s in the wild. She raised her arms out to either side like she wanted to engulf me and drag me somewhere. She dissipated into the ether. A shriek erupted around me, to the point where I had to cup my ears to block out the piercing wail. A scent of stagnant water became inescapable. I was so disgusted I started to run again to get away from the odor.

I found the highway after another hour of aimless wandering. For the first time in my adult life, I stuck out my thumb and hitchhiked. Someone was kind enough to pick me up, an off-duty veterinarian who had completed a long day at the office.

The driver asked one question: “Did you hear about the shooting a few miles from here?”

I stared straight ahead at the road until he dropped me off at my house.

“How was the trip to the grove?”

My therapist’s words had good intentions but were impossible for me to answer. I stared out the window of her office and refused to speak. I did bring a canvas, after I asked one of the most talented artists I knew to paint what I had seen that night.

When I lifted it to show her, she winced and looked at me with fright. This was the closest I came to being able to tell anyone about what I had been through.

When our session ended, I told her she could keep the painting. She did not understand the gesture of generosity at all. I was trying to express my emotions without speaking them aloud.

“It’s yours,” I said as I walked out. “I don’t want it.”

I did further research on the mansion near the lover’s lane. I used a mixture of genealogy websites and historical essays to find out as much as I could.

The family who owned the place had brought the witch from her home in the southwestern Europe. She served them as a medical healer. She started out as a friend of theirs. The man of the house had malicious and depraved intentions for her. She tried to get away from them in the night. At that point it was too late. She could not go back to her homeland since he kept her imprisoned in the subterranean part of the property. He forced her to cast incantations in to maintain his wealth and vanquish any competition. Her curse on the orange trees were her form of revenge in the afterlife. Although what the documents reveal is tentative at best, I knew it to be true.

Especially since I had seen as a result of those oranges falling. The hex is not fiction.

I have read that real estate development will soon destroy the grove. What will happen to those construction workers worries me.

I will never return. The emotional wound is worth preserving for the sake of survival.

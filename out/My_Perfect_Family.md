Edit: Name clarity 

Get up. Shower. Dress. Coffee. Whiskey. Breakfast with the family. The morning routine I practically do in my sleep. As I sit in the kitchen I look at my family. My son Michael hates me. My wife Susan will be out the door as soon as the money dries. My daughter Nancy and I get along, but that could just be our mutual hatred of her mother. 


Asshole. I assume that’s what most would think. But they’re also not used to hearing it from my side are they? You never listen to my side. It’s easier not to. I’m not a bad guy. Somehow the wife that sleeps around is more sympathetic than the husband with a drinking problem. Somehow my son, who insults me day in and day out, steals my money, and crashes the car about once a month, just needs more guidance. I failed them, that’s what they’ll tell you. They sit and stare at me from across the table every morning. Every fucking morning. I study the thinly veiled looks of contempt on their faces. I assume they study me back. We sit there in silence for the first part of breakfast every morning. Feeling out each other’s weaknesses. 


Susan speaks first.


“I’m going out tonight and might be gone before you get back. Don’t wait up.”


I wasn’t planning on it. 


I nod and say nothing. Michael doesn’t even bother hiding his smirk. They know what their mother is going to do. Then Michael pipes up. 


“I’m gonna go to a party at Josh’s tonight so I won’t be back either.”


He doesn’t even bother asking anymore. He just tells me. 


“Nancy are you going too?” I ask, speaking my first words of the day. 


She looks up alarmed. 


“Uh no I think I’ll stay in tonight,” she mutters. Nancy. Oh Nancy. My shining star. The only one in the house who cares about me. 


“Easy to stay in when you’re not invited,” Michael laughs. 


Nancy’s head goes further down towards her bowl. 


“Watch it,” I growl at Michael. 


He just smiles at me, begging me to do something about it. I lock eyes with him for what seems like hours before I finally break away. He and his mother get a nice snort out of this. 


I can’t even control my own son. 


With that Michael gets up from the table leaving his dishes for me as I watch him walk to his brand new Mustang and take off for school. Or wherever he goes during the day. Teachers have given up calling me because they know I can’t do anything and his mom doesn’t care. He won’t even drop Nancy off at the middle school right next to the high school. She has to ride the bus. He turns on the engine and roars out of the driveway, squealing his tires around the sharp bend out of the cul-de-sac. 


With Michael gone Susan sees no more reason to continue the charade with Nancy and I. She gets up and heads for the bedroom to get ready for her day. Her day of Netflix until she goes out with her girlfriends, most likely to end in some 20-something’s apartment. 


I watch Nancy get on the bus and head for work. Slow day, as usual. You can feel the once booming small town pharmacy I run wilt. With a CVS, Walgreens, and Wal-Mart all within spitting distance, and the older generation that was so loyal to my father dying out, there isn’t much time left.


After the regulars are through I decide to close early. There’s no one coming in after 2. The bonus is I can pick up Nancy from school. Our days out, although rare, always seem to brighten her mood. I send her a text telling her to wait for me in the usual spot and head out. 


“Hey there kiddo how was school?” I ask as she slides into the front seat.


“Ok,” she meekly replys. 


“Ok? Well ok isn’t good. I need you to be great!” I try the classic dad routine hoping to lift her spirits. 


It fails. 


I pull away from the school in silence. After a bit of driving she speaks up,


“Where are we going?”


“Well only your favorite place!” 


Her eyes widen. 


“Adventure Park!”


“You guessed it!”


Adventure Park is the run down amusement park on the outskirts of our town. It’s no Six Flags, but Nancy loves it and we haven’t made the drive out there in months. Before hopping on the freeway I realize I forgot my wallet on the dresser. I quickly turn around and race home. I want to make the most of my time with Nancy. 


As I pull in the driveway I notice an unfamiliar car in the driveway. Must be one of Susan’s new friends. That’s an encounter I was not looking forward to having. I tell Nancy to wait in the car, as I will only be a moment. I enter the living room and Susan is nowhere to be found. Figuring they must’ve taken her car I head upstairs. That’s when I hear it. Moaning. From my bedroom. That’s when I feel it. Rage. It all comes rushing back. All the times she’s come home the next morning saying she slept at a friends, all the male friends she greets so warmly in public, it fills my mind. I slowly open my bedroom door and confirm my suspicions. In my bed. In my house. 


“Get out,” I say quietly but firmly. 


They look at me and she laughs. 


“So you finally caught me. You had to have known.”


“I said get out.”


“Let me get dressed, I’m going out tonight anyway.”


“No, I mean get out. Pack your things and go.”


At this she laughs even harder. 


Nude, in my bed with a stranger, she laughs at me. 


“Ok I’ll do that.”


I can’t look at her anymore. I grab my wallet and storm out. I slam the car door as I get in, and peel out of the driveway. I nearly miss the sharp turn out of our neighborhood as I speed towards the freeway. Nancy knows something is wrong, but she knows not to ask. I force what I’ve seen to the back of my mind as we ride the coasters. 


Susan doesn’t come home until breakfast. Michael got in around 3 a.m. They’re a bit more reserved at breakfast, knowing I’m on edge. 


Michael speaks first.


“Travis is having a get together tonight…. I was wondering if I could go?”


I can barely conceal my amusement.


“Oh so you ask now?” I enquire. 


“Oh well I just thought maybe I should ask,” he says eyes down.


Today he is the one that can’t meet my gaze.


“Sure. Go out and have some fun,” I respond, much to he and Susan’s surprise. 


With that Susan speaks up.


“Um... not sure if you remember but tonight is my sorority’s reunion downtown. You wouldn’t mind if I went do you?”


I look at her with a smile.


“No of course not! You two enjoy yourselves tonight.”


They exchange cautious glances.


“But Michael you’ll need to pick your mom up from the bars tonight. Nancy and I are going out of town for the weekend, and Susan your car needs to go into the shop before we leave.”


Nancy turns to me with a huge grin on her face. 


“Enough of this Adventure Park nonsense,” I say, “we’re gonna go ride some real coasters.”


She screams with glee as she runs upstairs to pack. Once Susan’s car is dropped off at the mechanic, Nancy and I are on our way. After checking into the hotel, we spend the rest of the night riding roller coasters and attacking funnel cake. A perfect day. Around 3 a.m. my phone rings. It’s a number I don’t recognize. The officer informs me that Michael took the turn into our cul-de-sac too fast and lost control. They both died on impact. A few days later the coroner confirmed, the mix of alcohol and Michael’s reckless driving sent them into that tree case closed. Their insurance settlements came in, and I was able to retire early and spend more time with Nancy. 


Every morning leaving the house we see the reminder of the accident. The tire marks are still there, and the pavement is still scorched from the fireball that erupted on impact. Every morning I smile to myself. With the alcohol in Michael’s system and the nature of the tight turn, they never even thought to check the brake lines.

I am presently sitting at a cheap fold-out table in a featureless, windowless trailer, after having spent the last two hours being questioned by agents of a yet-to-be-disclosed agency. They said they’ll release me from their custody shortly, but that was ten or twenty minutes ago, and the few hushed words from outside I’ve heard since have led me to believe that I won’t be allowed to leave anytime soon—if ever.  

But, they’ve let me keep my phone, perhaps thinking that I’ll use it to contact someone who might have an idea of what’s going on. I’m sure they still suspect my involvement in the matter at hand, but I can assure you that I have no idea what’s happening. I haven’t the faintest clue regarding the origin of *that thing,* and the terror it’s caused.... 

There’s activity happening outside the trailer. People are shouting, though I can’t quite make out what they’re saying. Apparently, something is coming. Something fast, and *cold.* More people are screaming, now. Agents and townsfolk alike. I can hear them running, really sprinting past the trailer. No one is coming into the trailer; I don’t think anyone from town even knows I’m in here. The agents locked the trailer before departing, and I’m still too weak to even bother trying to break out.  

It's quiet, now. I heard a few faint screams off in the distance, and a few others that were strangely, worryingly cut short. There’s nothing in here with which to defend myself; nothing to barricade the door with, either. If whatever is out there wants to get it, there’s nothing I can do to stop it. I’m going to stay as quiet as I can, and in the meantime, I’ll type out my story so that people beyond town may know what’s happened here. 

\-------- 

It came careening through my front window, bouncing off the coffee table and nearly decapitating me before embedding itself in the wall. I’d been sitting there on the couch, staring off into space, mind completely blank; and then was suddenly lying sideways on the sidewalk, my body having autonomously avoided the strange missile. When the debris settled and I finally realized what had happened, I turned and stared at the object lodged into the wall behind me. It was a silverly shimmering tube of some kind, about four feet long, and practically radiant in the sunlight that shone unshaded through the broken window.  

And, strangely, a visible *front* emanated from the full length of the thing, as if it had come from some deeply arctic locale.  

There was no writing or décor of any kind on it, though the material of which it was composed did seem in some way artificially fabricated; meticulously and seamlessly applied to or shaped around the structure. I somehow knew that it wasn’t metal, even though I had no knowledge of metallurgy or any related sciences. It was just plainly obvious that the object—or rather, its outer casing—was not what you’d normally expect a missile to made of.  

Before I could examine it further and figure out how it had come to enter my house—there was no mechanism of propulsion that I could see at its rear, for example—I noticed that it was affecting my wall in a weird, *chilling* way. The misty aura of frost emanating from the projectile had transferred itself to the wall, and was spreading quite rapidly across the cracked surface. A palpable sheet of ice was forming on the white wall, had covered nearly the entirety of it in only a few moments. I heard the wall groan and shift under the pressure of the frigid armoring, and saw new cracks form beneath the translucent sheen.  

Before long, the icy casing had enveloped the full back wall of the living room, and was working its way toward the ceiling and the floor. Terrified, I leapt off the couch and backed away, rubbing my hands against the opposite arm for warmth as the ambient temperature of the room plummeted.  

Instinct told me to leave the house, to run out the front door—or jump through the blasted window—and put as much distance as I could between myself and my home. But human curiosity—or rather, stupidity—triumphed, and I remained; fleeing to the stairs for what I thought would be observational safety.  

From my slightly elevated perch, I watched, horror-stricken, as the ice quickly enveloped everything. It swelled up and over furniture, summiting their forms and cascading down in thick, blue-white sheets. Meanwhile, the bizarre object itself continued to emit the frost from its surface, filling the air with a chillness unlike anything I’d ever felt before. Knowing that my house would soon be completely overwhelmed by the frost, I climbed the stairs in a panic; hoping to recover a few personal items before the house was completely chilled.  

I had managed to collect a few important, honestly unreplaceable things, before I noticed that the ice had mounted the stairs and was approaching the top with an almost sentient hunger. Like fire spreading across an oil-smeared floor, the ice surged; leaving a chilly, twinkling slickness upon everything in its wake. I also for the first time noticed that with the boreal glazing came a soft, almost indiscernibly faint whispering. The words were virtually inaudible, but the overall effect was highly disconcerting. I sensed that they were directed at me, and pleaded for me to make contact with the ice—to give myself to it.  

I quickly ran to my bedroom, not daring to heed the cryptic calling of the cold. I figured that I’d be better off trying to survive a fall from the fifteen-or-so-foot drop from my bedroom window, than trying to survive contact with that sorcerous frost.  

With my bundle of valuables held tightly against my chest with one arm, I opened the window with the other and climbed through. Even as I passed across the sill, I felt that frigid air tickle the back of my neck; and turning around I saw an undulant wave of icy mist roll into the bedroom. Panic flared anew within my heart, and I leapt from the awning—not particularly caring if I broke one or both of my legs. I just wanted to escape that unnaturally pervasive cold.  

Fortunately, the landing was not as disastrous as I had expected. Both legs buckled upon landing, and I entered an unintentional, clumsy, but perhaps life-saving forward roll. My valuables were also protected from damage by my body, though my sides did suffer a bit of bruising from the compression. Still, I was alright, and had managed to escape being encased in a shell of preternatural ice.  

Looking up at my house, I felt a sense of guilt at letting it be totally consumed. Within, it was a pallid blue; the walls, floors, and ceiling all acrawl with the tubular object’s ceaseless emission. Without, the house appeared to sag inwardly, as if the structure was struggling to support the interior encumbrance. It looked sad, defeated, and a part of me wanted to return and try to dislodge the freezing element. But I knew that upon stepping onto the ice-glazed floor I’d be stricken with the same chilly malady; suspended forever like an insect in amber. And still, I thought I heard that unsettling whispering, unintelligibly murmurous and darkly alluring. 

The best I could do for the house was whisper an apology, and a promise to find out from where the object had come—knowing that the house probably wouldn’t be standing by the time I returned. You may think it weird, my strange affinity to—or anthropomorphization of—the house, but it had been my home for over a decade, and I hadn’t lived with anyone else. In many ways—some of them weird, I’ll admit—it had been a friend.  

I live—or rather, lived—at the end of a long, only modestly paved road, in an otherwise (locally) uninhabited region of the Midwest. There aren’t any other houses for miles, there is no “neighborhood” to speak of, and the nearest town is almost seven miles away. The isolation had caused me to grow extremely attached to the house itself, for better or worse.  

I turned and walked away, not wanting to watch the house’s structural demise. Reaching the end of the road, I turned and began my multi-mile journey to town, while my books, framed pictures, and ancestral artifacts jostled about in my arms. After a few paces there was a final, clamorous sound, the din of a great collapse, but I kept my eyes forward and quickened my stride.  

Reaching the town, I went to the Sheriff’s office and told him what had happened, and after a few moments of bewildered questioning, he decided to contact a higher tier of authority. After a few calls—and more than a few rounds of questioning—we were put in touch with someone apparently accustomed with the unreal phenomenon, and they promised to come and help us to “contain” the matter.  

About thirty minutes later, a small convoy of unmarked black vehicles—including an all-black trailer—arrived, and I was approached for questioning. The sheriff and his deputy remained at the station for their own interrogation, and the townsfolk who had gathered about the scene were quickly and efficiently dispersed by unarmed but nonetheless intimidating agents in black suits.  

And that’s it, that’s what’s happened so far. I’m still alone here in the trailer, though there have been a few noises, some of which are still ongoing and kind of sound like voices, though only whispers...faint and lulling... 

There’s something pressing against the trailer, straining its frame. I can definitely hear voices, they’re clearer, now. I can make out a few of them calling my name, beckoning me to the walls of the trailer, to the door. I’m seated at the center of it, resting against the table, but it suddenly seems so hot here. I feel like I’m burning up. The voices are saying that I need only to come to them, to press myself against the walls of the trailer, and I’ll be cooled off; I’ll be enveloped by a refreshing, revitalizing cold. I don’t see why not, it’s so dreadfully hot in here.  

I’ll post this, and then I’ll go see what the voices have to offer. This heat is unbearable.

Sorry for the radio silence these past few days. The antique store is proving a little difficult to wrap my head around, and I’ve had to play things especially safe lately. Jess wasn’t too thrilled with the mess I made last time. And she’s been hovering over me ever since. The only time I’m free from her is when she’s asleep, or the rare few times she goes on break.

That being said, I had my first encounter with a customer today. And it didn’t go great.

I was feeding Geico – the taxidermy crow – when the prod of cold, skeletal fingers on my shoulder had me stifling a scream. You see, Jess was on break. Which normally means the door is locked, the open sign is flipped, and I’m keeping well away from any and all windows. When Jess goes on break, I shouldn’t see customers, and they shouldn’t see me. That’s the unwritten rule.

“My name is *Mrs* Claire Newman,” said the customer.

She had a dignified tone, even if her voice was like an old wind’s whisper. But that wasn’t what struck me. Her stark white hair was caked in mud, and bits of twig and leaf clung to her brown splotched cardigan. She looked like she’d just rolled a mile down the hill. And, as I looked closer, I recognised her.

She was the old woman with the axe I’d seen in the woods a few days ago.

“Oh?” I tried a polite smile, “Hello, my name is Chris. How can I help you?”

“My name is *Mrs* Claire Newman.”

“Yeah, you said that,” I looked around nervously for Jess, hoping she’d be back by now.

But, when it was clear she was nowhere to be seen, I continued,  “How can I help?”

“My name… is *Mrs* Claire Newman.”

“Save with Geico!” squawked the feathery bastard I’d been trying to feed.

Claire’s eyes snapped to the bird, and then back to me. She didn’t say anything. She just glared, directly into my eyes. Her gaze was hard to meet, and I turned to look anywhere but in her direction.

“Jess should be out soon,” I tried to fill the silence, “If you’re here for-”

“The antiques?” she made a chopping motion with the axe she was holding, and it was then that I noticed she’d – somehow – pulled an axe from under her cardigan, “Yes. I’m here for the antiques, deary.”

“Well,” I wasn’t talking to Claire anymore, I was reasoning with her axe, “Jess isn’t here right now.”

“Jessica isn’t here?” her lips curled into a sneer, “Do you take me for an idiot, deary?”

There was a gleam in her eyes that felt like a fall from a skyscraper. And the way she choked that splintered axe was… unsettling.

It’d become a conscious effort to keep calm, “Give her five minutes. She’s on break.”

“But you’re not, correct?”

I’ll admit, I walked right into that one. But Jess had taught me what to do in these situations.

I let out a deep sigh, bowed my head down low and spoke in the most defeated voice my two years of high school theatre class could manage.

“I’m so, *so* sorry. But I’m still in training.”

And the melodrama seemed to work. Her eyes lowered, and her shoulders slumped. But then:

“Save with Geico!” screeched the crow, still wanting to be fed.

And Claire’s eyes were once again on Geico, and then back on me. And I was going to have serious words with that bird later.

“But you *do* have training with the antiques, don’t you?”

I tried to play it off, “Sure, with this one, I guess.”

“Then you’ll do nicely.”

I let that sit in the air for a while. Not because I’m some kind of big brain, over 9000 IQ social manipulator – I’m clearly not that – but because I was genuinely stuck on how to get out of this. At my old job, the only people I had to deal with were my boss and the rare few co-workers that hadn’t gone missing. Here, you actually had to have a level of social finesse.

“I think I’d rather wait for Jess,” was the best I could manage.

The axe twitched in Claire’s grip, her knuckles were pale.

“Well, I think I’d rather go to the counter.”

I was holding a bag of ‘Geico Snack’, and she was holding an axe.

“Ladies first?” I tried.

Her jaw clenched, her saliva frothed, and her eyes narrowed, “I don’t think so.”

A short march at axe-point later, I was standing behind the front counter. And it was… empty.

“Well?” Claire waved.

I didn’t have much to work with. I knew the antique store didn’t sell antiques, and I’d caught enough pieces of Jess’s usual spiel to know we didn’t take every antique we were offered. But aside from that, all I had to go off of was a wooden stool and the store ledger.

I opened it to the first page. Agatha May. Easy. I just had to find Claire Newman. I flipped to the next page. Agatha May. And then the next. Agatha May. I closed the book, and then opened it again. Agatha May.

Claire drummed her fingers against the butt of the axe impatiently. And I got the hint.

“You said you were Claire Newman, right?” I said, a little quieter than I would’ve liked.

“Yes. *Mrs* Claire Newman.”

I fanned through every page of the store ledger. It was all the same entry. Agatha May.

“No worries. But, just to make sure, that’s *your* name, right?”

She let out a very deep, and very annoyed sigh, “Yes. My name is *Mrs* Claire Newman.”

But the ledger’s description matched. This 87-year-old woman was Agatha May; daughter of the long-gone Janice May and long-distanced Patrick Thorn. She lived alone on the ground floor of a gated duplex. Each time she met her neighbours, they’d comment on how glad they were someone finally moved in. But she’s lived in that apartment for half a decade.

The ledger told me she was trying to pass on her axe, which was becoming more and more bothersome the more the ledger revealed. It didn’t matter that Agatha was using a fake name. It didn’t matter that her appointment wasn’t for another two years. What did matter was that Agatha May – the very same woman now intently watching for any sign I might resist – died at the base of a bridge deep in the Halmere woods two weeks ago; murdered by one Mrs Claire Newman.

The horrific details were laid out neatly in the margins of the store ledger – and I’ve removed them for the sake of you, the reader – but, suffice to say, the brown splotches on her cardigan were not part of the design, and the discolouration on the head of her axe was not rust. Agatha May was definitely, certainly, absolutely, undeniably dead. And the last line in the ledger told me I was definitely, certainly, absolutely, undeniably out of my depth.

I closed the book, “Yeah… So I need Jess for this.”

Her drumming fingers froze, and the whole world seemed to freeze with her. Colour bled from the room as I tried to interpret what the last line of the ledger meant.

“No,” Agatha chuckled, “I don’t think you do.”

The last line of the ledger was a warning. Under absolutely no circumstances should I accept anything she tries to trade.

“No. I’m pretty sure I do.”

Agatha scanned the counter from right to left and, as if she could see through it, her gaze rested on a point at the very end, and at the very bottom.

Her voice softened, “How about a trade?”

There’s a pattern I’ve discovered in the customers Jess doesn’t take antiques from. They always want a trade, and the thing they always want is what Jess keeps in the bottom draw on the far left of the front counter.

“We don’t sell antiques,” I tried to put my foot down.

But Agatha sidestepped my words, “Ah, but this isn’t a sale. It’s just an itsy, bitsy trade.”

Agatha’s cooing was somehow more disturbing than the way her hands twisted on the axe.

“Ok,” I nodded, “But you don’t have anything I want.”

She made a pathetic show of acting really conflicted over this next part.

“How about… my axe?”

My response was quick, and flat, “No thanks.”

“What? Why? Is my axe not good enough for you, Chris?”

She spat my name as if it somehow gave her power. I was unfazed.

“Sure. It’s a fine axe,” I shrugged.

“Then why-”

“But it’s also, and I’m pretty sure you know this, a murder weapon.”

I don’t know why she suddenly looked so surprised.

“Well t-that’s-”

One of the upstairs doors creaked open.

“Everything alright down there Chris?” Jess’s voice was muffled through the floorboards above us.

And the look of surprise on Agatha’s face was replaced by panic.

“We’ll be seeing each other again.”

She took a step back, and I knew we wouldn’t be seeing her again. In an instant, she was now a puddle on the floor. Something had dripped from the floorboards above, a thick tar-like ink, and melted Agatha in a single drop.

Most people would have been surprised, or at least a little shaken. I was pissed. It’d taken longer than usual, but my little *problem* had caught up with me.

Second later, Jess burst out from within the junkyard that was the store.

“What was that other voice?” asked Jess.

She registered where I was standing, and she frowned, “Wait. Why are you behind the counter?”

“We had a customer,” I said.

I watched her turn towards the closed sign on the door. I watched her eyes scan the deadbolt, still firmly slid across. I watched her look down at the Agatha puddle, squint, and then turn back to me.

“That doesn’t explain why you’re behind the counter.”

“Well,” I shrugged, “She had an axe.”

A loud, long groan of recognition escaped her lips.

“Was it,” she put on her best raspy old woman voice, “*Mrs* Claire Newman?”

“Well, that’s what she said.”

“Ok. And you didn’t take anything from her, right? We’ve lost a lot of people to-”

“No. I didn’t.”

“Cool. Easy. Then which way did she go?”

I nodded towards the slowly growing puddle on the floor.

“Oh shit. You killed-”

“I didn’t do shit,” I half-truthed, “Some of this, whatever the hell, got on her and she wicked witched herself.”

Jess raised an eyebrow, “She what?”

“You know, she melted.”

Her eyebrow didn’t lower, “I’ve never heard that phrase before.”

“Does that really matter right now?”

She crossed her arms and considered it, and then let up, “I suppose you’re right. So, what’s with the… oil?”

“Wait. You don’t know what that is?”

She shook her head, and I thanked the flats for their infinite mercy.

“I’ve actually never seen this before,” her frown broke into a smile, “You’re two-for-two today dude.”

We followed the dripping upstairs to find a second drip, coming from the attic hatch at the end of the hallway. And that’s where Jess called it for the day.

“I’m not going up there,” she crossed her arms.

I thought about the dripping, and the puddle of Agatha I still hadn’t mopped. I thought about what I knew the drip came from, and what would happen if Jess figured out my secret.

“Well, I’m not either,” I replied.

“So we’re agreed?”

“Agreed on what?”

“Ignoring it.”

My thoughts once again drifted to what I’d have to do if this got any worse.

“You mean… you just want to leave it like this?”

She crossed her arms, “Ok, I’m hearing what you’re saying.”

I waited, and when she didn’t continue, I spoke.

“And?”

She nodded, “I’ll bring a couple of buckets.”

She didn’t move. She just stood there. Nodding. The attic hatch continued to drip, and each drop was a thwack on the floorboards. Each drip was a tick on a clock counting down my stay in the store.

“Now?” I asked.

“Yeah, I’m on it.”

Again, she didn’t move. And I’m sure you can understand my confusion, because I was looking right at her, and she wasn’t moving. I think she noticed my gaze burning holes into her skull, because she rolled her eyes.

“Come with me,” she sighed.

She walked backwards down the hall. I followed. She walked backwards down the stairs. I followed. She walked backwards through the mounds of junk until we both stood at the front counter.

“See anything outside?” she asked, facing away from the window.

Now, don’t get me wrong, Jess was a weird one. But this was getting absurd.

“You want me to look out the window for you?” I asked.

“Yes.”

“Is there a reason you can’t do it yourself?”

“Kind of.”

It was my turn to sigh, “Cool, no worries.”

I hesitate to say something felt wrong outside. Mainly because it feels wrong to describe the absence of the ever-present, ever-hunting things outside as unsettling. But that’s what it was. Unsettling. There were no customers. And there were none of those creatures that lurk at the white pebble border at the edge of the clearing.

“Jess, what’s going on?”

She didn’t speak. She just shook her head. I looked back out the window. In all the stillness there was suddenly movement. Someone was walking, weaving between the pines. But their movements was weird, they were… backwards.

“Uh… Jess?”

I turned to look at my co-worker, but something was wrong. Jess wasn’t next to me. She was outside. She was the person walking backwards in the woods.

“Who the hell are you?” I asked the thing next to me.

I think it shook its head, though I can’t be sure. The thing was blurry. The details are fog in my mind. But it didn’t feel dangerous at the time. The blur of this creature was comforting, somehow. Which was the complete opposite of Jess right now. The closer she got to the store, the less I was sure it was her. The closer she got to the store, still walking backwards, the more she blurred like the thing standing next to me.

“Jess?”

The thing next to me nodded. The thing outside stood at the door, back still turned to me. At this point I wasn’t sure of anything. Either of them could have been Jess. Neither of them could have been Jess. Maybe there was no Jess. Maybe they’re Maybelline?

But there was a clatter as two metal buckets hit the deck outside, and then the outside figure walked away, back still turned to us. Down the steps. Out the clearing. And, as it vanished deep into the pines, I was sure of it. The thing outside was Jess. And she’d left me here.

“Alright, go grab those buckets and let’s go ignore ourselves a drip,” Jess said from next to me.

Hold on. Jess was standing next to me?

“Uh no? You’re going to explain exactly what the hell that was,” I told her.

Jess turned to me, and shrugged, “How would I know, dude?”

Guys. What the hell *is* my co-worker?

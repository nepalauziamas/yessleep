Hello, my name is Nolla Peirce, and I am in jail for the murder of my family, but I am innocent. No, I am not crazy. Some monster has killed my family.

&#x200B;

I live in a small town in New Mexico, USA, called Bernalillo. It is a beautiful little town. I was there with my daughter Sammy 14-years-old and, my son Ahiga 5-year-old, and my husband, Jayce, who is Native American. I am a Spanish European with a catholic background. We lived there for six years peacefully until just these past several months in November of 2021 is when it all started, the death, the depression, and the crawling…  Within the attic, always at 4:am, was something large crawling above mine and my husband's room, sometimes above my daughter's room. It would scare her so bad she would sleep in our bed. 

&#x200B;

It had just started after my mother-in-law passed, and we had put down three family dogs due to horrible health issues, so everyone was sad, even my son, who was such a happy boy. 

&#x200B;

This thing seemed to favour my daughter, the one I'm most protective over due to her age, and she is a young woman, exactly what they want she is young and naive, my poor baby, I'm so sorry…

&#x200B;

Then the crawling got too bad; my husband put large animal traps in the attic. We thought it may have been a racoon or some animal, but we had never caught anything except one thing- a medium-sized bone with distinctive bite marks, almost like a shark bite, but in New Mexico? In an attic?? It had made no sense no animal who could get into my attic could do that. 

&#x200B;

After that, it had worsened, almost as if this thing knew we had known it was there now. I feel like it was trying to taunt us. It would go into the walls late at night and knock on wood for hours, not doing anything else, just knocking all night till the sun began to rise, then silence. 

&#x200B;

Our house was so scary my husband's parents would be too scared to even step on our property, saying it was cursed and that if we were to move, it would follow us now that it had "claimed us as its prey," and I trusted them, but there was no one who could help this was a creature, not a demon. 

&#x200B;

And so we left it. We planned on calling some family to come so we could have a ceremony to cleanse our home, but it was already too late. So that night, after we had called around to our parents and siblings, we had put the kids down for bed and got in bed ourselves. We had to have been in bed for an hour or so, my husband got up to get a drink, and after a few minutes, I heard a high-pitched scream.

 

Both me and Jayce ran into the room we had heard the scream. My daughter's room was so pretty and pink except for the blood… All of it leads up to my daughter, whose head was eaten by this monster. But she was still alive, just whimpering for me to help her, but what was I supposed to do…

&#x200B;

I left to call 911 as my husband watched his baby girl. As I called 911, I checked my son's room, and he was safe sleeping in his bed with the little bear his daddy had bought him. As I spoke with the 911 operator, Jayce screamed as it attacked him, biting him in the throat. It was ripping it open. 

My daughter and husband were gone, stolen away from me in mere seconds. And so I grabbed Ahgia and ran out of the house into my neighbour's house, who called the cops moments before I ran in. 

&#x200B;

When the cops and paramedics came, I was bawling. I knew they wouldn't believe me, not even if they saw it. So they arrested me and gave my son to my parents until further notice, so here we are. 

&#x200B;

This story is no product of drugs like acid or LSD nor caused by any medications I've taken. Additionally, I do not have postpartum depression, nor do I have Schizophrenia.

 I, Nolla Peirce, am innocent of the murder of my husband Jayce Peirce and my daughter Samantha Perice.

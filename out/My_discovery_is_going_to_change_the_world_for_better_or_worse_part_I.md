The fungoid mass had consumed it almost completely. 


Ravenous decay had turned it into another black mound among similar mounds on the forest floor.


Squirrels, rabbits, rats, didn’t matter once that fungus got it.


I pulled on my glove and removed squishy, my latest experiment, from the bag in my hand.


He had died before he could express any of the genes I had altered for him.


Better here than anywhere else.


I turned the bag over.


The frog's body landed limblessly into the mass, sinking down, clear fluid rising around it from inside. 


Now that I'd been feeding them, the mounds had started multiplying. Where there were two the week before, there were ten now.


I had discovered the fungus that made up the mounds six months previous.


When I approached I saw that it was a dead thing being consumed by the fungi.


On the ground,  around the decaying creature, were little white things. 


Maggots, that's normal where an animal had died. But that's the thing. They were dead too. 


I grabbed one and brought it back to my lab that day. That was when I made my discovery.


A landmark of scientific progress. I could name my price once they found out what it could do.



Back at home, I stopped in the kitchen, washed my hands, and made a peanut butter and strawberry jam sandwich.


Then I made my way into the basement, keyed in the six digit code, entered and then locked the door. 


I'd installed three floor to ceiling plexiglass windows forming a box down there. My version of an air lock.


The plexiglass door cut into the window on my right led to my bedroom. 


Practical, dark green cot, pendleton blanket for cold nights and my work from home setup. No space wasted.


I worked nights at a call center and it paid the few bills I had since I never used the rest of the house except to cook.


The door in front of me led to my lab. The lights were in dim mode, only the countertops were lit with a long panel of leds under the cabinets.


I stripped down to nothing, throwing my clothes in a pile by the basement door. Then I gowned up, goggles, booties, gloves the whole thing. This was as close to a clean room as I was going to get on my budget.


The moment I entered the chattering and banging of cage doors began.


"I know, I know, you're hungry." I said, opening a cabinet and pulling out a big bag of meal worms, and another bag of pellets.


The crinkling of the bag set my little pets to shrieking. 


"Jeez, I'm coming." I flipped the light switch, illuminating the lab and the two little cages on the corner.


These were some of my experiments, the living ones.


Jeeves was running back and forth. He was a white rat, norvegicus domestica. I opened his cage, put a handful of pellets in his trough. 


He waddled over, the rigid folds of gray skin that now grew in a vertical line from his chest to his belly, getting caught in his legs.


The gill experiment appeared to have failed. The structure was there but they were nonfunctional.


I scratched jeeves on his back and his little leg kicked up in time with my scratches.


Gerty was chirping like mad by this point. 


I opened her cage. 


She was a run of the mill yellow chick. I'd grown her from an egg. She had had the engineering treatment while still an embryo so her results were quite… severe. 


I had just started my own experiments at that time and I had been a little ambitious with my edits.


She would be a lifelong occupant of my lab however. Being my first successful experiment. 


I poured her food. She drug herself to the food, her tumescent body quivering. 

She had two beaks fused together in the middle. No legs to speak of and most of her feathers were gone. She was a beautiful, pulsing, blue and red thing now. The power of the fungi and a little gene editing.


She leaned the side of her head over the bowl and got a mouthful of pellets.


I patted her and left her cage open so she could roam the enclosure.


My lab consisted of two epoxy countertops set in by me, lower and upper cabinets, hung by me, an island with more epoxy countertop with sink, and a single propane burner. I had A tiny vent hood where I could experiment with more dangerous subjects. This connected to my very complicated, professional venting system. 


Which consisted of a long dryer tube ran to the upper basement window and duct taped there. The blower was pretty powerful though, during my validation process I used a fog machine to fill the whole lab with a thick layer of fog. The vent was able to remove it all in under a minute. 


The construction was the cheapest part, the expense came from the large microscope in the corner, the hood vent, autoclave for cleaning, the fridge. 


Not to mention the massive cost to keep everything stocked.


Oh and the incubator.


I walked over to look at my creation, currently being heated inside the dome of the incubator.

A lump of red flesh in a bed of liquid to keep it moisturized. I opened the incubator and put a few drops of nutrient fluid into its dish and it wriggled as it absorbed it.


My most interesting creation. 


My other experiments were made with existing lifeforms. Already structured.


Project Organoid was going to something new altogether. I had no idea what it would shape up to be, I just started with a few embryonic stem cells that had been engineered to be brain cells. 


Along with my secret ingredient of course. The only thing making this fiction possible. 


The fungus.



That day when I had found the maggot in the forest, I had immediately brought it back to my lab.


I grabbed a slide from the drawer below the microscope and produced the maggot I'd found earlier, then stuck it to the slide


Then it went into the scope.


I could clearly see its face, little fangs and two black spots, a translucent line that started at the mouth and ended in a black nodule at the ass of the thing.


In the middle of the digestive tube sat a dark mass, something it must've been trying to digest. 


I zoomed in further and got out a scalpel and my tweezers, carefully removing the digestive tract and excising the mass.


I set the slide with the maggot aside and made a new one for this half digested thing. 


Under the microscope it looked like simple rotting flesh but something else was there.


I upped the magnification. 


There it was, undeniably some other material on the flesh itself. Polyps of some kind, layered atop each other. I remembered what fungi looked like back in my microbio classes. This was fungi.


I magnified more.


I studied it a bit. Taking some photos at different angles.


I couldn't identify the fungi with Google so I zoomed more looking for more characteristics.


That was when I saw what had killed the maggots.


In the fungi were silver-purple veins, they ran through each cell. 


I zoomed until I could see the texture. The fungi was decidedly fungi-like. But those veins. The veins were flaky on the surface, like those mud flats in death valley, or more like, bismuth seen under a microscope.


I don't think I have to say this, but there is no fungi on earth like this.


It had some kind of stone or metal infused into its very cell walls.



That was six months ago. The day things started to circle the drain was Thursday, Grocery day… 


I’d spent the majority of the morning clearing out old experiments and taking the trash up to the cans outside.


Gerty was sad to have lost her companion but I needed the space.


I would have done grocery delivery but nobody comes out this far. 


So instead,  I had to drag myself the 40 miles or so to the closest store.


Getting groceries isn't so bad, it's the environment.


The stinging white of the fluorescents, the cold, sterile air, and worse, the cloying presence of all those people.


Just pushing that cart around makes me one of them and that I can't stand. Yet, I need food.


So I putter around with my milk, my eggs, my body wash. 


The lives these people lead. Like hamsters.


They have little hamster houses that all look the same. Little hamster toys, little hamster cars.


They go to their little hamster wheel jobs, and eat pellets from their favorite hamster bowl. 


Sometimes they fuck and bring about more hamster people. 


They raise their hamster kids and get old, they die in their little cages. Having never realized the cyclical, oppressed, hellscape they lived in. They doom others to meaninglessness by their culture. 


Culture dictates you live like a hamster. Yearn for that hamster wheel job, and that hamster cage house that they can maybe afford one day.  Yearn for that hamster family, and that day you die in your personal hamster cage. 


Then they chuck your hamster body into a hamster hole and put your cage up for sale so another hamster can do the same thing. 


They don't even see it, worse, they're happy with it. Most people don't read more than the bold text on their snapchat timelines.


I refuse to be that. A fucking hamster. I disavow the culture that leads to that. 


When I grab a can of tomato sauce from the shelf and look over to see some trendy dressed hamster catch my eye a moment I want to throw that can football style straight into her face.


Nevermind that.


When I see some shithead kid with his family grabbing Lunch-Able from the freezer, I want to scream at them. "Look, don't you see what you're doing. Don't you see that you're just hamsters in cages. Don't you see you're dooming your children to lives of useless monotony?"


I don't do any of that. I'm not crazy. So I grimace at the girl, I pass the family and sigh. I grab my shit and go because to stay here, or enjoy this ritual is to accept that I'm one of them.


I pay for my groceries and then take myself out for one of the few pleasures my minimal income allows me. Ice cream. 


Then I head to the university. It's been awhile, but I need a hand.



Professor Nestell stares at me from his seated position at the big executive desk in his office.


I wait a beat, letting my presence sink in.


“Can we chat?” I asked.


He just looked at me.


"I came to apologize." I say, that's what he wants so I say it.


"Well that doesn't quite do it now does it." He says. "You were lucky not to be expelled. Lucky that my standing with Blackstone means something to the dean." He stood up, sighed. 


"I'm aware of the hardships my actions put your department through." I said, "If I could take it back right now. I would. Instead she takes a third of my check every month."


"And I'm aware of the settlement." He said, looking out his window with his hands behind his back.


I was a little thrown off. 


“How?” I asked, stifling bile at my privacy being invaded.


He put a hand up.


“This happened at the university, we keep tabs on the outcomes of such court cases.” He said. “It's in the interest of our donors.”


“Well…” I said.


Professor Nestell grabbed a paper from his desk drawer and laid it face down on his desk. Then he stood up.


“What brings you here?” He asked.


“I can’t just come visit my favorite professor?” I asked.


He exhaled through his nose and narrowed his eyes. This was as close to laughter as the professor ever got.


“Andrew, It's been fourteen months since your voluntary withdrawal from classes.” He said, looking out the big window in his office. “I assume it's more than a personal call. I assume you’re working on something.”


He turned back to me and approached the desk again.


“I hope you aren’t wasting my time with a personal visit, is really what I mean.” He said.

I smirked. He raised his eyebrow.


Then I set the sample on his desk. 


A little speck of black and purple in a tiny vial.


He sneered down at it.


“Is this what you’re bringing to me?” He asked.


“I found it in the forest, I think it's…” I was cut off.


“Don’t burden me with useless details. You can’t afford a microscope? Surely you aren’t asking me to use my resources for that.” He said.


“No, I’ve got a fully stocked lab, and a compound scope of my own. I’ve been performing a study on this fungi for the last six months. If I needed a microscope, I would have stolen one before I would have brought something so trivial before you.” I said.


He exhaled again. He wasn’t so hard to figure out, he just wanted his ego stroked before he would help.


“You know what this is?” He asked, pointing at the paper he’d pulled out.


I’d forgotten it was there in the midst of our negotiations.


“No…” I said, I didn’t know where he was going with this.


“No?” He said.


“No.” I insisted.


He opened up the paper.


He cleared his throat.


“Dear Dr. Hardwick, I am writing to recommend one of my exceptional students to your program. Andrew ************  has proven unprecedented ability in the realm of Gene Manipulation. Not just that, he has a quality most other people do not. Discretion…” He trailed off and set the paper down.


I stood there. I’d known about this letter already. I’d been through every drawer in that office a thousand times while he was teaching other classes. 


“I will do this favor for you. Whatever it is. But only this one. I want you re-enrolled in classes as soon as your suspension expires. That is Autumn next year. You understand?” He said.


“Yes.” I said.


“Now, what do you have for me?” He asked.



Professor Nestell's eyes narrowed, his hawk nose crinkled at the sides as he pulled away from his microscope.


"That's not…" He said. But he couldn't finish. 


I was barely concealing my smile.


Other students had scoffed when they saw us talking in private after every class. But I didn't care about them. They weren't made for greatness so they could not recognize it. They were made for the hamster mill that keeps this country running.


In Nestell, I found a person I could respect for the first time in my life.


Science was his first priority. All other motives were null. Your grade on the final was too low, you didn't study, no exceptions, no curve.


"I said the same thing." I said.


"This is something. Really something." He said.


"I was thinking we should send it off to the geologic society. I want to know what that metal is." I said.


"Yes, I think so." He said, looking at the slide again. "The maggots were all dead, you're sure of that?"


"Yes." I said.


"Okay, I'm going to examine this in more detail. I'll call you when we get results from Frank." He said, referring to the head of the geologic society.


I nodded and left.



I was excited that Professor Nestell wanted me back. I really thought he’d written me off.


I was really hard on myself after I’d hurt that girl. Hurt is a strong term I think but I don’t make the rules.


Up to that point I'd been untouchable.


Disappointment, loss, even doubt passed over me in waves. 


“No.” I thought, pushing those feelings out of my head.


I took a breath, closed my eyes.


I had lost the opportunity to work for Dr. Hardwick. He ran a prestigious, very secretive gene lab that did high level gene research and I was a shoe in. 


But now…


Now I was on the verge of shifting the industry forever.


I had nothing to worry about.


I’ve mentioned the fungus but I may not have said what it does exactly. I’ll try to explain it in layman's terms as much as possible. It's very complicated stuff.


Okay, so:


Most of the time when you do genetic experiments you can only make minor changes. You can’t add wings to a puppy, say. 


It's too complex, structures need to be built, bones, cartilage. It's too much.


That’s where the fungus comes in. It basically acts like a structural material. A good biohacker can differentiate these cells, this means to tell the cell what type of cell you want it to be. Blood cell, bone cell, muscle cell. The fungus will then grow according to a blueprint.


This allows the creation of extra-biological structures. 


The wings on the puppy are now possible as long as the biohacker has made their blueprint correctly. 


Otherwise, you get some less than stellar results. See FIG.1 (Jeeves the Gilled Rat).


I don’t know much about the background of the fungus. It just appeared one day. This was a couple of weeks after a barely noticeable meteor shower. Those mounds of fungus began growing wherever animals died in the forest. Consuming them and then disappearing back into the ground.


It wasn’t until the maggots that I became interested in it. Thank god or whoever that I did.


The research I had done led to basically no findings. No fungus had ever been discovered with metal growing through it. 


There was a snail on some volcanic vents that had evolved iron into its shell to help it survive extreme temperatures. So it wasn’t fully unheard of.


I’d found a related topic in a secretive bioengineering community on an online forum. (I can’t name them or the forum they use for legal purposes.). Dr. Latham’s findings in venezuela. 


These were published on a dark website, only accessible if you have the link. All other sources had been scrubbed by the unnamed university that had exiled him.


Another story of a scientist held back by a staff of small minded architects of mediocrity.


He had discovered something out in the jungles on a routine biology expedition. Something strange, a type of stone that had certain properties.


Not quite radioactive but according to the studies it had reactions with DNA and RNA. The types of reactions and his findings are lost to time.


He stopped expeditions and got funding for a research facility. He insisted it be in Venezuela as well, likely for privacy since the Americans did not have a stomach for his kind of research.


He’d been pulling subjects from local villages to participate in his studies and yes, many died. 


But don’t let that make you think he was being unethical. Every victim of Latham’s experiments had agreed willingly to participate. They’d been warned of the risks but their devotion to Dr. Latham was strong. 


He’d ingratiated himself with those communities. Offering them aid, food, clean water, vaccinations, education. They were more than happy to participate.


Yet, small minded people labeled him a cult leader, unethical, manipulative. 


Imagine the good that could have come of his findings. Instead, it was all buried, nobody benefitted. 



I got home from the university later that night. I took my groceries in and headed downstairs. I was hit by a smell even before I got into the lab.


I burst in and looked at Gerty. She was fine, just clucking away pulling on the little toy that hung in her cage.


Then I checked the incubator. 


It was dead. The little red thing was gray, it had enlarged and overtook its dish, like it had metastasized. When I’d left it was as big as a peach, now it had grown twice that size. It lay still in the dish. 


It had started out a mass of living brain cells, clumped together with the fungi. Making organoids was a new field that I wanted to get started in. It was kind of a messy experiment that I hadn’t imagined would work. I was sad regardless. 


It had almost gotten to the point where I could have started other experiments. Biological computing was the goal I had come up with. But now I’d have to start over. Two months of research down the drain.


I tried a few things to save it, steroids, more food, but it ultimately ended up in the trash can, along with the few bottles of food I had made up for it.


I grabbed a bottle of wine and drank myself to sleep that night.



I tossed and turned, hearing strange sounds from outside my room. Just enough to slightly rouse me, but I would fall back into fitful sleep.


Finally, I woke up in a sweat. 


I sat up in my cot getting my bearings. 


I looked at my phone. 4:36 am.


The room was pitch black except for the minimal light that leaked through the plexiglass from the lab.


I was used to this light, the underlights from the cabinets cast a small shaft of yellow light onto the floor next to my cot. 


But at that moment, the light was cut down the middle. Some jagged shadow separated it.


I racked my brain,  trying to think of some object that could be projecting that shadow. But I knew, with ice cold surety, that it wasn't that.


Anything could be outside that door. An intruder, but how did they get in? They could get in the house but not the lab. 


Something else then. I pushed out the primordial thoughts that tried to invade my mind.  


Those thoughts that cavemen must have had when they looked out beyond the borders of their fires.  Into the infinite plain of moonless night. Where anything could be. Fanged, clawed, dripping with the blood of your brethren that had ventured too far.


The hair on my neck stood at attention. My breathing slowed. My heels itched to push against the Concrete floor. To stand me up and run me out of there.


And that's when it breathed. The jagged shadow expanded a moment then returned to normal size.

My attention snapped to the window itself.


My eyes were adjusting to the light, I could see something, misshapen stuck to that window. Only an eighth inch of plexiglass separated me from the horror on the other side.


I gasped, I didn't choose to, my body just did it. A loud, shuddering gasp, the gasp of a man facing his death, with the knife in his chest, just before it strikes his heart.


The shape scuttled up the window like a horseshoe crab. Now it was at the top of the window partially illuminated by the light.


There was a sucking sound as it attached itself onto the glass.


It was only about a foot in diameter, circular in shapes with ragged edges that expanded and contracted, shuddering as it did.


I screamed. I jumped out of my bed and knocked over my night stand pushing myself into the corner of the room. My hands gripped the walls like I was going to climb out of there. 


My mind would not let me accept what I saw. I was still asleep, it insisted, sleep paralysis or something.


Something banged on the plexiglass, like hitting it with a stick. 


Some stubby, knot ended, bone appendage had sprouted from its side and was now thumping the window like a door knocker.


Something fleshy and bulbous hung from its side, half absorbed into the thing. 


When I saw feathers hanging from its side I knew it was Gerty. I did not think I would hurt, seeing her like that. I kept her for standard scientific reasons. 


Still, seeing her dead there shot sadness through me. 


“No Imagine.” Something said in some recess of my mind. 


The voice seemed to come straight from my amygdala. Every syllable jolted my nerves, making my body shiver.


I screamed and put my hands over my eyes. I don't like to admit this, but I believe in facts. I lost control of all bodily functions as I slid down the wall into a puddle on the floor.


"Hunger… Me… Hunger. Me." It said, making my back arch as the words shot through me.


I was bawling at this point, snot running down my face, to pool onto my chin.


I said nothing.


"Hung–er" it said again.


"What?" I cried out from the floor.


"HUNGER ME!!!" It screeched.


Then a series of images flashed through my head. Squirrels, rabbits, rats, mice, dogs, cats.  But they weren't just any animals, they were all animals I'd seen before. Animals removed from my own memory banks.


"Now." It said. 


I did not move.


"NOW!!!" It screeched.


The words stood me up. Fresh waves of cold shooting through my body. I stood there. 


The thing tapped on the plexiglass. A slow, tap, tap, tap.


It was waiting for me to open the door.


I put my hand on the panel. The thing made squishing sounds as it waited.


I hesitated at the door.


"Now!" It said again and my hand grabbed the knob without my consent.


I knew it wasn't going to let me leave, worse, if I didn't bring it to food it would use that bony appendage on me. 


I imagined myself on the floor being absorbed by the thing. Lost in agony, Like Gerty.


I closed the door, now I was feet away from it. 


Its glistening backside made a dome segmented by continents of dark skin with rivers of gelatinous mass in between. 


It stunk too, like burning tires and decaying food in the sink.


I opened the door that led up the stairs to the house.


"There, you can go." I said to it.


It slammed that bone into the plexiglass again.


"NO!" It said, "WEAK… take…"

 

I realized my hand was shaking, my heart slammed against my sternum.


I would wake up soon, I knew it. This wasn't really happening. Maybe there was a gas leak and this was my final moments playing out in a hallucination.


"No dream, no pethugayu." It said,  I still have no idea what that last word meant. 


"Take…" It said, crawling down the wall to arm level. 


It wanted me to carry it. Now fucking way was all I could think. 


I looked up the stairs and realized, I can just slam the door and run. Just get the fuck out and never come back. 


Just as that thought went through my mind something else did too.


Something tore a ragged hole into my brain, seizing me, holding me still.


The "hand" had ahold of me somehow like it had grasped my limbic system and kept me still.


It could feel me, and I could feel it.


It was tired, very tired. Close to exhaustion. 


Visions of my death passed before my eyes. It showed me what it could do with me, even in that state. It would feed on me for several days, become stronger and find its way out of here. 


It let me go. The hand releasing and exiting through the tear in my head.


"Now!" It said, dropping down the wall and reaching out to grab onto my hand.


I grabbed it, I shuddered as many fingerlike projections on its bottom helped it crawl up my arm to shoulder.


Then we went outside. 


My body buzzed, some kind of vibration had started in my chest with every step. I was swimming through the dark.


It strained and a hole opened on the side of it. Something new slid out, A black, malformed double beak that met in the middle. Gerty’s beak, but it was made out of that black skin that covered the thing.


I fell to my knees and vomited. My body did not want to hold my weight anymore.


“UP.” The creature said, shocking me to my feet. 


The jolt kept me afloat but I was fading fast.


The thing was loosening its grip as well. It was using energy to affect me as well and it was about to run out of gas.


Then a skunk came running out of a bush. 


The monster lept from my hand onto the skunk. There was a scream and then a choking sound as the creature pushed its gelatin body into the skunks throat.


I fell to the ground. 


Through blurred vision I saw the creature enveloping the struggling skunk.


“I could run now. Its distracted.” I remember thinking before sinking into the black.


“I could run now.”

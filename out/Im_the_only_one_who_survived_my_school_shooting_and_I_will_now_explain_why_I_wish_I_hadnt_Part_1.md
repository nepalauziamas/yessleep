Although I’d rather not start the tale of my past with this part, I have decided tell all of you about who I was before this incident so that you will be able to trust me, however much that may be, and understand why the things that happened…happened.

Maybe you’ll even believe what I am about to tell you…but I do not find myself feeling hopeful of that.

Trust cannot exist without trust.

What my English teacher, Mrs. Hedge, meant with this statement, is that for someone to trust you, you yourself must trust them first.

You have to expose yourself – to reveal something personal that shows the other party that you trust them enough to make them privy of something from deep within yourself.

So...to say that I was a less than desirable child would be an understatement. In fact, I was the textbook definition of a bad kid.

Shit grades, no friends, dark clothes, bad temper, smoking more weed than I breathed air, and viewing my life as something I would drift through like an invisible specter – there, but not really.

All through high school, I felt like a plastic bag floating through the depths of the ocean.

Mrs. Hedge, who I mentioned earlier, was my Sophomore English teacher, and was the only one who kept me from hitting the bottom and laying there like a fossil.

Well, her and my best friend Tony.

They were the closest thing to family that I have ever had. I met Tony back in third grade, a blessed time when no orders of social construct existed, and everyone just played with each other equally. As time went by, and I started to transmutate into the degenerate that was high school me, Tony never left my side. He stuck by me no matter what, always willing to listen to whatever I had to say, no matter how much weed my words were soaked in. His smile never left his face, and everything would always seem a little less bad whenever we talked. Tony was the brother I never had, the person who I could tell anything and everything to without the fear of being judged.

As time passed, our conversations became more of a one-sided interrogation. I would always end the topic of discussion – whatever it might be – by asking him why the hell he still stayed by my side. His grades, his status, his opportunities, and so on were all top notch after all. He had nothing to gain by being with me, but he would always shake his head and smile, saying that he just didn’t care and loved spending time with me.

It was only because of Mrs. Hedge that English was the only subject I didn’t fail. She was sensitive to my needs, and seemed to have an understanding of me that even I didn’t have. Her class was always open to me, and she would always excuse me from studying as long as I would read a book that she would give me.

I stayed out of trouble for the most part, and because of Tony and Mrs. Hedge, I never truly did hit rock bottom, although I admit I did come pretty damn close.

But alas, what slowly comes up, must inevitably come crashing down.

Everyone in school hated me, even though I didn’t do jack shit to them, unlike some of the other assholes that roamed those damn halls.

My sophomore year ended abruptly with a sour note on January, right at the start of the second semester, when my fist connected with the jaw of a kid who’d insulted Tony and Mrs. Hedge. I was the type of person that you could poke and prod with whatever you wanted, be it words or a stick, but I’d never fight back.

That time was different.

That time, it wasn’t me they had insulted.

They had insulted people who didn’t deserve a single syllable of what had been said about them.

I could take whatever they could throw at me, because in my mind, I deserved it.

But I didn’t that day, because those who had been insulted didn’t deserve it.

Needless to say, Junior year started without me, despite the efforts of Tony and Mrs. Hedge.

Their support might have been infinite, but they were no match for the bastards that ran that place.

It wasn’t so bad, if I’m being honest.

Being stuck home all day, that is.

More time for my weed.

More time for my shows.

More time for my thoughts.

Not to mention more time for jobs (although I never really did commit myself to that one quite like I did to the others).

See? Honesty.

Another thing that I learned during this time while alone is that the old saying my grandfather would always tell me really was true.

The devil always comes at night.

I can tell you from first-hand experience that he stands at the foot of your bed, and tells you all that you don’t want to hear.

But you do.

Because it’s true.

It’s because it is true that it is so horrible.

Every night he would come and say them to me.

My faults.

The words would gush out of his obscured mouth and did so till the first rays of light pierced through my dirty curtains.

Only then would he leave...but he would be there the next night.

He was a distant memory when the sun sat in the sky, but when it was a hidden, he was but an all too real reminder of what I was.

That was me.

I’m not ashamed to admit it.

Because…it’s the truth, as *he* would always say.

And I agree with that.

But after a certain day…his stories changed.

He no longer chastises me.

Instead, every night, while I sink through the boundary that separates reality from dreams, he takes that brief moment, when I take my last conscious breath, to remind me why the inside of my skull roil, boil, and churn with nightmares while I sleep.

He whispers it right before I become fully submerged in the more viscous world of dreams, and as the air of consciousness escapes from my mouth and floats up to the surface where it belongs, his words are all that stay, weighing me down and ensuring that I sink down to where no light can reach.

I no longer have peace.

All because of what happened.

The living nightmare that started on that one faithful day.

…

I cannot say with any degree of certainty which day it was. They all blended together back then, like plaques of clear glass laid on top of one-another.

That was my life, and to some extent, continues to be my life.

That bubble I used to live in burst one day.

Popped by the sound of my cellphone ringing, my monotonous routine forever shattered by the voice that spoke to me on that day while I lay barely lucid on my red grimy couch, a half-eaten pizza near me and my bong resting on my chest.

“H…hello?” I barely managed.

Nothing.

I was about to put my phone down.

I really was.

But then words escaped the little object in my hand before I had a chance to do so.

“B-B-Ben?” The voice on the other end stuttered, even less decipherable than my mumbles. It sounded like a set of teeth were clattering madly, chewing the words of the person on the other end and making sure that they came out as unintelligible and garbled vomit.

“T-Tony?”

I stood up, the bong sliding off and tumbling to the moldy floor.

I could hear his heavy breathing on the other side, and I felt myself go sober in a heartbeat.

I heard everything.

I swear.

I heard his voice refracting off of the walls of wherever he was, and bouncing back into the receiver. My hearing was so focused that I could actually hear the tiny microphone of my phone working, struggling to decipher the electrical signals flowing through it like a mule barely able to drag along a heavy cart.

“Tony, where are you?”

My heart pounded as if I was having a bad high.

“Oh…god,” he said, “they’re not coming…I call and call but they just tell me to stop calling. They just threaten me with arrest if I and everyone else don’t stop prank calling them!”

“Who?”

“The p-police damn it!”

“What?”

“Damn it Ben…”

Tony was almost in hysterics.

“Fuck…It happened so quick. An officer had come to school to warn us about the god damn prank calls, and right in the middle of the speech, from behind the curtain of the auditorium, there was a flash of light and the bastard-the ba-the bastard’s face splattered on the ground like a fucking mop”

By now, it sounded like he was trying to talk while restraining the uncontrollable heaves of his throat.

“Th-t-then,” he continued, “someone stepped onto the fucking stage f-from behind the c-c-curtains and….and….”

I said nothing.

My mind was skimming over what I had heard so far, trying desperately to authenticate it, making sure that I wasn’t mishearing every single word.

When it told me that I was really hearing what I was hearing, my breathing quickened, and then stiffened, and then softened, so that if felt like my throat was a soft sponge, expanding and putting pressure on the inside of my neck with every breath.

“Where are you?” I asked.

A painful moment of silence ensued.

“The…the bathroom….i-in a stall” was the reply.

My heart dropped.

“Listen,” I said, suddenly very focused and trying to whisper, “you’re not safe there! Get in the ceiling. It shouldn’t be too hard. Just move one of those board, get in there, and stay put until help arrives. I’m coming there myself.”

He was going to reply.

I knew he would.

He would tell me to not come, but he never did.

Instead, I only heard the sound of the stall door opening, and before I knew it, I was out of my house with the vague memory of a very loud sound bursting forth from the tiny speaker of my tiny phone.

As I write this, I can still remember how numb my mind felt, how much my vision tunneled. My legs moved much the same as my fingers do now, typing this out – furiously and with unimaginable care. My first thought after my mind went blank only came after I found myself staring at my old school.

All was silent.

Suddenly, I started to slowly drip back into reality. My legs started to burn, my side felt like it had been stabbed, my lungs felt like soaked rags, my body was covered in sweat, and I felt that my heart was about burst forth from my chest.

I almost lost my balance, a gentle breeze nearly knocking me off of my feet, and I was amazed with myself that I managed to retain my balance, despite an abysmal blackness seeping in from the edges of my vision.

And yet, despite this, I still ran.

I ran towards the front door (which was quite a stupid move on my part…but alas, hindsight only hits after the fact).

My entire upper-body shook and swayed from side to side, as though it were a spinning top balancing itself on my moving legs.

I damn near collided with that entrance like a bull, narrowly avoiding any broken bones.

I pushed, and I pushed, the soles of my bare feet grating against the rough concrete below. The cold damn near burned my exposed skin off, as though the wisps of frigid air were tails of fire lashing at me like whips.

I can’t tell you how desperate I was.

The cold made my teeth want to chatter so hard that they would surely break, but I managed to keep my mouth shut.

The cold cement made me feel like I’d put both my feet in a bucket of nails, and the cold handle of the entrance door felt like it was slowly fusing to my hands.

Even so, I desperately tried to push, unaware of the tears that were slowly dripping from my eyes.

I felt my body approaching its limit.

I knew the next push would be my last.

I steadied myself, and I threw my entire torso forward while simultaneously pushing with my legs.

Time seemed to slow down.

I felt my right shoulder approaching the surface of the green door, and just before I collided with it, a shrill sound pierced my ear like a bullet while I barreled forward like a wrecking ball.

The last bell ring of the day.

My shoulder collided with the door, but instead of instantly breaking, I felt myself falling forward, and before I knew it, I found myself on the marble floor of the school entrance, right over the logo of my school – cold, beaten, and feeling as though rebar had been shoved thorough the very bones that made up my skeleton.

I screamed and got up onto my feet, damn near having my legs fail on me.

I expected many things at that moment as my gaze focused and widened.

The hallway to be dark from the lack of light.

Not fully lit.

The air to reek of blood.

Not pine essential oil.

I expected the floor to be littered with everyone’s bodies – all killed mid-crawl while desperately trying to escape.

Not for them all to be standing before me, holding their backpacks with school supplies, and ready to leave for the day.

I stood transfixed for a moment, as if petrified by their gazes.

My eyes spun wildly in my sockets, jittering madly as they scanned the vicinity.

Everything was perfect.

From the lights.

To the décor.

To my peers.

Nervously, some started to make their way past me to go outside, and once the others saw that I didn’t lunge for the brave ones, they too began to pass me.

Some even had the audacity to bump my shoulder, while the less ballsy ones giggled at my expense.

I stood there, the sea of people flowing past me as though I were leper.

I slowly turned, and stared at them as they left, their backs seemingly mocking me as they disappeared through the door I’d worked so hard to open.

The blood vessels in my eyes felt like barbed wire.

The bones in my hand felt like icicles.

And the bottoms of my feet felt as though they were stripped of their skin.

A hand placed itself on my bruised shoulder, and I immediately turned, ignoring the pain of my feet ripping from the ground, the dried blood having kept them still like superglue.

“Dude…” Tony said, “what happened?”

The look of concern he had made me break down.

I hugged him with all my might as the tears I’d been holding back started to gush out.

No one paid us any mind.

I feel no shame when remembering that moment.

That is, I don’t feel ashamed about being a teenager and hugging his best friend so hard that I must’ve cracked some of his ribs.

The only shame I feel is not punching the bastard that passed us at that moment.

The devil particularly likes to remind me of that one any chance he gets.

But his words have little effect on me.

Please don’t get me wrong.

I still wish I could have done things differently.

But honestly…how could I have known that the kid – one of hundreds – who passed me and Tony that day, at moment, had a spent assault rifle in his percussion case?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The cat won’t stop staring at me.

I was sitting in my grungy chair for God knows how long, but I just couldn’t type a damn thing. I didn’t realize it at first, but the reason why no words came to mind was because I couldn’t stop staring at this black cat perched on my window.

Its deep wicked green eyes seem to judge me.

I’m sure of it.

But I realize that it’s not the cat that’s judging me.

It’s my reflection.

My reflection on the cat’s eyes, slashed vertically by its irises, carries a look of disappointment and shame, displeased with what it is forced to look at.

*Is that really what I have become?* It asks itself.

No.

It wasn’t that I became like that.

I was always like that.

I just never truly looked it.

Until now.

…

Tony ate his burger without hesitation.

Even now, sitting in my cheap-ass apartment with a refrigerator full of slim-jims, I can vividly remember how he chewed through the layers of beef and pineapple of his double-decker delight that night.

I didn’t so much as touch my crispy fries.

The few patrons that were with us – truckers on a long haul – ate their meals in a strangely peaceful silence.

I, on the other hand, was emitting a strangling sort of silence, as if wanting to suck the air out of Tony, but he paid this no mind.

“You okay dude?” he asked, taking a break to wipe his mouth.

I found myself focused on my fries. I soaked in all of their detail, as if trying to imprint them on my mind.

“Ben,” tony continued, putting his burger down after seeing that I had no intention of opening my mouth, “do you want to talk about what happened yesterday?”

“I already told you what happened,” was all I could muster.

Tony didn’t avert his gaze like I had hoped.

Instead, he continued to stare at me with unflinching focus.

“Ben… you know that I’m wo-“

“Yeah,” I interrupted meekly.

Tony didn’t continue his sentence.

Instead, he leaned back.

“Look,” he said, “It’s true that an officer had come to us about some prank calls, but the presentation went without a single hitch. He said what he had to say, and then he went out. Then yo-….”

He caught himself mid-sentence.

“What was the deal with the prank phone calls? The hell were they about?”

Now, I ate my fries with a little more gusto.

“You don’t know?” Tony asked with a raised eyebrow.

I looked at him, not stopping my fry consumption.

“Right…” he remembered, “Well, what happened is that around a month ago, officers started to come to school to hand out warnings. Apparently, there have been multiple calls from the school, almost every day, about an active shooter, but they never find anything after responding. They lecture us about it, but the calls apparently haven’t stopped. Today, they actually played a recording of one of the calls. It was of…ahh, oh yeah. It was Kristina.”

My ears perked up slightly.

“Hmm, the hell does the captain of the gymnastics team have to do with these prank calls?”

Tony went silent for moment.

“You see…” he started, but struggled to continue.

A moment of awkward silence passed.

“The officer…damn man he literally played the 911 recording and you could hear Kristina’s voice, clear as day, echoing out and screaming at the operator. We were all speechless, I kid you not, but the one who was most shocked of all was Kristina. She swore up and down that it wasn’t her, but the principal organized her suspension for next week.”

Tony crossed his arms as if finding himself in deep thought.

He was always a better thinker than I could ever be.

“What time again did you say I called?” he asked, but special emphasis on the ‘I called’ part.

I also paused to think.

“Around two something–ish ,” was as specific as I could get.

“Huh,” Tony said, “Right at Professor. Baxman’s class.”

Tony again withdrew from reality and into the depths of his mind.

“Why does that matter?” I asked, feelings somewhat dejected by the lack of attention.

“Well…,” Tony started,” Believe it or not, I did actually go for a bathroom break at that time. But everything was fine man. I just finished my business and went back to class, and the rest of the day went as usual. Except for-“

He caught his words again, staring intently at me.

“You don’t have to feel guilty talking about it. Hell, I was the one who fucked up and even I don't care anymore.”

Tony surgically dissected me with his unbreaking gaze.

“Dude,” I said,” just…let it go.”

My friend could seemingly sense the defeat in my voice, more so than the stench of weed that my breath carried.

“But it’s weird,” he continued,” the phone call of Krista just kinda got to me. It sounded so…genuine.”

He nervously tapped the table with his index finger.

“I’m sorry,” I suddenly said.

Tony lifted his head, stopping his rhythmic taps at once.

“For what?” he asked, genuinely confused.

I sighed.

“About school.”

Tony leaned closer.

“So…” he started, “how have you been doing.”

One look at him and I could already tell that he knew the answer.

“I’m…” I started, but I didn’t have the guts to finish the sentence.

*I’m not crazy!* The words roared in my head.

But even I doubted them.

Seeing Tony, alive and well, really made me doubt them.

Looking back, I wish we talked more that night. I wish we could’ve said more words.

I wish we could’ve had one more night of peace, something to remember, but no.

We didn’t talk.

We ate in silence.

I strangled the words with my aura before they even had a chance to come out.

Nothing more was said.

Tony was talking with his eyes,

They said what I unconsciously forbade.

I wish I’d listened.

But most of all…I wish I could’ve heard them from his mouth.

…

As I walked down the lonely suburban road the next day, the crisp morning December air slashed at my face like the claws of a feral cat. This made me pull my straw-like scarf further up my face in response.

My sneakers rubbed against the desolate road like matches against sandpaper.

Piles of dirty snow clung to the edge of the sidewalk, and my long exhales condensed like cigarette smoke.

When I try to remember, I still have no idea why on that day I decided to return to school.

The strongest – but still vague – reason I can imagine is that I wanted to talk to Tony or Mrs. Hedge.

I think I wanted to apologize for how I’d acted that day.

Hell, I had fully committed myself to the belief that the entire affair with the phone call had really just been my imagination.

I wanted to put the incident behind me, and move forward.

I’d been prank called, or hallucinated, or whatever.

It didn’t matter as far as I was concerned.

I remember the distinct feeling of the cold concrete on my ass as I sat in front of the school entrance.

I was around forty or thirty minutes early, but I didn’t mind waiting until classes were over.

I wanted time to think.

I liked staring at the pure white snow, and going over what I’d tell Tony or Mrs. Hedge.

I thought about how maybe I should really start looking into getting a job and getting out of the house more often.

Maybe I could try to reapply to school.

It sickens me bow how bright things felt on that day.

It was just like I’ve said – whenever I’d talk to Tony, things always seemed a little less bad, and that really was the case on that day.

The frosty snow that surrounded me reflected back all of my dreams for the future, filling me with hope, like how you’d charge a phone.

I imagined how I’d treat Tony to a good burger, and I was fully lost in myself by that point.

The flashes of wonderful would-be scenarios kept racing through my mind.

They were so vivid that I failed to hear the person screaming at me from inside the school.

I only turned when the person started to pound on the door.

I turned my head, and locked eyes with Kristina.

I got up on my feet and stood frozen, staring as my helpless ex-classmate banged on the door and screamed, her voice muffled by the thick glass that separated us.

She was bloodied, I could tell as much, and her face a hot mess from the tears gushing out of her eyes and rolling down her face.

*HELP ME! LET ME OUT!*

Those were the only words I could read from her lips.

I should have acted.

I had plenty of time to open the door, but I didn’t.

I didn’t because my mind was full of thoughts bouncing around my skull, clouding my thinking.

*“I was right what do I do I should help her am I dreaming should I run am I in danger is this a prank help help should I no is she actually in danger of course or maybe yes I don’t know I don’t know what should I do what should I do what should I do”* is an accurate enough idea of what a psychic would hear if they were to look inside my mind.

I couldn’t decide what to do, and it still haunts me to this day.

I can feel it in my fingers right now as I type this.

And I am ashamed to only admit that I only came out of my continues trance when a blotch of crimson exploded and coated the glass before me like a water balloon filled with red paint.

There was no bang.

Maybe that’s why I didn’t go into fight or flight mode.

I felt myself shivering, as if my bones were vibrating, but strangely, I didn’t feel cold.

I approached the door at an utter loss as to what to do.

I gazed forward, as if staring into an endless scarlet abyss.

Before I knew it, I found myself frozen once more, transfixed by the symphony of bodily fluids splashed across the gently frosted window.

Little did I realize that my vision was once again tunneling, as if consumed by the infinite crimson chasm before me.

I slowly got closer and closer, as if sucked in.

Even now, the red is pasted on my eyes, forever burned in my memory.

It was only once all I could see was red that I finally got a grip on reality.

And this was only after a hand slapped itself on the surface of the glass.

I fell back hard on the concrete, the pain shooting up my hip restoring my lucidity in a heartbeat.

Now my heart pumped like a speaker, and the pace of my breathing matched its rhythm perfectly.

It felt as though they were crushing the organs in my torso.

Just remembering it makes me feel like it’s happening to me right now, as if each stroke of my keyboard translates to stab somewhere deep inside of me.

I watched in horror as the hand slid across the window, wiping away the bloody gunk, and I became petrified by the welding mask that peered out.

They settled on me like the eyes of a machine, and regarded me coolly as if assessing whether or not I was a threat.

I fully expected the door to open and myself to be shot either right where I stood or as I ran (if I had found the courage).

But instead, to my shock, I saw them turning away and walking off.

When I felt my breathing slow down, the intervals of deep and sudden breaths lengthening, I peeled off the ground, but instead of running, I practically smashed my face in the window, peering through the tiny window of gore that had been made. I saw part of Kristina’s body slumped on the floor, along with others, and I saw a trail of bloody footsteps leading off into the distance and into one of the many corridors of the school.

Even though it was the middle of the day, things were far darker than they should’ve been, even with the lights turned off. It was as if the walls were sucking away the light from the windows like smoke from a lit cigarette.

It…it was real.

I knew it right then and there that it was real.

All of it.

I hadn’t just imagined it.

I should’ve gone to the cops.

I should’ve run away.

But I was just a stupid kid.

At that moment, all that I wanted to do was get inside.

To this day I don’t know why.

There are so many things I wonder about.

*Why* is how most (if not all) of them start with.

All of the doors at school were locked.

They wouldn’t budge.

I should’ve left.

I should've gone to get help.

But I didn’t.

I was pushing my luck without even knowing it.

I was about to give up, but I didn’t, and I still regret it.

There was one door that I didn’t think would be locked.

See, the thing about my school is that it had a main loading dock in the back, but what no one knew is that there was an older one from back in the day sealed away with brick and hidden away behind dumpsters, but they hadn’t covered the small door that led inside of it.

It discovered it who knows when, and it was at precisely at that moment that I remembered it.

I rushed to the two dumpsters in the back and wedged myself between them.

I smeared myself against them, until I made it to the small opening behind, which was just big enough for me to open the rusty door.

Before I knew it, I found myself in the old dusty, musty, and cob web-ridden loading dock.

Up a short incline stood a door that hadn’t been touched in ages.

Soon, the loading dock was silent once more.

And the handle of the door wasn’t as dusty as before.

…

I’m sorry…but I have to stop. It has taken me over four hours to write the last fifty sentences.

I’ve been pacing around my kitchen.

I can’t think straight.

The memories haunt me.

It’s late.

They’re all trying to gush out of a needle.

I better go to sleep.

The devil will tell me what to write next.

Which part I should take away from him.

Because I sure as hell don’t know.

The cat won’t stop staring.

*I* won’t stop staring.

The look on my face is the same I had at the start.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I remember it clearly.

The sound my foot made when I took my first step in that building.

It was like accidentally stepping on spoiled fruit.

It was a disgusting squelch, something that made the muscle fibers under my skin feel like they were being played by the bow of a violin.

It was too dark to see anything.

Far too dark.

It looked as though the walls of the school had ceased to exist.

A dark, pulsating and sludge-like mass covered every possible surface.

It sounded like a heartbeat.

It didn’t seem to react whenever I stepped on it, but the sound it made as I walked through the desolate school hallways made my skin shrivel and crinkle like countless bugs were jittering around in it.

That was the only sound that I could hear.

Everything else was simply deafening silence.

The once pale-white floors were now a deep crimson red.

It spilled from every single classroom and flowed down the long corridor.

I nearly slipped, and nearly vomited, but most of all, I nearly fainted.

The only thing that kept me lucid through the nightmare I found myself in that day was the thought of finding Tony and Mrs. Hedge.

I worried that the armed shooter would come out at any moment, having patiently waited for a lucky pounce.

But he didn’t.

I walked through hallway after hallway, and needless to say, I found myself disoriented as hell.

I could’ve sworn that I’d passed the same hallway five times in a row.

I stopped and got out my phone before doing something that I regret to this day.

I called him.

I called Tony.

I regretted it the moment the rings of that damned phone bounced against the walls and through that grotesque corridor.

I immediately turned it off, but the damage was done.

I heard a set of squelching footsteps, their sharp noise scraping my ear drums, and I knew that I didn’t have long.

I could feel it.

My mind went blank and my senses panned for a moment allowing me to soak up all of my surroundings.

I stepped into the bathroom that was not ten feet away from where I stood.

Without hesitation, barely able to brave through the putrid smell that assaulted my nostrils, I pushed a large garbage bin for used paper towels in front of the door.

I knew it wouldn’t hold.

I took out my phone, somehow aware of the approaching footsteps of my impending doom.

The bathroom was even more horrible than I remembered it.

The walls were splattered with so, so much blood.

Each drop of it reflected the light of my phone back to me, as if carrying the screams of those it had once flowed through.

Looking back, I wish I could’ve taken some sort of video, but this was the early 2000s. Camera cellphones had barely come out.

People weren’t used to using them to film anything and everything.

And I sure as hell didn’t have one.

All I had was the dim light of my screen.

And that was that.

Outside, I could sense the footsteps coming closer.

Even now, they rattle my muscles as though I’ve swallowed an entire speaker.

Again, my mind went blank, and I rushed to the only stall door that was open.

I went in…and I still regret doing so.

Tony sat lifelessly on the toilet, no doubt the same one he’d sat in when he’d called me two days ago.

His phone still lay clutched to his hand, as though rigor mortis had set in the moment the bullet blew his head to smithereens.

I stared.

I didn’t feel disgust.

I didn’t feel sadness.

I didn’t feel numb.

Nor angry.

The only thing in my mind at that moment was the memory of how he had been eating his burger the day before.

How he’d wanted to talk to me.

And how I hadn’t wanted to hear single word of it.

Now, all of his memories coated the interior of that one stall.

I felt as though I could see them all, like an engraving on a small grain of rice.

I didn’t react until the shooter rammed the door in for the second time.

It felt like the entire room was shaking every time he struck the door with his body.

I had no time to think about my best friend.

I feel ashamed to admit it, but at that moment, I shifted gears into flight mode, and I immediately stepped on the toiled behind Tony, careful not to slip on any of his brain matter, and I pushed to panel above me, ready to climb into the ceiling.

I jumped up the moment I heard the garbage can hit the wall.

He came in right as I was ready to grab something to lift myself up.

But I didn’t manage to grab anything.

I fell.

But not down.

I felt myself being pulled up, and before I knew, I felt as though I were falling down, and then I lay in a heap of agony on a random school corridor.

I hadn’t gone through the ceiling.

I looked up, and what I saw was what broke me.

It was what broke my spirit.

My hope.

And my understanding of the world.

Above me, one of the ceiling tiles was missing, the same one I fell from.

The very same one I was climbing through.

Above me sat the stall I had fallen from, as though I were looking at it from up. Tony’s body still lay on the toilet, and I saw the shooter walk in. He looked up, and made contact with me down below (or up above from his perspective).

He leveled his rifle at me, and I ran as a hail of bullets erupted from that opening like rain gushing out of a pipe.

It was only now that I felt numb.

That I felt angry.

That I felt true fear.

It wasn’t this deep feeling in the pit of my stomach, but more like each cell in my body was begging my mind for permission to self-destruct.

I had stepped into something beyond me.

My brain had assimilated and synthesized everything before I had.

This was no mere school shooting.

This was hell.

An endless and repeating nightmare.

I passed hallway after hallway, and I knew I was going through the exact same ones no matter how much I ran, but there were always different bodies splattered on the ground.

It’s amazing how we can identify someone just by their clothing.

I felt as though they were trying to grab my legs, but I still fled.

Their voices felt like they were in my head.

Eventually, though, the fire started to die, and I felt myself gradually slowing down.

At first, I started to jog, then walk, and then my shins lay flat against the ground, and then I was crawling for a bit, before I finally stopped.

I was smeared in blood.

I was smeared in guts.

I was smeared in bile.

And I was smeared in pathetic shame.

I wanted to lay there.

I felt that I had deserved it.

I felt that I had it coming.

I shouldn’t be here writing this down.

And yet I am.

All because of a moment I wish just didn’t happen.

I heard my name.

Through the doorway of a classroom right next to me, I heard someone calling my name.

“B….ben…”

It was faint.

But I still heard it.

And I still turned.

And I still regret it.

I saw her.

Mrs. Hedge.

Her torso barely peeped out of her desk, right in front of the large window she always sat against.

Now, that window illuminated the massacre that had taken place in there.

It was partially open, a gentle breeze wafting the smell of decay straight into my face like a cup of boiling coffee.

“B…Ben” she said, this time with much more strength.

I don’t know why, but it felt like I had been doused in gasoline.

The small spark in me instantly burst like a flambe flame.

I ran over to my former English teacher, and cradled her thinning head in my arms.

*You’re going to be okay. I’m here now* was what I desperately wanted to say, but the words failed me when I looked at the rest of her – the part that was hidden by her desk that is.

Mrs. Hedge’s lower half had been turned into mincemeat.

How she was alive with everything below her stomach looking like it had been shoved through a meat grinder I still don’t know, nor do I think I will ever know.

But she was.

I took off my bloodied coat and covered the mess with it.

She looked into me with her deep eyes, and continued to speak.

“y-y-y….” she struggled, “y-y-you must get out of here…N…N...no matter what.”

I distinctly remember getting the feeling that she wanted to ask why I was there…but realized she didn’t have the strength to do so.

“The…The…The…w-w-w-w”

She couldn’t finish it.

She never did finish that sentence.

She couldn’t.

But I knew she wanted me to go through the window.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway, and we looked at each other.

Both of us knew that this was the end.

I said I didn’t want to leave.

I told her with my eyes.

But instead, the old woman who was being dragged through death’s door grabbed my pants near my hip, as if trying to lift herself over wall.

“R…run” she said, in a barely audible voice.

To this day... I remember how it sounded like her vocal cords had been replaced with dry corn husks... and I can't imagine how she found it in herself to speak in that condition.

The boots came to a halt, and in that moment of silence where no action took place and time seemed to stand still, I was faced with a choice.

I jumped through the open window.

I ran.

I ran like a lion with my tail between my legs.

I think I was crying…but I can’t be sure.

My eyes were just focused on the deep woods a hundred yards in front of me.

I ran through that cold field, the icy wind slashing my under-dressed body like I was crawling through a tunnel stuffed full of barbed wire.

I expected a hail of bullets to rip the ground around me before finally ripping me to shreds.

But that didn’t happen.

It didn’t.

Something worse happened.

I only heard one shot echo behind me, and that was that.

…

I burst into the police station a bloody mess from the wait down.

I was inconsolable.

I don’t have any memory of it.

I only remember being at the back of a police cruiser in front of a squadron of cars and one SWAT van.

I remember the bell ringing.

And I remember everyone coming out…safe and sound.

I think I stepped out and stood there.

I started to scream.

I don’t remember what.

But the next thing I know, I’m getting tazed.

Then I find myself in an empty holding cell.

Their words buzzed in my mind.

I was an addict.

I had gotten high and was entangled in a long and elaborate joke.

Another officer would be coming to the school for another presentation the next day.

I would be processed the next day.

I lay in my lonely cell, looking up.

I wonder why I couldn’t just have just died.

I was horrified that they were all alive, because I knew they would be slaughtered the very next day.

But I doubted that then.

The doubt resurfaced again.

I was ready to accept whatever they’d feed me in the interrogation room.

I would soak it all up like a sponge without apprehension, and recite it to a judge without hesitation.

I would have done that.

I really would have.

I was bloody beyond belief.

*Animal blood* they had assumed.

*Sure...why not?*

But then I put my hands in my pockets for warmth in that dark cell, and I felt my left hand brush against something.

I took out the note that Mrs. Hedge had somehow managed to slip in my pocket.

It wasn’t her handwriting.

But I did recognize it...from someone I'd copy often during tests.

It belonged to a poor sap who’d been shot to oblivion right outside the cafeteria.

*The number of bullets can be seen on the gun.*

That’s what it read.

I couldn’t imagine what it had taken for that note to make it to Mrs. Hedge.

I also couldn’t imagine just how she’d kept it tight in her hands after her lower half had been obliterated by a hail of bullets.

But most of all...I...I just couldn't fathom, even now, how she could look me in the eyes on that disgusting day...and still have the same kind and hopeful look I’d always seen on her every single damn day in class.

Hello, I have a warning for anyone wanting to visit a library as you may be stuck like I am forever. Let me give you some insight so maybe you can avoid my fate. This all started when I wanted to go into a library in my city. You see the city I live in isn't by any means "large" It's more of an average-sized city that is the hub of three national highways. Not much goes on here until recently when it was reported that someone went missing at the library. I work for the local newspaper and they wanted me to go down to check what was happening. Since a police report was filed and the only thing they were able to do was to file a missing person report. When I got there the police were already done but I wanted to do my own digging so I asked the librarian what happened. 

"Hello, I am a reporter for the local paper "The Ridge Beach Herald". I wanted to know if you had any information you could give the news?" I spoke with confidence 

The librarian seemed nervous and a bit scared when he spoke. "Well, to tell you the truth not much we can give. When checking the cameras the young woman came in and grabbed a book in the fictional aisle and never left. We don't have enough cameras to cover all the aisles so we have no clue where she could've gone. But we know she has never left because the cameras would show her leaving." 

"May I see the camera feed so I can make sure? That's if you don't mind of course." I said while smiling and rubbing my neck. 

The librarian looked a little worried and wanted to tell me something but nothing came out. He instead just waved me toward a door behind the desk. Inside the room was one computer and a few filing cabinets. He sat down at the computer and logged into the system. Pulling up the cameras he then just pointed to the screen and spoke. 

"Well, here she is in stone wash blue pants and a teal-colored shirt. If you watch she comes to the fictional aisle and stares at the wall for almost twenty minutes then shakes her head. She then goes and grabs a book and walks behind this wall. We haven't seen her since... the strangest thing is there's nothing there when you go to where she was. It's just a couch and two chairs with a small table and magazines."  He looked a bit shaken up when he showed me. "She has been gone for almost a whole month. It just makes no sense." 

I thanked the man and then decided to take a look around the library. I have my tape recorder on and was recording everything I saw that seemed odd. As I got to the fiction section, I saw a wall poster with just a few little rules. Nothing too odd except for one. 

1. No Excessive talking or loud noises 
2. No Food Or Drinks 
3. No Running
4. Report all book damage to the librarian
5. Use bookmarks 
6. Place the books back where they belong
7. Never fall asleep while reading

At the time I thought the last one was a little odd but I could imagine why it exists. I walked around the same wall the missing girl did and saw the couch and chairs like the librarian said. However, there was a book at the table sitting there open without a bookmark. Thinking nothing of it I walked to the table and laid my backpack down at the foot of the chair I was sitting on. I pulled out my laptop and started to write the story while quietly listening to my recordings. 

While sitting there and listening I heard a voice in the background after reading the rules. "Help me...Help me... help me..." The disembodied voice sent a chill up my spine as it seemed so uncanny kind of human but not quite there. I was a little taken back by this and decided to look around the area I was. When I got to the poster and looked around there was nothing there other than a red bookmark with the words "Keep Calm and read on" I picked it up and walked back to my chair. I placed the bookmark on the book that was still open as I wasn't sure who left it there. 

I kept typing away to this story when I felt someone or something was staring at me. An overwhelming sense of dread washed over me as I felt fear. Looking around I kept seeing nothing however I still had this funny feeling that I was in danger and being watched. I closed my laptop and stood up... I kept feeling this dread so I decided to walk around and maybe look and see if anyone was watching me. I turned the corner and nothing... no one was there. I looked behind the shelves and rows of books and saw nothing. I decided to sit back down and started to write more. 

After about half an hour I started to feel drowsy but I had to get this paper out. So I finally finished it and started to proofread the story. The further I read the more I drifted off to sleep. I believe I finally passed out because I woke up in panic-induced cold sweats. I looked around and I was still in the same library. I decided to get up and pack my things after submitting my story. Walking downstairs I noticed something was very off. The lights were much dimmer and there wasn't a single person there. I looked around and it was nothing like the library I was in. There are endless rows of books with tables and chairs scattered throughout.

I started to panic and started to run in one direction... eventually ran out of breath and could still not see an end in sight. I kept looking for an exit and started to shout "Hello! Is anyone there?" It just lept echoing with no response back. So I kept walking in one direction hoping to come across someone or anything at this point. My hope dwindled as I realize this wasn't a dream and I was here. I was so exhausted and needed to rest. I found a chair and a table that had a lamp on it that was turned on but had no powerline. 

As I sat there I decided to open my laptop and it seemed I still had internet somehow and the battery on my laptop was showing that it was fully charged. This was odd because I never plugged it in today, to be honest, this was the least of my worries. It wasn't long until I heard another voice whispering at me through the aisle of books. I turned to see who was talking to me and it was a younger woman who couldn't be older than thirty. She had light blue eyes and was covered in dust. 

"Oh shit! Someone else is here!" I shouted in happiness and excitement. 

"Not so loud or THEY will hear us. Look I have been following you for some time and not far from here is a settlement where other people are. We are trying to find a way out and survive. Come with me" She spoke in a hushed tone. 

"Who are they?" I asked

"Just follow me when we are safe we can talk." She stood up and slowly started to walk toward the end of the aisle to meet me. We both stood there and she nodded and gestured for me to follow her. After what seemed like half an hour of walking we arrived at the makeshift settlement. It was a bunch of bookshelves turned to make a small fortress.  It was pressed up against a corner of two walls one side having a bathroom and the other looking to be a staff room that had a small kitchen. As we entered inside there was a population of about twenty people here. All of different races and sizes however no matter the language it seems we all could understand it. I got to sit down and speak to the lady who saved me. 

"So what are the things you were talking about earlier?" I asked nervously. 

"Well, we call them the librarians. They are large spider-like creatures who have human faces and long black hair. If you are too loud they can find you easily however they seem to be blind so not making any noise makes it to where they can't find us. Here we are safe to make noise but we don't know why." She spoke in a relaxed tone. 

"So how do we eat and drink? I'm really hungry and didn't bring any food." My stomach growled as I spoke which caused a slight bit of pain. 

"Well, the staff kitchen seems to have a near limitless supply of food. No matter what we take from the fridge it seems to restock itself. So help yourself." 

It's been weeks and I still haven't found a way out. I walked what seems to be a hundred miles which lead nowhere. Last night I saw a librarian for the first time... This was when a man named Jerry started to walk with me to find more survivors. We walked a couple of miles away and heard a yelling "Anyone there?? Hello?" We started to pick up the pace and rounded a corner to find a man yelling and asking for help. He spotted us and he shouted again "Hey!! Over here! Help me!". Before we can tell him to be quiet it was too late. A librarian pounced on him and was tearing him into pieces. Chunks of flesh were being tossed... every bite the librarian took seemed to spray a fine mist of blood into the air. Filling the air with the smell of iron. It took everything I could to not vomit as I could hear the muscle snapping off the bone like a rubber band breaking. The sound of bone crunching and blood squelching was the only thing we heard as we silently walked away... 

I wish I was home...

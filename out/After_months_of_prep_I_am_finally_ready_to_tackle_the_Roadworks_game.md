“*Road* work ahead?-” Theo begins, with a big, dumb grin on his face. I can see the whites of his teeth in the corner of my eye.

“Don’t fucking say it bro” I interrupt with a mutter, fingers flexing on the steering wheel. “You don’t need to say it”.

“-YEAH I sure HOPE it does!” he finishes, chortling to himself as I swear under my breath.

I’ve always hated that stupid vine.

“How are we doing on the time?” I ask him, changing the subject.

He checks his watch, his phone, and the car’s clock. “All in sync dude. 2:17am. We got five minutes”.

“Perfect”, I respond, as we drive down the length of dark and empty highway. “We’re actually going to make it this time”.

“Have we got far to go?”

“No”, I tell him. “Just a bit further on. It’s hard to see but there’s a load of hills just ahead, to the right. That’s where we’re going”.

“Right”, he responds, settling back into his seat.

This took place on June 17th and 18th. It was right after we had graduated. We had just left the school organized grad night party and wanted to do something fun and semi risky. After talking about it and driving around a bit, we decided to go explore a semi abandoned convention floor in a nearby casino. It was the kind of convention center that was only used like twice a year. All it took was two escalator rides and the second one spilled you out right at the main floor. As soon as the escalator spilled out us out onto the convention floor however, the whole vibe changed. 

The floor was huge and empty. Random things littered the area, such as chairs, tables, pictures, and doorways. A lot of doorways. Some closed, some open. The carpeting was white, blue, and yellow, with strange almost flower like designs. The whole place was dead silent except for the sound of a nearby soda machine. We just kind of aimlessly wandered around for a few minutes, cracking jokes about how it looked like the Backrooms. We found a cool dark staircase that was barely lit by small florescent lights, but suddenly one of my buddies walked over to one of the open doorways, and said “Guys check this out.” We walked over and all glanced through. 

The it led into was dark and empty, and led across to another open doorway. We immediately got that smug look on our faces and quietly made our way across the room into the other doorway. The room we crossed had a large desk, but was otherwise empty. A massive chandelier hung over the room and gave off an eerie vibe. Once we crossed into the open doorway, things got weirder. The room that the door led to was large and thin. The walls and ceiling were blue, and the hall had about 20 doorways on each side. One of my buddies and I decided to open one of the doors on the left, and what we saw both made us gasp and then start to strangely giggle out of pure confusion. 

It led to a massive room. Probably the size of a typical school cafeteria. The carpets were the same as the main floor, and the walls and ceiling were blue. It had a small stage and a curtain, but was otherwise empty. There was an open doorway on the back wall. We crossed the large room and toward the door. It led to a kitchen-like area. It was littered with pots, pans, and utensils. I decided to stay back and watch for anything while the rest of my buddies went in to explore. Even though it was empty, who knows if a security guard would think we were trespassing. This is where things got serious strange. 

As I was waiting, I swear I heard voices. These were not my friends voices. These were heavy, fast, and aggressive. This followed with even heavier and aggressive footsteps, and they were coming straight for the big room. I tried to play it off as being paranoid. But that quickly washed away when I heard a door slam outside the room. Adrenaline kicked in. If this was a security guard, we had a matter of seconds before he would see me standing there in this back room. I flipped around to tell my buddies, nearly slamming into one of them. My exact words were “There’s fucking people! We gotta go! NOW!” He turned around to tell them, but we suddenly heard a scream from inside the kitchen. 

We heard “FUCK! GO GO GO GO!!!” All of us charged across the big room, out into the hallway, through the chandelier room, and back out onto the main floor. As we were running, I half expected to run into a security guard. But there were no signs of anything. No people, no voices, no doors looked different. We didn’t hesitate to get back on the escalator and back down to the main floor with people. 

As we drove home, my buddies who were in the kitchen explained that about five seconds before I yelled we had to go, they looked down a corridor, and saw a figure stick it’s head out around the corner and look right at them. We all immediately decided to go there again the very next night, and in my head I decided I wasn’t going to play lookout. I was going to go into that kitchen. 

Fast forward to the next day, and we immediately went into the kitchen. I walked into it, and saw immediately that it was very mistreated. Dirty dishes were spilled all over it, and it was dirty. We went through it, and saw a dirty white hallway. We glanced into it, but didn’t want to go too far into it. So we immediately turned around, and what happened next scared the shit out of us. A door to our right immediately started to wiggle, and then violently shake. We booked it back through the kitchen, and all the way back to the main floor. Instead of going back down to the main casino, we decided to explore some more. We went down a brand new hallway, and found a door that was unlocked. It immediately led to a staircase leading downward. 

We walked down it, and it turned left into what looked like a small theater. There was again a small stage, and then a row of chairs going from the stage to almost the back wall. We walked up to the stage, and were creeped out when we saw a jacket lying on the stage, dirty and ripped. We immediately felt creeped out. We were walking back up the stairs when I suddenly felt uneasy. I flipped around to say something to one of my buddies, and saw a shadow cross the stage and behind the curtain. I screamed, and we ran back to the main floor. We decided we were done for now, and left in some elevators instead of the escalator to the main casino. 

For now, we haven’t been back to that convention center. We all experienced strange things there, and felt uneasy whenever we were in the back exploring. I’m sure one day we’ll be back, but for right now, we’re done.

“Look’s like there’s a storm approaching.”

I glanced out the window of the car and looked behind us as my fiancée Sabrina came out of the shop with the bag of snacks for our trip. The sky looked gray just a few feet behind us down the road. I heard low rumbling as Sabrina opened the driver's side door and got in. 

“Do you think the roads will get bad?” I asked her. 

She glanced behind us for a few seconds before turning on the engine. The 80’s station we had been listening to on our road trip turned on and the music filled the car as Sabrina pulled out of the gas station parking lot. 

“We can always pull over if they do,” she replied. 

“Don’t you think we should fill up on gas soon?” I asked.

“I think we should be fine for now.”

I glanced over at the dashboard. “There’s a quarter of a tank left,” I noted. 

“Babe, it’s fine, trust me. You worry too much. Besides, that's more than a quarter.”

I sighed as I tried not to let it bug me. I hated getting lower than half a tank in my own car. It stressed me out to no end.

We pulled out into the road and I grabbed my phone as I opened the weather app. I looked at the forecast for the day. Sunny with a high of 95. That couldn’t be right. 

I made sure that I had cell service before opening the app again, thinking that maybe it would refresh. I didn’t however, and the forecast still said the same.

“Huh,” I said, “that’s weird.”

“What’s weird?” Sabrina asked. 

I looked in the side mirror at the darkening skies behind me. The clouds were catching up to us quickly. 

“Melany?”

I glanced back at Sabrina. “The weather app says it’s supposed to be sunny today.”

“Maybe the app is down?”

“Yeah…maybe,” I replied. 

We continued down the road and stopped at a red light. I shifted in my seat so I could look behind us at the approaching storm. I could see the dark clouds moving across the sky, heading directly towards us. 

I turned back to face the road ahead of us when suddenly the sound of thunder boomed across the sky. I jumped as it was followed by a flash of lightning. 

All of a sudden. A scream erupted behind us. 

“What was that?” Sabrina asked. 

“Oh my god! Oh my god, what the fuck?!” Someone yelled. 

The people in the cars around us began to roll down their windows to get a better view of whatever was happening. Sabrina shifted the car into “park” and undid her seatbelt as she opened the door and stepped out of the car. I followed, walking in between the traffic as I followed Sabrina. 

There was a crowd forming a few feet away where an old woman was crying and shouting nonsense. 

I looked up at the sky again and noticed that the grey clouds were even closer now, and I couldn’t see anything in the distance anymore. I glanced back towards the car and then up at the traffic light, which was now green. 

No one was driving off yet though, as everyone had gotten out of their cars to investigate. 

Suddenly, the loud sound of crushing metal caught my attention as I looked towards the sound. A white pickup truck had been almost completely crushed. I squinted to get a closer look, and I noticed that there seemed to have been a person inside the truck when it was flattened, and their blood and insides covered the windshield. 

I looked away quickly as I took deep breaths, trying not to gag. Other people had started to walk toward the crushed truck and some were gagging and backing up as they realized what they were seeing. 

“What the fuck is going on?!” Someone screamed. 

Again, the sound of crushing metal was heard and a second car had been crushed. This time, it had only been the hood of the car that had been crushed and the driver ran out to look at the damage. 

“GET BACK IN YOUR CARS! NOW!” Someone screamed. 

I locked eyes with Sabrina and we ran to the car, getting in and slamming the doors shut as Sabrina shifted back into drive and managed to pull in between the cars and speed through the intersection. 

I kept looking behind us as the clouds continued to approach. I could see rain drops now. Some of the people had made it away just in time, and others got caught in the rain. The sound of multiple cars being crushed filled the street as Sabrina sped down the road. 

Lucky for us, it was mainly empty. I held on to the armrest as Sabrina kept speeding. 

“Is that the rain doing that?” I asked, glancing back again. 

“I think so,” Sabrina muttered. 

She continued to drive, hyper-focused on the road. I glanced over at the speedometer. She was going almost 90. I looked over at the side of the road as we passed a speed limit sign but said nothing. 

I looked back at the approaching storm. The rain had picked up excessively, and all of the trees and stoplights had been crushed. They were now crumpled up in the middle of the road, blocking anyone else from escaping the storm. 

As I glanced down in the rearview mirror, I noticed that most of the road was gone too; there were giant holes everywhere, making it impossible to drive on. 

My body flung forward as Sabrina hit the brakes all of a sudden. The sound of the screeching breaks and the tires on the road filled my ears as she tried to stop the car. 

“Shit, shit, shit!” She exclaimed. 

The car finally came to a stop and I looked over at her. 

“Why are you stopping?” 

She motioned towards the road where there was a giant tree branch blocking the way. 

“Help me move it, hurry.”

I jumped out of the car and helped her to push the branch out of the way. As we pushed, I couldn’t help but glance toward the storm, which was still rapidly approaching. The rain was also picking up, and it seemed like we were right; the rain was to blame. 

I used all my strength to push on the branch as Sabrina pulled and we finally got it out of the way. 

We ran back to the car and I glanced back to see the rain approaching. As the first drop of rain landed on the roof of a small convenience store on the side of the road, it all crumbled to the ground. 

I slid into the seat of the car. 

“What do you think happens if it lands on someone?” I asked.

Sabrina turned to look at me. 

She opened her mouth to speak but didn’t get to, as she glanced out one of the back windows. 

I followed her gaze to see a man walking down the side of the road. In a split second, the rain caught up. One second he was there, and the next second there was a splatter of blood and human insides on the sidewalk. 

“I guess that’s your answer,” Sabrina said as she started driving again. 

I turned around in my seat to keep an eye on the storm. It seemed that the winds had started to pick up and I could hear them whistling as Sabrina continued to drive. 

“It’s getting faster Sabrina,” I replied. 

She said nothing, but I could feel the speed of the car picking up. 

We’ve been on the road for about half an hour now, and the storm seems to consistently pick up speed with each second that passes. 

I can’t stop myself from looking back at the approaching storm, and all of the damage that the rain has done. 

We’ve seen it crush a few more people as it passes through. I don’t know how long this storm is going to last, or how far out it’s going to travel, but I’m hoping that I can at least warn a few people. Maybe you can make a plan to outrun it. 

We’re going to run out of gas soon, and there’s no way that we would have enough time to stop and fill up on gas without the storm catching up to us and crushing our car, and then us. 

I don’t know what we’re going to do. We haven’t even passed another car that we could potentially steal to try to outrun the storm. I don’t know if anyone will even see this, or how this will even help, but if you start to see the storm approaching; start running.

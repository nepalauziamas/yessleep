You know when people say “if something seems to good to be true, it usually is”?  Turns out they’re right.


I recently moved in with my boyfriend. He has a beautiful flat in an old building. Penthouse, and everything. We hadn’t been together that long, but I knew from the first time I met him that he was the one. We’d be together ‘til death do us part, if it was up to me at least. 


At the beginning of the relationship, I wasn’t sure if he felt the same way. He was always a bit distant, he always referred to me as babe, honey, some nickname, never my name. According to “John Tucker must die”, a movie filled to the brim with advice for life, this is a clear way of knowing that a guy is two timing you. I’m sure he was seeing multiple girls at the beginning, but that’s ok. It’s the 21st century after all. But that’s not what this story is about. 


When he asked me to move in with him, I was thrilled. I had been living in a crappy flat share with 6 other people, and owned no furniture. Packing up my stuff was easy, and his apartment was a dream. I had only been over there two or three times before I moved in – for some reason he always seemed to prefer staying at my place. Maybe it made him feel young, who knows. 


Cal worked a lot, so I would spend the days alone in the flat. I’m a painter. And Cal was very supportive of my art. He told me I could use the spare bedroom as an atelier, and he even convinced me to quit my waitressing job so I could dedicate all my time to my art. I loved him so much. 


The first days in the flat, as I was setting up the atelier, I heard sounds coming from the wall. “Rats. Damn.” I’ve lived in my fair share of crappy flats, so I’m not unfamiliar with the sounds of critters in the walls. 


Then the flies appeared. I was taking a break from painting, sitting on the floor of the atelier, eating a slice of pizza, trying to figure out what the piece was missing. A fat fly landed on my  pizza. I shook it, angrily. I spotted another fat fly buzzing right next to it. 


I looked around the room. There were at least 5 flies there. 


When I told Cal about it later, he got really annoyed.


“What the hell have you been doing in there?”


I shrugged, frowning. His anger surprised me, made me uncomfortable.


“You don’t eat in there, do you?” He asked, disgusted.


“I... Sometimes?” 


“Well, maybe if you weren’t such a pig, this wouldn’t happen! God, if you’re gonna make  a mess, at least don’t complain to me about it!”


“I – I’m sorry!” I exclaimed, distressed. His whole demeanour changed so fast. “It didn’t occur to me that it was my fault!”


“Aw, babe, no. I’m sorry. It’s just – I’ve been under a lot of pressure lately. I didn’t mean to take it out on you. Just ignore the flies, I’m sure they’ll go away eventually.”


The next day there were even more flies. I didn’t say anything to Cal, I was too worried about his reaction. There was also a strange smell in the room. I was sincerely worried that I had accidentally dropped food somewhere, so I cleaned the whole room. Nothing. I had left the window wide open since I moved in - I like to paint in the cold – so I decided the smell and the flies must be coming from somewhere outside. I closed the window.


I when I returned to the room after getting lunch, the smell had gotten much worse. I hadn’t really noticed it as I painted, but after the fresh air from the outside, the stench was impossible to ignore. A rank stench of decay. I closed the door, and opened the window. I decided I had to talk to Cal about it later. I guessed one of the rats had died in the walls, or something. 


“Yeah, it does smell a little funky in here. Rats? No, we don’t have rats here. No, I’m pretty sure we don’t. I don’t know why you would think that, too much paint fumes in that little room?” His eyes went dark with anger before he managed to pull himself together. I hadn’t realized how temperamental he was before I moved in with him. “You know what, I bet it’s from that downstairs neighbour.” Cal’s demeanour changed, he relaxed. “You remember the weird guy we saw in the lift that first day?” I shuddered. I remembered. “I bet it’s him. His flat would be right under this room. I don’t wanna know what he’s doing down there… You just spray some febreeze, I’m sure it’ll go away eventually.”


How could I forget the downstairs neighbour? I had only seen him once, the day I moved in, but it had made an impression.


We had been taking the elevator down to get the last of my stuff, and it stopped on the floor below the flat. I noticed Cal looking uncomfortable, probably anticipating the neighbour. The doors opened, and I felt my nostrils flare in objection. The man waiting outside the doors was tall, skinny, dressed all in black, and smelt worse than anyone I have ever encountered. He locked eyes with me, then let his gaze slide over to Cal, and then back to me. I shuddered involuntarily. He frowned, staring at me for several seconds. Then he entered the lift without a word. We rode down in silence. 


Every time I took that elevator I worried that I’d run into him. I tried not to think about what he could be doing in that flat to cause a smell like this one floor up. 


The next day there were more flies, and the smell was even stronger. I called Cal at work.


“You’re exaggerating, it can’t be that bad. Just get some febreeze, and get over it. And don’t disturb me at work unless it’s actually important. If there is a rat there, the smell will go away eventually. Don’t be such a damn princess.”


I didn’t really want to press the issue, he seemed to be really stressed. I just kept the door closed and the window open, and sprayed the whole room with febreeze like he told me to. I spent the day sketching outside instead, not able to take the smell. 


The smell didn’t improve. It just got worse. I wanted to paint, but I couldn’t stand being in that room. I was probably being a bit of a princess, but Cal didn’t have to work in that smell. I thought about the sounds I’d heard the first days. To me, that had sounded like some damn big rats. One of those dying in my wall could definitely stink up a room. But maybe Cal was right after all, maybe it was the downstairs neighbour. I figured I had to talk to that weird guy. At least I’d give it a shot.


After talking myself up, I went to ring his doorbell. As the door cracked open, the smell of stale sweat and catpiss rolled over me. I almost staggered backwards. 


He opened the door just as much as the security chain would allow.


“Um, excuse me sir, I live right upstairs, I just moved in with –“ I cut myself off as I saw him start to slowly close the door. “Sorry, I’ll be fast! It’s just a bit awkward, but there’s kind of a smell in our flat?”


His eyes went wide, but he didn’t say anything. He just stood there, staring at me. The door stopped moving.


“I – uh – my boyfriend suggested that maybe you…” I faltered. His gaze didn’t waver for a moment. 


I stood there for ten seconds, considering whether I should run. In the end, my social conditioning not to be rude took over. I tried again.


“There’s a bit of a weird smell in our apartment, and my boyfriend suggested that you might know something about it.”


His face contorted into a frown. He still didn’t say anything.


“I mean, I don’t know. I – you - ” I was flailing. “Uh, do you know if there are rats in the building?” I finished, defeated.


He smiled.


“No-oo. No rats.” Then he laughed. “Cats!”


“Um, OK, well bye then!” I turned, walking quickly down the hall. The door slammed shut behind me. 


I heard it open again.


“Lady! Maybe you shouldn’t be here, lady!” He called after me. I turned, only to see his door slam shut for the second time. I continued walking, thoroughly unsettled. The door opened again. I didn’t turn around, just started walking faster. “Maybe not so safe, lady! With rats!”


I shuddered, frantically pressing the elevator button over and over. I heard the door click shut behind me. I sighed in relief. I swore to not ever talk to that guy again. Whatever the hell he was doing to make our beautiful flat smell like death, I didn’t want to know it. 


Back in the apartment, the stench had started to spread into the living room. I realized I was scared that Cal would get mad. I knew he thought I had messed something up in the atelier. The idea that I was scared of his reaction unsettled me. He was the love of my life, after all. I decided I was nervous because I wanted him to be happy, that I didn’t want him to be stressed about anything else. I decided I wasn’t scared of him. I loved him, after all.


As I went over our relationship in my head, it hit me that the smell here was completely different from the downstairs apartment. There, it smelled like stale sweat and old cat piss. Here, it smelled like death. “No rats my ass”, I mumbled. I knew a fat rat in the wall was the only explanation.


I figured it was time to call an exterminator. I briefly considered calling Cal to see if he minded, but he had been so mad the last time I called him at work. He thought I was being a princess. I decided I’d just do this on my own, dip into the little money I had left. I couldn’t paint in a room like that. And I was a grown woman, I could handle my own problems. 


I called an exterminator. He referred me to a guy that specializes in getting dead rats out of walls. 


Apparently, that’s a thing.


Lucky for me had a cancellation, so he could come right over. So damn lucky for me…


“Oh yes, you have a dead rat. Probably several. You know this happens sometimes when people put out rat poison. Their nest is probably in you wall, and they crawled back here to die. Don’t worry, I’ll take care of it. I have to cut a hole in the wall, is that OK?”


I frowned, thinking Cal would get mad. But he never goes into the atelier. I figured I could just put a canvas in front of the hole and get it fixed. 


“But don’t worry, hun, with these exposed bricks it’s really easy to patch it back up. Just slap on some mortar and chuck the bricks back in place. Anyone could do it, you wouldn’t be able to tell at all!”


So I told him to go ahead.

I was sitting in the kitchen when the police showed up.


I was sitting in the interrogation room when they told me about the dead body they found behind the wall. 


I was sitting in the lawyer’s office when they told me it was the remains of Cal’s previous girlfriend.


I was sitting in the witness box in the courtroom when they told me he had left her there to die a slow, horrifying death.


I was sitting in the stands when they gave him life without parole for premeditated murder. 


But I was sitting all alone in a cheap motel when I realized that she had still been alive when I moved in.


The building really didn’t have rats.

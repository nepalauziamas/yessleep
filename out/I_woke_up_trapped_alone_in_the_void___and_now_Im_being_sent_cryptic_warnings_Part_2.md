Damned to Hell. 

I thought back to the house fire in the void, and finally began to understand the meaning behind the encounter. This “Reaper” person—he would kill my entire family. This was my “last chance” to save them from damnation. And today was the last day to do it. 

I didn’t understand who The Reaper was or WHAT they were for that matter, but I knew that bad things would happen to my family. Really, REALLY bad things. 

I needed to find them as quick as possible. I had no idea what I could do to help them, but I had to try and that meant that I had to get out of the hospital somehow. 

Ignoring the efforts of the nurse to stop me and the piercing pain in my legs, I got up out of the bed and ripped the IVs from my arms. 

“What do you think you’re doing? You are in no condition to just leave.”
“I have to get to my family. This Reaper guy, he’s going to go after them, and believe me, he will find them no matter what,” I replied, beginning to limp out of the room. 

Unfortunately, the commotion my movement had caused had attracted three more nurses. All four of them together managed to restrain me back in my bed against my protest and struggle. My body was weakened from spending 2 weeks in coma, and I stood no chance against all of them together. 

“How do you know your family’s in danger?” Asked the initial nurse. 

I couldn’t explain the answer, and if I tried, I’d probably be sent to the psych ward. I remained silent. 

“Look,” she said again. “I know you want to see your family, but you can’t go to see them until you are completely recovered. I’m sorry, but there’s no other option.” 

“You’re putting yourself in danger. Keeping me here,” I responded. I knew the Reaper would try to come after me again. He wouldn’t take too kindly to my survival, and if he possessed the power that he had revealed during my coma, he would have absolutely no trouble ending my life and all the lives of these hospital workers. “He’ll come back to finish the job.”

“And believe me. He won’t have any trouble bringing you all down with me.”

“You can’t know this information,” the nurse replied. “You’ve been a coma for two weeks, and there’s no way The Reaper has any way of knowing you’re alive. You’re just delirious. I know you’ve been asleep for two weeks already, but try to get some more. It’ll help.”

“I know what I’m talking about,” I replied, frustrated. “Hell, I know WHO I’m talking about m, believe it or not. And I have to go put a stop to him.” 

I got back up again from the bed, and surprisingly, none of the nurses stopped me. Struggling slightly, I limped past all of them and out the door. When I exited the hospital, I caught a taxi and returned to my home, arriving there at a little after 3 AM. I knew my wife and kids wouldn’t be there, but I hoped they had left some message or something behind for me.

When I got home, I was not disappointed by what I found. There was a letter left behind on the kitchen table when I entered. 
It read: 

We’re all safe. We’re in a place where he will never find us, but you will, Callum. You know the spot.
                                             Love, 
                                             Margaret

I sighed with relief. This was direct confirmation that they were still safe. At least they were when they left. And in a spot that I knew of. 

I had to rack my brain to figure out what she meant by a spot I knew though. It had to have some sentimental value between us if she expected me to remember it. But what location from our past stood out the most?

I had first started dating Margaret 15 years ago. We had gone to a fancy restaurant for our first date, but they couldn’t be hiding in a restaurant. I continued thinking. 

I thought back to our honeymoon in Switzerland. We had stayed in a hotel in Bern and gone boating every sunset around the River Aare. Could they be back there? As I thought some more about it, it seemed like the only likely spot she would be talking about. It was overseas in another country, making it extremely likely for the serial killer to find them. If I was to make it to Switzerland today, I had to leave now to even have a remote chance to stop The Reaper.  Today was the “last chance” and there was no time at all to waste.

My plane left from JFK Airport at 7 AM, and it would land in Bern at around 9:30 PM, giving me 2 and a half hours to put an end to The Reaper. Safely in the air, I finally had time to contemplate what was about to happen. First of all, I had to find my wife and kids to begin with. Next, I’d have to defend them against The Reaper’s attacks. That was the frightening part. I knew he possessed otherworldly powers, and I knew he practically had a perfect kill record. And I thought I could beat him? The first twinges of doubt crept into my mind. 

What if I couldn’t beat him? What if I didn’t even find my family in time? For all I knew, he had already gotten to them, and I was just making his job easier by showing myself to him. I tried desperately to push those thoughts out of my mind. I couldn’t. 

I didn’t even have the memory from his attack on me the first time. I was basing all of my reasonings off of what happened in a coma. For all I knew, he could be way less powerful in real life. And that’s what I had to count on to keep myself from succumbing to my nerves. 

The plane touched down in Bern at precisely 9:00 PM. I waisted no time leaving the airport and catching a tram to the hotel I knew my family would be at. 
I exited the tram at the Bellevue Palace Hotel, the place my wife and I had stayed during our honeymoon 15 years ago. The palace was practically unchanged in those 15 years, and standing back in front of it brought some of my best memories into my head. I couldn’t dwell on me and my wife’s past for long if I wanted to guarantee our long future together though.

I entered the hotel and rang up the front desk, asking if Margaret Peill was staying there. The front desk clerk confirmed that they were there, and after providing proof that I was her husband, I was allowed to visit their room.

When I arrived outside their room, i cautiously knocked on the door, hoping The Reaper hadn’t gotten to them yet. 
“Margaret?” I called out. “Natalie? Samuel? It’s Callum.”

I heard nothing for a solid 30 seconds, and I began to shake. 
And then I heard movement. The door opened just a crack, and I was greeted by my wife’s beautiful but clearly stressed out face. 

When she saw me there, she let out a great sigh of relief and rushed through the door to hug me. Looking over her shoulder, I made eye contact with my 5 year old son, Samuel, and my 10 year old daughter, Natalie. 

They were all okay.

“You’re all ok,” I said. 
She nodded. 
“It’s been so scary. I thought you were gonna die, and then they told us we needed to go hide. So we came back here. I wanted to be somewhere safe, but somewhere you could find us too.” 

I shook my head. 
“We’re not safe here. He knows. He knows we’re here, and he’s come to finish the job. Tonight.”

She gasped. “How did he find us? How do you know he’s found us?”

“Look,” I said, pulling her close to me. “This isn’t just some serial killer. He’s more than that. He’s a demon or something. I saw his power. In my coma, I saw what he was capable of.” 

She didn’t question me, but instead asked, “What do we do?” 

“I—I don’t know, but we either have to kill him for good or survive the night.” 

We scavenged the room for anything that could be used as a weapon but only found a few full kitchen knives. They would have to do.

And then we waited. Hours went by, and I had time to catch up with my wife and children on what had happened after I went into a coma. 

After all events had been covered, we waited in silence. Nerves began to show. My wife and I shook slightly while the kids played in another room, oblivious to what was about to go down.

“You’re sure he’s here?” Margaret asked. 
I nodded. I knew he would come. He just wouldn’t let his prey get away.

And then there was a knock on our room door; we both froze. Cautiously, I got up to open it and was relieved when I found that it was just a hotel worker. 
“Sorry to disturb you,” he said. “but someone’s here to see you.” 
I froze up. It had to be The Reaper. There was no one else we knew in Switzerland. 
“Tell him I’ll be there in a few minutes,” I responded as strongly as I could muster even though I was inwardly terrified. 

When he had left, I turned to my wife.
“This is it,” I said. The fear I felt was revealed through my voice which shook and cracked. 

She nodded, but said, “You don’t have to go down to see him. We can try to delay it as long as possible. There’s only an hour left today.” 

“I know that, but I don’t think we can keep him off for an hour.” 

She sighed, nodding again. “We could run.” 

“No,” I said. “You guys can run. Take the children out the back exit and just go. I’ll find you, but I have to end this here.”

“I can’t let you do that. I’m not leaving you,” she answered, crying softly.

I held her softly. “Think of the children. Trust me. I’ll be okay.” 

I kissed her forehead before sending her in the children out the back exit. Samuel looked back at me as he was pulled towards the exit. “Daddy,” he said. “Why you not coming with us?” 

“I’ve got work to take care of, bud. Just go with your mother and I’ll find you guys in an hour or so.”

My heart broke as I lost sight of them, and real fear fully crept into my body. I was about to see The Reaper again, with no idea of what to expect. I was alone in this. 

I finally wrapped my mind around the situation and mustered up the courage to go to the lobby. I didn’t find what I hoped. I’m fact, I found no one. He wasn’t there. 


It took a second for me to figure out what had happened. He knew I’d take him on alone. He knew I’d sneak my family out. Hell, it was dumb of me to think he didn’t know me, for I had spent two weeks trapped in his mind games. He was specifically going for my family when I wasn’t there to defend them.

“No. Please no,” I cried out. “Take me on alone you WEAK FUCK!”

But he was no where near enough to hear me. I sprinted towards the back exit, screaming for my family to run along the way. When I made it out the door, I found out that I was too late, for there was already a cloaked figure standing over my wife and children. They were all curled up in a group, hiding their faces from the inevitable doom that was looming directly above them.

“Hey!” I screamed out. “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM THEM!” 

He turned towards me, and I caught my first glimpse of his face. It was. . . normal. I don’t know what I expected. Maybe I thought he’d look demonic to some extent, but no. His face resembled that of a stereotypical accountant, but it gleamed with malice as he turned back to look at me. In his left hand, he held a long spear that was the color of pure darkness. It must have been the weapon that sent me to the void. I couldn’t let my family face the same fate.

“Why?” He asked casually. “They’re all going to join me one day. I’m just speeding up the process.” 

He laughed maliciously at his own joke. “At least let me have the child. In my opinion, he’d be cuter with a foot off the top.” 

He laughed again. I practically growled at his murderous joke as shear rage flooded through my head, overpowering my fear. How dare he joke about killing my child. I charged him, and caught him completely off guard, knocking him to the ground. Hard. 

I was pleased to see thick, dark red blood flowing from his head as it struck the rough pavement of the hotel’a back alleyway. Though the injury was severe, it didn’t keep him down for long, and he came back on me stronger than ever. He swung his void-spear wildly and caught my shoulder. I yelled out as black sludge poured out of the wound. My vision began fading, and I knew what the signs meant. In no time, I’d be back in the void house. 

But the fight was yet to end, for my body still contained a small amount of power and willpower. 

“Go!” I screamed out to my family. They listened.

And now The Reaper was back on top of me. I groaned as sludge continued flowing out of my wound. I was fading, but i could take him down with me. 

He began to swing the spear towards my neck, and with my last ditch effort, I managed to grab the blade. It cut deep into my palms, but I was too far gone to feel anymore pain. Holding onto it tightly, I managed to swing it back around on him, slicing into his thigh on the way. He roared with fury and pain. And then I was overcome by the calling of the void.

I was awoken by thick black smoke in the all too familiar bedroom of the void house. Made apparent by the thick smoke, no time had passed since I had last been there nor had the place magically reset itself. 

I knew how to escape this time though. I just had to make it through the flames which, unfortunately, were bound to be larger and hotter than when I had ran through them. 

I didn’t have long to think about the voyage before The Reaper appeared on top of the bed near me. Almost instantly, he caught my eyes and lunged toward me. I stumbled backwards against the bedroom door. I could see flames through its cracks and felt heat radiating against it. We didn’t have time to fight, but The Reaper had not been made aware of this. He came at me again, swinging his fists wildly since his spear had not come with him. He landed one against my jaw, causing blood to spray out where it then landed against the heated door. It began to sizzle on impact. 

I swung my fists back desperately while also making a sorry attempt to open the door. When I finally turned the handle, the metal burned deeply into my palm, but I had no time to show any signs of pain. A wave of flames engulfed us the second the door was opened. I stumbled out of it, getting to my feet and running towards the front door. I couldn’t see anything, but I knew the location of everything. 

As I ran, the pain began to overcome my adrenaline, and the burning of my skin almost overcame my willpower. I could feel my legs growing weak, but I pressed on. 

Finally, I made it to the door and carried my momentum through it, and once again, I plunged into the eternal-but-not-so-eternal void.

I woke up smoldering in the alleyway behind the Bellevue. Beside me still lay The Reaper who was light up like a cannibal birthday cake. His spear lay between us. I waisted no time in picking it up. With a roar of fury, I shoved it deep into his chest. I had no idea what effect that would have on his soul, but I could care less. He was gone and my family was safe at last. And now, I just had to find them and continue our lovely vacation.

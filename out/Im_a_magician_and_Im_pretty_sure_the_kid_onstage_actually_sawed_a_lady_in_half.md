A paranormal circus wasn’t really my kind of thing, but I didn’t have any performances that evening and an anonymous benefactor had sent me a front-row ticket.

The sparkling black-and-purple circus tent was packed with people. I admit that I can be a bit skittish sometimes, and the macabre costumes of the undead clowns that would roam the aisles startled me an embarrassing number of times, but the show was a spectacle well worth the scares. The acts were at once chilling and captivating. I found myself holding my breath as the vampiric knife-thrower stabbed silver blades dangerously close to her prey, and gasped with the rest of the audience when the ghoulish acrobats clung precariously to each other in their aerial act.

Among the extravagantly dangerous performances, though, the show-stopper was none other than the circus magician.

Small and lean and dressed in a purple satin suit, the magician didn’t look any older than seventeen or eighteen. It wasn’t uncommon for young prodigies to enter the performance scene so early, but something about him was different. He exuded a kind of confidence that most wouldn’t learn to have until well into their career, and wore a slightly crooked smile that made him at once charming and dangerous.

As for his tricks, they were nothing short of breathtaking. With a wave of his hand, he turned the flowing purple drapes around the aerial silk dancer into fluttering rose petals and effortlessly caught the dancer in his arms. He called a volunteer to the stage, whispered something in his ear, and made him dance like a puppet on its strings. At one point he simply walked onstage and snapped his fingers, instantly engulfing himself in deep violet flames that rose high into the air before slowly sputtering out as he took a small bow, completely unscathed.

I rarely found much of a challenge in puzzling out the secrets of other magicians’ routines, since my own familiarity with magic usually made it easy to reason out how others would craft their own tricks. The silk turning into petals was a work of clever setup and practiced timing backstage. The volunteer who got hypnotized was most likely planted there. And while a full-body burn was a bold move, these circus performers were probably used to risking their lives daily.

I only began to suspect something was strange when the young magician began to perform a classic stage trick. A slender lady accompanied him onstage and lowered herself into a long wooden crate.

Conventionally, the crate would be placed on a specially designed table, but the table onstage was plain.

The crate was also commonly wide enough to fold the body into, but this one was a tight fit.

The feet sticking out of one side of the crate wouldn’t usually move, but these bobbed as the lady adjusted herself.

Mildly impressed, I was beginning to think of what clever trick the young magician had devised when the giant carpenter’s saw bit deep into the crate and the lady began to scream.

I gripped the edges of my seat and told myself it was just an act as the magician hacked into the crate. The screams grew louder and more frantic, and the crate rattled as the lady twisted in what appeared to be pain, her feet twitching spastically. Thick red blood began to pool underneath the crate.

The magician didn’t so much as blink. His blade and now his hand were stained, and blood dripped from the table as he relentlessly drew the saw back and forth, back and forth. The audience was silent and the lady just kept screaming, until there was an audible *crunch* and she went completely still.

That was a lot of fake blood. I wondered if they had concealed a jug of it somewhere. They must have gotten assistance from some big-shot Hollywood artists to get the black bits and chunks in there.

The magician put down his saw and turned the severed halves of the crate towards us to see. The audience gasped and murmured at the very realistic-looking torso-halves. I peered into the crate itself. Other than the grotesque severed body, it seemed to be empty and plain.

The magician swiveled the crate-halves back together and smiled. His eyes glittered strangely as he took in the suspense. Then he placed his hands on the crate, closed his eyes, and simply breathed for several long moments.

The lady’s eyes snapped open. The audience cheered wildly as the magician opened the crate, helped her to her feet, tidied her now blood-soaked dress, and led her offstage.

As the lights dimmed and the stagehands swooped in to clean up the props, I could have sworn I caught the metallic scent of blood.

Of all the people who could come up to me, I was intercepted by a demonic clown on my way out.

He smiled wide with slit lips and jagged teeth, gesturing for me to follow.

“I don’t really need more pictures,” I said.

He kept gesturing. I let out a small sigh and followed him through the crowd to one of the side exits. We stepped out into the night and he began to lead me around the back of the circus tent.

“Where are we going?” I asked, beginning to grow uneasy.

The clown just smiled back at me.

I followed as far behind him as I could without seeming rude, which really wasn’t very far at all. Before I knew it, we were removed from the crowds at the very back of the circus yard littered with swampy puddles from the afternoon’s rain. Square black tents about the size of typical New York bedrooms occupied the grounds. The clown turned to me and pointed at one.

“You want me to… go inside?”

He nodded.

I swallowed. The clown stepped back in a comically exaggerated manner, as if to pantomime to me his intent not to harm me. Somewhat encouraged by this, I stepped up to the tent and gingerly brushed the drapes aside.

Sitting in the tent at a table with two slender wineglasses, surrounded by glittering yellow fairy lights strung along the walls, was the young magician.

Upon seeing me, he smiled, got to his feet, and held out his hand.

“Mr. Herring,” he said. “A pleasure to finally meet you.”

In retrospect, it was incredibly rude of me to not shake his hand, but hearing him speak for the first time combined with the fact that he knew my name caught me off guard. I blinked, dumbfounded.

“You know me?”

“Of course. From the Bellagio escape act, right?”

“Ah,” I felt myself blush a little. “That was a long time ago.”

“Certainly not long enough to forget. Please, come in. I’ve always wanted to speak to you.”

Somewhat awkwardly, I took my seat at the table across from the young magician. The clown walked in carrying a tall bottle.

“I do hope you like champagne.”

I raised an eyebrow. “Are you old enough to…?”

The magician laughed. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”

“Ah, apologies.”

“No, no, it’s really fine.”

As I sipped the rose-colored champagne, I couldn’t help but study the young magician’s face. Some of his stage makeup was still on, making his angled jawline and high cheekbones stand out. He wore unsettlingly vivid purple contacts that were covered only by the tips of his long thick eyelashes.

He certainly didn’t look old enough for any of this.

“Forgive me,” he said quickly, noticing my staring. “I don’t believe I’ve introduced myself. My name is Alexander Chase. On the stage they call me The Mirage.”

Hearing those words rang a bell at the back of my mind. I had probably heard some of my colleagues talk about him.

“The Mirage,” I echoed. “That’s in the name of the show, isn’t it? The Mirage Carnival.”

Alexander smiled. “Yes. This is my show.”

“That’s very impressive. Leading an entire circus troupe.”

“Thank you very much. I couldn’t have done it without you.”

“Without me?”

“You inspired me to begin performing. The Bellagio escape struck a deep chord, and since then I’ve followed all of your work. I’ve always wanted to be like you.”

This was completely unexpected. I could feel myself swell with pride.

“I dare say you may have already surpassed me,” I said. “The tricks today were very impressive.”

“You don’t know how much those words mean to me, Mr. Herring.”

“Please, just call me Bryan.”

Alexander smiled. “Bryan.”

The way his tongue formed the sounds sent a quiet chill down my spine. In his voice, my own name became mysterious and dangerous.

I was startled off my train of thought when a dozen heavy footsteps broke through the nighttime air, sprinting towards the tent.

“What is that?”

Alexander cursed. “They found me.”

“Who-”

“Quiet.”

More footsteps scrambled to meet the disturbance. There were shouts of alarm and a loud, resounding *crack*.

I looked to Alexander. He narrowed his eyes at the drapes covering the entrance to the tent. The commotion drew closer with every second.

A spray of gunfire tore through the grounds.

“Run,” Alexander said. “Don’t let them see you.”

Before I could process what he said, he grabbed me by the wrist, turned to the back wall of the tent, and swept his other hand through the air. The black fabric wall rippled and peeled open like a flower blooming.

“W-what…”

He waved his hand and the fairy lights blinked out, plunging us into the night. As the last of the glow faded, I thought I saw him take something small and shiny from his pocket and toss it on the floor. Then he leaped out through the hole in the wall, yanking me through behind him, and began to run.

“Alexander-”

“I said quiet,” he snapped in a hushed tone. “And call me Alex.”

Voices shouted behind us, the heavy thudding of boots in pursuit. Another round of gunfire tore through the air. I almost dropped to my knees and scrambled for cover, but Alex kept me running.

We ran out of the circus yard through a break in the fence and onto muddy dirt roads. My joints cramped up and I almost slipped and fell several times, but my adrenaline kept me going. I risked one look behind us but saw nothing in the dark. Police sirens wailed in the distance.

“Bryan,” Alex said.

“Huh?”

“We’re going to jump.”

I strained to see the ground in front of us. Closing in fast was a puddle spanning the entire width of the road, filled with muddy rainwater.

“Wait, Alex-”

“Jump.”

Something in his voice instantly compelled me to leap into the air, hurtling straight for the puddle. I yelped and held out my free hand, bracing myself for a face-first impact into inch-deep mud.

Then we broke the surface and sank deep into the cold murky water.

It was dark. I couldn’t see anything. I was somehow submerged from head to toe, tiny bubbles swirling around me like I had just dove into a pool. I stretched my legs downwards but couldn’t feel the bottom.

Alex squeezed my wrist.

Buried in the sounds of rushing water, I could hear my crashing heartbeat. I held my breath and long seconds passed, until we heard the sounds of boots splashing through shallow puddles directly above us. Then they were gone.

Alex swam upwards, pulling me along. We broke the surface and pulled ourselves onto a strangely smooth and supple floor.

As I caught my breath, soft yellow light flooded the small cubical space. We were back in Alex’s tent, surrounded by fairy lights. Alex’s purple satin suit was dry, and so were my clothes. There was no trace of water on the floor.

There was a *click* behind us.

We turned to see the man in full body armor and a helmet with a reflective visor. He held a pistol pointed at Alex.

Embroidered on his jacket was a patch that read *NSF*.

“Come peacefully,” he said. Perhaps I was mistaken, but his voice sounded like he was shaking. His pistol wavered, trained between Alex’s eyes.

Alex chuckled.

“Ah, you’ve got me. I really didn’t want to put Bryan Herring in danger, but you just had to choose today to storm my town.”

The armored man’s finger trembled on the trigger. He began to reach for the radio at his hip.

I swallowed. “Alex…”

“Now that you’ve seen Bryan with me, I guess it’s gotta be either you or him. Easy choice.”

Alex snapped his fingers. Deep violet flames sprang out of thin air and engulfed the man.

I gasped and scrambled away as the man’s armor caught fire like kindling. Wild gunshots rang out, but the bullets went wide as he twisted and screamed, the flames slowly consuming him.

Alex stood still, watching. A thin smile tugged at his lips. His eyes flickered with the flames, barely concealing something deadly behind them.

I cowered in the corner, only watching because I couldn’t tear my eyes away.

There was no heat to the flames, and instead of the stench of burning flesh, the sweet aroma of roses filled the air. The burning lump of a man crumpled to the floor. Slowly, the screaming diminished to small choking sounds, and after what felt like an eternity, it was quiet.

The flames flickered out. There was nothing left but a smudge of soot on the tent floor.

“Alex,” I whispered. As the adrenaline sputtered, a million questions filled my head.

The young magician let out a small, contented sigh.

“Alex,” I managed, this time loud enough to be heard. I was trembling. “You killed someone.”

“It was you or him, Bryan.”

“How?”

“They saw you with me, which put you in danger. I don’t want you to live my life of being pursued. Not that you could survive long.”

“But…”

He turned to me and put a finger to his lips. “No more.”

"Alex, I really need some answers."

He stared me down with his unsettling gaze. I don’t know what came over me, but I refused to falter. After a few tense moments, his eyes softened.

“One question,” he said.

I thought hard, but the million questions overlapped and echoed in an unbearably confusing chorus.

In the end, I could really only ask one question.

“You’re not human, are you?”

Alex smiled. He held out his hand and pulled me to my feet. I looked down at him now, waiting.

“No,” he said simply.

I nodded.

“It’s time for you to go,” he said. “I would love to spend more time with you, really get to talk, but… not today.”

“Will I see you again?”

“One question.”

I pursed my lips.

“When you get home, no telling anyone and no calling the police. Got it?”

I nodded, again.

“It was a true honor meeting you, Bryan. Something I’d looked forward to for years.”

Alex stood on the tips of his toes and leaned in close to my ear.

“Now, be on your way.”

I don’t remember anything after that.

==========

When I came to, I was lying in bed in my house. I had a pounding headache, and I wasn’t sure what day or time it was. It felt like I had been asleep for a long time.

A quick look around the house revealed that the power cord on my landline phone was cut and the antennae on my Internet router broken off. On my kitchen table was a sticky note with something written on it. Albeit shaky, I could recognize my own handwriting.

*1. No telling anyone*

*2. No calling the police*

It's an unpleasant surprise to most that there is less security between the supernatural and us than you'd see in a bank. Well now, I suppose there's nothing between me and the supernatural, not anymore. No beige walls, no tough looking guards, and no electronic locks. Now, I am part of it. 
Saturday was supposed to be my next entry in this journal of mine but I couldn't find my laptop, my notebook, shit I barely found my toothbrush. I'm also in the hospital, I'll explain later. It doesn't help that it took me several hours to become aware of who I really was, again I'll explain later. Saturday was also the first day of testing. I was unaware that we could be called in by our bosses at this gig, that was until I got a call from my suited friends telling me there was a "dire emergency". I overheard something else about a possible "XK-Class" or something but I couldn't try to guess what that meant. Probably just those nerds at the lab playing Dungeons and Dragons… Not that that's a bad thing.

The emergency call was around noon, I was told I had 5 minutes to be at the randevu point. When I asked what a "randevu" was, they hung up on me. Assuming it meant "downstairs in uniform" I threw on the cheap tracksuit they gave me and sprinted to the elevator. Sure it was only one floor down and I was in a rush so maybe the stairs would be faster, however my comfort was far more important to my lazy body at the time.

I did make it out just in time, though. I wasn't shocked by my ride. The windowless black van had only one distinguishing feature. It was the white silhouette of a stag beetle on the sliding door, something I somehow only noticed as it opened. 
 Inside sat two men in suits, a sight I guessed I'd have to get used to soon. "This my Uber?" I failed to joke. They just stared at me, and one tapped the face of his watch slowly with an index finger, displaying it to me like I was a dumb kid. I guess at that moment, I was. 

I stopped my forced laughter and hopped into the van. The back of this vehicle was closer to a limo than anything. It's nice comfortable seats faced inward, leaving me face to face with the suits. I tried to make small talk and failed miserably. Every time I said something they just… Kept looking forward. No words, at least not until I spoke for a third time, asking "So what's up with this XK Class thingy? I overhear-" 

"That is not your job, nor is it your place to know." I was cut off and quickly realized questions will either get me in trouble or nowhere. I was reminded of how potentially serious the situation I'd gotten into really was. I couldn't be nosy and ask questions, especially not ones I didn't want or need the answers to. Eyes on the prize. I was getting paid well, I didn't want to mess this up. At least, that's how I felt until I got to that building.

 It gave off this weird energy, like something inhuman was contained within and somehow calling out to me, to any living thing that would listen. It was begging for help. Crying in ways that no human ever could. It wasn't long before my pause was interrupted by two strong hands pushing me. 
"You're not here for sightseeing. Get moving." The guard behind me sounded pissed. Understandable enough, I guess. The walkway up to the building was nothing more than a dirt path that others had walked on. That's when I realized the lot we were in was somehow in the middle of nowhere, I mean I couldn't see another building. Mind you, I live dead center in a big town and we drove less than 10 minutes to what felt like going 35 with no more than a few bumps.

The doors and building looked like a small town bank. Biggest difference being the key-card lock that automatically unlocked as we approached the door. It was like a proximity sensor. I looked around for cameras on the way in and was surprised to see none. Not a single camera in this building. Weird. Top secret organizations tend to keep track of that stuff. 

The room we entered was tiny. A small room with metal lockers, maybe 10 or so all lined up on a wall. Each locker had a number, but no name. I was led to locker 4,  it was the last one in the room on the right, right next to locker 6. They all opened simultaneously, just an inch. "One minute, put your shit in the locker." Said the same guard from before. I didn't have anything on me, figured there was no use, so I just spent the minute looking around. Not much to see, unfortunately I couldn't feed any of my curiosity. Just some cheap looking beige wallpaper. 

After a minute there was a shrill dissonant sound, it reminded me of a fire alarm but thankfully it just signified the closing of the lockers and nothing else. They all slammed shut with a ferocity I felt might take my finger off. I left my empty locker behind to follow the suited men through a door I didn't notice before. Wonder how I missed it. 

I had more on my mind now, though. That strange building kept getting stranger. It smelled like… Almost like the produce aisle in a grocery store… And just like the lobby, the hall I was being into was so oddly barren. No doors save for one that looked tremendously far away. It had the same beige walls, too. I couldn’t understand the space this building occupied. I could have sworn the outside wasn’t long enough to harbor such a long stretch. Then all at once the dread, fear, and regret hit me. Whatever was in front of me was not natural. It did not belong in this world. I could tell that just by seeing this spatial oddity. 

The first step just felt wrong. So very wrong. I placed one foot in front of the other, then propelled my body what I could have sworn was only a short step forward. When I did I found myself a quarter of the way down the hall dizzy and confused. The space the hall occupied, and now the space I occupied, made no logical sense. Then again, neither did the machine or experiments I was being led to. 

In a few more short steps I was already at the end, my hand on the doorknob. It was ice cold to the touch. But something about this whole thing felt wrong… What was it? What was I missing? Something besides this long hallway and impossible space and the terrible oddity before me was getting under my skin. I turned around to ask my guard buddy if something was wrong here, and he was gone. Then I fell. The impossible room fell away. The odd smell didn’t as I fell through that void. It felt like I'd slammed into the Earth from free fall when I woke up. My vision was blurry, and I was holding a fresh looking apple, checking if it was stale. That’s right, I was shopping. I needed to buy food. My roommates had cleared everything out this week and my friends were coming over. I at least wanted them to have something to snack on in case they got too drunk. Suddenly I’d forgotten all about myself. “Dave” must’ve been a daydream. A very, very, vivid one. I had those a lot. 

Physiatrists and doctors couldn’t quite explain it. One minute, I’d be, well I’d be me, and the next while my body went on total autopilot, I was someone else. I wasn't a danger. I'd never hurt anyone. It helped to say my name aloud to myself when it happened. “Samuel.” I might have looked a little dumb standing there mumbling my own name just audibly enough for the people around me to hear, but I didn’t mind. If it was to keep me grounded it was worth it. I think that strange daydreaming was the same reason I misplaced so many things. You see lately I’d even manage to lose food, somehow. One minute I’d have a sandwich with a bite taken out sitting on my desk, the next it would be gone. I wondered just how much time passed when I noticed something had vanished from my desk or table. 

I was spacing out again. I pulled out my phone to check my list, I wasn’t sure how much I’d gotten done. Looking in my shopping cart, it looked like a good bit of it. I started to mumble to myself to confirm I hadn’t gotten anything wrong in the few items. “Eggs, yep.” Each item list was a small glance upward back at my card. “Milk, yep. Cereal, yep. Oreos, uh-” I cut myself off, looking back at the list almost by instinct but quickly corrected my vision right back to the small layered cart. I liked the small ones, they were more fun to drift. 

But more importantly the potentially endless fun I could have with a driftable cart, was that something was missing. The Eggs were gone. One second they were there, the next, nothing. I hadn’t moved. I only looked away for a second. I thought I’d seen a hand near the Oreos, too but no one was around. I was shocked. Someone so fast they could move without me noticing them completely silently just stole my eggs right next to an aisle with more eggs. They still had to pay for them. It wasn’t like they made off with some amazing haul. They tried for the Oeros, too. There was no sense to it. I guess it’s when I started noticing it. 

Something couldn’t have been right. While we were unpacking I asked one of the more observant roommates of the 3 I lived with. “You notice stuff going missing lately?” See Joe and I didn’t talk too much, and when we did it was important. So when I broke one of our longer records of silence he looked up at me with concern. I could almost see myself in that shocked expression of his. “Whadd’ya mean?” His genuine surprise was definitely not hidden by the southern accent. “Well,” I said “Today at the store–I swear I’m not fucking around, I saw, or I guess didn’t see, the Eggs I put in the card disappear. They just–” 

I was cut off, I was used to that. “It was probably a hallucination, man.” He said before I could finish my short story.  That’s the worst part about this kinda stuff. No one believes you when something actually happens. Understandably so, but still. I wish I could be normal. I bet if I were that hallucination, 'Dave', that daydreamt fantasy man I'd pretend to be sometimes, someone would believe me. 
At least I knew if something was going on, with all of us here in this same room, tonight someone would actually see it and tell me it was real. That it wasn't a piece of fiction I'd made up for myself. The first 'missing item' was when we were all sitting around my dining room table playing Cards Against Humanity. I don't know if I can write the jokes we were making here but one of them led to a drunk friend of mine, Tom, pacing in circles around my living room, yelling at all of us as he pretended to be an Estate Salesmen, that was until he froze. His face went from that of faux drunken anger, to one devoid of all energy. He was just staring. Staring right at the table. 

As synchronized as 3 drunk people could be, we turned our heads slowly to his line of sight. What we say forever changed my world view, as I'm sure it did the others there. A salt shaker was… crawling. It's legs? I think legs were moving too fast to see as it darted in circles around the table, seemingly looking for an escape. We all tried to grab it, trap it, but we couldn't seem to get it. It didn't help me one bit that for some reason, I supposed at the time my drunkness, my fingers on my left hand weren't moving. I could still feel them but… I'm left hand dominant too so it was a real pain in the ass to try and pull this off with just five floppy digits and my right hand. As it came back around to me I slammed my right hand down, just barely missed it, and it made what I can only assume was a calculated juke for my left side, jumping straight down off the table. 

In my drunken haze, I couldn't possibly keep up visually or otherwise. All I saw was it going under my fridge. How it fit under there is still beyond me, even with what we found out later that part doesn't add up. "So uhh… Anyone else can't move their body parts? Cause my fingers don't work." I asked the room as if we hadn't just seen a salt shaker spider.

 "You're jus' drunk!" spouted Barney as he wobbly tried to sit up straight. "Y'know" slurred Tom "I bet if we move the fridge we can fin-find that thing." Even Joe's eyes lit up at the idea. I think we all, even in spite of our profound drunkness, had a deep curiosity about the oddity we'd just witnessed. 

We all stumbled our way over, Tom the dramatic man he is, was walking as if his foot didn't work at all. Joe and I hobbled the fridge while Tom and Barney floated over our shoulders, looking the same place we were, right below the fridge. "What the fuck is that‽" Barney yelled, making noise before any of us as soon as the nightmare came into vision. 
It looked like it went in forever, this deep hole below my fridge. But it was big enough for a person. It was perfectly square, as if it had been cut with machine precision. As the chasm went it expanded, like we were looking down into a great pyramid with no bottom. To top it off we were on the third floor. Unfortunately, though, the oddly familiar confusion of impossible space wasn't the bad part. 

I could deal with a supernatural hole under my fridge, but that had disembodied limbs growing from the walls. It had to be thousands, mostly fingers, toes, feet, and hands but occasionally parts of heads and mouths I knew were down there thanks to a collective groan. "Hey! Turn that damn light off!" One of the heads closer to the top yelled. "Yeah!" replied another as we were jeered by countless voices. "What the hell are you guys?" I yelled down, suddenly my friends spokesperson. "Whaddya think? We're people just like you! And we don't want some jerk moving our door!" A head yelled back at me from I couldn't tell where. 

"Guys," I started, suddenly feeling very sober, "I think at least right now we should listen to 'em. Who knows what they can do." I spoke quietly enough the heads had no way to hear, still looking into the hole. Now that I looked closer, it seemed like the further down they were, the more body parts they had. A few rows down were heads, then partial torsos and even one with an arm. I couldn't see past those ones though. 

Their replies were just as magically sober as mine. "Yeah." Joe mumbles. "Uh-huh that works while we figure out what this is" replied Tom. Then behind our small huddle came a new voice, a childlike impersonation of a stranger. It was high pitched, as if a young man was trying to make a 'girl voice'. "Yeah! They might be real jerks!" Turning around to face it we saw the fridge. It stood on two legs, boxing us in. On it's sides near the front were two arms. On its-face? The top door, it was one of those older white fridges before time turned it yellow, was a familiar face. The face of Barney. Not his entire face, just his eyes, nose, and mouth. The fridge looked like an annoying orange character. That's when we collectively noticed Barney was not in our huddle. The fridge must've removed him. 

Then, after way too much unbroken eye contact and heavy breathing, the fridge charged. We tried to push back, but with my fingers not working, and Tom's weird foot thing, there wasn't much we could do. Joe was a smaller guy anyways, we all were besides Barney and he wasn't here so there wasn't much of a chance to begin with. 

We got pushed back, losing our sumo wrestling match with a fridge meant falling. Again today I was falling, watching the world I thought I understood move away from my view. 
Oh shit. Doctors are getting here now. I'll explain why I'm in the hospital next time, a lot happened this week.  Until next time.

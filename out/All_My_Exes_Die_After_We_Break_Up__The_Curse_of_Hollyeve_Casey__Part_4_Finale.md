Casey and I watched as Colin held that knife at his neck with it trembling in his hand, eventually slightly driving the sharp blade into his soft skin.

“Give me both parts of the necklace!” Colin screamed up at us. 

I followed Colin’s frightened eyes and saw that they were looking behind us. 

I whipped around and for the quickest of seconds I saw a charred figure standing right behind Casey and I. I then saw that figure rush at Casey. 

I couldn’t react fast enough to help Casey. Hollyeve’s apparition knocked him down the stairs and I watched him tumble down about 20 steps until he landed at Colin’s feet. 

I could feel a cold wind rush at me next but I hurried down the stairs and was able to avoid it. 

My foot caught one of the steps awkwardly and twisted, tripping me and sending me down the stairs just like Casey. In a flash, I was at the bottom, back with Colin and I could see he had dropped his knife down to his waist. Casey was on the ground between us - knocked out. 

“You can’t take it from me. You can’t take her from me,” Colin whispered to me as he stood above me. 

“What?” I asked and looked back up the stairs - seeing Hollyeve’s apparition standing there, swaying at the top. 

“I don’t want to let go of her,” Colin went on. 

I went to look back at Colin and just as I did, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Hollyeve fly down the entire flight of stairs in a blink - gliding on air. 

I found myself between the two of them. I looked up and saw them staring into each other’s eyes. 

Suddenly the newfound strength Colin had found started to vanish. He started to tremble and step away from Hollyeve. 

She held out her hand and motioned for him to give her something. 

I could feel something radiating out of Hollyeve. It was a sadness. No longer anger. A yearning to be set free. 

It prompted a revelation in me. I think she was able to plant there as I sat at her feet. 

*It was not Hollyeve who was holding on.* ***It was Colin.***

I looked up into Hollyeve’s burning eyes and memories that were not mine flooded into my mind. 

*I was with Hollyeve on that property - out in the woods - in the middle of the night. I was pressed up against a tree by a young Colin - his eyes soft and kind as he moved in to kiss me delicate on the lips. There was no denying it felt true.* 

I then looked into Colin’s eyes from the ground. They were burning just like Hollyeve’s. 

*I was transported back to that moment in the woods - looking at a younger, fuller, Hollyeve, who I saw smile for the very first time. She was a different person as young Colin was with her there and he uttered those three dangerous little words - “I love you.”* 

Still on the floor, I watched fat tears start to drop out of Colin’s eyes. 

*Another memory started to come to me. I was now out in the field outside of the house, looking at an older, more rustic version of the building we were currently in, resting on a moonlit night in a soft wind, ignited in flame.* 

*I watched young Hollyeve dash across the field and disappear into the house.* 

*Then I was inside the house, barely able to see through all the smoke, but I still saw Hollyeve rushing through her old bedroom, searching for something. Lost in the smoke, coughing, and slowing, she wasn’t finding it and she was succumbing to the smoke.* 

*It wasn’t long before she dropped to the hardwood floor, but she also got what she came for. Clutched in her hand was that half heart necklace Colin had given her.* 

I was back on the floor as well, looking up at Colin and Hollyeve’s spirit - locked in a stare. 

“I came back to your house to tell you I wanted to be with you. I had changed my mind,” Colin said to Hollyeve. “I just didn’t get there in time.”

*I was back in the burning house again in a memory that wasn’t mine. I looked out the window and saw a young Colin running through the field outside, making his way to the house in a full on sprint.* 

Back on the floor, out of the memory, I was still looking at Colin cry above me. 

“You don’t believe me?” Colin asked Hollyeve. 

She shook her head. *No.* 

Colin reached out and put his hands softly on Hollyeve’s forehead and I was transported back to the memory. 

*I was inside the house, the flames licking at me, I could feel their heat on me, and I could barely see because of the smoke all around. Yet, I could see Colin frantically searching the house - making his way up to Hollyeve’s bedroom.* 

*I heard him call out for her - his voice breaking with sadness and panic. He kept screaming and screaming.* 

*What he didn’t know yet, I could already see - Hollyeve on the ground, the flames already to her, consuming her not far from me on the floor.* 

*I think the smoke took out Hollyeve and she couldn’t even feel her body being consumed with flames, thankfully. She didn’t scream in pain, she just laid there and succumbed.* 

*And Colin still had no idea, he moved through the smoke calling for her, coughing, and nearly succumbing himself.* 

*He could feel it though. I could feel him scream out in pain as flames caught him, eventually catching his clothes on fire.* 

*I watched him get taken by the flames and collapse next to me - I saw his blue eyes shining through the smoke as they laid upon Hollyeve, fully aflame, just a handful of feet from him.* 

*I watched tears fall from those eyes as he slipped away.* 

Back in the room, I watched Colin strip his shirt off and reveal extensive scarring over a good portion of his torso. The sight seemed to soften Hollyeve. She looked at the scars all over his chest and back and her eyes started to wet. 

“I came back for you,” Colin said softly. 

*Back in the burning house in the memory - I watched firefighters rush in and take Colin away just as he passed out.* 

*They didn’t get Hollyeve. She was left there to burn.* 

The memories drifted away and I felt myself completely in the moment on the floor, looking up at Colin and Hollyeve. 

“You never stay,” Colin said to Hollyeve. 

I felt Hollyeve communicate back to him silently - *You want me to stay?*

*I was back in memories. This time in what appeared to be Colin’s teenage bedroom. Him clutching that half heart necklace, rubbing it with his thumb, looking at a mirror as he sees the image of Hollyeve’s apparition for just a second.* 

*His face lights up. He squeezes the half heart necklace. Then she’s gone. And his face falls flat.* 

“I kept trying to find ways to find you,” Colin explained. 

*Back in Colin’s memories. We were in a cheap motel room with a sex worker. They were kissing, but he looked hesitant.* 

*He kept looking at the mirror - clearly trying to find something. The sex worker noticed and grew wary. She pulled away from him.* 

*“What is this? You have someone watching you or something?” The sex worker asked Colin.* 

*Just as she finished her question - the image of Hollyeve flashed in the mirror Colin was looking at.* 

*The sex worker saw Colin’s eyes light up and then her’s followed his until…*

*She caught a glimpse of Hollyeve in the mirror.* 

*The sex worker screamed and pushed away Colin. Then she rushed out of the room.* 

“I paid for love because it was the only way I could connect with you. I couldn’t date regular girls anymore because you always chased them away. Then you even chased away the paid ones, and I had to go yet another route,” Colin said. 

*The memories kicked back in and I was in a dark strip club with Colin watching him hand over $20 bills to a stripper looking beyond exhausted.* 

“The strip clubs were a public enough space that you didn’t seem to terrorize the girls and I would get to see you,” Colin went on. 

*In the strip club, I could see Colin getting a lap dance. Across the little space sat Hollyeve.*

“But now I’m almost out of money. That’s why I came here tonight. My last chance to maybe keep seeing you,” Colin said. 

I blinked deliberately a bunch of times and was able to get myself out of the memory and back into the house, looking up at Colin and Hollyeve, eyes still locked on each other. 

Hollyeve slowly reached out her open palm, upwards, wanting something. Colin balked. Clearly not wanting to give it up. 

She just kept her hand there. Kept her eyes sad and haunting. 

Still, Colin didn’t give in. 

I watched Hollyeve’s mouth move, but no words came out. Yet, I could tell exactly the single word she mouthed to him. 

*Please.* 

I watched Colin think about it for a few more moments, then hand over his half of the half heart necklace. 

“I’m sorry,” he muttered. “It’s crazy to say now, but I did love you back then.”

Hollyeve moved towards Colin. He flinched for a second. 

She wrapped him in a strong hug. A long one. They held there for a little while. He just kept saying he was sorry over and over and over again. 

Eventually Colin was standing there all by himself. 

*Hollyeve was gone.* 

—

I got Casey up and got the three of us out of there. 

Colin told us he did feel like he could finally live life now before he walked into his apartment. 

I didn’t really believe him. 

\-

I wasn’t sure if things really worked out for Colin or not. He never appeared on the Curse of Hollyeve subreddit.

The rest of the group started to reappear though. Everyone was noting that Hollyeve seemed to have gone away. 

I noticed it too. I went a long time without any kind of encounter or even vibe from her. I swear I used to frequently feel a lingering presence around me when I was alone, and it was gone. 

Eventually some members of the group even started talking about successfully dating. No longer getting issues and attacks from Hollyeve. They were finally finding love. 

\-

I gave it some time and I told Katy about what happened and we felt it was okay for us to part ways. We got divorced as quickly as we could. 

I started to branch out myself once we separated. A few days ago I set up a dating app profile. 

Then earlier today I started skimming through profiles - sending likes and messages. 

I was elated when I received my first “Like” from someone. I raced to find out who she would be. 

I haven’t looked at the profile yet. The name was enough to get me to close the app…

***Hollyeve***

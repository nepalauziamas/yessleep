So, so far these entries have been getting increasingly weird. But at the very least I have the consolation that Thelma didn't go all 'It's A Good Life' on Blackthorne. It's a very normal town and there are no signs that a creepy child with psychic powers ever inhabited it. I'm even considering not turning this thing in. Maybe it was just the work of some lunatic, or a prank.

Pretty elaborate prank, though. And if it was the work of some lunatic who planted the diary in my backyard, an escaped lunatic is still something to be concerned about, without a doubt.

As you can tell, my conscience won't leave me alone about this particular matter.

But anyway, here are entries 5 and 6. The seventh and final entry will be posted soon, I assure you.

*November 7, 1961*

*I've decided to run away. Everyone in this stupid town stinks except Violet, and even she doesn't want to run away with me! But she did pinky swear to not tell anyone about me running away, so she's still okay, I guess.*

*I told Momma, Daddy and Polly about me running away. And you know what they said?*

*Momma said, "That's nice, dear." I told her I meant it, and she told me to have fun. Honestly, sometimes you can never tell whether they're listening or not. Daddy said, "No, you're not." I told him I was and he just said he'd beat me if I tried. But I'm gonna be extra sneaky and use my powers to make myself invisible and make sure no one hears me.*

*Polly said "Send me a postcard." I don't know why she wanted me to, but she's the worst sister in the world, so I'm not going to.*

*I'm not sure what I'm going to pack yet, but Grandma, Aunt Frances and Aunt Katherine came over today. I don't like them either. Grandma's old and wrinkly and smells like vinegar and she's always spitting on tissues and wiping my face with them. And the candy in her handbag is a hundred and fifty six years old, just like her.*

*Aunt Frances always asks me about everything and calls me rude when I don't answer. And Aunt Katherine is mean and always insisting on rules everywhere. Rules are boring.*

*At dinnertime, I got the worst of all three of them. Grandma wiped my face with spit tissues, Aunt Katherine yelled at me about elbows on the table and talking with my mouth full, even though I had no choice because Aunt Frances was being a nosy parker about everything! I had to lie to her, too, because she kept asking about my day at school and if I told her the truth, that I had spent the entire day dreading her and Grandma's and Aunt Katherine's visit, I'd get a real good beating.*

*I decided to use my powers on them after I heard Momma complaining to Daddy how hard it was to have two big sisters. I've already got one; I can't imagine her pain. So I made Aunt Katherine and Aunt Frances disappear - or, more accurately, 'sent them to the cornfield' - and wiped out memories and traces. As for Grandma...*

*Grandma kept being annoying to me, so while she was sleeping I made her heart stop with my powers. From what I've heard, it happens to old people all the time. I guess I'll just have to see how everyone reacts in the morning. She wipes Polly's face with spit tissues too and she doesn't like it either. I think she'll be happy.*

*Susan and me have got to go to bed now! She's not alive at the moment.*

.......

*November 8, 1961*

*Well, Grandma's heart stopping didn't get the reaction I thought it would. When everyone woke up they started freaking out and crying for some reason. I asked why everyone was so sad, at least she wouldn't make our house smell like vinegar and wipe our faces with spit and make us eat gross things anymore. Daddy spanked me hard.*

*Daddy made arrangements for her funeral. It's next week, which means I'll have to sit through boring old church twice that week. And it'll be twice as boring now because of all the crying and what's more, I've heard the priest rambles on twice as much at funerals. And anyway, there's no way in the world I can ever see Grandma going to Heaven.*

*Or at least, it would be like that if I had to go! I'm running away tomorrow night, and I've planned where I'm running away to - the stars! They're so pretty, and even sometimes before this I've wondered what it would be like to live among them, maybe even talk to them and play with them. Plus I'd be sort of living in the sky, and people tell me that's where God lives. Maybe they'll finally pray to me!*

*I've asked Violet one last time if she wants to go, and she still said no. I'm really going to miss her. I told her that, and she hugged me.*

*I'm not packing anything. My powers will provide everything for me.*

*At school today, I didn't pay attention in anything and Mrs Millie lectured me, but I don't have to pay attention to anything because soon I'll never have to go to school again! I still haven't quite figured out how living with stars will work, but I'm sure my powers will make things work. They always do.*

*Also today I erased mean ol' Macy Markman. She's a bully, and no one would have missed her anyway had I just sent her to the cornfield without doing anything else about her, but I wanted to make extra sure no one would panic about her. Anyway, there's now a spare desk in Mrs Millie's classroom.*

*As usual, I have to go to bed now, and tomorrow's entry will probably be my last one.*

*Bye now!*

So that's the third last and second last entries. And as you would probably expect from a diary like this one, I can assure you that the last entry is without a doubt the strangest. I remember rereading it a few times myself in disbelief. There was no way that could have *really* happened...

**right?**

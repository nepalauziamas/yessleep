My mom told me that if I wanted to get a new phone for Christmas, I would have to save up my own money, that’s what got me the babysitting gig in the first place. 

A lot of neighborhoods around here are pretty well off and a simple ad on Facebook was all it took for about six families lining me up for work on the first week. 

At first everything was going just fine, none of the kids were bad. I think given they all came from privileged households the worst issue I had was some occasional snark. 

But that all changed when I got a DM from the Pynchon family matriarch. 

“Hello there. Sorry to message you out of the blue. One of my bridge club members mentioned you are the best babysitter in the business and my husband and I were thinking of trying to get a nice relaxing evening alone sometime next week. Would you be available?”

I knew the name well. I recalled they had been in the news a few years back, but couldn’t remember the exact details. This family practically handled half of the city finances. They were rich, powerful and would probably pay through the nose. So of course I said yes. We discussed fees and such for the rest of the night and arranged for the day to be the Thursday after that. 

When I got to the house I wasn’t at all surprised to find that Missus Pynchon and her husband were already gone for their movie night out. They trusted me enough with their children that no introductions were needed. 

My main concern that night was a bad storm. I even texted them to see if they wanted to reschedule but they were adamant that they simply had to get away. “Been cooped up here too long because of covid,” the husband responded in the group chat. 

I couldn’t argue with that. Restrictions were finally lightening up and that was the main reason I needed this money. 

My worry came true though when I arrived at their luxurious house and found their power was out. 

A boy and girl, both age seven met me in the main entry. Fraternal twins. 

“Hey there! I’m June,” I told them both. The kids didn’t even bother to register a response. 

“I’m Abby,” the girl said reluctantly.  

“I guess we will have to play board games by candle light or something huh?” I said looking around the dark house. 
I was surprised at the lack of furnishings. It didn’t seem like any of the photos even included the boy in them, another odd thing. 

But I shrugged it off and led the kids to the living room, asking them what they wanted to do. 

“I’m sure you must have something fun around here?” I asked. 

The two both fidgeted. They had something on their mind but seemed too scared to say. 

“Come on, don’t worry about anything being off limits. I won’t tell your parents, scouts honor,” I teased. 
Honestly I just wanted to make time fly by. Being stuck in this massive house with two stoic children wasn’t my idea of a perfect evening. 

“There’s an old ouija board upstairs. In the attic. Can we use it?” the girl asked. 

I scratched my head, surprised that they had jumped to that idea first off. But whatever. If it kept them happy and distracted I didn’t see the harm. 

“In the attic? How do I get up there?” I asked. 

They showed me the way eagerly to the top of the staircase. A rope dangled in the shadows to tug and I paused briefly to look down the hall toward their rooms. One room was boarded up. 

“What’s that over there?” I asked. 

“Come on, let’s play something scary!” the boy complained. 

I shrugged and pulled the cord, the old attic ladder creaking and giving way to fall. I used my smartphone to peer into the attic and told them both to stay there. 

For some reason I got a cold chill over my body as I climbed to the attic and looked around. 

Most of the place was deserted. Just old dusty boxes, furniture and knickknacks. It occurred to me that I should have probably texted the parents before coming up here just to be sure this was okay, but the storm had knocked out signal. I had to make due with the weird game even if I wasn’t sure their folks approved. 

I found the old board game about ten minutes later, all the while below I heard the twins whine impatiently. I sincerely hoped it was the right thing as I climbed back down and dusted it off. The copy they had looked very old. Possibly never even opened. 

“Let’s go to the living room,” the girl said, eagerly grabbing the box. 

We all sat around the center coffee table as they got the weird game set up. 

“So you want a good scare huh?” I said rubbing my hands together. 

“I want to contact the dead,” Abby said. Her voice sounded so serious. 

“Who are you gonna call!” I teased. They didn’t laugh. Both seemed to be waiting for me to make a move with the board. 

“Aren’t we supposed to ask it questions?” the girl asked. 

I took out the instructions to get an idea, not wanting to admit I had actually never messed with one of these before. I’m supposed to be the cool babysitter. 

“ ‘Place board on a leveled surface untouched by any participants along with planchette. All parties should agree to questions beforehand and then ask one at a time after all touching the planchette together. Wait one to five minutes for a response. If there is no response, ask a different question.’ “ 

I  shuffled toward the board and got the kids to settle on which side to sit on, commenting, “Did you have any questions you wanted to ask?”

Abby cleared her throat. “Has anyone ever died in this house?” 

“Ooh creepy,” I said. I sat back and waited. 

Honestly I didn’t expect anything to happen. I was more worried the kids would lose interest and get bored. 

Then after two minutes, to my surprise the planchette moves. 

Y-E-S. 

“Whoa! Did you see that??” the boy asked excitedly. 

“Okay. Now we are getting somewhere!” The girl replied. 

I scratched my head, a little unnerved by the exchange as I thought about the logistics. This was how these things are supposed to work, right? Just harmless fun? 


“Who died. We should ask that!” the boy said. 

“Who died?” Abby asked. 

M-E. 

“Very clever,” the girl said, rolling her eyes. She didn’t bother to wait to ask the next question. 

“And who are you?” I asked. 

J-A-C-K. 

The boy stopped laughing, actually looking a bit scared. 

“Wait. That’s my name. How does this thing know my name?” 

“Have you ever played with this before?” I asked, wondering if the kids were just trying to play a prank on me. 

“No. Never,” Abby said. She looked like she was about to cry. 

“All right. Who killed you?” I asked. 

Nobody moved as the storm outside battered the house harder. Perfect setting for such a creepy situation. 

J-U-N-E R-I-G-E-L. 

Now I was the one who looked confused. 

“Me? What the hell is this thing talking about?” 

“You’re going to kill me?” Jack asked nervously. 

“Hold on, calm down,” I said, getting up and standing in front of Abby. It was clear they were taking this a little too seriously. 

“Let’s just put the game up and then play something else okay?” I suggested. I didn’t even want to admit that maybe I was also scared by this thing. How could they know my full name? Had their parents told them?

“Stay away from me!” the little girl said angrily as she tried to push me. 

“Enough. It’s just some weird prank, I’m not going to hurt anyone,” I insisted as I started to pack up the game. 

“What if it’s telling us the future?” the boy whispered, his voice shaking. 

“I said that’s enough. Let’s just play something else. I’m sure there are other games in that dusty attic.” Both children remained stoic and silent as I tugged at the cord and the ladder fell. Abby looked as pale as a ghost. 

“I’ll be right back,” I told them both. 

As I got up to the attic and tucked the antique game away I shook off that disturbing feeling as best as I could. 
It’s just a prank. A game. I’m sure their parents told my name before they left for the evening I thought. 

As I started looking through boxes though, that same uneasiness manifested again. I saw family portraits that showed the entire group all looking happier and noticed these pictures included Jack. Why had his parents pushed him out of sight?

Then I heard a sharp click behind me and turned to see that the ladder had been locked back in place. 

“Damn it. Jack! Open this door right now!” I shouted as I tried to wiggle the lock on my side. 

“No! You’re gonna hurt me!” He shouted back. 

“I promise I won’t. But if you don’t let me out of here I might get hurt! There are spiders and bugs up here,” I hoped maybe I could appeal to his empathy. 

“I don’t believe you,” Jack shouted back. 

I kicked at the ladder, trying to get it loose. 

“Jack, you’ll be in so much trouble when your parents get home!”

He didn’t respond this time and I panicked, kicking the latch as hard as I could. 

The ladder slammed down, and I heard a sharp sound below followed by a cry of alarm. I looked down to see that the ladder had hit Jack directly in the face and he was trying his best to stop the bleeding as his sister screamed. 

“Oh my god, oh my god. I’m coming right down,” I said frantically. 

Jack stumbled backward a few steps. “Get away from me! You’re gonna hurt me!” 

I saw what happened next in slow motion. His feet wobbled in the air for a second. And then he tumbled down the stairs, slamming his body against the first floor as his sister screamed even louder. 

“Shit. Shit shit shit!!!” I shouted as I ran down and tried to see if he was still breathing. Jack was motionless. 

I fumbled with my phone trying to see if I could get a signal. Nothing. 

“Stay here! I’m going to the neighbors to see if I can make a call to 911!!” I told the little girl as I bolted out of the house in the rain. 

Thunder rumbled overhead as i passed my parked car, and a brief nagging thought told me to just get in and drive away. I could pretend I was never here. The parents would never know. They couldn’t prove the accident was my fault. 

I can’t tell you how appalled I was that this lingered in my mind as I ran toward the nearest house. Then as I reached the end of the driveway I saw headlights in the rain. 

The Pynchons were back. 

“Shit!!” I shouted as I ran back to the big house. 

I waved my arms frantically to the couple as they got out under their covered garage. Both of them looked like they had a good evening but seemed surprised by my presence. 

“Before you go inside I need to explain something please,” I said. 

“You’re the babysitter… what are you doing out here?” the mom asked in an irate voice. Dad was already unlocking the door. 

Abby was standing there crying. 

“She left me mommy.  She left me here all alone!!” she screamed. 

“No! I was trying to go get help!” I explained. 

“Was there an accident?” her father asked as we all stepped inside. 

“Jack fell down the stairs. I tried to help him, but it was too late,” I said, my voice hardly even audible. 

“What?” mom whispered. 

Abby kept crying and I sobbed and answered, “It’s my fault. I’m so sorry!” 

“How do you know what happened to our Jack?” the man asked, his voice as cold as ice. 

What? What did he mean by that? 

“I was… I was here. It just happened.” 

We all walked toward the steps. I didn’t see Jack’s body anywhere. 

“She’s been talking to herself all night mommy. I think she’s a witch!!” Abby said, sobbing uncontrollably. 

“Abby go upstairs,” the mother said as I looked around, trying to comprehend what was happening. 

“No. When I got here there were two children. Jack and Abby. Abby wanted to play with a ouija board up in the attic….” 

I noticed the father’s expression grow more and more concerned. 

“Our son died two years ago. Exactly as you described. We’ve had his room boarded up ever since.” 

“What?” I couldn’t hardly recognize my voice. 

“We never knew how it happened. We hired a sitter and she brought over a copy of her ouija board to play with. We thought it was harmless. Then the sitter disappeared and Jack had an accident. Abby claimed a demonic force was here that night when the sitter disappeared. Something in the attic… we locked away that cursed toy that night, shut off all memories of Jack in the attic,” he whispered. 

“I wish I knew if you were the same girl but that would be impossible… wouldn’t it?”

I started to nervously laugh. “This is a prank right. Y’all are pulling my leg?” I asked. 

He held his wife, both of them visibly shaken and scared now. 

“I’m calling the police,” the father said, holding his family close. 

I’m waiting now to try and explain myself to the authorities, if I can. I know what I experienced tonight was real, but I have no proof. Even the original texts sent for my sitting job are gone. Deleted from existence. 

Maybe I did go back to that night two years ago. Maybe I was here? I’m not sure of anything anymore. 

But as I wait, I’ve seen Jack romp through the house; smiling and playing. I think he has found a way to live on through their guilt over what happened two years ago. 

It could have been an accident. Or something far more sinister from a harmless game. 

But either way, it destroyed my life.

They watch us, at least when we're asleep.

I started trying to lucid dream when I was young. At the age of 13 I read about it online, and I was instantly fascinated.

I bought a cheap quartz crystal from a novelties shop in town. I would put it under my pillow and lay supine to try and spark a lucid dream. I learned how to do checks to become concious in a dream state. Flick a light switch, look at a clock then look away and look back, open a book. All things which could indicate you were dreaming.

At first, I had no luck. So I researched more. I read that keeping a dream journal helps. So I began to write down every dream as soon as I woke up and in as much detail as I could recall. Even little details like the shape and placement of a tree.

Soon my dreams were incredibly vivid and I was aware I was dreaming. I would soar around unfamiliar lands, see people naked, fight and win monsters. All the typical things a 13 year old would wish to dream about. And the next morning I would write it all down...

But then I stopped. Nightmares, began to feel too real when they did come, and I wanted it to end. 13 nights of pure bliss were not worth the one night waking up dripping sweat and shaken to the core.

Until about a year ago... my father made a friend who was really into meditation and binural beats, and my father sent me a youtube video of Dr. Brian Weiss doing a past life regression.

The video was incredible. I fell asleep the first 4 attempts, but finally I made it through, and it was eye opening.

I began again. Using binural beats to help meditate before sleep. Clearing my mind and taking a few moments to meditate before drifting asleep. It was refreshing. I was sleeping great and having wonderful dreams.

I did more research, learned about the concept of 4th, 5th, 6th, etc dimensional beings. The idea that sleep, much like drugs such as acid, peyote, ayehuasca, etc could connect us with such beings. Maybe I don't believe that in entirety but I do believe it connects us to another realm, where things with sapience besides humans dwell.

But tonight, I learned the truth. After a long day and too much caffeine, I laid down to go to sleep. I found a comfortable position, closed my eyes, cleared my head, and focused on my breathing. Before I truly fell unconcious, I saw eyes. At first it was just a single pair, but then more appeared. Clear as day, white sklera with dark pupils. They didn't blink. They had no face. Then a glow to what I can only describe as the upper left of my field of "view." My body felt a sensation it hadn't felt before and I was floating through what seemed like a tunnel. This was all in first person and my eyes were closed.

My next moment of conciousness I was in a place I did not recognize. I was with a friend/colleague of mine and I was following him. It was strange because he was wearing a naval work uniform, and we are both army. I chased after him and he seemed to vanish. I turned around looking back to get where I was and I felt a force pulling me away from where I was trying to go. I then knew I was dreaming. I leaned away from the force to allow my feet to leave the ground and float. Perfectly balanced, but unable to move.

It was at this moment I thought I awoke. Most people describe sleep paralysis demons as tall shadowy creatures looming over you, but not these. They seemed to be watching, as few as 3 but no more than 6. They stood around and watched, as one I couldn't see lifted my arms, moved my legs, rolled me on my side. I flipped off one of the things watching and managed to mumble "fuck off."

I woke up. Same bed I had been meditating in. Same position I had been sleeping in. But now, the chills run down every part of my body. My feelers are up, because I know even while awake, they're still watching.

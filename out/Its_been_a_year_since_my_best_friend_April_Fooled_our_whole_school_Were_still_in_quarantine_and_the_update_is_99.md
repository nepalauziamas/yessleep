None of that matters. Not here, where time doesn’t exist, only in bursts of singularity.

I measure it in my own breaths, every time the lights above me blink out.

Pretty, pretty lights.

Dancing in my head.

99%.

We’re a ticking time bomb which has stopped ticking.

So close to a climax. 

This part will be in two pieces. 

1 today.

1 tomorrow.

: )

So, I told you who started this.

Why don’t I tell you why he started this?



…

…

…


“Oh, wow. “

Jasper’s voice was in my head, a static sing-song. “Mara doesn't know.”

He continued, his words twisting into a nursery rhyme. 

“Mara doesn’t know, Mara doesn’t know.” 

I felt him inside me—his fingers skimming over raw bone, eliciting a screech on my lips that never surfaced. I sensed him. No, I sensed us. 

Hysterical laughter poured from his mouth like poison and bubbled in my throat. I was wide awake, my eyes open, blinking up at an unfamiliar ceiling covered in vines and mould. 

I was laughing with him, giggling, murmuring unintelligible words to myself because I wouldn’t think about the reality of what was happening

That he had torn into me piece by piece, and was delving inside the most precious parts of me, what had been suppressed deep, deep down.

“What does Mara not know?” 


“How we came to be, of course!”

I could hear it, that sound--- the live wire in my head sizzling, buzzing, binding me to the others. How I moved from one classroom to the other was a blur. One minute I had been tied to a chair in Jasper’s classroom, and the next I was back in the IT room. Reality was crumbling and I was letting it. 

I was letting oblivion take me.

This time I was lying on a desk turned surgical bed, my arms and legs bound by squirming tendrils. Jasper was hanging over me, his eyes shut, lips parted slightly, like seeing me like this filled him with unbridled pleasure. His sing-song voice was  still echoing in my head, questions that were still struggling to register. The best part of falling, I thought—thinking back to seeing little Rory slam the Sleeping Beauty book down on the teddy bear, her bright eyes filled with something hollow.

Something dark.

The best part of falling…

As if latching onto my thoughts, Jasper parroted my words in a soft sigh.

“Yes, Mara. The best part of falling.”

His warm breath flittered, grazing my cheeks.

But I couldn’t move. I could only think about him, feel him, his fingernails dancing across the raw bone of my skull, ready to divulge. I wasn’t when it was exactly that I’d lost myself. Maybe it was seeing memories I didn’t remember. To his words, I only laughed. I laughed until I saw red, until my hands clenched into fists and I was overcome with the urge to—hurt. To mutilate my own body, to make someone else hurt. “See, with you, it’s going to take a lot more to shatter you. Not what I’m doing to you—getting my hands dirty, entangling my fingers inside unconverted brain tissue. It’s what I’m going to show you. Because, just like I said, the best part of plunging into hopelessness, what is it?”

I knew his answer. 

He’s said it so many times, laughing through it, giggling through a manic grin.

“Remembering, Mara.” He murmured. “Remembering, remembering, remembering…”

“Remembering...” I whispered, my body jolting when he pressed pressure on my skull. My body was filled with electroshocks, a knife slicing through me, ripping me apart from the inside. This torture he was putting me through, wasn’t torture at all. It was something else entirely. Something I’ve described to you in so many words, words on the edge of my tongue that I can’t get out—phrases and sentences that die in my throat because my lips are numb and so tired—so fucking tired. Tired of putting that sensation into words, bring it to life.

Imagine the best you’ve ever felt and times it by infinity, if infinity even exists. It exists here. Blackwood—where infinity and oblivion come together and create this—a state of mind where my thoughts repeated and entangled together, and I writhed in its singularity. Ecstasy was what I felt.

 Pleasure. I wanted him to continue, his fingers slick with my blood, delving further and further until there was none of me left. Jasper joined in when I let out a choked laugh which grew shrill and hysterical as my thoughts grew foggy and blurry—nonsensical. There was pain, I thought. It was agony, thrumming through me, making me want to die. Making me want to lurch up, reach into my own chest and pull out my heart.

But it wasn’t—pain, right? It wasn’t pain I was feeling. Oh, no. It was different. What I was feeling filled me with complete, unbridled happiness, and I was happy to choke on my last breaths--- as long as I could keep feeling it. Endless pain. Endless hopelessness and despair. I wanted it. I wanted to plunge further and further until I was swimming in it. Jasper leaned close—so close. And I thought about what he had shown me, what had truly sent me off the edge.

 Trying to piece the images together in my head was so hard—so tiring. All I could see was my younger self sitting in between a younger Connor, and a younger Joey. In a man’s office—a man who turned out to be the creator of the SUU virus, Jasper Mycroft’s father. Jasper himself seemed to follow my every word, every blurry thought that came to me. 

I knew he was enjoying it.


“Remembering…remembering what exactly led to all of this— all of those poisoned thoughts and memories picked away from us. I saw it all, Mara. All of it. Everything I swore I wouldn’t look for, because I knew. I knew it would do this to me. It would break me into tiny little pieces. “

“Tell me.” I managed to breathe. Instead of focusing on Jasper’s hands in my head, I stared at the ceiling tiles. I counted them. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Ten. Ten—

What did she show me? 


I couldn’t get the words out.

Rory. Rory. Rory.

Her name was on my lips, but so was a scream, a scream curling in the back of my throat, threatening to tear free. I needed to know. I needed to know what she had shown me. What did she show me?

Jasper didn’t reply, and I felt the sharp prick in the back of my skull. Following his own bare hands, vines began to snake through, piercing flesh and bone. I could taste blood on my lips, dribbling down my chin. “Humans prefer to hide their pain, to push it deep, deep down where it can’t hurt them and influence those bad, bad thoughts. Well, that’s no fun is it?”

“No.” I said, like I was in a trance. “No, not fun.”

The boy hummed with a nod. “Uh-huh. So, the million dollar question is: What makes a psychopath? Are we born bad, or— are we made? And in my father’s case, what were the main components in creating us?”

His voice imploded inside me, and I closed my eyes, letting darkness take over, enveloping my mind.

Taking me back.

There was a rainbow in the sky when I met Jasper Mycroft for the 1,997th time.

Those numbers aren’t accurate because it’s impossible to be fully right, though I wonder if the number was much higher than that. I wish I could settle on one. There were hundreds, thousands of times I’d met him—and each time was torn from me.

I can’t recall intimate details like the specific colours of the rainbow or how bright it was. I just know that there was one.  I remember the rainbow came after a storm, and it was the first thing my gaze found when I pushed through the swinging doors of Blackwood Children’s Surgery, my already muddy converse splashing into a puddle directly in front of me. I wasn’t a fan of the shoes, anyway, so I continued on, wading into filthy rainwater, laughing at the thought of mom being mad at me.  “Mara, you got your socks wet!” I could imagine her voice in my head—all high and shrill, and it only broadened my smile.

I twisted around to make sure nobody was watching, before opening my mouth and reaching to the very back where I had secretly stored the gross tasting Blank. Mr Mycroft lied when he said it would taste like blueberries and grapefruit. It tasted like barf. No, worse than barf. Like literal poop. After risking another glance, I spat the Blank onto my hand.

It had been a purple pill but had been dyed by my saliva, swimming in a pastel blue river. 

With my lip curling in disgust, I dropped the pill into the puddle. And just to make sure, I stamped my feet several times to make sure that it was gone, lost in brown murky puddle water. Gone. Letting out a breath of relief, I allowed myself to smile. 

I didn’t stop at that one puddle, dancing between each one filling up crevices in the parking lot. I was jumping up and down, enjoying the relief of the water drenching my tights and skirt, when a voice sounded out, automatically drawing my attention from soaking myself in rainwater. When I looked up, I caught a figure running across the parking lot. It was a kid in my class—a boy with blonde hair hiding under his hooded sweatshirt. I never really spoke to him, though I remembered getting into a heated conversation with him over which was better: Peanut butter or Nutella? He had yelled in my face so I smeared Nutella all over his ears.

Luke Aisling.

His name was on my lips.

He too was jumping in puddles, much to his mother’s disdain. Luke hopped from one to another, loudly announcing, “I’m the king of the puddles!”

I watched him, mulling the taste of the Blank around in my mouth.

He was like everyone else—everyone who had put the Blank into their mouth and swallowed.

Not like me, I thought. Unlike the others, I knew Blanks were bad.

Mr Mycroft wasn’t going to get me.

“Lucas!” Mrs Aisling, annoyed by him soaking the bottom of his jeans, grabbed his hand and pulled him out. “You’re embarrassing yourself!” she hissed out. “What did I say about being good?”

“But mom!” Luke cried, “I want to play in the puddles!”

He twisted around, sticking his tongue out at me.

I copied him, and he waved. “Can I say Hi to Mara at least?”

“No.” His mother said sternly. Though she did shoot me a friendly smile.

“Mara! How are you?”

I liked Luke’s mom. She always made good cookies. “Do you want a ride home?”

“But she’s all wet.” Luke frowned at my muddy converse.

Shaking my head, I grinned back. “No, I’m okay. My mommy is coming to get me.”

“Oh, right! Tell Evelyn I said Hi!” Luke’s mother wrestled with her son, who was trying to jump into another puddle, one of the deep ones even I wasn’t going to risk. I might have liked the look on mom’s face when she saw dirt splashed all over my skirt, but I liked my tights with the hearts on them. They were my favorite, and I’d made sure to shield them from the onslaught. This time he managed to get his toes in, letting out a cry of delight, before she yanked him back.  I found myself giggling at their exchange, smiling at the state of Luke. His hair looked funny. “Lucas! Do you want to see Grammy?”

“No! She smells funny!”

“Do you want me to tell her that?”

“No.”

Luke and his mother’s conversation faded into white noise, though I enjoyed listening to it.

I was watching him climb into the back of his mom’s fancy Honda Civic when my dress pocket vibrated. 

I pulled out the phone mom had given me for emergencies. It was her old phone because I wasn’t old enough for my own yet but didn’t like me going places on my own without some communication.

Which meant no downloading useless apps and games. I’d managed to hide Temple Run and Where’s My Water from her eagle eyes, however. I stepped out of the puddle, my gaze flicking to the notifications screen. Sure enough, there was a text from her sitting right at the top, below an Instagram notification from mom’s account she hadn't deleted. “Hey sweetie, how did it go? I’m waiting in the car.”

“Fine.” I texted back quickly. 

“Can I stay in the parking lot for a while?”

Her reply came automatically: “Why? Mara, it’s raining. You’re not wearing a jacket.”

When I tipped my head back and frowned at the sky, the rainbow was fading, the blistering sun sitting in a greyish blue sky. It reminded me of an egg yolk.

Something cold splashed onto my face, and I revelled in the feeling of it. There was something about the rain that I adored. I loved everything about it, muddy puddles and dancing in showers—even catching raindrops in my mouth. It was so much better than being inside under mom’s scrutinising gaze. It was almost like she was looking for things that were wrong with me.  “Just for a while.” I sent several pleading emojis. “Pleaseeeeeeee?”

Mom didn’t reply for a few minutes, and within those few minutes, I went back to splashing around in puddles. When my phone finally buzzed in my hand and I looked at the screen, I was met with “20 minutes, Mara. I’m just down the road.” Below that: “Do you want to talk about today’s session?”

“No.” I tapped back, stuffing my phone in my dress pocket. My eyes stung with frustrated tears, but I wiped them away. Mom wouldn’t understand.

She was on the adult’s side, anyway. I thought about the Blank I’d spat out. The one I knew Luke and the others had swallowed earlier. It was evil, I had quickly decided. The Blank did things I didn’t like.

It made the others act weird—it made me act weird and it didn’t taste like normal medicine. It tasted like something had gone off in my mouth.

I was leaping across puddles, intentionally landing in them and getting progressively wetter, enjoying the shower over my face and the front of my dress—when someone tapped me on the shoulder. It was so sudden I almost cried out. Though at the sound of an all too familiar laugh—one that I was grateful to remember, I turned to find myself face to face with a blur of dark curls hanging in wide eyes, a playful smile painted on his lips. The kid was frozen in what looked like an attempt to scare me again, his arms out, fingernails curled into makeshift claws. When I swallowed my cry and instead settled him with a glare, he laughed. “Well?” He rose on his tiptoes, regarding me with curious eyes.

“Well, what?” I shot back. Though I knew exactly what he was talking about.

Jasper moved closer. “What’s my name?”

“Oh, come on.” I couldn’t resist giggling. “I know who you are.”

“Say it, or I won’t believe you.”

I sighed. “You’re Jasper Mycroft—and yes, I do remember you.” I pointed behind him. “I did what you said and spat my Blank in a puddle.”

He held out his own fist and opened it, revealing a Blank sitting in a pool of spit.

I leaned back.  “Gross.”

Nodding, Jasper dropped his Blank onto the ground. “I don’t know how I held it in my mouth for so long.” He made a face, before focusing on me. “I just spent ten minutes trying to talk to Joey and Connor, and they looked at me like I was all googly-eyed—and then they ran off like I had Cooties.”

“Rory?” I sent him a hopeful look.

“Nope.” Jasper shook his head. “She’s the same. But she’s dad’s favorite.” His eyes darkened suddenly, and I felt something twist in my gut. I’d gotten good at pretending everything was okay, and I was just a kid splashing around in puddles. Jasper’s expression told me everything I needed to know. He wanted to know if I remembered everything—what I was supposed to forget. What we were all supposed to. 

I felt relieved, looking at him, at one of my closest friends since childhood. I still remembered him. Sure, there were blanks and holes in my brain where they shouldn’t have been, but Jasper still stood there, a shadow under the sun, his stupid smile and the overgrown curls hanging in wide eyes. I was so happy, then. I was so happy I knew him, that the stupid Blank hadn’t taken him away from me. Like it had taken Connor and Joey, and Rory—Luke, Ben and Levi. All of Mr Mycroft’s patients.

“Mara.” Jasper’s tone was soft. “Can you, uh—”

“Yes.” I cut him off before he could speak. “I remember.” I took a deep breath and closed my eyes.

Everything was still clear—still there in my head. 

“We sat in a circle and as usual it was really creepy.”

My breath hitched at the thought of what was still there, fresh, in my mind. “We sat in a circle and Mr Mycroft told Rory to stab that picture of her—of her mother,” I exhaled out a breath which hurt my tummy. 

I could still see her giggling, a smile stretched across her lips as she stabbed the knife in and out, plunging it into the photograph of her mother. I shook my head of the memory, tripping over my words. “Then he told Connor to rip up his favorite comic book, and… and he did.” I was crying, then. I didn’t realise it until something warm was dripping from my chin. I swiped at my eyes, still not opening them. 

“Mr Mycroft asked us if we wanted to prick our fingers on a needle, and we all said yes. Then he asked us how we felt.” No matter how hard I tried to push the memory down so I could retell it, but not relive it, it still came back in bursts that I couldn’t fight. The seven of us sitting together in a circle.

Joey and Connor frowning at their spiked fingers. Jasper, sitting across from me, mouthing something I couldn’t understand— and Rory, bouncing on her knees, holding her finger in the air, while Ben and Levi and Luke scowled at her. Out of all of us, Rory was the one who was enjoying Mr Mycroft’s tests. She was laughing, her eyes wide and bright, and scary.

“Can I do it again?” She whispered. “Just like Sleeping Beauty!”

Mr Mycroft, who was busy attaching strange, padded circles to her face, smiled widely.

“No, not right now, Aurora. That’s over for now. Though I am happy with your results.” I caught his frown, eyeing the rest of us. “I can’t say the same for the other children, however. It appears I’m going to have to do more tests.” He turned his eyes away from us, and I stuck out my tongue at him. 

“Witch.” I mouthed to Jasper. 

Connor, seeing my expression, did the same— Joey joined in, bugging out his eyes.

Jasper was the only one who wasn’t laughing. He sat silently, glaring at his father like he could burn a hole through Mr Mycroft’s head if he wanted to.  “Then…” I continued, thankful for Jasper entangling his fingers in mine. “We played Ring Around The Rosie like we always do, and Rory was hitting our heads too hard.”

“That’s right.” Jasper breathed. “And what did we say? When we pricked our fingers.”

I rolled my eyes, mocking his father’s nasally voice. “Now, kids, I want you to really visualise what you feel. Tell me what the pain does to you. Does it make you feel good or bad? I’m a weird freakazoid and I come from the planet Zog. Mara, I am going to eat your brain and it’s going to be very tasty! Mmm, tasty, tasty brains!”

Jasper poked me. “Hey! Doesn't that make me an alien too?”

I scrunched up my nose. “You're too nice to be from the planet Zog.”

I didn’t laugh with him. My index finger was still stinging thinking about the needle. Mr Mycroft gave us a choice whether we pricked our fingers, he always did. But when one of us refused, he always pulled a face which left a sicky feeling twisting in my tummy. But he never forced us. "We said it hurt," I whispered, my voice getting caught once more. "It did hurt. It always hurts, and I don’t understand why he wants us to say something different.”

“We all said it hurt, except Rory,” Jasper murmured.

I blinked open my eyes, wincing at the glare of the sun. The rays caught Jasper’s hair, hues of red and orange tingeing strands sticking from his hood. “Yeah.” I didn’t want to talk about her, though. Especially when Rory’s favorite thing to do was stamp on bugs and pull worms apart. 

“Then he told us as usual to take a Blank, and I held it in my mouth.”

“So did I,” Jasper said. “I don’t have weird melty brain today.”

I allowed myself to smile. “Because you didn’t take the Blank.”

“Right.” He nodded slowly. “That’s why the others looked at me like I was a total weirdo.”

“Because you are to them,” I said. “Your dad is playing with our memories, pretending to fix them, but he’s just making them worse. I’ve met you thousands of times, and until you snapped me out of it, I’m sure this right now would also be my first time speaking to you. Why is he doing this?” I scowled. “He’s supposed to make us feel better, but he’s turning our brains to Swiss cheese—and not the good kind.”

Jasper’s lip quirked. “You remember Rory.”

“She’s nuts! How could I forget her? She picks the legs off of spiders and makes roadkill into dolls!”

Jasper lost his smile. “Yeah, she's weird. So. How do you feel?”

“Like poop. Won’t your dad get really mad when he sees we’re not taking our Blanks?”

“I don’t care,” Jasper curled his lip. “He’s doing something to us. I'm not stupid. He says we have bad memories, a weird sickness I haven’t even heard of—- and I think he’s using it as an excuse to use us for something, and it's bad.”

“Use us?” I whispered.

“Yeah.” He leaned forward, getting in my face. His breath smelled of the Blank. “Do you know what Gaslight means?”

I nodded. “Yeah. It’s like an oil lamp, right?”

It only took one look at his face for me to know I was wrong.

“What? What is it?” I gasped. “Wait, is it like—a bad word?”

The boy rolled his eyes. “No, silly. Gaslight. It means…” He cocked his head. “Do you know that SpongeBob episode when SpongeBob and Sandy have a baby starfish, and Patrick got scared because he thought it was his baby and got really mad? Squidward also broke his flute and lost his voice, and got like, really mad.”

“I don’t think I’ve seen that episode.”

“No, you did. It was on Nickelodeon a while ago. Everyone was talking about it at school.”

“Jasper, I have Swiss cheese memories, why would I remember an episode of SpongeBob?”

“I’m telling you!” Jasper grabbed my shoulders and shook me, his eyes wild. “You’ve seen it, Mara.”  

I frowned, about to yell at him, though when I saw his smile, I groaned. “What?”

“That.” Jasper cleared his throat, stepping back. “Is gaslighting. I learned about it on Google. Plus, mom uses the word on dad a lot, so I looked it up on the computer. I tried to tell you to believe something that doesn’t exist. That isn’t real.” His expression darkened and I had a sudden urge to grab his hand and not let go. "That’s what my dad is doing to you. He’s trying to make you believe stuff that isn’t real. That you have something wrong with your brain—that we all have something wrong with our brains, so he can make it worse. And when he does his tests, he tells us things that don’t make sense—just like that pricking our fingers should feel good when it doesn’t. And it’s working, Mara. Rory is scaring me.”

I glared at the ground. “She’s scaring me too.”

“Why am I scaring you?”

I twisted around, only to be faced with Rory, who was holding Mr Mycroft’s hand.

As usual, she stared right through me.

Jasper paled, his eyes widening. “Dad. I was… umm.. I was talking to this girl.”

“Go inside, please.” The man said calmly. He wasn’t buying Jasper’s attempt to pretend he had no idea who I was. He was too smart. “You’re sick, Jasper. Do you know how many times you’ve collapsed today? And you come outside in this heat? Young man, do you understand the seriousness of your illness?”

“Yes, dad. But if you just listen to me—"

“Mr Mycroft.” I managed to get out, drowning out Jasper’s words.  “It’s not his fault. It was my idea.”

His eyes swivelled to me, piercing and cruel.

“Playing with the mind of a sick boy, Mara? That is nothing to be proud of.” He grabbed Jasper’s hand and pulled the boy to his side. “I can look past this as long as you follow me inside, and you can take your medicine right in front of me where I can see you ingest it fully and prove to me you've taken it."

“I’m okay,” I whispered, taking slow steps back. 

“I’m actually really okay now. I don’t need to come here anymore. I have a fixed brain.”

Mr Mycroft cocked a brow. “Mara, do you want to be better? I’m sure your mother wants what is best for you, and what is best is right here.” His lip curled. “Unless you want to suffer from memory problems for the rest of your life.”

Before I could answer, he grabbed my arm, and his fingernails dug into my skin. I had to bite back a cry. “Come on, Miss Delaney. You are ten years old now. You’re not a child anymore.”

“Hey!” I tried to wrench away, but he tightened his grip. “That—that hurts!”

“Does it?” He turned his beady eyes on me. His eyes drunk me in. Hungry.

“Mara, it’s just a pinch.”

“Dad, you’re hurting her!” Jasper yelled.

“Nonsense! I’m barely touching her!”

Maybe I was imagining it, but he kept going, plunging his nails into my arm until I let out a shriek.

When we reached the doors to the doctor’s surgery, however, my mom appeared looking flustered, a frown on her face. She was staring at Mr Mycroft’s hand wrapped around my arm. Her mouth was open, and I knew she was going to start yelling. But then she must have remembered that my sessions were free of charge. Before I could cry out, the man let go of my arm and my mother swiftly stepped in and grabbed my hand.  No words were exchanged between my mother and Jasper’s dad.

“Jasper, come on.” Mr Mycroft barked at the boy, who started towards me.

“Do you remember what I said?” He hissed out. “Keep doing it, okay?” He mimed spitting out the Blank. I nodded. I wanted to say something back, maybe goodbye, but his dad pulled him away. Jasper managed a wave. “I’ll see you in school!” 

Mom led me back to the car and I stayed silent, stewing in fury. I’d watched Jasper be dragged away by his father, and I knew what came next. 

I’d seen it in Rory when I tried to tell her about the sessions and she just smiled at me with a funny look on her face and asked for the gazillionth time if we could watch Sleeping Beauty. It was almost like the other kids were under a spell, and Mr Mycroft was the evil witch. He could definitely make us sleep, so Rory’s obsession with always playing Prick The Princess hit a little too close to home.  

A little while later I was sitting in the back of my mom’s car, trying to find words in my mouth that explained that I was scared, that I needed her more than I ever had before—when I glimpsed a nurse push through the doors. In her arms, crumpled in a heap, a blur of dark curls and dangling arms.

I couldn’t help it. Throwing open the car door, I ran across the parking lot, splashing through puddles, until I came face to face with the unsmiling nurse with Mr Mycroft’s unconscious son hanging from her arms.  I hated the nurse that didn’t smile. She reminded me of a witch with her squinty eyes and pointy nose. I leaned forward, peeking. 

No. he wasn’t unconscious. Jasper was awake, but his eyes were half-lidded, his lips set in a line.

I raised my hand in a wave, trying to get his attention, but his gaze was somewhere else, on the sky—or maybe the rapidly fading rainbow I had forgotten about. He smiled, but his smile wasn’t quite on me. I don’t know where he was looking or what he was seeing, but I recognised that hollow look in his eyes. I’d seen it in Rory’s—Connor and Joey and Luke’s. 

They had all looked right through me.

“Jasper?” I whispered.

The boy blinked at me, his eyes wide and curious and not quite all there.

“Mara, darling. Jasper isn’t feeling great, so I’ve been instructed to take him home.” The unsmiling nurse took a step forward, but I jumped in front of her with my arms stretched out, blocking her.

“What did you do to him?” I demanded.

The nurse looked at me like all the adults did. Like I was sick. Like I was talking in an alien language.

“Oh, he’s fine!” The nurse cooed. “He’s just tired.”

“No, he’s not!” I yelled, stamping my feet. I was crying, then, and I hated it. Because the nurse pulled that face. The face they all made. Like I was sick. Swiping at my eyes, I struggled to speak through my sobs. I wouldn’t let her take him away from me. They had all been torn away from me, friends I’d made over and over and over again, friends I forgot the names of minutes after meeting them. Jasper was an exception. The only one who I knew for sure. 

“I know you did something to him and I want you to tell me what you did,” I inhaled a breath. It was so hard to breathe—my tummy was hurting and I felt like I was going to barf. I swallowed a shriek. It wasn’t fair! It wasn’t fair that they were trying to make me forget him, make me forget about the tests and Rory acting weird. They were plunging my memories into a deep, dark hole and it wasn’t fair. “Give me Jasper. I want to talk to him right now.”

“Miss Delaney, don’t be rude. You don't say you want, you say please” Her eyes narrowed. “As I told you I am taking Jasper home.”

“Well, let me speak to him!” I paused. “Please!”

“Mara, what are you doing?”

Mom was standing with her usual wide and worried eyes. “Why did you run away like that?”

I couldn’t get the words out, only pointing at Jasper.

Following my gaze, mom let out a sharp exhale of breath. “Oh.  As you can see, Jasper is too tired to play.” She sent the nurse an apologetic smile. “I apologise,” she chuckled. “Kids, right?”

The nurse didn’t smile back. “It’s no problem. We’re used to these types of children.”  

Her squinty eyes found mine. “He’s fine. He’s just going home to rest.”

I hated the way she looked at me. “You did something to him! You took him away, you took all of them away and you’re doing this! You’re doing this!” I was screaming. I expected mom to grab my hand, but she didn’t. She stood and watched. When the nurse was gone, and I couldn’t chase after them,  mom’s hands took my cheeks and forced me to look at her. She swiped my tears away, cradling my face.

“What did I say about taking deep breaths?” She murmured, “Come on, Mara. You’re a big girl now.”

I did what she said, sucking in a deep breath and exhaling.

But it hurt. Everything hurt when I breathed in and then out, forcing air into my lungs.

Mom nodded. “There. See. You’re okay, Mara. Jasper is just going home to rest, okay?”

“No,” I mumbled. “No, they made him—they made him forget me.”

Sighing, mom played with my hair, brushing strands from my eyes. “That’s what your condition is, honey. You forget things. That’s why you come here. Mr Mycroft is trying to help you feel better. Just give him a chance, Mara.”

I shook my head. “He pricked me.”

“Mara, that’s a shot. Stop being silly.”

“No, on my finger! Like Sleeping Beauty, mom!”

Mom’s expression was impatient. “Let’s go home. I have ice cream melting in the car.”

Giving in, I took one last look at the Children’s Surgery, and then the car Jasper had been taken to. 

I couldn’t see him anymore, but I had an idea of what school would look like the next day. He was going to look right through me like the others and I was going to be alone. My tummy hurt. I reached for mom’s hand, her comforting grip, entangling my fingers in hers when something—something spiked me. The pain came in sharp rivulets and I tugged away with a cry, my gaze going to the palm of my hand where a startling red spot pooled in the centre. I poked it and it seemed to collapse into a tiny river staining the veins in my palm. It was beautiful and terrifying and yet I couldn’t stop poking it, sliding it across my palm, spreading the red all over my fingers. 

Blood.

I stared at my hand, mesmerised by the red—by the tiny spots of blood.

I jumped when mom grabbed my hand, suddenly, her eyes wide. “Oh, Mara, I’m so sorry! I got them for your room, but I completely forgot I was holding them!” She was holding a bunch of roses, and I could see sharp thorns sticking out. Something deep inside me, something brewing, twisting in my gut and heavy in my chest, was fascinated by the thorn. I had to stop myself from pricking my finger on it.

“Mara, are you okay?”

When I looked up and saw my mom’s expression, something slimy crept up my throat.

“Mommy?” I whispered.

“Hm?” When she turned to me, the wind seemed to ripple in her hair, blowing it from her eyes.

She wasn’t smiling. Instead, there was something curled on her lip, something I couldn’t understand. Mom wanted me to get better, I knew that. I also knew there was no way I’d be able to convince her Mr Mycroft was the one making me sick. When mom looked at me, it was with that same pitiful frown—the sad eyes. It almost made me believe I really was sick. In the corner of my eye, there was a shadow bleeding under the sun. I saw it perfectly, but the shadow had no face. I only saw red hair framing a heart-shaped face, a light pink t-shirt and skirt, white converse and a red ribbon dancing in the air. Instead of an identity, a giant red X blocked out her face.

Almost like I’d plucked a crayon out of thin air and scribbled her out completely.  I didn’t look at the shadow person, I looked at my mother.

And I tried not to cry.

There was a voice—the shadow person was speaking.

It was a girl, her voice soft, like a whisper in the wind. “Mrs Delaney, can I talk to Mara please?”

Mom didn’t react to her voice, her eyes on me. “Honey, what’s wrong?”

When I blinked, the girl was gone.

“It’s nothing.”

Mom hummed. “Well, okay then. Hurry up. I got your favourite ice cream.”

I followed her, splashing through puddles.

This time I didn’t smile when rainwater filled my shoes.

I wanted to go back to Jasper, to see if he was okay. But part of me knew he was already gone.

The memory faded as quickly as it had come. My world collapsed into nothing. My mother’s expression,  spotted raindrops on my face and the grey sky above—everything but the shadow at the back of my mind, the redhead with no face. They felt so close and yet so far away, so hard to see and touch, run my fingers over their face. “Still there, Mara?” Jasper’s voice was back, a low murmur in my skull. I could feel him once again, his fingers digging deep. I was back in the IT room, staring up at twisted vines above me. “See, weren’t we cute?” He chuckled. “Thanks for saving me, by the way.”

His younger self’s frightened eyes filled my thoughts.

“I tried,” I gasped. “I tried, I tried, I tried.”

I forced the words through my lips, the images of my ten-year-old self slamming into me like icy waves of water. Not just images—I was overcome with her emotions, pain and anger and frustration.  It was enough to ground me, at least for the moment. “I—I tried to stop him,” I choked out, and then I said it again and again and again until it stuck. How did I forget? I wanted to scream. How did I forget him?

How could Jasper be one of the most important people in my life as a kid and a stranger years later? 

Jasper hung over me, cocking his head. More vines had entangled themselves around his head, taking over completely. His eyes were starting to resemble Rory’s, empty sockets glistening with that familiar spark. “Did you, though? Because it looks to me that you let him continue hacking away at us. Like his little rats.”

“No.” I shook my head, but his hands cradled my face.

“Yes,” Jasper said in a breathy laugh. “You didn’t say anything, did you? Which meant he kept going and going and going until Rory’s head was all messed up, and I was on another fucking planet, Mara. You see, this is the best part of getting your memories back. Everything that happened to me, all the messed up shit my dad did to all of us? It only made me feel better! Greater, even! Fuck, it’s given me a hell of a boost and now? Now, I only feel free. And I want you to feel like that too, you know? I want you to feel like you’re being ripped apart from the inside. Like no help is coming, and you’re alone with memories that are better, crumbling, logical thought melting away—nothing else remaining but the overwhelming urge to hurt.”

“Jasper.” I swallowed a cry.

Reality was so much harder to endure.

If I really thought about it, I preferred when my thoughts were twisted—when I craved oblivion.

Because then I would have joined in with his laughter, and not cared about what he was doing.

“Let me go,” I whispered, my body shuddering at the force of the tendrils squirming inside my head.

I could feel them digging, just like his hands, searching for more. “I can help you. The outside can help us. I’m in contact with a man.”

He sputtered. “The organisation that did this to us? Oh, yeah. I can’t wait to show you what they did. Now that? That’s another party. See, it’s more they took away. And I’m just giving it back to you. Like the great friend I am.”

Jasper’s movements were slow, torturously slow. I felt his fingernails scraping against my skull.

I jumped when Jasper let out a sharp twisted cry, mocking his own voice. “No, Dad, please! I don’t want to see this! I don’t want to see this. I don’t want to see this. Please, don’t make me watch this! Stop! Please, stop! Don’t make me!”

For a disorienting moment I thought that he was back. That Jasper has regained his mind. 

But then he burst into giggles.

It almost sounded like Jasper was recalling a younger version of himself—and yet his expression stayed twisted, a psychotic grin spread across his lips, hollow eyes drinking me in. 

“See? Oh, I haven’t even shown you the juicy bits yet. For example, did you know Alexa Blake wasn’t your first kill? Oh, no. Before the video, before you were driven to madness, it wasn’t the first time, was it? No wonder Joey took a liking to you on the roof, Mara. This isn’t your first rodeo, is it? Even before the virus took you, you were quite the character.” 

Jasper’s voice rattled in my head, filling me with poison. “You’ve done this before.”

So, there's half of what I lost. 

Half of what brought me here.

I’ll be back tomorrow to show you the other half.

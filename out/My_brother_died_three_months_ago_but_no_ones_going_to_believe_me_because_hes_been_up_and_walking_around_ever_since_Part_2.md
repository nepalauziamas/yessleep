I was really hoping I wouldn’t have to update this today. Max is definitely dead. I’m currently sitting in my car at a JavaStop stealing wifi and avoiding my sister’s calls. I texted her this morning and told her that something came up at work, and suggested I pay for a taxi service to bring Max—or whatever that *thing* is—home. Jamie used periods in her brief responses to me, so I know I’m in trouble when I decide to show up tonight. *If* I decide to show up tonight. I think her girlfriend volunteered to make the trip instead—they’ve only been together six months so it’s probably going to be awkward. But awkward beats horrifying and that’s what it would’ve looked like had I gone.

There are two things I now know for sure: There is something very wrong with this new Max.

And he very much so wants to make that my problem.

Any advice would be welcomed at this point. But I guess I’ll explain what happened first.

\*\*\*

If asked to recall the moment she knew I was weird, my mother would launch into a story about a freak accident at a church picnic she took us to when we were kids. Max was six, so was I—for two more weeks, and then I was back to being older. Julie was probably nine or ten— I can’t remember if she’d had her birthday yet. At the end of each school year, the tiny Methodist church in our neighbourhood capitalized on parents who hadn’t yet lost that beginning-of-summer enthusiasm for family outings, and invited everyone in town—virtuous and sinner alike—to a barbecue, complete with a couple of rented fair rides and a cotton candy stand on the shore of the only lake in our region in hopes that they could entice a few more families to add to the tithing pool on Sundays.

We weren’t a religious family. After the incident at the lake, Mum tried taking me to church for a while but that didn’t last. She’d tell you at this point in the story that she probably should’ve taken me to see a therapist— not because she didn’t believe me, but because a minister teaching a child that she watched a man go to Heaven was probably less helpful than having a therapist intervene. Pastor Frank couldn’t really teach me how to cope with memories of being trapped in a tilt-a-whirl car with a dead man and his shrieking bride-to-be for four minutes. But, Mum would say, it was the late 90s; therapy was for couples back then.

The way Mum tells it, you’d think that I was normal until the moment one of the bolts holding the tilt-a-whirl together somehow came loose, tumbling into the ride’s gear shaft and turning that topsy-turvey fun-mobile into a sniper rifle in three seconds flat. She’d tell you that she’d sent a carefree, jolly little girl to take the last open spot on the first whirl of the day between James Fairweather and his fiancé Carly Bonham, and took a blood-spattered, and very haunted child home. She’d tell you that I was silent for the rest of the day, and then just before she put me to bed on the bunk above Max in the room we shared, I looked at her and asked: “Mummy, why was the doctor trying to plug that man’s eyeballs?”

She’d say that she hesitated, and then tried to explain that they were trying to keep his blood in him so he could live. I guess I pondered that for a minute and then said, “yeah, but his smoke was coming out of his feet. They let all of the smoke out and he died.”

This would probably be the part where she’d stare at you for effect and wait for you to shiver, or comment on how creepy that must have been for her. These days, if I’m around when she tells it, I’ll ruin the moment here and remind her that she shouldn’t be sensationalizing the worst day of Carly Bonham—now Whiltshire’s— life. What I haven’t yet done is tell her that she’s wrong about a lot of that day.

James Fairweather’s death didn’t trigger the beginning of my “sight” or whatever you want to call it. I’d known I could see and hear things other people couldn’t by then. And I knew Fairweather was going to die that day because I’d been dreaming of his death for a week. Which is how I know I wasn’t at all happy-go-lucky waiting in line for the tilt-a-whirl. And if you happened to be watching on the other side of the fence as the ride operator led me by the hand to Car 4, you probably would have been able to catch the minute I realized that I was getting a VIP ticket to the splash-zone, because that’s when I started to try and pull my arm away. The operator mistook that for me moving to the wrong car, so he said “no sweets, this one” and pulled me along. I didn’t actually start crying audibly until the ride lurched to life, and Car 4 slowly took its first whirl before it’d pick up lethal speed. I don’t think anyone but Fairweather noticed, but when he did, he leaned forward and whispered, “hey kiddo, you’re okay— we’re gonna have a blast!” It was the last thing he ever said.

It’s funny though, that Mum worries about whether she should’ve gotten me a trauma therapist, because I don’t actually think about James and Carly and the tilt-a-whirl much at all. At least, I hadn’t thought of them until this morning when a call came through to the nurses station at a unit I was visiting in one of my regular hospitals.

The “knowing things are going to happen before they do” part of the catalogue of weird shit I can do is actually pretty small. It doesn’t happen often; I get blindsided by luck or tragedy just as much as the rest of the population—give or take a few extra sneak peaks—and up until today the tilt-a-whirl incident was the most memorable. Most of the time when it does happen, it’ll be hints about family pets dying in the reflections of store windows, or a cheerful buzzing in my ear just before a friend texts to say they got a promotion. Boring stuff; not often useful. Like, I didn’t know Max’s death was coming, and I sure as hell had no idea that he was going to hang around afterward, and over the last few weeks, especially as *this day* has gotten closer I’ve definitely been thinking about how a fucking heads up would’ve been nice.

Well, not to worry, esteemed audience, I got my warning today. A little late, sure, but I got it loud and clear.

At about 9 this morning— there was about an hour left in my shift—an LPN I hadn’t seen before with sandy blonde hair and freckles popped his head into a support meeting I was having with the adult children of a patient preparing for hospice. It isn’t abnormal for me to not recognize a nurse—I’m at three hospitals a week, not to mention specialized treatment centres— I’m not always going to catch a new face on the unit. What *was* weird is how the nurse acted. I’d set up shop in what the unit called the comfort room at the end of the hall and had a “meeting in session” sign up on the door. Nurses in palliative care knew to knock when they saw that sign, and only to knock if it was urgent. The LPN just opened the door, leaned in with a big ol goofy smile on his face, and addressed me like he’d known me for years.

“Hey Shelb, you got a call on line two— might wanna come grab that!”

*How the hell does this guy know my name?* I thought.

My clients were seated with their backs to the door and didn’t really acknowledge the rude interruption. I was thankful for it, because grief can be sharp enough to cut glass, or the world’s most effective numbing agent at any given point in time. The three of them could’ve reamed me out for the disruption. Looking back, I really wish they had have.

I sat dumbfounded for a second, both at what had just happened and at the fact that someone used the hospital line to get a hold of me when I always had my work phone on hand. When the LPN didn’t move, and continued to grin at me from the doorway in a way that grew more unsettling by the second, I cleared my throat, said “excuse me” and stood to follow the new guy out. He waited there for a second, like he wanted me to follow him, so I was a little weirded out when I’d made it halfway across the room and he pulled the door closed between us.

He wasn’t in the hall when I stepped out. I’m not gonna lie, it gave me the heebs, but I told myself he’d probably just dipped into a room to check on a patient, and walked—definitely faster than normal— to the nurses’ station. The woman who was usually holding down the fort there on my morning shifts— a wonderful RN named Elizabeth— was sat working on patient files.

“Hi Lizzie—new guy says that there’s a call for me?”

Elizabeth’s warm smile disappeared under a confused frown. “A call? Through where?”

“He said line two— stuck his head into a family meeting just now so I figured it was urgent.”

“Who’s this guy?” She asked me, casting a glance down at the landline closest to her. The on hold light was off.

“No idea,” I replied, “he had an LPN badge on, but I haven’t seen him before so I figured he was new.”

Elizabeth’s frown deepened “We don’t have any male LPN’s on shift right now, Shelby. As for calls—I’ve been sitting here since 8:30– I’ve only gotten a few updates from radiology. Are you sure he said nurses station?”

It was about right then that the tingling at the nape of my neck started. I cast a glance down the hall and back toward the comfort room. Empty.

I mumbled something self-deprecating to Lizzie about my work phone and end-of-shift brain fog and then took off for the bathroom. I didn’t make it there, though; I rounded the corner that took me from the palliative care unit toward the elevators and ran quite literally into the LPN.

“Woah *ho* Shelby! This ain’t a horse race, slow ‘er down! Did you get your call?” His voice was sickly sweet, like the host of a games booth at a carnival. I made no effort to hide my unease.

“There wasn’t a phone call, must have been mistaken.”

The laugh that came out of him was jovial— like Santa in his mid-twenties and every bit as upsetting as you’re probably thinking it is. The LPN put his hand on my shoulder, almost to steady himself. “Golly, no mistake here! You just didn’t catch the right receiver— let me help you!”

And then he pulled a Nokia—a fucking *Nokia—* out of the pocket on the front of his scrubs—scrubs that, I now noticed, were creased like they’d just been pulled out of shipping plastic and thrown on. With his left hand still on my shoulder, he flipped the phone open, and pressed a button. The phone beeped cheerfully. “Line two,” he said, and winked.

I had been feeling pretty weirded out by this point, but it was the wink that pushed me from slightly freaked to full-on afraid. It reminded me of Max on the gurney back in March.

Still, ignoring the sinking feelings in my gut telling me to *walk away,* I took the Nokia from him. And that’s when I caught his nametag: J. Fairweather.

I froze. There was no way. A coincidence, surely.

“Come on, Shelb,” he whispered, “give it a whirl.”

Shaking now, I put the phone to my ear. “H-hello?”

*“Do you remember how much that fucker* bled, *sissy*?”

No. The voice on the other end of the call was Max. I scrunched my eyes closed.

“What are you talking about?”

“*James! The day at the picnic! I thought for sure you’d remember him, he leaked all over you!”*

“Max, this isn’t funny. Are you still at the Centre?”

“*Course I am— just figured I’d reach out to make sure you were still coming. I haven’t seen you in* so long, *sissy. You never called.”*

I dropped the phone, then, staggering away from where it had hit the tile. When the spirited laugh I was expecting didn’t split the air, I looked up, only to realize that J. Fairweather was no longer in front of me. I was alone. And then the phone was gone too.

That’s when I made the run for my car. Texted a colleague and told her I’d gotten food poisoning, and then sped the fuck out of there.

Jamie’s still mad at me, and I know she is because I can hear her ringtone going off, but she’s not the reason I’m ignoring her calls. There have been texts coming through to my phone for the last hour from unknown numbers. The first one read: “Looking forward to catching up, sissy.” The second read: “It’ll be a mini road trip, like old times. We’re gonna have a blast!”

I did what any late-twenty something would do, then, and threw my phone into the back seat. Haven’t looked at it since.

I’m going to have to leave this JavaStop at some point. I don’t know what I’m going to do when that happens, but I guess I’ll let you all know.

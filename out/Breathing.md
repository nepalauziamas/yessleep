A memory came to me this morning from when I was much younger

My childhood home was haunted. Built sometime in the early 1900's, it was a small house that had definitely seen better days. My town was slowly falling apart and so my house went with it. My parents never had enough money to keep up with all the disrepair. That house didn't start looking nice until they moved out of it 18 years later. However, just because my house was falling about in a less than favorable location didn't mean it needed to be haunted.

I would joke with my siblings, being the oldest it was easy to come up with a scary story to creep them out. My mom would glare daggers at me and remind us it was just an old house. Old houses have personalities and make noises as they settle she would say to us. However, she never experienced the same intense dread I would feel at night while everyone else was asleep.

I shared a room with my sister, the room was so small, we could barely walk in there with bunk beds and a dresser. I slept on the bottom bunk and often got annoyed with her as she moved around jostling me from my slumber. I found reprieve when she would be gone on the weekend, I got the room to myself and much better sleep than any other time. However, that quickly changed.

Around the time I turned 12 I was staying up later to sneak my iPod while my parents were downstairs unaware. It was at this time that I realized I now hated sleeping in my room alone. I remember talking to some online friends about some anime which I had just gotten into when it happened. I could feel someone climbing up the ladder and adjusting themselves on the top bunk. I kept my head to the ladder because it faced the door and I hated the light that would creep in, but now I wished I had, just to see if there was something there. Or maybe if I had then whatever this entity was wouldn't have tried to get to the top bunk.

You don't know true intense paralyzing fear until you have experienced something unexplained. I had no pets and my other two younger siblings were in cribs with a shut door that they couldn't get out of. Something was up there and I didn't think I had the courage to check. In my mind, the thing wouldn't do anything if I put my blanket over my head and fell asleep. So that was what I did. For three months, anytime my sister left for the night (which mind you was generally every weekend) I would sleep with my blanket over my head. I thought that was fool proof until something changed.

Whatever it was climbed up to the top bunk, settled down and made itself comfortable. I had my blanket over my head like usual and for a couple minutes that was how it was. I was trying to fall asleep when I heard the breathing. It was a heavy loud breathing, like if you were trying to catch your breath. Maybe it wouldn't have been so bad if it weren't right next to my ear. The fear ran through my body like ice through my veins. I couldn't move, it was as if the entity was stealing my breath from from me for their own use. The mere thought of breathing while it was next to me brought out some deep guttural fear I had never experienced before in my life. I knew I needed to move and in the matter of what felt like milliseconds I was out of my bed and down the stairs. I don't know what made me do it but I told my parents I was just thirsty and came down for water. Nothing about a weird entity or something breathing next to me.

I have no memory of it ever returning after that.

However, I just got my first solo apartment recently and last night I could have sworn I felt something lay down next to me and some deep breathing on the nape of my neck before I passed out.

Edit: I used very vague language because I never actually saw what it was or investigated it in any sense so I can't pinpoint exactly what this energy was.

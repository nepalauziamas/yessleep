*Trigger Warning: Domestic Violence*

Okay so I wasn't sent the physical toes themselves (thank goodness for that, because what would I do with a pair of human toes?), but instead a high quality 4x6 picture of them freshly severed, laying on cement flooring near a grungy drain. The cuts were far from clean or surgical. The blood that had pooled around the drain was adding to an existing stain that I had grown very familiar with over the past few months. The picture was at the bottom of the box, underneath a shampoo sample, and some face cream that had a disconcerting  color and consistency.

This is my sixth box, so I guess it makes sense that they ran out of fingers by now and had to move on to toes.

I’ve tried contacting the company to ‘unsubscribe’ a few times, but something tells me that I’m not the one that decides when this particular subscription ends.

Let me give you some background, here.

I had just moved to a new apartment across town and was feeling like I could finally breathe for the first time in months. That is, until I found the note taped to my front door.

All it said was ‘found you’, with a sloppily drawn smiley face under it.

I knew who had written the note and I immediately broke down. I called in sick to work, moved a bookcase in front of my door, and sat in the dark with the blinds closed. I didn’t know how he found me. Again.

I didn’t use social media, I had asked my employer to keep me out of their online directory, and I avoided stores in our old neighborhood. Yet, he still found me.

I decided to take the note to the police since him being at my apartment at all was a violation of the protective order. Unfortunately, they couldn't do much since I didn’t have actionable evidence that he had been the one to place it there.

That evening I occupied myself by searching records to see when he had gotten out of jail – just weeks prior it turned out. I obsessively searched on how to avoid an abuser/stalker (how did he find me?), safety tips, etc. I didn’t really find much that made me feel better, unfortunately. I even looked at new apartments, but this time much further away.

I didn’t sleep well that night. Flashbacks intermingled with nightmares – at one point I thought I felt hands around my throat again, that I was quietly dying in the dark, and no one would find me, just like he had said. But no, it was just a nightmare this time.

Did you know that it actually takes a while to strangle someone and the victim usually just passes out first? I hadn't known that before I met him.

The next morning, I received an email that I almost deleted as spam at first. It was from a company I had never heard of before, and the subject line was ‘Re: Inquiry’

The email body said:

*‘Thank you for your inquiry. The AirTag is in under your spare tire.*

*Have a great day!*

*Tiffany G.*

*Customer Support Specialist’*

I was confused, I hadn’t emailed anyone – it threw me off enough that it took me a second read-through to process the line about the AirTag. I instinctively looked over my shoulder after I read it, as if the sender was lurking in the shadows of my apartment at that exact moment. My first fear filled thought was that he was behind this, but I realized that made no sense. Why would he tell me how he had found me?

I went to my car and opened the trunk hesitantly, almost like I expected something to jump out and bite me. Sure enough, it was there, exactly where the email said it would be. Not long before that, someone had broken into my car while I was grocery shopping. At the time I was more worried about the damage and relieved that nothing was stolen that I only briefly wondered about the motive. Now I knew.

I was thankful, but also weirded out and debating if/how I wanted to reply back to the email. Their motives seemed good, but I wasn't sure.

My friend, Kimmie, invited me to stay at her house for a while. She had literally just moved in days before, meaning it was one of the few places I could go that he didn’t know the location of. I threw the AirTag in the bushes near where my car had been parked at my apartment, and then packed the essentials quickly and left. I asked work for a few days off, since he would’ve likely known where my office was, too.

About a week later, I got a call from the police. He had been pulled over near my apartment, initially for driving recklessly, but when they searched his car, they found what pretty much amounted to a small armory, including an assortment of knives. He always had a thing for knives... I can’t say for sure what he had been planning but I have a good guess. He was arrested, but they said that he later just...disappeared... from holding.

I had another sleepless night. I couldn’t help but ruminate on something he had told me once: “Do you know what happened to Tiffany, when she left me?” he had paused, waited for me to shake my head no.

And then he flashed me a smile, “Yeah, neither does anyone else.”

He had shown me her grandmother’s locket that he kept in the safe in his closet, something I doubted she would’ve parted with willingly. Along with her teeth, and what was left of her fingertips.

The next morning I received another email:

Subject: ‘Your order is on its way!’

*‘Thank you for your 24-month subscription to \_\_\_\_\_ Beauty Box! Your order number is 05121.*

*Have a great day!*

*Tiffany G.*

*Customer Support Specialist’*

I hadn't bought anything, so I was worried that on top of everything else, my credit card number or identity had been stolen, again. When I first left him, he posted my social security number, birthdate, and credit card information everywhere he could online. I’m still recovering from that.

I checked with my bank, there were no pending charges. I was hoping there wasn’t another, different credit card that had been opened using my information (again). So, I replied to the email saying I didn’t order anything and I was worried someone was using my information. I asked if they could tell me the last four numbers of the card used to pay. It bounced back immediately as an invalid email address.

It was about a week later when the first box arrived. It arrived at Kimmie’s place, which was the first sign something strange was going on – I had never given anyone her address. Well, that, and the fact that the box had a picture of a severed forefinger and thumb under the beauty products.

One of the fingers had a tattoo that matched my own – or at least the one I used to have. We had got them when we had been dating for a while, but before I moved in, before he became violent. This had been back when he was still laying the sociopathic charm on thick -- I was young, I fell for it.

I say ‘used to have’ because I used to have ten fingers before I moved in with him.

The fingers in the picture – his fingers – looked to have been roughly severed, as if they had been sawed at slowly, with something dull and serrated – the thumb looked to have been removed in a vertical cut down to the wrist. Some of the skin hung in thin strips around the exposed bone and muscle. The bones themselves looked roughly splintered in places, as if someone had grown impatient with the removal process towards the end and just ripped away at what was still attached. The sinew that trailed unevenly from the muscle seemed to confirm that theory as well.

I was shocked and nauseated by the sight so I gasped and dropped the picture on the floor; Kimmie looked at me questioningly, so I showed her. The picture had a handwritten date on the back in thin looping cursive; it was dated recently, after he had disappeared from the jail.

I debated going to the police, but she was worried I might be the first (and only) suspect.

I googled the company name from the email and I couldn’t find anything, no phone number, email, or mailing address.

I did eventually open one of the products. It smelled terrible, and was made up of thick congealed liquid. It had no ingredients listed, a hand written label simply said ‘all natural’. There was a thick bar of a yellow soap with it, and it too had no brand or ingredients and an oddly greasy texture. 

I got a picture of two more fingers the next month. The date on the photo was recent and the fingers looked… fresh, not like they had come out of a freezer. When I showed Kimmie, her response was, “Good. Fuck ‘em.”

She knew all the details and reminded me that even if he never found me, even if I managed to avoid him while living the rest of my life in fear, he’d likely just find someone else. I wasn't the first; I wouldn't be the last. The police officers I had worked with had told me it is hard to keep that type of offender behind bars until they killed someone (and it could be proven).

She and I took the opportunity of him being out of the picture (for however long), to move me out of my apartment and to yet another new place. The manager of my old place was kind enough to not penalize me too much for breaking my lease.

I don’t miss living in constant fear of him finding me, but I never asked to receive pictures of him being slowly dismembered or strange smelling products sometimes marred with flecks of what I think may have been dried blood. By the time I got the picture on the third month, I couldn’t even open the box. Kimmie volunteered to, and described it to me.

I wasn’t even surprised. Am I bad person for not calling the police? Maybe.

I had ignored several boxes worth, leaving them stacked by the door because I’m not sure what to do with them. I opened this one, even though I was afraid of what I’d see, but I couldn’t help it. 

I'm slowly learning to live my life without the constant fear of him, but I do get anxious when it comes time to get the next box.

I still have 18 months left on my ‘subscription’.

I wonder what they’ll send me when they run out of toes.

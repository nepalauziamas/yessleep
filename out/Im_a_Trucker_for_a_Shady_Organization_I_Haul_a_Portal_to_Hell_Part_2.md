Assignment 23, Day 3, 12:00 noon

"Wakey wakey, we're here." The driver spurred me from my slumber.

Groggily, I sat up. Somewhat bruised and sore, the recent events came rushing back. "What are you!" I demanded, silently thankful to find myself intact after god knows how long alone with that thing.

"I dunno" they shrugged, sliding into a posh British accent.

"That isn't helpful," I scolded, unnerved. I reached for the weapon I had recently appropriated, tucking it into the back of my sweatpants. The cold metal pressed against the small of my back sent a shiver up my spine.

"Really? Is that any way to speak to the humble driver who completed your route?" They scolded, catching my gaze in the rear view mirror. "That pitiful peashooter won't work on me, chap," they stated, with a hint of sadness.

"You sound disappointed by that?" I blurted, slapping my forehead over my poor filter.

"Clever girl," the driver said, briefly slipping into an Australian accent. "Righty then, where to, little lady?"

"Ugh don't call me that, first. Second, scooch," I shooed them out of the way, taking control of the vehicle.

Translucent green signs appeared before us, directing me where to go.

"Bloody hell…" the driver trailed off, returning to a British accent. 

"I recommend shutting up. These guys aren't too friendly." I warned, feeling a vein bulge in my forehead.

"Cheers love, what's the worst that could happen?" The driver chuckled, miming out a toast and a shot.

"Wha-?" I spat, making a double take. The instant their lips parted, their entire appearance shifted. Instead of the mannequin body, there now sat a pilgrim looking, farmer's tanned, clean shaven man.

"Is this not low profile?" The driver fluttered their lashes in an entirely disturbing way, considering their current appearance.

"NO!" I half chuckled, half scolded. "Try something more… truckery?"

The moment I finished those words, the driver took on a slightly overweight, trucker hat wearing man with t-shirt tan lined arms.

"How 'bout this?" The driver boasted, raising a thumb to their chest. "Is the voice right?" The driver asked, singing a musical scale in a now perfect trucker voice.

I did not justify that with acknowledgement, instead following the directions to the drop site. I pulled up to the Victorian black iron gate, rolling down my window.

"Morning sir, I have a drop off for ParaPedigree." I called to the guard station.

"Ma'am, excuse you." The security guard corrected, then ordered "papers."

I produced the documents through the window, where she plucked them from my hand. With a 'fuck you' flourish, she scanned them over.

"You know the place," she growled, buzzing to open the gate.

Reversing to the leftmost bay, I disconnected the cabin from the cargo, then pulled forwards.

"What now?" The driver probed, watching through the side mirror as the receivers unloaded around the delivery.

"Keep your head down and shut up!" I hissed, throwing myself as low as possible.

All at once, screams erupted in a terrible chorus, the staccato of gunshots peppered in.

"Shoot, dammit!" One guard ordered, panicked.

"We're shooting, we're shooting!" Another cried, dread and fear palpable.

Twin primal roars boomed louder than a thunderclap as the guards whimpered in terror.

"Idiots." The driver sighed, not insultingly, but in an objective way. "They're all idiots."

I heard the click of the passenger door. Frozen on the ground, I couldn't bring myself to object to the driver’s actions.

"Oi!" The driver roared. "Come at me, ya bastards!"

Shots sprinkled the cabin as some guards turned their fire our way. The driver didn't seem to mind, but I was trembling. One well placed ricochet could end me. "Damn you driver!" I shouted. *If I died here, my last words would at least be good ones.*

My window shattered as something shot through it, landing inside with me. Hazarding a glance, I nearly fainted. A fucking head sat there, staring, slack jawed.

Beginning to hyperventilate, I thought I was going crazy as I heard and watched it speak.

"Be a dear and toss me out there, wontcha?" The driver’s head asked in an unfamiliar voice.

Breathing heavier and heavier, the world spun. This was batshit.

"We don't have all day. They're coming-!" The driver warned, cut off as something crashed on top of the cabin with a deafening **CREAK!**

A massive, meaty hand crashed through the passenger window, blindly searching for something.

The driver said nothing, looking at me and raising their eyebrows a few times at the hand.

With a painful, dry gulp, I grabbed the weightless head and hurled it out my window.

Instantly, the thing pounced from its perch atop my vehicle, shattering the windshield from sheer force. I did not have the courage to watch, covering my ears and squeezing my eyes as tight as I could.

I layed there for what felt like an eternity, waiting for the thing to claim my life. The driver's side door fell from the cabin, and I felt something cold pry my hand free and touch my ear.

I let loose a piercing scream, drawing the pistol and firing blindly at where I thought the thing was. The thing only twisted its slimy finger in my ear, undeterred by my efforts.

A cold hand pat my cheek, as the driver said "all clear."

After I remained frozen in the fetal position for a few minutes, the driver slapped me. "Ey, you're okay." They pulled me from the floor of the cabin, then set me carefully on my feet.

At some point tears must have begun streaming down my face, as my eyes felt puffy and stung. Wiping them a few times, I took in my surroundings.

I might've stood there, frozen for the rest of my days, had the saliva not dripped down my ear. Absentmindedly, I wiped at my ear. The driver snorted proudly.

"Wet willy, classic!" The driver chuckled to themself.

I was too stunned to argue.

The area was like a Picasso painting. Half melted body armor was fused to the ground, haphazardly scattered across the pavement. The remains of the guards oozed out from their armor, a purple goop sizzling as it sank in.

The first thing that crossed my mind as my senses slowly returned was *my heart is beating really damn fast* as I fell into a black cold of unconsciousness.

—

"Wakey wakey!" The driver announced in a chipper, sing-songway. That energy quickly depleted as I unload my stomach in an awful projectile, drenching them.

"Ugh…" I gagged, feeling another wave of nausea bubbling up. "Where are-what happened?!"

"Eh at your house, nice place by the way." The driver gave a thumbs up, then asked, "where is your bathroom?"

"Last door on the right-wait why are you in **my house** and how did you even get here?!" I demanded, pointing my finger at them like a bad dog.

Raising their hands in surrender, they said "would you rather wake up surrounded by those melted corpses?"

*They just had to say it!* My nausea peaked and another projectile sprayed the driver. They flipped me off the whole while.

Without another word, they marched down the hall and hopped into the shower. They're currently showering. Do I call the cops or something?

When I was 14 I had a strange encounter that still puzzles me to this day. On the weekends I'd sometimes go to my mother's place \[my parents were divorced by this time\]. The house she lived in was converted into several small apartments. It was a creepy old farmhouse, the house was at least 150 maybe 200 years old. My mom told me off an on of strange sounds she'd been hearing and seeing things in the corner of her eyes, feeling of being watched.

This one particular evening when I spent the night I brought my N64 because my mom would go to bed early and I'd still be up for a few more hours. I still remember to this day what game I was playing, WWF No Mercy. I was sitting Indian style on the floor playing the story mode. I just finished a mission in the game and set down the controller to the left of me, behind me. Directly behind me was a recliner. I'll never forget what I saw next. I went to grab the controller and saw what appeared to be a hoof, like a horse next to the controller on the floor. Insects and blood was coming out of the sliver that separated the hoof. I thought to myself, how strange. I slowly glanced up and this demonic figure was staring back at me, it leaned downed towards me, its face got down in my face and grinned the most evil smile. The eyes black, face red, one winged creature. Blood was dripping from its teeth. It was so surreal I immediately went into a panic attack and blacked out. I learned later it was the fight or flight response. Several seconds later I came to, laying on the floor, could barely move. The demonic figure in the chair laughing at me, it was as if my fear and energy had been sucked dry from me. I lost all strength. I did all I could to crawl to my moms room and woke her up. After I woke her up we talked and she believed me. She told me she'd too had seen the same thing earlier that week but didn't want to scare me. I don't know what to make of it and still think of it to this day. I have no doubt demons and angels are real and believe me the last thing you ever want to encounter is a demon smiling in your face.

My mother and her then boyfriend recall seeing this thing at my grandfathers house prior to moving to her farmhouse apartment. While they were laying in bed my mother smelled sulfur which then they'd seen this demonic thing walk into their bedroom, turned it's head towards them and let out a smile, it then disappeared. My grandfather acknowledge this thing was around but it didn't bother him as he ignored it. He's passed on since then. It was an open secret within my family that something dwelled on the land, this only proved it.

I don't care if you believe me or not but when three people see the same thing on two separate occasions, and when 4 people acknowledge it either we're all crazy or something is/was wrong with that old farmhouse and my grandfather's house.

I’m going to get straight to the point. Monsters are real. All of them. You might think you know a lot about them but you don’t. The stories and legends got so much wrong and I’ve had the privilege of getting to learn the truth about most of them. 

For example, no self respecting vampire would be caught dead - or alive - standing at your door waiting for an invite. And shapeshifters do not change once a month and howl at the moon. That’s just ridiculous. And the popular ones are just the tip of the iceberg. 

Do with that information what you will. 

One thing that the stories did get right, however, was the teeth. Sharp, crowded, tall, tiny. They all have them, and sometimes they need attention. A monster without teeth loses a huge percentage of its scare factor in an instant. It’s something they pay handsomely to avoid. 

That creature that’s haunted your nightmares, the one with a few too many teeth? Real. And probably in acute oral pain. 

My name is Dr Dayna Danworth and I own a dental practice for the paranormal. 

It wasn’t what I expected when attending dental school, to be sometimes shoulders deep in some of the most putrid and awful smelling mouths you’ve ever seen. But the opportunity fell into my lap and it more than pays the bills. The money is worth the risk and I get to live very comfortably.

Regardless, the risk is very real. I was reminded of that last night during my appointment with a new patient. It left me somewhat shaken; a rarity in my field.

Some of my patients are able to present as human for at least enough time to make it to the practice without issue. To the general public it looks like your average, private, city dentist and the daytime patients are generally the easier ones to deal with. 

This particular patient was not able to feign humanity. This meant overnight work, something that I was no stranger to but that I always detested. Overnights and the rare *home* visits generally always yielded difficult patients. 

Thankfully I was able to charge double for the inconvenience, triple if I had to travel. Often the astronomical price turned out to be entirely justified and this was no different.

My receptionist, Coco, had booked him in. I love her to pieces and she’s a true friend, who has the best of intentions, but she’s truly terrible at the basics of her job. She never collects the relevant information for new sign ups and doesn’t ask any questions that might prepare me. 

If it weren’t for her relentless charm I would have fired her years ago. But Coco has been with me from the beginning, has her own skill set and despite my frustrations she’s here to stay. 

Mr Eurastix was booked in for 11pm. He wanted the full cover of darkness for his arrival. That was all Coco knew. Blackout blinds down I prepped the room, knots forming in my stomach. 

“Dayna, do you want a coffee?” Coco shouted from the front desk, where she watched the security camera waiting for our arrival. 

“Water’s fine.”

“You’re mad aren’t you. I’m sorry Day. How the fuck are you supposed to ask someone what kind of monster they are? I feel rude.” Coco was always worried about offending, it was sweet, but useless. 

“You could at least ask what the problem is! Didn’t you learn from the incident with the woman of the water. Traipsed me all the way out to a rock pool with a bag of tools and no informa-“ 

My rant was cut off by the sound of the buzzer. My patient had arrived and he was stood just outside. Coco shot me a guilty and apologetic look and approached the door to unbolt it.

Within milliseconds she was floored and totally winded. The door was left swinging with not a soul to be seen. Great. 

I squinted, searching for a minuscule creature, or something translucent perhaps, but nothing. Instead there was a sinister, high pitched voice from behind me, inches from my left ear. It sounded like one of those cringe worthy, over enthused children’s tv presenters and it made my skin crawl.

“Nice to meet you Doctor! My name is Mosaph Eurastix. You can call me Mo if you prefer.” 

His presence cooled the immediate area around me and Coco wrenched herself up from the ground to bolt the door shut. I would’ve gone to help her, but I assure you she’d faced much worse whilst working with me and I felt there were more pressing matters in the moment. Instead, I turned to face my newest patient. 

I understood immediately the need for darkness. 

Mo wasn’t a big, hairy creature. He was far more humanoid than I expected from a patient requesting an overnight appointment. He wore a floor length hooded cloak swamping his seemingly average body. 

But Mo had a fleshy face.

He had striking red irises, with pupils that were shaped differently to a human. Over the top of his eyes was a thin, fleshy layer that created a veiny, translucent veil. As if an eyelid had formed but never separated, leaving him with his own protective eye windows. 

The same paper thin skin veiled the opening to his mouth, ever so slightly muffling his high pitched words and failing to conceal a perfectly circular arrangement of small, razor sharp teeth. His mouth didn’t move like you would expect, instead the voice projected from the back of his throat and through the skin. 

Where most people would be horrified, I was fascinated. There’s a certain point in an industry like mine where you’re entirely desensitised to the horrific sights of these monsters. I’d never seen one like Mo before. I wasn’t scared, more curious.

“Welcome Mo. I think you owe my employee here an apology don’t you?” I stared him firmly in the eyes. “Dr Danworth.” I stretched out a cautious hand. This was something I did often, I was always fascinated to see their hands. Mo’s were like mine. Except for the thin, veiny pieces of skin that connected each finger. It made a change from the array of claws I’d become accustomed to. 

“I do apologise, I was merely concerned that I might be seen. I didn’t mean to cause any harm! That could’ve caused some trouble.” He laughed.

The excess skin was everywhere. The more I looked at him the more I noticed. It covered his ears, connected his lobes to his head, covered his nostrils and seemingly his actual skin beneath it and even webbed his chin to what I presumed was his chest under the cloak. It was a mess. 

“Can I get you a coffee sir?” Coco beamed, unfazed as ever. It was the kind of moment that reminded me why I kept her around. Top notch customer service, however useless her admin was.

“Not for me, thank you. In fact that’s partly why I’m here, as you can see I have some restriction drinking at all.” He lifted his webbed hand, flesh covering the fingernails and stroked the delicate skin that covered his mouth. 

“Let’s get straight to it then, follow me.” 

I lead Mo into my treatment room, winking at Coco as a signal for her to keep an eye on the treatment room camera. He took a seat on the chair and I turned my lamp on. The bright light shining through the flesh made for quite a sight, illuminating the perfectly circular jaw underneath the clung on skin and creating ghastly shadows. 

“Please tell me a bit about yourself and what I can do for you.” 

“Woah. I wasn’t expecting a date doctor. What do you want to know?” His voice was cheeky and came laced with giggles but something about it still made my skin crawl. It was as if Mo sucked all the joy out of the room; some of them had that effect. 

“And you aren’t going to get one. But I need to know about your specific afflictions and diet etcetera in order to treat you correctly.” I watched as Mo became visibly uncomfortable at the prospect of explaining what he was. “Don’t worry, there’s no judgement here.” 

“Well doc, I don’t always look like this for a start. It’s never gotten this bad before. Usually the skin appears... then it hardens and... I eat it.” 

He looked at me as if I was supposed to be in some kind of deep shock, but I’d kept geckos as a kid. When a gecko sheds its skin it does it in one go like it’s taking off a tiny cardigan, then they consume the remains. It’s highly nutritious. Mo’s red eyes were quite reptilian. I stupidly thought at that stage that I had him all worked out. 

“So you need some assistance with removal? I work with teeth Mr Eurastix, not the rest of the anatomy.”

“You just need to cut this, doc.” He nonchalantly pointed at the flap of skin stretched across his circular jaw. “The rest should dislodge easy then you can get to work on the teeth.” 

“And what appears to be the issue with those?”

“Isn’t it obvious? I did tell your receptionist.” Mo rolled his red eyes behind their horrendous fleshy windows.

*For fucks sake Coco.*

That’s what I thought but I didn’t say it. I would never lament her in front of a patient. I inspected what I could see of the rounded jaw and gathering of pointed teeth through the lamp and tried to ponder what he could possibly want. 

“I’m sorry, Mr Eurastix, but I haven’t worked with anyone with your particular afflictions before. You will have to bring me up to speed.” 

“Well I don’t subsist entirely on my shed, doc. My teeth were designed for a purpose but they’ve lost their... edge. Part of the reason I’m dealing with all of... this.” His eyes brightened with a ravenous hunger and he pulled at the skin connecting from his chin.

“So you’re looking for a sharpening? May I ask what you eat?” 

I was curious. I make it my business to catalogue each monster that I work with for my own personal research, but I couldn’t liken him to any other. He wasn’t reminiscent of even an old urban legend. I couldn’t place him but over the years I’d come to understand that most were defined by their bite. It was always a good starting point.

“I eat brains.” He answered in the most unassuming voice I’d ever heard. 

I’d had worse, but this was new. Was he what your average person might describe as a zombie? I had been certain that they were nothing but a myth. I would’ve regretted it had I not asked the question but that still didn’t prepare me for the answer.

“No!” Mo laughed a high pitched, false and cold laugh. “What I am is *far* worse than the laughable construct of a zombie. All we share is diet. Nothing more. Now I think it’s time you got to work, doc.” 

I gulped but didn’t respond. I picked up my scalpel and prodded at the excess skin covering his rounded jaw with the point. Despite its delicate appearance, even with force it remained infallible. Within minutes I found myself viciously stabbing at my patients mouth. 

Yet another occurrence I hadn’t expected in dental school.

I placed the scalpel down and walked over to the locked cupboard in the corner of the room. It was the one I used to house my *special* tools for special cases. Mo didn’t even flinch when I returned with a diamond tipped drill in my hands. 

My second attempt was more successful. The drill met some resistance and created an awful noise in the process, but after breaking a sweat it finally pierced the layer, sending grotesque blood and unidentifiable matter across the floor.

The smell that filled the room was indescribable. I dropped the drill on the side as I heard Coco gag at the front desk. It almost stunned me enough to stop me catching Mo’s next move. 

Each flap of excess skin started to pull and tear away from its position on his face and hands, moving upwards from beneath his cloak and making it very apparent that he was covered head to toe in the stuck shed. 

He sucked in with the ferociousness of an angry Henry hoover as he consumed his own flesh as it ripped to reveal fresh, raw skin. The scene was truly horrific. But as the thin windows of skin peeled away from Mo’s eyes to reveal a brilliant scarlet he looked truly satisfied.

That’s what I want right? Satisfied patients. 

Placing a new face mask over my mouth and nose I attempted to combat the smell that had saturated the first one. 

“Better?” I asked, as Mo slurped the final bloodied pieces of himself down. He nodded with glee. 

“I can’t wait for a real meal now. I’ve been sooo hungry.” He looked at me like dinner. I held in vomit as I tried to get a look at his now unobstructed teeth. 

“Well if you want to enjoy a real meal then you won’t make one of me before you’re teeth are done.” I laughed nervously and he delighted at my discomfort. 

“Are you scared of me Dr Danworth? I thought you were experienced. You came highly recommended by the Beast of Cordyline Hill.” 

Of course I did. I fucking hated that guy. He was the patient I always dreaded and now he’d sent me another living nightmare. 

“Not at all Mo, just a joke. Shall we move on with the sharpening?” 

I could see that he knew I was lying. Although he couldn’t contort his circular mouth it was in the eyes. I’ve found that even in the most monstrous of eyes there is emotion. People say that they’re windows to the soul, but they’re also windows to the soulless. 

I picked up my file and got to work. 

The jaw was solid and perfectly fused into its shape. Lining the entire edge were around 80 roughly three inch long, incisor shaped teeth. They had clearly been blunted with time, but it didn’t make them or him any less intimidating. 

They sharpened up with ease. Grinding against them I felt like some sort of Classical Greek sculptor. Carving my masterpiece.

I tried not to give too much thought to the poor victims that would fall prey to those particular teeth. I couldn’t work out how he got to the brain but I was certain that it wasn’t pretty. Nasty, but natural. Think of it like the food chain of the animal kingdom; it’s just the part no one talks about.

I put my all into my work and soon found myself faced with a perfect set of monster gnashers - if I do say so myself. 

“You’re all done Mr Eurastix. Would you like to take a look?” I lowered the circular mirror slowly and he snatched it from my hands at a similar speed to how he’d entered the practice. It took me aback a little. 

With his red raw hands he ran his fingers along the jagged edges of his teeth, checking that each individual one was to his liking. It made me incredibly nervous, watching him scrutinise my masterpiece. 

“They’re perfect.” He uttered under his breath. 

I smiled sweetly, determined to get the patient out of my practice and into the world... away from me.

“I’m glad you think so, you can make payment at the front desk with Coco.” I turned my back to him to tidy my equipment for mere seconds. A rookie mistake.

Seconds were more than enough.

I felt a harsh pulling on my hair accompanied by suckling noises. It was painful, each individual strand being tugged hard from the end, roots snapping. Fuck. I screamed. The slurping noises coming from behind me intensified. 

*THUD*

With one final tug on my hair Mo hit the floor and I turned to see Coco standing over him with a large ceramic tooth that usually decorated reception. She dragged him out of the treatment room and into the entrance as I tried to tidy my hair with my fingers and compose myself. 

I tried to remain professional but I found myself hyperventilating.

“What do you think you’re doing sir? The doctor here provided you a service, now please pay up and leave.” Coco bit at him the moment he opened his creepy eyes. These were the moments that I was best reminded of the reasons she retained her job. 

Mo looked up at her in shock, steadying himself on his raw hands.

“I’m so sorry, I don’t know what came over me doctor. I’m just so hungry, and I’m sure you’ve got such a juicy brain.” He stared me dead in the eye with his bright red irises and extended an equally bright red tongue, licking each sharp tooth gently. Menacingly. 

His tone wasn’t genuinely apologetic at all. Desperately shaken I waited with baited breath as he reached into his cloak pocket and handed a stack of cash to Coco. 

“It’s time you leave Mr Eurastix. I can recommend a colleague in the industry for further appointments but I won’t be continuing to treat you.” I opened up the bolted door and gestured for him to leave. 

“Oh doctor, whether or not you treat me we will meet again, I assure you.” 

After a lingering glare Mo lifted his hood to cover his face and stepped outside into the dark night. 

My relief soon turned sour. I hadn’t noticed the drunken gentleman walking along the path, but Mo certainly had. 

I watched in abject horror as he grabbed the man by both shoulders and latched on hair first to the back of his head. The man screamed in pain, pleading. The awful slurping noise was unbearable. 

I ran towards my patient but before I could make it outside to try and help he latched his ring of fangs around the man’s scalp. The bite was followed by an almighty crunch, deadening the screams. 

There was no hope for the man. 

Mo slurped at the inside of his crunched skull as if it were a delicious fresh oyster. He moaned and groaned with intense pleasure as he chomped down on the contents of the head. When he was finished he dropped his victim to the ground, hollowed out, and turned to me.

“Thanks doc, I feel so much better now. I’ll tell the Beast you said hello.” 

He practically chirped those words. Then he was gone. Disappeared. 

Mo had moved so fast and destroyed the passer by with such deadly precision; I realised that if he had wanted me dead then I would have been. And his final words, about the Beast. It made me wonder if the Beast of Cordyline Hill had sent him in the first place. 

Coco made a call to PSEC, or for those who don’t know *The Paranormal Services Emergency Cleaners* to dispose of the body. They were swift and professional... as always. 

It’s terrible, but this hadn’t been the first fatality on my watch because of a patient, and my guilt was unfathomable. 

Today I’ve spent hours pondering why I continue to do this job. Why I put myself at risk of death on a nightly basis. But in all honesty it’s quite simple. My fascination just won’t allow me to quit. 

Adding my notes on Mosaph Eurastix to my research files I felt electrified. [Another monster for my collection, and I can’t wait to find the next one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePickledGnome/)

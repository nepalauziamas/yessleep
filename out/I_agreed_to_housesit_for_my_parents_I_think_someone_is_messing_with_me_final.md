I arrived back in Dallas last night from a conference, the First Annual Utopian Expo, outside of DC that I attended last week.

Of course that conference had to fall on the same week my whole family went to Disney. I was bummed I didn't get to meet my youngest niece.

I had gotten to the luggage carousel, before I realized my phone was still on airplane mode. I switched it off and stuck it back in my pocket. It buzzed.

"Your post hit 100 upvotes" the notification from Reddit said.

I don't normally post on Reddit, so this was strange. I opened up the app and saw a series of posts on r/nosleep talking about me house-sitting for my parents.

That was crazy because I haven't been home in 12 years. I don't have anything against my parents, but after I left for college, it never worked out that I went to see them.

Also, who hacks someone's account to post on Reddit? I could understand spam, but these were posts that were getting interaction and upvotes. Free karma, I guess?

I spent the Uber back to my apartment reading the first couple posts, and finished when I got upstairs.

Honestly it's crazy how believable they are, aside from the crazy ghost and monster stuff. Whoever did this had to know me and really intricate details of my life.

They knew where my parents lived, my siblings, my uncle, even about Mr. Smiles, who I really try not to talk to people about for what should be obvious reasons. They knew the layout of my childhood home.

Perhaps the weirdest of all, they know how I think.

There were points in the story where I found myself knowing what it was going to say next before I read it.

I don't know if it's scarier to me to think this story really happened, or if someone is able to basically read my mind.

I clicked open my laptop and decided to Google the convention I was coming from. I typed in FAUX, the abbreviation for the conference, and the feeling I was being screwed with got a lot stronger. I decided to use the full name of the expo instead.

I guess I was being paranoid, because First Annual Utopian Expo was on the first page of results. I clicked through the pages and the website seemed legit, but the content wasn't making sense to me.

"Come see the ways people are striving for a better tomorrow"

A banner read.

What was this expo? Why would I pass up on a trip with my family for this? I had just spent a week there, but what had I done?

I guess there have been other conferences I have come back from that just blur into ambiguous scenes of me sitting in a room being lectured about "the next big thing in (insert conference topic here)"

Utopias though? The heck?

I called Jerry.

"Hey Phil how was your flight?"

"Not bad, how was Disney?"

"Oh I couldn't go. I had a work thing."

"Oh... Hey are you feeling all right?"

"Never better, but hey Christine is calling me to come help with the kids. I'll give you a call back soon"

"All right... I love you Jer"

"Love you too asshat"

He clicked off the call.

Okay, Jerry was all right, so the story had to be lying, right?

When I was unpacking my suitcase, I found a note scribbled in my handwriting that said "Find the bearcat, tell it to give you back your memories, ask questions later" with my signature at the bottom. Bearcat had been crossed out, and something had been scribbled above it.

"DORK" maybe?

Not only had someone hacked my account, but they had slipped a note into my bag to try to reinforce the story. That means they had physical access to me as well.

I went to lock my apartment door and almost decided to throw out the note, but I figured it would make good evidence if I needed to file a restraining order.

I brought the note to a locked fireproof and waterproof box where I keep some important documents. I opened it and saw a manila folder with the word EVIDENCE written on the front.

That seemed to fit, and I dropped the note in the folder. I was curious what other types of evidence I had collected, and flipped through the documents.

There were a bunch of hand written notes saying things like "it's pork" or "mom and dad behind it" or "stay away from home" or "Rebecca". There was a polaroid picture of a little fuzzy creature, maybe a bearcat, sitting on the porch of my childhood home. There was a photo of me and a beautiful woman I had never seen before.

Someone had managed to break into my apartment and plant this in my locked box.

I got worried that this may actually be a trick to keep me out of the way while my parents were robbed or something. I called my dad.

"Hey dad is everything okay out there?"

"Yep, Disney was a blast"

"I'm worried about you and mom. I think maybe it's time I come out there for a visit."

He laughed "yeah, son, it is about time. How long has it been?"

"Must be 12 years now"

"Yes, that sounds about right. How about you come down next month? That'll give us some time to get things ready for you. We'll invite your siblings too"

"I'd like that. See you then, talk to you sooner"

I was feeling a bit better, when I happened to check my Google Drive. I say "happened", but the Reddit posts were still bothering me. I use Google Docs to draft up papers for work, and it seemed like a place I would edit these before posting them.

The other posts were there in a folder titled STRANGE, but there was one more that I think was meant to be the final entry. The file was called "Four Conversations."

I am going to include the content from that file below. I'm not sure if I wrote it, but it seems to be the end of the story you've been reading.

**************************************************

I thought I would have more time to write this, but as you'll read, today flew away from me, and there's one last thing I need to do.

I left off at coffee with the creature. I could make a podcast with that title.

We ordered. I got a vanilla latte, and she got that new tropical drink, which was unexpected.

We sat at a table staring at each other for a few minutes, not really knowing what to say. She was a normal looking person: brown hair, thin face. I might guess she works as a clerk in a convenience store if she hadn't just tried to murder me a few times.

"Do you look like this to avoid detection or something"

"Th-th-this is how I l-l-look normally."

"Oh" awkward.

"It's unc-c-comfortable to stay ch-ch-changed."

A pause again.

"So you naturally stutter? That's why you don't fix that?"

She glared at me. "I d-dont normally sp-sp-speak English"

Hearing that somehow made sense to me. The stutter started to sound more like someone reading off of Google translate, trying the sounds out before committing. Oddly, she didn't have a noticeable accent. A touch of a valley girl accent if anything.

"You're very r-r-rude." She said after a time.

"Sorry, I'm just not sure what to talk about"

That wasn't the right thing to say. She stopped mid-sip and slammed her cup on the table.

"Y-y-you don't kn-know what to t-t-talk about? How about m-m-my daughter?!" She whispered so loud it was almost still a shout. The barista at the counter looked our way.

"You're drawing attention. What about your daughter?"

"S-shylin, you took her from me."

"I don't know any Shylins-"

"S-shylin."

"I don't know a S-shylin."

"Sh-she was on th-th-that farm. I s-s-smelled her in that C-C-CAGE!"

Did she mean Ruth? That seemed to be the only explanation. On some level, I had assumed that this _was_ Ruth, but the strange occurrences of the past week made a little more sense if there was someone else involved.

"I think you mean my sister, Ruth, but I don't remember her"

"S-she is not y-y-your sister."

"Right, well my dad 'adopted' her. At least that's what my brother, Jerry, said... before you killed him" I tried not to let myself get too mad at that point, but suddenly I remembered who was sitting across from me.

"Your father stole her!" She snapped, then continued as the rest of what I said sank in "I k-k-killed? I d-didn't kill anyt-thing"

"You may as well have. You stabbed him with iron and forced out his soul, I think. To be honest I'm not really sure how it works."

"Th-th-that thing in the p-p-prison? That was an ab-b-bomination. I p-p-put it right."

"Yeah well your daughter made him like that"

I explained what Jerry had told me. Ruth probably killed him, Ruth made the body, and my dad had come up with some ritual to bind him to the body.

"Mm, S'shylin m-must have been t-t-too weak to make a p-proper vessel."

She went on to explain that it's easier for her species to change themselves than to manipulate other organic matter. The closer something is to another, the easier it is to change it. The creature, I guess I should ask her name, said she would have been able to create a body out of a tree or another plant, but Ruth must have needed the major organ systems in tact. That also explained Jerry's remaining abilities with poison.

I briefly wondered if that meant my nephews were half chicken-dragon.

"So you could bring Jerry back?!" I interrupted her, suddenly excited.

"Wh-why w-would I?"

"You killed him. You owe us."

"I didn't k-kill him, and y-y-you took my d-daughter."

I tried to explain what I knew from Ruth's file. I don't think my dad knew that Ruth had a mother or behavioral patterns of her species; he saw a creature in need and tried to help it. I explained how the enclosures in the basement she had called "the prison" were to protect my family and the other creatures from hostile creatures with unstable abilities.

She explained that it was her fault that she and Ruth had been discovered. She would transform into funny creatures to entertain Ruth as a child, and one day she had been seen by a neighbor. That neighbor had called the cops, but the incident appeared to have been going nowhere because "I saw my neighbor transform into a 
platypus" isn't usually taken at face value.

The mother had decided to relocate anyway, under the guise of being enraged that she had been targeted by her neighbor because she was a single mother. She didn't think anything had come of it, but the NSA had been figuratively knocking at her door within a month.

The day Ruth was either kidnapped or rescued by my father, depending on your perspective, her mother had been out fighting off government agents near their home when my dad showed up.

I think I must have gotten through to her, because the rage she had shown while hunting me down had visibility dissipated. I could tell that hearing her side of the story was building some rapport between us.

"Ruth-"

"S-shylin"

"S-shylin is with my parents right now. They will be back soon. If I agree to get my dad to talk to you, will you help me bring back Jerry? I'm sure if he hears your story, he'll want you to have your daughter back."

"I d-dont know anyt-thing about g-g-g-ghosts, b-but I can m-m-make a b-body."

That would have to do.

"I'll figure out how to get him into the body. If you meet me back at the house tomorrow afternoon, we can do the ritual and you can stick around to wait for me to pick my parents up from the airport. I'll be able to talk to them about you before we get home, so they're not caught off guard."

She agreed, and we parted ways peacefully.

Time had gotten away from me and I was already running late to lunch with Uncle Brian. I called him on the ride over to let him know I was still going, and he said he was running late too actually.

I ended up getting there first. The diner was an unassuming building with a metal roof, a few Harleys outside, and a blue door. It hardly looked like a diner, and the sign on the door that said "21 & up after 8 pm" ended up giving the place the vibe of a biker bar rather than a diner.

I grabbed a table, ordered a pepsi, and waited for my uncle.

When he got there, it didn't take long for the conversation to take a turn for the worse.

"Phil! Man, what has it been 4 years since I seen you? Had to be the last time your folks asked me to help you watch the place."

My uncle was a big guy, but more bulky than fat, that smelled of cigarettes and had a mostly gray beard down to his chest. I would bet money his bike was now parked out front next to the others. Whereas my dad had a slight southern accent he tried to conceal, my uncle had embraced his accent and nurtured it into a full drawl. They grew up in the South, maybe Georgia? Neither talked about childhood too much. My uncle lives in northern Georgia now.

The important thing here is that it had been nearly 15 years since I had seen Brian at my grandfather's funeral.

"You must be thinking of Jerry or Zeke. I haven't been back here since college."

"Bahaha" my uncle booked "you're down here at least twice a year. I guess you at least got a break during COVID"

"What are you talking about?"

"Ah, I told Paul he should stop this crap with the memories. Glad to hear he's still not listening to me. Well I guess I should tell you again not to order the pot roast, you usually like the reuben"

I didn't like where this was heading, but I did order the reuben and did like it. My uncle ordered the pot roast. Let's just say I'm glad I didn't.

"You're telling me that my parents just have me watch their house and then wipe my memory"

"That's bout the size of it. Usually they get that thing they call your brother to supervise or leave it to the tin cans"

"Why would they do that? Why do you have your memories?"

"No clue, but knowing my brother, he's experimenting on you or something. I still have the scars from when we were kids." He took a sip of Sierra Mist, "As for the memories, I just keep away from the little fuzzy guy he uses to wipe the memories."

"How do you know all this? You've seen the bearcat?"

"You would know ten times more'n me if you had your memories. As for the fuzzy guy, I'm sure you've seen him too, they let him right in the house with y'all. Treat him like a dog. Call him Pork." He laughed "he is a little chunker"

My mind was swimming. I could ask him so much more, but I knew the best answers would be from my own memories. I knew how to find the bearcat now, and I knew how to get my memory back when I did.

We let the conversation shift to normal stuff: his bike, work, and a brief foray into politics that we quickly dropped before getting in an argument.

"What ever happened between you and my dad?"

He sighed

"Well, do you know about Jerry? What he is?"

I nodded, not correcting his tense to "was"

"I disagreed with your parents bringing that creature into your home, even before Jerry was born. It was too dangerous. They really built their whole compound because of that thing.

"When Jerry passed, I blamed Paul. When the haunting started, I wanted to try to send him on, let him find peace. Your dad wanted him back. I don't blame him, but he got into some dark places. I've never seen him like that before or since. The way he wanted him back... it wouldn't be Jerry.

"Eventually I found out that creature had managed to turn Jerry into a creature too, and my brother had him locked up like an animal.

"Well I broke into his little basement lab and tried to get Jerry out. I'm not proud to say I still considered putting him down, but when I saw the kid back I couldn't do it.

"Your father removed my security access that day and only puts it back when I'm there looking out for you. You're my only real nephew left. He knows I can't let you run around that place unprotected, so I come running like his little lap dog whenever he calls me and tells me you'll be staying."

There was a lot to unpack there, but one thing had caught my attention.

"What do you mean I'm your only real nephew"

"Well there was Jerry, but he's something else now. There's you, the spitting image of my brother. Then there's three little creatures those two decided to...adopt"

"Zeke and Sarah?"

He nodded, but offered no further explanation.

I filled Brian in on the events of the past few days, and what I was going to do when I got home. I let him know about the Reddit posts. He was hesitant to let me come back alone, but he looked like a mess.

I guess I didn't mention it earlier, but he had a black eye, a bandage wrapped around his head, and one of his arms was splinted. He still looked like he could kick my ass into next week, but he might injure himself in the process.

I told him it's better for me to do the next steps alone, but that he should follow the Reddit updates and that I would call him if things went sideways.

He covered the tab, and we left. I saw him hop on his bike, a cherry red '72 Norton Commando he had restored himself as I pulled off in the truck.

I took a pitstop to grab dinner for later and headed back to the house.

I parked and went in the front door, ready to find Pork and get my memories back. Pork was standing on the stairs making eye contact with me.

"Crap" I said, and then I blanked out.

Obviously, I am writing about this, so spoiler alert, I got my memories back, but pretty recently.

From what I can tell, Pork mostly just erased my memory that he was a memory-altering bearcat. I think he may have also removed the memory of my uncle telling me I had been here before. Having my memories now, it's hard to remember what I didn't remember before I remembered.

I definitely _did_ remember that I needed to bring Jerry back. I considered going into his room again, but my shoulder was still hurting from the block hitting me earlier.

Anyway, I think he had given me a hint already. The blocks had read SMILES for a minute there.

It was getting late, so I worked through the routine for the dogs and went to bed a bit early.

I woke up this morning and wrote my last post. I'm sorry I had to cut things off, but I had no idea what a Jerry resurrection ritual would entail. Turns out, it's a good thing I left early.

I ate a breakfast feast of toast and butter before heading out of the house in the direction of the family cemetery.

 At some point, my dad had decided cemeteries were scams and had an acre of our interior land consecrated. Most of the construction or farmland on the property was towards the boundaries to keep the interior land natural, though there were still footpaths through the property. The cemetery was an exception.

In a natural clearing in the woods of the property, there were a handful of headstones, there was a mausoleum that was hopefully still empty a few yards from the tombstones, and there was a large wall with plaques and photos near the tree line.

There were very few people buried here, although a few more than there should be apparently. Those people were marked with tomb stones.

There were many animals buried in this area and the surrounding forest. Some I had buried as a kid, usually planting something on top to mark the grave. The wall served as a general memorial for the animals, each marked with a plaque and photo.

The mausoleum was nothing extraordinary, just a small cement building, in which my parents would be entombed. This is strange for them, as I imagine they would prefer a "return my nutrients to the earth" approach, but my dad had an irrational fear of being accidentally burned and/or buried alive, hence mausoleum. He told me once that he wouldn't mind being moved into the ground after he's been dead a year or two.

There was a little bench off the footpath by the tombstones. The cemetery was at least 2 miles from the house, so the bench was a nice place to rest.

When my grandfather was buried here, there had to be 2 sets of pallbearers so nobody got too tired. Everyone was panting when we got here.

I scanned the tombstones in the tall grass, and it wasn't hard to find what I was looking for. Both of my grandfathers, one of my grandmothers, someone named Rebecca, and:

MR. SMILES

Etched in it beneath a pair of googly eyes and a plastic mouth that had been glued to the tombstone. The eyes seemed to peer out from the tall grass.

"Kind of garish if you ask me"

I hadn't asked anyone. The voice came from the bench behind me.

Mr. Smiles sat on the bench.
Rather Randall Schmidt sat on the bench, with no trace of his haphazard mockery of a clown suit. I thought he might be alive for a moment, but the wood of the bench was faintly visible through his chest.

"Mr. Schmidt?"

"In the flesh" he laughed

"Why are you haunting me?"

"That's not a generous interpretation. I tried to warn you about Ruth. I broke you out of your dream cycle. I helped you escape the basement. Hell, you're here to ask for my help. Haunting?!"

"You've been terrifying me in dreams!"

"I don't get to choose how you interpret what I'm sending you in your dream. You want to blame someone, blame your own mind. Frankly I'm offended." 

His head twisted around 360 degrees, when he faced me again, he wore the goggles and plastic mouth.

"What's so scary about Mr. Smiles?!" He asked in his high pitched cartoon voice.

"See that's terrifying. Please stop that." I said, keeping myself from peeing my pants

He shook his head furiously and when he stopped he was back to normal.

"You liked it better when you were a kid. Go ahead and ask what you came for"

"Jerry. How can he come back?"

"You can repeat the ritual your dad taught Ruth. You just need his totem, a suitable vessel, and the blood of a sibling."

"The what?!"

"Calm down not a lot of blood, what you have in your socks should be enough."

When he said that, I noticed for the first time my sock was wet, and the dull stinging in my foot had become a sharp pain.

My wound from the piece of glass had reopened when I was running from Ruth's mom the day before, and I guess it had opened again at some point in my two mile hike. I sat next to him on the bench.

"What's the ritual?"

"It will be easier if you just let me do it. Plus, I know about your web posts, and I'm not about to let you publish a ritual for forcing a ghost into a living body online."

"How would you do it?"

"Well in much the same way we will bring back Jerry. We'll put a ghost in a living being."

Mr. Smiles directed me to the guest house to collect his original googly-eye goggles and plastic mouth from a drawer in one of the closets. He told me Jerry's totem used in the original ritual was a puka shell necklace that could be found in his luggage.

The totem was what kept Jerry's soul bound as a ghost, and even when in his body he had to keep it close. His connection to his body weakened as he got farther away from the necklace. Presumably he would have worn it either if he was a preteen surfer boy or if it weren't a puka shell necklace.

The goggles and lips were Mr. Smiles totems, and would allow him to possess me, as long as I was willing, without a ritual.

I met Ruth's mother at the house, where she was swinging in the porch swing.

I wish I could say more about the ritual, but basically, Ruth's mom made a body out of an old oak tree. We carried it up to Jerry's room and put it in his bed, with the puka shell necklace on. I shoved my bloody sock in its mouth. I put the goggles on, and blacked out.

When I came to, it was getting dark and I was laying out the couch downstairs. I don't know where the goggles went. Jerry is upstairs in bed breathing, but still appears to be asleep.

I thought at the time maybe my memories had been wiped, but now they're all back and I still don't know what happened. Ruth's mom had left, I think, before we started, not wanting to be involved with the next part.

I got ready, typed up my conversations with Ruth's mom and my uncle, which I had to go back and edit with my memories restored, and took off for the airport to get my parents.

My dad called me while I was waiting in the cell lot. This was the first audio contact I had with my family since the weird call with Sarah the other night, but my dad had texted me to confirm flight times earlier today. Considering that, my dad seemed pretty nonchalant as he told me the carousel number to pick them up at.

I drove over and, of course, had to loop around again when they weren't outside, but they were there on the second pass.

My dad drove back and a few minutes into the drive, after discussing Disney and the grandkids, he said.

"Well this time was a mess, huh? Between your mother sneaking Ruth on the trip and you trying to release Armageddon, this has to be one of the worst attempts on record."

I didn't speak for a minute. There was a lot to process.

He continued, "Why in the hell would you release all those critters? They weren't ready." He glared at me in the rearview.

"It's a long story."

"It's a long drive"

I told him the story up to this point, at least what I remembered. Most of it didn't surprise him.

"You managed to bring Jerry back again? You convinced the Fleischbildhauerin?" He asked

"I hope he's back. He's sleeping in the room upstairs."

"And she is waiting for us back home?" He glanced at my mother.

"Yes she wants to get Ruth back."

"Okay, we'll handle her. Anyway I'm glad to hear you opened the pens in a state of emergency. You may have even believed you were saving them from a 'monster'" the word monster having audible air quotes around it "when Calero told me, I thought it was another one of your acts of rebellion"

"Who is Calero?"

"Good friend of mine. I asked him to take his team and keep an eye on you. Because of their early alarm, we were able to get most of the animals rounded up within the first 12 hours with minimal casualties. There are stragglers, but it could be much worse." He paused. "I take back what I said earlier, this may have been one of the most successful attempts yet."

Honestly, I think part of me had released the animals as revenge on my dad for not telling me about them. I had panicked, but even right after, I was thinking about how mad he would be. I didn't tell him this though. 

I wasn't happy to hear there had been casualties, and I didn't know if they were humans or creatures. I don't think there's a difference to my dad.

"You keep saying that, what are you talking about? And you had someone spying on me?"

"Well, son, I want you to take over the rescue business for me. I'm getting a bit old for new acquisitions, and I want to train you up while I still can. I'll be honest with you, we've tried this before and you've been unreceptive, even destructive, but this time you seem to be stepping up. We had to wipe your memories of those times and try again. All those trips you've been taking for the past decade or so - Paris, London, New York - well they were actually right at home."

"You...you wiped my memories? I have pictures from those trips."

"Photoshopped, we even deep-faked a video of you in times square one time. You don't think it's strange you never heard from any of the people you met on those trips again?"

"That's... you're insane! How can you do that to me? Why wouldn't you just find someone else?"

"You're my son, biologically, and you've inherited my immunities. Anyone else would be dead in a week. Calero's team was only able to get any of those creatures back because your mother had already conditioned them, and even then 1 of them died in the process."

"Dad this is insane. Why would I have turned you down to begin with?"

"We usually get to this part of the conversation, one way or another. We've been wiping your memory since you were a kid, we kept you in a containment cell for a while, and you felt betrayed, which I can tell that you feel now."

"You've been manipulating me my whole life, and you think betrayal covers what I'm feeling? I'm confused, pissed, how am I supposed to-"

"1, 2, 3" he cut me off and started counting. I felt frozen, the emotions sapping out of me.

"Baby, can you get him under control? I'm driving tired already, I don't need the emotional overload."

She smiled softly and turned to face me.

"Honey, I need you to sit quietly for the ride, stay calm, and when we get home, go up to your room and stay there while we deal with the creature" she turned back to my dad "Ruthie is our daughter now, we'll protect her."

"Yes mommy" my mouth said, but I didn't have control of it anymore. I was a passenger in my brain.

"You're right, son, but the rules apply to you too. I can't let you hurt the other creatures. You're still in an enclosure. Yours is just a bit bigger."

We rode in silence the rest of the way. When we got home, my body walked up the stairs to my room and locked the door. 

At that point control flowed back into me, and I tried to open the door and go warn Ruth's mother. When I put my hand on the door knob, I lost control again, and my body backed away from the door before I was in control again.

I slouched to the ground and leaned against my bed. Pork came over to me and licked my face. I closed my eyes and counted to ten to try to get my composure back.

I opened my eyes, and saw a bearcat staring at me.

"Give me back my memories!" I almost yelled.

They came back. Years of memories, dating back to childhood like my dad said. Too many to write, but I knew now why I had refused him.

I had a fiancee, Rebecca, who had come with me to a Thanksgiving at this house. One of my dad's newly released creatures must not have been fully ready. Rebecca was murdered, and my dad had buried her right next to where Smiles is buried. I had seen the tombstone earlier today and not known who she was.

I presume he must have done something to keep the police from questioning me about her disappearance, and I wondered if her family even remembered that she existed.

The memories came flooding in all at once. Our first date, the way she brushed her hair to the side when she smiled at me, a road trip we had taken to a couple of the national parks and Niagara falls, proposing to her, losing her, and even worse, forgetting her.

I would have guessed that this would feel like watching a movie. Sad, but as if it happened to someone else. The emotions were complete, however, sharpened by years of being unable to mourn or grieve. I was sobbing, and I have been writing this through years and anger so there can be a record of what happened.

There _had_ been other times I had been here, and when I regained this memory, I had gone full villain.

I had tried to kill some of these monsters, and had succeeded. I had once tried to burn the place to the ground. I had figured out I have the ability to project my emotions, probably some untrained version of my mother's ability, and had used it to set one of dad's teams loose on a rage-fueled rampage in the basement. I had blown up the security robots, which then had just looked like robots, which presumably gave my dad the idea to make them look like family members.

I had become a monster, something to fear.

I am about to do it again.

I still can't leave the room through my bedroom door, but there's another way out. The door in the closet is calling my name, and it's time I got my revenge.

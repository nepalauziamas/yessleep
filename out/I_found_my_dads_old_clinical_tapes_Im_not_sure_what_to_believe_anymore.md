On to the matter at hand, I guess.

------------------------------------
Last week, I woke up to find my dad tossing a bunch of junk out of the crawl space behind our unoccupied guest room. His arms were moving in a way that I can only in hindsight describe as bizarre and rushed. He had been clearing the shelves of ripped rags, moldy childhood toys, and lingerie my mom must’ve worn in the 80s. He was mumbling to himself and didn’t hear me approach until I cleared my throat. When he finally turned from the dank space, he didn’t seem like himself. He looked disgruntled. His eyebrows creased, hooding over his baggy eyes. 

“Oh, hi. I didn’t know you were up,” He said, rubbing his fingers over the piling that had built up on one of mom’s old, ivory-colored bras. He seemed to have lost himself for a moment before wiping his hand over his mouth and rubbing the tension out of his forehead. His gaze met mine, “What’s up? What! Why ya lookin’ at me like that, Martha?” 

“Like what?” I asked him, genuinely concerned, “Like someone who’s been woken up at 6 A.M. to catch her old man practically *making out* with one of mom’s old bras?” 

He laughed reservedly, “It’s been hard… we were together for 24 years.”

“I know, dad. I’m sorry.” 

“And then she just… left. Like *that*. Finds someone new, someone more successful, more under control, more… together. And I’m left *here*. Holding the same bra she wore to our first Martha-makin’ appointment!” He smirked slightly and tossed the bra near a crinkled trash bag he had laid on the carpet to the side of the crawl space. 

I pretended to gag, “Euw. No. Just no.” That made him chuckle-- a real chuckle this time. He stood up and smacked some dust remnants off his shorts, 
 
“Should I make us some breakfast while we’re up? We need to be in class by 8:30, anyway. We’ve got clinical reviews today, and I have one student who is, quite frankly, way too young and lost to be in a 700-level abnormal psych seminar. Ha. Nepotism.”

I smiled knowingly at him, “Ha. Sure. Eggs with a little cheese on a slice of rye? Thanks.” 

“Coming right up, Cap’n!” 

“Oh, and by the way, dad?”

“Yeah, Martha?”   

“It’s not nepotism if the professor in charge spends his free time panty-raiding. If anything, I’m doing charity work for the disgraced Dr. Kolapore.”

“Whoa, whoa. You got a bite like your mama. Ease off, Mar.” Dad looked more than a little hurt by what I’d said, but I couldn’t take it back. He defeatedly turned away, roaming toward the direction of the kitchen. I plopped down where he had been kneeling and scanned the small darkness of the crawl space. Dust. Webs. Mildew. More old shit from my childhood: boxes of home movies, binkies, a cracked porcelain doll with a tattered denim dress. I held that sad doll for a moment and examined it... it was ugly. 

I thought about degradation and the lead role it played in my life. I had a world that had remained mostly unadulterated, peaceful. I had a whole family. Then, a small crack surfaced. A secret propagated. An affair led to divorce. Naturally, it destroyed any sense of stability that ever existed. Degradation, whatever it truly is, doesn’t care about feelings. It leaves everyone around it trapped and nauseated. And that’s where I am, currently. I’m a fractured piece of porcelain, left with a dad who only seems half-alive some of the time and a deep aching for a mother too selfish to ever have cared about how her actions affected me in the first place. 

I hear dad humming lightly downstairs, and I’m severed from my self-pitying. I stop examining the doll and throw it toward the trashbag dad had left on the floor. It lands face down. It still looks ugly. 

I use my phone’s flashlight to shine a light on the hidden spaces of the cramped storage area. I notice an inconspicuous shoebox and carefully reach for it, dusting away spider legs from its lid. It was a peculiar little thing, labeled with barely legible black ink. I opened it and discovered that it was filled with old cassette tapes. Each one had labels with similar scribblings, such as ***C556 Session 1: J.K.***, then followed by another labeled with Session 2, and 3, and so on.  I figured they must have been dad’s old client films from his graduate school days. My curiosity was piqued, especially since I wanted to be like dad one day. I’d counsel my very own clients and prescribe them medications. I even thought that maybe one day, I’d teach my own psychology class at University; I’d be lionized by my students, just like dad.

I’m sure it can go without being said that I watched the shit out of that first tape. Once I had found that shoe box, I immediately snuck upstairs to my room and located the Sony Digital 8 Megapixel that dad had passed to me on my birthday last year. I figured the thing was old, but my God I had no idea just how old it was until I inserted that first cassette. Wide-eyed, I watched the static that peppered the camera screen. Soon it faded into a dark mahogany room, dimly lit by a small ornamental chandelier, where dad, looking very young, sat in a black leather armchair across a man lying in an equally antique, chocolate leather, chaise lounge. The man looked to be about the same age as dad at that time-- possibly late 20’s to early 30’s. Both of them had mustaches. 

Dad wore a cream-colored linen polo. The man-- the client-- sitting across from him wore what I can only describe as a *very* bizarre get-up. It looked like he had on a massively wrinkled fringed, suede vest and unevenly ripped bell bottoms. I could see his knees. They were bony and bruised. His dark brown hair was unbrushed. He had a seriously frightening look about him. I wanted to be a psychiatrist, but I couldn’t imagine having this man as a client… ever. 

Dad twirled his pen in the tips of his fingers and placed it in his mouth slightly, clearly waiting for the client to say something. The man across him fidgeted a lot, shaking his knees and running his hands through his hair in distress. I wondered why he was *so* uncomfortable. Then, finally, he said something.  

“I’ve always been an alien,” the man said without an ounce of emotion, his eyes unblinkingly transfixed on dad, “Always floating on the outskirts… and yet, I am safe. Maybe others are happy, but they are vulnerable. They are blind. They are unassuming and do not question the world they think to be *reality*,” he made air quotes with his fingers. Even from far away, I could see he had bitten them raw, probably from anxiety. Quickly, the man looked toward the ceiling, the upper left corner of the room. Suddenly, I remembered learning something about lateral eye movements in one of the psychology classes I took last semester. He was an audio-visual thinker; he believed in what he was saying very deeply. I guess you could say he had a sense of conviction, no matter how off-kilter the things he said may have seemed. 

“They don't realize I’m not a fool. I can feel them all around me! They’re lifeless puppets. They presume they’re safe… that what they experience are their *own* feelings. They refuse to acknowledge what I already know. We are controlled! They’re in the darkness, and I’m forced to watch! Always. That’s all I can do, really,” The client looked back toward my dad, this time a bit more disheveled. Then he looked straight at the camera… at me… “Hey. Hey! Are you listening to me?” Chills cascaded through my body. I did not like this client. 
 
Dad spoke calmly and evenly, “Yes. I am listening, Jerry. Would you like to continue?”

“I guess.”

"Okay. Can you tell me what happened today?"

“I woke up looking at the painting on my ceiling. I painted it right after I saw the truth. It reminds me of what will happen to me. My destiny, you could say.”

"What’s in the painting?"

“A number: five-five-six.”

"Five hundred and fifty-six? Why is this number representative of your destiny?"

“*Five-five-six*. It follows me.”

"What do you mean ‘it follows’ you?"

“It protects me from becoming susceptible to others’ suggestions. I use this number often.”

"Is this why you haven't been going to work?"

“Yes. Also, people do not like me, so I avoid them when I can.”

Dad nodded as if he followed anything the man said, "Mhmm..."

The client continued, “I am interested in the thoughts that others are thinking of me. Often, I cannot be around them, as I know that they will whisper. Their words are like fractals that they refuse to split, though I take this extra step because I think they do not want me to. I can see the meaning of their words, and thoughts, and slightest movements at the microscopic level, even. Their shapes are never-ending.” 

This man seemed seriously ill. However, if dad thought so, I couldn’t tell even one bit as he casually continued to question him, "Hm. I see. Well, how often do you find yourself thinking about five-five-six?"

“I always do, but… it isn’t able to affect you. Don't worry.”

"Can you explain this number to me a little bit more? I am very curious to know how it’s related to your destiny."

Suddenly the man’s brow furrowed-- almost as though he felt he had been betrayed. He scanned the room and slunk into himself, raising his hands up as if to prevent from being restrained, “I smell something here… an odor.” 

“What sort of odor?”

“It’s insidious. There’s something evil here.” 

“Jerry, can you tell me what you smell?”

“No. I can’t tell you. You already know.”

“Well can you possibly ignore whatever presence you feel for the time being? I’d really like to hear about this number.” 

“I always find my gaze fixed upon the oven in my kitchen. I find myself staring at its cold, steel exterior. It disturbs me.” 

“What about your oven disturbs you?” Dad had let himself get derailed by nonsense. I was surprised at that. Usually, he’s all calm and cool, especially with his clients. I guess we all have to start somewhere. 

The client responded flippantly, “It’s not *my* oven.”

“What exactly about *that* oven disturbs you?” I figured dad must’ve been frustrated with this guy. I wondered if this had really been their first session, or if it had just been the first one that had been filmed. Then I wondered how he got consent to film this guy in the first place. Jerry was quite the rough customer. That's what dad calls clients who are unbearable to work with. 

Jerry continued the harangue, “The way the oven’s overhead lights shine upon its surface... the shapes that it creates… they’re all oddly proportional. They circumnavigate when my body interferes with the light’s reflection. They change. I travel into space. I spin. Eyes, then neck, then torso. arms. I try to calculate each movement as if I know the perfection of my existence relies on them. I experience my consciousness individually *and* from the perspective of each part of my body. The light does this to me. I become like the shapes on the oven. I am drawn to it, and yet, so repelled by it. Its energy frightens me very much. I don’t know who owned it before me, but I must get rid of it before they come back for it.” 

“I see… have you talked to the rest of the family about what’s been happening?”

“I told my mother. She doesn’t like when I speak of these things, though, so I stopped. I don’t talk to anyone else, well except you, now. The rest of them make me uncomfortable. Don’t tell anyone about this, Doug-- not even Shelby.” 

Then confusion hit me. The client knowing dad’s name wasn’t that unusual, but mom’s? It wasn’t like dad to disclose personal information to his clients. Hell, it definitely wasn’t kosher to have clinical tapes in the crawl space, either. Yet here I was… infiltrating this Jerry dude’s life like he were my own patient. 

Throughout the entire session, dad remained unfazed. And utterly unfazed, he continued, “Have you told anyone else about this … special number… five-five-six?”

“My mother and my supervisor. I had to tell them… and now I’ve told you… Hey, what are you writing? Are you writing about me? Don’t write that number down. Hey! Don’t write it! I can see you writing it!”

“Jerry, I have to write it down. I need to remember it in case we discuss it again-- I mean, in case you feel comfortable sharing more about it… Jerry? Where are you going? Don’t leave, I can cross it out. Jerry!” 

Suddenly Jerry had left the screen and dad had begun to fidget with the camera lens. Then the image cut out. The peppery static ensued, and I was left with my breeding uncertainty. 

It was at this point that I decided to delve deeper into this case. I wanted to know what had happened with Jerry, and I had 4 more tapes to find out. I inserted the second one labeled, ***C556 Session 2: J.K.***, into the camera. Once more, static pixelated across the screen. Then, I saw Jerry alone, pacing around a compact kitchen. To the left, there was a boxy titanium sink. To the right, a fridge. The video definition here was much less clear than in the mahogany counseling room. It looked like Jerry actually had *no* idea that there was a camera on him. I saw mostly just the top of his head. The thing I found most peculiar though, was the fact that Jerry seemed to be wearing the same clothes in this video as the previous one. Yet, he didn’t seem to be doing anything fully out of the ordinary-- just pacing and occasionally checking what appeared to be the evening news. The camera rotated with him when he sat on the hunter-green love seat in his living room. I was slightly surprised to see that the area seemed to be well-maintained and adequately designed. 

I heard a short quip from the anchor. He had a crisp baritone voice and a suit that had clearly been professionally tailored. “There will be a fifty percent chance of rain tomorrow, folks. You better bring your umbrella to keep you nice and safe!” The crisp voice smiled a crisp smile and crisply transitioned to his co-anchor, a beautiful blonde with perky boobs. I couldn’t help but roll my eyes. She smiled widely and introduced the next segment, “Up next we have an exclusive interview with Daniel Kleine, writer of the *New York Times* bestseller, '*Oxygen. What your body lacks*'..." 

I studied the back of Jerry’s head, engrossed, as he scrutinized the animated cycle of poorly-marketed infomercials. He scratched at his nail beds and jittered his knees a bit. He seemed to be mumbling to himself, but I just couldn’t make out the words. Whatever he was saying seemed to escalate his anxiety though, because he began frantically examining the living room walls-- probing for God knows what. Then instantly he stopped scanning; he stood straight up, arms at his sides, palms facing the T.V., bare feet separated a hips distance apart. *Time for a moment’s mountain pose?* I chuckled to myself. *What a weird freaking dude.* 

I thought about turning the tape off to get ready for class but suddenly halted when I noticed something unsettling. Jerry had turned away from facing the T.V. and now was positioned toward me. He began creeping slowly. First, around the couch, hands motionless at his sides, as though he were possessed. Then, he slinked toward the kitchen. His eyes were wide with fright and suspicion and .. and.. he was approaching closer to the lens. He was sweating, breathing heavy, strained breaths. Inhaling and exhaling and creeping, still. Staring at me, his wide eyes approaching even closer now. His mouth parts slightly. A low hum leaves his throat. It sounds like muted rage. It sounds like terror frozen in space. His voice is at a whisper and it impales me. It shreds my insides, “Something very bad is going to happen.” 

With that, Jerry swats at the camera one, two, three times, and makes contact on the fourth. Crash! Clank, clank, clank. The video goes dark. I sit there in awe. Thoughtless. Paralyzed. My brain is an intolerable liquid. It begins seeping out of my ears until all that’s left is a faint ringing noise. The world is white. My fingers shake as they move to grab the next cassette…

Then, dad calls me downstairs for breakfast, “Martha! Let’s go! Eggy time!”

I’m snapped out of my orchestral catatonia. “Coming!” I holler back. The eggs are dressed with cheese and slain over the rye. Just as I asked.

“Martha, why aren’t you dressed?” Dad interrogated, “What’s wrong? Why do you look like that?”

“Like what?” I evaded his glance by stuffing some egg into my mouth, “Oh’m fohne dahd.”  

“Okay. Well, you *can* swallow your food before you lie to me, you know.” He looked hurt again. I realized I could do no justice to explaining what I just saw, so I played the role of the insolent daughter. 

“Whatever.”

“Look, just be ready to go in 30. I’ll be upstairs getting dressed. Meet me in the car when you think you’re done. O.K.?” 

“Alright,” I said it quietly. I hated to hide it from him, but I just felt… uncertain. 

He rose from where he sat and marched slowly toward the steps. 

“Dad?” I said it and he hesitated, obviously hoping for me to open up. I couldn't. “Thanks for breakfast…” 

“Oh,” he looked away again, wiping his mouth, “Sure. Love ya. I’ll meet ya in the car.” 

I couldn’t face him after that. I ended up going to class in the sweats I wore to bed. 

On the car ride over we didn’t talk at all. It was fucking awkward. 45 minutes of pure nothingness. But this is where we left it. He seemed off and I didn’t really have anything to say to him… just questions. Even during class, he seemed distracted. It was the first time I had seen him like that since mom left. It made me feel horrible and so fucking guilty. And the car ride home… was *unbearable*. He grunted a few words of “not my best work today…” and “Thomas was quite annoying with all those questions today…” And all I could muster was, “Yeah… but Thomas is hot.” He did laugh a bit. I’ll give him that.

But when we parked he dropped me off and told me he had to run a few errands. I figured he didn’t want to see me for some time after the way I acted this morning… but I just couldn’t help it. I was thrown by those tapes. And, I had to see more. 

I dashed upstairs to my room, tripping over my feet with anticipation. I needed to learn more about Jerry and five-five-six and *why* those tapes existed in the first place. I just couldn’t imagine dad having anything interesting to hide, you know? It was *mom* who hid everything from us. When she left he was in shambles, and *I* had to pick our family up. Move us forward. Drag us through hell. *She* left. Fucking coward. 

But now I’m not so sure, and this is why I’m here. I’ve been fighting myself all week to post this. 

When I got upstairs, I found nothing. The box and the camcorder were gone.

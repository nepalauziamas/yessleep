A couple months ago my seven year old brother moved into my room. Ever since he moved in he wakes me up at 3 am saying "I heard a scary noise" or "I'm scared brother". Now my parents room is around the corner but it would be to much trouble helping him to them and I usually go to bed late so I just let him climb into my bed and we fall asleep together.

I noticed that he always wakes me at the start of the witching hour and it was kinda freaky. One night I was playing games with my friends a little later than usual and got into bed about at 2 am. I was too excited to fall asleep so I pretended to sleep, fake it till you make it right, but as time ticked closer to 3 am the air started getting colder and everything started going silent to the point where I could hear the grandfather clock wich is on the opposite side of the house.

My window started to creek open and the chilling wind that blew in left a sour taste in my mouth. As the clock struck 3 am my brother got out of bed and climbed into mine. I'm still pretty awake so I decided to take a quick glance around my room and then I saw it ...

There is a figure so tall it's head touches the roof, it's body is slender and darker than night it self seeming like an ink stain on dark grey paper. It lifted it's bony hand to showcase his inhumanly long pointed fingers they seemed to be half as long as the body.

Terrified at the sight I pretend to roll over so as not to stir suspicion in the creature. Time ticked slowly by, the very air became anxious as the creature just stood in the furthest corner of my room next to a window. It stood statue like and staring in my direction. Too afraid to close my eyes I glared at it expecting it to do something nightmarish and then vanish into the approaching dawn but it just stood there occasionally scratching it's chest.

I roll over to face my clock and with a shock I noticed that almost no time passed at all, only 5 minutes has passed since that thing entered my room. Trembling in my bed I refused to take my eyes off it. Then it moved, slowly making it's way to the foot of my bed, it's feet dragging over the carpet with every anxiously slow step in my small room.

When it reached it's destination it leaned over, it's head hovering over mine. Petrified in fear I layed there clutching my brother in my arms fearing what the creature would do next. Then it spoke... "Look me in the eye" sounding like a snake as hissed with the wind, still petrified I kept my eyes shut as I heard the nauseating wet sound of flesh tearing open.

Feeling as if an intense pressure was placed upon me, I struggled to gasp for air still keeping my eyes shut when it started to feel as if the creature was wrapping it's tongue around my neck. Afraid to move a muscle I layed there anxiously awaiting what happens next... at some point my cat entered the room creating quite a ruckus meowing and hissing at the creature.

With a horrible shriek the creature's tongue uncoiled from my neck as it skittered out of the window it came in closing it same way it opened it... I wake up in a cold sweat at 6 am to find my brother in my arms and my cat sleeping at my feet with my neck feeling extremely stiff.

My day went as normal, thinking the events that took place was just a dream my exhausted mind cooked up. As night came around I decided to do a little test. I created an unbroken line of salt on my windowsill stretching between the two sides of the wall. After doing that my brother slept in his own bed for as long I left the salt line was unbroken.

Unfortunately with it being summer I had to open a window now and then too cool down the room and I nearly forgot about everything that happened. I decided to play games on my phone till 2 am only stopping due to feeling a bit drowsy. The salt line as you could imagine was blown away by the wind and the events of that night repeated like clock work as if rehearsed countless times.

Forgetting to make the salt line a couple days in a row I decided I'm going to give this creature a taste of silver, when my grandfather passed his silver bracelet was passed on to me, not thinking I'm going to use it as a weapon one day. 

I took quiet a nap during the day so I could stay up the whole night, 3 am came and I already had my bed open for my brother, he crawled in and continued to sleep as I sat upright with my legs stretched out. I kept my eyes closed as the scene unravelled as usual but this time when the creature's head was inches away from mine I gave it an upper cut of note.
The silver bracelet wrapped around my knuckles and my fist connecting square with the creature's jaw. It released a screech of agony as it fell backwards and unbalanced. It's eye flashed open alowing me to gaze into the cycloptic void centered in the middle of the creature's face where a blinding light bled out into the dark room.

In It's eye I only saw nightmares, visions of the apocalypse, the assortment of demons under our beds and the sight of our inevitable demise. Entranced by these visions I sat petrified as if having gazed upon medusa herself. Tears swelling from my eyes as I do not blink and shiver in horror. If my cat had not chased the creature away I fear that this story would not have been spread.

Every night at 3 am I fear for my life as the creature returns haunting me and whispering "Why don't you look in my eye again". I warn you all beware the creature that comes out during the witching hour. If you value your life and sanity you shall head my warning!

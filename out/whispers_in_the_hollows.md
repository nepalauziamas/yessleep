 

How can I truly define evil?..... After all these years of trying to forget?! Even now my fingers shake as I try to write this… I have wronged you and I'm so sorry! What I have done was unthinkable, and now I really wish to have these nightmares end… so maybe if I tell the world your story and my sin…we both can finally be at peace…Im so sorry christy!! It all started in my home town of whisper hollow, a small community of people who believed their home had become cursed after the death of annabelle chambers.

Annabelle’s life was a sad one, and her tale is even more so…. While the town will have you believe she was a heartless evil witch… she really was just a misunderstood girl who had been sheltered by her parents. The chambers themselves were an odd bunch, as they wouldn’t leave their home and the only time you saw them was during a full moon dressed in a strange outfit. But Annabelle was different….she never showed interest in their strange ways, but when you have the family name…no one will trust you.

It was a chilly Halloween night that changed the town forever, while sneaking out dawned in an old fashioned ghost costume…. A group of local children had Annabelle yanking the sheet from her, then pushed and beat her as she screamed for help….by the time a police officer had gotten to the scene Annabelle was the only one standing… as the children laid dead with their inside scoped from their chests.

The town’s quickly covered up their sins that night….as they did something unthinkable Annabelle was dragged into the woods near her home, and hung by her arms from a tree as they took turns slicing into her skin letting her bleed out. Now this is where the story should end but the town also sinned twice that night, they set fire to the chamber’s home while they slept burning everyone inside.

Those monsters covered up their sins…..by saiding Annabelle was taken into custody by local police and hung herself in jail….as for the fire well… accident right?.... Since then the town has been plagued with a deadly curse that is believed to come from Annabelle or her family. I was only 10 when I did my horrible sin and lost one of my best friends due to it, and it all started on a halloween night one I will never forget…even now the images haunt me… the town’s halloween party big was a deal as everyone gathered for dancing, games and trick or treating in town.

“Wow look at this bag…I can barely hold it” april said looking at her candy, she was the sweet tooth of the group alway had something sweet in her mouth. Grabbing a sucker she pops it into her mouth as her eyes wide with excitement “oh god…so good!” Beth just shook her head, “god get a room… we don’t see you make out with your candy” she mocked as april just held up her middle finger. “Ok ok guys cut it out….” Christy said throwing her bag over shoulder, she was the adult of the group and never got much of a childhood…her father left them as a baby and she had been helping her mother since.

I was the gothic chick in the group, I loved horror in general so anything dark and twisted really got me like a kid in a candy store. “Lighten up christy…” unwrapping a piece of candy and throwing it in my mouth. The town really outdid themselves with lights shaped like purple and white ghosts, towering horrificing figures looming over you as well… for the weak of heart well this would be too much of scare…but  it was the town’s haunted house that was the big ticket every year, the witching hour they called it. 

“God….it’s not that scary” Beth said rolling her eyes as we walked from the exit, she wasn’t wrong as the town would dull the scare and tell the wrong history of the chambers through the scare house. “Oh come on…what did you expect?” Christy said, almost bored taking a drink from her water, Beth just shook her head not answering as she normally did. We started our walk toward our house as the night started to come to a close, the music died down and the light on every door fading. Beth and April talk among themselves, as Christy just seemed quiet..but that was normal for her, “i'm not ready to go home yet” april cried picking at her candy. 

Now there is one true statement about who I was in the group…. Troublemaker the town knew it too as my parents would get calls about something I did or a prank I pulled. “Who said we were going home..” I said with a grin across my face, of course Beth and April looked happy when I had a plan…but christy was the only one with a look of hate. “Emily…no we promised we would go straight home..” The three of us just looked lost, but we knew Christy would not change her mind.

Once we all said our goodbyes, I laid in bed looking at the ceiling of my room “emily…you awake?” My mother stood in the doorway dressed in a red evening gown as my father looked down at his phone. I knew they do this every year while the town had something for kids, they had after hours party  for parents…. Of course I never minded, “yes…” I said, sitting up grabbing my candy bag from the floor.

“We’re be back after midnight….please stay home and don’t do anything stupid” my father said as my mother nodded in agreement. I nodded a bit annoyed, but knowing talking back to them would make them stay longer than I could bear. Once alone I grabbed my phone and texted the group chat soon april and Beth was online and ready to hear my crazy idea…it didn’t take long for them to agree to the nightly visit but christy had no interest in letting us get in trouble. “No emily…did you think about what danger we could be in?!” she wrote as I rolled my eyes \`\`fine..you stay home but i'm going..” I said as April and Beth both agreed without question.

It was about 10:30 when I waited by the park gate, it was quiet and yet my eyes seemed to dart in which direction. “BOO” I jumped but turned only to see April and Beth laughing at me, “good one…guys well you ready to go see a real haunted house?” “not without someone to keep you out of trouble” Beth walked up looking a bit annoyed. “I'm not going to get us…” I stopped christy’s look alone told me not to pull it. Walking on the back trail of the woods, we tried to stay in view and finally knew we were safe when the gates of the manor stood before us.

“Hey guys…that the tree that Annabelle was hung from” I said looking toward the girls “they said you can still hear her cries in the wind..” April and Beth only looked fearful leaving Christy only rolling her eyes and laughing. “Ghost stories…that all they are” christy said walking closer to the gate, she pushed but nothing would come open. “Guys follow me, the gate is locked tight but I had made an opening further down” we walked the length of the gate until a small cut opening could be seen. “How long have you been planning this? '' Beth said, almost excited, “oh since the first of october…I cut this opening while my parents were at work” I was proud of myself…my plans away were perfect…well maybe almost perfect.

Once on the chamber’s land we noticed the fire damage and age make any of us feel uneasy, but my mind was excited as we explored the place where death and decay was all around us. “Ok can we leave now…” christy said “no…we haven’t explored inside the house..you know it didn’t burn all the way down” april and beth also looked unsure for the first time since we had arrived. “I'm not so sure what it falls on us?” April looked closely at the walls and broken windows that still stood. “Ok fine…if you want to be pussies and wait out here..but i'm going in” a bit annoyed and upset I knew my heart was hurt by their words. 

“Damn it emily…fine we go in for a few minutes..then  we go!” Christy said, pushing past me looking for a safe opening.it wasn’t long before she found a safe window to climb into, grabbing the flashlight from my bag we explored the living room, it was beautiful from what we could see.only the half the house stood now leaving us to look at the living room, dining hall and some odd looking rooms. “Shit well upstairs isn’t an option….” Beth said, sounding let down, it was true part of the stairs looked burnt and ready to fall apart. 

“Ok we've been here long enough…” Christy said heading toward the opening we came from, “wait…look at the basement” I said as April and Beth both jumped for joy at my news. “Christy please…I promise we go home after this” christy sighted as she walked over heading down the stairs after us. The room was dusty and an odd smell caught our attention, “fuck what the hell..” april said covering her face. My eyes went wide, noticing some skulls landing on the floor near an odd looking symbol, “her family was witches” Beth said in wonder. 

We spent an hour exploring the basement, that was where I found annabelle’s notebook..the town had wronged her. A small black notebook laided on a table, the page was torn but I could read the words, this was an account of her life and yet she never approved of her family activities. “Guys she was a normal girl like us” I said reading as the group gathered around listening to me read. I only wish this part of the story was false and christy was still alive but, I did something so unthinkable.

“Ok let's do one more thing…” I said pulling out some candles and a blanket “hell no..this where I cross the line” christy said almost hatefully.  The other two just looked lost but nodded sitting down around the candles “fuck…why I hang out with you guys” christy joined us knowing nothing good would come out of this.  I laid the notebook in the middle of the candles and started to call out for Annabelle, asking her questions and begging her to speak to us. 

“Nothing happening..can we please go” a sudden sound made us jump and I knew then we were being watched, we bolted toward the steps leaving everything behind…. Once outside we hid watching the opening. “Fuck this…” I said pushing past the group “Emily where are you going” april called, I could then hear them following after me “christy…fine let go..you win” I said but my eye went wide she wasn’t with us…just april beth and me. 

We looked everywhere for her, and yet I feared she was still inside… “we have to tell someone…maybe they can help” Beth said almost in tears,” NO…this stay between us” I didn’t know what I was saying…maybe it was fear for once in my life. We ran back through a small opening of the gate and headed toward the wood, “um…..emily…..I “ Beth and April both looked panicked as I turned to a figure dressed in black. They stared at us and only walked toward the tree behind them, “oh god no…” I saw it…her christy’s body hung blood flowing from many cuts as the figure lifted her veil, “you all will pay for what you done” it screamed as we ran back toward town.

We didn’t speak a word, my sin was hiding Christy's death from the town… the police were on a manhunt for months and after a year of looking no one found her. We never found out who the black dressed figure was but she haunts me, in my dreams Christy hangs blaming me for what i’ve done. So if you find this please let people know the truth and stay away from the chamber’s home.

I, like many other students in my area, moved to London after graduation. I went there to do what many others did before me. Work on a pub, party, and live small and cramped with other foreigners in a flat. The flat I was going home to a late evening in november last year.

I was offered to close the sportsbar I used to work in. I liked the peacefulness and I could collect my thoughts so I accepted it. The downside though was that it got pitchblack outside when it was time for me to take the train. The whole walk to the train station was completely empty. It was quite creepy.

So I stood alone on the platform when the train rolled in. It was almost empty. There was a man and a woman sitting next to eachother and I went and sat down on the opposite seats to the couple so I wouldnt feel as alone. It would take me nearly an hour to go home so I had a long ride ahead of me.

To avoid unpleasant people, I never looked at someone else. I always just look out the window, play games on my phone or fake sleeping.

After two stations, a young man got on the train. He entered through the doors behind me and walked past me to the seats on the other end with his head facing me. I avoided looking at him but I noticed that after a few minutes he switched seats to one that was closer to me. Maybe he sat on a bad seat and wanted to change, I wouldnt have known. The man changed seat again. After a few minutes passed he changed once again.

Despite not looking at him, I knew he was hardcore staring at me. He sat on a seat closer. One more. And one more. At last, he sat next to me. I was terrified. Literally shitting my pants. Stale as a stick. But I continued to look away from both him and the couple in front of me. I kept my gaze on the window. It was pitchblack outside so the only thing I saw was my own reflection. Its silly but I weirdly imagined that I wasnt visible if I didnt look at the man.

The train had been rolling for about 20 minutes, and then the man leaned over to me. His warm breath tickled my ear when he whispered.

''You need to get off at the next stop with me''

For the first time I turned and looked at the man. He was like over his 30's and looked worn. His eyes lacked of warmth and were erratic. I shaked my head. I had no plans to get off the train anytime soon, especially with a stranger.

He kept staring at me and repeated his words quietly in my ears.

''You need to get off at the next stop with me''

''No'' I said.

The man repeated his words once again. In the end, I couldnt take it anymore. I still dont understand why and it goes against everything Ive learned but when the train arrived on the next stop, I got off the train with the man. The cold hit me as we walked out.

''I did what you said! I got off the train! Why was that so important? What the fuck do you want?'' I shouted.

The man took a deep breath. His eyes changed shape to warmth or rather relief.

''Im sorry for my behavior but I did it for your safety''

''For my safety? What are you talking about?''

''Did you look closely to the couple that were sitting in front of you?''

''No, not really, why?''

''Then you didnt see that the woman was dead''

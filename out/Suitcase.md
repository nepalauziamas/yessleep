 

My son and I play games.

He likes to pretend to be someone else. He'll talk similarly to my wife, or imitate one of his cartoons.

Sometimes, he likes to hide in the cupboard and surprise us. Almost gave me a heart attack, that time.

I'm always very careful that he doesn't get in trouble. Don't want to find him locked inside his own room by accident.

One time, he almost fell off the second story window when he thought he could fly. He's only 3 years old.

I don't know if he'll see his fourth year, though.

It all starts during the morning. I'm packing things up. I need to go away on a trip.

My wife wants me to go. Things haven't been good. He doesn't want me to go. He cries a lot. Like I said, three years old.

I wish I could take him with me. Forget everything and just run. But this is a working trip.

I pack my suitcase, four wheels and a strong handle, and leave it in the living room. I need to leave by 10 PM. 

Right around six, the sun sets, and a shadow drapes the neighborhood. I come down to the kitchen to make myself dinner. It's best to avoid bothering my wife.

Then, I hear something coming from the living room. Small steps. From the corner of my eye I see him. My kid runs in the direction of the suitcase.

I take my time. I can see his blue eye poking from the inside of the suitcase. I figure it's not a big risk if I play along. I'm wrong.

"All right, I'm leaving fer the airport!" I say, zipping the suitcase. It's heavy.

I get in the car. I can hear him giggling. I put the suitcase in the back of the car. I start doing a couple rounds through the suburbs. I pretend to talk on the phone, say that I'm on my way to the airport by now. He giggles.

Ten minutes pass. I get a phone call from my wife. She probably got worried. I don't care.

Once again, I consider taking my kid. No one would miss us. Maybe get lost on some other tropical resort, build a new life. He won't miss her. More time passes.

Another call. I remember the fact that I still haven't put my ties inside the suitcase and that triggers it. Back to reality. Time to return home.

I make my way back to the house, not saying anything yet to my kid. I can't hear him giggling anymore, but I don't pay attention to that.

I pull in the driveway.

And I see my wife. Holding my kid in her arms.

Who's inside the suitcase?

An electric jolt courses through my body. I run as fast as I can. I yell at my family to get inside the house. We lock the doors and go to the master bedroom. I explain about what happened. My son interrupts.

"That's why I don't want you to leave."

I look at him.

"The monster that lives in the cupboard. What if you return and confuse him for me?"

 

A year ago, I was found in bed at my apartment raving about a loathsome land that swallowed me up, a place that could only exist in the mind of a madman, a place where land and animal are the same. For 10 years they said I was missing, but for me it felt like no more than a few months. I have not aged, yet my brother just a year older than me had changed greatly, his hair now almost fully grey. 

I have no memory of how I got there, I went to bed like any other night and fell asleep. At first, when I woke, I believed it was a dream, a horrible nightmare that I could not awake from, in a land that was alive. If you could call that revolting foul-smelling thing alive, it could just as easily be dead with its rotting pulsating flesh throbbing, as if ready to burst. Its skin peeled in parts revealing a dark tar-like substance that seemed to infect the surrounding area, causing some sort of fungus to quickly spread like a virus. Some of the larger older “scabs” I call them have an array of weird things growing from them, at the surface countless jelly like tentacles that resemble a meadow from a distance, a dead one, void of color.  

As I walked barefoot across it, I could feel its sticky arms burst, making a soggy sound as my feet sank deep into the hideous mess which left behind a pool of thick sludge in my wake, that I could barely pull my feet from. My reason for risking such a dangerous journey is simple, in the center was growing a long tree-like plant which rose so high that I could not see the top. But before I could reach the base, I had to cross a field of thorn like things, which looked as if they were dancing in the wind. But there was no wind, the only breeze I felt was from the odd pocket of gas that escaped randomly from the fresher wounds, the smell of which was like rotten flesh mixed with ammonia that burned my eyes and lungs. 

Trying to navigate through that horrific maze caused me unnatural pain brought on by endless wave after wave of attack from them foul creatures as they tore deep into my flesh, until I couldn’t take it anymore and fell to the ground. I have no way of knowing how long I was out, if it was hours, days or just minutes, but I woke with such an unsatiable apatite that even the repulsive vegetation tempted me. 

I found a grey orb-like growth at the edge of the thorny forest which did not have a putrid smell like most of the growing things there. When I bit into it its soft fleshy skin burst filling my mouth with a thick slime like substance that almost made me vomit. The smell was mildly unpleasant, but the taste was somewhat familiar, which I could never explain why. 

It took what I assume was days for me to get my strength back enough to make such a climb, but I have no way of knowing since the sky was always the same shade of bright glowing red. My only nourishment was coming from those awful orbs that made me so ill at first, that I spent most of my time curled up in a ball screaming in pain. But in time the pain eased, and I was able to stomach those gelatinous orbs with only the mildest discomfort. . 

My first attempt at scaling that monstrosity was cut short by an earthquake that shook the ground so much that I was lifted 20ft high, only saved by the angle of my fall sliding horizontally down the stem, slowed by the many branches before landing in a pile of sludge 5ft deep, which took hours to get free from. I was lucky to have escaped with such few injuries that it only took me days to recover. 

Again, I risked it all in hopes I would find a way out of my hell and climbed its fleshy veins that felt warm to the touch. In my trail I left a stream of green oozing liquid as I stuck my nails deep into it as I pulled myself higher and higher. As I climbed the skin on the tree started to become so thin, that it eventually became completely translucent, and I could see a flurry of white orbs flowing inside it, like blood pumping through veins. Every now and then I'd push my hand through its soft flesh and replenish my supplies, then watch it heal itself almost instantly. 

The true scale of what I was actually looking at hit me when I got high enough to see over what I thought was a large mountain range. For I could see the land open up, revealing what looked like an eye so big that even the largest city would seem miniscule inside of it. The large mountain range I was looking at was nothing more than a pimple on its skin. 

In that moment I believed I had died and gone to hell; how else could I explain such detestable horrors. As I stood there staring into its dark flickering pupil, I thought why me, I lived a good honest life, why would God send me to this place. I could feel the anger build up inside me and soon I succumbed to my rage and started punching the tree with such force that my hand got lodged deep inside. While trying to free it with my other hand I pushed with all my strength, but ended up getting both hands stuck. Soon I felt myself getting dragged inside. I did my best to fight it, but it was no use I got completely sucked in. 

As I climbed higher inside that tube, I finally saw past the red glowing sky which revealed endless worlds like the one I had just come from, all connected by stems like the one that brought me there. Struggling to take what I thought was my last breath. I could not help but think of the life I left behind and how insignificant my problems were before I was brought to that place, where no mortal should ever even dream of going and how different I would do things if I could go back to that place now. 

Then with a bright flash of light I was back in my bed, but it was not my bed anymore, for beside me was a woman that I did not know, in a room that did not seem in the least bit familiar to me, with its pink curtains and frilly bedsheets. Before she went running out of there, she screamed so loud I could feel my ears pop. Not long after a large man came charging in and pinned me to the ground, the cops soon followed. 

When they asked me where I had been for so long, and how I ended up in that poor girl's room, I had no answer to give. So, I was silent, and stayed silent to this day, for fear I might speak out loud the unspeakable horrors I had seen in that awful place and infect the minds of others. Now I spend my time sitting in my room alone, my only company is the memory of that monstruous thing, as it haunts every waking moment of my life. Even in my sleep I can’t escape my terror, for in my dreams I find myself back in that dreadful place. 

I only speak now because I am dying, infected by that cursed place, black tar seeping from the scars it gave me, infecting everything it touches. I thought I escaped that curse place, but I was wrong, it came back with me, and it is not alone, I can hear them calling out to me like a siren, warning of impending doom.

So I live in a pretty old house, it used to be a barn, my room is the only one that still has some of the original walls. Because I have a big family (six children, three adults and two dogs) we all share a room with someone. My room is the only bedroom on the first floor, everyone else's bedrooms are on the second floor. I share a room with my little sister and my two dogs. 

So one night my little sister and I are just sitting on my bed watching some YouTube videos, we were up pretty late it was around two in the morning. As we watched the videos she heard three clear but faint knocks on the wall behind us.

 The odd thing is that behind that wall is the stairwell that leads upstairs, we brushed it off as maybe someone coming down to get water. So a few minutes later we forgot about the knocking and we're just laughing and talking about the video. But then we both heard it *knock* *knock* *knock* but this time it was louder than before. And the dogs didn't react to it at all, which is unusual because at night they are very cautious about any noise and bark at anything unfamiliar. But they seemed unbothered by the noise, they continued to sleep peacefully.

 I didn't want to just ignore the noise, especially because my little sister seemed frightened. So being the older sister, I decided to leave my room and search the house to see what could be making the noise, but after searching for a while I found nothing and everyone else was asleep upstairs. 

So I returned to my room and jokingly told my little sister that it was a mouse, it made her feel a little more at ease but we were still scared. About an hour later my little sister decided to go to sleep on her bed, and she soon fell asleep. 

Now it was silent in the house apart from the light snoring of my sister and the dogs, so I decided to try sleeping too. But for some reason I felt that if I went to sleep something bad would happen, I wasn't usually this paranoid about things like this so I decided to sleep anyway.

 Shortly after falling asleep I started to have a dream, in the dream I was laying in my bed when someone knocked on my window, I ignored it but then my window was shattered and a tall black shadow crept into my room. My dogs started barking and growling at the figure but it continued to drag it's heavy body into my room, my small dog charged at the figure causing it to fall to the floor, then my big dog charged at the figure. I couldn't really see what was happening because I wasn't able to move from my bed, but it was eerily quiet. 

After a short moment my dogs ran whimpering and sprinted under my bed, I began panicking as I saw the creature crawling behind my sisters bed. It slowly reached for her hand and I yelled out "leave her!!" , I instantly regretted my decision when the figure looked up and locked eyes with me. I was too scared to breath, suddenly the shadow appeared in front of my bed and let out a horrible scream, the sound was so terrifying that it felt like my heart stopped for a second. 

I was so frightened that I woke up crying and struggling to breathe, I looked around my room searching for my dogs but I couldn't find them. I knew they were under my bed, but why? It was just a silly dream right? Suddenly the home security alarm went off, I didn't want to go disarm it. I was too scared but I had to, so I opened my door and quickly walked to the security system and disarmed it. I was too afraid to look around, the shadow from my dream burned in my mind. I looked up and that's when I saw him, standing in my room smiling at me. 

He slammed my room door shut and I couldn't get in, I wanted to save my sister but ger screams told me that I was too late. All the noise had alerted my mom and she slowly walked downstairs asking what happened, I couldn't explain so I just opened my room door, and she saw my little sister covered in cuts and blood. My sister was rushed to the hospital but didn't survive and every night I see him standing in my room waiting. Waiting for the day when it's my turn to hear the knocking, my turn to be trapped with it, my turn to fight the shadow man.

Operation False Nosedive 

The year is not important, the information in this web post is. I would be, relative to you. A man from the future posting on a forum. I am part of the very few that are not still walkers. You don't know what that is and I doubt it has happened. I am sending this message as far back as I can without destroying what's left.

The ending of humanity has transpired. Like I said, I am part of the few. Soon there will be no more sentient humans on the planet. I post this as a warning but I cannot relay events precisely as they happened. Many variables could end up delaying or changing what is an already grim fate to that of a hellscape. Instead I will describe what happened as vaguely as possible. These vague hints will start to appear as “red flags'' for those who read this. Remember what I am about to say. Your life may depend on it. 

Operation False Nosedive was a series of experiments on the populace of the United states of America. Like the name suggests, this involved convincing the general populace that they themselves were a part of a so-called “nosedive”. This would convince any American that their country was in danger. These were all false positives and these tests were only ever to prove that reliance on the government would be at an all time high. While this was obvious to anyone who would even approach this idea. The real experiment would be how far they can convince the average American to go against their norm. Questions like, can we take their guns away? Can we tell them that water is bad? What if we tell them breathing too much air is life threatening? Of course these are extreme examples but the message was the same. Could we convince you that we are helping you when in reality, you are hurting yourself.  

A full year of lockdown was done. Nevermind the year. This regulated people into their homes and convinced them that a terrible virus was on the loose. In reality new viruses are always discovered and never really pose a threat. The CDC had many extinction level viruses under quarantine that could effectively wipe out the world in less than two months. These viruses were tested and scientists had developed vaccines and other medicine that would greatly benefit humankind. Why is this relevant? Because the government had told the CDC  to release a level 4 virus into the general populace. For reference, level 5 is almost harmless and level 0 is a doomsday level threat. The virus is barely classified as a level 4, it has a low fatality rate but it is very contagious. This was done and the world had stopped for a year. People had been confined into their homes and were told to keep distance from one another. A level 4 virus doesn't elicit this type of response but when the government is telling you that it will spread and kill everyone you love if YOU are not careful, then there is only so much you think. This is what convinced the government that it could strip away rights and essentially command the entire populace if the “False Nosedive” was dire enough.

The false level 3 leak. 

A few years after this event, a level 3 would be leaked to the public and would yield a higher fatality rate. As the name suggests, this was falsely labeled a level 3. The fatality rate was 0. Any people infected with the virus simply walked through their everyday lives. It was three days later with no signs of infection. Late into the night, a scientist was called into their monitor room. One of the infected had been staring blankly into a wall and had not moved For several hours. As the call was given to extract him, he had moved towards a store. When the team had arrived, the man had broken into the store and started eating anything he could get his hands on. When the team attempted to remove the man, he sprung on them. He had injured several officers and just continued to feed. It wasn't until he was satisfied that we were able to extract him. His behavior was just standing still and staring directly forward until he was hungry. Food and water were provided and again once he was full, he continued to stare into the wall. Other infected started to show similar symptoms. Escort teams were sent out with utmost urgency. Every single infected was brought back and kept under surveillance. One of the guards of the escort team was infected, this was first noticed by a scientist when he had asked the guard a question but he was unresponsive. His eyes seemed to widen when the scientist stared at him. He had stared back but was unresponsive to his questions. After a while, the scientist noticed his eyes dart back to the wall. The guard was taken in for testing and the scientist was put into a quarantine lab. Breathing samples were collected and shown no traces of the virus. Spit and skin samples were non conclusive. 

The first spark of realization hit the scientist in quarantine. One morning, the examiners who were watching through the window said that the scientist had just stayed up throughout the night and stared at a wall. When morning came, the examiners had told this to the scientist. He had strongly protested that he was asleep. In this lab the scientist had noticed his eyes widened when looking at a mirror. It had widened fast and returned to normal just as quickly. He had a hunch and taped a piece of sample paper onto the mirror. He had stared at the mirror and when his eyes widened, he stared directly at this paper. Using the equipment in his lab, he had determined that the virus was somehow piggybacking on the light rays reflected off our eyes. This was impossible to him and by any means of rational science. However when he relayed this to the examiners. The same tests were done to the others and had the same results. Anyone with direct eyesight with the infected were quarantined. The virus had spread through the examiners and an emergency code was sent to the white house. The virus seemed to have been contained. This was at least everyone's hope. It wasn't until a tv in the lab had relayed a story about a man in Times square staring blankly into the street. This was on a news channel. The virus could not go through screens but thousands of people walk through times square. New york city was immediately put under strict quarantine, surveillance of nearby cameras had confirmed the worse. The man was standing there for at least two days. Many tourists had left the city by then and had directly contracted the virus. Examiners had screens put into chambers and examined our behavior. I had shown the most promise. I would black out and stare at a wall but would come to my senses sooner or later. Another examiner had told me through the intercom what was happening on the outside. First the experiments.

When an infected individual is in a contained environment and cannot find a source of food. They will return to stare and chew chunks of flesh they had ripped out of their hands using their teeth. When two infected were put into the same room with no food. They had resorted to eating eachother. When one was dead, the other had started biting off parts of his lips and tongue.

These test results had shown that the humans infected will prolong their life just to spread said infection. Then there came the outside news.

Most of the country is infected. A few propaganda posters were shown to me about countermeasures. “Beware of widened eyes” and “ The mirror test “ were thrown around these posters. The examiner had told me that those that are infected had flooded all common food stores and gas stations. But we were close with a sort of vaccine. An eye drop that would stop the transmission of the virus. However these were only temporary. The examiner days into our research had said that cannibalism had run rampant through the country. This was depressing to hear but my research had almost come into fruition. My equipment was limited but through the examiner, I could tell him to use equipment and how. My research had finally paid off and with his help. The first “cures” were made. The data was to be sent on all emergency channels. All he had to do was type all my data into the message board. This was when I blacked out. I had come too staring at the wall. But when I turned around…. He was there staring into me from beyond the window. When his eyes had widened, fear struck me. He was gone, taken. And he was the only one outside of this locked room that could transmit the data. 

After that, blackout after blackout. Time had passed. More and more of them are staring into my room. I could only access the software that was on local hard drives. This software had been allowed to post on a “ghost forum” in the past. I don't know how. But this is what you are currently reading.  There are detailed reports and I'll send those in a different response. This whole thing may seem rushed but blacking out is happening more frequently. I had to do as much as I could while I was alive. I could barely call that state living. But every time I come too. More of them appear outside my window. And there are cracks starting to form. I guess I'm their final meal. The term still walkers was coined by my examiner buddy. He's still there. There's also an elephant in the room. How am I alive with no food? Well turns out, during my blackout stage. I had eaten a part of my left arm and chewed through my left cheek. I don't look human and the corpses lining up the window look more human than me. This place is a feeding ground now.

I blacked out directly after this and ate the examiner as he broke through the window. I'm going to check for myself how bad it is outside. As far as I can before I succumb. Am I lucky for having a sort of resistance to this. I can't even use the equipment. I'm writing this last sentence with a pencil in my mouth jamming at keys. For me, right now it's over,  beware of widened eyes.

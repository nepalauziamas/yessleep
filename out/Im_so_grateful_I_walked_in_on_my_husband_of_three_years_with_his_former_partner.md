It’s funny, you never think you’ll wind up married to a clown. Yet there I was at the age of thirty, catering for some brat’s 8th birthday party, when the mother stood at the far edge of the fancy garden and introduced ‘Mr. Giggles’ to a chorus of cheers.

From behind the lunch counter, I watched as my future husband made doves disappear with a flourish of his hands and juggled behind his back. Around him, the children sat in a little semi-circle roaring with laughter.

After the performance, Mr. Giggles wandered over to me, introduced himself as Johnny, and asked for a cheeseburger.

“That was quite a show,” I said, slipping a beef patty into a bun. I remember thinking he looked kinda cute—you know, beneath the face paint and rainbow wig.

“Thanks,” he said, still breathless from the pratfalls. “I’ve been workshopping some new material. I used to have this bit with an angry hand puppet, but kids these days hate hand puppets. Go figure.”

Johnny, unlike his character, came across all shy and soft-spoken. Every so often, kids hopped up on fizzy drinks and chocolate cake stormed over and asked for an encore, and each time Mr. Giggles sprung to life, pulling coins out of ears or squirting water from the flower on his lapel. That infectious enthusiasm is what warmed my heart, I think.

Fast forward six years and the entire groom party (all professional clowns) pulled up to our wedding in a single Mini Cooper.

Now here’s a recipe for one strained marriage: take two independent contractors, mix in a lockdown, season with some overdue mortgage payments, et viola!

Johnny crammed all his equipment inside this spare room at the back of the house, and one afternoon, while passing the outside hallway, I heard a hushed conversation from behind the door.

Rather than become one of *those* couples who needed to constantly keep tabs on their spouse, I forced myself to walk on by.

But these ‘encounters’ happened again and again, and I couldn’t bite down on my suspicions forever.

I finally succumbed to temptation and knocked on the door one afternoon. After some nervous shuffling about a case slammed closed, then Johnny pulled open the door and smiled; a short, nervous smile that showed too many teeth to be genuine.

“Who were you talking to?” I asked, stealing a glance past his shoulder. Rudimentary furniture and gag props lay scattered about here and there.

He cracked the fingers on his right hand and flexed the wrist, as though shaking out an ache. “Just an old colleague.”

This sent up a red flag. Or perhaps, a series of little ones, all tied together and crammed up his sleeve. Years earlier, he’d casually mentioned a lady he performed with as a duo…

“Oh, which one?”

“Dan,” he said. “You never met him, he moved to Australia years ago.”

His vague, non-committal answers left an unpleasant gnawing sensation in the pit of my stomach. Still, I trusted him.

A few months later, I got hired as head chef at Blue Chicago, one of my city’s most popular restaurants. Suddenly, Ruth and Johnny weren’t on a shoestring budget anymore. Suddenly, I had money to burn.

In his sleep, Johnny started writhing around relentlessly. It seemed like every time I drifted off rogue digits jabbed me in the throat. I considered asking him to consult a therapist about his money anxieties.

Then, while I chopped tomatoes in the kitchen one evening, he wandered in and said, “Is that a new knife?”

I stopped mid-chop, held the blade up to the light, and smiled. “Yep. It’s a Zwiling. I got the whole set.” I pointed at a wooden display stand on the counter. “I thought I’d treat myself since the Christmas bonus finally came through.”

The fancy collection had everything: a knife specifically for garnishing, another for utility cutting, and a meat cleaver that could slice straight through bone.

“How much did it cost?” Johnny asked, his tone accusatory.

“Don’t worry, we can afford it,” I replied, then continued chopping. His constant questioning of every purchase had grown tiresome.

“Ruth, you *know* children’s entertainment is in a slump. I haven’t had a booking for weeks, my finances are stretched thin.”

“Maybe if you took that Amazon delivery job,” I mumbled.

“Oh, you want me to quit clowning? Is that it?” His cracked the knuckles on his right hand.

“Nobody said you have to quit. Maybe just get a real job for a little while to–”

“Real?” he asked, offended.

I’d taken a cheap shot at his life-long passion, one I didn’t really mean. Believe me when I say I loved being married to a clown—the way kids' faces lit up around Mr. Giggles warmed my heart—but at that moment, Johnny pulled my strings in a bad way. An argument had been brewing for a while.

As he stormed out of the room, I followed him into the hallway. “Oh, are you off to tell *her* what I said?”

“Who?”

"Do you think I'm some kind of dummy? You’re ex-girlfriend, that’s who. What was her name, Brandi? Bonnie?”

He crossed the threshold of his inner sanctum, faced me, and stabbed the air with his finger. “You’re crazy.”

“Oh please, then who are you talking to all the time? Why all the smoke and daggers?”

He sighed. “There’s parts of my life you’ll never understand, Ruth. The clown worlds…*complicated*.”

Not rolling my eyes took a hero's effort. “If you and your mystery woman enjoy each other’s company so much, why not run off and join the circus?”

Visibly hurt by this remark, he slammed the door in my face.

For the next few days, Johnny practically lived out of that spare room, and between his self-isolation and my long shifts, we spent very little time together. I apologized for the circus remark, he apologized for his reaction to the knife, but things were still frosty whenever we passed each other on the landing, or coming out of the bathroom.

Meanwhile, every now and again, strange sounds rang out from Johnny’s quarters. Scuffles. Furniture scraping roughly across the wooden floor. Muffled voices. Grunts, groans. But anytime I snuck along and pushed my ear against the door, the room lowered its voice.

For all I knew there was a corpse stashed beyond that door. Maybe ‘Bonnie’ had moved in right under my nose…

One Saturday, Johnny got a last-minute call to fill in at a company picnic and scrambled to assemble his gear before flying straight out the door.

After almost stepping on his phone on my way out of the bedroom, I rushed after him.

On the front landing, I hesitated. Despite my better judgement, I entered the passcode—our anniversary—and found zero suspicious messages or nude photos, just tedious ‘shop talk’ with his colleagues.

A few seconds later, a key jingled in the front door. I pretended I’d still been in the process of rushing after Johnny and handed over the phone.

Once he left, I poured myself a glass of wine and flicked through some old photo albums. Toward the back of one, I came across a shot of Johnny at his first-ever show, performing with this raggedy Anne-style hand puppet bonking him on the side of the head with a club. The audience—a group of children not much younger than him—were giggling away.

Just then, I hated myself for not trusting my husband. Was his behaviour suspicious? Most definitely. But I’d jumped to conclusions. Invaded his privacy. And worst of all, insulted his passion.

A romantic gesture seemed like the perfect way to patch things up.

With food being *my* great passion, it’ll come as no surprise I decided a romantic dinner would spice things up. But I wanted a grand gesture to go with the meal. A secret ingredient if you will.

The idea came to me at work that night while preparing a lamb curry. Would it be a little cheesy? Definitely. And oh sure, I’d never take centre stage at the Royal Variety Performance. But with a few practice sessions, Johnny would sure get a kick out of it.

It’s amazing the things you can learn from Youtube these days. I darted around the city picking up materials then, over the course of the next few days, worked on my little project in secret. Anytime Johnny emerged from his layer, I’d stash my work-in-progress behind a sofa cushion or under the desk.

On the big night, he arrived home late from a gig at a children’s hospital. My gift lay on the kitchen counter, wrapped up in a giftbox.

In the dining room, I dimmed the lights and lit some candles.

“What’s all this?” Johnny asked, as he stepped through the door.

“I thought we could have a romantic meal. I made honey roasted tenderloin, your favourite.”

“Okay,” he said, his voice all flat. “Let me go change.”

Not quite the enthusiastic response I’d hoped for…

He disappeared into that room, again, while I watched the candles burn themselves out. How long did stripping off a costume take? The tenderloin would be cold at this rate.

Stepping into the hallway, I heard the voices. *Again*. Except this time, it sounded like there was a row going on. Suspicious, I tiptoed along—not that there was much danger of being heard—and held my ear against the door.

“No, it’s just a crummy dinner…this means nothing…of course I care about you.”

What. A. Bastard. He *was* talking to an ex. And after all the trouble I’d gone to preparing that tenderloin…

Eager to catch him red-handed, I burst through the door, and when I saw what was going on in there, I froze.

He was still in costume, but he wasn’t speaking on the phone. My intuition had been way off.

Instead, he was arguing with this little hand puppet; one with red curls, a French beret, rosy cheeks, and a button-down coat.

Johnny shot up off his chair at the sight of me, the room suddenly crackling with tension.

“Johnny?” I asked, confused. Light reflected off the puppet’s button eyes. I looked from it to him and said, “What’s going on?”

“Ruth, I…I…” he stammered away for almost ten seconds before swallowing a gulp and relaxing the muscles in his jaw. Then, without moving his mouth, he said, “We’ve been talking, me and Mr. Giggles.”

Wait. Why did his voice climb several octaves higher?

On the end of his arm, the puppet slowly rotated toward me. “And we don’t care for the way you’ve been talking about clowns. No siree, we don’t care for it at all.”

The stammer and anxiety had vanished. Johnny now spoke in that stern tone teachers used when lecturing a student.

This couldn’t be happening; he couldn’t be so trapped in delusion he communicated via puppet. “Johnny…have you been in here talking to a fucking doll this whole time?”

The notion drew a laugh from me. In a way, I think an affair might have been easier to swallow. “You need help,” I said, pinching the bridge of my nose.

“Help?” he replied, his mouth a permanent straight line. “As if we need help from *you*. You only wanted Johnny, not Mr. Giggles. Her royal highness couldn’t stand being married to a clown, could she? She didn’t want a man who brought joy into children’s lives, she just wanted an expensive kitchen for cooking fancy French cuisines. Well, me and Mr. Giggles hate French food. Don’t we Mr. Giggles?”

The puppet swivelled toward Johnny, who nodded, submissively. “That’s right Bonbon.”

When the puppet faced me again, he mouthed, ‘I’m sorry’.

Bonbon? My husband’s brain had become completely scrambled. He didn’t need help—he needed a serious psychiatric evaluation. I now tasted a whole, rancid danger in the air.

“Johnny…” I started.

“He’s not Johnny,” Bonbon shrieked. “He’s Mr. Giggles. And it’s about time you learned that.”

The clown and the puppet both lunged at me.

Terrified, I spun into the hall and made a desperate break for the front door, Bonbon cackling away, then on the far side of the landing my husband’s hands locked around my waist and hurled me into the wall, a glass cabinet, and finally over a side table, which made me crash onto the floor, hard.

Sprawled across the carpet, I managed a feeble, “Please, let me go.”

“Oh, you’re not going anywhere,” Bonbon said, rubbing her hands—operated by Johnny’s pinky finger and thumb—together as she crept her into my blurred window of vision. “The way we see it, you’ve been a real brat to poor Mr. Giggles.” She faced her puppeteer, who sobbed and kept his eyes fixed on the floor. “And you know what we do with brats, don’t you Mr. Giggles?”

Without looking up he shook his head, then Bonbon leaned close to his right ear and whispered something.

A horrified look spread across Johnny’s face. “Oh Bonbon, we can’t do that,” he said, feebly. “Who’d mop up the blood?”

Still gasping, I crawled along the hall and into the kitchen, away from the psychotic jester. Bolts of pain raced through my ribs every time my arm lifted above my head. The scuffle had left me broken and bleeding in a dozen places.

“It’s nothing personal, little Ruthy,” said the puppet, stalking me through the door. “But see, you and Mr. Giggles were never gonna work out. He needs a partner who appreciates him.”

My hands fumbled across the ceramic tiles for a pot or a pan—anything to defend myself with.

I came at last to the counter. Wait. My fancy knife lay perched on top.

Ignoring the needles drilling into my midsection, I clawed my way up the side and unintentionally swiped the gift box onto the floor.

Johnny grabbed my shoulder, used it to steer me around, and leaned his companion in close, her face inches away from mine. Past her, I saw tears stream down Johnny’s cheeks as he avoided my gaze.

So much for fighting back. Now I could only pray some portion of the man I married was still rolling around in there.

“Johnny, I love you,” I whimpered.

Muscles in his neck flexed. While he squeezed his eyes shut, Bonbon whipped between us, then slapped him across the face. “What are you doing?” Her voice sounded different now. Nervous. “Kill her already!”

“Please don’t,” I rasped. “Johnny, I love you so, so much. Remember the first time we met? You just wanted to eat your burger and flirt with me, but kids kept running up and asking for more tricks. I thought it was adorable the way you made them all feel special.”

His lower lip wobbled. As he backed away, I slid down the counter and onto the floor, beside the gift box.

Above me, Bonbon tried to strike him, but he grabbed his own forearm and held her in place. “No,” he said, straining from the effort of resisting the puppet's influence. “I won’t let you do this.”

Out of nowhere, Johnny’s body relaxed. For a moment I thought he’d broke the spell—that we’d survived this horrible nightmare.

“Well then,” the puppet said seriously, “if you’re too much of a chicken, I’ll just have to do it myself.”

Reluctantly, Johnny’s free hand let go of his arm and reached around the back of his own skull. From his bemused expression, you could tell he wasn’t running the show anymore.

I watched, horrified, as he bashed his face against the counter and then the wall, producing a sickening thud. The macabre performance left me in a state of shock, otherwise I might have dragged myself to my feet and snatched a knife.

A slab of tenderised beef loomed over me, grinning. Flakes of peeled face paint and juicy blood streaked Johnnys head white and red, like vanilla ice cream doused in strawberry sauce. The rubber nose had fallen off and several teeth were dislodged, broken, or missing.

The creature said, “Johnny’s mine, you hear?” in a burly voice, half his own, half Bonbon’s.

The puppet swayed back and forth as Johnny shuffled toward me. Those knives lay up on the counter, outside reach. But the giftbox had landed beside my feet. Both Johnny’s sanity and my life were on the line; I had no choice other than to fight fire with fire. And quickly.

Black circles danced before my ever-shrinking window of vision as I grabbed the box, tore open the wrapper, fumbled around for the hidden slot inside the packaging paper, and let my hand slide into place.

Then, I held my arm between Johnny and me, a shield. Here goes nothing…

A crudely made lamb puppet sat on the end of my arm, one with a pink bow and big, bright eyes.

“Say hello to Lambchop,” I rasped. Johnny hesitated, that gap-toothed smile vanishing.

In my best ‘cute’ voice, I said: “That’s right, I’m Lambchop, and I came here to tell you Ruth loves you. Both of you, Johnny *and* Mr. Giggles.”

“What are you doing you big lummox? *I’m* in control here.” Bonbon screamed.

“Don’t listen to her. She’s only a part of you, just like I’m only a part of Ruth. And every part of Ruth loves every part of you.”

“Kill her,” screamed Bonbon, furiously shaking back and forth. “Kill her, kill her, kill her!”

His gaze whipped between me and the puppet. Then, with a decisive shake of his head, he said: “No.”

When Bonbon next lunged, Johnny held his own forearm, pinned her flat against the counter by pressing his knee beneath the crook of his elbow, and then grabbed the butcher knife from the stand. Unable to wriggle free, the psychotic puppet squealed and squirmed around, helpless.

The blade came down in a fierce, shining arc. By the time I’d hauled myself up, Johnny had already drawn it out of his forearm and plunged it in a second time, then a third, a fourth.

Exposed cartilage and ripe muscle trailed beneath the elbow, spurting blood thicker than peppercorn sauce over the counter, sink, and part of the wall.

Johnny stumbled across the room, finally hitting the floor in a dramatic manner, reminiscent of those pratt falls he did so well.

On the counter, his hand—and subsequently, Bonbon—twitched wildly.

Already on the phone with the paramedics, I tied a belt tight around Johnny’s stump.

“Ruth,” he sputtered, as he lay flat in a pool of his own blood.

“I’m here. Stay with me.”

He looked up at me, eyes glazed, and said, “Things really got out of hand there, huh?”

And through the tears, despite all the fresh trauma, I let out a little chuckle.

My husband. [Ever the entertainer…](https://www.reddit.com/r/thoughtindustry/comments/te0fum/welcome_i_hope_you_enjoy_your_stay/)

This week, I was supposed to digitize all of Dr. Marnen's patient files.

I was feeling good about my progress when I saw it. A second filing cabinet, hiding behind the shelves, that I’d never noticed before.

Sighing with fatigue, I yanked open the first drawer. I plucked out a file from the ‘A’ section and began to read.

*ABERDEEN, CARLA*

“Alright, Carla, let’s see if you’re in the system.” I set the file on the desk, sat down at the computer, and typed in her name.

Nothing came up.

*Oh, hell no. I am not doing ALL the files in this cabinet.* But I sighed, opened a new patient file, and began copying the data. *Carla Aberdeen… DOB 4/24/72… 5’ 9”, 176 lbs…*

Finally, I got to the doctor’s notes. They were written in messy script, as if in a hurry. I put on my glasses, and read:

*- Complaints of eczema*

*- Itchiness after eating some fruits*

*- Lungs may be useful*

I stopped and re-read the last line.

*Lungs may be useful*

I shrugged, figuring it was some sort of mistake or reference to something. I typed it into the computer and took the next file from the cabinet – a Mr. David Akowski.

But the doctor’s notes were even stranger, this time.

*- Family history of heart attacks*

*- Large skin surface area*

I typed him into the system and stared at the screen. *Large skin surface area? What does that even mean?*

When I got to the next one—a Miss Katerina Alanson—I felt the knot in my stomach tighten.

*History of work stress & anxiety*

*Recent panic attack*

*Feet are perfect size*

I rolled away from the computer. Heart pounding, I picked up the file and studied it. *There must be an explanation.*

But I couldn’t think of any.

I took a deep breath. Then I picked up the phone and dialed the number on Katerina’s file. *But what will I say?* I didn’t even know. I just had a terrible, nagging feeling, and wanted to do something about it.

But I wasn’t in luck.

*Boop-boop-boop!*

*We're sorry. You have reached a number that has been disconnected –*

“What are you doing?”

I whipped around.

Dr. Marnen was standing in the doorway, his arms crossed over his white coat. “I was digitizing the files. Like you told me to,” I stuttered, slamming the phone down.

“Not *those* files.” He violently grabbed the files from the desk, shoved them back into the file cabinet. Then he pulled a small key from his pocket and turned the locks on each drawer. *Click, click, click.*

“Finish this up, okay?”

I nodded. 

And then he was gone.

The silence pressed in. The waiting room was empty and still. I checked the clock – 4:45. No more patients would be coming in.

It was only Dr. Marnen and me in the office now.

So I did what any reasonable person would do. I shut down the computer, grabbed my coat, and started for the door. As I hurried towards the exit, I saw Dr. Marnen at the end of the hall.

He was opening a door – the door he told me went to the supply closet.

But beyond him, I could see a set of stairs, snaking down into the [darkness.](http://www.blair-daniels.com)

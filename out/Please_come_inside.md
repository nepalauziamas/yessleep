My exciting two-week summer road trip fizzled out after two days. My boyfriend and I had fought non-stop, and we figured it’d be better for both of us, and our relationship, to turn around, come back home to our respective apartments, and cool off. Separately. It was a bit awkward on the way back, but I’m sure we’ll figure it out after we’ve had some time apart. I had already texted him five minutes after he dropped me off -- I know, probably not the best idea but I couldn't help it!

When I got to my apartment, the parking lot was full, but it the whole place was incredibly quiet. The playground was empty, no one was at the picnic tables or walking on the sidewalk, it was sort of eerie.

I noticed our neighbor, Mrs. Shaerberg had boxes piled up on her peppy welcome mat (it had neon flowers on it and said ‘Welcome friends, come on in!’), her door was slightly ajar. I had my hands full with my suitcases but made a mental note to check on her later and see if she needed help with carrying those inside. She was a super nice lady and had a granddaughter that was my age. She was a bit forgetful, so Thea and I tried to check in on her every so often.

When I went inside Thea was out drawing on the balcony. She would often sit out there and draw or paint, sometimes the rocky shore and beach houses we could see from our window, other times the people walking by. You could see her sitting out there if you walked along the beach, so most of the year-round residents in town knew her by sight, if not by name.

She was a good roommate, quiet, kept to herself. Her major was just similar enough to mine that we had some classes in common we would sometimes study for together last semester.

I figured I’d let her know I was home early so I didn’t scare the crap out of her when she came in, but when I went to open the door, I noticed something – the door to the balcony was locked from the inside. My first thought was, it was a good thing I had come home early, my second thought was, ‘oh shit had I accidentally locked her out there when I left?’ Had she been outside this whole time?

She didn’t react like someone who had been stuck outside for days when the door opened, so I figured she’d somehow locked herself out recently and probably hadn’t noticed yet – I was honestly so relieved I hadn’t locked her outside because that’s the kind of thing I could see myself doing. She didn’t acknowledge me or respond when I told her I was home, she just kept her back to me, Kept drawing. That’s not too unusual because sometimes just she’s in her own world.

I texted my boss to see if I could pick up a shift since I was home and unpacked and then watched some TV in the living room while continuously checking to see if my boyfriend had texted me back (he hadn't). After a few hours, I decided to cook to distract myself from fixating on the trip and lack of response. 

“Hey! Are you coming in soon?”, I stepped outside, “I made you tofu parm”

She had her head down, still absorbed in her work. I shrugged to myself, set her food on the stove.

When it got dark out, though, and she was still out there, I stuck my head out and asked her if she was coming in, no response. I was surprised she hadn’t needed to come in for water or a bathroom break the entire time since I had been home, but it wasn’t strange enough to worry me at the time. 

When I got up this morning, I at first thought that she had woken up early to get back to it, but when I looked more closely, I noticed her clothes were the same as the ones she had on yesterday, and her hair looked damp. It had poured last night into this morning – had she sat out there all night, in the rain...? That was when I really started to worry about her. I didn’t have contact info for her family, or any other friends to reach out to them. 

I had heard back from work that there was a shift available in the late morning, so I went outside to let her know I was going to work (also as an excuse to check on her).

I hadn’t caught it yesterday, but when I approached her this morning, I realized she wasn’t actually drawing at all. She wasn't doing anything... She didn’t have her pencils, or even paper. She was just making some sort of motion like she was holding a pencil and sketching something, while staring down at the table.

Unsure of what else to do, I grabbed my purse and my keys and went back outside to bring her a glass of water.

I put it down next to her, but she was still immersed in...whatever it was that she was doing. I put my hand on her shoulder but immediately drew it back in surprise – her t-shirt felt weird, like clammy, sticky, skin against my hand. Now that I was closer to her, I noticed she smelled like damp soil -- earthy. 

For reasons I couldn’t explain at the time I felt incredibly alone and I instinctually found myself backing away from her into the apartment.

“Thea”, I whispered from the doorway, “Will you please come inside, now?”

She turned to look at me for the first time since I had been home. She looked… off. I can’t really describe it. It’s like the proportions of her face were wrong? She looked like herself, but at the same time, she didn’t?  I couldn’t put my finger on it – the longer I looked at her face, the more unsettled I felt. At the time, I had assumed it was likely due to her being sunburned, rained on, and dehydrated. She smiled at me though, wide and toothy. She had her lips pulled back too, so it was a bit unnerving, but it was a smile, so I figured that was a good start.

To my relief, she slowly rose and started to head inside. I wasn’t sure if it was due to how long she had been sitting hunched over, but her torso leaned slightly to one side like her upper body was too heavy for her spine to support.

I was so late and in such a hurry that I was at the front door by the time she walked over the threshold. I was glad to see her coming inside finally, though.

“See ya!” I shouted, as I left and locked the front door behind me.

I noticed Mrs. Shaerberg’s door was still open, the boxes were still there. I had totally forgotten to check on her, but I promised myself I’d check on her tonight. Now that I was looking more closely, I noticed that several other apartments were the same, dark inside, door slightly ajar. 

When I got to work, I started to wonder if I made the wrong decision. I worried that I shouldn’t have left Thea alone in her current state. I couldn’t get her out of my mind – her weird gait, the look on her face as I left, something was bothering me, and I also felt incredibly guilty. She probably shouldn’t be home alone.

I texted her to see how she was doing, but after a while when she hadn’t replied, I had to put my phone in my locker and go to work.

Still no response when I had a break for lunch.

I had just pulled into our apartment's parking lot few minutes ago when I got a text from her.

“Hey! I’m doing good. It's nice to see everyone and the weather is so nice here right now! I should be home next week, btw.”

I was so caught up in my own drama that I had forgotten that Thea had left the day after I did, to visit her family…

What’s in my apartment, then?

What do I do?

The fear of the dark is one many people have struggled with during there youth however many grow up to lose the fear understanding that there is no reason to fear the dark ruling it down to fear of the unknown. Then they go about there lives not realizing the true horror in the shadows. These things hide in the shadows out of sight staying where no people usually travel they are usually peaceful however when you reveal them by bumping into them they will attack you in an attempt to keep there hidden. My name is Arlo this is my story

My story starts at my house it was 2:00 A.M and I was sitting in my living room watching tv suddenly the power turned off I assumed the breaker flipped so I went down to the basement to flip it back my normal route to the flipper is straight there but I was moving some boxes around and had to go around I was slowly inching my way to it in the pitch black and suddenly I bumped into something I tried to feel it and I was freaked out it felt fleshy and hot I backed up in quite a panic as I was looking out to into the dark I saw a set of dark blue eyes peer straight at me as I ran up the stairs shutting the door to the basement I bolted towards the living room I thought that the best course of action was to call the cops so I got to the living room grabbing my phone I dialed 911 listening to the ringtone for a bit before they finally picked up "911 what's your emergency?" I hid in my kitchen pantry and in a hushed whisper said. "There's an intruder in my house I live at \*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\* avenue please hurry."   
The woman on the other side probably realized that I wasn't pranking them as she got serious quick. 

"Ok sir you need to remain calm are you hiding right now?" I was so I replied. "Yes I am hidden I do not think he knows I am here please hurry." before the woman could react I heard a set of footsteps  so in a stupid play I hung up on the call clutching my phone tight as the thing slowly walked around as I saw through the slit in the pantry the blue eyes looking straight at me my heart was racing as the thing slowly made its way towards me as it flung open the pantry I panicked turning on my phones flashlight and pointing it at the creature as it backed away in horror I used this to lead it to the basement and locked it in there. 

I was sitting there for five minutes waiting until I finally heard sirens get closer as a police cruiser pulled into my driveway. two men ran into my house as they saw me sitting in front of the basement as they slowly walked towards me. "Sir are you ok?" I looked over still in shock of what just happened. "yeah I locked the thing in my basement it is still probably down there." The two officers walked down the basement as they spent the next ten minutes down there halfway through they turned the power back on. as they walked back up. "Well we looked and it looks like the suspect escaped from the window we will have as many officers as we can spare try to track that bastard down but for now all we can ask is you get a good night's rest." They said this before walking out and driving off in there cruisers. it's important to note the lights in my basement don't work as I looked down there and saw the same blue eyes as I saw a smile as it placed a finger over it's mouth and crawled back into the darkness.   
I am telling you this to warn you be afraid of the dark any step could be your last.

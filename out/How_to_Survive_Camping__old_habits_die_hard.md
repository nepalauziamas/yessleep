I run a private campground.  One of the things I have to think about is fire management.  Obviously, there’s a lot of wood around here.  And obviously, if the campground goes up in flames, I lose my livelihood.  I do some land management to protect against that by clearing out dry underbrush periodically and put in rules about fire pits and my staff make routine inspections to make sure they’re followed.  Many of you have suggested using fire as a weapon against the inhuman things and each time I point out that this *is* a forest and while we don’t have a lot of dry wood, the odds of the entire thing going up are not zero.

[And then I went and threw a molotov cocktail into a room entirely made of wood](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lbfgpl/how_to_survive_camping_what_does_this_campground/).

In my defense, it wasn’t *technically* in the campground.  Only very technically.

Beau’s assistance had cleared the thorns from my body.  I spent a miserable few days coughing up plant matter.  At least it’s winter so we don’t have much work to do and I could sit in my house and play video games as a distraction.  I’m super obsessed with Octopath Traveler right now.

There were still the thorns planted throughout the campground to deal with, however.  I wasn’t terribly worried.  We had the stone, the one that contained the thorn’s death, and all I had to do was summon Beau and figure out what the next step was.

Of course, when I summoned him, he didn’t show.  I had even made hot chocolate with a bit of Bailey’s.  So I drank it all myself and then fueled by booze and a sugar high, I went tromping through the snow to find him.

The thought of him being in danger or otherwise unable to respond was only a vague worry.  He’s been elusive ever since I refused to go to the harvesters.  It’s hard to tell if he’s angry at me or just being moody.  It certainly isn’t because I’m good enough with a knife that I don’t need his help anymore.  I intended to ask him what the problem was, once I found him.  I decided to walk along the road through the deep woods, as that was both the safest place and where he tended to be found.

It took a few days of hiking around the campsite, but I eventually found Beau.  He was up ahead on the road, waiting for me.  As I approached, he turned and began walking again, so that I could catch up and we walked along side-by-side.

“I haven’t seen you much,” I said tentatively.

“I’m avoiding you.”

“That’s obvious.”

I waited, but no explanation was forthcoming.

“Did I… upset you?”

He seemed genuinely confused as to why, so I explained how I saw the situation.  How I’d ignored his suggestion and gone to the hall of the gummy bears instead.  He gave a soft laugh at that and reminded me - once again - that he was not human.

“Why would I take offense?” he asked.  “You made a choice that was yours to make.”

“Then why are you avoiding me?”

We walked along in silence for a bit more and the only sound was the packed snow crunching beneath our feet.  I was careful to keep some distance between us, keenly aware that my mere presence was contrary to his nature.  Like magnets, I thought, pushing each other away.

“You’re marked for death,” he finally sighed.  “It hovers over your head like a halo.  Here is my mark, wrought of blood.”

He stepped close and gestured, his hand passing through the space a few inches from my hair.

“There are more, now.  All of these bargains and debts you’ve accumulated, twisting together into a cord that will someday settle tight around your neck and take away your life.”

“And you’re bound to me,” I whispered.

He took a single step backwards, dropping his hand by his side, his expression grim.

“I feel the fomorian’s mark upon me as well.  I do not care to accumulate more.”

I asked him to describe them to me.  He hesitated, and then very reluctantly, told me a few.  One of shadow, trailing in the wind as if the slightest breeze would eradicate it.  I suppose that’s what happens when the person who made that mark is trapped inside the thing in the dark.  Good riddance to him.  Another of iron, shattered now, and crumbling.  The lady with extra eyes.  One of thorns, marking the intent of the fomorian.

And of course, a crown of teeth.  A very old crown, passed down along the family line.  The claim of the beast.

There were more, he said, but he refused to elaborate.  He seemed uneasy, as if merely describing them was more familiarity than he cared to have.  I didn’t press.  Honestly, I’m not sure I want to know exactly how many creatures have it out for me.  I’d probably never sleep again out of paranoia.

He soon turned off the road and into the woods.  I followed a bit more slowly, struggling through the deep snow.  The temperature has been in the teens lately, with the windchill bringing it down to single digits.  I envied Beau and his total indifference to the cold.

He led me to a patch of thorns.  It was one I knew of already and had tried to uproot.  The snow around it was mixed with loose soil from earlier attempts.  Let me tell you - it is really tough to dig up bushes in the middle of the winter with the ground as frozen as it is.

Beau extended his cup and held it up over the thorns.  He tilted it, slowly, until a thin stream of liquid poured forth.  It steamed in the cold air and melted the snow where it struck the ground at the base of the thorns.

“Is that it?” I asked softly.  “This will kill them?”

“Yes.  My cup carries the stone’s essence and the roots of the thorns will drink deeply of their own death.”

“I’m surprised you’re helping me so directly.”

“It’s not just for you,” he replied, his eyes narrowed as he watched the contents of his skull steam in the snow.  “This is my home and as you recall, I am unable to leave it.  I have no desire to be ruled by a tyrant.”

A thought occurred to me.

“Do the other inhabitants feel the same?”

“Of course.  Do you recall how the musician saved you from the horse?”

Ah.  I’d not thought too much of it at the time.  I was helping them out with the children, after all, so it stood to reason that they’d want to repay the favor by saving my life.  We stood in silence for a bit longer, watching the thorns shrivel into withered, dry branches where the liquid from Beau’s cup had touched them.  I could only imagine the roots were now doing the same.  Tentatively, I reached out and tapped one of the afflicted branches.  It broke off as if it were made of spun sugar and smashed into dust when it landed in the snow.  As if it’d been dead for centuries.

“Could I get help from the other inhabitants of the campground?” I asked.  “I know the fairy doesn’t want help, but we still have to deal with the formorian’s indirect effects on the land.”

“Don’t,” Beau replied sharply.  “You would only endanger them.  They won’t take such a risk.”

“You’re helping me,” I said pointedly.

He grunted and turned his back to me, walking back towards the road.

“I was already marked by my association with you,” he said.

When I was trapped in the dream that the master of the vanishing house had wove for me, I told it that I could not love it, for everything I love dies.  It feels like another lifetime ago.  I withdrew my hand from the bush and stuffed it in my pocket as I hastily followed Beau.

He went from bush to bush, repeating the process with each.  After a few more I realized that my presence was entirely unnecessary and probably even annoying to him, so I awkwardly thanked him and excused myself.

I went back to the house and played more video games.  I only felt a little guilty about it.

The next day I stumbled into the kitchen and brewed coffee.  Then, mug in hand, I went to the kitchen table and pulled back the curtains to get some early morning sunlight.

Beau was standing directly outside.

I screamed in surprise and dropped my mug.  It was my “Live, Laugh, Love” mug that I took from the camp lost and found so it wasn’t a huge loss.  We wind up with quite a few mugs in lost and found and hardly any of them get claimed.  After a year they become camp property.  I can’t remember the last time I *bought* myself a mug.

I invited Beau in while I cleaned up the mess.  He hovered uncomfortably in the archway between the kitchen and the living room, not saying anything.  Only when I was done mopping up coffee did I turn and ask him what he wanted.

He presented his cup in mute explanation.  Only a small drop of liquid remained inside.

“Where’s the pebble?” I asked, going to get my sharpest kitchen knife.

“I still have it, in case the fomorian plants more thorns.”

Blood from that which was already there.  Blood freely given.  I held out my palm and let my blood drop into the cup.

“Where do you plan on getting the blood forcibly taken?” I asked softly.

I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.  The only staff on site during the winter were my most trusted people, like Ed and Bryan.  I didn’t want any of them to be targets.

“I want to leave the campground.”

I sucked in an involuntary breath.  He wanted to take blood from someone outside my land.  One of the townspeople, perhaps.  They’d thrown an uproar over him poisoning a few people on Halloween.  I hated to think how they’d react to him *stabbing* someone.

“Do you have someone in mind?” I asked.

“I do.”“Will you kill them?”

“Will my answer change your decision?”

No.  It would not.  I *needed* Beau.  And Perchta’s warning… well, it was not so black and white as I’d assumed.  There was some flexibility here.

I wish I were surprised by how easily I slipped back into old habits.  The same old rationalizations.  Better someone else’s life than my own.  Better a stranger’s life than someone I know.  It feels inevitable that I would resort to this.  It takes more than a threat to turn someone into a good person.

I won’t apologize.  I won’t make excuses.  You know what kind of person I am.  I did the calculations, weighed my options, and this is what I chose.

I got my car keys and told Beau to come with me.

We went to someone that lived on the outskirts of town.  It took a while to get there, as Beau couldn’t tell me what roads to turn on.  He could only give directions in a vague sense, such as east or west.  At least he was patient.  He barely moved, sitting in the passenger seat, not wearing a seatbelt, with his cup cradled against his chest.  Finally, he told me we’d arrived and I pulled into the driveway of a small house surrounded by a stretch of overgrown field that was subsequently swallowed up by forest.  A black pickup truck was parked in the gravel driveway.

Beau got out.  I stayed where I was for a moment, nervously holding onto the steering wheel, and then I reluctantly followed him.  Better if I saw this through.  I had to know what I’d done.

He knocked on the door.  A man in his late forties, perhaps, answered.  His hair was thinning.  He squinted at Beau suspiciously.

And Beau… gestured with one hand.  Just a simple half-twist of his wrist.

The man coughed.  Blood spurted out of his mouth.  It streamed from his nose.  And my insides twisted with horror as his eyes began to leak blood, as it spilled out through his tear ducts.  It beaded up on his forehead, forced out through every one of his pores.  It streamed out of him through every available channel, soaking his clothing, dripping from his ears, and he twitched and shook and choked as his skin grew white and his heart raced and then finally collapsed on itself.

He landed face-first onto the pavement of his porch.  The blood floated above him as a red mist and Beau made another subtle gesture, directing it to gracefully stream like a river through the air and into his cup.  There was far more blood than the vessel could contain - an entire human body’s worth - but the cup never overflowed.  It filled and filled, brilliant crimson like a ruby, until there was none left to take.

The bloodless corpse lay on the ground with not a mark on it to indicate what had happened.

I realized that my hands were trembling.  I struggled to move, to find my voice.  Beau turned around and faced me and there was a soft, satisfied smile on his face.

“Have you *always* been able to do that?” I demanded, my voice coming out higher than I’d prefer, betraying my panic.

“Yes.”

The expression on the man’s face was burned into my mind.  His desperate agony, tears of blood streaming down his cheeks, his body rigid as his own blood clawed its way free of his veins.  I tried to banish it with something else.  Anything else.

“So the time I found a body like that and spent three weeks hanging garlic up everywhere thinking we had a vampire on the campground… that was *you*?”

“Yes.”

I took a breath, trying to calm my nerves.

“Do you have any idea how much I spent on garlic?!”

“Do I *care*?”

I whirled away from him and stalked back to the car, digging my hands into my hair.  Okay, the garlic didn’t matter.  I just… that was what came to my mind first.  Trying to bury what I’d just seen in something more mundane, I suppose.  Trying to distract myself from the fact that Beau could kill people in a far more horrifying way than simply slitting their throat or fatally poisoning them.

At least it was relatively fast.  I took a deep breath and opened my car door.  He’d threatened me with worse when I first met him.

It was a tense drive back to the campground.  When we were back on familiar roads I thought to ask Beau why he’d chosen this person, specifically.

“He double-parks.”

“And?”

He glanced at me in mild surprise.

“What else do you need?”

“Are you *kidding me*?  I just let you murder someone because they *double-park?*”

“Murder?” His tone was sharp.  “You let me refill my cup.  I drained it to save your land.  You ensured my *survival*.”

Whatever it takes.  The family tradition.  My grandfather killed his share to protect our land.  My parent’s hands certainly weren’t clean.  And nor are mine.

I wish I could say that was the end of it.  That I let Beau out once we were back at my house and he wandered off and nothing else happened.  But what we’d done was not going to go unnoticed.

I stayed up late that night.  I was awake because I was playing video games and making yet *another* attempt at killing that damn direwolf in Octopath Traveler, like seriously, why is that thing so hard to kill?  I must be doing something wrong.  So after watching my party get their faces ripped off for like the fifth time I finally turned the TV off and went to bed.  It was midnight.  The little girl was crying softly by the window.

I’d barely climbed into bed when she stopped.  I froze.  That was *never* a good sign.

“Oh no,” the little girl whispered.  “No no no no.”

I acted on instinct.  I threw myself out of bed and took cover behind it.  The little girl screamed in fright and then my window shattered.  The house shook with the impact.  For a moment everything was still, save for the tinkling of some glass remnants striking the ground and the wild sobbing of the little girl.

Then…

“Campground manager!” the fomorian bellowed.

My blood ran cold.  I felt frozen in place, cowering there next to the bed.  The fomorian’s voice came at a distance.  It wasn’t over the house’s property line, at least.

“I will find the one that killed my thorns at your behest!” it continued.  “I will drag him here and I will tear him apart, little by little, and eat him alive.  You will be helpless to watch and know what fate awaits you.”

Then I heard the cry of a horse and the sound of hoofbeats, receding into the distance.  A warning.  This was only a warning.

The fomorian intended to kill Beau.

Tentatively, I stood and turned on the bedside light.  There was a body wedged through the broken window.  It couldn’t fit through the frame, but it’d shattered the glass and now its head and part of its upper body was stuck.  The hood of its garment mercifully covered its face, for I recognized it by its bulk.

One of the musicians.  The fomorian had killed one of the dancer’s musicians.  And, my heart sinking, I knew that it had to be the one that had rescued me from the dapple-gray stallion’s hooves.

I kill everything I love.  Everything that gets close to me.

I’m a campground manager.  I am also my mother’s daughter and the product of generations that believed life was expendable and we were but prey to these inhuman things.  Herd animals, and sometimes one of our own had to be sacrificed to save the rest.

I’m certain that the new sheriff will find out about the body.  She might not assume it was me, but I’ll be involved regardless.  My family always is, when an odd death occurs.  She’ll send the old sheriff because he’s better at dealing with me.  And then what?  Do I lie to him?  I could.  I think he’d believe me.  I’ve gotten quite good at lying over the years doing this job.

It’s odd, how the thought of lying to him bothers me more than murdering that man did.  I suppose that’s a consequence of sentimentality.

Sometimes I think I feel too little and sometimes I wish I didn’t feel so much.  I’m starting to think… that maybe I’m a little more messed up inside than I thought.

Do I love Beau?  I… would be sad if he were gone.  Even after seeing what he did to that man.  The need to refill his cup was real, but the criteria with which he chose his victim was… petty.  That, I think, is cruelty.  Beau is cruel.  I can not defend him.  Yet humans are stupid, emotional things and we form attachments without even realizing it until one day we realize how painful their absence will be.  We bond with animals, with plants, and with people that don’t even exist - a character in a video game or a book.

I suppose I love Beau in the same way I love the barn cat with the kinked tail or the plant that my uncle gave me or Therion in Octopath Traveler.

im a teen girl in central northern canada so theres not much to do here rlly. the most fun in the winter is sledding or ice fishing w/o getting frostbite in -50Â°C weather so when it finally becomes summer were all happy, except for last yr. i was out wit sum friends at a lake near us. they lived on the rez on the other side of the lake so i had to take a boat out there. i was planning on staying out there for a few nights so i packed sum clothes, water, food, n my hunting gear since we wanted to hunt sum deer. i made sure the check the boat was full of fuel and off i went but halfway there the boat jus stopped. it was the middle of the day so i wasnt worried and thought another boat would see me but no one was out. strange. i didnt think too much of it really but it still felt weird. something was off.

after a few hours it started to rain. hard. i put the cover on the front of the boat and hid under there all night. the waves were crazy i thought the boat was gonna tip over and the boat started to fill wit water fast. at like 1am the rain stopped and i cleaned up and tried to start the boat again. nothing. absolutely nothing. "this is great" i thought. i tried to use the oar but it didnt help to move much and i couldnt see where i was going anyways since it was pitch black (it never is that far up in summer). i started to get this strange feeling like something was watching me from afar. a pair of eyes in the dark night staring directly at me but i cant see them. i decided to brush it off and try to call my friends. no service. "could this day get any worse?" i daid out loud, speaking to no one. apparently it could.

a few seconds later i heard a splash. not like a fish jumping out of the water but like a human or an animal getting thrown onto the water. i tries to look out but couldnt see anything. i slept wit my gun the entire night.

next morning. 6am. foggy out. great. i had a snack and a sip of rum from my flask my papa gave me as a present. i had no caffeine but for sum reason liquor woke me up. packed up my stuff, put on a hoodie, and tried to start the engine. i finally got it to work after a few hours of trying and started to head straight hoping to find land of sum sort. somewhere dry and safe.

i made it to this river part of the lake and docked my boat, and started walking to try and find a house or a building. i walked for a good 45 minutes when i decided to head back when i heard a scream. not a human scream, not an animal scream, but a guttering heart wrenching scream. i felt like my ears were gonna blead even after covering them. when whatever it was stopped screaming, i looked up and saw this shadow. it was a good 20 feet tall with these deer like antlers and a thin body that looked to be made out of bones and flesh. i quickly picked up my gun and ran as fast as i could back to my boat. i slipped in mud and water until i saw my boat, jumped in, and started it as fast as i could and sped off. i didnt know where i was going but i was going away from that river. forever.

i finally got to my friends but i couldnt get that thing off my mind. i could barely sleep the entire time i was there. everytime i tried i got horrible nightmares. on the third day there i decided to head back. my friends ex said hed come wit me to make sure i got back safe. i never liked him. he was always a snob for being a poor native boy. he always got in trouble but i let him come anyways since i didnt want to be alone.

we left at noon, early enough that it was light out and other boaters were out. he wanted to go to this abandoned cabin first since he stashed a lot of his stuff there when his parents kicked him out for being an idiot boy. he also used it as a smoke shack. once we got there, everything felt, dark. i had an eerie feeling that i couldnt shake off. i told him we should leave but he said "stop being a wuss and man up will ya?" so i listened and followed him. ive been there before but this time it felt different. we were there for a good 20 minutes before he got what he "needed", which was sum weed and rum and sum shrooms and sum bullets for his hand gun. 

as soon as we were about to leave, we heard a bang. not like a gun shot or a tree falling, but like a large mammal fell or jumped from a high place. we looked out the window and saw what i saw at the river. a large thing wit deer like antlers, skin and bone, 20 feet tall, towering over the small cabin. we started to run for the door then ran to the boat as fast as we could. my friends ex tripped over a root and fell on his face. i yelled at him to get up but it seemed as tho he hurt his foot. i wanted to run back but that thing got closer and closer to him. i froze. the thing grabbed him by the leg and tore him up. that thing ripped him up like he was a useless peice of paper. i almost threw up at the sight the thing stared at me. its eyes were black and hollow, but it felt like it was staring into my soul. after a few seconds it ran away, back into the forest.

i made it back and i could barely speak. no one believed me obviously, as who would? if sum teen girl said she saw a monstrous thing rip her friends ex in half and not her and run away, would you believe her? i wouldnt if i wasnt her but i am her, and i know what happened. were supposed to go up again this year at the same time but i dont think i can bring myself to leave the farm even after that. the woods now terrify me, lakes and rivers make me shiver, and remote cabins make me sleepless. i wish that day never happened. i wish i would have died that day. but if it was just me, no one would be dead right?

I’m just looking for someone to take this seriously, please. I (20M) and my girlfriend (21F) have been living our new home for about 6 months now, and haven’t experienced much on the paranormal side since we moved in. I don’t say nothing totally because there have been some weird things, hearing our names around the house when no is talking, or even home in some instances. Weird things in the corner of eyes, figures that are not formed enough to make any discerning figures, and then of course our attic. Me and her are horror junkies, so jokes about the odd sounds of steps or scratching are not too out of the typical for her and I. 

That all changed last month. Me and her recently gained new roommates to help with the financial stress that comes along with being on our own for the first time. The room located next to ours, belongs to my girlfriend’s friend from middle school, and hasn’t mentioned anything strange. The first and only instance that ever occurred, at least of my knowledge, happened when I was getting her room live in ready. There’s a small door that leads into the attic, which makes no sense to me since there’s an upper entrance in our hallway. The stranger part is, the door is sealed, completely un openable, and isn’t accessible without a ladder. I was cleaning the floor in the room when right above I heard an audible thud. I mention audible because there are noises that happen up there all the time, but none of them loud enough to cause any worry, or sometimes even noticeable. This time was most definitely different, it was odd enough for me to take a double take noticing the small vibration of the small square door above me. There isn’t much to follow that up with, other than that small occurrence. 

After that, making my way into the attic was always a worry of mine, and still is to this day. A strange eeriness has completely killed my excitement for having a place big enough for a top storage space. The noises have gotten louder, and what’s more concerning is that no one else seems to notice them. It’s been quite tonight, as a matter of fact it’s been quiet for the last couple of weeks actually, which scares me. My girlfriend noticed a figure in our door a couple weeks ago, right around when it got quiet. Once the sounds stop the presence grows stronger. Like I mentioned it’s been a quiet night, and we haven’t heard anything yet. I’m worried, terrified even. I don’t what prompted me to write this, the only I know for sure is my eyes won’t stop looking at the small vent above our room, one that leaves us visible if you’re looking in from the attic, even writing this I feel as if I need to do it in a hurry. 

It’s watching us from up there, waiting. Our cat hasn’t broken its stare from up there either. Locked in a staring contest, I wait. Someone is watching us from the attic, and it knows I’m looking right back at it. I’ll post an update in a couple days, assuming I make it to then.

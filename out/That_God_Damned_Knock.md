   At first I thought the knock at my door was normal. Every day, sometime around 4-5 pm my mom gets home from work. She lets me know she’s home every single day by that knock.
One day, I got a knock at my door at 4:30, “Hi honey!” 

    I answered, “Hey! I’ll be out in a moment.”
A few minutes later, I stepped out of my room into the hallway connecting the bedrooms and the living room. 
Then I saw my mom, sitting on the couch reading her phone. 
 
  “How was your day?” I asked
“Busy! But good, what about you?”
“Mine was okay! I’ve just been chillin today.”
“Oh good.” 
Then I went back into my room for a bit, and 15 minutes later I started hearing what I thought was another knock at my door. “Ya?” I asked.

  I stepped out of my room, and I heard the banging coming from the bathroom. The door was open… What I saw next was horrific. She was banging her head against the mirror as fast and as hard as she could. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Her blood splattered against her reflection… Then she turned toward my direction after a moment, looking directly at me. She paused for a moment, smiled, and said,

  “Wanna join? It’s fun! I promise!”
I screamed, “What the fuck mom?!? What are you doing??” I ran towards her, grabbing her by the shoulders, making sure she couldn’t hit herself anymore. 

  She opened her eyes as wide as she could, and rolled them back into her head. She said calmly, “You’ll see how fun it is.”
I ran to the front door, got in my car, and said “NOPE THE FUCK TO THAT.”


  I called my step dad and told him to get to the house as fast as possible so we could either take her to a psych ward or a church. Then she stepped out of the front door. Her eyes were now pitch black, and she was cackling… I started to cry. What the fuck happened??? She was normal just a few fucking minutes ago! 
Then she appeared in the passenger seat in my car in an instant. She asked, “Where are you going sweetie?” With the worst, guttural, fake, garbage impersonation of my mom I’ve ever heard. 

  Then I blacked out. I woke up in my bed and the time read 9:00 AM. What kind of dream was that? Jesus. 
I stepped out of bed, and I opened my bedroom door. That’s when I saw it. On my living room couch were my two parents. Their mouths were more open than humanly possible with their eyes missing, watching static on the TV.

   I panicked, I got back in my room and locked the door. I’m writing this now. They don’t seem to have moved since, because I haven’t heard any footsteps. I have spent hours trying to call for help. But the only thing that happens when anyone answers is they say, “You don’t have much time left.”

   I don’t know what to do. I think I’m just gonna kill myself. It would probably be much less painful and scary. I’m so scared. I’m so fucking scared.

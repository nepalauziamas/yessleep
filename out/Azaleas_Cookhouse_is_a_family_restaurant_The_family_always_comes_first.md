Part 4: The Last Supper (Final) 

&#x200B;

The crowd feasted their eyes on the drama ensuing. The woman who I believed to be Keith’s sister had a fiery look in her eyes. I felt horrible for her family, but she was looking for answers to questions that I just couldn't provide. Silva had me backed into a corner with jail time or collateral damage as the only ways out.

“Can we relax for a second?” I pleaded. “I’m just the neighbor—Marc. That's it.” 

“Well you two sure looked like cozy neighbors,” she scoffed. Her hands were shaking as she placed her phone to her ear. 

“Stop for a Goddamn second!” I yelled. There was a gasp from someone in the crowd. The woman resembling Keith nearly dropped her phone. “Call the cops then. Go on. Is going to the bar a crime? You’ll do nothing but look crazy.”

The woman glared back, eventually taking the phone from her ear. She placed it in her palm, squeezing it violently as she screeched. I took a step back, as did some of the closer shoppers. 

“She did something to him, “ she declared, tears welling in her eyes. “I know it.” She pointed her finger at me, her body trembling, “And if you're stupid enough to be with her, she will do the same to you.”

There was silence for a moment as the woman paced around the lot. She eventually began to sob as she found a seat on the curb, her face shielded by her hands. The crowd slowly dispersed. Once she calmed down, we were able to make a proper introduction. Her name was Viola and she confirmed that she was Keith’s baby sister. Keith was her only sibling, and she became concerned when he didn't respond to her text messages Friday evening. When he no-showed for their brunch plans Saturday morning, that's when she really began to worry. Paulina had recently decided the family was going to move out of the country with little warning or consultation provided to Keith. This was how Paulina was—the qualities that made her fun were also what made her dangerous. Keith had become fed up with her unpredictable nature and the extended family was worried that with the move they would never see their children again.

All I could offer were some hollow words of encouragement: remain calm and hope for the best. I could tell they did little to soothe her soul. We eventually said goodbye, the lies tossing around in the pit of my stomach knowing that the man was never coming home.

With one bomb carefully diffused, I went home to think about the major issue at hand. My plan to build a closer relationship with Paulina had gone up in flames. There was no new information garnered, the opportunity had been wasted. I suffered one more sleepless night, and before I knew it the weekend was over.

In the morning, I peeked out my window. Paulina’s driveway was empty. 

On my way to work, I saw Viola walking down the street with a small group of people. They were maybe three blocks from my house. In her hand was a stack of papers. At one of the nearby light posts, I pulled over to look at what they were taping to the metal structures:

*HELP BRING KEITH BARGALLO HOME*

*Keith Bargallo:  a loving husband, devoted father and upstanding member of our community has been missing since Friday, April 30th. There is a cash reward for anyone who can provide information on his whereabouts or the whereabouts of his wife, Paulina, and their two children, Riley and Colton.* 

*Help us bring him home.* 

*Please call the number below.* 

*XXX-XXX-XXXX*

The photo on the flyer was a family portrait taken at a nearby park. The image haunted me all the way to the restaurant.

\*\*\*\*

There was the usual rush of workers when I arrived at Azalea’s. They were scuttling through the halls, heading to the nearby change rooms, and preparing the tables for the upcoming dinner service. As I left the front of the house towards the change room, I caught a glimpse of Silva. He was walking at a brisk pace down the hall with a couple of other associates. It was only a quick flash of his black and silver crewcut, it was only the back of his head, but that’s all it took to make me suddenly feel cold. 

Dwayne was dawdling around by his locker with a couple of the other cooks when I entered. “You have a good weekend, Marc?” he grinned. “Ready for some more training? This time, I won't go easy.” 

“Sorry, Dewayne,” I said while taking off my shoes. “I told you that shift ain't for me. I’m back to serving today.” 

“Well, that’s news to me. Silva told me I was training you this evening.”

“Well he must have forgotten,” I grumbled. “ I discussed this with him on Friday.” 

Dewayne shrugged, “Either way, it doesn't matter to me. Just let me know what he says before the rush starts.” He playfully swatted one of the cooks in the belly before leaving, “Let’s go get that money!”

I stared blankly at the lockers as flashbacks of Friday entered my brain: the contorted bodies stuffed in the dish cart, the squishing of bloated flesh, the cracking of bones. There was no way in hell I was ever going back to bussing. Silva and I would need to have another word. 

After I changed into my uniform, I went to help set the tables and fold some last-minute cutlery. I hoped to cross paths with Silva; he was usually running up and down the halls leading up to service, but today I wasn’t so lucky. His office door was locked and my knocking went unanswered. Lana gave me a wave down the halls. I had already seen Greg at the lockers and passed by Steph and Kelly wrapping cutlery. By my count, we were fully staffed for servers and that number excluded me. 

With 20 minutes to go before service, I began to panic. I asked Mia, the hostess, if she had seen Silva. 

She shrugged, “Sorry, haven't seen him.” 

“Does he have any appointments?” I asked, scratching my head.

She scrolled through the tablet and shook her head. As I approached the hostess podium, I noticed something resting on one of the shelves behind it. It was a cellphone with a glittery phone case and a distinct Hello-Kitty tassel attached to it. 

“Julie working tonight?” 

“No. Just me,” she sighed. “Worked all weekend, too. So freakin’ sick of this place...”

I pointed to the phone behind the podium. She replied,  “Oh my God. Wow. Didn't even notice that! She must have been going nuts all weekend.”

Before Mia could continue, Lana approached and asked a question about the menu. The server whisked her away towards one of the dining rooms in order to investigate the error. Before she left, Mia said, “I'll stop by her place tonight and drop it off. Thanks, Marc.” 

I gave a wary smile.

Once they left, I began to snoop around the podium. On the bottom shelf, there was a black purse. It had a matching tassel, the stupid cat seemed to be waving at me from the ground. 

I froze. Her wallet, her keys—everything was in the bag.

I remembered the note and suddenly my limbs felt weak. I jumped to the only logical conclusion:

*Julie never left.*

I wandered down the halls, rummaging through the storage rooms in the kitchen and the dish room. I opened any door I walked past, searching for signs of Julie. My heart beat aggressively in my chest with every failed attempt. There was no doubt that Dewayne was looking for me too; my watch told me that the dinner crowd would be arriving any minute. 

I felt a cold hand grab my shoulder from behind. I flinched.

“Geez, Marc. Relax, “ Lana laughed. “They’re gathering everyone together in Room #1.”

I followed her down the empty hallway. Monday nights were always our slowest, but the complete absence of foot traffic was very concerning.

“What’s going on?” I asked.

“I don't know. They just told me to sweep the halls and find any stragglers. I think you’re the last one.” 

When we arrived a bald, burly man held the door open. He was a familiar face, someone I seldom saw this deep inside the restaurant. He wasn’t an employee as far as I knew, just some sort of supplier of ingredients and various cooking supplies to the restaurant. 

You could feel the heat coming from the crowd before you even entered the room. There were too many people for the cramped space: the air was musky as employees seated across the long table looked aimlessly across the room. Those that weren't early enough to nab seats were standing in a line along the walls. On top of the table were beautiful arrays of mouth-watering appetizers: bacon-wrapped prunes, blini with caviar, beef tartare, and cheese fondue. A strange man with squinty eyes was pouring shots of alcohol out of mini liquor bottles while the bald man from the doorway followed him towards the table holding a bottle of wine. They passed around glasses to everyone.

“Wine or liqueur?” the squinty man asked.

Through pursed lips, I replied, “I’m okay.”

“Wine or liqueur?” he repeated. “Come on, we’re celebrating!” he winked. 

I hesitated for a moment, then pointed towards the bottle of red that the bald man was holding. He poured a generous amount and handed me a glass. 

“Is this everyone?” he asked the room. A couple of people nodded their heads in assurance.

“Okay. Well, first off, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Sergio. I’m one of the main investors in Azalea’s.”

Lana and myself shared puzzled looks. I had never seen this man before.

“The success of this restaurant has not been lost on myself or any of the other investors. We are incredibly proud of what this restaurant has accomplished, and that starts with each and every one of you.” He raised a glass, “I propose a toast:  to the staff that makes this place special–from the cooking staff to the servers, the hostesses to the busboys. You are all an integral part of this family and we need to do a better part of showing our gratitude.” 

While Sergio spoke, I began to scan the room. There was still no sign of Julie, or better yet, no sign of Silva. I clinked my glass against Lana’s and a few other employees in my vicinity, holding the brim of the glass to my lips. Some of the wait staff and hostesses downed their drinks and were nibbling at the finger food. Some of the line cooks and junior chefs were pouring themselves another round with delighted smiles across their faces. This was the first teambuilding event in all my years at the restaurant, so many of the workers seemed to be making the most out of the occasion. But those that knew better held their ground. Dewayne held his full glass to his hip with a stern expression. Elsa was sitting at the table, her chef hat flopping out of her pocket, her glass untouched. I'd seen too much death to enjoy the offerings—Not an ounce of alcohol was going to hit my throat.

“You should try the tartare,” Lana whispered. “It’s delectable.”

I smiled, wine glass still to my mouth, as I eyed the exit. I slowly shuffled towards the door as the speech continued.

“Tonight—we celebrate our employees. Dinner service has been canceled. And don't worry – taxi services will be provided to those who will need it.”

The roar from the room was deafening.

 “Before we start the festivities, there is one more exciting announcement.”

 The door slowly creaked open, the sound lost amongst the celebration.

“We will be reopening at a new location. A much bigger venue.” The excitement slowly shifted into nervous apprehension. “Do not worry,” Sergio assured the crowd. “You will all be welcomed back with open arms. Azalea’s needs each and every one of you!” 

The dim light sparkled off the chandeliers in an eyrie dance as I strolled through the halls. I walked past the foyer, into the kitchen, and then down the grungy, abandoned hallway. With everyone preoccupied with the party, it gave me an opportunity to go digging for some answers. As I made it closer to the elevator, I detected movement. My walk turned into a run as I saw Martin’s lanky figure. The door to the elevator was slowly closing.

I pounded my feet into the concrete and sprinted as fast as I could. With an outstretched hand, I managed to activate the sensor just as the door was closing.

“What the fuck are you doing?” he barked. 

I grabbed him by his scrawny neck and pinned him to the back of the elevator. “Take me down. Now.”

He flailed and sent a powerful kick to my stomach. I noticed his hands were coated in a thick layer of blood.  Wheezing and clutching my midriff, I yelled, “Take me to the bodies, you scum,”

We grappled with each other into the hallway. He managed to clip me on the side of the head with a shot that made me wobble. With gritted teeth, we both struggled for control. I wrestled with him, holding his body close to mine as I tried to gather my composure. The dim light from the elevator was sparking like little flashes of lightning. The room was spinning, but somehow with a sudden burst of energy, I managed to connect with a short jab. It stunned Martin long enough for me to push him into the wall. He went flying, his head hitting the corner of the walls exposed brick. There was a deep thud and then his body collapsed to the floor. A small trail of blood trickled out of the side of his head, forming a tiny puddle on the floor.

I scrambled to his body, rummaging for his access key. There were sounds coming out of me that I’d never heard before. Uncontrollable sobs. Moans of sorrow. I found the card in his back pocket and booked it for the elevator. As the doors began to close, I noticed the flashing red light coming from the ceiling. The camera was pointed in my direction.

 The odor was crippling, it crept up the shaft and seeped through the cracks of the elevator doors. The elevator carriage rumbled as I slowly descended into the unknown. The doors eventually slid open to reveal what looked like an ongoing construction project. The framing and some of the drywall had been completed, but the floor was packed dirt, and darkness seemed to cover large sections of the room. There were lights strung up on the ceiling, but there was little done to mask the smell. If there wasn't a pile of gas masks laid out by the entrance, I surely would have vomited. 

I followed the hanging, glowing orbs down the cold tunnel. It only took a couple of paces before I saw the industrial-sized fridge. It was a massive stainless steel house with a large sliding door. I shivered as I entered the unit. Inside were shelves and shelves of plastic bags:

 Hearts, livers, lungs, intestines, vials of blood.

Names of either the victims or the new recipients were written in permanent marker. Everything was sealed, labeled, and organized. I tiptoed deeper into the cool room, only making it a few more steps before I finally screamed. 

Silva was rigid and face-up, lying on top of a pile of bodies. The thousand-dollar suits and flowing gowns were all lined with speckles of frost. Silva’s eyebrows were covered in an icy white, his expression frozen in a look of terror. The bullet wound was right through the center of his skull.

At that moment, I understood that this was so much more than a murder-for-hire operation. It was so much more than a restaurant. Everything seemed to turn a profit.

I ran out of the cool room and started pacing outside of the unit. I wanted so badly to go back up the elevator, to make my way to safety. But I knew I was on the cusp of the secrets, there was still so much I didn't know potentially down the hall. So I foolishly pressed forward.

 As I went further into the basement, the smell intensified. The piles of bodies were in plain sight—if you could even call them bodies anymore.

I removed my mask just in time to unleash a violent wave of chicken casserole.

Their stomachs were fleshy, gaping holes, hacked away with little left of their insides except for the rib cages and bone that held the remaining bits of skin together. Their faces had no eyes, just black holes carved out of the now rotting flesh. The maggots were little white dots in a sea of decomposed skin, festering all through the crevices of what was left. The dirt floor had clearly been disturbed in numerous places. 

*Jesus. Christ.*

Something drew me towards one of the hands dangling from the middle of the pile. It was dainty, the fingernails painted in a pastel pumpkin. The flamboyant color palette looked familiar, like something Julie would wear. As I pulled, heaps of limbs and serrated bones toppled from the top of the tower of bodies. Roves of beetles and blowflies buzzed from all of the commotion.

I recoiled, losing my footing on some loose sediment. 

In the corner of my eye, I spotted the meat grinder at the end of the room. The piece of machinery was hiding in the shadows, kept from plain sight. As I got closer, I could see that the thing looked polished to perfection. Sinister thoughts flooded my brain regarding its purpose. 

*Some off-menu items for an extra cost? A special order of beef tartare?*

I dry-heaved, nearly losing my lunch once again.

I couldn't experience the gruesome scene any longer. These were all of Azalea’s deepest, darkest secrets. Secrets that some of the family members took to the grave. 

I needed to get out of here before I suffered the same fate.

There was a thundering sound of footsteps and scraping coming from the roof. I made a mad dash for the elevator. I strode past Martin’s body down the hall and made it through the empty kitchen. I managed to round the corner of the foyer before I heard shouting:

“Hey! Stop!”

The bald man was wheeling one of the dish carts out of Room #1. Dewayne was wheeling another behind him.

I took flight up the stairs, hearing the pounding of ominous footsteps behind me. I managed to exit the parking lot before they were able to get close.

\*\*\*

I told you at the start of this, that I was a nobody. I was just a lowly server. I was no mastermind. 

I was no criminal, despite what the security tapes may show.

There was no plan. There was nothing. Just a series of events that unfolded after that evening.

There was no gun. Although, I did think about this often during my fits of insomnia. I would have been too much of a coward to ever pull the trigger. But if anyone deserved a bullet in their brain, it was Silva. It would have been satisfying to do the honor, but the end result was the same.

There was no fake passport. I just didn't know where to get one.

There was no burner phone. I just never had the gumption to follow through.

In the end, there was just me and the open road. 

My first stop was a small-town bank in the early morning. I withdrew all the cash that I could and loaded it into a suitcase. I kept driving, only stopping to load up on fuel or to reload on convenience store food and energy drinks. I kept going for a few days until I reached the Mexican border. I prayed they would let me through, and for some reason, my prayers were answered. The Azalea family always proved to be a tight-lipped bunch. 

There is a beach along the coast just outside of a small town. I remember the recommendation from a dear friend. It is off the beaten path and far away from tourists. I think the name was El Desembo. Or maybe Desemboke? My Spanish was never the greatest, it just seemed like a good place to stop. 

The water was crystal clear and the beach was quiet. I sat in the sand just in time to watch the sunset. There were a few other Mexican teenagers splashing around in the water, and a handful of fishermen dragging around empty nets across the beach. There was one other person, the only other gringo that I’ve seen. Her hair is an unusual midnight-black for her fair complexion and her smile seems to glimmer in a familiar way. She’s all alone and out of place, but most of all, she looks happy. Gazing at her sprawled out on a beach towel, for some reason, I feel the need to make a call.

I dial the number, the same one from the poster.

“Hello?”

“Viola?”

“Uh..yes. And who is this?”

“It was her,” I said. “You were right all along.” 

And I tell her everything I know about everything.

\*\*\*

The sun dips below the horizon, the sky suddenly a murky marmalade. It is harder and harder to see with every passing second.

My mind wanders into the dark recesses of my brain, towards the memories I’ve tried to forget. I think about my time at Azalea’s, and how great the job was before it wasn’t. I think about my coworkers. I think about Julie.  I think about how close I came to death. I think about the others who weren’t so lucky. I think about the life I took and the one that got away.

The beach is empty now: the fishing boats are all secured and hitched to the dock for the evening. My vision is hazy in the shadows of the night, but I still hear the playful frolicking in the water and the soothing splash of the waves against the rocks. 

At this moment, I am sure this is the most beautiful place in the world.

It’s a matter of time before they find me. Whether they track my cell signal from the nearby towers or they find the footage from the restaurant. Tomorrow, I will be in another town, and another after that, for as long and as far as my money will take me. 

For now, I sit and take in the crashing of the waves, avoiding the dead, restless eyes that will come for me in my sleep.

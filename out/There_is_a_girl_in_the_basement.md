If you have ever babysat you have a scary story and I think mine wins, this is one story that still haunts me to this day, Halloween night 2013. I was working as a babysitter in my local area, I was probably 15 or 16 when this happened. I talked to many therapist after this and they all told me the same thing. It would take me while to get over this, something I could of figured out on my own but I suppose they gave me a few tricks to get me back to what, normal? How could anyone be normal after this?

Anyway, I went to this young girls house. I think she was about nine. Everything was going fine until about 8 o'clock. She asked me for some ice cream and her mom had told me she was allowed some earlier that night. Fine, I get up down to the basement where they kept a freezer as their kitchen was quite small. I glanced up at the window they had at the top, you know where it would be on the ground if you where stood outside, it was angled down slightly so anything in it looked to be staring at me, I take a step back when I see a young girls face. I feel fear run through me but it looks like a mask. As I said, Halloween night. It was probably some stupid kids messing about so I go and grab the ice cream, still a little shaken up. I didn't want to scare the girl, so I kept this to myself and would go back down and check before calling the police. Looking back that was the most stupid idea I have ever had.

I got her some in a bowl, she then looks at me with a sorrow look. "Could I have some sprinkles?" She says with a hint of sadness in her voice. The old puppy dog eyes. I sigh and head back down the stairs and look at the window again, looking back this whole thing could of been prevented if the family kept the sprinkles upstairs. Still there. I'm getting annoyed and decide I will go back up and discretely contact her mom or maybe the police. I get up there and she looks like she is about to say something before we hear a loud thud come from down the stairs in the basement. I look at the girl and calmly say "Stay here, I think something fell." She complies and I speed walk over to the door, phone in hand ready to call 911. I get down and first thing is first, look at the window. shattered? I can't stop myself running over but then I hear a blood curdling scream come from upstairs. I sprint quickly and I'm met with a horrific sight. The girl is face first in her ice cream, a stab mark in the back of her head and the front door wide open.

The police and parents get here, so do my parents. I'm crying uncontrollably which is understandable. I begin to tell the police everything and when I get to the bit about the window, her mom looks at me, white as snow. She then say the words that still appear in my nightmares to this day.

"Hunny, we don't have a window in our basement, the planners wouldn't let us. What you saw is.." she pauses before the next phrase leaves her mouth. 

"A mirror"

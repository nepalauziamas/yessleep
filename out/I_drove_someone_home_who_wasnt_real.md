It was late at night, 1:37 to be exact. I had gotten off work, but stayed after closing to help clean up a bit. On the way home, theres a long road with almost no people on it at all times. Today was sort of different.

There was a hitchiker, normal at times. It looked like she has been homeless for months, years even. I was in the same boat at one point, and I loved helping people. 

I rolled my window down and said, "You need a ride?"

"Thank you so much sir." She hopped in the car relentlessly and thanked me over and over.

"Dont call me sir, call me Matthew." I was a very nice person.

"Matthew, you are a life saver."

"Well, I wouldn't go that far." I looked in the mirror, "Where to?"

She smiled and stated, "Its kind of on a back road, Ill give you directions."

We were driving when she asked me, "Have you ever done this before?"

I just chuckled and said, "Lets just say, according to you, Im an angel."

She laughed and said, "Your a funny one. First funny one yet even."

I glanced at her. "First yet?"

She looked through the mirror. "Ive been hitchhiking since Boston, my mom lives down here and I want to see if I can be her daughter again."

I smiled. "Thats sweet, if you dont mind, could you tell me what happened?"

She looked at me, almost like a thank you. "Ive needed to tell someone this. I came out to my mom when I was 14. She screamed and cursed at me, telling me to go to your no good father in Boston, saying he will deal with me. He never did, and I stayed there."

I was at a loss for words. "I-I am so sorry you had to go through that."

She just looked at me, cracked a small smile and said, "If you heard what else she sis, your opinion would change lightning fast, turn here by the way."

We both started laughing, and I didnt even realize what road we turned down. It was a long dirt road. 

"Im on the right road correct?"

She smiled and said "Yes, I climed that tree every day when  was a kid."

We sat in silence for the rest of the ride. When she finally said to stop here, it was a small little house.

"Again, thank you so much."

I looked at her and said, "Anytime."

She smiled and walked up the door, I looked in the back seat to see if she left anything. She did, a peice of paper."

"Hey, your for-" She was already gone. I chuckled and continued my drive home. In the middle of it, I go curious. I opened up the folded paper and it said, 

"To Matty, call me, xoxo. 382-555-7504. I decieded to save her in my phone. I was gonna ask to take her out.

I woke up the next day at 9:45. I picked up my phone, and decided to text her. My phone was blowing up.

"HELP"

"MATTHEW SHES STABBING ME"

"COME QUICK"

I drive to the house as fast as I could. I drive down the whole road, and there was nothing. I got out of the car and walked around. Still nothing. I then found a note that said, "YOU WERE TOO LATE :(" Blood was smeared all over the paper. I looked up, and there she was.

But she looked different. It was my therapist. "Matthew? You were telling me about the hitchiker?" 

"O-oh yes, I will continue. It was late at night, 1:37 to be exact. I had gotten off work, but stayed after closing to help clean up a bit."

When I was 15 I worked at a small diner, you wouldn’t see to many things happen there, quiet area for people to sit down and have a nice quiet lunch. Except when Danny and his goons would come in. I went to school with Danny and he was known for being a top notch bully, like I’m talking pulling knives out because a kid wouldn’t show him his homework answers, he was basically just a very violent person. I mean it made sense because that’s what his family was known for, their violent acts in our town. No one ever did anything because they made it seem like no one could. His dad was a hunter and his mom, used to be an um, brothel employee? 

I was working an 8 hour shift after school, about 3 hours in I see Danny and his goons enter the diner, my first thought was “oh no, I hope he forgot the knife” he walks over to me at the front counter and makes a joke about how I should be opening my shirt to get more customers for the diner. I rolled my eyes and just said “okay anything else?” Annoyed with my answer he said “how about show me something now or I won’t tip” all I do is look at him, turn and walk into the back, with him yelling at me as I’m walking away I tell my manager and he goes out to get the rest of their order. 

After they left I went back out on counter and continued my shift, once it was over I had just left the diner doors when I feel a harsh grip on my arm wreath me behind a dumpster. Scared I looked up to see Danny grinning a sick smirk. I go to yell and he covers my mouth and says “I fucking hate it when people embarrass people for no reason, what the fuck did I do you bitch?!” Tears started welling in my eyes as he reach for something in his pants, i Immediately knew what he was reaching for. His dads hunting knife that he used to cut and hurt the kids at our school. He raised the blade up to my face flaunting it saying how easy he could kill me with that knife. I looked into his eyes hoping he’d have some sort of clarity and stop this but that had no effect, he just stared back with heartless emotionless eyes. I started to feel a horrible stinging on my neck. He had begun to drag the blade along my throat leaving a open wound. I couldn’t do anything except struggle and try to scream in pain, until I had an outburst of ‘I’m gonna die’ adrenaline. I shoved him off me to the ground and kicked him repeatedly everywhere until he dropped the knife, I picked it up and stood above him, feeling a strong emotion I can never explain. I booked it towards the woods surrounding the diner. (I walk home from the woods so I knew this area well). 

As my stamina grew weak and the tree branches hitting me repeatedly as I run through the thick condensed Forrest, I could hear his footsteps growing closer and closer to me, I thought he must be beginning to slow down now that he’s been running for a while, i steadied my pace as I caught up to the fucker. 


Sorry for the horrific amount of typos, it’s 5am, I’m on the toilet and too lazy to review the spelling and punctuation :P

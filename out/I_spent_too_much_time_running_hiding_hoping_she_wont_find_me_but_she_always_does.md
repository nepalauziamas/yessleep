 

I am not in denial; I know I brought it all on myself, and I see now that I couldn’t run from my demons forever. If I am being completely honest with myself, I think I always knew that. My wife is not a bad person, if she was, I wouldn’t be caught dead in the same room with her, (pun not intended) never mind considering getting back with her. Despite the constant kidnapping attempts, I know she really loves me, and I certainly love her, why wouldn’t I, we had many happy years together, and feelings don’t go away just because you want them to.  

Besides, none of this is her fault, if I didn’t leave her when she needed me the most none of this would have happened, I don’t know how I expected her to deal with that *situation,* when I couldn’t. I did regret it eventually and tried to contact with her, but it was too late, she was too far gone. Even then I might have been able to do something if I wasn’t so much of a coward, it still eats away at me knowing I left her like that. 

I have been on the run for a long time now, trying to escape my family. I even left the country for a while, but it was no use, she kept finding me, I have no idea how. The last time was by far the worst, she actually got into my room while I was sleeping. If she hadn’t dropped the syringe and woke me up, I would have never even known she was there. It was so fucked up, she had a rope, a big black bag, even a trolley to carry me out of there. The weirdest thing about it was, when I woke up and found her, she didn’t seem to believe she was doing anything wrong, she even asked me to sit still so she could tie me up. 

As I was running out the door she said, “silly daddy always playing games, does he not know, he is going to have to come home sooner or later” in a calm and cheerful tone, which freaked the hell out of me. 

After that I stopped running and tried a different approach, I thought I would beat her at her own game, so I stalked her for a while. I figured at least that way, I always knew where she was. I found out she was staying in a motel a few blocks up from where I was staying. This time I was one step ahead of her, and laid a trail of breadcrumbs so she would end up exactly where I wanted her to be, for once. 

I stopped using aliases and used my real name in a couple of hot spots in town where I thought she might inquire about me. It was weird, it was so long since I had any real conversations with anyone. Usually, I kept to myself and tried not to go to the same place too often, in hopes they wouldn’t remember me. So, when I got a chance to talk, I became quite the chatter box, I told them my whole life story, even where I was living, well not exactly; I gave this homeless guy, Bob, money to rent out a room next to mine and switched rooms with him, the best thing about it was outside my window there was a fire escape, just in case I had to leave in a hurry. 

My plan was simple, while she was breaking into my motel room looking for me, I would break into hers and see what she was up to. It didn’t take long for her to get on my trail, I saw her talking to one of the waitresses in the diner down the street from me. I knew that she would come for me that night, so I sat outside her motel and waited for her. At about 12:30 am I saw her leave in a little white van, that she probably rented out just to kidnap me. I was still her husband and had the ID to prove it, so I went to the desk and told them it was our anniversary and I wanted to surprise her, and just like that he gave me the key.  

As I was standing in the hallway outside her room trying to figure out what to do, I heard a woman's voice, I was so confused, I knew it couldn’t have been my wife. But I put my ear up to the door to listen for a while just to make sure. I then heard a woman singing some sort of lullaby, for a moment I thought it might have been the wrong room, until I heard the unmistakable sound of my sons laughter. I was shocked, I never thought she would have brought him all that way. I thought of walking in there and taking my son, it probably would have been the best thing for everyone, besides me, but I wasn’t ready to take on that kind of responsibility just yet. I felt awful over it, I know I could have at least warned the poor babysitter, but I just chickened out as usual and ran away.   

That night I was too freaked out to go back to my motel so I tried to sleep in an old car park at the edge of town instead, but every time I closed my eyes all I could see was my son's face as I walked out that door for the last time. I started to think of my wife and how much she was struggling before I left, at the time I denied it and told myself it would just pass, but I could see her get worse every day. Up until then I still saw myself as the victim, but in reality, she was. All that time thinking my wife was some sort of monster, when really, she was a hero, after all she went through, she still stood by her son and tried to do the right thing, even after she lost everything. I should have been begging for her forgiveness, not judging her. I made my decision there and then, to do whatever it took to make things right, but I knew I couldn’t do it alone.  

When I first left my family, I had no money, nowhere to stay, in a strange land, while trying to make since of what happened to my life. So, like most people in my situation, I turned to the church for guidance. I found a little church in the center of town and begged them for help, I didn’t tell the whole story, at first, I thought they would think I was crazy, so I lied and said my wife threw me out. Without question they took me in and helped me get back on my feet, but after a while I started to feel guilty for lying to them, so one day I decided to come clean to this old priest I had become close with, Pado. I think in some way I hoped he might absolve me of my sins, and I wouldn’t feel guilty anymore, but he didn’t, 

He tried to convince me to return to my family immediately, he said it was too dangerous to leave my son like that and believed the church should take him in, until my wife’s health improved of course. I don’t know why I didn’t let him help me; I suppose it was just one more thing I ran away from. 

I kept Pados number in a bible beside my bed for safe keeping, so I went back to get it, but as I was passing Bobs room, I noticed the door was open, so I went inside to check on him. There was a pool of blood on the floor and the whole place was a mess. Suddenly I realized I had made a horrible mistake; I never took into account what would happen if she found someone else in my motel room. 

I really liked Bob, he might have had problems with alcohol, and it fucked up his life, but he had a good heart and was one of the gentlest people I ever met. I knew I had to do something fast before it was too late, so I went back to my wife's motel in hopes of finding Bob. I still had a key, so I let myself in, but there was no one there and the sheet was missing from the bed, when I looked closely, I saw a bloody handprint on the corner of the mattress.  

I panicked and got out of there as fast as I could before someone saw me, unfortunately as I was walking through reception the guy behind the counter recognized me, “If you are looking for your wife sir, she left” he said in a snooty tone. 

“I’m sorry” I replied, “did she say where she was going? I never got a chance to catch up with her last night.” 

“Home of course.”  

“Did she say anything else?” 

“I am sorry sir, all she said was she got what she needed and was going home. Now if you don’t mind me saying, if you have trouble keeping track of your wife's comings and goings, maybe you should be talking to her about it.” 

I really didn’t want to go home after what happened, it still gives me nightmares to this day, but I had no choice, besides it was time to face up to my responsibilities and stop running from my problems. I knew it wouldn’t be easy seeing my son again after walking out the way I did that day, and I was sure he had some resentment towards me, even before all this happened, so I wasn’t sure what to expect. 

Before he was born everything was perfect, my wife was happy all the time and we barely fought, but not long after he came along everything changed, and my life became a living hell. At the time I was selfish and ran away, ignoring my wife's cries for help, leaving her to pick up the pieces, no wonder she cracked, I know I would have never been able to properly take care of my son on my own.   

On the long drive home, I rang Pado and told him what had happened. Thankfully he still wanted to help and tried to organize people from my local church to assist me. I spent nearly the whole drive back trying to go over everything in my head and make some sort of a plan, but by the time I got there I overthought it and wasn’t thinking straight.  

It was late when I got there, I probably should have waited for help to arrive the next day, but I had gotten myself too psyched up and I couldn’t wait any longer. I think she was expecting me because when I got to the door it was wide open, and she was sitting in the living room with my son in her arms. I must say I was relieved there was at least some sort of barrier between us, but I still kept my distance and didn’t stray far from the front door.  

It was surreal, they were both sitting there silently in the darkness, smiling, the only light was coming from a streetlight outside our living room window, my wife didn’t blink the whole time. I don’t know what kind of game they were playing, but it worked. I was terrified. I pleaded with her to stop what she was doing and let me help, but she didn’t react, she just stared right through me with a blank look on her face. For a moment I thought she was dead, until I noticed her eyes follow me as I walked over to her for a better look. I then heard the door slam and looked back to see what it was. The next thing I knew I was on the floor struggling to breathe, with my wife's hands around my neck. I tried my best to throw her off, but she was too strong for me. I thought that was it, I could feel my whole body go weak. The last thing I heard before I blacked out was my son laughing hysterically. 

I woke up in a hospital bed two days later, with no idea how I got there. When I asked the nurse, she said they found me unconscious outside the back door, after someone had made an anonymous phone call alerting them. When I tried ringing Pado, he wasn’t there, they said he had to leave suddenly, I didn’t know what to do so I tried to contact my local church, but they didn’t have a clue what I was talking about. I even tried my wife's phone, but it just rang out.

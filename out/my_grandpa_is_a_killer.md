my grandpa is a killer

Im 14 years old right now, and i love the feeling when you can read something so terrifying that it can produce adrenaline, this is the reasoni love stephen king and i joined in this community.

2 weeks ago my mom told me the story of my grandma's death. I never asked about her in my entire life, but since im 14 now and i can kinda deal with trauma, my mom told me how my grandma died (from my fathers side). In 1999 my dad was fishing, he was 24 at the time, and they lived really close to a river, so it was his hobby. My grandpa was sick and he had to live in a mental hospital 2 villages from their house. This day was a little bit different, because it was some holiday so some people from the hospital were let home for a few days, these people included my grandpa. Nobody knows what was happening in the hospital at the time. What i mean by this is that he didnt want to go back.

 As i said, my dad was fishing, so my grandma was in the garden and my grandpa was in the house. while my dad wasnt home my grandpa killed my grandma with an axe as she was coming back to the house from the garden. When my dad came back at around 11 pm, he saw my grandma laying on the stairs that lead from the garden to the house with a huge open cut on her head and a bloody axe next to her.as it turned out, my sick grandpa thought that if he kills his wife he would have to go back to the hospital. Nobody knows what was my dads reaction and what exactly did he do in that few minutes while the ambulance was on the way since he didnt talked about it to anyone (of that few minutes).

 The very next thing i know is that my dad never saw my grandpa since and he was taken to a bigger hospital 1 hour car drive from where we live and currently he lives there. After my mom told me all rhis, i couldnt have a moment of sleep for 48 hours and it still terrifyes me that after that my dad was able to live a completely normal life. I dont know what would i do if this happened to me.
Also i really like to believe that memories that cause traumas can kind of stay in the family because a normal person would probably ask about a relative if the relative has a normal death.

 Also when i first saw a picture of my grandma i had a weird feeling that something terrible happened and i always feel this feeling wben i see her in a photo. Please if someone has the same thing (having an idea about something that haopened before you were born) tell it to me, because im really interested in peoples opinions about this. Finally 500 words

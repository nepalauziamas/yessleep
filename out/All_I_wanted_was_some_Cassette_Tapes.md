So I walk into a thrift store and as I'm looking for some vintage finds I come across what looked like 2 boxes of brand new ( but slightly beaten up) Cassette tapes. And as I'm checking out one of the workers comes up and says " Hey you got the cassettes, Did you see the sealed VHS tapes" I say "no I didn't see those" so she runs and gets them. When she gets back she hands me 3 packs of unopened VHS cassettes (still have hills sticker on them if you know what that is) and says "you'll make a pretty penny flipping these on eBay" and my reply was " Flipping them I'm keeping them you can't even get used ones at a decent price any more" So she gets this strange look and says to me " Hey meet me around back" I said "what?" and she said "around back we have some cargo doors meet me there when your done checking out". So I check out and pull around back and she's standing there Holding a tote she looks at me and says" we just got a truck load of stuff from a clean out of a hoarders apartment and the guy has a ton of prerecorded VHS tapes, we can't sell them because one time we did and it said Titanic but was pornography and I can't tell you where they are But" at this point she points with her finger at one of the dumpsters in the back and says "if you don't make a mess you can have whatever you want" and hands me the tote. I said "but what do I do with this tote" and she replied "keep it" and in my head I'm like "YES FREE TOTE"

So I begin dumpster diving and I'm finding a massive amount of prerecorded VHS tapes (mostly PBS documentaries) in Girl scout cookie boxes (MMM Samoa's) so I'm just taking the boxes they are in don't wanna fill my tote too soon. That's when I start finding some strange things, one of the boxes with tapes has a notebook in it filled with writing and in another I find a science text book with all this writing on it (figured I better take that in case he discovered time travel)

All and All I leave with 108 pre recorded VHS tapes, And here is where the mystery starts.

I get them home and start transferring them out of the original boxes (don't want bugs) and I start noticing things in the bottom of the boxes, file folders & more notebooks plus newspaper clippings and photos. These notebooks are just filled with writing and the writing is written over and over then highlighted. And in one of the file folders I have his Military discharge papers and his children's birth certificates. At this point I call for back up and my Friend B comes over, I just wanted someone else to see what I was seeing and try to make some sense of it with me. So me and B are going though everything when he says " didn't you say you bought some audio cassettes when you got this stuff" and I replied "yeah but they are blank, and they were separate from this stuff " and B says "yeah but some of these VHS tapes look blank but there not, what if something is on those Cassettes" so I go and get them and sure enough they look blank but in one box they have little hand written numbers on them, in the other box they have little square masking tape with written labels.

So I pull out my cassette player and we play the tape and hear a woman talking in this ethereal creepy voice about a child drawing a picture. then we pop in another one and same woman sounds like she's being choked or coughing something up then says everything is perfect (is she trying to say she's ok or being made to say she's ok). then in yet another she says she can't go on and she can't do this any more and a man tells her she has to then she starts talking again.

it goes on and on like this for 20 cassettes most front and back, I've been posting them to YouTube and TikTok looking for answers. Every time I think I'm getting somewhere with this I find another angle, another rabbit hole. While going though the pictures in the box I uncovered strange photos? I mean who takes photos during a military briefing??? In the 50's?

Anyways here are the Facts I have

He lived in Ohio, Illinois, New York, South Carolina, Japan, and Korea

He was and Engineer in the Airforce Served in Korea, He was also a Real Estate agent, owned an Insurance agency, and an Inventor( he has a Patent)

He is in the cassette tapes, the woman refers to him by name and he asks her about "Missing Memories"

The woman in the tapes says at one time that she is an "Entity" inhabiting the body of someone named Em or M

The woman speaks of a Joan, Renee and John

In some of the tapes she appears to be dictating a book and even fight's with the person (who is not there) who is writing the book.

Some of the writings point to the "A Course In Miracles" or "ACIM" movement that some have said is a cult. ( it was also started by a guy who was involved with MKUltra)

Some of the VHS Tapes are sealed shut(I opened 2 they were just Ken Burns Civil war but why tape them shut)

In One tape she says that "M" the body she is using or her vessel as she refers to it. Is in fact now taking  the drugs and alcohol needed to allow the entity though, with less resistance. This may mean they have been forcing her to take them. What if she is an unwilling participant in this. What if these people are still out there.

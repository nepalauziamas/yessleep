Alright, take a seat, shits hit the fan while I was on vacation to that damned island. I just wish I had heeded that ‘Cursed Cave’ warning.

Since then, there’s been this thing following me. It keeps getting closer the more I try to run or resist, and I’m shit-scared of what’ll happen once it reaches me. That thing has been driving me insane. It looks human, but it isn’t. It just won’t stop smiling. I’ve even taken it to the middle of nowhere, and shot it. Nothing. Not a damned thing happened to that abomination to mankind.

Hell man, I don’t even know if it’s real, no one else seems to give a damn, and honestly, I don’t know how much longer I can hold up with that damed thing. 

Worst of all? It doesn’t say a damn thing. Never even made a sound. It isn’t human, it can’t be. You see, humans cannot, and I meant they cannot follow you everywhere, unblinking, smiling, and never making a sound. An actual human would need to sleep, eat, or even breathe, but that thing doesn’t do shit. It just follows me, getting ever so slightly closer.

Now, I’m going to go back a bit, to the day it happened. It was my, what, my third day on vacation? Not important, but I was a few days into my vacation, and saw a cave nearby. Now, I’m a trained spelunker, cave crawler, whatever the hell you call them. But I was that. So I went to go grab my gear, and ask someone if they’ll hold my rope at the entrance of the cave. God damn, I saw something vile in that cave.

It had a warning sign up, calling it the ‘Cursed Cave’, now I didn’t believe that, not one bit, I wasn’t back then and I’m still not superstitious. I could explore just about any cave. So I told the guy that was gonna hold my rope, that if I give two good tugs on it, help pull me back out, and so I set into the cave.

I got about thirty meters in, or however many feet, and saw something, that faintly looked like a person. I nearly shat myself right then and there, but I wondered if that person was real, and if so, I needed to get them out. I got maybe a few meters away, and shined my light onto them. They were just standing there, they didn’t say any words, I couldn’t hear their breathing, and they didn’t even flinch away from the sudden light. They just stood there, boring a hole into my soul, with this big ear to ear shit-eating grin.

I screamed, and I mean the blood curdling type scream. I was trying to already make my way back, yanking and climbing the rope for life, but that thing just stood there, it’s head following me up the rope, like it was keeping a target on me. 

I got out of that cave, and the guy asked what happened, and why I freaked out. I tried to tell him that I saw someone, but it wasn’t a person. He scoffed and asked if I also believed the folk tales on this island. I went to sleep that night, well, with what little sleep I could get.

When I awoke, I looked out the window, and there they were, the same unblinking, smiling, and mute creature. It was just staring at me through the window. I rushed out of bed and went towards a fairly populated area on that island, the breakfast house. But that thing managed to keep pace with me, even though I was going by bus. It managed to get to where I was, just around 20 meters away. I ran towards the breakfast house, and it managed to keep pace, but a tiny bit faster. 

No one seemed to notice either, I asked some people and pointed at the thing, but it’s like it was invisible. Everyone just shrugged it off, and asked if I was okay, or that there’s nothing there and to get a grip. 

Another thing about it and people, is that people go around it on busy streets, so it’s not like it can’t physically touch you. It can, and I think it has a physical form, I’ve just got to find out somehow. But it’s proven itself extremely hard to get close to. So I’m going to have to find alternate ways.

I’m still trying to figure out what the hell it is, I’ve even tried walking towards it, but it kept pace by walking backwards. I don’t think I’ll ever find out what that thing is, and if I do find out, I doubt I’ll be alive to tell about it.

I’m just hoping I’m able to kill it, so no one else has to go through what I have on this damned creature.

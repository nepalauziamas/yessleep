Thanks to all of your help, I have escaped, alive. As I sat in the bathroom, reading through all of your comments, I came up with a plan. First, I called the cops as silently as I could, but I guess not silent enough. When I called them I guess I made noise because she started asking me to come out and talk again, but I stayed put. Now the cops were coming in 10 minutes as I lived a little bit out of town. But my life depended on the next part of the plan, it was either die or escape alive.

I got myself prepared and opened the bathroom door. I looked to my right and there was Jane. Sorry, A Jane. She had her back turned to me which was creeping me out. She slowly turned around, her hair blocking her face. She started running to me with the knife, but I was prepared. When she got close enough I threw her as hard as I could into the bathroom, which made her hit her back on the wall, letting out a scream. "Danny!" She yelled in pain. I quickly closed the door and put a chair under the knob so she wouldn't be able to open it. Then, I sat and waited for the cops while she was screaming and hitting the door trying to get out.

When the cops arrived they knocked her unconscious. They also disposed of my wife. After I said my final goodbye. A few days later I got a call from the police department. They identified the person and it turns out that it was my ex girlfriend, Amy. To give some backstop on why I broke up with her, she use to stalk me. Alot. She would follow me when I'm hanging out with friends, and she would always make me have my location on at all times. I filed a restraining order on her but she decided to not follow it. 

After a couple days, the police department called me again saying that they had set a court date for 2 days later and asked if I wanted to come. I gladly agreed and looked forward to that all day.

When I entered the court, I had a good feeling that justice would be served, and I was spot on. 

She got life imprisonment with no possibility of parole for 25 years for the murder, 7 years for attempted murder, 3 years for violating the restraining order, 10 years for kidnapping, 4 years for assault, and 6 years for aggravated assault. After the judge finished that last sentence, I was feeling such big relief that I can't even get close to explaining it. And this was all thanks to your guys' help.

I closed reddit and went to sleep. But I woke up again facing my clock. The time read 2:56 AM, and with a feeling of deep, deep horror, I looked to my right to see Amy hovering over me. "Hello Danny."

The title makes it seem like it is a bad horror story, but this was exactly what happened.  If you want to look through my old posts, I posted this same story seven years ago in another subreddit. I  will make some changes about the details of the original story, because I was underage and i was afraid of people (parents) knowing about my history on the internet, as I thought they could see everything.    


As the original story was posted about seven years ago, my friends and I were about 15-16 years old when this incident happened. We (me and my friends) grew up on a small island near a big town in Norway. But because of the close relationship everyone had on the island, everyone knew one another. We started to smoke cigarettes, and because of our young age we had to hide it so we went into the woods every single time we wanted to smoke to not get caught.   


One day, after one suspicious neighbor started to walk around in the woods close to the road to look after the smoke scent, we started to walk further into the forest. Note that we were all familiar to the forest as it is not too large, but we were deeper into the forest nevertheless. We walked by a path, and took an old, unused path leading to an old sheep fence surrounded by a lot of trees to hide our bad habits. Where we sat and smoked, we had a lot of vision of our surroundings, so that we could run away if we ever saw someone about to bust us. Looking at the place we came from, we had the vision of the way back out of the forest, as well as noticing anyone going for a walk along the path. 180 degrees, looking into the forest, we could see an open area, a swampy-ish marsh, but there were still possibilities to walk through it in the middle.  


My friends and I had just lit up a cigarette after having this place as a save-haven four a couple of weeks when we heard someone walking in the heather (crumbly bush) at the other side of the swamp where we had vision to (into the forest). It was if like this sound lasted for a while, and when reminiscing on this, the sound of the bushes crackling seemed way to loud when considering the distance. We were all focused on the sound as we were worried about whether to run or not, so we listened. After some time, we saw someone coming out between some large trees on the other side of the marsh. As this is a place where we all know one another, we wanted to see who it was before we ran to consider if it was someone who would bust us or not. As I was looking towards the person, i noticed how the person was wearing the most noticeable neon-green pants I had ever seen. The green-neon "raincoat" was similar, although not as bright as the pants.   


When reminiscing, I would say that the place where this guy came out of was about 150 m from where we were from the other side of the swamp/marsh. I remember noticing the clothes, but when I looked at his face, it was like there was nothing there. It was just a blurry smudge. The face was just skin colored. The best way I have told about it before is if you have a bad vision (I have -3). It was like not wearing lenses but everything was clear except for his face. But there was some details about the things face, there was like a darkness or shadows where a normal person would have his/hers eyes. That is all that I remember about the the thing we saw.  


This thing came about 50 metres into the marsh area. We all noticed that it/he/she came straight towards us, walking linear through the wet areas straight towards us. We just ran straight out of the forest. When we got back to my house, we talked about who it was, and we all came to the same conclusion that the face of this neon-green man was just blurred out of reality. No one could see his face, and we all took some seconds to look at it, and we all had the same belief that this man had a blurry face. My friends and I are still friends to this day, and we can still talk about this encounter with the same amount of details that  I can describe here. Thanks for reading, it is fun to let anyone else know about this.

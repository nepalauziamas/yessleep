This happened in the summer of 2017.

My girlfriend and I are from St. Catherines, Ontario Canada.  We both attended University there and decided to take a road trip through the United States to celebrate our graduation.

Our destination was Miami, Florida.  Her family owns a condo near the beach so we had a free place to stay.

We decided to drive instead of fly because we wanted to see a bit of the country on the way down and visit a few friends.

The trip usually takes about 20 to 24 hours by car non-stop, and we were planning on making multiple stops.

The first part of the road trip was a wonderful experience.  We went shopping in Buffalo, then made our way down to Pittsburgh and managed to catch a Pirates game.

However, once we hit West Virginia, things changed.

It was nothing but endless wilderness and a few small towns sprinkled in between.

We had plans to meet up with some friends for dinner in Charlotte, North Carolina, so we wanted to get through West Virginia asap.  We only made stops when we absolutely had to.

We ended up stopping for gas at a pretty remote spot.

My girlfriend and I got out of the car.  I started pumping gas and she went inside to use the washroom and pick up some snacks.

My tank was about half full when I heard a voice behind me ask "Y'all lost?"

I looked behind me and a saw a middle aged white man with long, messy brown hair that reached down to his shoulders, and an unkept beard with dashes of greys and what looked to be drops of dried up mucus. His clothes were torn up and dirty and he smelled like a mixture of beer, sweat, pee, and feces.  He was a little overweight but pretty tall. I'm 6'0 and he was about 4 inches taller than me.  The teeth he still had left were a yellowish brown.

On his right cheek just under his eye, was a tattoo of some kind of pentagram.  I'm pretty into YouTube videos about true crime and cults, so I was able to recognize what it was pretty quickly.

He was standing very close to my face, to the point where the smell of his breath was making me dizzy, so I backed up.

"No sir, just passing through", I said nervously.

"Not too often we see tourists passing through these parts" he responded, "where ya headed?"

As he said this he moved even closer than he was before.  I had my back up against my car and I couldn't move back any further.  I wanted to get away from this guy as quickly as possible, but the car was still filling up with gas and my girlfriend was still inside the gas station.

I didn't want this dude to know where we were really going so I told him I was visiting family in Kentucky and they were expecting us.

After I said this, he cracked a weird half smile, opening his mouth just wide enough for me to get a look at his teeth again.  I'll never forget that face.  His bloodshot eyes were staring deep into my soul.  He let out a weird and sinister laugh.

"How lovely" he said, "I'll see you kids around".  Then he walked away.

I was very relieved that he walked away, but also terrified by his last remarks.  I didn't even see him when we pulled up to the gas station, so how did he know I wasn't alone?  I figured he must have been watching my girlfriend and I when we arrived.

The car was finally filled up and I saw my girlfriend walking toward the car with bags full of snacks for the road.

I noticed the weird guy was still at the gas station.  He was a few pumps away from us leaning up against an old red pick up truck, but to my utter discomfort, he wasn't alone.

There were 2 other men and one woman with him, making the group 4 in total.

The two men were just as big as he was, but they had shaved heads.  One of them was wearing a dirty white tank top and the other had no shirt on at all.

The woman was shorter, about 5'5. She was very skinny with heavy bags under her eyes and long blond hair.

They all looked like they had been living in the woods for the past 10 years.

They were staring and pointing at us, talking amongst themselves.

As soon as my girlfriend got to the car, I urgently told her to get in.

I'm usually a pretty calm guy, so when my girlfriend noticed I was kind of freaking out she knew something was up.

We quickly entered the car, I locked the doors, and I began hauling ass out of the gas station.

As we pulled around their red truck to the exit, I noticed there was another pentagram painted on the hood.  I also noticed the skull of a goat or ram on their windshield.

The 4 people began getting into their truck as they saw us leaving

I knew they were gonna follow us as soon as we left.

I explained the situation to my girlfriend as we were speeding away from the gas station.

We were zooming down the road and I looked in my rearview mirror.  As I expected, the red truck was right behind us.

I sped up even more, and they did too.  I made a left, they did too.  I made a full U turn, and they did as well.

My girlfriend managed to get reception and dialed 911.  We gave the operator our location and they gave us directions to the nearest police station.  The operator also asked for the license plate, but the truck didn't have any.

Once we were off the phone with them, my girlfriend stuck her cell phone outside of the window and started pointing to it, letting the creeps know we called the police.

They finally got the message and stopped following us.

We arrived to the police station and filed a report.  We gave them the description of the truck and suspects. The investigator said they would call us if they had any more information.

We were extremely shaken but also relived.  All we wanted to do at that point was get the hell out of West Virginia.

We thought we had shaken the group for good, but unfortunately, we were wrong...

We decided to drive through the night to cover as much ground as possible.

The area of Appalachia we were in had no street lights, and I could only see what my headlights allowed me to see.

Everything was fine until I noticed 2 headlights in my rearview mirror.

At first I didn't think anything of it, but I kept an eye on them.

The headlights got closer and closer until they they were tailgating us.

To my complete shock and horror, it was the same red truck from the gas station.  These people had somehow found us again, and were right behind us.

"Its them!" I yelled.

My girlfriend began to freak out and dialed 911.

I floored the gas pedal, not even knowing what was 10 meters in front of me.  All we cared about was escaping.

We got a mile up the road until my girlfriend yelled "watch out!".

There were 3 dead cows blocking the narrow road.  I slammed on the breaks.

The red truck was right behind us and we couldn't go forward, we knew we fell into a trap.

All of the sudden, a naked man wearing a goat mask darted from out of the woods and began hitting our car with what looked like a large axe.

The naked man got on the hood of our car, and started making sheep noises.

My girlfriend was still on the phone with 911 but all she could do was scream.

The people behind us got out of the red truck and began walking toward our car.  Two of them had rifles and one of them had a large machete.

I knew what I had to do.  I put the car into reverse and floored it.

The naked man fell off our car. We smashed into the truck and I managed to knock it into a ditch.

After the truck was out of the way, I pulled the fastest U turn of my life and we got out of there.

The people were yelling all kinds of obscenities at us as we drove away.

I drove as fast as I could away from these people until we finally arrived in a town, and filed another police report.

My girlfriend and I were uninjured thankfully, but we were extremely traumatized.

The car was still drivable after that, so we were able to get the fuck out of West Virginia the next morning.

This entire experience made my girlfriend and I scared to do any more road trips.

I still call the local police department in West Virginia once in a while to see if they have any leads on these people, but so far they have not found anything.

The fact that these people were able to find us after we went to the police station and drove far away still scares and baffles me to this day.

Who knows what kind of sick and twisted things this cult had planned if they managed to catch us.

Stay safe out there, everyone.

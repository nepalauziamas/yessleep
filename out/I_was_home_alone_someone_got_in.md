I was sitting on the couch playing my Xbox and drinking my bottle of soda, having the best time of my life. Your probably wondering what I'm going on about but I was home alone for the first time. I was 14 , and your probably thinking I'm weird at 14 being excited for being home alone.

But my mom was overprotective of me and brought me everywhere with them. My dad was finally able to get my mother out of the house on a date, which means I was able to be home alone for the first time. I then heard a knock on the door, must of been the pizza guy my dad had called for me.

I grabbed the $20 my dad left and opened the door thinking it would be the pizza guy. But instead I saw a man wearing a black hoodie, ripped jeans, and dirty beard. "Um, you need something sir?" He smiled and finally spoke "I-I'm wondering if I could use your phone. Please I really need too use it", I didn't know what to say to this man.

He was making me uncomfortable and I didn't trust this guy at all. "Sorry sir, my parents aren't home and I'm not aloud to have strangers in the house" looking back that was the dumbest thing I could of said. I should of just lied and said they were home but I was so creeped out by this guy and wanted him gone.

His smile faded away and he said "Okay then kid gets all be going now". He then left And I slammed the door shut, happy it was over and he was gone. 

I went back to playing my Xbox, but after awhile I started to get hungry. I wondered why the pizza hasn't shown up yet. I decided to make myself a sandwich while I waited for the pizza to arrive, but when I went to grab the bread I heard glass shatter. I froze in fear not knowing what to do, I eventually decided to check it out.

It came from the back door and it had a hole smashed through the glass of the door. A arm was coming through trying to grab the door handle to open the door. I couldn't get a good look of the person, so I screamed at them to leave. The person started to laugh, so I ran away to grab a phone and call for help.

I grabbed the phone and slammed in 911 and waited for the operator to pick up, and when they finally picked up I was panicking and told them everything that was going on that I almost forgot to breath. The operator called me down and told me to find somewhere to hide, I ran to my room and locked the door.

The operator asked if I had a weapon, I looked around and found a baseball bat so I grabbed it. Knowing if he got in, I would have to use it to defend myself. I then heard the man start "Come out kid, I want to play" I was shitting myself at this point, I just wanted to be with my parents right now the one time I'm left home alone this happens.

I heard the person slamming and breaking things trying to find me he even started screaming. I wanted to cry at this point until I heard his footsteps getting closer and closer to my door. I saw the doorknob move and he started to scream when it wouldn't open, then he  started to slam on the door. "Let me in you son of a bitch!" I held my bat up ready to defend myself.

He started slamming on the door I dropped the phone on the ground, I was sweating heavily until he finally broke the door down. "Please, just take whatever you want". He started to get closer to me and when he did he pulled a bloody knife out of his pocket. "Please-please, just leave me be". He started to laugh menacingly.

He held the knife up ready to stab me, and I knew what to do and swung the bat. I ended up hitting him in the head, he dropped to the ground and I just kept beating him over and over. And when I finally stopped blood was all over his face and on the end of the bat. 

I didn't even notice the sirens outside when the police came in I ran out to them crying. They ended up taking the man away, they also found out he murdered the pizza man and that's why he didn't show up. That's why there was blood on the knife, knowing I was that close to death terrifies me. And I don't think I'll ever be home alone again.

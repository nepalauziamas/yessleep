I am so annoyed. It happens all of the time. It's happened since I was young. It happens now. It only happens when I'm alone. I'll be walking along and it feels like someone is walking with me and theres no one there. I stop and look around and see just a glimpse of black dart away from. I try to write it off as my imagination. Yeah. It's gotta be. There's no such thing as ghosts. I'll stand in front of a mirror and it feels like it's watching me. I turn to look and it looks like something runs away but I never see an actual person or animal just what could be described as a grey tint in the air. Like in the wile e coyote cartoons when the road runner speeds off. I'll stand in a room for a second and it feels like a hand is on my shoulder. I turn around. Nothing. Sometimes it sounds like there are footsteps. I must be imagining it. I will be sitting in a waiting room and it just feels like someone is sitting in the chair next to me. Like I said this has happened since I was a child. I'll be walking on the street and it feels like someone is watching me. Analyzing my every move but when I turn around, nothing. Sometimes it feels like someone is right next to me and out of the corner of my eye I can see the grey run past. I'll be in bed and it feels like someone is sleeping next to me. No one is there. But just before I look over the grey (just gonna refer to as that because I always have) jets away. I've told my therapist about this. She thinks that it may be just a trick or the eyes and I may just need my glasses adjusted. I've always had bad eye sight. Sometimes if I stare too long into an empty space, it looks like someone is sitting in front of me. Almost like it may have a black outline. Sometimes if I'm sitting down and I'm wearing something hooded, I'll feel a slight tug. These instances have happened I've written it off as just an illusion. I see it dart past me alot, almost like it's scared of being seen or noticed. I'll be in a place alone, but I never feel alone. It gets irritating because even though I should be used to it, it makes me jump all of the time. Sometimes, I'll be sitting in my living room and I'll see the curtain lift a bit. Like the wind blew on it in just the slightest, but then I remember, the windows are closed and the wind wouldn't blow in the inside. There are times I just get so scared to be alone. Because I never ever feel alone. When I was a child, I was left home alot but even then I never felt alone. I'll be standing somewhere, I'll hear my name but when I look or ask someone if they said my name, everybody says they do not. Sometimes, I can almost swear there are indentations on the seats that are located in my peripheral vision. Why can't I just ever be alone?

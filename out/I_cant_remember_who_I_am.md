 

I don’t remember who I am.

All I know is that I am alive… I feel alive.

7:45 AM: It comes and goes in waves.

7:51 AM: Sometimes I am here, and sometimes I am there.

Sometimes… I am nowhere. It’s pitch black in he.

I don’t know where I am or where I’ve been.

7:56 AM: It’s hard to th.

7:58 AM: It’s like I’m stuck in my mind. Why is it so hard to think? WHY?

8:00 AM: I should probably tune out and watch some relaxing television.

11:00 AM: I don’t remember what I was watching. I just started walking around the house. I don’t know where I am going. What am I supposed to do again?

12:00PM: Some nice man gave me a water bottle. No, it’s juice. It helps me breathe when I drink it.

It made me feel alive. Like I’m back in my body. 

12:05 PM: I am alive.

12:16 PM: I am here aga.

12:27 PM: No, I’ve always been here.

12:34 PM: I can’t feel my body.. There’s that wave again.

2:34 PM: I am alive for the first time.

2:41 PM: I am perfectly awa.

2:45 PM: No sense in thinking I am going to go for a walk and maybe some coffee to make myself feel alive. 

3:00 PM: That was a lovely cup of coffee and a delightful walk. I feel awake.

3:05 PM: I don’t feel like myself. I feel jittery. I drank some coffee?

4:00 PM: I keep disappearing from my body. But this nice woman keeps reminding me I’m alive. I appreciate her company.

4:35 PM: I was in that dark place again. I don’t remember.

4:37 PM: I am alive, right?

5:00 PM: I am awake for the first time.

5:15 PM: that was some lovely water.

5:36 PM: Where am I? Why am I writing this down?

6:00 PM: My eyesight works. I am alive.

6:15 PM: Every time I blink, I see an unfamiliar landscape. 

Every time I blink, I can’t recognize where I am or where I’ve been. My eyes can’t remember. my mind cant remember. 

7:00 PM: I feel like I am in torment. 

7:15 PM: I am awa, I am here she says.

7:30 PM: The man gives me some food. It tastes pretty good. 

7:45 PM: I think I like to eat. 

8:00 PM: The man is asking me questions I don’t understand, but tells me to write the answers. 

no, yes, no, yes, yes, I don’t know, maybe, I don’t remember, it’s hard to remember, I feel awake, I feel alive for now. 

9:00 PM: The man is telling me to go to sleep, but I don’t want to sleep. I always sleep. I feel like I am only awake for moments at a time. Right now, I am very alive. 

I don’t want to sleep. I want to stay awake.

I don’t want to sleep. I want to stay awake.

I don’t want to sleep. I want to stay awake.

I don’t want to sleep. I want to stay awake.

Let me stay awa

This is one of my patient’s journals who is currently suffering from amnesia. As you may have read, he likes to walk and drink coffee. When he was younger, he hiked hills, mountains and was a pretty athletic man. His wife deeply cares for him and makes sure that he is by his side at most times. However, despite the loving care and affection he receives, there are still times where he knows something is very wrong. And as you can tell, he does not take this lightly and panics. If you see a man who seems to be lost out in the street shouting how alive and awake he is.

I run a private campground.  Over the past… year and a half? I’ve been telling you all about the [various problems](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mtt6ty/how_to_survive_camping_i_may_have_an_anger_problem/) I have to take care of.  I’m pretty certain I’ve mentioned in the past how my family is often called upon to deal with problems outside the campground as well.  This isn’t terribly common, as my campground tends to swallow up any inhuman things that appear in the general vicinity.  This has created a bit of a skewed image of my campground, in that it is far more dangerous than other campgrounds or locations one might visit.

This is simply not true.  The forest has never been kind to humanity.

Trust me.  These things are everywhere.

The current sheriff got a call about a murder investigation.  It wasn’t in her county, but she had contact with some people there and they knew she had experience with inhuman things.  So when the investigation looked like it was turning into an unsolved case because the reality they understood simply did not fit with what happened, they gave the sheriff a call.  And the sheriff called the old sheriff.  And the old sheriff called me.

“This is *literally* four hours away,” I said, after looking up directions for where he wanted to go.

“Which is why I need you to drive,” he replied.  “Leg is bothering me.”

“Can’t your wife take you?”

He replied that it was complicated, which means that some weird inhuman restrictions are in play.  Then he added that he had a feeling that they’d need more help than just consulting.  I certainly wasn’t going to let him go alone after hearing that, so early in the morning I was showing up at his house to pick him up.  His wife was kind enough to make us waffles before we left, at least.

She also packed us lunches.  I haven’t had anyone pack me lunch in a long time.  Then we headed out the door.  The sheriff was limping visibly.

“Don’t worry about insurance,” his wife said as she kissed him goodbye at the front door.  “I’ll take care of it.”

He only grunted in reply.  I asked him what she meant, once we reached my car.

“It’s about the leg,” he explained.  “I think it’s not fitting right, but it’s going to be expensive to get it fixed.  Insurance won’t cover it.”

“Of course they won’t,” I muttered.

I’m sure she would indeed get it handled, one way or another.  Her people can lay down some pretty epic curses when they want to.  I almost felt bad for whatever insurance company he gets his coverage from.  *Almost*.

Okay, if I’m really being honest I don’t feel bad for them at all.

During the drive I took the opportunity to ask him about his wife.  I’m sure a bunch of you are excited for more details on what she is, but I *can’t*.  I really really can’t.  That’s the rule of these things - you don’t talk about what they are.  And let me tell you, the consequences of breaking that stipulation are *bad*.  Like massive collateral damage bad.  I know that some of you have figured it out and that’s fine, but since I know her personally I don’t think it’s safe for me to come right out and say it.

I do think it’s okay if I tell you how the two of them met.  I asked the sheriff if it’d be safe to share this story and he didn’t think there would be an issue.  She’d never said he couldn’t, after all.

Also we called her and asked first, just to make sure.

The old sheriff’s first wife died of cancer.  It was one of the kinds that is often found only when it’s too late.  She went into hospice and a few months later she died.

The sheriff was by himself just long enough to grow lonely.  One day he returned home from work to find a strange woman in his house.  He was wary, but not yet alarmed.  See, his wife and him had a tradition.  They took turns cooking dinner, except on Friday.  On Friday, they cooked together.  And when he walked into his house, thinking he’d just order another pizza this week, he found her waiting in the kitchen with ingredients ready to be prepped.  They cooked together without speaking and it felt like the most natural thing in the world.

He started introducing her as his wife the very next day.  They were never officially married.  What would he put on the marriage license?  As far as our society is concerned, she doesn’t exist.  He still files his taxes singly.  I guess even her kind don’t want to hassle with the IRS.

The rest of the town just fell in line with it.  People figured out pretty quick what was going on.  I was in my freshman year of college when this all happened and I came home for the summer and my dad was like, oh yeah, the sheriff remarried.  That was it.  I figured the rest out on my own after I took over the campground.

When the old sheriff was taken by the vanishing house, his wife stuck around.  I think the town knew what that meant.  He was still alive.  We just… didn’t talk about it.  Didn’t do anything about it.  That’s how it is.  The people that the inhuman world claims are gone for us, forever.  We mourn them.  We move on.  And if something incredible happens - if someone goes into the house and slays a wanna-be god - then it’s an outlier.  It’s certainly not something anyone holds out *hope* for.

I wonder if it’s easier for us, when we lose someone.  There’s no uncertainty.  There’s no wondering if a loved one will ever turn up someday.  They’re gone.  We don’t have missing persons cases in this town.  We might not know the specifics of what happened to them, but we know the gist of it.

The world is a very dangerous place, after all.

The county we were traveling to had someone vanish.  It was a young man that had recently returned home after dropping out of college.  He was having a hard time, his mother said, and left the house late at night without taking his car.  When he wasn’t back by morning, the mother called the police to report him missing.  And then she sat at home and hoped.  Hoped for days.

Then the police found the body and that hope of finding him again became the hope of finding his killer and bringing them to justice.  But that, too, is a futile hope.  For judging by the state of the body, his killer is nothing that could be brought before a mortal court.

The old sheriff had all the police records, including photographs.  I’d looked them over the day prior.  The man had been beaten to death.  Every bone in his body was broken - literally.  Forensics had come up completely empty.  The ground was soft, but there were no footprints.  There was evidence of a struggle, but the man might have well been fighting against thin air for everything they found.

“Know what this reminds me of?” the old sheriff asked.

“What?”

He absently tapped the folder sitting on his lap.  I did not look away from the road.

“[The hitchhikers](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/jzbsf9/how_to_survive_camping_the_hitchhikers/).”

“Is this something personal for you?” I asked cautiously.

“Maybe.”

It was.  I told him that there was no guarantee that the rule of three still applied.  He’d battled the creature twice and the third time was when he could slay it for good.  It’d been years, though.  He’d spent time locked inside the vanishing house in the interim.  Hell, we weren’t even in the same county where it started anymore.  We’d get out there and confirm it was the hitchhiker and tell the local police force how to deal with it.  Then we’d go home.

“Sure,” the old sheriff replied.

Which I’m sure you all realize was his way of saying, ‘I do what I want and what I want is to put a bullet in the head of that inhuman asshole.’

I let the old sheriff liaison with the local police force when we got there.  He knew the lingo.  I stayed by the car and hate-read bad takes on Twitter.  Look.  It passes the time.  Eventually the old sheriff returned, having mostly confirmed our fears.  It’s difficult to identify these inhuman things with much certainty, as all we have to go on most of the time are literal fairytales.  But the old sheriff said that the mother reported that her son was prone to hitchhiking when he felt like it and that they had some other people that went missing that might have been doing the same thing.  They’d been spaced out enough and in wildly different locations across the county that they hadn’t thought it was connected.  Also, it’s hard to confirm that someone hitchhiking was truly missing and hadn’t just… left.

“Let’s go to where they found the body,” the old sheriff suggested.

“You aren’t just trying to get a crack at this creature again, are you?” I asked.

He grunted.  Which obviously means yes.  I sighed dramatically and got back in the car.  I couldn’t blame him.  If it were me, I probably would have done the exact same thing.  Heck, I didn’t protest that much, after all.  Maybe I wanted a shot at this creature too.  After all, we knew how to beat it.  Get a hold of the potion it carried that made you super strong and then smash its skull in.

Eventually the old sheriff told me to pull over.  I wasn’t certain how he knew we were at the spot the body was found, because it all looked like a narrow road with trees on either side to me.  There were no distinguishing features.  Honestly, I think he was just picking a random spot that looked isolated enough in the hopes that the creature came by.  He certainly didn’t seem to be doing anything significant as he poked about, kicking at the leaves awkwardly with his prosthetic leg.  I felt bad for him.  It did seem to be uncomfortable.  I was about to suggest we go find a nice park to eat the lunches that his wife packed for us when I heard a car approaching on the road.

It might not be anything, I told myself, heart hammering.  We both stood there, side-by-side, watching it approach.  Might just be a person.

The car slowed down.  My heart sank.  And then it stopped beside us and the window rolled down and I saw a man’s face protruding from a mass of overgrown hair.

“Need a ride?” the man asked, leaning his head out the window.

His beard tumbled free, overflowing over the side of the car and spilling onto the ground.  It unrolled all the way to where we stood, puddling at our feet and forming a face that smiled at us as he spoke.

He didn’t give us a chance to reply.

“Of course you do,” he said cheerfully.

And… I hesitate to admit this… but we were kidnapped by his beard.

It parted neatly in two, spiraling around itself to form two ropes of hair.  They whipped around my knees and jerked, pulling me off my feet and lifting me bodily into the air.  I grasped desperately for my knife on instinct, but those assholes the harvesters haven’t returned it yet, so my fingers closed on empty air.  Then I was thrown through an open car window and into the backseat, narrowly avoiding striking my head against the frame, and I slammed into the old sheriff, who had just been tossed neatly through the opposite window.

And the car took off.  The tires squealed as the driver accelerated, cackling madly.  I couldn’t see out the front window for all the hair.  My heart was pounding, for I knew what would happen now.  It wasn’t guaranteed I’d survive the car wreck.  I wasn’t his intended victim, after all.  I just happened to be standing nearby.

“Can you,” I said in an undertone, settling myself uneasily on the car seat, “shoot him?”

“His beard took my gun,” the old sheriff replied ruefully.  “I’m not sure where it is.”

“So we’re doing this the hard way,” I sighed.

“Yep.”

And the old sheriff stared straight ahead at where the driver’s skull should be and cracked his knuckles.

Things turned out just as the old sheriff described in previous encounters.  The creature threw the wheel to the side before we had a chance to come up with another plan, flipping the car violently off the road.  I think I didn’t die because the creature didn’t *want* me to die in the crash.  It wanted to kill us with its own hands.  I’m not sure what happened though, as it turns out I still have some trauma left from the last time I was in a car that rolled.  I froze up.  It was like my brain just… turned itself off.  I don’t recall anything of the car flipping.  I just remember a brief sensation of weightlessness and then I was on the ground, free of the car, and there was an incredibly hairy man beating the life out of the old sheriff.

I couldn’t see him for all the hair.  It cascaded off the creature’s head like a lion’s mane.  His beard was strewn across the ground.  I couldn’t see, but I could *hear* the blows, and the old sheriff’s muted grunts of pain.

I staggered to my feet.  I was dazed, but adrenaline was surging through my veins and I felt no pain.  I took a step forward and the hair around my feet twitched and then rose to life.  It whipped around me like a tornado.  I felt a sting from where it sliced my cheek and when I raised my arms to protect my face, it snapped around my wrist and pulled tight.

And then I heard the old sheriff cry out in pain - and my anger came flooding in.

I remember when my parents died in perfect clarity.  I wasn’t there, but I dreamed of what happened.  I remember waking in my apartment, miles and miles and miles from home, bathed in sweat.  My bedsheets were twisted around me and my face was wet with tears.  In my dream I saw my dad, storming out the front door, dragging the little girl by her hair.  I told myself it was just a nightmare as I dialed my parent’s phone number, over and over, growing increasingly more frantic as no one answered.

I’ve never felt so helpless in my life.

Now here I was, listening to the old sheriff fighting for his life in front of me.

I screamed in rage.  I yanked my wrist back, pulling the hair that held me tight.  And then I *bit* it in two.  My teeth clenched down on the bristles and I ripped and I tore and shredded it until I was free.  I wrapped my hand around the hair floating in the air around me, twisting it through my fingers and turning it over and over like winding up a rope and I *pulled* with all my strength.

The creature’s head snapped back.  I still couldn’t see its face, but I saw its posture shift underneath all those layers of hair.

The old sheriff called my name.  I looked up in time to see something sailing through the air, flying over top of the creature’s head.

It was the old sheriff’s leg.  He had tossed me his prosthetic leg.

And I caught it, gripped it by the ankle like a club, and brought it down with all my strength on top of where I hoped the creature’s skull was.

My blow connected with something solid.  There was a second of resistance, then there was a crack like a branch snapping, and then it yielded and my swing continued on for a few more inches.  Like driving it through pudding.

All around us, the hair stopped moving.  It went limp, floating gently to the ground to lay in whorls and loops.  The old sheriff picked himself up as best as he could.  He got himself into a sitting position, panting hard.  His face was puffy and bruised and I was certain his torso was similarly battered, but otherwise he didn’t seem to be seriously injured.

“I think,” he panted, “the rule of three still applies.”

It was dead.  We hadn’t killed it in the way we’d expected to, but it *was* dead and that’s all that matters, in the end.

The old sheriff’s leg was broken beyond repair.  I’d bent the metal bar when I drove it through the creature’s skull.  Neither of us wanted to involve the local police further - they might still be trying to make sense of this in mundane terms - so I walked by myself back to where my car had been left by the side of the road.  Then I picked up the old sheriff and threw the creature’s body into the trunk.  It took some work to make sure none of the hair was hanging out.

The old sheriff called the local police to let them know the problem was dealt with.  The creature wouldn’t come back, he said.  He didn’t give them other details than that.  Let them think a banishing ritual did the trick or something else that is nice and safe for our modern sensibilities.  Not that I bashed something’s skull in and threw the body in the back of my car.

We burned it when we got home.  Let me tell you - the smell of *that much* hair burning is… something.

And while we watched the bonfire, the old sheriff asked me about Beau, of all things.  If he’d been around recently.  I was baffled as to why he’d bring this up now.  And then...

“You hate him, don’t you?” he asked.

I was quiet for a bit.  How do I explain this?  How do I *reconcile* this to all of you?  To myself?  I do hate these inhuman things.  I’ve dealt with them for so long and I’ve seen the damage they can do.  But what’s more, I almost *have* to hate them.  It’s our instinct to humanize things, to make them like us.  We project ourselves onto everything we interact with because we are social creatures and we want to bring others into our circle of humanity.  These inhuman things have exploited that.  Why else do they take on human form so often?

So I hate them.  I hate them to circumvent that human weakness.

“Why are you asking about him?” I asked, stalling for time.

“I’m worried about you.”

“It’s fine.  He’s still willing to help me… sometimes.”

“But you *do* hate him.”

I fumbled for words.  I guess… if you want to get really pedantic about it, sure.  There’s… revulsion there.  It’s buried deep.  I don’t know if I could get rid of it.  I keep thinking of him as human because it’s *easier* that way and then he reminds me that he’s not and something flickers inside me.  A spark.  That’s all.  Just a spark and I hastily bury it.  It’s not like it actually impacts our relationship.

“It’s fine,” I said hastily.  “It’s just a gut reaction.  I’m managing.”

“Kate… I saw the look on your face, when you were standing over the body of that thing.”

“Do you blame me?” I asked softly.

“Of course not.  I hate them too.  But don’t let that hatred drive away *everyone* that could help you, human or not.”

He stood, leaning heavily on a crutch I’d fetched from the campground medical supplies.  His wife was driving along the road towards us to give him a ride home.

“I like being alone,” I said.

“I know.  I’m not saying you have to *marry* him or anything, I understand that’s not really your thing.  But you need some people on your side.”

At one point the old sheriff had told me to consider killing Beau.  That was before the battle with the fomorian.  Before Bryan and the dogs left.  The old sheriff wasn’t blinded by idealism.  He was willing to tolerate a necessary evil.  He worked with my family, after all.

“I don’t want anything to happen to him.”  I spoke very softly.  “I’m scared just thinking about it.”

“That doesn’t mean you can’t still hate him for what he is.  You need to be careful.”

His wife stopped the car beside us.  She stuck her head out the driver’s side window.

“Good news!” she announced cheerily.  “Insurance is willing to pay for a whole new leg.  We’ll go get it fitted tomorrow.”

I wasn’t even surprised by this.

I’m a campground manager.  I’ve spent my life trying to keep these inhuman things under control.  I’ve lost friends, staff, and family to them.  I’ve been threatened, hurt, and been in fear for my life innumerable times.  Is it any wonder, then, that I would hate them?  That I would resent these creatures that exist only to prey upon us?

I hate being helpless against them.  I hate my frailty.  I hate not being able to do anything about it.

We got lucky this time.  Perhaps the symbolic sacrifice was enough to make the potion unnecessary.  Perhaps his wife knew and did something to his leg in advance.  Whatever the reason, we got lucky, and human strength was enough.

It might not be enough next time.  Or the time after.  It so often isn’t.

I’ll continue to use whatever weapons I have at my disposal.  But it doesn’t mean I won’t despise them in the deepest parts of my heart.  I hate that I’m forced to work with the harvesters.  I hate that I’m forced to rely on Beau.

And I think I might even hate myself, for being willing to make these compromises. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

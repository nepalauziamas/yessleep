Lia Henderson is the name of a young lady. She is bullied at school because she is described as "ugly and a nerd," despite the fact that she is clearly a regular British girl. She was born on May 4th, 2005 in England. She despised being bullied by her obnoxious peers on a daily basis. Her best friend Mia accidentally sent a text message to her mother one day, and her mother saw it right away. She saw what they'd done to her when she watched the tape. Lia noticed her mother taking her out of school in the afternoon and began collecting her belongings to relocate to America. She was heartbroken and saddened by the fact that her best and only buddy would soon be gone.

Lia finished packing and cleaning the house for the move a few days later. Lia tearfully bid her goodbyes to her residence and climbed in the car once her mother arrived with the movers. Her mother drove them to the airport, where they boarded the plane. "Mom, I don't want to move-", she said. "Oh, come on, it'll be fantastic! Don't be concerned", her mother uttered.

She adored her house in America since it was so spacious and tastefully decorated. Lia's uniform was brought to her by her mother while she went food shopping. Lia enjoyed it, but she was apprehensive. It was her first day of secondary school on Monday. It was enormous, with two playgrounds, a large field, and a large café. Mrs. Chang Lee was her instructor, and she was so sweet that she told a boy to give Lia a tour of the school.

"Nice to meet you, Leo," he said as he introduced himself. He extends his hand gracefully. These two enjoyed a close friendship for over a year, and they recently celebrated their one-year anniversary. They made the decision to go on a road trip. When Leo arrived at Lia's place, he leapt on the bed while she was showering and smashed something under the blanket. He slowly raised it to reveal a... diary. He was taken aback when he opened it! He discovered that she had liked him from the moment they met. He didn't like her, so he hurried back to his house and wrote Lia a letter. She reads it and sobs as she discovers he doesn't like her and only wants to be friends with her. She agrees, and they’re friendship starts again…

But, for the first time, things take a turn for the worst, as he has less time for her. He then introduced her to his new girlfriend one day, and she was astonished and devastated, yet delighted for him. She fled to the bathroom and started crying after they got to know each other. His girlfriend arrived and calmed her down. Lia told her everything; she was sad for her, but she refused to allow anything happen to her. She tried everything she could to find her a caring, sweet boyfriend, but it didn't work out. They had a sleepover, and Leo drank too much beer and vodka, becoming inebriated, and doing something that should never have happened.

He was too inebriated to recognise what he had done when he pulled out a knife and stabbed his girlfriend and Lia. He begged for aid at her mother's house, but she manipulated him and contacted the cops, who arrested him for the murders of Lia Henderson and Siane Gravestone. He was given a life sentence, but his actions are still remembered.

"It’s been two years since the killings of Siane Gravestone and Lia Henderson," says Lia's mother before turning off the television and preparing lunch for her two young children. Without Lia, it's been difficult for two years, and her mother, who recently gave birth to twins, is under stress.

The twins' pasta with meatballs is prepared by Maria (Lia's mother). When the front door unexpectedly knocks as she is preparing the sauce, she checks and sees Lia's ghost. She yells until the Amazon delivery man calms her down, and after accepting the item, she eats before going to bed.

Maria has been experiencing flashbacks and has been seeing images of Lia; she is so afraid that she visits her private psychologist, who soothes Maria and assures her that everything will be okay.

She leaves her haunting home and relocates to Mexico. She abruptly vanished out of nowhere, so people started looking into what occurred. But Lia's spirit is still stalking her every day, and she has no idea how to survive.

Maria receives a text message from an unknown number a couple years after moving to Mexico. "Hello Maria," it read. "Observe me? I'm Siane, the victim who was killed with your daughter. At Lia's favourite park, meet me at midnight."

"How is she alive?", she wondered while feeling terrified. The clock next to her struck twelve as she then packed a knife as a security measure. She hurried to the park and was startled to discover....

As she approaches the park, she notices Siane standing in Lia's favourite spot. "Oh why did you come early, I didn't anticipate you at this time," Siane adds. It was 11:45 p.m., and Maria questioned why she wanted her here and how she remained alive… 

She tells her the backstory to everything. "You see, I was Leo's ex, and I didn't appreciate him hanging out with your daughter. No! Having fun with him! I wanted revenge. I paid Leo $500 USD to assist me in murdering your daughter. We had a tremendous plan, and everything was going swimmingly until you phoned the cops! Hahaha, I drank the poison next to the pipe. It was all your fault, thank you. Since you're never going to catch me because I'm leaving for L.A. I believe I'll see you shortly."

"And you murdered your own daughter, Ms. Rodriguez." Maria is stunned and faints on the spot as she walks away.

My old college roommate, Dylan, lives just outside of Denver. Like most Colorado natives, he loves to camp. The crazy kind of camper who does it all year, even in December.


Whenever he goes to the mountains alone, I have him check in with me just in case.

I’m worried about him, so I’ll get right to it. 

His texts are starting to scare me.




The following is our latest text conversation:




2:30 PM

Dylan: Yo, I just parked my car, heading to the trail now.


Me: You’re crazy man, how cold is it?


Dylan: Not bad actually. 30s. You gotta come out here soon. It’s beautiful. 


Me: Ha! We’ll see in Spring when it warms up. Have fun man. Watch out for staircases in the forest!

Dylan: Nice dude. Real funny.





7:44 AM


Dylan: Dude... r u up?

Me: Yessir, you okay?


Dylan: This is so weird. I woke up this morning, and there’s someone else out here?


Me: On the mountain? Looks like you’re not the only Winter camper lol. 


Dylan: No… Not a camper. I can see them on the horizon, but they haven’t moved. Like at all. 


Me: What?


Dylan: idk it definitely looks like a person but, they haven’t moved. They’re probably 300 yards away. But standing completely still.


Me: That’s super creepy dude. Keep me updated.






9:19 AM

Dylan: They still haven’t moved. I made breakfast over the fire and acted like I didn’t notice anything. Im gonna check it out.


Me: Ight lemme know. Maybe it’s a stump or something?






9:33AM


Dylan: Dude...

Dylan: It’s a fucking scarecrow.

Me: What? Like a farmers scarecrow?


Dylan: Ya man, wtf other kinda scarecrows are there? Its clothes are weird though.

Me: How so?


Dylan: The clothes are modern. Its wearing a nice black jacket and jeans and stuff. Face is kinda scary. Burlap sack with black eyes and a huge smile stitched on. 
Why is this thing out here? I’m tempted to steal its North Face jacket lol.

Dylan: I posted a pic of it on my snap story if you want to see what it looks like. 


Me: Idk dude I’d leave it alone. Maybe it’s some sort of conservation study or something? Like to see if bears will attack it? You might be on camera. And I know you have weed  and shrooms on you...


Dylan: Ha! Good point. Speaking of which, time to pack a bowl lol.


Me: Have fun! Haha









3:33 AM

Dylan: Someone is outside my tent.

Me: I’m sure.

Dylan:  Dude please this is serious. I can see their shadow.


Me: Call the police Dylan!!!


Dylan: No! I don’t want to make any noise. They probably think I’m asleep. I have my knife. I’m texting inside my sleeping bag so they can’t see my phone light. 

Dylan: I thought I heard a noise and I woke up. I guess I didn’t zip up my tent all the way, and I assumed it was the wind. But then I saw the silhouette.

Me: Wtf man should I call the police for you?!?! Where are you? Latitude and Longitude now!

Me: Dylan!!!!??? Dude please respond and drop a pin so I know where you are.







6:56 AM

Dylan: I'm alright.


Me: Thanks for finally responding!!! I just about had a heart attack. Barely slept. I was going to call the police or ranger station but idk where you’re at. 


Dylan: There’s something weird though...the scarecrow is right outside my tent. Someone put it there last night while I was asleep. That’s the shadow I saw. I don’t like this at all.


Me: Go home man. Seriously. That’s messed up even if it’s a joke.


Dylan: I’m about 4 miles from my car. I’ll text you when I get back to it.

Dylan: Also, I forgot to mention something.

Me: What?

Dylan: My hat was on top of the scarecrow this morning... someone must have got into my tent last night while I was asleep, and put my hat on its head… 



Me: Text me ASAP!!!






(That was earlier. Hopefully he gets back okay.)


(Three dots... it looks like he is responding.)





9:13 AM

Dylan: Oh shit....Someone slashed my tires... and there’s another scarecrow by my car.

I like to hang glide, it's been a hobby of mine for 11 years now, I started off dune boogin in nagshead n.c where I learned to control myself and hover on strong wind. My father and I built my first one when I lived at the beach, we used some locally sourced bamboo a few pins and a blue tarp, it wasn't perfect but she sure did get airtime. Ever since that  day I fell in love with the idea of flying through the sky's and ripping my way past the scenery in a graceful flight. I built my first actual hanglider that had proper materials at 17, I used 6061 aluminum got the right safety stuff, got a cocoon, bought and stitched my own Dacron for my wing and set off, it was the best, but after a while I knew I wanted to buy one that could take me to even greater heights,

That takes me to now! I have officially purchased a falcon and am about to take it on a test flight to crowders mountain in north Carolina if everything goes to plan I could easily get over 30 miles from my starting point, I have taken this path before albeit not directly but very similar. I hiked the 3 mile path up mountain climbed up to the top and set sail into the wind, it isn't the highest mountain around but I know it well and it gives great lift. I finally made it to my starting point after a 2 and a half hour walk/climb, I was a bit tired so I sat down on the bright gray rocks and let the sunlight embrace me taking shallow sips of my coolaid before hand.

I sat there for about 35 minutes, I took a few more swigs of my coolaid and put it back in my backpack. I had also eaten some pb crackers for the protein, I set up my glider and by the time I was ready to leave it was about 5 pm. It was late summer so I didnt have to worry about the sunset until about 9 pm which gave me plenty of flight time, I jumped off the cliff side and moved my wings to get a lift a bit and I was off, for the first hour everything felt great it was surreal the wind rushing through my hair the birds flying below me, everything was it should be.

That was until 6:28 pm when I looked underneath me and behind, in a clearing I could clearly make out a deer sprinting full speed behind my hanglider following me I will still hundreds of feet in the air, I did I slight turn and chuckled thinking the deer thought me to be a giant bird of some sort. 15 minutes went by and the god damned thing was still running full speed never wavering in motion.i was terrified it was staring at me, it just kept staring at me I watched in horror as it ran through the brush and vines never looking away always staring up at me I was slowly getting lower to the ground almost 2 hours of watching him follow me had went by, I knew it would get dark soon and I know I most likely won't make it after I land, the more I descend the more the details of the deer come into view it looks at me with decrepit eyes decaying from it's face, It doesn't have any hair on its legs it looks red like muscle that has no more skin to cover it, it hasn't taken a break once , all I see is it's protruding bone where a tail once was and it's guts swing every now and again, if I don't update assume the worst. Tell Tiffany and Bethany I love them, I am only 60 feet away and I'm really considering just jumping to spare a different agonizing death. God bless

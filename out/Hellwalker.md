***Entry One***

Nobody really knows how the world is going to end.

We can make vague assumptions, while the wealthy elite stain the planet with their shit and piss and cigarette burns. We can only hope that our end is a peaceful one, and that all our labours amount to something when the final curtain is drawn. We can dream of a good death.

Speaking for myself, I waited for an intervention. What kind, you might ask? The divine kind. I’d always been a person of few questions, putting my faith and trust in God above everyone else. I wish I could tell you that didn’t change when it all happened, but that would be a bare-faced lie, and I hate lying. I get sick at the thought of it.

If you asked a random person on the street in the year 2046 how they thought human society was faring, you’d receive two very different kinds of answers. The first one goes something like: “We’re doing fine, man. Don’t even sweat it.”

The other one is more like this: “I wake up every day surprised that we’re not all burning to death.”

Things were going about as we all expected. Technology was rising; artificial intelligence had created a monopoly on the market, and everybody wanted something like it. Everyone wanted a TV that turned itself on and curated detailed lists of your favourite shows and movies automatically. Everyone wanted self-cooking meals and self-driving cars and a self-governing world. It was just easier that way. It made ignoring the wars and chaos easier.

No, this isn’t going where you think it’s going. The world wasn’t overtaken by a malevolent A.I. or armies of defecting, indignant machines. That would be far, far too predictable. Besides, if that were the case, we might’ve stood some semblance of a chance.

At midday on the twentieth of August, 2046, the sky went dark.

A solar eclipse is not a cause for global alarm. At least, not an scheduled one. The world’s sciences were baffled, of course, at the sudden cosmic phenomenon. People were told to stay inside their homes and remain completely calm, and told that there was nothing to worry about. Don’t look directly at the eclipse. You could be blinded when it’s finished.

But when it hadn’t stopped after almost fifteen hours, people began to panic.

When you deprive entire nations of sunlight for longer than a day, things begin to unravel. The world’s governments initiated martial law. The servers and stock markets crashed. The internet stopped working. All over the planet, people were living in a nightmare. There was no answer for what was happening. There was no cause, and no reason, and there was no way out.

It got worse when people started killing themselves. 

The eternal night and the seeming collapse of society caused everyday people to begin losing their sanity. I can’t say I know the feeling in certainty, but I’ve been close to complete madness many times before. It starts with the panic. The panic rolls into terror. When the terror invades every waking moment of your life, you realise there’s only one way to escape it. There’s only one solution to the end of the world, and that’s to stop living in it.

I never saw any solid figures. With the internet permanently down, all we had was the gossip between neighbourhoods and towns. The only thing I knew for sure was that people were committing suicide in droves, all over the state. It wouldn’t have been much of a stretch to assume that this persisted across the country – and across the world. Every morning – without sunlight, we only measured time randomly – I would leave my house to get supplies and see new bodies hanging on the telephone wires.

Almost all of them were families.

We lost contact with the powers that be very quickly. That meant that there was no higher answer for our ruined world. There was no explanation, and some of us didn’t need one. Our purpose was clear: hunt, survive, reproduce… pray. 

God does not make mistakes. I know this, and I know His steadfast devotion to humanity will never crumble. But… there is no lie in what I am about to say: I lost my faith when the world ended. God is all-loving and all-sorrowful of our plight but my faith in His holy abilities was torn away from me the moment I understood what was happening to our world. I never believed I would live to see the Rapture, and I was right. This was not the end of days, as I had been told it would be. This was the end of days as it was meant to be.

Restless. Despairing. Monstrous.

My partner and I were never wealthy. We had as much as we needed to be happy, but we were far from drowning in our profits. When the world ended, we had as much as the bare essentials. Our house was warm and secure, we had plenty of canned food in storage, and access to running water. Other families weren’t so lucky. I heard my neighbour yelling in agony one night as I sat by my son’s bed, stroking his hair in an attempt to coax him into sleep.

My neighbour began to scream for his mother. He told her it was so cold, and he was so hungry. He bawled and writhed and groaned for hours, asking desperately for someone to forgive him. No, not asking… begging. The next night, his wails had been silenced. I didn’t check up on him. I preferred not to think about what he’d been forced to do.

Every day was about the same as the last; we had a regimented schedule, and those who had survived all agreed it was the right one. Every ‘morning’, we’d search for supplies and fortify our bunkers. The only thing that mattered was the continuation of our lives, even if we were alive in abject suffering. Maybe this was Hell. Maybe the Devil had won. Maybe we all deserved this.

My old friend from work had a polaroid camera. He loved taking pictures of everything he could see with it. At work parties, he’d bring the thing out and shove it in all our faces, and we happily obliged his hobby. We found it endearing. After the end, all cell phones stopped working, almost simultaneously, and so the only thing left to record our situation was typewriters, paper, pencils, the occasional pen, and old cameras.

One night as I lay awake in bed – night was constant, but we still had our old human routines – I heard somebody scratching at my front door. It was so quiet that, if I had been asleep, I would have never heard it. I rushed outside and found my friend at the porch, lying in a puddle of his own blood and vomit. I brought him inside and tried to tend to his wounds. He was badly mutilated and broken, almost to the point of death. I checked him over and when I saw his eyes, I felt the most intense fear that I have ever experienced pervade through my body. I could *see* his terror, complete and abominable, staring back at me through his glassy expression. He had seen something that imprinted itself onto his gaze.

He died on my couch that night. He never spoke a single word, just stared at me and choked. As he died, he pushed his polaroid camera into my hands, coughing up one last glob of blood and mucus as his body finally gave out on him. I was more horrified than saddened, I have to admit, and I resisted every primal urge in my mind and soul that screamed at me not to look at his camera. I had to know, I just *had* to understand what it was that killed my friend.

Pressing the large button on the camera’s back, it began printing out a photograph of the last thing it had captured. It felt like the process was taking hours, and I found my leg to be rapidly dancing up and down in fear and anticipation. When the photo was ready, I gently pried it from the camera’s metal lips with a shaking hand. I prayed – not to God but to the world itself – that what I would see would not curse me forever.

My prayers went unanswered that night.

What I saw was an image of the woods just beyond my house, the ones our children used to play in past their bedtimes and after school, the ones we built treehouses in and had stupid teenage parties in, where we dumped our trash and our used condoms and empty bottles, where the old man whose arms a pockmarked lattice of diseased flesh hanged himself after a lifetime of screaming, screaming about the Hell that awaited us, about the truth behind it all and the chaos lurking just around the corner.

What stood in front of the woods, in the photo, was not a person. Even in the petrified and darkened state humanity was in, and despite the horror our world had become, I could still recognise my fellow human. I cannot tell you with any confidence that what I saw was real, but I knew it had been real enough to dehumanise and eviscerate my friend. It stood not on two legs but a multitude, and its head was more akin to a crucifix – a fact which greatly unsettled me.

I became sickened at the sight of it and dropped the photograph, kicking it under the couch and pretending it didn’t exist. What mockery of humanity was this? What entity lurked beyond our safe warmth and pretend haven? I closed my friend’s eyelids and set about burying him outside. As I dug his grave, my eyes darted from the dirt to the forest beyond. I wasn’t sure what I’d catch a glimpse of, if anything, but the mere chance of coming into contact with that *thing* put a boulder in my stomach and dragged cold spikes down my back.

I attempted to forget about what I had seen that night. Before either my partner or son could see it, I retrieved the photo from under the couch and burned it. Or, at least, I attempted to. I doused the thing in gasoline and lit it ablaze with a match, but as I watched it sit in the barbecue grill, it refused to be destroyed. Instead, it only grew more horrific in its visage. I heard a screech from the woods and promptly kicked the grill over, watching as the flames slowly extinguished themselves and the photo remained. 

If I couldn’t burn it then I’d simply bury it. Not wishing to damn my friend’s soul, I dug a hole further from his body. As deep as I could, I dug, and tossed the photo inside. I would remain content in its false death. My partner questioned my skittishness, further still when they caught me smashing the polaroid camera with a sledgehammer. I told them it wasn’t something I wanted them to see. They didn’t ask further, and I was glad of it.

Life at the end of the world was terrible enough, not for this new hell that had reared its head. Our community was shrinking by the day. Fewer and fewer of us populated the streets, and soon, the comforting consistency of my neighbours’ safe houses were ruined, when each one was broken into and raided. I couldn’t even trust myself not to get attached to the memories. After just a year, our town had gone from a population of just over twenty thousand to a despairing ninety three. Those that didn’t die by their own hands often succumbed to starvation or disease. 

But then there were those who were murdered.

Ever since my friend’s death, I began to notice things amiss in my house. Doors were opened when I had been sure they were locked. Objects of great importance, be they sentimental or key in survival, began to go missing. At first I suspected my son, only four years old, to have taken and played with them, but he was not the type of child to steal. He was a good, kind boy, and I pitied him the most for having to suffer through this torturous world.

At one time, I was preparing food and opened a cabinet drawer, retrieving a knife from inside. I turned my back for a mere second, and when I returned my gaze, the drawer was closed and a second knife was placed on the countertop. Its blade glistened in the candlelight. 

My partner began to complain about noises waking them up in the night. I told them it was likely just the neighbours, but then they told me the noises were coming from inside the house itself. I asked if they could be sure, and they swore to me that they had heard scratching and creaking in the hallway. I stayed up as late as I could to make them feel safe, and heard nothing. But as I drifted off to sleep, I began hearing them scream in terror. 

The bodies were often found in their beds, faces contorted in pain and fear and arms splayed out like a crucifixion. This fact alone was cause enough for alarm, but what worsened the fright was what was always found on the bodies, carved into them through a hole in the stomach – an apple. I remembered the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Knowledge, and I began to suspect that this was the work of some crazed killer. A serial killer at the end of the world was a fanciful notion, and one, I believe, that could have saved me from the true horror of what was actually happening.

I was known in the town as a religious person, despite my loss of faith at the eclipse. My neighbours, those that remained, pleaded with me to call upon my God and ask Him for forgiveness. In turn, I asked them what exactly they expected me to do, and they all responded in the same way: they believed this was their punishment for something. One by one, they began to confess to me things that I never knew, things I never wanted to know, things that marred my perception of them almost instantly.

“It was just one time, I never meant to hurt her!” “Oh God… he killed himself after I did it. I didn’t want that to happen!” “Nobody ever told me the truth, I just wanted to have it for myself!”

Their words sickened me, and I boarded up my house from the outside. My son, a very curious boy, asked me why everybody wanted to talk to me. I told him they were very scared, and they wanted to speak to me because I used to have a friend who people would rely on a lot. He asked who I meant, and, not wanting to bore or confuse him with all the definitions, I simply told him he was somebody like Santa. This friend was very wise and very special, and he gave hope and comfort to a lot of people, including me at one time.

When he asked why I didn’t believe in him anymore, I took a deep breath before giving my answer.

“Because he’s been quiet for a long time, and I’m scared he’s not listening to me anymore.”

My partner’s doctor was murdered last week. She was found in the same state as the others: confined to her bed, arms spread wide, face twisted in horror, and the same crimson apple buried in her abdomen. That night, my partner told me we had to leave. I asked them to where would we go, but they simply told me to listen. Every night since the eclipse, they had had the same recurring nightmare. In it, our home was overrun with monsters, hiding in the dark and slowly cutting pieces of our bodies off us while we slept. Eventually, there would be nothing remaining but our souls, and they’d feast on those too.

The sounds coming from downstairs got worse that day. I began to hear them too. What started off as croaking sounded more like laughing now, and the screams across the street began to sound more agonised and tortured. It was getting worse. I knew there was nowhere to go, but this place was becoming something else, something far more evil. Two nights ago, I began packing everything vaguely necessary to our survival. I had filled up the garage several hours later, planning to drive into the wilderness for as long as possible. Our car ran on electricity, and I had saved up twelve batteries since the eclipse for a moment like this.

I had it all planned out. And then my plans were destroyed.

Last night, as I stared at the ceiling and did my damndest to rid my brain of terrible thoughts and questions, I heard my son’s door creak open. Assuming he had had a nightmare and was coming to sleep in our room, I sat up and awaited him. His presence would surely calm me. But there was no sound from the hallway. I stared into the darkness, counting the seconds since I heard the noise. After thirty of them had passed by, I quietly left my bed and walked towards his door.

It was ajar, and through the crack I could make out his curtains swaying gently. I opened the door all the way and felt my body freeze in confusion and horror. His window was wide open, the black sky laughing down at me with its unforgiving cold. My son’s bed was empty. He was gone. I stood in complete fright for a moment before bolting to the window, breathing heavily and shaking uncontrollably. There was no sign of him. I pulled off the duvet on his bed and found it to not be as empty as I thought. In the indentation where my son had once slept, there was a single red apple.

It rolled over slightly and I saw that a tiny chunk had been taken out of it. The bite of a child.

I screamed and wailed, dropping to my knees and bashing my fists against the bedframe. My partner rushed in moments later, and their cry was piercing and agonised. We held each other for hours, sobbing in terror and misery at the truth of the night. Our son had been taken. He was not murdered but stolen, stolen from his bed as he slept and taken away to only God knows where. 

I held my partner close to me as we wept. They passed out from sheer exhaustion several hours later, and I set about gathering supplies. I packed weapons and rations, compasses and maps and absolutely anything I thought would aid on my journey. I was going to find my son. Nothing would keep me from him, no demon or monster or beast would defeat me in my search for him. Once I was ready, I began this account. It serves as a reminder of my history, and of what I must do. It serves, also, as a memento of the ghastly journey I have taken to arrive at my current point. 

When I return with my son, and upon his eighteenth birthday, I shall give him this account and tell him it is his to do with as he pleases. He may read it, ignore it or even burn it if he wants, but it is his and his alone. I am not blinding myself with optimism; I know I will succeed. My son will return home, even if I do not.

My partner wanted to call upon the whole neighbourhood to search with me, but I convinced them to let me go alone. Those left behind would only slow me down. Too weakened to protest, they obliged. Our mutual friends agreed to stay with them as much as they could to help them feel safe, and I’m more than confident in them and their abilities. I promised them I’d bring our son home. I think they would rather die than see him never return. 

I’ve already started walking. I know whatever took him went into the forest, so that is where I shall look. Beyond that lies a world I have never seen, one I will not recognise. There are forces out there beyond my knowledge and understanding, and whatever took my son will do all it can to kill me or keep him stolen. I do not doubt that Satan himself would cower at the world I live in. Hell is but a weak shadow of this place, and I have long since stopped waiting for God to answer me. 

If He is out there, as I suspect He is, He is no doubt waiting for me to fail.

I cannot defeat my God… but I do intend to prove Him wrong.

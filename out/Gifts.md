A cold winter morning, two days away from Christmas, what a time to be alive! I felt the warm air conditioning brush into my face as my daughter and I stepped into the gift shop.

-Ya’ know where we are Stacy? We’re here to buy your Christmas gifts! Are you excited?- 

-Yes dad, I’m super-duper excited! Come on, let’s go to the dolls section!- 

She took my hand and practically dragged me along as she frantically sprinted towards her favorite dolls. 

-Ouu, I like this one daddy! Can I get this one?! Ohh, but this red one is really pretty too, which one can I get, daddy?- 

-Why not take them both, sweetie! Let’s go see the plushies, you can get some of those as well.- 

-Really, daddy? Thank you so much! I love the plushies so, so much.- 

This made me happy. As silly as it may sound, seeing Stacey happy is what keeps me happy. That’s the reason I get up every day and eat up so much shit at work. Seeing her smile makes all the stress and abuse worth it, it’s so worth it. 

I was walking alongside her, holding her little hand as we made our way into the plushies section when, I saw a homeless guy just sitting there. He had long, blonde hair and quite a lazy beard. He was just right in the middle of the aisle, watching Stacey with a disgustingly creepy smile on his face. How the hell did I not notice him there before? It’s like he… just appeared out of thin air! When I thought things couldn’t get any more disturbing, I noticed Stacy waving at him. 

-Hi there, little one. Is your daddy getting you all the gifts you want?- Said the hobo as he waved back. 

I’m usually not one to judge, but I don’t particularly appreciate my daughter talking to homeless people. That’s literally step one to getting kidnapped. So I decided to put an end to this little situation before it escalated. 

-HEY! Who the hell ya’ think you’re talking to buddy?! Get your dirty eyes off my daughter, RIGHT NOW!- 

I then pulled Stacy out of that man’s sight, and calmly whispered into her ear:

-Stacy. You know you can’t go around talking to strangers, okay? That’s one of our rules, don’t forget our rules, sweetie.- 

She whispered back: 

-But dad, he was nice to me! He’s a nice stranger.- 

-There’s no such thing as a “nice stranger” Stacy. Please, let’s just go and pick out some plushies before the shop closes, okay?-

Then I heard the hobo speak to her again… great. 

-I know you can still hear me, little one. Your dad can buy you material gifts, but I on the other hand, can grant you *real* gifts. Gifts that will last you a lifetime and will keep my brother away from you.- 

I just couldn’t take this bullshit any longer. I picked up Stacy and carried her to the cash register. 

-Daddy! Put me down! I wanna get a plushie! You promised!- 

-You broke our rules, Stacy! I can’t reward you when you behave like that, you know this. I’m sorry but you missed your chance, you’ll have to settle with your two dolls.- 

-But… that’s not fair. I just said hi to the stranger because he said hi to me! I don’t wanna be rude. Not being rude is also one of our rules! Please daddy, just let me get *one* plushie. I really, really, really, want one.- 

I can’t say no to that little face. 

-Fine, let me deal with the stranger and then we can go get your plushie.- 

I left her with one of the security guards and made my way towards the front desk. 

-Good morning miss. I would like to express a concern. There’s a homeless person just sitting there on aisle five, and he’s been harassing my daughter. It’s really distracting and uncomfortable for me, so could you please get someone to remove him from the shop? Thanks.- 

-Of course sir. I apologize for the severity of this situation. Let me locate him on the security cameras, and then I’ll make sure he doesn’t bother you anymore.- 

The lady just stared at her screen for a few moments and then spoke again: 

-Uh, sir. There’s nobody on aisle five. I looked all over and it’s completely empty. Are you sure that’s the correct location?- 

-Yes, that’s the correct location. How can you not see him? He even had a blanket and everything. He should be right there!- 

-Well, I’m afraid he’s not “right there”. Is there anything else I can do to help?- 

I didn’t answer her last question, I just left and went to see for myself. Sure enough, there was no sign of the hobo. Not even the *interesting* smell that accompanied him previously. Did I just… imagine that entire interaction? It can’t be, Stacey saw him too! Agh, whatever. I’m not going to let this foolishness ruin my Christmas spirit.

I made my way back to where I had left my daughter. And she was excited to see me! More than likely just excited to get her plushies, but like I said, if she’s happy, I’m happy. It’s all worth it if I get to see her smile. 

-We’re set, Stacy. Let’s go get your plushies.- 




She picked out five different plushies, $12 each. That didn’t matter to me, her smile made me forget about the price tag. I held her hand as I walked her to the cash register, her sparkling little eyes staring at me while I took out my credit card and payed for her gifts. 

-Did you like your gifts, Stacy? You know we’re only here because it’s Christmas, don’t expect this to become a regular thing for us, okay sweetie?-

-I know, dad. Thank you so, so much. I loved my gifts!- 

She got in our shopping cart and asked me to roll her out of the store, all the way to the car. Of course I said yes, what did you expect? But then, the security guard stopped us at the front door. 

-Hold on, sir. I need to check your receipt before I can allow you to exit the store.- 

I took my eyes off of Stacy for just a moment, while I reached into my pocket to find that damn receipt. 

-Okay, everything looks in order here. Thank you for your purchase and merry Christmas!- 

I couldn’t help but smile at the guard, and patted him on the shoulder as I replied: 

-Thank you! Merry Christmas to you as well, sir.- 

But, when I looked back down at the cart… Stacy wasn’t there anymore. I panicked. 

-What the hell?! Where did she go? Did you see her leave the store?!- 

-Uh, no, no I didn’t, sir. I lost focus for a moment when I was checking your receipt, you were the one who was looking at her!- 

Great, just what I needed. The guard radioed the front desk and soon the shop went into lock-down and every employee started looking for my daughter. However, nobody seemed to have any luck in finding her! I went back to aisle five, and there she was, talking to that god damn hobo again and holding his dirty hand! 

-I WARNED YOU. GET YOUR HANDS OFF HER RIGHT NOW!- 

I charged at him, but then, he just… vanished. It’s like I blinked and then suddenly he wasn’t there anymore. My uncomfortableness only worsened when I noticed a few people staring. Great, now everyone in this damn store thinks I’m crazy or something! But he was right there… wasn’t he? 

I just tried to escape this situation as quickly as possible. I walked up to Stacy, picked her up and just walked out the store with her gifts in hand. 

-Just get in the car, Stacy. It’s fine, I’m not mad, just worried.- 

-My friend Jesus told me that he was gonna give me a real gift, daddy!- 

-Who’s your friend Jesus? That psycho you were talking too on the store?!- 

-No silly, Jesus is the son of God. I don’t know what that word means but he probably isn’t a “psycho”.- 

Oh my god. Now my daughter thinks she was talking to Jesus! This is why I’m scared of taking her out in public. 

-What did your friend say to you? Did he threaten you?- 

-No. He said that his brother is mean, and that material gifts attract him. Real gifts are things that last your whole life, and have a *biiiiig* impact on it.- 

-Stacy, look. I know a couple of toys aren’t gonna change your life. But it’s not about what they offer you, it’s about what they mean. I bought you all this stuff because I love you and I want you to know that and never forget it. Your friend can keep his “real” gifts, for now.- 

-He says thank you.- 

-What? Who are you talking about? Who says thank you?- 

-Jesus’ brother, daddy. He says that all this stuff is more than enough for him to enter our home.- 

I looked at my rear view mirror, and I swear to whoever’s holy that for a split second I saw someone in my back seat. Someone who was wearing a clean, black suit. And had two, giant red horns on his head.

 After my wife died, I was left to raise our two daughters, Jade and Louise, alone. Losing a spouse is never easy, but I knew I had to be strong for our girls; I tried to keep my weeping to a minimum and only in private, and I tried my best to fulfill not only the stern, fatherly role, but also the softer, more understanding motherly role as well. 

 Jade was 15 and Louise had just turned 6; Less than two months after her mother passed I had already caught Jade sneaking out of the house twice and had a strong suspicion she was smoking pot. I knew that I was going to have my hands full, so while I put my foot down, I didn't overreact to her behavior. I know that everyone deals with death in their own way, and antagonizing my eldest could lead to dire consequences for our relationship. 

 I made it a habit of mine to check in on both girls when they were going to sleep. The first night that it happened, I remember passing the bathroom and seeing Louise on her stool, brushing her teeth. "Make sure they're nice and white!" I called out playfully to her and she giggled. I made my way down the hall and to Jade's room. We had a brief conversation about her failing to turn in her schoolwork, and then I bade her goodnight and headed back down the hall. I walked up to Louise's door and knocked softly, as I always did before just barging in. Usually, she would quickly give me permission to come in; Tonight, though, she was silent. I knocked twice more, my ear against the door. "You okay, honey?" No response. Surely she hadn't fallen asleep that quickly? I put my hand on the doorknob, turning it slowly as I entered the dark room. 

 The moonlight was bathing the room, coming in through the drapes which hadn't been drawn; Louise was already in bed, the covers concealing her. I smiled; She must have had a long day at school. I was beginning to walk towards the window when something suddenly caught my attention. A pair of pale, wrinkled feet, too long to belong to my daughter, were sticking out of the covers at the foot of her bed. It took me a second to register what I was looking at; This was no trick of the light...someone was lying in my daughter's bed. I followed the feet, noticing for the first time that the lump under the covers was much too large to be my Louise. I began to apprehensively approach the bed, unable to blink or speak. What exactly was I going to see when I moved the covers? 

 I began to reach my hand out towards the Hello Kitty comforter, but a hand reached towards me as well; Emaciated and long-fingered, with rotten fingernails that were falling out. I stumbled backwards, and I must have fallen and hit my head because I don't remember anything else. When I came to, Louise and Jade were both standing over me, Louise clutching her teddy bear. 

 "Dad? Dad you're scaring us, are you okay?" 

 I groaned, sitting up and rubbing the back of my head. "I'm fine...what happened?" 

 That was when I remembered; I jumped up and tore back Louise's sheets, but there was nothing there; I moved over to her closet, throwing it open as well, but there was no ghoul or witch to be found. Sweat running down my face, I turned around to see the terrified faces of my daughters and felt instantly guilty.

 "Hey, sorry girls. Daddy lost his car keys, just checking to see if they were in here. Get back in bed, everything's okay." 

 I thought about that night for a few days after it happened. I made sure to be thorough when putting Louise to bed, and soon I wondered if I had just hallucinated the whole thing. I had been tired that night, after all. Louise would have told me had she seen anyone else in the house, surely. A week later I let Jade go to a party, giving her strict instructions to be home by eleven. As I watched her hop into a car with her friends, which sped off entirely way too fast, I immediately regretted my decision. I locked the front door and headed back to the kitchen to finish dinner with Louise. 

 An old woman was sitting at the table where my daughter had previously been. She had disheveled, thin white hair, a gray visage of unmistakable death, and yellow eyes full of pus. She wore a tattered black dress and a gold locket around what was undoubtedly a broken neck; Her head hung at a terrible angle, black blood dripping out of her open maw. She paid me no mind, scooping her spoon into my daughter's bowl. My mouth fell open in horror as I stared at her, tears rolling down my face. This was terrible; Who the fuck was she? What had she done with Louise? 

 The ghoul raised the spoon, and what had once been macaroni was now maggots; She put them hungrily into her mouth before finally looking at me. 

 "What's wrong, Daddy?" she croaked in a  raspy voice from hell, and I screamed and ran from the room. I tripped, falling to the floor, and then tried to crawl to the front door. I had to get the fuck out of there...What I was seeing didn't make sense...

"Daddy?" 

 I stopped, remaining on my stomach as I looked back at my daughter. Louise was standing there looking confused; She was still holding her spoon. 

"What's wrong? Why do you keep falling?" 

 I couldn't find the words to speak. I swallowed before pushing myself into a sitting position. "Honey...did you see anything in there?" 

 Louise looked back into the kitchen before turning back to me, grinning. "You're silly Daddy!" She ran up to me and I confess, I was terrified; Still, I hugged her, and she ran back into the kitchen to finish her supper. I had suddenly lost my appetite. 

 Surely I was going insane; My wife's death had hit me harder than I'd expected after all. How could it not? I hadn't even been able to bring myself to look at the post-accident photos; Her own parents had to be the ones to identify her. Losing her was the worst thing that had ever happened to me, but this shit was beyond insane. I immediately got in contact with the therapist that I had been referred to after the accident but had never actually seen. I had to deal with whatever was going on in my mind before I lost it completely. 

 I was afraid to look at Louise over the next two days; I feared that the next time I let my guard down or turned a corner, I'd find the dead woman waiting for me. When I finally made it to the therapist's office, I was relieved; Maybe finally talking to someone about the accident was all that I needed. The therapist introduced herself as Ashley. She seemed nice enough. We talked about my job, my childhood, my hopes and dreams and whether I felt like I was where I needed to be. And then the topic of my wife came up. 

 "So tell me, in your own time, what happened to her." Ashley put down her notebook and pen, looking at me intently. I sighed and glanced down at the floor. 

 "It's sad, really. I remember it like it was yesterday...I was at work when I got the phone call. It was a one-vehicle accident; It just didn't make sense...the car had been completely totaled and Casey...it was bad, or that's what my father-in-law said anyway. I just don't get it. How...and why...why did it have to happen to her? Out of all people, why her?" 

 Ashley sat there for a moment, nodding. "I understand. You're exactly right. The worst things seem to happen to the nicest people. I lost my grandmother in a freak accident as well, a long time ago, much like you lost Casey. I think about it everyday, but I know that she would want me to move on, not to linger. And that is what Casey would want from you as well. You have to be there for your girls. They're mourning too." 

 I couldn't bring myself to mention the goddamn corpse that I had been seeing, but the session still went incredibly well. I hoped that it would make a difference, that it would save me from my impending insanity. It had to. I didn't have any other choice. 

 I dreamt about Casey that night. She was in her wedding dress, her eyes shining brighter than any star. She was in front of a garage, holding a bouquet of roses, slowly coming towards me. I was sitting in my car, watching her, but then, suddenly, the car was moving; I tried to grab at the steering wheel but it was gone. My mouth fell open as I screamed and the car surged forward-

 And then I was awake; I sat up, drenched in sweat, and found myself face to face with the dead woman, crouching in my bed in front of me. I swung; My fist took her in the cheek and she toppled over, out of my bed. 

 "What do you want from me, huh? *What do you fucking want from me!*" 

 "Ouch, Daddy! I just wanted a hug!" Louise was standing in front of me, holding her face and looking offended. She turned and ran out of the room. I felt terrible. I wanted to get up and follow after her, but I decided that staying put would be best. I couldn't let her see the cracks that were beginning to widen. I needed to save me from myself and I needed to do it fast. 

 The next two weeks were hell; What I had been fearing had actually come true. I was seeing the old woman more than I was seeing my daughter; Lying on the floor, kicking her veiny legs as she watched cartoons; running around and playing in the backyard, her broken neck barely keeping her head on; sneaking into the kitchen late at night as I sat on the couch, grabbing snacks before creeping behind me on the couch and slowly wobbling up the stairs. It's a wonder I hadn't completely snapped by the time my next therapy session arrived. I knew that I was going to have to lay it all on the table this time; Even if it meant that it was possible the girls might be taken from me, I had to do this. I was certainly going to become a danger to them if I allowed this infection to spread. What if I began seeing Jade as an undead ghoul as well? I wasn't going to take any chances. 

 My mother-in-law called me twice, but I didn't answer her. I needed to focus on this therapy session; I would call her back afterwards. I straightened my baseball cap, looked in the mirror to make sure I at least looked sane, and then walked into the therapist's office. 

 Ashley was sitting on her couch, waiting for me. She took off her glasses and smiled when I came in. "Most people look distressed or angry that they have to do these sessions with me. You, however, look somewhat excited." 

 I smiled as well as I took the same seat that I had chosen before. "Yeah, well. I guess I still have a lot that I want...need...to get off my chest." 

 "I'm all ears." 

 I swallowed. "Right. Um, well, I uh...I don't know exactly how to put this. But I...I've been seeing..." 

 Ashley leaned forward, nodding and encouraging me to continue, and that was when it swung forward. A gold locket, identical to the one that I had been seeing swinging around the dead woman's broken neck. All of the air in the room seemed to have been suddenly sucked away; My words were lost in my throat, and I stared, my eyes widening, at the locket. Ashley looked concerned at first, and then she followed my line of sight. 

 "Oh, this?" Her voice sounded as though she was standing a million miles away from me. "This was my grandmother's. My mother gave it to me after the accident." 

 Suddenly I was six years old again. I was riding my bike down the street, outraced and left behind by my friends. I slowed to a stop, upset, and watched them as they kept going. It just wasn't fair...why was I so slow and unable to keep up? I noticed movement to my left. I looked over and watched as the old woman, her frail body in a black dress, got out of her SUV. She glanced back at me, smiled, and then moved towards her closed garage door. 

 "Mr. Buttons, why do you always insist on waiting right here? This is why I have to you leave you in the house, or else I'll run you over!" 

 She was talking to a black cat that was perched in the driveway in front of the garage door. My six-year old mind saw the car and knew that it was faster than any bike could be; I'd smoke my friends with ease. I hopped off of my bike and walked over to the car, climbing in through the open door. The woman had left it on and running; She was surely moving the cat so that she could pull in. I could barely see over the steering wheel, but I thought I would be able to figure it out; Mom and dad made driving look easy. 

 I pulled on the gearshift and the car shot forward. A look of utter terror and shock came across the old woman's face as she held her cat; The SUV slammed hard into her, pinning her against the garage, and the cat hopped out of her arms. I stared into her wide eyes as blood ran out of her mouth, dripping down onto her locket, her head hanging unnaturally. Slowly, she slumped forward onto the hood, motionless. I guess I didn't quite register what had just happened, but I knew that it wasn't good; I jumped back out of the car, hopped on my bike, and pedaled off as fast as I could. 

 "How...how did she pass?" I asked, my mouth dry. 

 Ashley fiddled with the locket. "She pinned herself between the garage and her car. The police think she was probably picking up her cat and the car shifted out of gear. That's what I meant when I said freak accidents happen." 

 I couldn't be there anymore; The memory that I hadn't even known I had was overwhelming me, and I ran out of the office. I made it to my car, hyperventilating as I stood next to it. I had killed a woman...a poor, innocent woman...and now she was appearing to me...though I had forgotten, she never did...

 I had to get away, far away from Ashley. My guilt was practically oozing from my pores. I sped down the street, not paying attention to signs or other cars. Nothing made sense and yet everything did at the same time...

 And then the collision happened and I was thrown through the windshield. 

 When I came to, there were sirens in the distance; Someone was sobbing, and I was still lying in the street, broken glass around me as I bled from my mouth. I sat up, looking around hazily, and then I saw them. My mother-in-law was on the ground outside her car, crying uncontrollably as she clutched at a pale, emaciated hand that hung limply from the passenger side. Tears formed in my own eyes as my concussed mind finally realized what I had just done. 

 *"Louise!"*

[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uw31yq/shatterface_part_1/)

Small towns didn't keep secrets for long. Only two days after we had found the bodies of the two teenagers, the entire town seemed to know about the bizarre deaths. What was more frustrating however was that despite everyone knowing about them, nobody seemed to have any hints as to what had happened. 48 hours after the discovery, I still didn't have a single lead.

The morning of the third day I sat at my desk at the police station, unsure how to proceed with the investigation. Photos of the crime scene were scattered all over the desk, as well as Vivian's autopsy report and the profiles of the victims. I didn't even have any suspects at that point. All I had were two boys who had drowned without a trace of water on their bodies.

Considering that I was pretty much out of options by now, I thought about driving to the morgue again and asking Vivian to take another look at the bodies, just in case she had missed some small detail. However, before I could to exactly that, my thoughts were interrupted by someone approaching my desk.

A girl, not older than twenty. She had long, hot pink hair and wore heavy make-up, her ears, nose and eyebrows were pierced. Her clothes were all black, her jeans ripped, her boots reached all the way up over her knees. "Hey", she greeted me. "Are you the guy who investigates the dead boys?"

And I thought: finally, a friend, a witness, someone who would help me in this cursed case. "Yes, that's me. Jonathan Reed", I confirmed and hoped that my relief wasn't too obvious.

"Okay, cool. I'm Kylie Moore", she introduced herself. "I'm here because of Martin Porter."

Just like that, my high hopes were crushed again and all I could think of was: "Who?!"

"Martin Porter", she repeated with a hint of annoyance in her voice. "The alleged *suicide* two years ago."

"Well, I only moved here about a year ago, so..."

"Oh." Her expression changed, first surprise and then something almost resembling relief. "That's great, you're not one of those morons who called this a suicide. Listen, he didn't kill himself!"

"Kylie!", I interrupted her. "I'm not saying I don't believe you, but I don't know anything about this person and I'm currently really busy with this other case. So why don't you come back later and we go over this?" I felt bad for sending her away as I saw the determination in her face, and how she had her hands clenched into fists in what I could only assume was anger about this old case. But I couldn't bother with anything else. Not now.

"No! Just let me finish talking, for fuck's sake. Martin's death and these two boys you're investigating are connected, okay?"

Maybe this was getting somewhere, after all. "Why don't you sit down, Kylie?", I offered, gesturing at the chair on the opposite side of my table. "And explain to my why you think that."

She sat down, hands resting in her lap, and suddenly she seemed nervous. Her eyes darted around the room, looking at everything but me, but she started to speak almost immediately. "Martin and I went to school together. We never really hung out or anything, he just... he asked me out, about a week before he died."

Oh. Oh that poor girl. "Hey, I get that you feel guilty", I told her with as much compassion as I could. "But your rejection wasn't the reason for his suicide..."

"Oh my god, will you just shut up and listen to me", she snapped, all visible anxiety suddenly gone. "I didn't reject him, I said yes. I wanted to go out with him." She crossed her arms. "He didn't kill himself, okay? Why would he, we would have gone on a date the next weekend."

Well, she had a point there, this was atypical. I had seen some suicides in my past job and this detail sounded very off. On the other hand, outliers existed. The chances were low, sure, but they were never zero.

"These boys died by that lake in the forest, right?", she continued after a short pause. "Martin drowned in that lake. And he didn't do this to himself."

Now that was certainly a connection. An accidental one maybe, random and entirely meaningless, but that was to be seen later. For now, I would grasp this straw, considering it was the only one I had. "How about you come with me to the archive and we'll check Martin's file for any hints? You can tell me more about him on the way there", I offered with a small smile.

"For real?"

"Yeah, sure."

She beamed, genuinely happy, and the bright smile made her look so much younger that I wondered wether she was still a teenager. "Cool. Let's go then!"

She told me some things about Martin Porter and I wasn't sure what to make of most of them. According to her, he had been a loner, but had never seemed unhappy with that. They had been in the same school, but had rarely shared any classes and had barely interacted until he had asked her out. She had agreed and they had spent some more time together during the week leading up to the date.

She also mentioned that he had been interested in paranormal things, which only reminded me of Shatterface, but that was something I would bother with later.

The middle-aged archivist gave me a weird look for bringing the girl with me to the archive, but I didn't bother explaining anything to him, just began to search through the files while Kylie stood behind me and waited. "He was researching some local folklore", she told me. "He always got so excited when he talked about this stuff."

Once again reminded of the ghost story Vivian had mentioned, I pushed the thought aside for now and retrieved the file from one of the cabinets. It was rather thin, indicating that not a lot of work had been done with this particular case. I opened it on top of the cabinet and Kylie went quiet as both of us read through the few lines that had been written down.

Martin Porter had been sixteen when he had died. His body had been found in the small lake in the woods, the cause of death had been determined by Dr. Vivian Stone as "drowning". His backpack, his jacket and his shoes had been found next to the lake, neatly put together, his bicycle had been leaning against a nearby tree. There hadn't been any hint of another human being there with him. No injuries, no signs of a struggle.

It sounded like a suicide, I could barely deny that. However, there was one other possibility, one that was so ridiculous I shouldn't even consider it. Maybe I wouldn't have thought about it at all if Kylie hadn't managed to convince me that Martin Porter had no reason to kill himself.

I skipped through the remaining pages, but there was no evidence except for the body and what had been found by the lake, as well as a very brief statement from his mother who had claimed that her son hadn't seemed depressed at all despite being a loner. The investigation had apparently been over after that, mere twenty-four hours after the body had been found.

"Kylie", I said, turning to my companion. "What did he research exactly?"

She furrowed her brows in confusion. "Some local folklore, like I said. Not sure if you know that, it's a famous ghost story around here. Shatterface."

And just like that I was sure that she was right, that there was a connection between these deaths and that this connection was the legend of Shatterface. I wasn't one to believe in ghost stories, but in a bizarre case like this, I refused to believe that this was merely a coincidence. Whatever had happened to Martin Porter, it was probably the same that had happened to Brandon Hayes and Peter McLeod and it certainly had something to do with Shatterface. Vivian was right, I had to get to the bottom of ths legend if I wanted to solve this case.

"Listen, I don't believe in this ghost bullshit", Kylie continued. "But he said he had evidence. Photos and shit. He wanted to show me on our date, but that never happened and I didn't really want to bother his mom to let me search through his stuff, because... you know, what should I say? *Hey, I'm the girl your dead son wanted to date, I just want to see the ghost pictures he promised me.* Not really great, hm?"

"Probably not", I agreed absentmindedly. The fact that he'd had evidence for Shatterface's existence caught me off-guard. Up until now I had worked under the pretense of finding some natural phenomenon behind the ghost story. Again, I wasn't one to believe in things like this. But real, physical evidence was hard to deny. I skipped through the file again, front to back, but nothing of that sort was mentioned.

"I need to see this evidence", I told Kylie, my plan already made up in my mind. "It's not here, so it's hopefully still in his home. Do you want to come along?"

She looked at me, her blue eyes wide, and despite her tough appearance she looked incredibly vulnerable in that moment. "So you believe me?", she asked, her voice barely more than a whisper and when I confirmed her question, a relieved smile spread on her lips. "Thank you, Mr. Reed!" And she threw  her arms around my neck and hugged me.

I awkwardly reciprocated the hug, a bit overwhelmed by her sudden outburst. "Just... call me Jonathan", I offered, not knowing what else to say, and freed myself from her embrace. "Come on, let's go."

I told her a few details about the current case while we were driving. Most facts were public knowledge by now, so the short car ride was more than sufficiant. To be honest I wasn't entirely sure why I brought the girl along. I knew I wasn't supposed to bring a witness to an investigation â€“ in all my years as a cop I had never even thought about this. But she knew something. It wasn't much, maybe not nearly enough, but still more than anyone else and I could use any help I could get right now.

I noticed how nervous Kylie was when we pulled up to the Porters' house. She had fallen silent, stared straight forward while her hands were clenched around the handles of her bag. I suddenly regretted dragging this girl into this and reminded her that she didn't have to come along, that I could drive her home and just call if I needed more information from her.

"I'm fine!", she snapped at me, threw the car door open and got out. I followed quickly, joining her on her way towards the entrance. She rung the doorbell and I braced myself for the conversation with yet another grieving parent.

The woman that opened the door was around fifty, if I had to guess. Rather small, with short greying hair and glasses with a thin golden rim. "Hello, officer?", she greeted, surprise obvious on her face. "How can I help?"

I figured a direct approach was the best way to go. "Mrs Porter, we're here because of your son", I told her and paused after that, giving her a moment to understand.

All colour drained from her face, she started to shake her head. "No. No, with all due respect, officer, it's been two years. I've come to terms with it. Don't make me go through all of this again."

Kylie took a step forward, but I put a hand on her shoulder and shook my head, afraid that whatever she wanted to say would make the situation worse. Instead, I turned to the woman again and explained to her with as little detail as possible that her son may have had information that could help us in the current case and if she only let us look for said information, we wouldn't bring the topic up to her ever again.

And to both my surprise and relief, she agreed. Without even asking for our names or for the reason a teenage girl accompanied me, she led us to the room she, according to herself, had left almost untouched in the past two years, not having the heart to put her son's things away for good. She unlocked the door for us, told us to just go whenever we found what we were looking for and then turned away, tears glistening in her dark eyes.

"This is weird", Kylie proclaimed as we stood in the teenager's room, which looked as if it was still used as long as one ignored the thick layer of dust that had settled all over the furniture. "I mean, he is dead and we're just searching through his stuff, like... don't you think that's weird?!"

I shrugged. "You get used to it. I've been doing this for the past fifteen years and honestly, this is the easiest part."

She reluctantly approached the cabinet and opened it in a shy attempt to start searching and I turned my attention to the desk. I wasn't entirely sure what we were looking for, but I was confident I would recognize it when I saw it. "What's the worst part then?", Kylie asked. "The bodies?"

"The families. Telling someone that a family member won't come home again. That's the one thing you never get used to."

"Yeah... that sounds shitty", she agreed. "I don't think I could do this, honestly I would be so rude and I really can't handle crying people and... oh for fuck's sake, I can't do this!"

I turned around and saw her sitting on the floor, fingers combing through her bright hair. I sighed and thought about offering to drive her home again, but I was aware she would decline the offer anyways. "He wanted you to see this", I said instead. "You're not invading his privacy or something. We're doing this to find out the truth and that's what he would have wanted, right? Think of this as us fulfilling someone's unspoken dying wish."

"It feels wrong."

"I know." I remembered my first cases all too well. I had felt the same, but my superiors had been harsh with me back then, telling me not to care because the person was dead anyways. I had been in my early twenties back then and their words had only left me more upset, so I didn't tell Kylie that. Instead I said what I wished someone would have told me fifteen years ago. "He would be grateful if he knew what you're doing for him."

She looked up at me then, brushed her hair back once more and then nodded. "You know what, you're right. Let's do this!", she proclaimed, though the reluctance in her voice was still clearly audible. She flashed a forced smile, got up and turned to the cabinet again, resuming her work.

It didn't take too long until we found what we were looking for. Stuffed away in his closet, next to a digital camera, was a folder that contained the results of Martin Porter's research.

Most of the pages were printed photos. Some were unimportant on first glance, just showed the lake or the woods without any other meaningfull content. The other few were concerning.

One showed a person dressed in white, standing in between the trees. Another showed apparently the same person seen from the window of the room we were currently in. The third one had the person stand on the side of a road. In all three, said person was out of focus, barely a humanoid outline, despite everything else being in high-resolution.

The written notes were sparce. All of them were handwritten and short, just a few words at once, not made for anyone but the author to understand.

*"Graveyard?"* was written there, and right next to it "*Which grave???"*

*"Water. Lake" r*ead another note.

*"Dolores Fray"* was underlined and right under that name were several things written. *"Arden"* was circled several times. Then *"Cult. Lake. Body!!! No Grave??"*

There were several other notes, but most were crossed out and not to be deciphered, except for the word "body" that was repeated a concerning amount. I didn't care too much about that though, since the messy notes weren't of much use anyways. What caught my attention was the name. Whoever Dolores Fray was, she could be very well my next lead in this bizarre case and I found myself relieved that coming here hadn't been for nothing.

While I had checked the notes, Kylie had taken the photos and skipped through them. "Is this... Shatterface?", she asked, pointing at the white figure in one of the photos.

Two days ago, I would have denied this with confidence. But now I had two, maybe three dead teenagers, an inexplicable case to solve and an apparition I had seen not only once but twice. So I looked at the blurry figure in the photo and answered: "Honestly, Kylie, I have no idea."

We didn't stay for long after that. Taking the notes and pictures with us we left the house and I drove Kylie home. Despite being obviously still shaken from what had happened, she made me promise that I'd call her as soon as I had any news because she insisted on helping. After I agreed we fell silent for the rest of the ride, both of us lost in thoughts.

I dropped her off near the town's centre, turned the car around and made my way home. It was already after nightfall and the streets were empty as soon as I had left the town's centre behind me. I was thinking about what we had found and what that could mean for the case, if it even meant anything at all, while the radio was playing some song that sounded vaguely familiar. The pictures had left me uneasy, as if they had made the thing I had seen in the woods and from my bedroom window more real. And a part of my wondered if I was getting lost in something and if I was losing track of what was really important right now.

And suddenly, someone stood on the open road in front of me. A woman, with long blonde hair and white clothes, dripping with water, facing towards me with a face that looked wrong in a way I couldn't describe in that moment. I slammed the brakes, certain that the car wouldn't stop before it hit the woman with the distorted face. My hands clenched around the steering wheel and I screamed while the woman didn't move at all.

I was thrown against the seatbelt as the car came to a sudden stop. My entire body was shaking and I was breathing heavily.

The woman on the road, however, had disappeared. As if she had never existed in the first place.

I started the car again and quickly made my way back home, anxious for some company. I had never been afraid of the dark, but right now, all alone on the road where I had just seen a ghost, I was pretty much terrified.

Despite there being no other incident until I arrived at home, I couldn't stop shaking.

I grew up treasuring nature so much. If I went to the woods, fishing, or in the mountains, the tranquility these experiences brought with them had no match. Some were even ethereal. I could feel Mother Nature living and breathing, always ensuring I had everything I needed while stepping on its rich grounds.

Last year, I bought a cabin up in the mountains. I have always liked to disconnect from the city in the cold winter and just go to a place that feels like magic. This cabin had the feeling of being somewhere in that realm. 

Excitement took over me when I thought I finally had my own place in the snowy mountains. Away from the city, away from work, and from people who make so much noise that sometimes I just need a little breather.

So the acquisition of the log cabin couldn’t have come at a better time. With my head almost exploding and my mind fogged with the dullest things and the most mundane tasks possible at work, I couldn’t wait for a few days to recharge my batteries.

With no other than my trusted associate, my daring sidekick, and my best friend, the Irish Setter Blaze, who had just turned six years old, I decided to pack all the things needed and go.

I drove for almost three hours. The trees hung heavy with snow, and the flakes fell slowly on the ground. I felt like being in a fairytale. A vastness of white that conquered all the old land for miles and miles in front of my eyes.

I stopped the car somewhere along the way to get fresh water from a spring that ran through the frozen woods. The sight was a spectacle, and I couldn’t help but drink. It was so cold I felt my chest turning to ice. Yet it was so refreshing. So I took a few gallons with me for the cabin so Blaze and I wouldn’t get dehydrated.

I reached the cabin in the afternoon. The temperature began dropping as nightfall approached. I had maybe two hours tops of daylight. I parked the car, took the supplies and food inside, turned on the generator, grabbed some firewood, and threw it into the fireplace. I poured some gasoline over, and the flame engulfed the logs. After that, I began shoveling the snow on the front porch and around the house.

I also took my hunting rifle because I thought a rabbit stew wouldn’t hurt anyone. I always liked it, and Blaze liked it too. 

Time passed quickly enough, and after finishing all the chores, the time came to go inside and make some food. I had some canned dogfood for Blaze, and as I felt my stomach growling, the mouthwatering image of sausage and eggs on toast came to mind.

I lit some candles to make the ambiance more pleasant. I also turned on a lantern, and everything seemed to be perfect. Night fell over the isolated cabin, and the winter winds howled outside over the infinite blanket of snow. Shadows danced on the walls like little devils. The crackling wood sang its song, bringing peace to my tired mind.

The cabin felt like a gift from God. I had no television to distract me and didn’t check the Internet. I only kept my cellphone with me as a precautionary measure because accidents could have happened. Even though the reception had been pretty bad, it still allowed to call 911.

After finishing eating, I enjoyed a beer and a book. I fell asleep in an instant, poof, just like that. The fresh air has had this effect on me ever since I was a kid. 

The book fell from my lap and thudded on the floor. I instantly jolted awake and saw Blaze looking at the door. He stood still, mildly growling.

“What’s wrong, boy?” I asked. I could see he was trembling both with anger and fear. He began nervously barking. I had never seen him like that before. 

Outside, in the howling wintery winds, I heard some sort of static sound combined with a low gurgling sound. It was as if someone was zapping through a broken TV where one channel was just annoying static, and the next was unspeakable monsters raging.

I peeked outside and saw nothing. Then I grabbed my rifle and wanted to open the door and check it out in person. Yet, Blaze wouldn’t let me do that. Instead, he stood before the door, barking at me this time. Whatever roamed outside, Blaze felt it necessary to let me know if I went there, I would have found only death.

“What the hell is that thing out there? God dammit,” I whispered to myself. 

I glanced outside the window again, and I thought I saw a shadowy figure looking at the cabin. It looked back and then went out of sight. Blaze barked as loud as his lungs could take it. 

“Blaze, come here, boy! Get here now!” I called him. 

The only weak point was the window. If whatever was outside wanted to jump through like a beast, I said let it have it. I would have put two bullets between its eyes in seconds. Blaze would have probably eaten the whole thing in one big fat meal.

The static and gurgling sounds never ceased, even though the creature had vanished. 

I rechecked the window. Nothing, I only heard those damned sounds.

After a while, a large band came from the door. And then it came again, repeatedly. It shook, and I got my gun ready to shoot. If that door had fallen, the death of whatever was on the side would have been swift.

“Hey, man! Open up. These things outside will kill me. Please!” the voice of a scared man said. He kept banging on the door as if his life depended on it. And it did. If I didn’t act fast, the poor man would have been mauled to death by whatever beasts roamed the old mountain.

“Hold up; I’m coming!” I cried. I had to help that more man. He was probably lost, scared, alone, and dehydrated. 

Blaze jumped in front of the door. He barked at me again, pushing me back. Something was wrong if he did that.

“Come on, man, just open the goddamn door already, will ya?” he banged again. 

Blaze kept on barking violently.

“Sorry, hoss. No can do,” I replied, understanding that this was something else, not a man. I trusted Blaze more than I trusted myself. He was one brave and intelligent dog—a true friend and companion.

The beast howled, and I heard its voice changing as it drowned. It coughed, it spat, and I thought it was asphyxiating. 

“Sweetie, can you please open up for momma? I have a gift for you. It took me so long to find you, and I want to give it to you!” my mother's voice said.

“What the…?” I said, almost dropping the rifle from my hands. 

My mom died when I was just a kid, and except for her warm smile, the voice was the only other thing I remembered about her.

Then banging noises came from around the house as if the number of creatures outside had grown exponentially. 

I had gone there expecting to find paradise in solitude. But, it turns out hell had frozen over in that exact place. Nothing natural and of this world could have made those noises and then mimicked my dead mother’s voice.

Again I check the situation outside. The shadowy creatures had grown in numbers. I counted twelve of them. Six just stood motionless while the other six growled, snarled, and howled in the dead of night.

I saw one of them coming closer to the window and went a few steps back. It glued its dead eyes to the window. It didn’t have a nose, just two small holes. Its mouth was a straight horizontal line. It opened it and sucked on the window. In doing so, it revealed small rows of sharp teeth. 

“Why don’t you open up for your dear old grandfather? It’s cold outside, sonny boy,” the creature snarled. Grandpa died too when I was just a kid. After my mom’s death, he had a heart attack because he couldn’t cope with her being gone.

I just looked at it as it mimicked my grandfather’s voice. I don’t know how the hell it knew my mom’s or my grandfather’s voice, but it happened. Maybe it read my mind and browsed my memories. Maybe by doing so, it extracted their voices from my head. Hell, this sounded crazy as hell to me, but what I had witnessed shouldn’t have been possible. And, just seeing that craziness, every scenario I thought of might have been likely. 

The glass began to crack under the pressure of the creature’s face. But fortunately, I had parked the Jeep right in front of the house, so that I might have just made a run for it. 

The banging all across the house intensified, and I felt the pressure of death clawing my heart. The window would give in soon, so I said to hell with it. Instead, I pointed the rifle straight at the ugliness and pulled the trigger. It blasted its head into millions of pieces, and everything stopped. 

“Blaze, we’re gonna make a run for it, buddy!” I said, hoping for the both of us to escape that mess. 

I grabbed a burning piece of wood from the fireplace with one and busted through the door. The shadowy creatures had even grown in numbers, maybe probably twenty or thirty of them. 

Blaze barked, foaming at the mouth.

“William, William, William!” A raspy voice said. It was alien to me, not similar to anyone I knew. I turned around and saw them all gathered in a herd, waiting to attack. 

“Stay back!” I said, threatening them with the torching wood.

They hissed and collectively stepped back. I threw the wood at them and they scattered in an instant. I opened the car door for Blaze to go in, and he immediately jumped in the passenger’s seat. 

A pair of claws grabbed my ankle from under the Jeep and pulled me. It caused me to fall, and I saw the abomination crawling up on my leg. I hit it in the head with the butt of the rifle. Then, when it hissed with its horrible mouth, I put the barrel in it and shot. It blew its brain out on the side of my car. 

I hit the ignition, and the car came to life. Blaze was agitated and scared. I patted him on the head and told him it would be alright. I pushed the pedal to the metal and ran over those creatures feeling their skulls crack under the wheels. 

A few hours later, I was back in my apartment with Blaze. It was quiet. Maybe the city wasn’t so bad after all.

This happened last year. A few weeks after the incident, I received an anonymous message saying, “Hello William. You need to come back to the cabin. There are urgent matters that I need to talk to you about. I am one of your neighbors. Sincerely, Thomas.”

I did remember seeing a few houses on my way up there but didn’t think to stop. Also, the former owner had vanished into thin air.

I didn’t go back yet, maybe somewhere in the future.

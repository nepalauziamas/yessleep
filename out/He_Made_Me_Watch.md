He dragged the old wooden chair in front of me, and then sat down—still holding the rusted crowbar. We were directly in the diamond-shaped scope of sunlight from the cave’s collapsed ceiling, and I hazily watched the illumined specks of dust as they floated in and out of the illuminating column.  

Behind the glimmering motes, *he* sat staring at me, his irregularly spaced eyes fixed darkly on my bruised face. I couldn’t meet his gaze, couldn’t bring myself to stare—yet again—into those abysmal pits. The last time, there had only been a cold depravity in them; a hollowness, a chilling, inwardly spiraling darkness.  

His face, though scarred and misshapen, was expressionless; the pallid skin taut upon the asymmetrical cheekbones and the misaligned jaw. His profound hideousness was the least terrifying thing about him. I’d seen all sorts of bruised, scarred, and physically wretched people before; it was his aura of thoughtless malignance that unsettled me, that would’ve driven me away from his presence, had I seen him out in public—had I not been abruptly abducted from campus whilst walking home from class... 

We sat there for a while, silently. I had long since abandoned any hope of talking him out of it. I didn’t even know what he wanted—he hadn’t spoken a word, and ignored all attempts at communication. I was certain that I was going to die, that he was going to mutilate and kill me—it was only a matter of how. I imagined him swinging the crowbar, striking me in the head over and over, splitting my skull open and reducing the brain therein to pulp.  

Earlier, I’d seen him use the crowbar to pry open a long wooden box, and from its bottom had come skulls and other ossuary fragments. But he’d ignored them, tossing aside the cracked and dust-coated human artifacts to withdraw a crinkled piece of paper. He had studied it for a few moments, then folded it and pocketed it; spending the subsequent moments muttering insensibly to himself in a language that to me had sounded vaguely “European”, however you’d like to interpret that. He’d later nail the document to a nearby wall of the dome-shaped cave; occasionally consulting it here and there for some unspoken purpose.  

His expression still unchanged, still cryptically austere, he placed the crowbar across his lap and put both hands on the knees of his jeans. Like his grey windbreaker, they were faded, obviously old, and had sustained quite a bit of wear and tear. His boots were the only normal things about him: polished, plainly new, and this newness unsettled me. I couldn’t imagine him going out and buying a pair, had never seen him shopping anywhere in town. The box of bones behind him suggested another means of acquisition… 

The crowbar in his lap was within reach, and I considered prying my hand from the arm of my chair and reaching out for it. I’d have to sacrificed the hand, but figured I’d be able to hold onto the crowbar tight enough and for long enough to strike him at least a few times.  

He’d broken my right hand, but had only nailed the left one to its arm rest; and the nail, while long and worryingly rusted, was fairly thin, and embedded just between my pointer and middle finger—in the thin, easily torn spread of connective flesh. I wanted to do it, it wouldn’t have taken much effort to free the hand—no doubt at the cost of a tremendous amount of pain—but his almost stoic immobility held within it a level of intimidation that was so overwhelmingly disheartening. I feared what would happen if I interrupted his already unsettling dormancy.  

Finally, no longer able to bear the hope-promising light from above, I turned away from the wispy motes of dust to look at him full-on. Immediately, I cringed, seeing those two spheres of depthless darkness, windows into a mind so terribly deranged that not an iota or inkling of humanity existed therein.  

It wasn’t hatred or any conception of sentient evil behind them, but a feral, primal malevolence. I wasn’t looking at a person who was simply sick in the head, who’d once been sane or *had* held some approximation of sanity. No, this was an inhuman being, an anthropologically unclassifiable entity who had never once held any kinship with Man—civilized or otherwise.  

I got the impression that a shadow-wreathed shell sat before me, a warped vessel masquerading as a being of substance; a “man” who’d been born without a soul, or a soul that had, through some cosmic mischance, been blackened during its attachment to the body.  

I started to feel lightheaded, sick to my stomach, but couldn’t look away. There was a gravity to his gaze, a mind-draining magnetism that kept my eyes locked with his own, even as my brain sent signal after signal to turn them away. The light falling from the hole in the cave’s ceiling appeared to suddenly grow dim, and the darkness began to flicker and solidify, like shadows come to life.  

The coffin-like box of bones, now barely visible in my haze, seemed to expand behind the fiendish lunatic; growing to impossible proportions. The bones visible within also appeared to morbidly increase in size, and I began to cry as a great colossal skull loomed over me, a sepulchral leer upon its chipped and broken face.   

*He’s poisoning me with his mind, filling me with his evil sickness!* I thought to myself, struggling to turn my eyes somewhere, anywhere but there. As lucidity continued to wane, I found myself wondering when, if ever, my corpse would be discovered. The Titan’s skull had stopped growing, and as I regarded it, I noticed the agedness of it; the cracks, craters, and time-yellowed surface suggestive of decades—if not centuries—of charnel decay.  

Despair awoke in me as I realized that no one had found these remains—that I would probably join those poor unsaved souls in that damned box. Playthings of a nightmare.  

It wasn’t until the terrible hallucinations became overwhelming, suffocating, that he spoke. His voice was oddly light, soft - in total contradiction to his brutish stature and odious appearance. By degrees, with each liltingly spoken syllable, the otherworldly images faded, making way for a new and very real picture of horror.  

“I want you to watch me—as they’ve watched me. I want you to witness my rebirth. If you can stand it, if you can take it, I’ll teach you how do it.”  

Obviously, I had no idea what he was talking about, but the grave tone with which he had spoken those ominous words only served to chill me to my core, and further diminish my already depleted hope of survival.  

Without waiting for any response, he picked up the crowbar, raising it above himself and out of my reach. I thought then that he’d bring it down onto my skull, that he’d bludgeon me to death. That his wish for me to behold his rebirth was more metaphorical, than literal. *How can a corpse witness anything?*  

But he instead smashed the tool onto his own bare scalp. Once. Twice. Again and again and again, until there was a clear dent in his skull; the skin sunken and fractured, forming a bloody valley that ran down to the forehead.  

He teetered in his chair, the crowbar held suspended in mid-air, and I thought he’d surely topple over. But, with some last vestige of maddened animal strength, he delivered one final blow to himself, and the roof of his skull collapsed, just as the roof of the cave had—some decades ago. The deranged man then slumped forward, leaning lifelessly toward me, a deluge of eerily dark blood coursing from his self-inflicted wound.   

The crowbar clattered to the floor when the arm that had been holding it finally fell. But the lethally repurposed tool was out of my reach, coming to lie on the ground a few feet away.  

While I was safe for the moment, I knew that I had to relieve myself of the chair before infection set in—if it hadn’t already. Both of my hands burned from within, and I’d been sweating feverishly for quite some time—despite the pervasive chill in the air. 

Starvation and dehydration were also pressing concerns; I hadn’t eaten or drank anything in at least 48 hours—having been imprisoned within the cave for several cycles of night and day, as determined through the ceiling’s hole.  

Thankfully, the chair was simply constructed, having only a wooden frame held together by unsecured nails; it was crude, makeshift carpentry. With the need no longer as dire, I refrained from ripping the flesh between my fingers to free my nail-trapped hand, instead preferring to just break the whole chair.  

After wobbling back and forth several times, I managed to rock myself onto the ground. The left armrest broke, and with my newly freed hand I undid the leather straps that had secured my feet to the chair’s legs.  

Thus freed, I hobbled over toward the opposite end, past the opened box of bones, toward the wall where he had nailed the piece of paper. The exit—a waist-high, moss-shielded tunnel in the left wall—wasn't far off, but curiosity compelled me to investigate the piece of paper.  

I’m glad I took the time to look at it, because doing so probably saved my life.  

On the piece of paper was a diagram of a man, in what appeared to be three phases of existence. The first, a normal, seemingly healthy image. The second, a somewhat emaciated figure, long-limbed and sickly. The third, a cadaverous form, ghoulish in the face and fleshless in body; with hands like gnarled branches from which extended savagely long nails.  

Beneath each figure was a short note. The first image bore the description, “Man in his most basic.” The second: “Man undergoing the wondrous transition.” The final: “Man - Transcended. Reborn.”  

At the word reborn my attention was drawn toward the corpse in the chair—or what should’ve been a corpse. Instead, there was an animate *thing*, tremoring and shuddering as if galvanized by an electric current. One of the arms—the one that had wielded the crowbar—spasmed, and I watched, horror-stricken, as black, knife-edged nails began to grow from the spasmodically clenching hand.  

Acting on an impetus that I can only describe as an instinct to natural duty, I quickly made my way to the horrific scene. Keeping my gaze averted, I snatched up the crowbar and drove its rusted handle into the heaving, now fleshless chest of that morphing fiend.  

There a sudden glottal shriek, a few moments of bodily convulsing, and then the thing went as stiff as a statue. But somehow, I sensed a lingering life within it, an aura or emanation of some sinister, preternatural essence. I had “killed” it, but it had not necessarily died.  

Without letting my eyes turn toward his assuredly monstrous visage, I hurried past it and exited the cave.

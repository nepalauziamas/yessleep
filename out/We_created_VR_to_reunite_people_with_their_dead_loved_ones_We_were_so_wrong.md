I can't tell you the name of the company where I work, or where we're located, or even my official title. All I can tell you is that we made one of the worst mistakes a group of people possibly could. We were put in a position of power and we abused it so horribly that if there is an afterlife, which I truly doubt, none of us have even a sliver of hope to end up there. At least, not the good one.

The experiment, unfortunately, was my idea. With the growing advances in virtual reality, I was given the opportunity to create a passion project. VR was already used for games, physical therapy, connecting with others in the system. What else could I envision it being used for?

I ended up combining all three functions after remembering an older woman who used to sit at the park when I was a kid. She'd camp out on the bench near the playground and watch us all play, occasionally feeding the squirrels or the birds without much enthusiasm. One day when I was about nine years old, I ventured over to her to ask why she was there if she didn't have any kids. Obviously that was a cruel thing to ask, but I was a brash young nine year old and I had far more curiosity than tact.

She smiled thinly at me, setting her brown paper bag of birdseed next to her on the bench.

"I do have a kid," she said, her voice soft and wavering. "He's just not here right now."

"Well, where is he?"

She sighed, staring off into the distance, tears welling up in her eyes and I knew I'd said something wrong.

"I don't really know," the old lady said. "He's just not here right now."

I asked my mom about it after. Her face went sort of white, and I had the feeling if she'd been there to hear me ask the question, she would have smacked me in the mouth.

"She probably lost her son, honey."

"Like, in a store?"

My mom pinched the bridge of her nose between her thumb and forefinger and sighed deeply.

"No, hon, not in a store."

"Well then how did she--"

"For god's sake, Molly, her son died! How can you be so dense?" She slammed her hands on the kitchen table, pushed herself away from it, and left me there stunned speechless. I had always been somewhat of a difficult child, but my mother never spoke to me this way.

As an adult I now realize why she reacted the way she did. It was a complicated question, I was a dumb kid, and she could probably only think of the immeasurable pain I had caused this poor woman at the park -- after the unthinkable suffering she'd already been through. And maybe, possibly, she was wondering what it would be like to lose me too and end up on that park bench feeding the birds, watching all the other children play in ways that her own child never could again.

That story stuck with me. I've been fortunate enough not to lose anyone in my life -- not yet, anyway. By the grace of a God I don't believe in, my aunts and uncles are alive, my parents are alive, my grandparents are even still hanging on. In my 35 years I have never even attended a single funeral. So the idea of death, losing someone forever, it's always hung over me.

Maybe it's because I wish I could go back to that park and tell that old woman I'm sorry, but after that day I never saw her on the bench again.

So I sat down with my team. We planned out an extensive virtual reality program with multiple environments -- a field of flowers, a day at the beach, and at my own insistence, a park with a playground. I was aiming for this project to focus exclusively on parents who had lost children, partly because of the old lady, but also because adult interaction is far more complicated and I wasn't ready to take that on yet. Eventually, that was my goal, to work towards widowed spouses or adult siblings. But first, children had to be the focus.

We gathered our information from volunteer subjects. They were required to do something that I knew must be painful, but necessary, and gather photographs and videos of their deceased children. Anything that we could use to rebuild them in the system. To make them as realistic as possible. Between me and my assistants, Trevor and Edward, we must have accumulated over 200 hours of media of kids that no longer existed. It was hard to see, but to be truthful I didn't actually watch most of it. I just fed it into the software, like numbers into a spreadsheet.

Our first test subject was Mary, single mother, age 33. She had lost her daughter at age 7 -- not in a store, but to a car accident -- and her marriage had dissolved in the wake of their grief. We had several other options for test subjects but Mary felt right because I thought this experiment would help her the most.

When she arrived for her session, I could tell she was nervous. I did my best to assure her that while this was only a trial version of the software, we had put our best efforts into it, and her experience would help us fine-tune the performance until we could get it just right. She would have an hour to experience this virtual reality session with her daughter. I remember holding her hands, looking into her sad brown eyes, and telling her that if our calculations were as I thought they were, she would get to see her daughter again -- however imperfectly.

I regret that even more than what I asked the old lady in the park.

After a brief questionnaire, Trevor lead her into the VR chamber. It's a large white room with plenty of room to move around, no furniture, just wide open space to allow the subjects to explore their environment. When they're about to reach the edge of the room, a slight vibration hits their helmet to let them know they're almost out of range.

Did I not mention the helmet? I'm sorry. It's still hard to think about.

Trevor fit Mary with the helmet, a much larger VR headset than most of you are familiar with. It's nearly the size of an astronaut's helmet and it blocks out all light and sound so that the program can be fully immersive. Again, my idea. My stupid, shortsighted idea.

After making sure she was comfortable, Trevor left the chamber and joined Edward and I in the control room. In this room we had a simple keyboard with a large number of monitors, so we could see what the subject was seeing at every feasible angle. For safety, of course. Once the program began, we didn't intend to control much -- just any glitches that might occur, or any restarts that may be needed. And, of course, a kill switch in case things became too much.

I also made sure to fit the helmet itself with a kill switch, a small button on the right temple that the subject could press if they were feeling overwhelmed or wanted out. Unfortunately...

I'm getting ahead of myself.

Trevor, Edward, and I sat at the control panel. Mary stood in the center of the white chamber, looking around expectantly, her face hidden behind this huge helmet. She couldn't wait for the program to begin. Truth be told, I couldn't either.

Before me on the screen was a blinking green button that read "START." My heart seemed to beat in time with each blink. I took a deep breath.

"Here we go, boys," I said, and clicked the mouse, hitting the start button.

The screens suddenly switched on, displaying a huge field of beautiful pink tulips, something like you'd see in the Netherlands. The sky was an almost unnatural shade of blue -- I immediately made a note on my notepad, writing that the saturation of colors needed to be toned down. The clouds were huge and white and puffy, and though those didn't look quite right either, I didn't note that. Clouds didn't always look totally natural, and almost looked better when they didn't.

In the corner of the screen, a timer counted down from one hour.

Mary's body looked around the chamber. Mary's avatar looked around the field of flowers. And then...

Out of the field, a little girl came running. I recognized her right away as Mary's daughter Elaine, a little girl of 7 with short blondeish hair and big brown eyes. She was smiling so wide, and as soon as Mary saw her, she clapped both hands to her mouth.

"Hi, Mommy!" Elaine's avatar cried, throwing her arms out for a hug.

Mary stared at her. She crouched down, slowly, and put her arms out too.

The one part I had regretted in the moment was that we couldn't program in any sort of physical touch. But I had warned her about this -- that any kind of physical interaction would have to be imagined.

It didn't seem to matter. Mary mimed a hug and Elaine's avatar embraced hers warmly. Mary was shaking; I could see it in her arms, her legs. Tears stung my eyes but I blinked them away, hoping that my assistants couldn't see.

"Hi, baby," Mary sobbed, and sank further down onto her knees. I'll admit, the VR was almost unnervingly real compared to the few videos and photos I'd seen of Elaine. There was no uncanny valley here; from what we could see on the screen, Mary may as well have been seeing her dead daughter for the first time in 4 years.

Elaine's avatar smiled and pulled back from the hug. There was the first disconnect I saw; she pulled back but Mary was still embracing her because she couldn't feel the withdrawal. But it didn't last long as she looked up at her daughter's avatar, still smiling, tears streaming down her neck even with the helmet stopping most of them at her cheeks.

"I missed you," she said, and Trevor put a hand on my shoulder.

"We did it," he murmured, but I shushed him.

"Not yet."

Mary tried to speak, sobbed again, then paused and composed herself. She tried to wipe her tears, only to be stopped by the helmet, which I found an unbearably sad thing to witness. But she didn't let it break her.

"I missed you too, Ellie," she said. "So, so much. You'll never know how much."

"Don't cry, Mommy," Elaine's avatar said, and spun around in a circle. "Come play with me!"

I don't want to share what happened in the next hour, because I don't feel that's my place. All I'll say is that Mary and Elaine's avatar made up for lost time. The vibration in the helmet did a fairly good job of stopping her before she reached the edge -- though Mary did still bump into it a few times. It didn't take her long to recognize the space, though, and the session seemed to be going remarkably well. I made dutiful notes while Edward made minor adjustments to the system whenever we noticed a small flicker or glitch of unreality.

As the hour came to a close, I did what I had been dreading most -- to tell Mary the program was almost over. I hit a button to speak through the speaker in her helmet.

"Mary," I said gently, "Your session is almost over. I'm sorry, but it's time to say goodbye."

Mary, who had been sitting on the white floor cradling a daughter who wasn't really there, looked up frantically.

"No, please," she begged, "I need more time, please, I need more time."

Before I could say anything else, Elaine's avatar suddenly stood up.

"You can't leave, Mommy," she said, distraught. Her brown eyes began to well up with virtual tears. "If you leave, I'll die all over again."

Mary let out a broken sob, and my breath caught in my throat.

"What the fuck?" I said, releasing the microphone button. I looked to Edward and Trevor, slightly panicked. "She shouldn't be saying that. Why would she say that?"

Edward looked away from me. Trevor swallowed, then looked me straight in the eyes.

"I programmed it in. If this is something we can monetize, we need the parents to keep coming back."

"What the fuck do you mean monetize? What do you mean keep coming back?!" I reached for the microphone button but Trevor stopped me.

"The company wants to turn this into a business, Molly. If they get closure on the first session they won't be repeat customers. We need them to want to come back."

"I never agreed to this!" I exclaimed, and Edward muttered, "Yeah, you weren't in those meetings."

In the chamber, Mary was hugging desperately at the air.

"No, baby, I won't leave, don't worry, I won't leave!"

“I don’t want to die again, Mommy,” Elaine whimpered. Now they were both crying.

"Get her out of there," I said, reaching for another button, and when Trevor tried to stop me again I shoved him away with a surprising amount of strength. I hit the kill switch.

Nothing happened.

"What the fuck, did you program this in too?" I demanded. I hit the kill switch over and over again. The screens stayed on. In the chamber, Mary was hugging the air, but on the screens, she was hugging Elaine, who looked like she'd never let go.

"I -- no, the kill switch should still work," Trevor stammered. He got up from the floor and started hammering the same button I'd been hitting.

"I'll never leave, I won't leave, I'll never leave," Mary began sobbing, and suddenly all the screens went dark.

\---

It's been three days now. The doors of the chamber, for some reason, won't unlock. Mary won't take off the helmet. In fact, she won't do anything. She hasn't asked for food, or water, or anything. She's been relieving herself anywhere she can in the room, and she's running out of spots, but without food or water she won't necessarily need them anymore.

She doesn't even seem to be interacting with the avatar much either, though if she were we couldn't see it. We can't get the screens back on. She just laughs weakly once in a while, or moves her hands just a little bit. Sometimes she murmurs but I can't make out what she's saying.

We've called in higher-ups to look at the software, the power supply, but no one has been of any help. I've begged for them to call for someone to open the doors, but I think they're afraid of legal repercussion, since apparently the releases Mary signed didn't actually go anywhere or mean anything. It was just something Trevor drew up on the fly to look official.

I've been told to go home. That there's nothing I can do. But I feel like I have to stay. I have to watch, and hope that Elaine's avatar will let go of its hold on her. I've been running every script I can think of to undo what Trevor had done, but the program won't let itself be changed.

Maybe that's the cost of playing God. And if that's the case, then I, just like God, have to watch what I have wrought on the innocent.

At least, I suppose, she didn't choose the park.

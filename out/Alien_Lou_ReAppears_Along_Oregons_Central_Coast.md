  

**UFO “Lou” Dies and then lives again:** *This special new journalism report is in tribute to Lou’s memory that is a bright light for those who want to believe here out West; while “Lou” has been spotted walking the central Oregon coast beaches during early days of September 2022… Does Lou Live?*

Lou always said “we are not alone in the universe!” His vibe was linked to new discoveries that reveal we’re not alone because “the friends” are watching us, he said. Lou said there’s “more than 5,000 confirmed planets with “human life,” while also noting that there are more than 200 billion stars in the Milky Way or at least 30 billion spots in space where life is taking hold. For those “seeking the light,” he’s a god-send. There is a recent memory when Lou came onstage at the recent UFO Festival alone, barefoot, in his famed rainbow robe embroidered in red, blue, gold and silver, hanging with a bright crystal. Softly, Lou moved side to side and spoke of End Times in 2019. And then something “really” strange happened. Lou stopped talking and sat down and died this June 24, 2019. While Lou now be gone, this weird old 100-year-old self-proclaimed hybrid alien human man’s consciousness is alive and well in 2019 with the collective consciousness of these brave UFO “Watchers” at Brays Point, Oregon, continues because “we all now share Lou’s collective consciousness with ‘the friends’ and we will never be the same,” said Errol, the now senior “watcher” in the wake of Lou’s sad passing. This special “new journalism” e-book spotlights essays that help explain the Who, What, When, Where, Why and How of Lou and these UFO “watchers” here at Brays Point, Oregon, in June 2019.

**LOU’S QUOTES**

We are not alone, said Lou!

He said there is proof positive that a “cigar-shaped (Oumuamua) alien spacecraft” has been sent to Earth for unknown reasons, according to famed Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb*.* The professor detailed how aliens “did send this asteroid (spacecraft?) and I won’t back down!” 

He revealed this “proof” recently in an official statement; while also explaining how this “Oumuamua may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth vicinity by an alien civilization.” Oumuamua is the Hawaiian word for “scout” or “messenger.” 

This “Oumuamua” was first discovered back in October 2017 by NASA telescopes; while at the time this alien spacecraft or cigar-shaped rock formation is said to be about 400 meters long (1,300 fee) and about 130 feet wide. 

According to “Lou,” the self-proclaimed hybrid alien leader of this “watchers” group at Brays Point, “the Friends visit Brays Point and other ‘hot spots’ regularly; while Lou is in contact with Professor Loeb and concurred that Loeb’s sightings concur with like alien spacecraft sightings recently in early 2019 at Brays Point. 

At the same time, Professor Loeb thinks this “interstellar object” that he’s dubbed “Oumuamua” is actually a probe being sent to Earth by alien beings because, as Lou often points out, “our planet Earth is burning due to unchecked climate change and raging human hate.” 

Loeb is the Frank B. Baird, Jr. Professor of Science at Harvard University who has written several books and published more than 700 scholarly papers at Harvard’s Center for Astrophysics on why he believes we are not alone in the universe; while aliens are here now walking among us. Professor Loeb and UFO “watchers” here at Brays Point know that this alien probe “was sent to us by an advanced civilization.” The professor shared his theory that, “Its origin could be either natural (in the interstellar medium or proto-planetary disks) or artificial per NASA often sends probes into deep space to hunt for ET and other planetary reconnaissance.” While Professor Loeb’s theory and claims about this being a possible “alien ship” sent to Earth makes perfect sense to Brays Point UFO “watchers” (\*who often say they’ve witnessed the “hand of God” in the night sky), there are many odious Trump-types who only believe in their own lies and deceptions and call Professor Loeb’s theory “fake news.” This special “new journalism” Kindle e-book report spotlights those who believe alien life visiting Earth is real; while essays explore the Who, What, When, Where, Why and How of Professor Loeb’s belief that aliens are watching Earth right now in 2019!

A spaceship, still visible in the night sky over Brays Point (\*recently after Lou’s passing) was moving to the east when local “watchers” took a snapshot that convinced this reporter to consider what’s happening here is not good. This somewhat innocent story sounds like another UFO sighting on the surface, but there’s something more going on that’s significant to anyone worried about climate change heralding End Times. 

For example, nothing lasts and resulting UFO “destruction” is now being predicted by famed UFO hunter Roger Hokusai of Tokyo, Japan. The ET expert doesn’t mix words when pointing to the existence of extraterrestrial intelligent life here at Brays Point, Oregon. 

Hokusai, 78, recently visited the site featured on the cover of this special “new journalism” report because the old man says there’s “strange noises, smells and reflections of exobiology light that cannot be ignored in this time when UFO sightings and occurrences are off-the-chart. These warns of destruction are not spoken or placed on banners so all the world can see; but contained in the rise of climate change globally and certainly with all these wild fires out West in America right now in August 2019.” 

Hokusai has researched the concept of extraterrestrial life for decades; while admitting that Japan’s massive 9.1 earthquake on March 11, 2011 (\*and resulting Tsunami that raced across the Pacific Ocean smashing this region of the Oregon coast) got him to thinking about climate change cause and effect, and how aliens visiting planet Earth may be linked? “I suppose science can explain such things, but depending on the category of ET search, and methods, we don’t really know how much influence aliens are having on our lives and our planet.” This musing influenced Hokusai’s recent visit to Brays Point and this mysterious Pacific Ocean dock that’s the UFO hunter says, “Is still oozing signs of life with a wide range of possibilities that this was a UFO landing site and it ‘feels’ to me that UFO destruction is being predicted. 

Certainly, there are signs in Mother Nature that unless we are contacted soon by this super-intelligent extraterrestrial life, we will be toast because climate change doom and gloom is here now with most environmentalists thinking all is lost.” 

Brays Point, Oregon, was first recognized as a UFO sighting location back on May 11, 1950 when flying saucers were sighted over nearby McMinnville, Oregon, outside of Portland. “The alien spacecraft sighting back then just increased with space ships seen hovering over a coastal dock area that’s long been gripped by alien abductions; while most locals around Brays Point swear they are not alone anymore,” said local Maggie Frazer, 78, who describes the aliens she’s seen up close and personal as “looking like us, human, but with a really pale skin color and unusual almond-shaped eyes that are as black as coal and somewhat frightening.” 

Frazier says she and other Brays Point locals now communicate “telepathically” with their so-called “friends” who share “really grave warnings about climate change and other glimpses into their really strange and colorful multidimensional world that is both wondrous and really weird because I cannot explain it properly,” adds the old woman with fear on her face.

At the same time, the watchers often talk about a recent view of famed astronaut and U.S. Senator John Glenn being paired with an alien mask was created by UFO “watchers” here at Brays Point, Oregon, during a Feb. 6, 2019 question and answer press conference to address known UFO Extraterrestrial (ET) life proof in the wake of alien spacecraft visiting Brays Point and other regions of Earth and neighboring planets in what local UFO “watcher” experts view as “patterns of worry and anticipation that ‘the friends’ are near for good reason. 

Former Astronaut John Glenn, who died in 2017 at age 95, appeared on the TV show “Frasier” as himself; while revealing his belief that “aliens are real here now on Earth.” During Glenn’s career as a U.S. senator he often asserted publically that the federal government must take UFOs seriously or risk a “First Contact” that could be disastrous for people on Earth. Moreover, Glenn said he saw three alien spacecraft in the Earth’s atmosphere when piloting his Mercury “Friendship 7” spacecraft back in 1962. 

Fast forward some 57 years and Glenn’s prediction that ET spacecraft will make First Contact is now realized, said famed Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb who revealed in 2018 that “a cigar-shaped rock” was traveling through the solar system at great speed and headed for Earth. As chairman of Harvard’s internationally famous astronomy department, it is huge news in UFO “watcher” circles for Professor Loeb to state publically on Feb. 5, 2019 that the human race is not only not alone in the universe, and that the alien spacecraft open is no more than 1mm (0.03 inches) think and a kilometer long as a possible “ship sail” via sunlight is pushing this alien spacecraft in and out of our solar system; while there’s real fear here at Brays Point that ‘the friends’ may not be friendly in terms of known aliens “the Friends” may not be linked to this proof a an alien spacecraft monitoring Earth today in 2019.

**Critical Thinking**

***UFO “Lou” Dies*** ***spotlight****s* ***visitors to Brays Point, Oregon, who note the following from Genesis 1:3 that are hand-carved in a mighty Douglas Fir tree outside the nondescript deep woods lair of the famed UFO “watcher” leader, and self-proclaimed hybrid alien “Lou.” Visitors say “there’s something in the air around Brays Point “that feels alien.”*** 

***“IN THE BEGINNING GOD CREATED THE HEAVEN AND THE EARTH.*** ***AND THE EARTH WAS WITHOUT FORM, AND VOID; AND DARKNESS WAS UPON THE FACE OF THE DEEP.*** ***AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD MOVED UPON THE FACE OF THE WATERS.*** ***AND GOD SAID, ‘LET THERE BE LIGHT: AND THERE WAS LIGHT.’”***

The people who visit the famed UFO sighting location at Brays Point, Oregon, on Feb. 6, 2019 are in for a “mind-melding visual treat,” say the local UFO “watchers group” because here at ***Latitude*****: 44 14' 20.4" (44.239) north;** ***Longitude*****: 124 6' 38.4" (124.1107**) ‘the friends’ will visit.

According to this Brays Point UFO watchers group, the local environment has degraded to such a frightening degree that “we’re not at all surprised this alien spacecraft continues to appear nearby in the deep Pacific waters off of Brays Point. This is where our UFO ‘friends’ appear almost nightly to let us know the End is Nie; the end of life as we know it on planet Earth is approaching its end,” add members of the Brays Point UFO watcher group now busy as bees preparing their special vantage points for throngs of UFO fans expecting to commune with alien life.

This magical treatise invites those who believe or do not believe in UFOs and alien life here on Earth to explore and experience Brays Point when visiting the central Oregon coast. This collection of new journalism essays is based on extensive research at Brays Point over the past 17 years; while also featuring recent data on the mysterious “metal boxes” unearthed over the years after Brays Point UFO sightings. 

The descriptions of the UFO watchers (\*who visit and inhabit this very strange spit of coastal land at the furthest point West on the continental US) say the visual and spiritual impact of regular UFO sightings at Brays Point “can be felt in this hauntingly beautiful landscape where the geography, geology, flora and fauna are all changed in a magical sort of way as if this is really a heaven here on Earth.” 

The aim of this collection of new journalism reports and essays is to inform and entertain readers who are intrigued about this forthcoming Solar Eclipse and regular UFO sightings here at Brays Point. At the same time, there is a driving sense of purpose linked to the timing and location of last year’s Solar Eclipse having its Genesis here at this popular UFO viewing spot. 

This is not a “UFO tale,” said Lou. “This is real-life out of balance with nature; while it’s happening now deep within the Pacific Ocean here at the mysterious UFO sighting spot known internationally as Brays Point.”

***When famed nature author Jack London visited the central Oregon coast back in 1911 to write “The Cruise of the Snark,” London noted “strange bright lights from the night sky over a stretch of the Oregon coast near Florence that seems spooky to me?”*** ***Local historians point to London staying in a nondescript central Oregon coast beach house between Florence and Yachats, Oregon, known as “the cape of UFOs” at Brays Point.*** ***It so happens that near to the summer home (\*where London wrote The Cruise of the Snark back during the summer of 1911) that Oregon writer Ken Kesey lived in his Brays Point beach home nearby between the late Sixties until Kesey’s passing on Nov. 10, 2001.*** ***Both Kesey and London produced journals that explained their deep love and respect for the nature in and around their summer homes at Brays Point where the Aug. 21, 2017 Solar Eclipse began.***

Jack London’s reaction to environmental destruction in and around his San Francisco home and later down the Oregon coast at Brays Point gives fans an insider view of a true red, white and blue environmentalist who viewed those like Donald Trump denying climate destruction “rich fools who have no place ruining life for good hard working folk.” 

London’s visit to the central Oregon coast and Brays Point during the summer of 1911 not only helped him sort out ideas about writing aboard ship for this famed book, “The Cruise of the Snark,” but it also opened London’s eyes to environmental crimes being committed by big shipping business out West at the turn of the 20th century.

“There is a fascinating vignette of the early 20th century with Jack London writing in a style that we would today dub as ‘environmentally green’ because London held your attention with story after story about toxic fuel oil and other ship debris being dumped into the Pacific Ocean and nearby waterways and dock areas all ‘so the rich business owners can maximize their profits,’ wrote London in a June 1911 era ‘letter to the editor’ in nearby Portland, Oregon,” explained retired “new journalism” radio reporter Isaac Maggs during a recent anti-Trump protest relating to America pulling out of the Paris Climate Change Accord.

Maggs, 75, quipped “I lived this long on the radio to witness our own president shooting the nation in the foot by withdrawing from our only real shot at stopping climate change. What the heck was Donald Trump thinking when he removed our nation from the Paris Climate Change Agreement? Is it greed, or Trump wanting to thumb his billionaire bully nose at those with a heart and a sense of doing the right thing for the next generation who will surely have to deal with this unchecked and dangerous climate change situation?”

At the same time, Maggs recalls “back in the day of Watergate when the real stinker was our own President Tricky Dick Nixon who demanded loyalty from people in government as if he thought being president makes one a king with impunity? Not! No, Nixon got impeached just like Trump will be impeached because no president has the right to demand such loyalty when the president himself serves the people.” Maggs says he brings up Trump’s demand for loyalty during this post-People’s Climate March anti-Trump protest environment because “you see a president who is dishonest doesn’t care about such things as the health and safety of the people when he denies climate change. This dishonesty of Trump is why we are not in solidarity with the rest of the world who support the Paris Climate Change Agreement as our best start at fighting this loss of our environment to greedy and evil fossil fuel fans like Trump and his Republican partners in crime.”

**An Introductory Note**

***UFO “Lou” Dies*** ***is first you have to know that “the day the Sun disappears over the famed UFO sighting location here at Brays Point, Oregon, there will be ‘signs’ from ‘the friends’ that more is coming to planet Earth.”***

During a recent Brays Point lecture in the wake of the recent People’s Climate Change anti-Trump protests, and Donald Trump ending America’s involvement in the Paris Climate Change Agreement, Professor Ned Tucker shared views about the lines between the blur of climate change fear and “real news” being messed with by the Trump administration and Republicans wanting to make more money from promoting fossil fuels. 

“Yes, it’s true, these Republicans say who cares about current climate change dangers because there’s big money to be made fracking, pumping more oil and gas out of the ground and burning the heck out of coal for what, old times sake? I mean it’s as evil as all get out,” added the professor with a deep sense of chagrin about a sitting president “who has never been honest with the people, and this is especially true when it comes to Trump denying climate change.”

As for the forthcoming Solar Eclipse off of Brays Point, the old man says he’s pleased that “our area will get some attention and more tourist visiting to view the start of this Eclipse, but I fear there is this weird thing with some people today who just cannot get their head around the fact that we’re not alone in the universe and, yes, we have been are being visited by beings from other planets and realms that are way beyond our ability to understand.”

***The professor viewed the 2018 Solar Eclipse with “Lou” and other UFO “watcher” friends here at their famed special vantage point pictured on the cover of this e-book.***

With each anti-Trump climate change march and rally it is clear that the evil that men do to our environment stops with odious evil types like Trump and Republicans who are hell-bent on making money at the expense of destroying the environment, say People’s Climate March supporters sharing views with this “new journalism” reporter for this special Solar Eclipse report.

In this hour of world darkness, those willing to “unplug” from the tech machine can find real peace of mind and wisdom in nature.

“The hardest action to take as a leader, as a parent, as a politician, as a priest, whatever it is, is the one that prevents the bad thing,” said Vice President Joe Biden during a recent TV interview. 

As for the “bad thing,” Biden said all of mankind now must deal with cold soul and broken hearted people online and in world torn apart by fear, hate, terrorism and war.

E.M. FORSTER WROTE “THE MACHINE STOPS” TO WARN PEOPLE TO “TURN OFF THE MACHINE, AND GET OUT IN NATURE OR LOSE ONE’S MIND.”

Meanwhile, the famed American environmental activist and poet Wendell Berry thinks anyone in pain can “cherish what remains of the Earth” so as to “foster its renewal as our only legitimate hope of survival.”

Berry, 81, also told this “new journalism” reporter that he was influenced by Henry David Thoreau’s call for humans to “simply, simply, simply” and seek out true peace of mind outside in one’s local environment.

Berry was so moved when visiting this furthest point West on the continental US (\*pictured here with this report) that he recited his famed poem:

**THE PEACE OF WILD THINGS**

**“When despair for the world grows in me**

**and I wake in the night at the least sound**

**in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be,**

**I go and lie down where the wood drake**

**rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.**

**I come into the peace of wild things**

**who do not tax their lives with forethought**

**of grief. I come into the presence of still water.**

**And I feel above me the day-blind stars**

**waiting with their light. For a time**

&#x200B;

**I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.”**

**Credo**

***UFO “Lou” Dies*** ***reflects the People’s Climate March of exposing the dishonesty of the Trump administration when it comes to Trump lies about no climate change.*** ***Thus, the “credo” is to “always protect the environment because it’s the air we breathe and the water we drink, while also being the planet we leave for our children and our children’s children.*** ***“Donald Trump is a man of greed and hate, and he simply removed America from the Paris Climate Change Agreement because he can and because he’s all ate up inside when it comes to hating the achievements of President Obama and those liberals and others who view that planet as for all the people regardless of wealth or status in society,” explained a passionate mother and grandmother and UFO fan Tina Bailey-Sauer.*** 

When it comes to fighting for planet Earth, mother and grandmother Tina Bailey-Sauer is there big time to make sure “we all fight Trump and those crazy Republicans wanting to deny climate change dangers today in 2019.” 

The retired nurse went on to explain how “the environment being so unpredictable and toxic that climate deniers don’t get we are all getting sick in our bodies and minds because the water we drink and the air we breathe is no longer safe.”

Bailey-Sauer, 65, says a “good president” would provide citizenry with “feedback on how our country is fighting climate change; while with Trump there is nothing. This president has nothing in terms of proclaiming, as we do, that ‘Water is Life!’ And, there is so much life to protect in nature that it hurts all our hearts to have to participate in the recent Women’s March on Washington and People’s Climate Change anti-Trump protests because our own president and the Republican controlled Congress are our worst enemies in terms of destroying the environment.”

The mother and grandmother then cried. Her credo is to “please help safe planet Earth.”

At the same time, SETI experts are studying “flashes of alien UFO lights” detected at this furthest west location on the continental United States at Brays Point, announced the self-proclaimed hybrid alien known as “Lou.”

However, at the same time the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) experts, such as famed 84-year-old Astronomer Frank Drake and other UFO sighting fans have been deterred by a recent Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) announcement that the Pacific Coast, Highway 101, near Brays Point will be closed off for needed “slide repairs” now at the end of 2014. 

“This means stay away, because we do not want UFO sighting fans – who often visit our ‘watchers’ group – to be injured now that this region around Brays is under construction by ODOT,” explained Lou during a brief announcement Sept. 12, 2014.

It is known that this SETI project - to try and sort out the regular evening “light shows” over the vast Pacific Ocean and cliffs – involves the use of “various scientific methods” to monitor signs of “electromagnetic radiation” that is often found in alien transmissions from other worlds that Lou says “have already contacted us and are here now. The ‘friends’ are with us.”

During a recent National Geographic interview to decry SETI funding being “mostly dried up, the Astronomer Frank Drake, who is internationally famous for his Drake equation                      and is credited for helping to found the science of astrobiology when searching for radio signals from alien civilizations in the Sixties here at Brays Point, said the best shot at “connecting” with the ‘friends’ is to analyze “light signals” of extraterrestrial intelligence.

In brief, the Drake equation is Frank Drake’s equation to “estimate the number of active, communicative extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy.” For instance, anyone who has ventured to the very edge of the sharp cliffs at Brays Point can experience the many natural factors that contribute to what Drake calls as “flashes of alien lights” over Brays Point. 

SETI’S NEW PROJECT IS TO DETECT “FLASHES OF LIGHT, RATHER THAN RADIO TRANSMISSIONS, FROM ALIEN CIVILIZATIONS. IT’S WISE TO TRY EVERY POSSIBLE APPROACH BECAUSE WE’RE NOT VERY GOOD AT PSYCHING OUT WHAT THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS MIGHT BE DOING,” EXPLAINED DRAKE DURING AN INTERVIEW THAT APPEARED IN THE JULY 2014 EDITION OF NATIONAL GEORGRAPHIC MAGAZINE.

In turn, National Geographic headlines proclaimed how “Frank Drake is still looking for extraterrestrial signals, a discovery that would trump everything else.”

Moreover, Lou points to the “flashes of light” SETI testing over Brays Point as “nothing new” because Nikola Tesla did the same thing back in 1896 when he used a wireless electrical transmission system that Tesla said he used to “contact beings on Mars.”

According to an official biography of Tesla, he observed “repetitive light signals, substantially very different from the signals found in Earth noise or storms.”

In turn, a group of SETI astrobiologists – who braved ODOT’s recent closure of access to the “watcher” outposts along Brays Point’s cliff areas near Ken Kesey’s summer home – are currenting investigating the possibility that the “flashes of light” that Drake is also investigating – are indeed communications from aliens.

Also, the famed French government COMETA report links these “flashes of light” at Brays Point to what SETI researchers view as the next step after focusing mostly on biosignatures and other signs of life on other far off worlds

Lou thinks this SETI focus on Brays Point and its popular “flashes of alien light” is a good thing because “the world needs hope from above right now.” Meanwhile, a snow-chilled wind that blew Lou’s multi-colored cape over his head, reminds both Lou and his UFO “watcher” group that “change is in the air,” as more bright lights crack the Brays Point skies apart on just another day here on the very edge of the continent.

***Moreover, talk of ancient signals becomes real when viewing this strange yellow grid appeared on Lou’s old marble slab seemed disarmingly alien.***

When the self-proclaimed hybrid alien known to the local Brays Point “watchers” group as simply “Lou,” the words this strange old man speaks often comes with the sound of the tinkle of ice cubes, a sweet sound coming deep from the forest where Lou resides in a nondescript log cabin with no electricity amongst the roar of absolute silence when he is not around.

When enjoying nature here at the furthest point west on the continental U.S., Lou points to an “ancient signal” that simply looks like a grid to say “we have found something useful to explain these end times.”

Lou claims to be in his nineties, and says “I am reaching my end that will come at age 100.”

In turn, there is a message Lou wishes to share in the form of a letter he wrote to himself 50 years ago on Sept. 10, 1964.

The letter begins thusly:

“Dear 100-year-old me, no matter how many millions may be congregated into great cities like Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles, there is nothing inherently impossible or even improbable about these and other places escaping the end times in early 2015. Perhaps, in the revolutions of the world, Brays Point may be safe where chanting UFO ‘watchers’ wait before the world is ended; while our ‘watchtower’ will be as it was as the elements of earth, wind, sea, clouds, sky are ever with us.”

LOU EXPLAINS “MESSENGERS FROM WITHIN”

“Yes, I talk with alien beings, with angels, with great ‘friends’ (aliens) whose presence infuse and create events in nature that cannot be easily explained to modern man,” writes Lou. “In another time and culture I might have been cloistered in a temple, or, less pleasantly, thought to be a worrisome wizard. In this highly skeptical time any claim that I am ‘hybrid’ is more likely to be met with scoffing disbelief.”

Still, Lou claims his “human mother” lives in small French hamlet “where people as live long as the hardy bushes and grasses that require little moisture or nourishment, but somehow thrive and live on. We are not born to die young, but live on after the ‘Change.’”

BRAYS POINT IS ONE OF “333” SO-CALLED “CENTERS” THAT ARE ACTUALLY GROWING UP EVERWHERE. LOU SAYS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A NEW KIND OF MONASTERY OR OR ISLANDS OF SAFETY WHERE HUMAN & HYBRID ALIEN HISTORY CAN BE REMEMBERED AND CONTINUE TO FUNCTION AFTER THE “CHANGE” THAT IS FORTCOMING.

While all of this sounds to the layman like pie in the sky, Lou says “you do not have to believe me, but just look at the signs and ancient signals that this ‘Change’ is in the air and it won’t be long now before the world realizes that the ‘Change’ is at hand.”

In other words, Lou is talking about a type of underground which existed during the Dark Ages in a much different way along the mystical orders of believers who wanted to preserve the “light” that is clearly evident each evening here at Brays Point when Lou’s “friends” shine a multitude of bright glowing lights in the night sky that means “do not worry,” adds Lou with a rare sneer on his face.

Still, the local “watchers” UFO group here at Brays Point has enough on its plate with its 120 plus members already getting “a lot of hell whenever we share our UFO sighting news with others outside the circle of watchers,” says elder watcher Errol with a deep sense of chagrin.

“There is a certain poetry in the way seagulls and other sea birds react to the ‘friends’ when the lights start to shine. It’s as if you can go through a looking-glass into another kind of perception, in which you have that pure sense of being united to all beings and things on this Earth,” adds Lou, while adding: “When this happens you can suddenly understand everything.”

While Star Trek’s Mr. Spock was the original hybrid alien, the being known as “Lou” says unlike this fictional TV character he is the real deal just like the ongoing terrorism threat that hit America hard some 13 years ago.

“Mr. Spock would say it is ‘most illogical that human beings do not forgive easily when we know that is what the Creator wants us to do – to always forgive,” explained Lou. 

Meanwhile, Lou and the local UFO “watchers” group is taking to heart what President Obama told the world last night when explaining that ISIS is the successor to al-Qaeda.

“This means what we do here at Brays Point as ‘watchers’ must be something that every American should do on a daily basis; and that is to ‘watch’ what’s going down around us,” explained Lou, while praising his team of more than 120 “watchers” who not only scan the night sky and horizon for alien lights, but other alien threats in the guise of terrorists.

For instance, this Brays Point group of volunteers - known for more than five decades as the “watchers” - are a spin-off of coastal patriots who manned this same ancient Native American fortress at the furthest point west on the continental US to warn of invasion by Japanese forces during World War II. 

“A LONG-RANGE JAPANESE SUBMARINE SHELLED THE OREGON COAST IN SEPTEMBER 1942; WHILE JAPANESE SEAPLANES DROPPED BOMBS ON THE OREGON COAST LATER IN 1942 AND 1943,” STATES THE NATIONAL ARCHIEVES IN ITS HISTORY OF WORLD WAR II ON THE US HOMEFRONT.

In fact, “watcher” elder Errol says his father served as a member of Oregon’s first line of defense during World War II. Errol then produces something called “The Observer’s Prayer,” that included the warning from Oregon’s Aircraft Warning Service that asserted: “A Sleep Head Will Wake-Up Dead.”

“Oh Lord, give us the ears to hear, the eyes to see, that Japanese Zero if he tries to hide among the clouds. And if he does come, give us the heart to forgive the poor misguided soul who does not realize what he has done.”

Lou often tells his “watcher” mates that it is not impossible to forgive these terrorists for what they did on September 11 because it is not our call but the Creator who rules by forgiveness that holds the universe together. The continuation of the human species is due to mankind’s ability to forgive evil throughout its history.”

Still, Lou says our own fragile universe here on Earth is at risk due to the “Change” that is now at hand.

ON THIS 13TH ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11, LOU ASKS THAT ALL BEINGS “FORGIVE YOURSELF AND FORGIVE OTHERS.”

“Our future is nigh, that is for sure. Yet, we can still harness the most powerful force in the universe and that is love and forgiveness. Whatever evil comes down, it always falls to love coming around again and again throughout mankind’s history,” the wise 90-something Lou explained on a bright and sunny Sept. 11 morning.

In turn, Errol read from an ancient Native American text unearthed at Brays Point that “basically says we will know the end times by ‘great lights in the sky,’ and ‘twelve legions of angels,’ in what our Native American ancestors describe as a forthcoming ‘ultimate power struggle for the universe.’”

While Lou says forgiveness is a prominent theme in the Bible, people “do not forgive when they say ‘I forgive, but don’t forget.’ They say that because the act of forgiving does not come easy for ego-driven humans with a very human instinct to recoil in self-protection when they are injured physically or mentally.”

Overall, Lou says “we all understand the brokenness of the human condition as we still grieve on this 13th anniversary of 9/11. Yet, it is not me saying you should forgive, but the Creator who demands forgiveness. This is not negotiable.”

Thus, it is difficult to ignore the Bible verse: “If you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.”

I run a private campground.  I’ve been telling you about it for a while now.  About the things that live here, about my own family history, and a little bit about the locals and my employees.  I try to keep those details scarce, however, for while I am comfortable sharing most of my life with all of you, I feel I should respect the privacy of others.  And while I’m sure you would love to know more about the old sheriff or Bryan or any of the others, I appreciate that you also respect their privacy and don’t pry.  Besides, there’s usually [other interesting things to hear about](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lmd9o2/how_to_survive_camping_i_solve_my_problems_with/).

Well… I can finally tell you about Bryan and his dogs.  I think it’s okay now.  I don’t think he’ll mind.

It's a sad story and it starts and ends with animal cruelty.  Not just an animal dying.  Cruelty.  I wanted to warn you.

Bryan has always been quiet, to my memory.  We’re close in age and were only a grade apart in school.  I don’t recall seeing him much, nor hearing about him, until he got his dogs.  They began following him to school when they were in that awkward stage between puppy and adult, their paws still slightly too large for their bodies.  They’d wait at the edge of the schoolyard for him to visit them during recess and then after school let out, they’d surround him and they’d all walk home together.

It didn’t take long for adults to notice.  Our principal got on the announcements one day and warned everyone to stay away from the dogs.  I didn’t think much of it at the time, but I wonder what it was like for Bryan, sitting in his classroom with the principal over the PA telling all of his classmates to stay away from his dogs.  He must have felt the weight of all those eyes on him.  No wonder he never talked much.

I remember the principal coming by to confer with my parents.  We were told to stay in our rooms and do our homework.  I, of course, climbed out through my window and snuck around the side of the house to listen in, hiding against the wall under the kitchen window.  The dogs, the principal was saying, were clearly unnatural.  He sounded offended at the very thought.

“So what if they are?” my dad replied.  “They’re obviously attached to Bryan and dogs - even unnatural ones - are loyal to their masters.  I don’t see a problem here.”

“But they follow him to school!”

“Is there going to be a need for the dogs to defend Bryan while he’s *at school*?”

My father’s voice had gone soft, as it did when he was making a threat.  It wasn’t even the tone of voice he used right before I got sent to the yard to chop wood for a while.  It was reserved for the adults around town, a warning that they should choose their next words carefully, for while my father was gentle and kind he was also the kind of man that had mercy-killed his own father.

The principal did not reply.  I remained crouched there, heart hammering in excitement.  I liked hearing the principal get his come-uppance for no other reason than he was in authority over me and I didn’t like him on principle.

“As I said,” my father finally said with an air of finality, “I don’t see a problem here.”

After that no one bothered Bryan.  The other students left him alone.  They left his dogs alone as well.  I attempted to befriend them, briefly, but gave up when I realized the dogs had no interest in me.  They’d let me pet them, there on the edge of the playground, but their eyes would be fixed at the drab brick walls of the school building, intently staring at their master that sat somewhere beyond.

Then we grew up.  I left for college.  Bryan didn’t.  And when I returned that first summer of my freshman year, he was working at the campground and the dogs were with him.  I’m not sure if my parents hired him because no one else wanted to, on account of the dogs, or if they hoped that having some unnatural hounds around would make the camp safer.  Probably both reasons.

That is everything I can tell you from what I personally know.  Everything past this point was told to me by Bryan’s mother.

Byran was prone to going off on his own as a child.  He’d vanish into the woods and not come back until dinnertime.  His mother didn’t mind, so long as he got his homework done.

Then the dogs started coming around.

They’d only come at night, at first.  She’d see them through the window, slinking along the edges of the yard, just where the forest swallowed up the light from the house.  Their eyes shone like stars and she knew that these were not normal dogs.  She hoped they would move along on their own, but they came back night after night, until she was too afraid to look out the windows after the sun went down.  She’d close all the blinds, check the locks, and flinch every time a dog barked in the distance.  They never did anything.  They just… watched.

Finally, she sat Bryan down for a talk.  He couldn’t go into the woods for a little while, she said.  It was too dangerous.  He began to cry and his mother reassured him that this was only temporary, that she’d go to my parents and ask them for help and they’d take care of it.  That only made Bryan cry harder.

His mother told me that Bryan had always been quiet.  It was hard to get him to explain what was going on, but he did, in bits and pieces.

One day, while out in the woods, he saw a dog.  Pale cream with blue eyes.  It stood out in the open before him a moment and then turned and bounded away.  It was beautiful.  Tall and slender, ethereal like moonlight.  He’d never seen anything like it, so he followed.  The dog went on ahead of him, stopping every now and then and looking back with those pale eyes like a cloudless sky to make sure he was following.

Then his foot caught on something.  He glanced down and saw a trash bag laying at his feet.  When he looked up, the dog was gone, and no amount of searching could find it again.  He gave up and looked inside the bag.

It was full of dead puppies.

Bryan’s mother didn’t know what state the bodies were in and Bryan clearly didn’t want to talk about that, so she didn’t press.  Regardless of how they died, it was apparent human hands had done it, for the bag had been discarded in an area it wasn’t likely to be found.

Bryan cried over them for some time and then decided that he couldn’t leave them there.  They needed to be buried properly.  It was the least he could do for them.  So he struggled to lift the bag over one shoulder and then set off through the woods, staggering under the weight of all those tiny bodies.  He originally intended to bring them home, but they were heavy and he didn’t think he could make it that far.  But as he struggled along, his path veered to a place he hadn’t gone before.

An old abandoned church.  We have our fair share of abandoned buildings around here, leftovers from more affluent times, I suppose, and the church is one of them.  It’s not a large building.  Just a chapel, a back room, and an attic.  The roof collapsed long ago, heavy with the weight of moss, and the local children are warned to stay away from it.  Not because there’s anything dangerous inside - the police check on the buildings we know about periodically - but because the timber is rotted and there’s nails hiding in the weeds.

Bryan knew he wasn’t allowed, but he also knew the puppies needed a burial place.  And what was more appropriate than a churchyard?  He dug shallow graves for them with a stick, working until his hands were covered with mud and his fingernails broke.  He buried them all, marking each grave with a stone and scattering wildflowers over the mounds.

Then he went home and never told his mother what he’d done, for fear she’d be upset that he went onto the abandoned church grounds.

But the dogs didn’t stay there, Bryan said, and his mother said she felt her blood run cold at those words.  They’d followed him home.  He saw them in the woods when he looked out his bedroom window at night.

Could he let them in, Bryan asked.

So his mother, who was of Irish descent and knew quite a bit about the unnatural world herself, took a risk.  That evening, after sundown, she opened the front door and held it open.  Her heart pounded with fear.  Bryan waited upstairs in his bedroom with the door shut, as his mother had demanded.  One small concession for the danger she was about to potentially invite inside their house.  The dogs crept out of the woods, tails tucked low, heads held down.  They moved cautiously.  One tentatively stepped up on the threshold of their house and then crept inside.  It glanced up at her as it did with those glowing eyes.

The rest followed.  They were no longer puppies, but half-grown dogs.  Bryan was delighted.  And the dogs gained their confidence as soon as they saw him, yapping and licking his face in joyous exuberance.  They slept on his bed that night.

Their appearance grew more normal over the next few days.  Still unusual looking dogs, large like wolfhounds, but built like wolves.  Dark charcoal coats that seemed black in the right light.  Their eyes no longer glowed, but she saw glints of it deep inside sometimes, after sunset.

They say that the first soul buried at a churchyard stays there, guarding it from evil.  To spare a person from this fate, they bury a dog instead, and it becomes a church grim.  This was not a new church, but it was consecrated ground nonetheless.  And Bryan and his innocent grief summoned the souls of these slain dogs back to this earth, not to protect the church, but to protect the one who had cared enough to lay their bodies to rest.

I told you this story involves animal cruelty.  I wish it ends there, with the puppies, but it doesn’t.

I’ve said before that our town is not as innocent as they’d want you to believe.  The cozy small town exterior hides some dark secrets.  The proximity of the campground means that the locals here are far more aware of the unnatural side of this world.  They’ve learned how to avoid it.  How to survive it.  And some have learned how to exploit it.

We deal with them, in our own way.  My family are the ones that are asked to bloody their hands, but the town is eager to give their tacit permission.  Sometimes they’ll even help.  We do not harbor people who make bargains with evil things.

We do, however, look the other way for the lesser evils.

When I was a child there was a farm on the very outskirts of town that hosted fights on the weekends.  It started with dog fighting and was successful enough that they expanded.  People would come in from out of town to gamble on the fights.  They started bringing in more exotic animals.  And then, inevitably, they decided to try something unnatural.

The hard part would be finding a creature that they could control.  The campground gets a small share of creatures that pass through but poaching from our land risked retaliation.  Perhaps they’d get away with it once or twice, but eventually my family would figure out who it was.  And that’s how you get woken up in the night to find your house is on fire and all the doors and windows have been boarded up from the outside.

Finding a creature off our land is trickier.  The things we get don’t tend to stay long.  They roam the area, spiraling around the campground before entering it, they stay a little bit, and then they depart.  Tracking them is hard.  Capturing them would be even harder.

Even supposing they did manage to capture one of these creatures, they might not be able to use it in the fights.  There’s the risk of it injuring the bystanders.  People that get hurt or killed aren’t going to return the next weekend to place more bets.

They saw an opportunity with the grims.  Byran had them under control.  They’d do whatever he told them too.  Even better, they looked like ordinary dogs.  If they had a creature that was obviously a monster, then they couldn’t hold betting.  The outcome would be too obvious and no one would bet against it.  They could charge an entrance fee at the door, but that was all.  But with the dogs… pit a dog against a bear and everyone will bet on the bear, right?  The house knows better and shifts the odds so that they profit massively when the dog wins.

They could string it out for a while.  Start with dog against dog, then gradually move up to more dangerous animals.  Let people keep thinking that *this* time the dog would lose.  It wouldn’t last forever, of course, but it’d work long enough to make them a tidy fortune.

So one day, as Bryan was walking home from the bus stop, they pulled up alongside him and told him to get in the car.  They’d kill his mother if he didn’t, they said.  Wasn’t she home by herself?

Bryan complied.  He was scared and didn’t know what to do.  The car drove around aimlessly for a bit as they talked to Bryan and the dogs followed along behind.  They told him that they had connections to the police and would know if Bryan went to them.  And this was true - but it was only one officer and if nothing else, the old sheriff certainly wouldn’t tolerate internal corruption.  If Bryan were older, he might have understood this and known that there was nothing they could do to him.  The dogs can outrun cars.  There were enough of them that they could easily protect both him and his mother.  But Bryan was scared and confused and afraid for his mother, and he was a kind child, and didn’t want anyone to get hurt.

They told him that in a few days, on Saturday, he’d need to sneak out of the house and meet them with the dogs at the corner of his street.  They’d take him to a barn and he’d need to tell his dogs to fight some other dogs.  They made it sound like it wouldn’t be that big of a deal.  Just a fun little party.  He could hang out with the men and there’d be food and they’d even give him fifty dollars so he could buy something nice for his mother if he wanted.

Otherwise, they said, they’d shoot his mother.

Then they let him go, convinced they’d terrorized the child enough that he would comply.

That week, Bryan asked me what I would do if someone threatened my mother.  It was at lunch.  I waved my plastic butter knife in the air and loudly declared that I would kill them myself.  Everyone that was responsible.  Even as young as we were, I was still my mother’s daughter.

I only vaguely remember this.  But Bryan took it to heart and in those agonizing days before Saturday, he resolved to do something terrible, something he hated with all of his being.

That night, Bryan did exactly as he was told.  He snuck out of the house once his mother believed he was asleep.  The dogs slept outside now, in a shed, as that was cheaper than individual dog houses.  Bryan crawled through the doggy door and whispered to the dogs that they needed to follow him, but quietly.  All but one, that is.  That one was to stay behind and protect his mom.

The rest jumped the fence with him and hurried down the street to where the men were waiting with a pickup truck.  The dogs were subdued as the vehicle took them down dark country roads.  Bryan rode in the back with them and they crowded around him, licking his face and putting their heads in his lap.

They knew how this would end.

The men brought Bryan and the dogs in through the back of the barn.  It’d been divided in two and the other half shone with light.  It was still early, but people were already trickling in and the barn echoed with raucous laughter and shouting.  They offered to let him go look around, while the dogs stayed in the back, but Bryan shook his head, frightened by the unfamiliar surroundings.  One of the men stayed with him while the others left to prepare the crowd for the fight.  As Bryan’s eyes adjusted to the dim light, he saw that there were cages of frightened animals all around him.  Cats and dogs, a wolverine, and even a mountain lion, crammed into a corner in a cage too small for it to turn around in.

“Reckon your dogs can take it?” the man asked, noting where the boy was looking.

“I don’t know,” Bryan replied in a small voice.

“*I* bet it can.  But everyone else out there will bet on the mountain lion, especially if we only send out one or two of the dogs.”

“You said they’d be fighting other dogs.”

“Sure, sure, for tonight.  But mountain lions are expensive to feed and we don’t want to keep that thing around much longer.  Next weekend.  It’ll be fun to watch.”

And the man nudged Bryan with an elbow, as if they were buddies, as if he were introducing Bryan to the exciting world of adults.  Maybe in his mind he was.  But Bryan was miserable, agonizing over what he’d come here to do.

Just like I’d said.  Kill them all.

“Is the police officer here?” Bryan asked.  “He’s not going to bother my mom, right?”

The man naively interpreted this as a child’s worried question.  Nothing more.  What could a scared young boy be capable of?

Fear drives us to do desperate, terrible things.  It can be stronger than anger or hate.

“Oh sure, everyone is here,” the man replied reassuringly.  “We’re excited to see the fight.  Your dogs are going to be famous!”

It took a long time for Bryan to recount this story to his mother.  The details came out over the years.  But even when he could tell it without regret, he still did not remember how he replied to the man.  It was something that made him turn in surprise.  His eyes reminded Bryan of golf balls in the dim light, wide with shock as he stared down at the boy, seconds before one of the dogs hit him in midair.

The man went down with the dog standing over him, its jaws around his throat.  Bryan couldn’t see what happened, as the dog’s body blocked his view, but when the dog turned around its muzzle was sticky with blood.  Its eyes shone in the darkness.

“Go on, then,” Bryan whispered.

And the dogs flowed away from him, slamming into the thin plywood wall that divided the barn and breaking through to the other side.  Light poured in through the jagged holes and the laughter and talking of the spectators quickly turned to panicked screams.

The dogs didn’t make a sound.  They moved silently among the crowd, leaping from person to person and dragging them to the ground.  This was not the mindless savagery of a creature that revels in bloodshed.  The dogs were efficient.  There were gunshots, from some of the attendees that had the presence of mind to pull their guns, but those were quickly dispatched and soon the barn fell eerily silent.  Beyond the barn’s walls came the sound of engines, of cars spinning their tires from the haste of those that thought to flee.

The dogs can outrun cars.

Bryan remained in the barn, huddled against the wall with his hands over his ears.  It wasn’t until silence descended that he dared to move.  Trembling, he went from cage to cage and undid the doors.  The animals fled as soon as they were freed.  He even released the mountain lion.  I guess he’d seen too many Disney movies, because he opened the cage from the front, expecting that the freed mountain lion would tamely walk out, lick his face in thanks, and then bound majestically off into the woods.  Instead, he got a face-full of angry big cat.  Fortunately for him, the thing was panicked and just looking to escape, so it merely knocked him over and then ran over top of him and was gone out the open door before Bryan could even pick himself up.  He got scratched up a little, but it wasn’t the mauling it could have been.

It takes a while for police to respond to the outskirts of town.  Bryan had time to free all the animals by the time he heard sirens, and he quickly fled towards the woods at the edge of the fields.  The dogs rejoined him, one by one, and led him through the forest and along roads all the way home.  It took most of the night.

It was impossible for Bryan’s mother to miss that something strange had happened overnight.  Certainly, all the dogs were safe in their shed, but their fur was matted with dried blood.  Bryan was in his bed, but there was clothing in the hamper that was filthy with dirt that hadn’t been there the day prior.  And he had scratches on his chest and arms that were spaced far too wide to be from a stray cat.  She didn’t say anything at first.  Just cleaned up the dogs in the backyard, cleaned up his cuts and put bandaids on them, and acted like nothing was wrong.

Slowly, the rumors filtered around town.  A dog fighting ring was slaughtered overnight.  Except they weren’t fighting just dogs - all kinds of animals.  Probably had caught something they couldn’t handle.  There were strange things around here, after all, and rumor had it the police had asked the campground folks to look into it.

I think my parents knew.  I think they figured it out and talked to Bryan’s mother and then told the police it was exactly as it seemed - the people running it had caught something they couldn’t control and it had killed them all before escaping.  It wouldn't come back.  There was nothing for the town to fear.

In time, the town moved on.  The massacre became just another story told in hushed voices, late at night at the town’s only bar.  Another warning not to meddle with these inhuman creatures.

It wasn’t so easy for Bryan to move on.  He was horrified by what the dogs had done - what *he* had done.  For days he couldn’t even look at the dogs.  He flinched whenever they came near him.  He was living in abject fear, terrorized by these creatures with which he shared his house.  His mother finally realized the source of his nightmares and his outbursts and put the dogs outside in the yard for an extended time.

She sat him down.  They’re very special dogs, she told him.  They wanted to protect him and that was the only way they knew how.  Dogs are loyal, she said, and they wouldn’t hurt him.

Bryan replied, very softly, that he wasn’t mad at them.  They’d done what he told them to do.  *Exactly* what he’d told them.  And he was afraid he’d have them do it again someday.

He wasn’t scared of the dogs.  He was scared of what he’d done, through them.

How do you console a child that killed someone?  His mother told him that it was okay, that it had to be done.

It’s the same thing my parents told me, when I strangled my best friend to death.

Little wonder Bryan resents how we grew up.  We both came of age through bloodshed.

Byran’s mother told me all of this when she came to clean out his employee locker.  I got the master keys and took her there and she stood in front of it for a few minutes, staring at the interior.  There were no photos.  No momentos.  Just some clean clothing and a bag of tennis balls for the dogs.

“I feel like this is my fault,” she whispered.

It wasn’t, I quickly told her.  We all make our own choices.  Bryan made his.  And she broke down crying and told me everything that I just told you.

I wish I could end it here.  Just sign off like I usually do and life can continue on mostly as it had before.

But I can’t.  [I have more to tell](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lsn7y9/how_to_survive_camping_a_very_old_war/). [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

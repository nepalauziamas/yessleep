“the person you would take a bullet for is sometimes the one behind the gun.” That’s the thing my dad always use to say to me growing up. Of course as I was young I would never listen, looking back though I wish I had paid more attention to what he had said.

It was 3 years ago and I was walking home from school. It had been a pretty crappy day. My best-friend Niko wasn’t in as well as Leo my other friend. The worst part about it was the other people I had been hanging out with had slowly began to disappear one by one. It was odd, the day a friend was missing…so was Niko. I talked to my mum about it but she just blamed my dad for making me superstitious. I listened to her and shrugged it off as a coincidence. I mean come on my best friend doing something with my other friends, that just sounds stupid. I wish I had ignored my mum and listened to my gut maybe I could have changed the outcome of this tragedy. 

I tried calling Niko to see why he wasn’t in but he didn’t pick up so I tried Leo but it went straight to answer phone. Leo was always on his phone so that was the moment I knew something was off. I went to bed the night completely unaware of what my friend was doing. I tried to sleep but couldn’t, I just didn’t understand why no one was picking up the phone. Was it me? Did I do something wrong?

I woke up the next morning and something was telling me I shouldn’t go to school today but of course my mum was having none of it and told me to “stop being such a baby and go to school” I kissed her goodbye and went on my way. As I was walking past Niko’s street he leaped out from one of the bushes. “Hey Niko! You scared the life out of me!” He looked odd, as if he was possessed. He stood there looking me dead in the eyes and said “does this scare you more?” He was holding a pistol, digging it into my side. He told me to move and so I did, why wouldn’t I? After about 20 minutes of walking we arrived in a building that seemed to be under construction. He shoved me down onto a pile of rubble and told me to stay. My heart was pounding, this was it I was thinking this is where I die!

After what felt like hours Niko returned with his father. “Lovely catch Niko!” Niko looked at him and smiled. His father then walked off and Niko told me to do as I was told and only what I was told. He sat there stroking my face with the gun. “How does it feel to be so powerless? Scary? I don’t worry, all you have to do is one thing and then you can go home.” 

At that moment I had some hope, surely whatever I have to do I would be able to. A little while later niko’s father returned but he wasn’t alone. he was holding a women by the arm with a pistol to her head. “If you want to go home…your going to have to kill her.” I sat there shocked, there was no way I was going to kill anyone. “And if I don’t?” I asked. “Well if you decided to wimp out you’ll end up like them” Niko said as he pointed towards a bunch of bodies piled in a corner. They weren’t any people though, They were my missing friends, he had taken and killed them all.

I sat there for a moment trying to process everything, I knew one thing… I wasn’t going to kill anyone. “Go to hell!” I said. “Come on indigo, you kill people all the time on call of duty, it’s the same thing!” Niko said smiling. “This is nothing like call of duty Niko, this is real life.” He laughed waving his gun in the air. “Then I guess you have made your choice.” He pointed the gun straight at me and said “goodbye indigo” and then he shot me in the stomach. 

I must have been seen or heard because next thing I know I was in a hospital bed. The doctor told me that I was shot and the bullet went straight through my stomach and into my back. He said I will be fine apart from one thing… I was paralysed from the waist down. I sat there in shock, I didn’t understand how I was still alive.

That 2 months later they caught Niko and his dad and they were arrested, found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. I went to visit him for the first time and he asked me one question “did you have any last words? Anything you wanted to say to me that night?” I told him one thing and one thing only…

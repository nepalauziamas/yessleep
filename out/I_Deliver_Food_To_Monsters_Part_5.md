Uncle Marco was a Frankenstein. As I have explained before, Frankenstein is the preferred term for Mad Scientists or Grafters. Mad scientist is considered a slur among their community. See grafters are probably one of the few classifications of monsters that are more or less human despite their own meddling. Most Grafters had a fixation with adding to themselves. Often adding arms, organs and muscle to their bodies in a myriad of ways. This often resulted in them appearing quite monstrous. Give it another 20 years and such people might be considered visionaries, provided they get their rampant anti-social insanity under control. 

Uncle Marco was no exception. Deep in the woods he worked out of a home made of solid traditional brick work. It was built in secret and modeled to look like a small castle. It was also surrounded by a large electric fence with several security cameras and defensive measures. All of which was powered by, and I am quoting “Hamster creativity, which is infinitely greater than that of humans, because humans are too busy thinking about banking reform”, his words not mine. 

Our trip to his castle in the eastern forests of Minnesota was highly uneventful. I nursed my concussion while Vega drove. I wish I could say there was some really great back and forth between me and her, but that would be a lie. It was a solemn car ride that was given an even greater gravity by our mutual fear. Every car that passed us and every overhead noise had us looking around for The Night Watch frantically. Every state trooper speed trap, a harrowing reminder of the three dead assailants I had left in my house when we fled. Me and Other Sam constantly worried whether or not the bodies had been found yet. 

We parked the car in a ditch near a white piece of rebar Uncle Marco had put down as a sign to his customers and family. I removed my luggage and my tiny skeletal figurine from the rear view mirror. We talked as we walked through the forest.

“So what’s the deal with the skeleton in the dress?” Vega probed.

“It’s my family's patron saint. Santa Muerte, she was very important to our grandmother. She was like a witch or priestess or something in California. Our mom always said grandma could do amazing things thanks to her. Cure disease, curse the unjust, even reverse death on rare occasions. We never got to meet her.” I said.

“What happened to her?” Vega asked in a sympathetic tone. 

“Night watch got her.” Said Other Sam, anger boiling in our shared mind. “Or at least a version of them. Took her in the night and burned her at a stake while our mother and her father fled. They got her father too eventually. Somehow she escaped.” 

“That’s terrible!” She said, placing a hand on our shoulder.

“Yeah it’s not great. It was worse when they got our mother. We moved to Chicago when I was about 14 and she tried to hunt down her mother’s killers. She found herself on the wrong side of a gun when she found them. These are all she left us.” Said Other Sam in callous tone, lifting our shirt to display the two guns our mother left us. 

“She also left a letter, explaining how we were the best of our bloodline and how the guns symbolized us. They were made in the same factory, but we had been decorated differently. Other Sam was smart, perceptive, and sensitive.” I felt my left hand rub over the rose engravings on their gun. “I was more practical, callous, and task oriented. The only way we would ever survive is if we learned how to live together.”

There was a silence as the detritus of the forest floor squished and crunched beneath our footsteps. My left eye leaking as Other Sam let loose a bit of emotion internally. I hadn’t been able to cry since our mother died, but Other Sam never really got over it. A feeling recently reinvigorated. 

“What about you?” Asked Other Sam. “Where are your parents?” 

“Parent. Singular.” She said in a hollow voice. 

“How’s that work?” I asked?

“Unlike humans, my species doesn’t require men to reproduce. Or more specifically, in dire circumstances we can reproduce asexually.” She said somberly. “When we feel our lives are near an end we kind of just become pregnant. We give birth a month or two later to basically a clone baby. My mother stuck it out though, she raised me til I was about 11. Then those people you call The Night Watch came and killed her while we tried to escape.”

There was a moment of heavy silence. The bitter sweet connection of shared trauma lingering in the air as we all processed our linked backgrounds. She broke the silence by removing the red velvet box from her hoodie pocket.

“This is what she left me. These marbles, she loved them so much. She was fascinated when the first marbles were invented, and had these custom made. I have to admit I am quite fond of them too. I just don’t know if they mean anything.”

“Not everything has to mean something. Sometimes things are just nice and meaningless. Better to be that than awful and meaningful,” Said Other Sam, in a moment of philosophical skull duggery. 

“I just don’t get why they wanted to kill me and my mother.” Said Vega, looking down at her bare feet as she walked. “She was a seamstress, we ate shellfish and never hurt anyone. Why do they want us dead? If it wasn’t for the eyes and antenna and the sticking to walls we’re basically just normal people.”

“What about the extra forearms?” I asked. 

She rolled up a baggy sleeve exposing the second mantid-like appendage, connected to her elbow, and  tucked against the back of her upper arm. 

“Good thing baggy clothes never really go out of fashion.” She said with a slight smile. “As long as no one sees these or watches me eat, I am just like anyone else. I even had a job!” 

“I guess they just don’t care. If it’s not human, it doesn’t belong.” I said, pondering the question.

“So you don’t eat heads?” Said Other Sam.

“Why would I eat heads?” Stammered Vega. 

“Well you’re “The Mantis Lady”, praying mantises eat heads” Other Sam retorted, with an incredulous tone.

“Firstly, that is harmful mantis stereotype, it’s the current fucking year Sam. Secondly, that only happens when Praying Mantises are hungry during the reproductive process. Read a book Sam.” 

“Yeah read a book Sam!” Said Other Sam, attempting to pass the buck onto me.

“Nice try Other Sam, I know the difference between you two.” 

I felt blood rushing to my face, a sign of Other Sam’s embarrassment. We stopped a few feet away from the large electrified fence gate. A sign hung on it stating ‘condemned by the forest service, also no soliciting I have all the vacuum cleaners I could ever need you fucking leeches’. Two cameras posted atop the gate turned to view me and Vega. I waved to the camera with a smile. A small speaker shot out of the ground and the sound of a haggard, gravely voice clearing its throat cracked through the speaker. 

“Sam, how have you been!” Said the voice in a delighted yet manic tone. “I haven’t seen you two since you were 18 and rejected my offer to join my lab. Sauntered off to join the military and didn’t even have the decency to bring me back some organs! Who’s that with you?”

That was Uncle Marco for you. Prone to speaking in paragraphs that resembled a stream of consciousness more than coherent thought.

“This is Vega, we’re on the run from The Night Watch and maybe the police. We’d like to use that backdoor to Mexico you built for family vacations.”

“Haven’t seen you in nearly a decade and you come all this way to ask to use the family portal. No calls on my birthday, no visits since you were a little shit and you come here asking me for favor. Ha! Isn’t that just like family these days, no traditional values, no respect, come on in and have a cup of coffee.” 

The gate of the large fence began to slide open as the loud hum of electricity temporarily dissipated. We walked through the open gate and up a cobblestone path. The castle had always seemed bigger when I was a kid, but now that I was older it looked more like a modern three story home. Still quite large, but definitely less magical than I remember. The large wooden doors opened as Uncle Marco’s hulking frame emerged from the well illuminated “lab”. Uncle Marco was something else, unlike other grafters he didn’t know when to stop. He stood at about 7 feet tall with oversized muscles rippling over his body. Atop his monstrously grafted trapezius muscles were a set of long slender arms that terminated in tiny dainty plastic hands. A third set of arms rested near the front of his body tucked close to his stomach. Extra eyes implanted along his forehead darted back and forth scanning the horizon. His barely covered body was a patchwork of stapled and scarred flesh he had added to make room for his various surplus organs. He held a small plastic bin in his hands and laid it on the ground along with a towel.

“Please clean off your feet young lady.” He said to Vega. “Can’t have you tracking any muck into the lab, it really irritates the tesla coils if they see too much dirt. Honestly I don’t know why they are moody, I didn’t even give them sentience. I guess thought finds its way into anything given enough time.”

“So how’s everything going Uncle Marco?” Asked Other Sam, as I watched Vega gingerly remove the forest filth from her feet.

“Oh you know a little of this, a little of that. More or less things have been fine. Been having trouble trying to figure out a better way to turn jelly donuts into a renewable energy source, but sadly the donuts are not cooperating.”

“Why not try cheese Danish?” I offered.

“What am I, a filthy plutocrat?” He replied indignantly “No, no, no we can’t be having cheese Danishes solve the gas crisis! What will the lactose intolerant think of me if I made such an invention!”

Vega dumped the muddied water from the plastic bin and folded the moist towel before offering it to Uncle Marco.

“Thank you, Sir,” She said solemnly, bowing her head. 

“Please call me Marco, Sir is my uncle, but he prefers the name Sergio. No one calls me sir except for the little Sams. Though I must say you have excellent manners and hygiene. Please come in, have some coffee and a donut or two. If you do have a donut though, make sure the other donuts see you eat it. I wanna teach them a lesson, but I can’t bring myself to do it. Donuts are sensitive pastries.”

We followed Uncle Marco into his lab and…how do I describe this. When you think of the term Mad Scientist, whatever you think their lab looks like is probably about right. Four large tesla coils were in each corner of the high ceilinged room. Each one had a base covered in hamster balls, each hamster ball was full of a green fluid and a series of tubes that led from the back of the hamster balls to small floating hamsters. They seemed to be sleeping, occasionally one of the horde of hamsters would twitch a little. It was like the matrix, but for hamsters. The walls were lined with different tubes or apparatuses of indescribable purpose. An old Buick sat somewhat out of place near a tower of donut boxes. Several donuts had been taped to various surfaces on the vehicle. Next to the vehicle and donut boxes was a small table with three chairs and four cups of coffee. 

He beckoned us to sit at the table. We obliged even though Other Sam was trying to pull me over to one of the tesla coils for some reason. Other Sam always liked electricity and hamsters, so this was a dream come true for them. I took one cup of coffee and added some milk and an ungodly amount of sugar for Other Sam. I placed that cup in my left hand before putting the other cup in my right hand. I added nothing to my coffee, I always drank it black just like Uncle Marco. 

“Thank you so much for your hospitality.” Said Vega, adding a few sugar cubes to her coffee. 

“Not a problem young lady. Might I ask what you are?” He asked, with flagrant disregard for tact. “You see this eye works kinda like an x-ray and you have very interesting biology. Never seen anything quite like it actually.” 

“They call me ‘The Mantis Lady’, as far as what I actually am I couldn’t tell you.” She said, drinking slowly from her cup. 

“Fair enough, I often wonder what I am. I don’t feel like I fit in with other Grafters and Frankensteins, no no no, my ideas are often considered too radical. Apparently I go overboard with my personal modifications.” He said, fanning all six of his arms out in a flourish. “So Sams, why are you on The Night Watch’s radar?”

“Well I took a contractor job delivering food to monsters, and I’ve apparently found myself in their crosshairs. Probably doesn’t help that I killed two of their personnel yesterday. Also the cops are probably gonna find those bodies, which is why I need to get the fuck out of dodge.”

“Also Sam wants to elope with Vega here?” Said Other Sam, drinking deep from their overly saccharine coffee sludge. 

“Well what about you Other Sam? I still have that clone body I made for you when you were younger, we could try cramming you in there if you don’t want to go.” Said Marco, pressing a button somewhere under the table. “Oops wrong button, I should really put some eyes on my hands to keep that from happening.” 

A large cloth was pulled off of a cage in the corner with a loud swish. Inside were a bunch of small gray puppies suckling from a larger gray dog. The sound of a chair grinding against cobblestones emanated as Vega rose quickly from her seat.

“Oh my god!” She exclaimed before pointing at the graphic on her hoodie. “I am gonna pet them!” 

She ran over to the cage and opened the door before crawling in and attempting to cuddle with all the Weimaraner puppies. I smiled, after everything we had been through the last day and a half, she deserved a moment of indulgent happiness. Other Sam was less amused and cautiously watching to see if the mother of the litter would attack. 

“I like your friend. She’s interesting.” His tone grew dull and menacing. “Any chance the Night Watch soldiers you killed were your mother’s killer?”

“I couldn’t say, I don’t know who killed our mom. I am sorry we couldn’t protect her.”

“You were young, there was nothing you could do. She knew what she was getting into, I just miss her. My sister was the bravest of all of us and she died doing what she loved, pursuing justice. She died a good death, surely Santa Muerte allows her to rest with our ancestors” 

He said this in a sad tone with a sort of mental focus I rarely ever saw on Marco. He perked up though as Vega’s feet pounded the stone floor running towards us with a puppy in hand. 

“I know I just met you, and this is crazy, but I want this puppy, it’s now my baby!” She said, in a breathlessly excited sing song voice. 

“Sure, you can have that one, I can always get more puppies. Just make sure you feed it and it doesn’t pee on my floor.” Said Marco, smiling. 

“Your name is Emperor Floop, and I am going to post pictures of you on reddit everyday!” She said in an excited tone.

It was a perfect moment. It was a ray of light breaking through the stormy clouds of the past couple of days. Even Other Sam was happy. Then a siren rang out and a series of large monitors descended from the ceiling, chilling my spine and spiking my adrenaline. Emperor floop whimpered quietly in Vega’s arms as Marco rose and ran to the monitors. I heard a cacophony of voices calling my name.

“Sams, would you please come take a look at this.” Beckoned Uncle Marco.

I looked in horror at the monitors. Slowly seeping through the bars of the electric fence was an all too familiar fleshy mass. Along its oozing mass were several eyes and gibbering mouths that cried out for me. It was Cole, and he was the color of a crimson sunset. He was pissed.

“Another friend of yours?” Asked Uncle Marco.

“Former client who is obsessed with consuming me to separate me and Other Sam. Apparently our ‘meat cries for liberation’, his words not ours.” I said, a cold sweat breaking out along my body. 

Other Sam reached our left hand down drawing their pistol, I did the same for my pistol. If it wasn’t one thing it was another, and I wasn’t gonna let anyone else get hurt because of me. Me and Other Sam were both thinking the same thing. That one beautiful moment with family and seeing Vega happy was worth preserving. This was worth dying for, this was the good death I prayed for. 

“What are you doing!?” Shouted Vega as I started walking towards the door.

“I am gonna get him to leave. Chances are I am not coming back. Uncle Marco please make sure she makes it out of here.” I said, trying to swallow the fear in my shaky voice. 

“You can’t kill that thing you idiots. That’s a fucking flesh beast, the thing has enough organs to live until the sun burns out. Honestly I am a bit jealous of it.” Said Marco matter of factly.

“And you two can’t leave me like this after bringing me this far!” Said Vega with tears in her eyes. 

I turned to them both, and for the first time since our mother died. Me and Other Sam both cried. I was crying, because I was afraid. I couldn’t tell you what I was afraid of though. Was afraid of what Cole would do to me? Was I afraid of leaving behind the people who cared about me? Was I afraid of them getting hurt trying to help me? I know in that flurry of emotions me and Other Sam shared there was something there. It was a new type of terror one we had never experienced. It was a fear built from loss, mourning, uncertainty, and responsibility. We were two small people inhabiting one mortal body, a body that would hopefully last long enough to save Vega and Uncle Marco. It was like the feeling you get when you peer over the edge of a cliff or building and imagine the sheer terror of the fall. 

Uncle Marco beckoned me over as he cracked two sets of knuckles. He removed a smart phone from his pocket and began pressing buttons. I saw on the monitors as three hamster powered tesla coils erupted from his hard and started arcing electricity over the fleshy amorphous form of Cole. 

“See, you two don’t have to do everything by yourselves. Let us see how that beast handles the might of electricity!” He said, letting out an almost stereotypical maniacal laugh.

The smell of burning putrid flesh washed into the room as Cole continued to scream out Other Sam and I’s name. The mass was growing from a sunset crimson to a shade of red that seemed to break the visual spectrum and push into the purest incarnation of red itself. Two large arms emerged from the burning mass and grasped at two of the coils. They were torn free of the ground and slammed into dirt so hard the metal shattered sending a multiplicity of hamster balls flying through the air. Then my heart sank as Cole’s makeshift arms slammed the remains of the two coils into the third. His gelatinous form undulated as large chunks of charred flesh sloughed off him. His body reconvened into a monstrous column of moving meat and slithered its way forward again. I stared wide eyed at the monitors, pulse pounding in my ears and all the moisture left my mouth. I felt all the muscles in my body tense before I felt a large hand slap my back hard.

“That’s not all I got. Calm down Sams, I’ve planned for an incursion.” Marco said, pressing more buttons on his phone.

There was a sound of metallic groaning from up above. Then a screech unlike anything I've ever heard. The very noise shook the stones of the makeshift castle and I saw a large shadow appear over Cole’s undulating form, then in an instant two large bird-like talons drove into the ground with enough force to shake the earth and crack the cobblestones outside. Whatever the creature was it began trying to lift Cole, but as it pulled the ground beneath Cole began to bulge. Further and further the fleshy mass of Cole was dragged skywards, but soon any hope I had been feeling was washed away as the ground roiled and large tendrils of meat erupted from the ground. All of them reached skyward and there was a tremendous thud as they seemed to pull down that giant creature attacking it. It momentarily looked like a giant turkey vulture, before it was rapidly consumed. 

“Oh, I guess there is a lot more of him, but he’s hiding a lot of his mass underground. Very clever, he must have some very smart brains in that mass of his.” Said Marco, scratching his chin with one of his six hands. 

I began to hyperventilate, I couldn’t think of a single thing that could stop Cole. Marco seemed to be in some sort of envious awe of Cole, and Vega was cowering under the small table with Emperor Floop. There was no other way out. I had to face the music. I turned towards the door and flinched as I heard a meaty thud against the large wooden frame. 

“I am sorry you got dragged into this Uncle Marco. Once he has me he should leave.” I said, a lump growing in my throat.

“Told you Cole was going to kill us.” Added Other Sam. 

I attempted to take a shaky step forward before I felt two large hands grab me. I was lifted up as one might lift a child and felt as Uncle Marco began sprinting towards a large metal door at the back of his lab. 

“Come with us Vega! There is not much time.” Shouted Marco. 

I looked and saw her spring from under the table as the stone floor began to roil upwards. Multiple gibbering meaty tendrils shot into the air striking randomly at the room. Then a large deformed facsimile of a face emerged from a growing hole in the lab's floor. 

“You will be harvested Sam! I will free you from your prison!” Boomed a cacophony of anguished voices.

I heard the grating of a metal door, and was thrown inside a blank metal room. Vega bounded through the doorway as well and then Uncle Marco stood in the doorway. He was breathing heavily as his eyes darted around. 

“That shiny hole in the floor doesn’t go to Mexico. We don’t have time to power up the portal, but that pool will take you to your great Uncle Sergio’s lab. You’ll be safe there. Tell the old bastard I still hate him.” Shouted Marco.

“What about you!?” Me and Other Sam screamed with tears in our eyes.

“What about me? That freak tearing up my lab has all the muscles and organs I could ever want. Let him try and eat my mind. I’ll drive him madder than a hatter on LSD!” He shouted, laughing maniacally as he closed the door. 

I heard the locking mechanism slide into place, and the room grew deathly silent. I ran to the door and tried to find a way to open it. Other Sam screamed out in pain as I slammed our fists against the heavy metal doors. I pressed my ear against the door trying to hear anything out there. There was no way for me to see or perceive what was happening out there. I sunk to the floor, and tucked my head into my knees. 

“I can’t believe we let another person we cared about die.” I said.

“We don’t know he’s dead, it’s Uncle Marco. Maybe he had like a plan for this.” Offered Other Sam tearfully.

“No, he was just sparing us the pain of watching him die. We have failed to save anyone. We failed everyone.” 

“Not me.” Said Vega, meekly. “You saved me and Emperor Floop. You helped me to keep living.”

She offered a hand and raised us to our feet. Now let's take one last journey together, let’s not let Marco’s sacrifice be in vain. She walked me over to a shimmering silver pool in the ground. I stared at its rippling surface and perceived several odd geometric and organic shapes forming in its constantly fluctuating surface.

“Are you sure you wanna jump into that?” I said, sadness and paranoia still racking my mind with existential dread.

“As long as you’re with me I am.” 

We held hands and jumped in. We emerged in a freezing cold room lined with iced over tubes. I cautiously walked over to one of them and wiped away some frost with my hand. I recoiled in shock as I saw what looked like a mangled human body with thin tendrils of silver erupting through the skin. I fell backwards in a fright as a large door opened nearby and a handsome silver haired man dressed in a fine Italian suit walked into the room. He greeted us with a friendly and charismatic voice. 

“It’s nice to see you Sam. I haven’t seen you since you were born. I am your Great Uncle Sergio, and this is my company Vitae Life Solutions LLC.” He said this with a warm smile. “You two and your friend will be safe here.”

—

It’s been a couple days since all of that transpired. Apparently I have a Great Uncle, he has us and Vega working for him now. Me and Other Sam are working in asset recovery. Vega is working in IT with some nervous guy named Alan. He’s a nice guy, but he’s a sarcastic son of a bitch that Other Sam likes to get into arguments with. I really can’t tell you too much about this place, as it would be bad operational security, but I can tell you we are safe and happy here. We’re not sure what happened to Uncle Marco or Cole, but Sergio says he’s gonna allocate some resources to finding out. 

I still have nightmares about the people I’ve left behind. I still feel terrible about a lot of what happened. Other Sam seems to have finally warmed up to Vega though they still make offensive comments about her mantis-like qualities. We get along better now though, and we work together pretty well. Thank you all for being with us through this journey. I don’t think we could have made it here without you all.

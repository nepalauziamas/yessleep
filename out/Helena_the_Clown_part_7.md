With the horrible things I have said in the next post, I wonder how many of you are still here, to read. I hope I shall never have to put into words such things, until I finish all my ”adventure”. But who knows what is out there...  Somewhat still shaken by those things, I went to my friend Adrian, the antiquities dealer. That is his secondary job, his main job is in call center, owned by some French company. He lives alone on an apartment on Romana Square, pretty close to the center of Bucharest. We have met at our University studies. We followed different paths after wards, but kept in touch. I knew no one I could go at the moment. I had saved in my phone some information from the newspapers from the 1920ties, to talk to him. I arrived sometimes late in the evening.

&#x200B;

I have found him on a very chill mood, like he was most of the time. I sunk myself in his sofa and opened my phone. He came with the cups of Thai tea. ”Are you ok, Rux? You look... I don„t know how to put it...” he started. ”No, I guess I am not.” I replied. ”You know, about a week ago all this would have sounded like some horror movie, or some creepypasta online. After a few hours of immersion, I would be back. Am I loosing my mind?” Adrian had a quirky look. I am pretty sure he would have replied: ”Yes.”, but he bite his tongue and he said: ”Let go. It makes no sense. You shall hurt yourself for nothing.” I looked him in the eye: ”You know, if am right, and I am probably, right, you made something really dumb. You sold that diary to someone who might be able to use the details of the sorcery in there to actually attempt some things. I am thinking not just of what I read, but of what could have been in the pages you have not scanned.” To tone down the harsh words, I put up a stupid smile, a tired smile.

&#x200B;

He chuckled: ”It is in your mind, you want it to be true. Relax, it can not be true. Laie the Butcher was a madman, who knows what drugs he took... I do not know what substances were available back then around here. Opioids were used, like morphine. But coke or something stimulant was more likely involved. He was very creative in all.” After a moment of silence, he continued: ”No, that could not be real. Everything has a reasonable explanation. Take each part at a time: The attack on that guy could have been performed by some madman in drag. Who else could go walking around at night, dressed in belle epoque dress on the streets of Colentina, at night? The old lady eased her loneliness telling you some urban legends from her youth, perhaps embellishing them. Yeah, there a clear urban legend about all that. You know how people are...”

&#x200B;

I started to laugh muffledly. I stopped after a few seconds, then I said: ”You know, the period when she was at the circus.... Before the Obor fair times. I have found an article on a waltz Helena and Jameson performed one evening. People were mind blown, many did not knew that Helena was suppose to a puppet, an inanimate object. The others who knew what she was suppose to be were, many of them, scared. They said it was no way one could make a ventriloquist doll to move like that. Unless it was something supernatural. My guess is that, since then, the management of circus became scared of all this and they were eager to get rid of all. They pushed some limits, there were too many people who so all those with their own eyes.”

&#x200B;

”Have you thought that, at least in some episodes, there was an actual person pretending to be Helena? A living dancer? The simplest explanation of all. ”

&#x200B;

Awkward silence. It could, theoretically, have sense. He continued: ”All the massacres could have been committed by multiple people, dressed like the doll from the circus. There have been other similar phenomenons in other parts of the world, like the Spring-Heeled Jack in London, that was proven to be the work of multiple individuals on a costume, during some forty years.”

&#x200B;

Yeah, the Spring-Heeled Jack, probably there was something real there. A very complex phenomenon, perhaps Jameson was connected somehow? ”And”, he continued, ”What do you think you so that night? That woman? Perhaps that was a prankster. Perhaps there are a team of pranksters, some work on the street lights, one of them wears a dress...”

&#x200B;

That was funny. It really made me laugh a bit. He looked abashed. ”You know,” I said. ”All things, taken into account, could be like you said. But there is one thing, one very important things. If we look at the big picture, how things fit, it becomes harder and harder to see things like that.” He wanted to say something, but he could not find his words. Finally, he replied: ”I  think you should take  a day off from work and spend the night here. Some chance may do wonders.” ”I have a better idea. I have my car. The night is young. I shall contact Helena.” ”You are insane. We do not know what kind of people are those behind this and what could be the consequences.” ”Neah”, I replied in a good mood. ”Nothing ordinary seems to be here. If it is to harmed, at least it would be by something interesting. And, honestly, I am put an end to my obsession, if I can. If this has a natural explanation, I want to see it now. And get on with life after it.”

&#x200B;

He looked abashed again. ”Ok. We take your car, mine has some issues. I shall stay next to you, and call the police, if neccessary.” ”Its a deal.” So, we went to Colentina and parked the car near the place I had parked the last time.  We waited. To pass time, we talked about our past, our lives, politics etc Almost nothing about the ”Helena phenomenon”. Adrian felt sleepy, so, at some point, I let him go to sleep and kept scrolling on the phone.

&#x200B;

Then, after a while, the phone started to flash. I could not make the flash go, and it went dead at once. I knew I had enough battery. Then, the lights on the street went out. This was it. I decided not to put Adrian at risk, so I left the car and the door open, in order not to wake him up. I was standing on sidewalk and waited. In a few minutes, I so the woman in black coming to us, just like the last time. Dread came over me. Any doubt Adrian has placed in mind was gone at that point, when the dread came. I felt like going back to the car, wake Adrian up and drive as fast as possible away from there. A strong voice in head screamed to get away, that I am in mortal danger. And the voice was probably right. But I took a deep breath and went to Helena.

&#x200B;

She so me and, at one meter distance, we stopped and looked at each other. Yes, this was not living human being. I do not know how to start describing her. She looked like a corpse walking, with a slit face above the chin, just like a ventriloquist doll. That clown makeup or makeup-like tattoo was part of the face, it seemed. She looked at me with those eyes... How shall I say... My heart went beating up, I fought my brain not to went to panic mode.

&#x200B;

”Hello, Helena. My name is Ruxandra.” Akward silence. If it weren„t for the terror in me and in the air around, I guess it would have been embarrassing. If she was human, of course. I forced myself to speak: ”I know about you. I know some things about you. About your past and...” I did not knew what to say. Sometimes, she looked just dead, sometimes she looked like a nightmare hooking my soul. But, probably, she was startled and did not knew what to say. So, she broke the silence. Her un-human, cold voice was hissing gently, like a snake, but words were clear: ”What do you want? Don„t you know that, if you are not right, I shall end you?” I stood my ground. She continued with a calm and cruel tone: ”Are you naughty? Are you a good person? Is there anything bad you do, you shall tell me. Now.” She was piercing through my soul. I knew that, if I lie, she will know. What was I thinking, giving myself to the claws of death? I brought it on myself. But, if I panic and ran, it is game over. This predator shall chase me and take me down. So, breath in and replied trembling: ”I do not know. Probably not.” ”How come?” She continued sharply: ”I am a TV journalist. And, as a TV journalist I am paid to lie. To deceive people. And I do it on a daily basis. There are people who pay me to keep people away from the truth. I am guilty of that.” She was moving slowly towards me, pushing me gently into a fence. ”People get hurt because of you, right?” ”Yes, they do. I guess. They are kept not to revolt, not to be free. I serve the wicked.” At this point, I was shaking pretty deep. I do not think I was crying yet.

&#x200B;

”And are you willing to change?” she continued, taking out one of the bayonets in her right, gloved hand. I was against the fence, at this point. She moved the knife under my tongue, slowly, ruthlessly. ”I do not know. I wish I was. Honestly, if you let me go, I would probably continue doing what I do. You can kill me, if you want. This is what you do. But, there is something I can promise you. I can try to change. I do not know if I shall succeed. But I shall try. I promise.” I was crying at this point. She took the bayonet and started to cut, gently, my skin. She continued to make cuts down to the chest, slowly and calmly. Blood was coming out, I felt it. But I did not care. I waited for the final blow.

&#x200B;

The, she let the knife down and came close to my face. She opened her mouth and, from behind those black lips, her sharp fangs became visible. She touched my neck with them, just touching, then pinching. I knew there are predators who play with their prey before taking it down. When I felt the fangs piercing the skin, I knew it was over. I closed my eyes and waited for death to come.

&#x200B;

But death came not. She moved away. The bite was only skin deep. She looked deeply into my eyes with some weird curiosity. Her expression has changed. I do not know how to put it. I was crying like a baby then: ”I promise I shall try.” I swallowed my tears. She put the knife back at her belt. Then she came closely to my ear, I started to shiver even more now. She whispered: ”Then go for it.” She backed away a bit.

&#x200B;

”Thank you.” I replied. I turned my back and moved away slowly towards the car. She came behind me, from a distance. Calmly, I have entered the car. Adrian was still sleeping. Helena moved on to her business.

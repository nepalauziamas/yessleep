Hello all, this is my first reddit post. I’m going to keep this as simple as possible and explain it as best I can. I’m an indigenous Australian man, 21 years old to be exact. I inherit my culture from my mother who is also indigenous, if you are indigenous or know of anyone indigenous you will know that they/we are very spiritual people. This is not the case for me, I have grown up my whole life listening to my mother rant on about her ghost experiences and I’ve never really believed her as bad as that sounds. It just doesn’t seem right that there is someone or something in your presence trying to scare you or connect with you.

Anyway, now onto the story. I just moved into my new place 2 weeks ago with my best mate that I’ve known for about 6 years. This house is about 15 years old and it’s 3 stories tall, it’s a 2 bedroom house and the bedrooms are on the top floor. The first thing that started having me concerned were hearing footsteps on the stairs outside my room. These footsteps didn’t sound like shoes walking up the stairs it just sounded like creaking. Now keep in mind at this time I do not believe their is such things as ghosts and I would eliminate any possible scenario first before even thinking about there being a paranormal spirit/demon in my house.

So yes I was concerned but I initially thought the house is fairly old so their could just be that the house is old and creaking. Some other things started happening such as lights being on when I came home and stuff like that. I was still concerned but nothing really that has made me overthink to much. 

My girlfriend stays over most nights during the week and this is when I started getting concerned as we were sleeping in bed and we could here thumps down stairs occasionally. A few nights go by and my girlfriend is over once again, we got a movie playing in my room and it’s about 9pm, suddenly my aircon turns on, i check to see it the aircon remote is on the bed and I’ve accidentally sat on it. This was not the case as it was on the wall In it’s holder. This part wasn’t exactly scary for me it was just weird. 

3 nights later me and my girlfriend turn off the TV and go to bed at 10:30pm on the dot as I remember setting my alarm for work the next day. This is where it got really scary for me and my girlfriend. I have woken up to someone/something laughing at the end of my bed. I slightly get up in a fight but not to fast cause I assumed my girlfriend was still asleep. The laugh sounded like a little girl and it was in my room, so close it sounded like it was legit 2 meters away from me. However I was in a delusional state and I thought I woke up from a scary dream and that it was just from my dream. I roll over immediately to see my girlfriend roll over the same time. We have woken up at the same time. I didn’t want to ask if she heard something because I wanted to hear her say it first so I knew I wasn’t crazy. Sure enough she said to me “Did you hear that”. I knew what I heard but I wanted her to say it first so I replied with “hear what” and she said “that laugh” and my heart sank, I was in shock and couldn’t believe it. We woke up turned the lights on and stayed awake the rest of the night. I’m writing this the next day as I’m sleeping at my parents house tonight waiting for them to come over tomorrow to see if anything happens when they’re around.

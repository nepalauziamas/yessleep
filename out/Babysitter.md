Tw: Death, suicide, sh


As you read this I'm currently dead or worse. It all started when my friend told me to sign up for this app. "the Babysitting app", but know as I think about it she was nervous and sweaty when she showed me it. When I did sign up it was weird, it was asking personal questions, I shrugged it off as I thought it was just getting the information for the perfect child. I was wrong, a few days ago I was assigned into watch these two children. Their parent had weird hours so they needed a babysitter, I wouldnt normally do it because I'm sleeping during that time but I was getting payed a lot for it.


Day 1. The boy was odd he was in his room but he..Or it, was a teen so I deemed it as normal teen behavior but he never came out..Even to eat, the daughter which was around 12 or 9, I didn't know what it was but something was off about her. It was mid-day and I was making lunch for them, and I hear clashing. I walked to the boys room as asked if everything was okay, he didn't respond so had to walk in. The boy was no where the window was open was I check out the window, nothing. I shouldnt had walked into the room...When lunch was ready it was just the girl since it was the first day I thought nothing of it, and I had assumed he didn't want to eat. 


Day 2. Something change about the house, I knew it. The boy and the girl were different something changed, maybe their faces they greatet me, but there was something I realized I had never met face to face to with their parents they just called me. Which was odd it many ways, I did my normal thing I watched a show with the girl the boy was in his room doing who know what. I told the girl I was going to check up on the boy she look and me and was angry but she looked back,they reaction was not normal. As I walked up the stairs it felt like they just stretched up forever, but I made it up. I walked to his room I knocked on the door...no answer, I knocked again...No answer, I opened the door he (THERE IS SUICIDE HERE) He was there hanging I screamed the girl running up the stairs smiling, I didn't notice it until now I got my phone she took it from me and said "Don't worry it'll disappearand there will be a new one" at this point I was shaking, was I wrong? Should I quit, I couldn't not until I figure out what's wrong....


Last day. Today was the day I decided I would quit I walked up to the door and both of them are there, the son and daughter, like one of them was a doll. I greated them and walked up with the son, the daughter was visbably angry, upset, she was red. I asked the son what was going on, he looked at me and said "Get out of here, you don't want to end up like me" (SH HERE!!!) he started bleeding he looked at his wrists and looked at me he passed out I was horrid maybe this time he wouldn't make it back..I walked downstairs and I was the girl,. She was angry I didn't say anything 

present time


I'm hiding in a closet which lead to the basement I don't want to go, it may be how I survive but I know that no one goes into the basement, I don't know how it happened the girl was sitting on the sofa and was looking down. She..no it turned into something I can't describe and it's searching for me I don't know and I'm scared, why would my friend do this to me? I need to leave. I'm going to try and run to the door if I don't make it these will be the last things I say..write, mom I'm sorry for being such a disappointment,
Dad I'll miss you, brother your silly. but I love you.

Guys, I need some advice and I need it quick. Here’s what happened.

&#x200B;

There was nothing special about today. I had days like this before - it’s all the same. I just did the usual: drove my ass to the gas station, stick out with Cory a bit, grab a beer, do my thing, go home, get down to business, get to sleep. 

&#x200B;

My routine is almost automated by now, I start to lose the thirst for life. It’s always the same: same words, same actions, same consequences. My life is boring, but I guess it would be even worse without letting the steam out. 

&#x200B;

I don’t have many friends, and if it wasn’t Cory who helps me from time to time - you could call me a loner. That has always been like that since Ma & Pa passed away. So I take care of the house, mow my lawn, toss some carrots and apples around for deer to it - that’s my life. If it wasn’t for my thing - I’d go insane, I tell you.

&#x200B;

Tonight felt as bland as the three times I went out before. Nothing new, same old. But I was out already, so…

&#x200B;

There was that chick at the gas station, very pretty. I ate a mint and walked to say hi. She was friendly and nice. I liked her. Then we went to my place, as usual. I did the same things as I did with my other guests. To make the impression, you know… Candles, nice music, the right amount of temperature.

&#x200B;

“Make yourself at home, hon” - I said to her, walking to pour myself some whiskey. She refused to have some. No wonder, that’s a man’s drink. 

&#x200B;

But when I came back - she wasn’t there. She left. I dropped the glass and it shattered off the concrete floor. That was my favorite glass, you know. 

&#x200B;

I was overwhelmed with frustration, as the night was ruined. I didn’t expect much, but this was not expected. Nobody left this house without me walking the out through the backdoor.

&#x200B;

But soon I noticed some more details and my frustration quickly washed away with fear. For the first time in my life, I feared for my life. My machete was gone. I left it right there - on the table across the room. For putting some respect to her, you know. And to tingle her nerves. The ax was gone too. I called it “Finisher” for obvious reasons. She took it from me. 

&#x200B;

I have no idea how she untangled herself - nobody did this before. I did the same knots as usual. 

&#x200B;

What do I do? There’s an armed person who wants to harm me in my own house. I can’t get to the police, because, you know… They will look around, find my mementos and if they do - I’m getting a night-night injection. I can’t leave, 'cause if I do - she will bring cops here herself and we’re back to the first scenario. 

&#x200B;

So I’m asking for your advice, guys. I can hear the floorboards creaking above, she’s still in the house somewhere. She’s not running away for her life. This time is different. I locked myself in the basement, as I am typing this. But she’s smart. Help.

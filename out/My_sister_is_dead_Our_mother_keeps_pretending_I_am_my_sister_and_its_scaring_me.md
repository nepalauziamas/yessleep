I'm really just... scared and concerned. I'm worried for my mom, and I genuinely know this is a mental thing and that she just needs therapy, but still. I can't help but be scared of her.

So, my twin sister, Mary, was the better child, I knew that, and I was ok with that as she made mom proud. She had higher grades and was more athletic. Me? I was the quiet, shy, artistic child. I could make my mom proud too, but I knew that my sister would always be ahead of me academically. I didn't care. I just continued with my studies quietly, working towards getting into art college. 

However, last week there was an accident in which Mary and three of her friends were involved in a car crash in which an intoxicated driver ploughed head-on into the car Mary was driving. The two girls in the front, Mary and her best friend, were killed, two girls in the back were badly injured and the third one sustained bad brain injuries, causing her to go into a near-vegative state.

Mom was devastated, obviously, I was too. I mean, this was my twin who died, my other half, and it was completely out of nowhere. It wasn't as though she died from an illness that was wearing her down overtime. It was sudden. So many years gone just like that. 

After the funeral (attended by mom, our father with his new wife whom mom had allowed to come to the funeral, our grandma and grandpa and various cousins, aunts and uncles and friends) mom began acting strangely. She would call for Mary and then break down, remembering she was dead. I tried to help her, really I did, but whenever I offered my help it was as though I wasn't there. She looked right through me. I tried contacting various experts, but they all said that this was just grief. Mom would get better and accept that Mary was at peace in time.

Then yesterday, it started.

I had walked downstairs and my mom looked different. Since the funeral, she had been wearing the same things and hadn't taken care of herself- again, I tried to help her, but she didn't accept my help at all- but now she was clean, her hair was washed and brushed, and she was wearing her best blouse and skirt, and she was acting like she did before Mary's passing.

When she heard my footsteps, she turned around and smiled.

"Oh! Good morning Mary!" She had said. I was confused.

"Mom, Mary is dead, remember? We had her funeral a few days ago." I had replied. She kept smiling, her eyes faraway and vacant.

"Oh don't be silly, Mary. If we had your funeral, you wouldn't be here!" 

"Mom," I had replied gently, "I'm not Mary. She died in a car crash last week. I'm Stella. Remember?"

"Stella was the one that died. Sit down Mary, I'll make your favourite breakfast. Eggs on toast, right?" Mom was rooting around in the fridge as she spoke.

"I'm Stella. I hate eggs. Mom, accept that Mary is dead!"

Then Mom changed. 

"Mary. You are here. You are my daughter. You will never leave my side like Stella did. If you do, I will hunt you down and bring you back. I will hunt you across the earth if I have to. You are my child. You are mine."

I was scared, so I played along with Mom's delusion. It was heartbreaking to watch. She put all my things, all my art supplies and clothes, in the attic. She made me wear Mary's clothes. Mary is slightly skinnier than me so the clothes were tight and uncomfortable. This happened all day. She wouldn't let me leave her side.

I don't know what to do. I know Mom needs some serious mental help, but I'm scared of what she might do to me if I try and contact anyone. And I'm scared of her as well. I can't go anywhere. She won't let me leave the house without her. I'm basically a prisoner, and Mom is chaining me to her. What the hell do I do?

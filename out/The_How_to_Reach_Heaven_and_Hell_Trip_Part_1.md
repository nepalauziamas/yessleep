Let me start off by saying, don’t do drugs, they’re bad. They ruin your health, your relationships and often they can take your life. Not even if they’re from a friend you trust. My story will take you through a journey from doing a drug that was given to me by my best friend Adam. This journey actually brought me to Hell and Heaven, and I met both the Devil and God. Now this isn’t like your typical Dante’s Divine Comedy, there are no circles of Hell or Heaven. They’re not even places , but they are at the same time. I’ll explain more on that later.

To preface the journey a little, Adam and I had been friends for the last 10 years. We met when I got my job at the Auto factory which we’ve worked virtually every afternoon together a decade ago. You had two choices in our town when you were done Secondary School, work at any of the big three automotive plants or move away. Adam’s and  mymutual love for dark humour and similar upbringings made us very close friends. He was the one who introduced me to LSD. It was a fun time, enhanced colours, and sounds, a minute can seem like a half hour, which makes you appreciate the time you do have on this spinning ball, and it brings you to the realization that life goes to fast and before you know it , a decade has past. That’s also the kind of introspective things that you experience in the drug. We’d do it a few times a year, mainly now for introspective lessons you learn. Most people just do it because they want to see cartoons in front of their eyes like they see in the movies. I’ll tell you right off, that does not happen and any dealer or person that tells you that is lying right to your face.

One day Adam came up to me at work, and said “Dave, when we clock out, let’s go back to my place, I have some new Lucy for us to try, apparently it’s out of this world strong”.  People call LSD “Lucy” because of a fictional correlation people made back in the day about the famous Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds”. Anyways I agreed, as it was a Friday and my wife was out of town visiting her Mother, it was the perfect time to unwind, hangout with my best friend, and go a psychedelic trip. 

At 11 PM we clocked out, I got in my car and met Adam at his apartment. Adams apartment was your typical Hippie apartment, bong on the coffee table, half empty bag of Cheetos on the couch right next to the PS4 controllers, and his placed constantly smelled of Marijuana smoke. Kind of the perfect place to go on a “trip”. It’s repulsive to people have have cleanliness standards, but to a stoner it’s “homey” and “comfy”. 

“So apparently this new stuff is pretty strong?” I said to Adam, wanting to start the trip as soon as possible as your usually strapped in for 12 hours with not much you can do about it. “Dude, the homie I got this off said you’d meet God on it it’s so strong” replied Adam. I chose to mean that as it was strong, as there’s a general understanding in the LSD/Psychonaut community that you can not actually die from taking LSD. You can have a Bad Trip if you take too much , or are not in the right head space, but never die.

Adam continued “But I’m sure that’s just what he says so he can justify charging me triple the going rate, but with how dry the market has been recently, what choice do I have?” 

So we both only usually only take one standard dose of LSD because we wanna vibe and just have a good time. We don’t necessarily be drooling incoherent vegetables the whole time, it’s exhausting.

I help Adam get the room ready for the experience, dim the lights, get a few bottles of water for us, water is super important when you’re “tripping”. So Adam tears off a tab for me and we put the tabs under our tongue for 10 minutes then swallow them. We start playing FIFA on the PS4, as we are waiting for the effects to kick in , which usually takes anywhere from 30-60 minutes. Not 10 minutes in, I start feeling the effects, things are a lot funnier then usual and everything around me just looks crisper, like someone lifted a filter on our eyes, this is pretty common with psychedelics, but not this fast usually. Things were getting so crisp and so surreal so fast that it was starting to be overwhelming. “Oh no a bad trip, not what I wanted after a long days work” I thought to myself. I looked over at Adam, he had a similar look on his face, one of minor regret and uncertainty. All of a sudden, as quickly as the side affects came on, blackness. This is not normal, you do not blackout on Acid. I

 start to hear the sounds of demonic laughter and screaming, it sounds like mine and my Mother’s then it stops abruptly . The blackness slowly receded and turns into my childhood home. It’s like I was asleep and I woke up here. Half groggy and  confused I half half heartily thought to myself “Okay , apparently Hell is the first stop on this trip.” 

“That’s right” a disturbing gravelly yet soothing voice said behind me, “You couldn’t be anymore correct , Welcome to my Kingdom, this is your Hell.”

How did that man know what I was thinking? 
I know I didn’t say anything aloud. I came to the realization that this is the Devil. “That is also correct David, but please I don’t like being called a Devil, please just refer to me as Lucifer.”

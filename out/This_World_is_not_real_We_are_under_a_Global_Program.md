Hello all, I really did not know who to talk to about this or discuss and always kept everything to myself and wanted to seek other people here, their thoughts on what I am about to share. 

About me:
I am financially doing well I believe. Most likely due to the certain gut instincts and some visions to detect current events allowing me to position to take some financial advantage etc.. I am able to assimilate into society and no one would bat an eye on this is what I experienced and think.

I do not have social media. I do not own a TV. I do not watch netflix or movies or any shows because it may influence my thoughts. I whole heartedly believe the Bible is the most significant source of Truth. (Logical derivative proof but this post is not about that.) 

Earlier this year I had visions and they all came true. (Have proof to this as well a year before they manifested or happen not wild guesses or generalizations in order to hit or miss but specific) including mass suicides, war, energy crisis, neighbors to kill each other, high divorces coming, low population, collapse of EU/Asia, greatest financial wipe out in history, surging unemployment, implementation of univeral basic income, and much more.  

On Sept 1st, 2022 I had a vision of dark gray clouds, energy crisis emerging and mass suicides. Few days later a CFO of a company commits suicide in NYC and in Russia there is another suicide killing an abassador. 

On September 5th, 2022, I had a very traumatizing vision while laying in bed where I saw a Being with what appears to be a silver metallic solid face with a black plain garnament up to the shoulders. Had no height or anything below. It appears I may have been in a spirit form because I was behind His shoulders and there I could see a what appeared to be a laptop screen. I saw he was plotting future global events of this World. Then I knew it. We are not in a simulation but a massive Global Program. I saw lives of other humans crying, running, etc and he was able to control all that aspect. To be more precise I am afraid. I saw a military aircraft firing. I saw a tall building on fire. And more importantly I saw our Earth the top right half of it in flames and destroyed. I do not think I was supposed to see that because when He finally noticed me the Programs turned off the screen went black. He faced me and spoke. The language or sound was very high pitched and very strong. So strong I can physically see the vibrations and waves in the air. I was scared and came back to this World. I was catching yet another seizure. I was only out for 11 minutes because the last text I sent a friend was 11 minutes before I entered this trance. 

I am so confused, traumatized and I almost forgot to walk or lost feeling of my muscles when I got out of the vision. I stayed frozen and stuck for hours. Felt dizzy.  

He was in a white room with no door. Hows that possible? He was focusing on main screen program opened what appeared to be like a poor country..sandy desert like but hispanic type people.. yelling crying. Moms children killed. Military . Fire buildings. With what appeared to be a very slim desk floating in the air with that screen on top of it. I have always remained a skeptic. Question everything and anything. I have realized how close we are with nature. The finger print to tree stumps. Our lungs to tree leaves and river streams. And I believed this to have been the wonders of God in the Bible... I have no idea if I was in spirit form in the vision how I can even view things like in this physical world. 

I never in my wild thoughts imagined this can happen. Couple things I left out. I do not take any form of drugs. I have always been seeking the truth since I knew I had a conscious as a kid. I circled back from being raised as a Christian to becoming purely skeptical and then now seeking a relationship with the Father I believe is in the Bible. I always take care of my mind by taking care of my body. Currently at the gym now, and have been going every single day more than 1000 days straight with no days off. (Have gym check in data to show this) 
Health is the greatest wealth. Life at zero sum game. All things you worked for can be wiped out on a single event especially health. Care for it!!

I have lot of philosophical thoughts and psychological concepts always forming. But this vision I never could have imagined coming. 
I am dumbfounded and eager only because this vision goes against my personal belief and my journey to God. So please anyone with very high academia or similar visual experience I would love to hear your thoughts.

What I got out of this was. We are in a mass global program. I saw files of the occult, symbols, signs and even religion and they could be uploaded to this world. Theres multiple layers of illusion and a very big grand illusion where this is where the World believes in it as a single universal truth. I used to get visions very rarely and when I do get them they always came true in world current events (have proof to this since I always jot down visions as soon as I have them) I may want to go for one or two more but I am afraid of it since everytime I awake from the visions I go through these seizures or heart attacks. I am afraid I am risking my life here in order to keep confirming my curiosity.. 

I would write more (writing this on mobile), but I think this is far as it goes. I may even remove this post. If anyone has any questions. Literally anything please post and I will respond to each and everyone. 

My life philosophy was always dont do what the world does nor believe. I have rejected many chances of relationships which other guys would most likely be jealous for. I opted out of many activities just because of my moral compass today. 

I spoke to therapists and they do not see anything wrong with me. Sophomore year of HS I had an IQ of near 141. College courses in engineering. Quantum physics. Programming and engineering math. Tuition was fully coverer, every single year in top honors in GPA, my dorm and food yearly was even covered jusr as an example. I am sure even with an MRI it will not tell any different story. So if anyone has any insights please let me know.

I have never shared this with anyone in my life. I always been an observer and introvert. I kept my beliefs to myself at all times, but after yesterday I simply do not know if I want to be in this fake World. 

One last thing. It is harder to prove this world is real than it is easier for me to prove this world is not. 

Our eyes have filters [380 to 750nM] and our ears have limitations in HZ [400-790 tHz] that prevent us from seeing out of the range or it may explode our brains [literally]  the brain calls this the reticular system (filteration) it is not what we can see that is important but what we can not.. 

We are about to head into the worst crisis we ever had in human history and this relates to the global world financially, physically, and spiritually. 2023 will be one of the toughest years...however the light shines brightest in the dark and we will make it through..hopefully..

 And I always think to myself what if even that was part of the grand illusion that was programmed even amongst the most intelligent?... this is not personal experience but a broad and the world current events that will soon unravel will prove this vision to be valid.. i hope everyones prepared.. 

Love to hear your thoughts..

Edit: i am planning on taking this post down soon. My purpose was not to prove God is real nor the high chance this world may not be real but simply get intellectual feedback on the specific vision that contradicted my beliefs. If there are any physicist or well known philosopher or someone in the theology sector or even into the occults i am open for feed back!! Thanks for all your comments. Good or bad. Hate or love!

It is not a coincidence that it appears many humans today have feelings of brokenness. 
-fear
-empty
-hopeless
-unproductive
-souless
-unmotivated
-depressed
-suicidial
-anger
-cognitive dissonance
-lost
The spiritually awaken will see signs and symbols no longer words or science or religion. 

It is not a coincidence inflation will cause people to start eating more fast food causing severe health problems and brain malfunction. Leading to mind control. Cancers. Depression. Suicide. Cognitive dissonance. 

Coincidences do not repeat itself constantly... And people were asking for signs from God. .. to show he exists.. was right there..everywhere.. above below..around..nature 

In quantum physics, reality does not exist, if you are not observing it.

We all live in our own world or assume a reality based on our circle
There are roughly 7.75B people on Earth. If the average person has 9 friends, there are roughly 861.4 million different worlds/realities.

Aristotle was one of the first scientists. He was also a very intelligent philosopher. Next time you degrade the importance of philosophy. Remember the bullshit so called science has stemmed from Aristotle who was the 1st scientist but a highly intelligent philosopher.. 

Philosophers think concepts beyond the physical world.  Evil has corrupted science. 

Accounting and book keeping is not actual finance but childs play that only serves to enslave humans from ever understanding true flow of money but dial into pencil whipping a bunch of useless garbage. Another distraction. True finance is funnel of money moving to organizations programmed to enslave humans by giving them more power over rules and regulations. Accounting to keep in compliance with whom? IRS. Tax laws mainly for theft. Accounting teaches nothing. Has no purpose of bigger meaning. Just moving numbers up down left right in order to calculate how much u owe IRS a programmed entity. It is not of coincidence the IRS and Fed reserve was created the same time in 1913. And created most of today's issues. 

Just because the whole world does not see nor understand does not mean they are right and you are wrong.

The world hated Jesus thousands of years ago.
Now humans today used Jesus and created fake religion called catholic and christian. 

Christianity is the #1 religion in this entire World. 
Start again. 

It is the one that is walking against the crowd whom appears to be crazy. 

Those who have the urge to leave you are crazy comments. What is crazy? People that do not agree with your set of illusions? 

I personally believe the greatest weapon a Human can hold is studying and mastering psychology, philosophy, and finance..notice I did not say science.. religion nor history.. I am not much of a conspiracy theorists..most dervied from drugs and typically extreme rights or trump supporting Qanon or wrecks like Alex Jones. Convincing with circumstantial evidence but lacks solid logic and evidence. 

I was finally able to get a rough sketch of this Entity so if anyone has any insight please comment! If anyone knows how I can post photos please let me know

Thank you all! (And the mods that allowed me to post this.)

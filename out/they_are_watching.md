It was 3:00 in the afternoon and I was exited for my best friends party tommorow. My mom reminded me "honey, you need to wash the dog but first take him out" "yes ma'am " I returned. 

Mom had a very mad face when I hadn't washed the dog yet. She demanded I go out and watch him. I had no choice. I wish I did. 

While I was out I looked around and saw a black van. The moment I saw it the van sped off dropping something in the mailbox. I crept towards the mailbox. Approaching it like it was a hostage situation. 

I opened the mailbox slowly to see a DVD disk inside that read "open me now OP". I was shocked, how did they know my name? Who were these people? Why did they choose me? 

Despite what danger I could be in I kept the mysterious disk. Once I got done with washing my old dog rascal I said" hey mom does that old DVD player still work? " she returned with "I think we threw it away. "

I though hard then I remembered, my Xbox plays DVD's I knew what I had to do. I locked my door and put the DVD in.

The DVD played a VHS format witch had been converted via at home recording. As a result the video was very vauge and problematic but I could understand what was happening nonetheless

My jaw dropped. There was a bloody battered man hanging upside down above what I presumed was water. My mistake as a second later he was dropped in revealing the "water" was actually battery acid. 

His skin started swelling and burning and soon enough it popped. A pool of red floated covering the top of the glass vat. As he was drug out I thought "cool prank" I texted my friend and he said he knew nothing about a prank today. 

I heard a knock at the door. I jumped up and turned off the old DVD. It was my sister. 

"What" I peeked out of my cracked door

"Package" she said as she tossed a package with the formats of a DVD 

"Thanks" I said "ugh" she returned 

I closed my door again and looked out the window. The black van was at the corner again. I gulped and opened the package as I kept eye contact with the van. It was another DVD with a message on the back. 

The old paper wrinkeled in my hands as I slowly opened it and read "watch it or your family dies. " This was getting to much for me I grabbed my colt m1911 out of its case and loaded it. 

I walked out with my gun drawn "WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT. " The van again started to drive. 



But it was heading for my houses front door. 


I ran inside. "Mom get down!"My mom wasn't there, I ran to see my sister was gone too. The van had stolen them. Suddenly I saw a TV with a DVD player set up in my floor.

 Once I cleared the house I went back to my room. I put the DVD in and yelled " IS THIS WHAT YOU  WANT" and pressed play. 

I watched helplessly as the man hogtied on the screen tried to free himself. A man with a paper bag and a black suit on came into picture. 

The man was put in a chair across from the paper bag man. I watched as a light across the room lighted up revealing a man in an X position sat nailed to a spinning wheel. The hogtied man is released and forced to spin the wheel 

It is announced that the wheel landed on "comedy." while wondering  what it meant I realised that a malet that looked like it was from a buggs bunny cartoon. The malet is released. 

His head explodes on impact 

I look away. How could someone do this? I think as I see the array of brain and bone matter lying in all the paint-like blood. 

I turn the DVD player off. I hear someone in my closet. In the heat of the moment I say "GO TO HELL"  and shoot. Blood pours over the shavings from the wooden door 

Seconds later I pull open the door and find the suited man dead. I shoot again but miss. I'm threw back by some unseen force. The body is mutilated and pissed as it's new coming host finds me. 

It grabs me. I shoot it as it punches me through a wall. My gun is too far away to grab but I see a hammer on the floor. Probably a failed self defence attempt by my mom. 

I have no time to think while the monster slugs over to me. I grab the hammer and deliver the best punchline I've ever thought of "guess that party is cancelled" And proceed to slam the hammer through the now mutilated and bloody head of the horrible being. Once I'm sure it's dead I call the cops and decide to cover it as a basic home robbery gone wrong because I know no one will belive me

I'm not crazy right?

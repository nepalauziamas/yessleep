Before I could even scream, it was like a spell broke, and everything snapped back to normal. I could hear birds chirping in the trees and kids getting off a school bus somewhere behind me. The breath on my neck was gone. I cast one last glance at the memorial, ready to run back to my car and drive away from this place without looking back, but my heart stopped. The rabbit, the carving on the cross, and the blood was gone. The blood was gone from my wrist, too. I backed away, gripped with fear, and then turned and ran, stumbling over twigs and leaves in my path, running as fast as I could until I made it back to my car and then drove with no direction, no intention, except to get away.

It was over an hour before I calmed down enough to think straight. I had no explanation for what had just happened. I kind of wanted to push it to the back of my head, leave this place, and never think about this again. I drove back to the inn where I'd been staying, planning to pack my bags and leave town immediately. Whatever spooky shit was going on here, I didn't want any part of it. I wasn't an idiot. I wasn't going to be the fool who dies first in the horror movie.

Much to my surprise, Jerry O'Rourke was waiting for me in the lobby of the inn.

"Uh, hi," I said, trying not to sound like I just had the most bone-chilling experience of my life.

He skipped the pleasantries. "I have something for you." He handed me an enormous envelope. "You'll find that most everyone at the station is rather less than eager to discuss this case, but one of my trainees was just promoted, and I called in a favor." He tapped the envelope. "This is everything they have, as far as I know. If you need anything else from the police, ask for Jason." He tipped his hat at me, and left.

I stood in the lobby for five minutes, staring at this envelope in my hands. Five minutes ago, I had been dead-set on getting the hell out of dodge. But I was still a journalist, and an entire police file on the murder I was investigating was too delicious not to at least look at. I brought it up to my room and pored over it.

Before I tell you about the police report, I want to tell you a few other things I dug up about this case that I forgot to mention. My first day here, I paid a visit to the local newspaper archives at the library. There were three articles that I found particularly intriguing:

&#x200B;

>November 5, 2015          **THE KENT GAZETTE**  
>  
>EYEWITNESSES CALL KENT HIGH STUDENTS’ MURDER “PARANORMAL”

The reporter had interviewed two people who had been on the scene right after the bodies were found. Helen Jones’s scream of terror had alerted neighbors, who came running, and a small crowd had gathered by the time the police got there, although most everyone backed away once they realized what they were looking at. Karen McIntyre, a 46-year-old mother of four and local substitute teacher, stated with conviction that this was “clearly paranormal” and “there were forces at work here,” although she didn’t really explain what either of those things meant. She did say, “I think we all know who the police should be looking at right away,” but the article ended there, as though the readers would know whom she was talking about.

>November 17, 2015       **THE KENT GAZETTE**  
>  
>KENT HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS’ DEATHS OFFICIALLY RULED HOMICIDE

Up until the police report, this article gave me the most hard evidence I had so far, and it was bizarre. Although the autopsies confirmed that this was definitely a homicide, no causes of death were officially determined for any of the victims. Which is so weird, because Jerry said that all three bodies bore evidence of brutal, fatal injuries to their heads, necks, and torsos. How could they not tell how they died?

>December 4, 2015        **THE KENT GAZETTE**  
>  
>UNDERAGE SUSPECT ARRESTED FOR HALLOWEEN TRIPLE HOMICIDE

This article didn’t name Victor Knight, but it did describe the suspect as a “disturbed young person” and said that the injuries inflicted on the victims were “consistent with potential murder weapons found in the suspect’s kitchen, basement, and garage.”

&#x200B;

Now, back to the police report. This thing was a mess. There was virtually no organization, which made it very difficult to parse. I found the autopsy report first, and while I could have lived without seeing those photographs, I did learn something very interesting: the bodies were so badly mutilated, in so many different ways, and in such quick succession, that it was impossible for the medical examiner to be certain which injuries were ultimately fatal. In fact, they at first thought the bodies had been partially consumed by animals before they were found, although that was ruled out by the medical examiner. Reading this, I thought, if they were so badly mutilated, how were they even identified? The photographs, unfortunately, answered this question for me: the bodies were mutilated, but the faces of the victims were left entirely intact. Whoever did this wanted them recognizable.

The police report told me a few other things I didn't know. There were a number of strange things about the scene. One was that all three bodies had their mouths and pockets stuffed with whole, peeled cloves of fresh garlic. The dirt around them had been marked, as though someone were writing in it with a stick, but not in a language anyone recognized. And the scene was littered with dead animals. I shivered, thinking of the rabbit. That spot in the woods was full of dead squirrels, rabbits, chipmunks, birds, and so on, and for weeks, as though every small creature in the area died suddenly. The police report described some of them as having "unusual wounds," which made me think of the rabbit's slit throat, but others seemed to have simply fallen out of the trees, dead as doornails. It seemed that no one bothered to perform any squirrel autopsies to find out what killed them.

The last thing I found in the police report that night was about Victor Knight and the case the police built against him. I've already talked about how Victor was a really big eleven-year-old, and how the victims were really small, especially for varsity athletes. Jerry had told me that Victor's older sister, Haley, was also a cheerleader, and she was bullied by the other cheerleaders and eventually killed herself. The police report gave me more details: Haley was the youngest member of the varsity cheerleading squad, and there was a lot of tension over her because the older members of the team were jealous of her. That's where a lot of the bullying came from, and it seemed like rumors were spread about her with all kinds of vicious lies. Haley was bullied relentlessly by the whole student body, it seemed, and yet she remained on the cheerleading team until the day she died. That seemed so strange to me. If being a cheerleader was the reason she was tormented, why not drop off the squad?

Victor was four years younger than Haley, but he was very protective over her, for some reason. His parents were interviewed by the police and said that Haley was his favorite person in the world and they were very close. He was devastated when she died, and said all kinds of horrible things about hurting the people who hurt Haley. That's where his motive for the murders came from, getting revenge for his sister. However, the Knights' parents also talked about how Haley was profoundly depressed long before the bullying started, long before she tried out for the varsity cheerleading team. They had tried to get her help, but they said it was almost as though she was afraid of something.

*Afraid.* That seemed like such a strange way to describe a depressed person. I sat on the edge of the bed, staring mindlessly out the window into the blackness behind the hotel, thinking. Something moved outside, and I blinked, startled, at the flash of something light-colored outside. But it was gone as quickly as it happened. I stood up and went closer to the window, looking for whatever it was. There was nothing out there, it was just flat blackness. Too black, actually. There was no light, no shadow, no dimension. Just pure, deep blackness. I squinted into it, too confused to be afraid, until two things happened at once.

An ear-piercing scream shattered the room, and at the same moment there was a flash of lightning across the window that caused me to leap back in fright. I collided with the bed and stumbled to the floor. I curled up against the night stand, heart pounding, the echo of the lightning flash emblazoned on the inside of my eyelids. Who had screamed? Was it me? I went to the door and opened it, expecting to see people rushing about, trying to find out who was hurt or what was going on. But there was nothing.

A maid walked by pushing a cart. "Excuse me," I said. "Did you hear that?"

"Hear what?"

"The...you didn't hear anyone scream?"

She shook her head, looking at me kind of weird. "No...?"

I nodded. "Great." I went back into the room and shut the door. What the fuck just happened? I sat on the bed for a minute, the open window like a gaping wound into the darkness. A cold breeze shot through the room and I got up to close the window before it hit me -- why the hell was the window open?

I shut it and went to pull the blinds but before I did I noticed that the hotel windows cast squares of light across the grass, and the stars blinked bright overhead. It wasn't even cloudy. Why was there lightning? Why couldn't I see the lights from the hotel earlier? What the fuck was going on?

I locked the window, pulled the blinds, drew the curtains, and then went to the door and made sure it was locked too. On an impulse, I dragged the dresser over to block the door. Probably a fire hazard, but it made me feel safe enough to get in bed. It was too late to drive home now anyway.

But as I laid in the dark, staring at the ceiling, the image of the lightning flashed in front of me again. And then I realized something I hadn't immediately registered: it wasn't just lightning in the window. In the vague way you remember dreams, like you are certain it happened but can't quite picture it, I remembered a face in the window, illuminated by the bolt of lightning.

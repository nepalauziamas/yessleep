[\[Part 2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ue38yk/im_a_soldier_working_for_the_russian_government/)

Night falls, and the wind blows.

The first, melodic notes of that sinister song are carried across the mountains towards me, and a wave of cold fear shivers through my veins.

I have a couple of Bible passages memorized. It still all seems so bizarre to me, but I mean *hey*, if it works, it works. I mutter them to myself over and over as I watch for any signs of an approaching…

…

…*an approaching* ***what***, *exactly? What AM I fighting here? Demons, I suppose… Or ‘demon’, if Yuri’s theory is correct… But are they? Are they REALLY ‘demons’ in the way that I am to assume they are?*

&#x200B;

That same singing from the previous night ebbs and flows with the tides of the wind. A deep, low line of voice that rumbles the bones, interspersed with harmonious, beautiful chords.

It’s different tonight, though. It’s ever so slightly sharper. It sounds just a little less like a song I am simply *hearing*, as opposed to a song that is being sung to *me*.

&#x200B;

…But for the first *two hours* of the night, nothing further happens. A modest tumble of stone across the gorge sends my heart rate into temporary overdrive, but nothing approaches. Not yet. The tension builds, almost unbearably.

&#x200B;

It isn’t until well into the third hour that I hear Elena’s voice carry across the wind:

“*SIGHTED*”, she shouts, and across the Outpost a blast of dazzling light tears suddenly into the sky.

*Here we* go, I wince, knuckles white on the weapon. A part of me is almost relieved to have that brutal, building tension finally crack.

It’s a far clearer night tonight, and I can see further down the cliffside into the abyss. A ripple of dark wind crashes like water into the mountain down below, and this wind carries with it a shadow, clambering with speed and determination up the rock towards the Outpost walls.

“FUCK!” I shout out loud as I angle the weapon down with a clank, hauling up the lever to the side and taking quick aim. Despite the cold I am sweating, and the forearms of my jacket are currently rolled up to the elbows. The hairs across my forearms all react to the crackle in sudden electricity as I fire, and the spotlight-gun sends a blast of concentrated, sunlight-style energy down towards the approaching assailant.

I miss, and the creature draws closer. I catch glimpses of disturbingly human-like arms and hands bursting from the sides of the demon’s form as it tears up the mountainside. I bring the weapon round with another mechanical clank and the beam passes right through it, bursting the creature into shadowy flakes and smoke.

Pieces clatter from the obliterated demon and rattle back down the rock, and the night is clear enough and the monster *close* enough for me to actually see the cause of the rattling, this time.

…They are *bones*.

As the demon is destroyed, burnt *bones* are sent clattering out from its ruin. Ribs and pieces of spine and… and others, too. They vanish back down into the shadow pretty promptly, but they were bones alright. I’m sure of it.

&#x200B;

And so it goes.

&#x200B;

I do my best to keep the demons in the dark at bay.

&#x200B;

This is my task, this is my duty, and these are my orders.

I cannot help but recall particular words of Kristian’s as I blast these monsters to kingdom come.

“*There was a Sikh stationed here once…He lost his sight, and then the next night, he simply disappeared…*”

*…Disappeared…*

&#x200B;

How? And why? What *happened* to him exactly, here on mountainside?

&#x200B;

One of the Enemy below screams with the wind as the light tears it into a thousand pieces.

&#x200B;

And as the night progresses, as we enter into those hours the furthest from the lights of dusk and dawn, I watch as something clambers steadily up the mountainside *opposite*, not the drop directly beneath me. I mutter a phrase from *Corinthians* and aim the weapon up high with a series of mechanical clicks and clanks. Electricity judders through my veins as the light is sent soaring out towards it, but this demon acts differently to the others.

It is difficult, almost *impossible* to focus on these creatures, such is the fluidity of their forms, but this one is more difficult still. It spreads out wide into the shape of a circle, and the beam passes harmlessly through its centre. I direct the weapon this way and that, but each time the entity on the opposite mountain distorts and shimmers through various, dreamlike shapes to avoid it.

…And by doing so, my faith in the weapon’s ability falters.

&#x200B;

Sweat leaks in little rivulets down my back, and a voice I recognize whispers into my ear. The voice is my brother’s, made all the more alarming by the fact that my brother has been *dead* for ten long years.

“*I miss you, Adam*”, he says.

&#x200B;

*No... it’s not ‘him’. It’s ‘THEM’.*

&#x200B;

My heart pounds in pain and longing, fear and anger. I’d give anything to call back to him. To talk to him one last time, but I cannot, of course. I cannot.

&#x200B;

*‘Two, do not engage verbally or physically with the Enemy’.*

&#x200B;

I shout out the passage from the previous night. The one with the trumpets. A passage of defiance.

&#x200B;

“*Adam, lay down your weapon and come to the edge. The dwellers in the Outpost are lying to you. You seek the truth, and* ***I*** *can provide it”.*

As with before, when my brother’s voice says ‘I’, it comes as two words, sounding as if he is saying ‘we’ with the exact same breath.

I grit my teeth, eyes wide and knuckles cracked as I mutter the passage again and again, over and over, my breath clouding in the blasts of the beam.

My brother’s voice whispers further: “***I*** *know you are scared, and* ***I am*** *sorry for the fears* ***I*** *have caused you… But ask yourself where the true Enemy lies.* ***I*** *seek nothing but safety, sanctuary, and PEACE*”.

But I do not listen. I push aside these intrusive words and battle on through the night, keeping at bay every creeping threat to the Outpost. The beam from another turret comes to my aid, I do not know who’s it is. Kristian’s, perhaps, but it strikes through the shadowy, shape-shifting entity directly across the great gorge and together with the ray of my own light, the demon is obliterated into the night with a shower of smoke and dark, clattering bones.

*So the demons can see inside our heads, then? They can access our memories?*

The prospect is a terrifying one.

I am now decidedly unnerved and panicked. Hearing my brother’s voice again, coming from something other than a recording on an electronic device… It has set me on a new and precarious edge. I thought I had a basic grasp of these creatures, but I am realizing all over again that I don’t have a clue what they’re capable of. Anything could happen now.

&#x200B;

Lights flash in the darkness.

&#x200B;

I hear a voice carried across the roof of the Outpost by a sudden gust of wind. Female. Russian. Elena, no doubt, and I feel a stab of bitter frustration as I swing the mechanical weapon around with a clank.

She’s been here for a long time, that much is clear. How long *exactly*, I’m not sure, but it could be anything up to two months, potentially longer. Charlie’s been here for four weeks, that’s what he said, and he’s NATO, so, surely he should only be doing two? And April seems to be under the impression that Elena has some secrets to hide…

I shake my head and mutter a curse under my breath. The system here seems to be in all sorts of shambles. Perhaps our respective Commands don’t really give a damn, all things considered, provided that the Outpost fulfils its most basic quota of six warm bodies to defend it.

But I digress. Elena has been here a long time, Yuri likely as well. WHY didn’t they warn me about all this? They’ve barely helped at all. What have they done for me, exactly? A soldier putting his life on the line in the face of such un-earthly terror? I’ve been given a brief lecture on fucking *ley lines* from Elena and scarcely a handful of words from Yuri. Maybe they’re just blinded by all the anti-American propaganda they’re spoon-fed day after day. But surely up here on this mountain they’d try to put that to one side, right? *Surely?* In the face of such greater evil?

My forearms ache as I tense them up and swing the weapon down with another metallic creak and clank, electricity sparking as I fire a beam into the darkness below.

“*Destroy all those who curse my soul*”, I recite with jaw clenched. “*In service, I am yours.*

*“Blessed be the Lord, my rock; who trains my hands for war*”.

Mechanical booms of thunder are sent rippling through the valley and the mountains, as the lightning-like flashes alight their rocky edges in the darkness.

…The ‘Lord’, of course, was not quite the one who ‘trained my hands for war’, however. I have the army of the United States of America to thank for that. A not-so-benevolent Lord, if ever there was one. Less ‘Jehovah’, more ‘*Mars*’. But I try not to think about this. Such thoughts, I have found, weaken the effect of the weapon. I try to follow the advice given to me by Kristian. ‘Think *good* thoughts. It helps’. The same advice given to me by the Russian officer who dropped me off on my first night.

&#x200B;

*That ‘first night’ was two days ago, Adam. You’ve scarcely been here for* ***two days***.

Feels like a fucking lifetime.

&#x200B;

But the night goes on, and the battle rages.

And as before, as *always*, thankfully, the darkness recedes, the first glorious shimmer of sunlight rises above the jagged horizon, and the edges of the mountains are washed in faded gold.

I collapse away from the weapon, my back up against the little metal railing behind me. I look down at my hands. They are covered in grime, shaking, and several of the fingers are locked into their positions. To move them causes me pain and I wince as I try to work the bloodflow back into them, and after a concerted burst of effort I clamber to my feet and head across the roof of this section of the Outpost, making my way down the metal ladder and returning into the building.

In a dreary daze I pass by both Charlie and Kristian on my way to my dorm. I nod at them both. Charlie nods back. Kristian even gives me a smile and a clap on the shoulder.

I do as before. I shed my uniform and my coat and I collapse into my bed. I do not even bother to draw the curtains, though it doesn’t particularly matter.

The daylight streaming weakly through the window is not sufficient to wake me from my slumber, and my sleep is deep.

&#x200B;

Deep, and as with the previous night, unsettling.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

I awaken with a groan at 14:00.

2pm. Earlier than yesterday.

There’s no blissful ignorance as I return to the land of the living this morning (*…’afternoon’, I suppose*), and I am instead instantly aware of where I am, and what my purpose is here.

…And what I’ll need to do again tonight.

I groan a little louder, rubbing my hands across my eyes, smelling the grease and grime across them as I do so.

&#x200B;

I need to start washing a little better before bed. This can’t be healthy.

&#x200B;

I clean up and dress for the day, leaving my dorm and heading through the kitchen-canteen to grab some breakfast. A generator hums quietly in one corner as I cook some eggs and beans and bring them through to the main room. To the ‘hexagon’.

Elena is in here, eating something out of a bowl at the side of the room. She glances up from her crossword at my approach, but does not make any kind of greeting. April is in here also, at the room’s opposite side. She’s fiddling with a small radio, the pieces of which lay scattered across one of the tables. “Hey Adam” she says to me. “Good sleep?”

“No”, I reply. “Not really. But it served its purpose”.

“That’s the spirit” she replies as she tinkers. “Say, you aren’t an engineer, are you?”

“No, sorry”.

“No worries. Thought it was worth asking. Yuri is, but you know. He’s a miserable bastard”.

Elena looks up again and swallows her mouthful of food. She jabs the hand with the spoon in it over to where April is sitting. “Yuri will fix your radio. Get off your high horse and ask him. He will do this”.

April snorts and shakes her head. “No he won’t. He’ll swear at me in Russian and leave me to suffer. He isn’t a good person”.

Elena seems to take offence to this. “Yuri does what is best for good of the *Outpost!* You need him to fix radio? He will FIX radio! This is Russian good person. American ‘good person’ means fake smiles and hollow laughter all day twenty-four hours”.

“How very cliché”, I mutter. “A Russian with an anti-Americanism complex”.

Elena’s cold, pale eyes flicker over to mine, and I get the uneasy sense that a great weight was just dropped on top of me. She puts down her bowl and gets to her feet, a slow motion, one that serves to draw out the tension.

…But this woman doesn’t scare me. Not after the horrors of the night.

“You are not typical recruit we get sent here, Adam”, she says. I note that this could be the first time she’s addressed me by my actual name.

“No?” I ask.

“No”. She replies. “You are timid. You have angsty aura. Unsettled. Child-like. You are putting the Outpost coalition in danger with your presence”.

I stare at her, irritated, but doing my best not to seem phased. I force out some laughter and fold my arms. “You’ve got me all wrong. How am I putting the Outpost in danger, exactly? I just helped successfully defend it. You know how many demons I destroyed last night?”

Elena doesn’t respond. She only watches me. Searching me with those arctic eyes.

I shift uncomfortably.

April chimes in. “Oh leave him alone Elena, you bully. He’s doing his best”.

&#x200B;

This seems to make her particularly angry. The ‘bully’ comment. A flash of genuine fury crosses her face and I watch her body twitch. Her fists clench, just for a moment… My throat dries and I get a quick, modest burst of adrenaline…

...But nothing happens. Elena closes her eyes and takes a breath, and then she simply strides from the room. Down one of the corridors and towards another section of the Outpost.

&#x200B;

I un-tense my muscles and bring myself down into a seat near April with a grunt, to actually go ahead and eat my breakfast.

We sit there for a while in comfortable silence, me eating, and April working away at her radio. She presses a button and it cracks and fizzles. She sighs.

“These things are temperamental at best”, she says, shaking it in her hand. “They don’t work like they’re supposed to up here. In this *environment.* And mine’s died completely”.

I look at her. “April, tell me. How long have you been here exactly? At the Outpost”.

Just over a week”, she replies.

“Just over a week… and Charlie’s been here for four, is that right?”

She nods.

“But I thought NATO personnel were only required to do two?”

“Yeah”, she says uneasily. “But you know how it is. They tell you one thing and then they change it. And to be fair, I think Charlie actually *volunteered* to stay longer. I think he wants to do two months, like the Russians”.

“What- why would he want that?”

April shrugs again. “I think he just like the thrill”.

“The thrill…” I shake my head. “And what about Kristian, then?”

“So, Kristian’s been here before. He’s only on his second week right now, but, he keeps coming back. I think he’s been more or less alternating groups of weeks for about a year”.

“A YEAR?”

“Yeah. Maybe more, even”.

*A year… Why would he do that? Why would he keep coming back? Is this of his own choosing, or are his superiors forcing him back all the time?*

…‘*Our*’ superiors, I guess…

“So what about Elena?”

“You sure ask a lot of questions Adam”.

“Well, maybe that’s because no-one *tells* me anything”.

“Okay, okay. Jeez… I don’t know how long Elena’s been here. She won’t tell me. Don’t really know anything about her, but she hates me, that much is pretty obvious. The thing is though, Adam, I think she’s been here for a long, *long* time. Like, really long. You can tell in the way she speaks to Kristian that the two go way back, but I think she’s been here for longer than he has. And I’m not convinced that she’s taking any time off, either. There’s something that scares me about that one, and I’m not just talking about that nasty scar”.

“So, Kristian won’t tell you anything either? Why not?”

“I don’t know. I think that he and the Russians are keeping secrets from us. From the Americans”.

“I don’t get it, why would they do that? And Kristian is a nice guy, he’s a NATO soldier for God’s sake-”

April just puts out her hands.

“Listen, come take a look at this, alright?”

She stands up and checks down the corridor that Elena left through, before beckoning me over to the side of the room, to the section of wall with the little framed photographs across them.

“You wanna see something really weird?”

“I don’t know what could possibly be weirder than what I’ve already seen, but sure. Go for it”.

She leads me through a door in the wall to a small back-room. It’s basically a storage unit with lots of shelves, and it’s full of dusty photographs, many of which have been framed. Some are kept in stacked piles, others hang on the limited wall space. She points to one such photo.

“Take a look at this one. You recognize anybody?”

I squint at it.

It’s a picture of a squad of six people out the front of the Outpost. The enormous weapon on the Outpost’s roof can be seen in the background. In the foreground stand three people, with three others crouched down at the front. Five men, one woman.

They’re all grinning, in this picture, which makes the woman initially quite hard to identify. The quality is unusual also. Quite grainy-looking.

…But the scar, once you think to look for it, is *obvious*. It’s Elena, alright. Her hair’s different, and she seems a bit younger, but she still looks pretty much the same.

“Oh, it’s a picture of Elena. And the rest of the team… They’re all different people”.

“Yeah, but that’s not the weird part. Check this”. April again glances around, peering back out through the door before moving to unhook the picture frame from the wall. She turns it over and adjusts the clips, until she is able to fully slide the photograph out from the frame. She flips it, revealing a scrawled line in pen near the bottom. “Read this”, she says. “Look at the date”.

I take it from her. The handwriting is poor, but in thin black ink are a series of initials, and a date:

&#x200B;

***SGH*** ***1987***

&#x200B;

“S.G.H? 1987?” I furrow my brow at her. “1987?”

“Think about it. That would make this picture *thirty-five years old*. What the fuck are we supposed to take from that? That Elena’s been here for thirty-five years, at LEAST? And I mean, just LOOK at her! You have to be eighteen to join the army, right? So let’s assume that in this picture she is, at the absolute LOWEST, eighteen. Does the Elena you know look like a fifty-three year old woman..?”

“Well, no”, I reply uneasily. “Obviously. Elena isn’t fifty three years old”.

“Then what the fuck is she doing in a picture from 1987?”

I consider this. Flipping it over. Looking from the picture to the writing, and back.

“No way…” I murmur. “This can’t be right. There are loads of good explanations for this. Maybe it’s not Elena. Maybe ‘SGH’ just wrote 1987 on the back for a joke. There’s no way this pic is from so long ago”.

“Why would anybody do that?” April asks me, intently. “Where’s the joke?”

“Well, I don’t know! Maybe it’s a Russian reference. Did anything of significance happen in 1987?” I shake my head. “It’s just pen and paper, April. You can write any old numbers on photographs, doesn’t mean they’re actually *from* that date”.

April grimaces. “There’s something they’re not telling us, Adam. The Russians. They’re keeping something from us, and if I was a betting woman I’d say it had to do with the Outpost”.

I consider this as we return back into the main room. As April and I shoot the shit and talk about our lives back home. She’s from a little further south than I, she comes from a little town just outside St Louis’. I don’t think she particularly likes it there very much, based on the way she talks about it. Maybe that’s why she joined the army.

Eventually she heads off to relieve Yuri from his tower duty, and I decide to wander the complex. I head from room to room, spending most of this period in an old equipment storage facility. It’s full of musty, dusty old climbing gear. Harnesses, carabiners and ropes, all that stuff. I recognize one such set as standard US Army issue, and it’s as I’m investigating these items that Charlie’s head appears suddenly from around the doorway. I jump in alarm.

“Afternoon mate”, he says with a grin, then a bottle of vodka appears in his hand. He shakes the bottle and the liquid sloshes about in the glass. “Fancy a quick drink?”

I hesitate.

“Uh… I don’t know, man”, I tell him. “Is that really such a good idea?”

“Come on”, he says. “Just a little. Just to wet the whistle. One or two”. He gives the bottle another tempting shake.

I hesitate.

“…Sure”, I reply after a beat. “Why not”.

&#x200B;

\*

&#x200B;

A few hours pass. These hours comprise myself, Charlie, and Kristian sharing one or two modest drinks in the Hexagon. Yuri partakes also, though he keeps to himself and sits by one of the room’s windows, nursing thirstily from a bottle.

“*Vkusno*”, he mutters to himself as he finishes it off, dropping the bottle to the floor with a glassy clank and staggering up and out of his seat, stumbling towards the low little table that Kristian, Charlie and I are sat around to grab another to take away.

“But that’s just- just the thing, lads. Listen! I’m serious, listen-” Charlie slurs as I knock over a can of questionable Russian beer with the back of my hand.

Kristian interrupts with his best impression of Charlie’s accent:

“For real lads! Oi’m not kiddin’ ya, it’s a bloody mess alroite!”

Alcohol splurts from my lips as I struggle to hold back laughter, and Charlie slams a fist down onto the table with rich amusement, sending the hordes of glasses and cans rattling and knocking into each other. One or two of the emptier cans fall on their sides and roll to the floor.

“If you weren’t such a nice bloke I’d knock you the fuck out, Kristian!” he says, just a little too loudly.

Kristian shakes his head and wipes some froth from his beard, then waggles his finger in Charlie’s face. “No, no you wouldn’t my friend. Such violence is not for the good vibes, yes?” he corrects himself. “Such violence is not GOOD for good vibes… It disturbs-” he hiccups. “Disturbs the demons”.

“Or dem*on*? Singular? Right, Yuri?” I say, leaning back and calling over to the Russian in the corner.

He spits on the ground and waves a hand. “*Mne vse ravn*”, the man mutters.

My mood sours. I throw out a hand. “What’s your problem, man? Why don’t you like me? Gimme a chance for fuck’s sake, I’m doing my best here!”

“Hey, chill out mate”, Charlie says, putting out a hand, a drunken blink rolling across his face from one eye to the other. “Don’t be so American, you know?”

“The hell’s that meant to mean?” I ask him as Yuri staggers to his feet.

“Ay, nothin’ personal, like!” Charlie says, his eyebrows shooting up as he reaches for another sip of vodka. “I just mean like, you know, ‘needing’ to be liked and that. Don’t stress it. He’ll warm to you in time”.

“I’m not sure if he will”, I sigh. “But whatever. Just trying to create a sense of coal- coalition. Looking out for my fellow man. Unity, etcetera”.

Yuri snorts on his way out of the room. “*Pizdato*”, he grunts drily before vanishing out of sight.

I reach for another bottle and take a swig.

Charlie chuckles. “Russians think they’re hot shit because they’ve been here so long. Well, we’ll see. I’m gonna break Yuri’s record, I promise you now lads”.

“What about Elena’s?” I ask him.

The man shakes his head vigorously. “No chance pal. She’s been here for fucking years”.

“So it’s true? Years?”

Charlie shrugs and leans back in his chair, burping. “I dunno mate. I could be exaggerating. Kristian knows her better than I do”.

I turn to him. “Kristian, what do you think? What’s Elena’s story?”

Kristian scratches his beard. “Eh, she has been here a long time, yes”.

“Since 1987?” I whisper, anxiously.

“…1987? What?”

I stare at him.

He stares back, then laughs, taking another big swig of beer. “You’re joking right? I doubt she’s been here since 1987. Not possible, really, actually”.

“So how long HAS she been here then?”

Kristian sighs. “She prefers me to not tell you. She’s a private person. Mysterious. She has lots of history. I think she finds peace up here, away from the world”.

“Peace? Up HERE! On demon mountain!”

“Demon Mountain”, Charlie snorts. “I like that one. Sounds like a ride at bloody Disneyworld”.

“And think about it- DEMONS! We’re fighting DEMONS up here!” I shout, throwing out my arms and knocking a bottle to the floor with a clatter. “WHY haven’t we all acknowledged how batshit crazy that is!”

“We have mate, we’ve just been through what you’re throughing- fuck, *going* through, already”, Charlie says, pointing his bottle at me and clapping me on the shoulder. “You’re doing good mate. Just keep the demons out. Don’t let them into the Outpost. Don’t use weaponry outside the boundary, etcetera”.

“…A demon spoke to me in my brother’s voice last night”, I mutter quietly, and the guys share a quick glance.

“…What did he say?” Kristian asks.

“He told me that it only wanted… *peace*. That I should ask myself who the ‘true enemy’ are…”

“You didn’t respond, did you mate?” Charlie asks in a sudden panic.

“Of course he didn’t! Kristian interjects. “You think we’d be sitting here so casually right now if he did!”

“So- so what happens if we DO respond?” I ask nervously in a low voice. “If they DO get into the Outpost?” I lean forwards. The other two do likewise.

They look at each other as the wind blows beyond the walls of the complex. It’s snowing this evening. Might be a cold one tonight.

“A demon got into the complex once before with you, didn’t it Kris?” Charlie asks the Norwegian, and the man nods.

“…That was a terrible night, Adam. One of the worst nights of my life”. He sighs and sets his bottle back onto the table. “And believe me, I’ve had some low quality nights. Elena was there also. It was like… like taking away the mosquito net, by the banks of a tropical river”.

Charlie nods sombrely and takes another sip, staring off into space. “Poetic, mate”.

I press him. “And how LONG ago was this worst night of your life? When was this, *exactly?*”

Kristian rubs his fingers over his eyes. “I am not sure. Two years, maybe”.

“Two years… So you’ve been here that long?” I ask him.

“No”, he replies. “I come and go”.

I consider this.

&#x200B;

…So that confirms some of what April was saying earlier. Kristian comes and goes. Elena has been here for at least two years. Quite likely longer. I need more. I need *more* information.

&#x200B;

“And Elena-”, I begin, whispering now, though Charlie seems amused by this.

“It’s alright mate!” he slurs. “She ain’t gonna hear you! Speak your mind”. He winks at Kristian. “I certainly know what’s on MY mind, lads”. He puts his hands out in front of his chest, making the international gesture for ‘massive boobs’.

This sets Kristian roaring with laughter, and I cannot help but join in.

“Charlie!” Kristian laughs. “You are a bad man! You shouldn’t speak like that of our comrade”.

“What?” Charlie says defensively, giving us his best ‘innocent’ face. “I’m just sayin’, I’d love to have a go on those fuckin’ tits!” He elbows me. “Eh? Wouldn’t you Adam?”

I laugh drunkenly and shrug. “I’m not sure man, she kinda scares me!” This sets the guys laughing even harder. “Though, I suppose…” I put on my best British accent. “She does ‘ave a lovely big pair of KNOCKERS!”

&#x200B;

“What the FUCK is going on in here?” says Elena from just behind me, and the three of us shout out in alarm and stagger up to our feet in an instant; bottles and glasses clinking and knocking and tipping, rolling noisily across the little table and clattering to the floor.

She stares with fury at the enormous collection of bottles and emptied cans across the table, chairs and floor. She looks between us, her gaze sharp and terrifying.

“You stupid, stupid assholes!” she shouts in her thick accent. “What the hell have you done?” The looks she gives to Charlie and I convey, basically, her disgust… but the glance she gives to Kristian is full of disappointment. I cringe from the second-hand disapproval.

Kristian chuckles awkwardly, “look, Elena, maybe this got a little out of hand-”

“Do any of you idiots know what time it is?” she asks, throwing a hand out towards the window. “We have one hour until sunset! ONE HOUR!”

Tension ripples around the room.

“No”, Charlie mutters, squinting and blinking at his watch. He is the only one wearing one. “No, we’ve got ages, haven’t we? I made it- at least three, or four…” he trails off.

Elena does not say anything. She just puts a hand to her head. “Where is Yuri?” she asks quietly, with her eyes closed. “Tell me he did not have access to this alcohol”.

…No one replies.

“FUCK!” she shouts, “WELL YOU ALL NEED TO SOBER UP! FUCKING QUICK TOO!” She claps her hands in our faces. “MOVE!”

And move we do. Stumbling and tripping, trying to keep out the sudden panic attacking the back of our minds.

&#x200B;

*Shit.* Is all I can think, as I feel the alcohol sweats start to bud across my body. *Shit shit…*

*…Shit.*

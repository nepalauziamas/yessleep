Hello again, everyone. You all seemed to really enjoy my last story about what is, admittedly, [one of the creepiest experiences of my life.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vy8i6a/ive_been_an_emt_for_a_while_now_and_ive_seen_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) I'm glad! Silver linings and what-not. Thank you all for the kind words and compliments. I figured I'd gather you all around the virtual campfire and share another story, if you'll have me. 

For those of you that are new, I've been an EMT for a good many years now. I've seen a lot. Good, bad, funny, sad and smelly. I work in a pretty high call volume agency, so you name it, I've probably seen it. That said, there's been many times where I've seen things that I still struggle to wrap my head around. Things that didn't quite add up, things that didn't make sense, and some things that, to be frank, *creeped me the fuck out.*

This is one of those stories. I'm not sure what to call it, so we'll just dive right in. 

This story starts out the same way as the last, really. Another extremely busy day, except a little bit darker, because I was on nightshift at the time. The flavor of the night appeared to be psych calls. Maybe it was a full moon or something making people act crazy? Heck, I don't remember. But the wild ones were out and to be honest, I was having a blast. 

It may sound harsh, or mean, maybe even unprofessional, but psych calls are my favorite. It's like a box of chocolates, except the box of chocolates smoked meth, and now thinks that the cashier at the local gas station is *for sure* the wizard that's been casting spells to get his power turned off. 

You just never know what you're going to get.

So I'm questioning my life choices a little bit less than normal when we get a call for *another* psych. The CAD notes read as follows:

02:34:09 UNKNOWN PROBLEM, PSYCHIATRIC, INCIDENT LINKED TO PD, STAGE****

02:36:12 PD STATES CALLER HEARING VOICES***

[PROQA KEY QUESTIONS]
1. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THEY ARE VIOLENT.
2. NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED.
3. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THEY ARE ALONE
4. IT IS NOT KNOWN WHERE THEY ARE NOW.
5. NO PRIOR DATA AVAILABLE

This one was shaping up to be interesting. A few things stood out to me from these notes; "STAGE" meant that, for whatever reason, the scene was deemed to be unsafe, and we were to park some distance away until PD cleared us to enter. That always promises something interesting. "NO PRIOR DATA AVAILABLE" indicates that we've never been to this address before for any prior incidents. We've got no prior history to go on. So my interest, as you can imagine, is peaked. 

Off we go. It's a short ride to the neighborhood where the call came from. It's a newer development; nice houses, mostly rich folks from out of state. Not our usual clients for this sort of call.

We parked the ambulance at a Walmart that was close by, and then proceeded to wait until we got the "all clear" from the police.

When we were cleared to enter, we pull into the neighborhood and follow the blue flashy lights until we get to the scene. PD guides us inside a very nice house, and we find our patient, a 50-ish year old dude sitting in his living room. He is visibly shaken, and at first glance looks as if he hasn't slept in about a year. So I go over to talk to the guy and try to get a feel for what we're working with.

"Hey man, I'm TA2556. I'm an EMT. Can you tell me a little bit about what's going on today?"

"You gotta get me out of here. You gotta get me the *fuck* out of here."

"Okay, yeah man, we can do that. But you gotta tell me what's going on so I know how to help, okay?"

"I can't, we- dude we just, we just gotta go come on, take me to the hospital."

At this time, I wasn't really sure what was up. He's breathing fine. He isn't injured. He's clearly distressed, but I don't know why. I'm about to proceed with my assessment, when out of nowhere, this *awful* yelling comes from directly above us. It's like someone is literally trying to scream their own head off. Stuff starts hitting the ground, like whoever is up there is just throwing things all over the place. The guy flinches, and then starts pointing at the officers, who look absolutely dumbfounded for some reason.

"See! I told you! I *fucking told you* now please man, we got to get out of here!" At this point he's openly sobbing.

The officers immediately go upstairs to see what's going on, and I decide to take my patient to the ambulance. My partner helps me get him loaded up, and then goes to talk to the cops. I start taking vitals, doing my thing, yada yada, and I'm trying to get to the bottom of this.

"So who is that upstairs? Have you been fighting?"

The dude just shakes his head and doesn't respond.

"Are you hurt?"

He just continues sobbing and doesn't respond.

So, it's a domestic dispute. I'm wondering why we're even here at this point, because medically, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with the guy. He hasn't said a word about hearing voices like the CAD notes said. I look outside and see my partner talking to one of the officers. They both look concerned, and I'm still wondering why we're even here. The other officers who went upstairs to check it out had already stepped back outside, both looking confused. About that time, I heard another scream, loud as *shit,* coming from the house.

The police officers and my partner all flinch, and the officers who had just came back outside looked like they had just seen a ghost. My patient sobs even louder, and starts begging us to get him out of there. My partner speed walks to the ambulance and lets me know that he's gonna get us on the way to the nearest hospital. 

This is out of character for my partner. Normally we both sit in the back, get the paperwork and demographics squared away, and, along with the patient, determine which hospital we're going to. That's protocol. Not tonight. He just nods, indicating something is *very* much up, and hops in the driver's seat. As we're pulling off, I hear one more scream. The scream sounds...dark? If that makes sense. Just angry. Hateful. Loud, of course, to be able to hear it over the running diesel engine, but just *angry.* All of the officers I can see through the back window of the ambulance are just talking among themselves, having taken several steps away from the house.

I try to get a history from the guy on the way to the hospital but he's not responsive. He just sobs into his hands the whole way there. Vitals are stable, but elevated. Heart rate and blood pressure are up, obviously, but not alarmingly so. I call it in to the ER as an "altered mental status" due to the lack of patient interaction, because I basically have nothing else to go on. 

We get to the ER and if it wasn't for my patient's reaction, I'd have thought I'd imagined it. But as we're unloading this dude, I hear *another* scream, just faintly, as if it was coming from several blocks away. I'd normally have shrugged it off as my imagination, but my patient just starts shaking and crying loudly. He's inconsolable at this point, and the receiving providers ended up having to give him a little something to calm him down. We get him settled, and I return to my ambulance. I go up to my partner, who still has a look of bewilderment on his face.

"What the fuck was that all about?" I ask him.

"It was empty." He says, and just looks at me.

"What was empty?"

"The house, bro. The house was empty." Then he gave me the scoop.

Apparently this guy had called the cops, claiming he was in danger and that they had to come help him. The police dispatcher could hear screaming in the background, so they'd dispatched it as a domestic. Two officers responded, and when they got there, they searched the house, but couldn't find anybody except the one guy. He had asked the cops why they couldn't hear the screaming still, and he kept swearing "she's upstairs, can't you hear her?"

At that point, they called for another officer and then us, because, well, it seemed like an "us" problem. When we got there, and heard the original scream, that's when they heard it for the first time, too. They had already cleared the house once, but after hearing the scream for themselves, they of course went to clear it again.

The house was totally empty. They found a mess upstairs, stuff thrown all over the place where it had been neat the first time they searched it, but nobody. Every nook, cranny and closet searched yielded nothing. And it wasn't like this was a confusing house layout, I mean it was a big house but really simple, kinda cookie-cutter. Not a lot of places to hide. 

So we talked about how creepy *that* was for the rest of the shift.

Fast forward to the following evening.

You make a lot of friends in this line of work, and one of mine happens to be my buddy Kevin, an RN at the hospital we dropped our guy off at last night. Kev actually took the receiving report from me the night before when we brought him in, and so when I saw him again, I couldn't help but ask.

"Hey man, what the hell was up with that one guy we brought in last night?"

From the look on his face, he already knew the one. He pulled me aside, and gave me *his* scoop.

The patient had been found dead in his room shortly after we left.

Everything was normal at first. He was taking a little ketamine nappy-nap and all was well. Apparently, sometime around 3:45 am, the charge nurse and some techs heard his door *slam* shut, and then this awful screaming. Kevin heard it too, and responded with the rest of them to the patient's room.

"It scared the shit out of me, man. All quiet and peaceful and then *bam,* just someone wailing like a banshee. Sounded like an angry woman, I thought. So I took off down the hallway and when I saw what room it was, I was confused, because no visitors had come for this guy and he was all by himself."

He gestured to the room, which was now empty.

"It was the wildest shit I'd ever seen, man. The door had like, slammed shut. It took four of us to open it. We thought he was holding it shut, but it kinda seemed like it was just jammed on something. I mean, even the strongest meth heads aren't *that* strong, ya know? We open the door and he's just...dead."

I was kind of shocked. The guy seemed totally stable on the way to the hospital. I mean, shit happens, but still. Kevin continued.

"He was slumped over in the corner, and he had no fingernails. It looked like the dude tried to *claw* his way out of the room, man. Scratch marks all over the wall and shit. His head was just...wrong, at this odd angle, just staring up at the opposite corner of the room. He looked terrified, eyes just bulging out of his head."

I could visibly see the chills rising on my friend's arms as he spoke. This is not an easy man to shake; former military, dudes been an RN in the ER for 10+ years and has seen it all. Not much left to shake him, really. What he said next gave *me* chills, and still does to this day.

"His fucking neck was broken. He was in there alone, went in without a broken neck, and we found him with one. How the hell did that happen?"

And that's the last I heard of it. I never got any further updates, honestly work got so busy I forgot to ask. I hadn't thought about this story in a while until I saw Kev at the hospital recently and it reminded me. I need to ask him sometime about whatever came of that call, next time I run into him I'll be sure to mention it.

That's all I have for today, but stay tuned. I have several more and I'm honestly having a great time writing these down! Really helps with the processing and I've been sleeping a lot better. Thank you all for reading along, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on exactly who, or what, we were dealing with that night. I still have no idea.

Until next time, y'all stay safe out there.

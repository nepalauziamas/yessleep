At the moment I'm bored and rifling through books at the library, looking for something entertaining to read. The book I'm currently holding is about weird creatures in nature.

I stop at a page describing something called "Cyclocosmia", it's a scary looking large spider with a dark body, but the most disturbing thing about it is that it looks like it's back part has been cut in half to be completely flat, and it's grown some bizarre symbols in that area.

How odd. Apparently it digs itself into sand, and once some hapless insect walks by it, the spider jumps up and drags it down into the depths to consume it. I think it uses the bizarre flat part of the body as some sort of defense against predators. I was about to read more of the book, but then I saw three revolting spider legs sticking out from a place near the end.

Ew, someone must've smushed a spider in the book. I quickly drop it on the table I was previously sitting at and make my way out of the library. It's dark out, so I take a look at the clock that hangs above the entrance. It's nine, but what stops me short is that there are five arachnid legs surreptitiously sticking out from behind the clock.

There is a spider hiding under the clock.

I'm not the first person to have seen something like this, there were pics on the internet of spiders hiding behind clocks, but it's still unsettling and revolting to see in real life.

It's not revolting in the sense that I want to kill all spiders, I don't, it's just revolting in the sense that something dangerous and unnatural from yourself is trying to trick you by hiding behind a familiar appearance.

I hurry away from the library towards the bus station. There's a guy standing there in a hoodie. I wonder if he's going to try to strike up a conversation, but then I see he has earbuds on and is listening to music.

While waiting for the bus I notice a hundred dollar bill on the ground near the guy's shoe, "How lucky!", I think at first, but then I wonder who could have dropped it? Maybe it was him. I hate talking to strangers, but I hate feeling guilty even more, so if this is his money I don't want to take it. I have to ask him about it.

His eyes are closed so I try shaking his arm a bit, but he doesn't budge, so I gather my courage and decide to take off one of his earbuds. Yes, it's rude, but what's more rude? Stealing a hundred dollars from a stranger?

As I drag the earbud out by the cable I notice something strange, there is no music playing, it's completely quiet. He had just been standing there in complete silence. I want to ask him if he's awake when I see it.

There are seven spider legs sticking out from the guy's hoodie, just around his stony face.

I scream and run all the way home.

Now it's a new day. I hope all that happened yesterday was just some horrible nightmare vision brought about by a lack of sleep.

Monsters aren't real, right? Even if they are, they can't get you on a sunny day, right?

As I look up to see if the weather is going to get cloudy, I glimpse a horrible, maddening sight.

There are eight arachnid legs scurrying back into hiding after I catch a glance of them covertly sticking out from behind the sun.

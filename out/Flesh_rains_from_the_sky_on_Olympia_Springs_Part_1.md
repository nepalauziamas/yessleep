Meat rains from the sky approximately three times a month in my hometown. Only in the town boundaries. No further. Most of us have no damn clue where it comes from. The mayor does though. Probably the old man who runs the church where we dispose of it. Creepy bastards, the both of them.

Sounds like a load of horseshit, huh? Sure, I get it. It’s one of those hokey urban legends that gets passed down over the years. It was probably some normal thing and then Joe Blow told a slightly different version of it. Then it passed down from generation to generation with just a few changes here and there until the story lost its roots.

Not this one. The story from the first time it happened is exactly how it is told now. Dug up an old article online about it from some defunct newspaper out of Louisville.

I’m not going to print it here word for word. Probably plagiarism or something. I’ll just give you my abbreviated version.

On March 3, 1876, it rained chunks of meat in Olympia Springs, Kentucky for a little less than five minutes. The witness considered to be the most reliable was a woman identified only as Mrs. Crouch. She reported sitting on her porch making soap just before noon when the meat began to fall onto her front yard.

Fearing it to be a sign from God, she waited for the deluge of flesh to stop before traveling to her neighbors to see if it had affected the entire area. As she walked she could see that the shreds of meat had fallen over all of Olympia Springs. Her neighbors wandered through their yard gazing in fear and wonder at the pieces of viscera and muscle covering the town.

A handful of citizens cooked and ate the meat in an attempt to identify it. Opinions ranged from beef, deer, lamb, and bear. Without being able to reach a consensus someone from the town eventually sent a piece of the meat to the Newark Scientific Association. After examination, the association determined the origin of the meat to be one of two things.

The first possibility was lung tissue from a horse.

The second possibility was lung tissue from a human infant.

The source and variety of the meat were never officially determined and the strange event faded into obscurity. Some theories range from a flock of vultures simultaneously vomiting the meat on the town or an odd collection of bacteria forming and falling from the skies resembling chunks of flesh.

The article makes it sound like it happened once. Nah, that garbage still pours from the sky at irregular intervals to this day.

My job is to clean it up.

The town isn’t big but there are twenty-one of us on the payroll. We all make a little north of $60,000 a year which is a jackpot in a rural area like this. They call us the city work crew. Everyone in town knows we’re the guys that clean up that god-forsaken mess. We’re kind of urban legends ourselves. No one else in town is allowed out while the meat falls except us. We start cleaning minutes after it starts falling.

It used to seem like a pretty cushy gig until recent events. You are only scheduled to work one eight-hour shift each week. The only duty during your shift is to sit on the back stoop of the town hall annex and watch the skies for signs of the falling meat.

When the disgusting downpour gets going it’s all hands on deck. All twenty-one of us report for cleanup duty immediately.

It doesn’t fall on a set schedule. Like I said, about three times a month. Could be day or night. Sometimes it would dump down four or five times a month.

If it starts on your shift there is a paint-chipped red button, Old Red, fixed to the brick wall of the annex. As soon as the meat starts to fall you punch it. Sirens that take your mind to World War 2 air raid warnings burst across the town. When the siren is on, every citizen in town knows to head indoors immediately, no questions asked.

If you’re taking a stroll through a neighborhood far from home when the alarm sounds, you walk to the first available home, knock on the door, and the owner is going to let you inside. Been that way since I was a kid. Longer than that I’m sure.

Then you shut the blinds and stay inside until the siren cuts off. We handle that too. After our crew scours the town looking for the pulpy shreds and takes them to the church we hit that good old red button again and the wailing ceases. You’re free to head outside until we sound the alarm again.

While we’re on cleanup duty we have to wear the most uncomfortable getup I’ve ever had the displeasure of putting on. Rubber fishing waders with attached boots. Knee-length raincoat. Fisherman’s hat. Goggles and a respirator. It’s like your own personal sauna with no off switch.

We haul around wheelbarrows and use trash picker sticks to collect the fleshy bits across the town. It feels like you’re making a demonic kabob when you’ve gathered up a dozen chunks of the shit. Once your trash spike is covered in the slimy mess, you press them off into the wheelbarrow.

After a thorough sweep of the town, we haul the greasy tubs to the back of Olympia Springs Primitive Church. Reverend Packard’ll be standing out back next to the old coal chute and watching as we dump all twenty-one loads of meat into the inky darkness. Packard hasn’t ever done anything bad that I’ve seen but the guy has always given me a chill that ran into my bones.

For the longest time what he does with the meat was a mystery to us. He told us there was an old furnace down there that he uses to burn up. That explanation never sat well with me. When we rolled the wheelbarrows up and he opened the chute the pissy smell of ammonia and tang of coppery blood mixed with rot would hit you like a sack of bricks.

Smelled like he was just storing the stuff down there.

I had done the job for over fifteen years with no complaints. My time was largely my own and the fellas I worked with were good company. Everything was smooth sailing until Thomas Jordan on our crew screwed the pooch and swallowed some of that ungodly shit.

The day it happened I was on watch behind the annex. Thumbing through an old paperback ate up most of my days on duty. My eyes were getting heavy and I was about to drift off into a midafternoon nap when I heard a wet *plop* on the metal roof above me.

A red piece of gristle slid down onto the concrete in front of me and I reached over my shoulder and slapped Old Red. As the sirens lazily blasted into life I tossed the paperback into the chair and headed inside to gear up. My walkie chattered as the other crewmen signaled their acknowledgment.

Within two minutes of the siren, all twenty-one men on the crew signaled they were in action and collecting the falling meat. I had looked at the sky that day and could see the characteristic scarlet hue that appeared when the rain started. It never overpowered the blue of the sky but the sickening shade always made itself known.

The deluge lasted longer than usual that day. Seven minutes since the start and fat globs of flesh were still pelting off of my gear and onto the ground. It was never an overwhelming amount but longer periods of downfall equaled a longer clean up and it had taken two wheelbarrow loads for a few of the men.

“Ahoy there, Jacob!” Reverend Packard shouted as I rolled my solitary load toward the coal chute. He wore the same gear as the cleanup crew. The downpour of muscle and tissue had stopped long ago and all of the grizzly leavings had been collected. “Hard day?”

I just nodded at the old man in response. His televangelist grin and perky demeanor during these days had always put me on edge. Packard was the only person in town to find any joy in these events.

The front tire of my wheelbarrow bumped against the edge of the chute as I dumped the slick load of flesh into the blackness below. Sickening splatters echoed up from the church basement accompanied by the aroma of piss and blood. My stomach churned as it always had but luckily I managed to keep my lunch down.

“The rain lasted longer than usual today,” Packard said with glee. “Wonder what that’s about!”

“Kinda weird to me that you only wonder why it laster longer instead of why this shit happens at all.” I snorted as I began to walk away.

“You ought to be grateful,” he called at me as I made my way back toward the annex. “Keeps you employed and keeps the town safe!”

I paused and turned around to look at the gleeful preacher.

“The hell do you mean it keeps us safe?” I asked. “You know what this is?”

The smile melted away from Packard’s face. His brows furrowed and he looked up toward the now clear blue sky. His arms stretched out, palms turned upward. That devious smile slid back across his lips.

“No,” he muttered. “Just a labor God set before us. We gather the downfall as the Israelites gathered manna in the desert.”

“The Israelites ate the manna,” I said with a sneer. “We burn this shit.”

No reply. Packard just kept his arms outstretched and looked into the sky.

Later that night as I sat in my recliner working away at my fourth beer when my cellphone rang. Looking at the screen I saw Thomas’s face smiling stupidly at me. I slid my thumb across the screen to answer and put the phone to my ear.

“Didn’t see you today, Tom,” I said without a greeting.

“I left pretty quick after I dropped off my collection,” he responded. “Not feelin’ too well if I’m honest.”

“What’s got you under the weather?” I ask as I sat my beer down on the table and dropped the leg rest on the recliner. “Stomach bug?”

The line remained silent.

“Tom?” I questioned. “You there, bud?”

“Yeah,” he finally responded. “Got some of that meat in my mouth today. My stomach’s been in knots ever since.”

I scrunched my brow in confusion. He had gotten some of that garbage in his mouth?

“Were you wearin’ your gear?” I asked.

Silence again.

“Tom, were you wearing your fucking mask?” I barked. “Don’t tell me you took it off!”

“It was hot, Jacob,” he muttered weakly. I heard him pull the phone away from his face and the sound of vomit splashing in the toilet filled the silence. “I just pulled down my respirator for a second to catch my breath and a piece of it fell in my mouth. I spit it out but I’m sure I swallowed some of the blood on it.”

“You dressed?” I asked as I jumped from the recliner and started pulling on my boots. “I’m comin’ to take you to see the doc.”

“Yeah,” he said hoarsely. “Thanks, Jake.”

There wasn’t much traffic in that sleepy town so I blew through stop signs and the two traffic signals without care. Most of us had been doing the clean-up job for years but Thomas was just a kid. We’d warned him not to take a chance with this stuff but sometimes kids just don’t listen.

Less than twenty minutes after hanging up the phone I had parked my truck haphazardly in Thomas’ driveway and bounded to the porch. I pounded against the door and called his name for what felt like an hour but received no response. Pressing my ear against the door I could hear a faint voice but couldn’t make out the words.

My panic had risen to a point I couldn’t handle. I began to kick the door which started to splinter but stayed firmly in place. Realizing I was making no real progress I started to slam my shoulder into the splintering wood. With a final crunch and snap the door flew inward and I saw Thomas sprawled on the floor.

Or what I thought was Thomas.

He had always been a beanpole of a kid but not anymore.

The same wretched smell from the church coal chute filled my nose as I walked toward the fleshy pile on the center of the living room rug. An almost human-like figure squirmed lazily in place. Folds of fatty flesh spilled out from a shirt and jeans that were bursting at the seams. Fingers and toes swollen like cooked sausage protruded from bloated stubs that were once his arms and legs.

Blood and pile pooled around the pulsing mass of flesh.

“Tom?” I muttered with a weak voice.

“Jathawb?” the thing replied with a wet, wheezing effort.

Saliva bubbled from a fatty fold where his face should have been. The repulsive appendages twitched as the mound of flesh attempted to orient itself toward me. Its efforts were worthless and a blubbering cry poured from the folds.

Feeling sick to my stomach I ran outside and vomited off the edge of the porch. After wiping away the wet flecks from my face I pulled my phone out of my pocket and dialed 911. When the operator answered I rambled incoherently about Thomas and his grotesque condition. Eventually, the operator settled for the address and told me that an EMT crew would be on their way immediately.

I paced the driveway while I waited. Thomas needed help but I knew there wasn’t a damn thing I could do for him. Looking at him made me feel like I was losing my mind. I knew that thing in there had to be Thomas but nothing from the darkest part of my mind could understand how swallowing any of that hellish meat could have done this to him.

When the EMTs arrived I watched helplessly from the driveway. The two men struggled to try and slide Thomas onto the gurney but his incredible mass was too much for them. One of the men called for a second EMT unit who arrived shortly after.

The combined effort of four mean and two gurneys was enough to haul him out of the house and load him into the back of the ambulance. A trail of blood and bile trickled down behind them as they carried him out. The second EMT team closed up the ambulance and slapped the back door before the sirens boomed into life. Gravel flew into the air as they peeled away from the house.

“Where are they takin’ him?” I asked one of the EMTs.

“County General,” one responded.

“I’ll meet you there,” I barked and started running toward my truck.

“No,” he responded. “Mayor says for you to go home. Could be another rain.”

I froze in my tracks.

“What the hell do you mean the mayor told me to go home?”

“Any illness on the city clean-up crew is reported to the mayor,” the man said sternly. “Can’t have two of you out of rotation. If it happens again while two of you are out it could cause issues.”

“It already fucking fell today!” I shouted at the man. “I am forty-eight fucking years old and never once in my entire life has that shit happened twice in a day!”

“Go home, Jake,” he said as he got into his ambulance. “You can’t do anything for him.” He slammed the door and the ambulance drove out of sight.

Frustrated and scared I got in my truck to head home. I didn’t want to leave Thomas alone at the hospital but I knew the paramedic was right. What the hell could I have done for him? I couldn’t even keep it together enough to stay in the room with him I waited for help to arrive.

Rather than take the direct route home I decided to drive aimlessly for a bit to clear my head. Cigarette butts were overflowing from the console ashtray by the time I decided to finally call it a night. Tired and confused I started heading toward the house.

Olympia Springs Primitive Church sat ahead of me on my way and I could see the outline of a large vehicle sitting at the rear. As I cruised closer I could see it was the ambulance that had carried Tom away. The four EMTs were hauling something large covered in a white sheet out and carrying it toward the back of the church. Packard was standing beside the chute holding the cover open.

The men slid the sheet-covered gurneys into the chute.

I drove past the church and pulled off behind a storage rental unit. My heart was in my throat and I could feel my pulse in my ears. Those bastards hadn’t taken Thomas to the hospital. They tossed him like garbage into that piss and blood-smelling hellhole.

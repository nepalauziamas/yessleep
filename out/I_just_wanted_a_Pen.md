When I was kid, somehow I always end up without a pen. I get scolded if I tell my parents. 

One of my teachers offered me to buy me a pen. He was such a nice person and he always takes time to explain studies with patience. In return he asked me to deliver a letter to his girlfriend in his absence. He said the letter would come to school on my name, I just need to take that letter few blocks where his girlfriend lives.

Few days later I received the letter and Im on my way to deliver that letter. My neighbour got suspicious and  asked me what is that I'm carrying, I said it's nothing. So he forcefully grabbed it from me, took it to my parents. They called few other people in the neighborhood, they all went to school principal asked him what is he doing while these kind of things are going on. Then they went to girl's house created a huge scene, her parents started beating the shit out of her infront of everyone. Then the next day they scolded the teacher , then they got him fired. 
I even heard few people had an eye for the girl and they are mad that the girl likes the other guy. They were so much happy that they get to do this them.

Now my friends started alienating me because I got their favourite teacher got fired. 

I got real mad at these people.
I finally shouted is anyone going to buy me the pen? Some laughed and some started told my parents to buy me the pen. They just ignored me for my pleas for that pen next couple of days.

They created so much drama throughout the day, but none of them bought me a pen. 

WHERE THE FUCK IS MY PEN

You see the thing about people, they just want someone to blame, they just want to fuck someone one way or other way. Someone else would have fucked them, so they are trying to fuck you for it. They know it and everyone know it. The letter was just a reason for them. None of them give a fuck about me .

I grew old without ever seeing an exception.

This kind of behaviour is seen throughout the country in the modern times. It's called Mob mentality , they gather up in mobs and try to attack people, in the name of justice or a cause. This behaviour is somehow accepted by the society. In my opinion these people are the most dangerous people on the planet. They are fueled by rage , anger , jealous, frustrations , life is pretty much fucked up to them. It's like a open secret to most of them. 
They don't want to solve the problem, they don't care about the laws.Even If they managed to kill that poor teacher they would have gone home without a regret. I think the government's around the world should tighten the mob mentality laws. Increase the punishment for those who participated in mob attacks for whatever the cause it is.

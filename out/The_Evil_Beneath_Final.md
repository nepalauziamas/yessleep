Maurice Chevalier awaited me to do his bidding. To kill those who’d killed my brother, to satisfy the hunger of him and his family, and to become the caretaker of darkness. It was the last thing I wanted to do. The last thing I wanted to be.

“Let me say goodbye to my brother first.”

Maurice eyed me for a moment without speaking, then stepped aside. Josh was cold and lifeless when I embraced him for the last time. I leaned to his ear and whispered my final goodbye and then discreetly removed a lighter from his coat pocket.

“I’ll get you Eloise and Charles,” I told Maurice.

“And then?”

“Then, more.”

Maurice smirked ever so slightly, then held out his hand for me to leave the mausoleum and continue forth with the task. The horde of bloodthirsty vampires watched with disappointment as a potential meal was permitted to leave. Their breath was cold against my neck as I made my way through and back to the dark tunnel, which I followed to the pit in which the wire remained hanging from the conduit above. Entries to different tunnels surrounded the hole—other families at the ends of each. 

I gripped the thin-gauge wire and tugged at it. I’m not heavy, per se, but the likelihood of either the wire or the conduit it was tied to holding my weight, was slim. But, I had no other option. 

The wire stretched as my feet lifted from the dirt and the conduit creaked, the screws beginning to separate from the old wooden joists. I struggled to grip the thin wire and was forced to have to wrap it around my hands and pull, then unwrap them long enough to reach up and grab more. Thankfully, I did not have far to climb and managed to grab ahold of the edge and heave myself into the crawlspace.

I had to get above, find Eloise and Charles, and kill them. I had to do it not for the vampires but for Josh. 

For my thirst for revenge. 

For justice. 

I pulled the wire cutters from my pocket and began chipping away at one of the joists. The aged wood broke away easily, and I was able to carry a cluster of hand-sized pieces over to the small hole that we had drilled into the floor earlier that day. I set the pile of wood shards on the ground beneath the small hole, then hurried around the crawlspace, searching, and ultimately finding next to the door some loose dead grass. With the grass in hand, I crawled back to the pile of wood, set the grass on top, and took Josh’s lighter out of my pocket.

The fire was not significant at first, but a large fire was not my goal. I wanted the smoke. I wanted it to float through the hole and into the house, to catch the attention of Charles and Eloise and to force them into action. For all they knew, this fire was going to grow, and if left alone, would burn down the whole damn house. 

I watched as the fire got larger and the smoke with it, filling the crawlspace in the process. With my shirt held over my nose and mouth, I waited as the smoke slithered through the hole and into the house. Before long, there was a rapid shuffle of feet overhead and the much anticipated, anxious voice of Charles, asking, “what’s going on down there?”

I crawled over and answered, “well, there’s a fire, Charles. Can’t you see the smoke?”

“Put it out, dammit!”

I couldn’t help but chuckle. “No, I think I’ll just let it burn.”

There was a thunderous crack and a splintering of wood to my left that caught me off guard. A second ray of light shined down from a second hole overhead. Then another crack and another hole. Again and again, as I scrambled along the dirt, trying to avoid one shot after another until finally, the gun clicked empty.

“Put that fire out!” Eloise hollered. 

Six rays of light shone down into the crawlspace from various locations.

I took in the scene as I gathered my breath and quipped, “thanks for the extra holes. That’ll help smoke the place out more quickly.”

Eloise grunted and ordered Charles to “cover the holes.”

“What about the fire?” He asked.

“Go put it out after.”

“Miss Eloise–”

“You heard me!”

There was a pause, and then Charles answered, “yes, ma’am.” He then walked to another side of the house, grabbed a large area rug, and covered each hole. 

I scrambled over to the door and waited as the crawlspace, no longer ventilated, began to fill with smoke from the fire, which had grown larger than I’d anticipated—the flames licking the wood overhead. As I sat there with wire cutters in hand, shirt covering my nose and mouth, my eyes began to sting from the smoke, and before too long, I began to cough. If Charles did not hurry, I would be forced to put the fire out myself or risk passing out from smoke inhalation.

There came a crunch of leaves outside the door, followed by the sound of Charles grunting as he knelt. I hid off to the side and watched as the door unlocked, then swung open. 

Slowly, the barrel of a revolver peeked through the doorway, then the hand that held it. I quickly gripped Charles’ wrist and yanked him into the crawlspace, and he reflexively fired a single shot that exploded into the brick wall on the opposite side. He fell face-first into the dirt, and I immediately knocked the revolver from his grip. Charles rolled onto his back, and there was a sudden glint of silver as he drove a blade between my ribs. I had not seen the knife until it was too late. Adrenaline, however, deemed it meaningless. 

Charles’ eyes widened with fear as I stabbed the wire cutters into one of them. He roared in pain and removed the blade from my ribs, I removed the wire cutters from his eye, and at the same time, we reintroduced them to each other–his knife to my ribs, my wire cutters to his neck. Charles yelped, and his hand shot to his neck. Almost immediately, he had gone weak. Through his one good eye, Charles looked up at me through the escaping smoke and gurgled his final words.

“It was necessary what we did.”

I pushed off of him, grabbed the revolver, and stumbled out the doorway as Charles took his last breath; then, I closed the door.

The knife was still sticking between my ribs–each breath sharp and painful. A punctured lung soon to collapse. I knelt, clenched my jaw, and removed the blade, feeling an abrupt fire in my lung and the preceding wetness as blood cascaded down my side. I unzipped the jumpsuit I’d been wearing since before entering the crawlspace, took it off, then proceeded to cut away the legs with the knife. I placed them over my wounds and tied them around my torso to slow the bleeding. 

Holding pressure with my right hand, I made my way to the front of the house and stepped inside Chevalier Manor. Six rounds in the revolver and a bloodied knife in my pocket. The house was dark; Eloise must’ve turned out the lights–maybe even shut off the power. I began to worry that she’d escaped through some hidden passageway or had secured herself into a panic room I was unaware of, or, perhaps, she wasn’t inside the house at all. But, those worries came to rest as I began to ascend the stairs, and saw leaning on her cane at the top, another revolver in hand, Eloise.

“You have no idea–”

Tired and injured and impatient with rage, I had no interest in what Eloise had to say. I immediately shot a round into her abdomen. The shot knocked the fragile old hag backward, and the cane and gun fell from her hands. I limped to the top, where she lay moaning on the floor, and grabbed her by the ankles.

“Stop!” She barked.

With a forceful yank, I pulled her down the stairs, her snood coming loose as her head bounced off each hard, wooden step. By the time we reached the bottom, she was unconscious and bleeding. Possibly dead. But, I had one last thing to do. I dragged her across the floor and over to the hatch, opened it, and just like had been done to my brother, kicked her bleeding body inside, and listened as her bones snapped from the long fall to the hellish pit below.

The vampires were already waiting at the bottom, eyeing me from beneath a cloud of smoke, hissing with frustration. Behind me, near the stairs, flames had burnt through and were beginning to spread. 

I never planned to help the vampires. To feed them or be their caretaker. I failed to see how Maurice could make me, with him being trapped inside the catacombs. The upper hand was mine, and it was high time someone put an end to that subterranean nightmare.

Every explosive thing I could find, I dropped into the pit. I rained gasoline onto the vampires as they fed on Eloise, then dropped propane tanks I found out back. Herbicides. Pesticides. Everything that I could find that I felt would blow them all to hell.

Then I stepped outside and watched the house burn.

It was spreading, flames flicking from the windows. Black smoke billowing out into the evening. It wasn’t until nightfall that I heard the coming sirens. My truck had been moved, presumably by Charles, at some point while I’d been trapped inside the crawlspace, so I limped past the burning house and far into the vast acreage of Chevalier land, where I anxiously watched the fire department arrive to fight the blaze. They hurried their engines down the long driveway. The arsenal of explosives had yet to detonate. I needed to warn them, but doing so could spawn questions, or even worse, I could get caught up in the explosion as well.

But I couldn’t let them die. 

I braced my side and began running towards the house. “Stop!” I yelled, waving frantically. Nobody could see me. The flames were their only focus. I ran faster, my lung aching with each labored breath. “Stop!”

Suddenly, the ground shook, and the house and the earth around it exploded into a fiery eruption of wood, brick, bone, and dirt. I stumbled to a halt and stared at the raging fire. Through the flickering, I caught a glimpse of the fire engines and firefighters, neither of which appeared harmed. Relief flooded over me, and I fell to my knees.

“Wouldn’t it have been a pity if they’d died?”

The deep voice startled me. 

*Maurice.* 

“You’re alive?” I gasped.

“We all are.” Maurice turned, and in the dark behind him, I could see the glowing snake-like eyes of the other vampires. He turned back and took a step towards me.

“But how?”

“Do you think that after all those years underground, I did not find another way out?”

I stumbled a step back. “Then why didn’t you leave sooner?”

“Because we cannot be trusted on the surface, Eric. Not with all this….” Maurice ran a long fingernail down the side of my cheek, “...accessible nourishment.”

Maurice narrowed his eyes and smirked as I pushed his hand away. 

“Until now, I was the only one who knew there was another way out,” he continued. “As long as they were fed, I did not have to worry about their cravings getting out of hand.” Maurice turned to look at the others, then turned back to me and said, “I cannot control them out here.”

I did not respond. Maurice looked past me at the fire, the flames glimmering off the whites of his eyes. His gaze lingered on me once more, then Maurice turned and walked back towards the others.

“What now?” I asked.

Without stopping, Maurice answered, “we feed.”

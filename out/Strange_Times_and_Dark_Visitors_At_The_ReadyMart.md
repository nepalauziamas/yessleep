I had nearly missed the call over the blare of music in my headphones, as I stocked the milk in the freezer section.

My mind had been split between trying to stay warm under the artificial cold of the freezer, and the song I had blaring through my headphone, when I heard it from the ear I'd left free.

"*David and Matthew to the register, I need David and Matthew at the register.*"  My coworker’s voice hissed over the ancient PA system blared through an ear-splitting electronic squeal and a cloud of audio snow.

I slid my phone out of my pocket, checking the time.

*1:23 A.M*. I had four more hours on shift.

The store was usually empty by now. The busiest hours always came hours before or after I was on shift.

Having little to no customers during most of my hours there, I occupied my time by stocking the things emptied over the day.

Which was why it struck me as *odd* that I was being called to the register.

I could have never imagined what was really waiting for me up there.

I doubted there was some overflow of waiting shoppers building up at Chelsea's register, and I'd told her only minutes prior that I'd be stocking the perishables.

Usually, if someone needed me this late, they'd just walk over and ask.

I considered whether or not to finish the task at hand, unsure of whether or not it was best to leave the milk outside of the freezer for what was an undetermined amount of time when I heard the click of approaching footsteps on the linoleum.

Chelsea appeared from down one of the aisles, moving at such a brisk pace I almost immediately knew something was up.

I nodded her way, opening my mouth to ask whether whatever she needed at the register could wait until the milk was away.

Yet when I saw the look on her face, the words seemed to get stuck in my throat.

She was oddly pale, with a look as though she’d just walked in on her own funeral, eyes wide and watery. And she was *shaking* like a leaf, with such force I worried for her balance.

She stared at me with a thousand-mile stare, as if she'd just seen a ghost.

She moved so quickly, and got so close to me I nearly backed into the freezer in surprise when she brought her mouth to my ear and whispered,

"There's someone at the register,"

Her voice unsteady and strained with emotion.

"He won't leave, and there's something *very* wrong about him."

When she pulled away, I could see the gleam of… I don't know terror, I suppose, in her eyes - that resolve wavering as a look that was a wide eyed mix of unease and panic passed across her face.

My mind spun at the unusual state of her. Chelsea was as cool-headed as they come.

Having moved to our small town from New York, Matt and I had always joked that she was built tougher than the rest of us, and whenever there was an unruly customer to deal with, man or woman, she never failed to handle it.

A foreboding chill rippled down my spine, not from the freezer for once, sending a spasm through me as I considered the customer who could bring Chelsea to tears.

"Is he - does he have a gun?"

She shook her head, wiping her eyes and sniffing.

"N - no, he just, he's just standing there looking at me. And he won't speak or leave and he keeps making this… *sound*\-"

“Where’s Matt?” I asked.

Matt was our co-worker, and the third on the late shift with us.

He and Chelsea had been dating for a few months, and started working at the Ready-Mart as a way to save up for an apartment.

He was a funny, cool-headed sort, who perpetually avoided conflict where it came, a perfect yin to her yang.

He tended to bounce around the store, like me, doing a bit of whatever needed doing, though he had a habit for extra long smoke breaks multiple times a shift.

“He said he was taking trash out back, you were the first person I found.”

It was at that point that I caught something from the corner of my eye at the far end of the nearest aisle, close to the registers.

From out of my periphery for a moment, I saw someone was leaning past the shelf in a way that hardly made sense balance-wise, concealing all but their upper half, watching us tactlessly.

Naturally, my eyes followed, and as I turned my head a bit to peer past Chelsea down the aisle from which she'd just arrived, I caught a glimpse of what looked to be a man peering behind the farthest shelf.

As soon as my eyes turned to meet him, he disappeared with an almost cartoonish fervor, ducking out of sight with a jarring quickness.

Pins and needles shot along my skin as I stared down the empty hallway.

Chelsea followed my gaze, eyes somehow widening further as she spun around to look where I was looking.

I felt my heartbeat quicken. Everything about Chelsea's reaction and the odd, though brief glimpse of the man at the end of the aisle was making me feel like at the very least, we may be dealing with someone a little…*off*.

Still, I saw little other option than to try and see what he wanted or ask him to leave.

As distressed as Chelsea already was, I knew I had to do something to avoid a scene, but didn't want to guarantee an escalation of things.

I started down the aisle towards the register.

I heard Chelsea gasp, and almost immediately her hand was wrapped around my wrist drawing me back.

"Don't. He's… he's not right."

Her eyes watered, but she didn't waver, a look of panicked determination emblazoned on her features as she looked into my eyes.

"If he's being a weirdo, I'll ask him to leave. If he won't, I'll call the cops," I assured, carefully pulling my arm free.

“You can stay here, or head to the back and get some space if you want."

She stared at me for several moments, chewing her lip as she seemed to consider things, before wiping at her eyes with the backs of her hand.

"No, I'll go with you. If he gets…weird again I'll call the cops."

I grimaced slightly, despite myself.

It wasn't that I didn't trust her to do as she said, but I'd never seen her in such a state before and worried what might happen if she continued to be around whoever it was upfront.

Still, I didn't feel we had the time for an argument, and the look in her eye told me it would take one at the very least to dissuade her so we made our way down the aisle.

It's strange, I'd walked that same aisle probably hundreds of times this month, never once feeling anything at all - but watching the palpable increase in Chelsea's tension as we neared the registers made my stomach sink lower with each step.

Suddenly the bright lights and tan floors of the store began to feel like that of a hospital, and anxiety ebbed and surged through me as though we were walking toward the doctor for bad news.

As we reached the end of the aisle, I immediately noted the strange sound growing with our approach.

It was a persistent clicking, reminiscent at first of the clank of a bicycle's gears when you take your feet off the pedals.

Chelsea stopped, terror managing to surpass her defenses as she froze just as we approached the registers.

She shook her head vigorously, pressing her hands to her ears half-heartedly.

The look on my face was likely as quizzical as I felt, and she offered an explanation.

"I'm staying here. I - I don't like how he looks at me. I'll watch from right here."

I was unnerved, but felt no need to argue, her discomfort obvious. It was unlike her to say the least.

Having worked with Chelsea and her boyfriend Matt over the past few months, I’d come to develop a sort of casual friendship with the two, with them even being the only co-workers I’d actually hung out with outside of work on occasion.

In that time, I’d known Chelsea to be the type who reveled in the opportunity to put an out-of-line customer in their place - much to Matthew’s constant chagrin.

To see her like this was more than a little alarming.

The odd click grew louder as I walked out of the aisle.

As the line of registers came into view, so did he. In an instant, I was aware of two things; the first was that clicking was coming from him - almost certainly the sound that Chelsea had spoken of.

The second was the *smell*. It was thick and sour, a stench that seemed to permeate the air as I approached, stirring an old memory.

I live down the road from a farm that has a couple of goats notorious for escape. My brothers and I would always delight in finding one roaming our property and making a game of chasing it back home.

One summer, when I was a kid, our neighbors had told us one of the goats, a three-year-old with a habit for late-night break-outs, hadn't been seen in an unusual amount of time.

Around the same time, from the woods near our house, we began to smell an overwhelming stench carried by the breeze that plagued us for a couple of days, got so bad we wouldn’t even play outside. A horrible smell like old meat left in the sun.

My oldest brother found the animal's carcass not far past the tree line a few days later. Dad suspected a mountain lion had gotten ahold of it.

Whatever the case, I never forgot that smell.

The reek of *decay* now, or some reason, wafting through our convenience store.

The chill I felt as I approached made me certain someone somewhere was practically tap dancing over my grave.

The man at the register wore a tattered flannel and a pair of dirty jeans that look to have been worn for months on end without a wash.

He stood with his back to me, but I could see that he was swaying - his body rocking from side to side as though he were struggling to maintain his balance. Despite the black hood he wore, I could see that his head was cocked at an odd angle to the right.

"How ya doin’ sir?" I called using my customer service voice as I crossed the gulf between the register and aisle.

"Can I help you?"

I rounded the opposite end of the nearest shelf, offering cheap Easter-themed candies, keeping a distance between the man and myself as I approached.

I felt that day's lunch churn about in my gut, as the heavy odor of rot and mildew - damp and overpowering - began to grow unbearable on approach, its source without question.

*Click.click.click.*

That sound *again*, it reminded me vaguely of the strange chittering my cat had made the one time it escaped the house to chase a bird.

Though his hoodie was up, obscuring his face, I was certain he’d made the sound with his mouth, though *how -* I wasn’t so sure.

It sent my gut twisting like a mound of worms, somehow even more disturbing up close. As I rounded the register, I got my first view of the man from the front.

*Jesus fucking Christ.*

It was a testament to my self-control that I managed to limit the outburst to just a thought.

He looked like walking death. His face was a sort of paper-thin and pale I’d thought reserved for the dead or dying, yet it appeared almost…plastic - shiny and hollow - in a way that made my skin crawl.

It was…mask-like, and I couldn’t peg why, but it just seemed as though his face didn’t fit.

Something dark red ran down his mouth and chin, and it didn’t take much for me to guess what it was . The ragged condition of his lips telling me he’d chewed them near into oblivion.

Which only made those eyes all the more jarring.

They were bloodshot, almost all of the white replaced by a pale red, and his iris’ were two twin pools of obsidian, boring through my skull with a glassy, yet sinister stare.

I shuddered out of mutual disquiet and disgust…

He glared at me with those scarlet eyes, as though he were trying to peer into my thoughts.

For a moment, I found my words escaping me, a strange, primal sort of fear surging through me under that gaze that felt so entirely inhuman.

My heartbeat with a painful thrum, so loud I could almost hear it, as my throat seemed to go dry, making me stumble over my words.

"Ca - Can I, uh, help you?"

My words seem to hang in the air for several long, tense seconds that seemed to grow heavier with each passing moment.

Slowly, his head cocked to the side, in an almost reptilian gesture.

His eyes never once wavered from my own.

God, that face…it made me want to scream, or attack him, or run out of the store and never look back. No amount of staring back at him made his horrific visage any more palatable, that sickly pale skin far too unnatural.

“Cuh - cuh - cuh,” the sound was coming from his mouth, yet his lips never once moved until the corners wavered, his smile stretching almost imperceptibly.

It sounded like he was just making the ‘k’ sound repeatedly, like a broken record. It wasn’t like a stutter, more as if he were trying to figure out how his mouth worked, repeating the sound while staring back at me.

“Cuh - cuh - cuh,”

The idea that this may some sort of mental health or drug-related incident was beginning to seem like a sure bet

“Sir, I -”

“*Can I help you*?”

The cold shiver that sent down my spine made my entire body twitch, and as the man finally spoke, I felt dread begin to seep through my consciousness.

He sounded like *me*. I’ve heard impressions before, hell, I’ve got a few of my own I’m known to whip out at parties.

THIS was not that. He literally spoke my own words back to me, as if it were a recording.

Until that moment, I was certain that as odd as things had been, the man before me was just that.

For the first time, it began to occur to me that that may not be the case.

“Can I help you?” He repeated it, and again it was as if I had a delayed echo.

“Welcome to Ready-Mart!” he chirped, now in Chelsea’s voice.

“Make him stop, make him STOP!” Chelsea screamed from where she stood, clamping her hands over her ears, tears running down her face.

I couldn’t blame her for her reaction. At that moment I had been struggling to come to grips with what was going on, some small part of me still praying I’d fallen asleep on shift again and this was some horrifically vivid nightmare.

The man…thing, whatever it was, smiled at that. The first decipherable gesture he had made since entering.

His head snapped around, almost a complete 180, turning to face Chelsea though his body never once wavered, still facing me.

His jaw dropped so low and with such suddenness, I was sure it must have ripped free from the bone.

“Stop! Stop looking at me like that stop -”

When he spoke next, a cold splash of realization hit me, and by the look on her face, Chelsea as well.

“Stop! Stop, leave me the fuck alone! HEL-”

The uncanny recreation of Matthew’s voice ended abruptly. Somehow, that seemed worse than if it had continued.

The look on Chelsea’s face was unlike anything I’d ever seen outside of a movie. It was a strange blend of life-altering sadness, horror, and unmitigated fury all at once.

“It - it has Matthew’s voice -”

Her voice shook as she spoke, every emotion on her face present in her words.

“How does it have Matthew’s voice?”

So far, it had only been able to mimic us after hearing us, and now, it had just used Matthew’s voice. The implication hung overhead like a guillotine. The fact that he still hadn’t responded to the PA or come back from his garbage run only added fuel to the fire.

I did my level best to speak my next words as calmly as I could manage, which wasn’t much given the state of things.

“Chelsea,” my voice wavered as I spoke.

“Go find Matt, and call the police.”

Chelsea nodded, but before she could take a step to leave, the thing made a…a *sound*. It was unlike anything I have ever heard from a living thing before.

The closest things I can compare it to are the noise a car brake makes before an accident or the shriek of some winged dinosaur in a movie.

It was long and piercing, the sort of noise that I could feel shaking my eardrums and bones alike, and utterly unlike anything produced by human vocal cords. Chelsea doubled over, clutching her ears.

I did the same but it was too late, the pain in my head worse than any migraine I’d ever had.

I felt a sharp pop in my left ear, followed by a tinnitus-like ringing and an odd wet trickle along that side of my jaw.

The man or whatever this thing was, extended an arm pointing one abnormally long finger in Chelsea’s direction much to her utter horror. His mouth extended lower, and lower, and lower until its lower jaw hung past its collarbone as that god awful screeching continued.

The lights flickered, once, then twice, then a final third time. His ungodly wail came to an end.

For a moment, there was nothing but an awful silence, broken only by the continued ringing in my ear and the flicker of the lights.

It was the sort of quiet that falls right before a tornado, when everything adopts an unnatural stillness, and the air is charged with a foreboding energy.

I made eye contact with Chelsea, and I could see that we were both feeling it too.

She was gone in an instant, darting off down the aisle towards the back of the store. She must have gotten a few feet or so, when that...thing let out another of its horrid cries.

The lights flickered *off*, then *on*, then *off*…

The darkness remained, thick and suffocating.

My heart beat painfully as I strained to hear through the ringing, my sight now all but gone.

The first thing I heard was Chelsea cry out in surprise. The next, was a sudden clamor of footsteps moving forward.

*On.*

I could see again, and the first thing I noted was that the space before me was completely empty. He was gone.

“Run!” I cried, knowing it was neither necessary nor fruitful, but it seemed the only effort I could make knowing what was to come.

I darted to the register, grabbing the miniature bat Matt hsd stashed under it in case of emergencies, and broke out into a sprint towards the aisle Chelsea had gone down, knowing that was likely where it was too.

*Off.*

Darkness again. Whatever that thing had done to the power, it seemed would be a recurring issue.

My shoulder collided with one of the shelves in my blindness, wincing as the cold metal managed to cut into my arm through the sleeve of my shirt. Sharp pain radiated through it, but I kept running.

Somewhere in the darkness Chelsea's sudden scream rang out, immediately mixed with another strange cry from that thing.

*On*.

I could see again. My heart dropped. I was just in time to watch her face disappear, as she was dragged out of the aisle and out of sight.

For the brief second we made eye contact, the unbridled terror in her face like nothing I'd ever seen.

I ran as fast as I could, unwilling to squander the brief moments of vision, managing to reach the end of the aisle before -

*Off*.

Ironically, it occurred to me like a light bulb going off in an instant.

My phone! Between the nightmarish events and adrenaline of the night, it had somehow escaped my mind completely.

I fumbled through my pocket for the device, not even bothering to unlock it as I activated the flashlight.

I quickly began to dial 911.

The call sounded as though I were making it from a tunnel 600 feet under ground, the dispatcher's voice faint and choppy.

"Yeah, I'm calling from the Ready-Mart on North and Stony Creek, my coworker is being attacked, I think my other one may have been -"

I couldn't bring myself to say killed.

"Hurt. We need police immediately"

"Sir, - for - on- line."

Though the service at the store was never the greatest, I had never experienced this level of disruption and knew immediately it was a result of that thing.

I wasn't even fully sure she heard me, and while I knew protocol was to stay on the line, I couldn't afford to stay and talk while that creature had my friend.

I ended the call, and proceeded after the two. The back of the store was empty, the only thing visible near the other end of the was the rack of milk I’d been stocking. A growing pool of water puddled beneath it.

It occurred to me that I wasn't sure what this thing was capable of. I'd already seen and heard it do the impossible, and would surely risk a physical confrontation pursuing it.

Still, it wasn't like we ran a gun store, the selection of potential weapons was limited.

An idea occurred suddenly, tenuous at best, based on logic found in movies and YouTube videos.

I moved carefully, heart pounding in my ear, pointing the light down each of the aisles as I passed, stopping in a few to gather what I needed.

As I slid the can of cheap air spray into my pocket, already having what else I needed, a muffled cry echoed from somewhere in the store.

"Chelsea? Matt?" I called, proceeding again down the back of the store.

The sounds of a struggle from somewhere nearby made my ear perk up.

"Where are you motherfucker?!" I tried my best to project confidence, sounding more angry and afraid than anything.

From one of the aisles beside me, something shifted, and a low hiss carried through the dark. It sounded close…

"Chelsea?" I called.

I felt like a child walking from my room to the kitchen in the dark, the world around me suddenly full of unseen monsters.

There were only a few aisles left, Chelsea, and whatever it was that had her, were bound to be in one of the next three.

My stomach flipped at the realization, the suffocating feeling that I was slowly being closed in on beginning to take hold.

"*Hey*, David,"

My heart lurched painfully, and I nearly jumped out of my skin as I spun around.

I only realized it was Chelsea's voice after the initial shock settled, replaced by an immediate relief to not be faced down by some horrid nightmare creature.

"Jesus Christ, you scared the fuck outta me." I breathed.

As I aimed the light at the end of the aisle, it caught on her face, pale and almost reflective with what had to be sweat in the pitch black.

She was peering from around the end of the shelf, only her head visible, hair twisted and matted as it curtained either side of her face.

"Are you o-"

The rest of my words caught in the sudden dryness of my throat.

Her smile was wide, almost cartoonish and -

Almost as quickly as it came, the relief faded, replaced by a cold, heavy knot of dread.

Her *smile*…it..it wasn't *right*, neither the context or the appearance. It stretched just a bit too wide on her face, her eyes oddly…bloodshot? …

She - it lurched forward in an instant.

As if sensing that its charade was broken, giving off something like a hellish mix between a woman's wail and a canine's howl, *utterly* unnatural.

I didn't have a moment to spare, as it crossed the aisle with blinding speed, hands outstretched - ending in bestial claws.

I raised the aerosol can, sliding my phone into my pocket and gripping the lighter I always carried, flicking it as soon as it was out.

For those seconds, I was plunged into darkness, only the sounds of the approaching nightmare to greet me.

*Dear god, let this work.*

I pressed down on the button as I could feel the cold tips of its claws grazing my skin.

A burst of flame spat forth, the heat so intense I nearly stopped. I didn't, however, as its furious cry shifted into a dry screech and the thing reeled away, hands flying to its face.

Its head was in a blaze, the sounds it made becoming more strained and airy as fire ate away at it internally.

It shook its head like a wounded animal with such ferocity it slammed into the shelves on either side as it scratched and clawed away at its searing skin.

I should have continued, should have lit the thing from head to toe, but I was caught in a sickened awe at the gruesome sight.

The smell, already that of dying things, grew sharp and warm, coating my nose and throat.

As the blade sputtered to a singular flame, then a faint hiss, a strained silence fell over everything.

*On*.

The lights clicked back on with a *pop* making me jump with its return.

The thing glared at me - one of its eyes a ruined mess in its drooping socket as its face began to melt and peel like a Dali representation of a human - the other glistening with pain and hate.

The face, its melting mockery of Chelsea's face, drooped with a surreal, paint-like effect. I struggle still to describe what lie beneath.

It was like a hyper-realistic depiction of a child drawing of a human face, a nose that was merely a pair of small holes, its eyes two two pinpoints in a swollen, ridged skull reminiscent of a pumpkin.

Even still, a smile stretched across its charred features, half with its own small mouth, the other with what remained of its mirage.

"G - go," I sputtered, spraying another burst of flame in its direction.

It hissed, but didn't step forward. I heard a groan from the aisle beside us. Its singular eye darted to the side, and it cocked its head to the right, listening for something I couldn't hear.

It shuddered, chattering angrily, before speaking what I thought were its final words to me.

"Need…David…go find… you, David." it struggled to put the words together, but made sure its point was clear.

And with that, it scurried off, disappearing down the aisles and towards the exit, leaving me frozen in horror and disbelief.

The sound of things falling to the ground in the aisle beside me made my heart lurch, and reminded me of Chelsea.

I hurried over, still clutching my impromptu flamethrower as I rounded the shelf.

She lay in a heap on the ground, curled up in a half fetal position.

Recognition bloomed through the initial fear in her eyes as she saw me, and she hurried to her feet, rushing forward.

Claw marks gouged her face, and she shook wildly, but appeared otherwise okay.

"Matt, I have to go find Matt," she hurried past me towards the back door near the dumpsters.

I followed, and we hurried through the small stockroom and out of the back of the store.

I didn't see anything at first, but Chelsea cried out and rushed over towards the dumpster where I saw a pair of legs stretch out from behind it.

"Matt! Matt, get up! Matt!"

My heart dropped as I saw him, the panic in her voice and his utter stillness as well as the look of him making me think the worst.

His face was scarred, deep gashes digging through half of it as though he'd been mauled. Strange scars patterned his visible skin.

My heart dropped. In the distance an approaching siren blared.

Matthew coughed.

"Holy fuck," I breathed, "He's alive,"

Chelsea did her best not to let panic override her, still practically hyperventilating as Matt's eyes slowly began to flutter open.

"-*hhggh"*

Dark blood spurted from his mouth as he slurred his words. His eyes seemed to lock on me. The sirens grew nearer.

"Shhh, you're okay, you're okay, wait for the ambulance."

He coughed again.

"Th - there's a man, you have to -"

"It's fine, we're fine, he's gone."

I could hear faint conversation from within the store, the sirens coming to a halt at the front, the glow of emergency lights lighting up the night.

The rest of the night went by in a relative blur. We all spoke to the police, giving our accounts of the night's event, leaving nothing out despite the insanity of it all, and the looks it garnered.

The security footage was a bust, the cameras and corresponding computers all fried somehow when the power went out.

A random power surge, they say. I know better.

Matthew denied emergency medical, citing a lack of insurance, and Chelsea followed his lead so after a few hours of questioning the police and EMTs had all left the lot.

The store was closed for the rest of the night, but given that little was broken after a meager phone call with the manager apologizing for our trauma and offering a temporary increase to our employee benefits, the matter was considered resolved.

“Let the other two know when you see them, I’m not getting an answer.” he told me, and I agreed too tired to do otherwise.

Despite it all, I returned to work the next day.

After all, trauma and sob stories, no matter how reasonable, don't pay the rent.

Neither would employee discounts. I was content to try and erase the night's events from my mind, acting as if none of it had ever occurred. But recent events have deemed that impossible.

You see, I thought nothing of Matthew and Chelsea's absence the rest of that week.

Sure, I found it odd how none of my calls to either of them were answered but we all cope with trauma differently.

However, last night - almost a week after the ordeal - I received a call that has made it so I can't feel safe returning to work. I don't feel safe at all.

My manager called me before my latest shift, the tone in his voice immediately making my stomach bubbling with an odd sort of anxiety.

"The cops are looking to speak to Chelsea if you've heard from her," he had begun.

"Someone found a body in the bog near the store. I'm sorry - I know you guys were close but…it was Matt's."

I felt cold and hollow, as though every ounce of blood had evaporated into an icy mist in my veins.

"They say he's been there for about a week…I think they suspect maybe she had something to do with it. Brought him back here that night, I dunno. Anyways, you can, uh, take some time off."

When the call ended, I sat frozen with the phone to my ear, letting the dial tone blare as my mind raced, his words echoing in my mind with cavernous effect.

*He's been there for about a week.*

I had seen Matt that night, we both had. I'd watched him and Chelsea drive off that night, I'd…

Like a flashback, my mind replayed the image of that thing in the appearance of Chelsea, peering at me.

I had seen something that *looked* like Matt, a quiet mangled version of him at that.

My heart pumped panic through me as awful connections began to form. Suddenly, Chelsea and Matthew's complete radio silence made awful sense.

And that *things* threat bears new weight.

I believe Chelsea is dead by now, unfortunately.

Matthew too.

I don't think I'll be returning to work for a while, if ever. The paranoia has gotten overwhelming. I see monsters in every shadow, hear approaching death in the creak of every floor board.

Hell, even as I write this in my room, beside the window carrying in the late night breeze, I can't help but feel I can smell the faint, but growing scent of rot in the air.

God help me.

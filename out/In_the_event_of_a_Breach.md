Welcome to the Ferus.

Your level: 2

Your job: Office worker. You pay the bills send messages and Establish the Network between every Ferus Facility in the world. 

&#x200B;

The Ferus have many Facilities that contain many Entities, Anomaly's and other malicious Creatures. You are in Facility 7A Codename: White Wall.

While in the Facility you are relatively safe. Except in the event of a breach.

The Higher-ups have setup rules in case the Situation arises.

&#x200B;

When the alarm sounds you are to do the following:

&#x200B;

1. Should you hear the Alarm you are to Stop whatever you are doing and to Evacuate to your Sectors Safe zone immediately.

&#x200B;

2. If you are a Security agent or have Experience in Fire arms training then you are to Report to Sector 2 Security HQ immediately.

&#x200B;

3. If you are a Security agent in Sector 1 then you are Advised to not enter the Facility and into a Defensive position towards both Entrances.

&#x200B;

4. If you are in a Safe zone then remain vigilant as several entities or Anomalies can enter the Safe zone although unlikely.

&#x200B;

5. Remain in groups.

&#x200B;

6. Stay calm and Await rescue.

&#x200B;

If you are locked outside of your Safezone in the midst of a breach then you are to do the following:

&#x200B;

1. You must hide somewhere in your Sector. Whether it be a Office, Bedroom or Kitchen.

&#x200B;

2. You are advised not to remain out in the open or in Hallways for long. 

&#x200B;

3. If you feel something is watching you then you must ignore that feeling and lock yourself into a easily defendable room. Don't Show emotion.

&#x200B;

4. You must not sleep.

&#x200B;

5. Try not to make any especially loud noises especially in Sector 3.

&#x200B;

6. If you hear voices then don't react or shout back to them. Some of our Anomalies can Mimic the voices of who they kill.

&#x200B;

7. Some entities are especially smart, As a precaution do not Announce your location over the Radio.

&#x200B;

8. Try to be as calm as possible. We have a entity that can hear your Heartbeat.

&#x200B;

9. Remain vigilant. You are not safe.

&#x200B;

10 Remain calm and await rescue.

&#x200B;

If you were too "Accidently" sleep and wake up in a unfamiliar location then you are too:

&#x200B;

1. Something is hunting you while in the void. If you see a All black figure then RUN

&#x200B;

2 Mark where you are going somehow. Whether it be pieces of clothing, Hair or even Blood. It is extremely important that you know where you started.

&#x200B;

3 Start wandering the Void. Don't get lost.

&#x200B;

4 The Void is like a maze except the walls are slathered in a Black sticky substance, If it starts warping back into the facility then you have made it back to our Reality. Congratulations, But afterwards run.

&#x200B;

5 The void could potentially warp you Outside of the facility or even Back in time.

&#x200B;

If you were too Accidently sleep and wake up to a Person in the corner of your room, Then you are too:

&#x200B;

1. Slowly and quietly walk towards the entrance. Once you open the door run.

&#x200B;

2. However if you wakeup and the person is pointing at you and you can see its eyes then we are sorry to say that you are dead. Your family will get huge Compensation along as your Paycheck for the next 10 years.

&#x200B;

We hope you can survive, And if you survive then you will get a free 5 month vacation as we repair the damages and recapture any lost Entities. You will also get your daily Paycheck and 50,000 in Payment.

&#x200B;

Goodluck

&#x200B;

The Ferus.

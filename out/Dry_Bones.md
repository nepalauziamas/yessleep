Yes the title is exactly what you think it is.

I can also sort of guess what your thinking already-

"Who would be dumb enough to play one of those creepy ritual games?" 
Or "They aren't even real they're just dumb games made up by kids to scare one another."

As for my own opinion well,

As someone who can see and talk to the dead (Passed down only through the women of our family for some reason.) Obviously I believe that an afterlife exists.

You could say I have a morbid curiosity but zero courage. 

(I can handle seeing ghosts but if I see a demon your on your own bro I'm sorry.)

I enjoy reading about these rituals and games for fun- reading other people's accounts and experiences from the warmth and safety of my bed, wanting to know but not ballsy enough to do it myself.

I already see spirits and shit on a daily basis I don't need anything worse okay?

Or at least I thought I was safe.

I've never been dumb enough to go fooling around with Oujia boards or ritual games- And I never have. But obviously there's gotta be a reason I'm writing here right? here's the problem.

I didn't have too.

The other day I was looking through a website called "The ghost in my machine." Its a pretty good resource if you enjoy reading about the origins of these games and how play.

I'd read through most of them and was looking for something new and was just about to close the page when I noticed one I hadn't read before.

"Dry Bones."

I, of course immediately clicked on it hoping for a new creepy little story to read. 

If you haven't read it before reading this You probably won't understand this very much.

I read it eagerly, and of course it was another neat little creepy jem. I couldn't help but notice however a little note from the author that read the following-

"Even reading this might draw him near."

Now this-

This I shrugged off I mean, their must be ATLEAST a hundred other people reading this at the same time as I am so how would this even be plausible???

Even I just couldn't bring myself to believe something as outrageous as this.

And with that I closed the page and went on with my business.

Since then the groaning and whispering hasn't stopped.

'Its just the house it's old' 
or 
'its probably just someone outside walking past.' 

Atleast these are the things I've been telling myself.

I'd almost begun to believe I was right until the other night.

I was laying in bed awake around 12ish at night when the noises started up again.

I managed to ignore them for the most part until I heard what sounded like tapping coming coming from my vanity which sets in the corner of my room.

I looked up at the mirror.

I wish I hadn't.

There was this thing.

Pale face, red eyes, it had its long boney fingers pressed against the mirror.

When I looked at it, it almost seemed like it was grinning at me.

Yes I ran out of the room, and I ended up sleeping on the couch downstairs with all the lights on.

The groaning has gotten more consistent.

I've been sleeping on the couch for 2 days now.

"You have to go back to your room eventually."

Nope.

There's a list of things I won't do.

Now I'm adding something new.

I'll never read Dry bones again.

And you shouldn't either.

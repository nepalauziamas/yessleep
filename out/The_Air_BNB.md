Me and my husband have fallen into retirement in our early 60s, and have quite a large house for empty nesters.

We decided long ago to turn our garage into a guest house, but unfortunately it remains quite empty as family lives very close and there is no need for them to stay overnight. 

We decided why not make passive income and rent our guest house out through air BNB. 

The guesthouse is accessible through the back driveway, you enter through the patio doors at check in and the guest house entrance is inside the patio/pool area. 

The main house is attached to the pool but the windows are heavily tinted and if a guest has booked a stay they’re the only ones to use it. 

We’ve been hosting on air BNB for almost a year now, and I’ve grown to hate it. 

Our house rules are:

No drugs
No smoking inside
No animals
No parties
No loud noises after 11

That’s it, and somehow these young couples keep breaking almost every single one of them!

I could tolerate these guests bad habits, and usually I just told myself it was worth it because of how much money we were making, but this couple is honestly the worst!

A couple in their early 20s booked a night away for Mother’s Day, with their baby. 

They parked in the wrong spot. 

They were arguing the whole time they carried their things to the guesthouse. 

All was well, but they decided to go for the pool right away. 

The windows to the main house were open, and the young woman was wearing barley anything more than floss as a swimsuit. 

And they let their baby in our hot tub, which I find careless. 

They left the pool area a wreck and got food all over the patio, while using the grille they kept violently letting it SLAM shut. 

We have cameras in every room.

I’m watching her now, sitting on the couch, no pants or underwear, while changing. 

Disgusting. 

Who sits on a strangers couch with no clothing?!

Young adults these days have no decency. 

No modesty. 

They deserve what they get. 

They put the baby to sleep in a pack and play and the young man began to roll marijuana into a cigar in the same room as the child!

Appalling. 

They went outside to smoke and left the poor child unsupervised. 

I made sure to watch him extra carefully on the camera. 

The baby woke up and the young man went inside to tend to him, while the woman kept smoking. 

This was my chance. 

This boy deserves a better life. 

I grabbed the biggest knife I had from the kitchen,

I hope I still know how to do this… it’s been a long time…

I mustered all my courage and opened the door to the patio very, very slowly. 

Thankfully she was listening to music (even tho it’s past 11) and didn’t hear me slip up and let the door freak a bit. 

I walked very slowly, which is a lot harder now that I’m so old. 

I made my way behind her undetected. She looked up to the sky to blow smoke, and I struck quickly. 

The blade was freshly sharpened, just in case, and went through her throat rather smoothly. It did hurt my elbow a bit to move so swiftly, but nothing some potassium wouldn’t fix. 

She went quietly, I mean how can you scream when your throat isn’t whole, right?

Now the young man. 

Oh I hate it when I act out of anger! I never think these things through! Oh well.

It must be done now…

I had a great idea. 

I swiveled the girls patio chair around, to where her back was facing the door. 

I hid behind the door, and waited for him to come out for her. 

It took what felt like hours. 

But he finally came out. 

The automatic patio lights came on and he saw all the blood on the ground and her head laying limp in the chair, he immediately screamed and ran to her, as he got to the chair I walked right up to him and stabbed his jugular. 

He looked shocked as I pulled my knife out of him. 

He fell forward on top of his partner. 

I set my knife down on the table in front of them and went inside the guest house, washed myself up a bit, and checked on the baby. 

Sound asleep in the play pen. 

Oh how I hated being an empty nest. 

And how I hated those air BNB guests. 

I guess in the end Howard was right, my temper does get the best of me. 

Oh is he ever going to be mad that it happened again.  

He isn’t as young as he used to be, I know the cleanup won’t be so easy. 

But I know he’ll be so happy we have another little one, a sweet baby boy. 

Tomorrow I must get this room and the back patio tidied up,

We have guests coming at dawn.

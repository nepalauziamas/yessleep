Last Friday I was driving on a windy backroad in the mountains of rural Utah. I was around ten miles from the nearest town when my engine died. 

I pulled out my phone to look at the map. There was no service, but I’d downloaded a map of the area just in case. I saw that, if I followed the road, it was a ten mile walk that wound back and forth along some backroads. I didn’t like that idea very much.

I also saw that the town was actually only two miles away as the crow flies. In a direct line from me, I’d just have to climb a little bit to cut my journey down. I shot a look up the mountain, left a note on my car saying what I was doing, and set off through the brush.

That part of Utah didn’t have much underbrush, just some scraggly bushes and the occasional tree clinging to life in the dry soil. I was making good time, and soon had shut off my phone’s light to rely on the moon which was a bright pearl in the sky. When my eyes had adjusted, it was almost like walking around in the daytime. The valley extended for dozens of miles to my right, and the weather was only slightly chilly with the wind.  

That was when I heard a baby’s cry, low on the wind. It was far off in the distance to my left, slightly higher up the slope. I paused, listening hard. It came again, unmistakably the pinched short cry of a newborn infant. 

I paused for a moment before heading in the direction of the call. There was no one around for miles, and now there’s this kid? 

After a few minutes of walking, I stumbled across what had to have been a hundred-year-old cemetery. There were no headstones, just rocks marking the spots where the people must’ve been buried. I couldn’t hear any more crying.

I took a short video walking around the cemetery which you can see here:

I put my phone away in my back pocket, listening hard for the kid. I figured it must’ve been an animal. I thought I’d heard that coyotes could mimic human cries.

Then I turned to look at the moon, only now noticing it was had been ringed by thick dark clouds. Almost as if on cue, the clouds rushed forward. Over the course of five seconds, the cemetery went from lit up by moonlight, to pitch blackness.

The clouds must’ve been covering every star in the sky as well as the moon. The darkness was complete. I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. It was so black that it seemed almost physical, enveloping and dulling each of my senses.

Then the baby cried again from my left, loud and piercing.

I jerked, caught my foot on a rock, and fell forward against on of the fences. The baby was shrieking loudly. It couldn’t have been more than a few feet away, just on the other side of the fence. I pushed back, sticking my hand into my pocket, feeling for my phone to turn on a light.

That’s when the dry papery fingers slid around the back of my throat. Nails dug into the skin, and I thought I heard a high raspy giggle from behind me just before they began to squeeze.

I jerked forward, flipped on my light, and spun around. 

There was nothing there.

I ran away, trying to put as much distance between myself and the cemetery as I could. When I finally reached the town, I put my hand up to my neck and felt the scrapes on my neck. I told myself it was just a tree, but I knew that wasn’t true. 

I managed to get an old mechanic to come help me with my car. On the way back I asked him a question about a cemetery up in the hills. He stiffened, looked at me, and said:

We don’t go up there. We know better.

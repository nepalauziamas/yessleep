There’s a weird smell in my house.

I know I have three dogs and I now live with two other guys; one works in construction and the other one is an artsy, hippie guy…so I’m used to some smells, however, this smell is different.

I already checked under the couch and tv stand where one of my dogs usually hoards food, nothing.
Emptied all trash cans and cleaned the garbage disposal and dish washer hoses in case it was that. Smell is still stanking. 

When the last roommate moved out he left a bunch of stuff behind he asked me hold on to until he could come back to pick it up; a mattress, mini fridge, fan, desk etc. There was also a robotic litter box for his two cats. That shit was heavy. I looked inside it and it was empty but still pretty heavy and smelled fine, well as fine as a litter box can smell. 

He was a depressed millennial who wanted to keep acting like he was in his early 20s, he vaped whenever DoorDash didn’t pay him an incentive or when his latest attempt to sue his last employer didn’t work out. Most of his stuff smelled like bad decisions and weed oil. But that’s not the smell that was bothering me.

After he moved out I had to clean his room so I could rent it out. It wasn’t too bad, just some food crumbs under his bed and a fuck ton of double sided tape everywhere. He had pictures on his windows and walls of his family and friends and his two cats. 

Before he moved out we talked about him finding a foster home for the two cats because he could barely take care of himself and I felt bad for the cats to have to keep moving from one place to another one. He didn’t take that the right way and I get it, if someone were to tell me to get rid of my dogs I would not want to hear it even if it was for their own good. Sadly I could not take the cats because I already have 3 beasts and can’t have any more pets. 

The day before he moved out I asked him to wait for me to get home so I could keep an eye on the dogs so they would not run out the door while he was moving things out. He texted me 20 minutes before I got home to let me know he was done loading his car and was heading out, that he would be back to get his stuff eventually, and thanked me for my patience(he was always late on rent). 

I was kind of annoyed he didn’t wait for me but whatever, at least he was gone. I checked the cameras to make sure he didn’t take anything valuable - “Where do you find these roommates??” you may be asking…it’s Vegas, you try finding someone normal). 

He didn’t have a lot of stuff so it all fit in his Honda Civic, except for his bed and other aforementioned large items he left behind. I did not see him take the cats out, but maybe that clip was missing.

He was in and out taking stuff to his car for like 30 minutes, but the dogs did not seem to care. 

They were focused on a plastic bag he had by the laundry room. I figured it was trash that he was taking to the garage where I keep the trash cans. 

While hunting for the source of the smell today I also drained the water pump on my washer, according to some guy on RepairTok; washing machines sometimes keep stagnant water around if the pumps are failing. That wasn’t the source of the smell either. 

So I checked the laundry room closet.

I found the bag the dogs were so interested in the day the roommate moved out. I also found out why there was no footage of him taking out the cats.

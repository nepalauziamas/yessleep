I am currently doing an online college mostly because I'm not a people person. It's pretty easy staying home and doing my schoolwork online.

Even though it's cheaper doing it online I still try to make money. I usually will babysit for people for $10 an hour, and I've made over $140 doing it.

My dad told me a man he works with is taken his wife on a date Saturday night. He needs someone to babysit their son while there out. My dad gave me the address and Saturday night I would be watching this couple's son.

When Saturday came I drove to the couple's house and when I got there I saw they had a big house. I went up to the door and knocked on their door, and the door quickly opened. I saw a man standing there who looked to be in his late 40s dressed up like he was going to the ball.

"Hello, you must be frank's daughter" he gave off a creepy smile before inviting me in. The house looked even bigger from the inside "Our son Tommy is in his room we made him dinner, you have to bring it to his room though." 

Just then his wife came downstairs, she was old but tried to look young. He took his wife's hand and quickly tried to get her out the door "Well be back by 9:30." He then slammed the door shut and they drove off.

Confused by why they tried to leave so fast I decided to sit on their big could and text my friend. Eventually, I heard their son calling out for me so I went upstairs. When I got to the door I knocked on it asking what he needs.

"I'm hungry" I went downstairs to get his food and when I opened the fridge and a horrible smell blasted in my face. I looked and saw a bunch of flies and raw and bloody food. There were raw pork chops or what I hoped to be with his name on it. So I brought it to him trying to puke from the smell.

I knocked on the door telling him I had his food and it slightly opened and a hand grabbed it. The door slammed shut and I heard him eating it on the other side and at that point, I wanted to leave. I sat back on the couch and texted my friend about what just happened but she didn't believe me.

I don't know when but I eventually fell asleep on the couch. I awoke to a slamming noise, I thought it was the son so I went upstairs and saw the door open. I saw a bunch of plates lying on his floor with flies everywhere.

I went back downstairs and heard noises coming from the kitchen. When I peeked in I almost screamed, there was someone who was 8 feet tall eating raw bloody meat. I tried to leave but I bumped into a vase that fell over and shattered.

He looked over at me and yelled "Me was hungry and you didn't give me food" I realized this was the couple's son. He started drooling and said "Me eat you" I tried to run but his long arm grabbed me and wouldn't let go.

So I grabbed a piece of the broken vase and stabbed his arm, he let go of me and screamed but I got the fuck out of there. I ran to the neighbor's house and called the cops.

The cops eventually arrived and when they went in but did know one was in there but they noticed the back door was open. I told them about the parents but they couldn't get ahold of them and they haven't found them yet.

To this day I haven't babysat for anyone and I'm scared of leaving the house because I fear running into that 8-foot giant.

"And today's 'Wacky Weather' photo has been sent in by a lovely lady named Jenny", the weatherman said in his usual, excited voice, "As you can see, Jenny spotted this cloud that looks exactly like a cow. How a-moo-sing".

Randy Shineglow, the local TV weatherman stopped speaking and flashed a cheesy grin, that crinkled his large, grey moustache, towards the camera. Randy was known for his corny jokes and bad puns, but that didn't stop him from being the most beloved television personality in town. His career had spanned decades and if you had been born in the past thirty years, then you would have grown up watching his weather reports.

The man just oozed charisma, in the same way that a burst water main oozes water. This is probably a testament to his long running and dignified career. He was the main reason that everyone tuned in to the news each night, and he certainly was the reason I was watching it. 

Randy Shineglow flicked off the screen and was replaced by an image of a cloud that sat high in the sky. It did look remarkably like the bovine animal. The cow-shaped cloud was complete with a long snout, four legs and wispy udders that hung underneath. There were also dark flecks of cloud that ran along the body, that made it appear that this cow was covered in spots. 

I let out a slight chuckle at the uncanny similarity to the large animal, and then I saw Randy reappear on the screen, who seemed to be chuckling at the cloud as well. He then looked directly into the camera and began his usual sign off.

"Well, what a fun way to end this weather report, I certainly enjoyed it", he uttered enthusiastically, "And so that's all from me and, as I always say, why just glow when you can shine?".

Randy flashed one more big smile towards the screen, before the image changed to his colleague, David Hue. David was the less popular member of the newscasting duo, but it is easy to pale in comparison to such a legend of the screen. David Hue's face was a lot more serious than the jovial Randy, and it quickly became apparent as to why he was looking more earnest. 

"Speaking of that particular farm animal, there is some breaking news just in. A woman has been trampled to death by an escaped cow", he said in a rather solemn tone. "Police have confirmed that the creature escaped from a nearby paddock and ran over the woman, who was hiking through close-by bushland. The location of the escaped cow is still unknown".

David Hue then moved on to a lighter story about a dog that befriended a duckling, and then he said goodbye to the town. The outro music was just starting to blare when I switched the television off. I got up off of the couch where I had been sitting and wandered over to the window that overlooked my garden as I pondered what I had just heard.

The thought of the cow shaped cloud had absorbed my mind, and the fact that a woman had been killed by the same creature on the same day. I'm sure it was just a coincidence, but the idea that maybe it wasn't, was beginning to take hold of my brain. This hypothesis grew and filled the inside of my head, like a cloud slowly evaporating water. There was absolutely no basis for my reasoning, but I just had a strong feeling that it was somehow connected. This suspicion was almost confirmed the following day. 

I was standing outside in my rather small but luscious garden, looking up towards the sky. It looked like a giant canvas that had been painted blue, with only one small grey cloud, like a tiny splodge of paint. The cloud seemed almost perfectly spherical with a tiny pinprick of dark black cloud in the centre. From where I was standing it looked as if a large eye was peering down on me. 

I looked up at the lonely cloud, pondering the thoughts I had had the previous. After a night of mulling it over in my head, I realised how preposterous the idea that a cloud could predict the future was. But something still told me that it could be somehow connected. I watched the cloud in silent contemplation, the strange thoughts stayed firmly planted within my head. 

I don't think that I actually expected to see any evidence to support my wild theory. It was just that; a theory. So, I was still surprised and perplexed when I saw the eyeball shaped cloud slowly begin to change. Like a strong wind was blowing it, the wisps of cloud drifted apart across the sky, before reforming. Once each individual streak of cloud had found one another again, it looked completely different to the sphere that it had once been. 

The grey cloud had now manifested itself as a small hatchback. Small puffs of white foam-looking substance made up its sweeping roof and bonnet. Four wheels were attached to the underside of the Cumulus cloud. Sunlight streamed out from behind it, emanating from the two headlights at the front of the vehicle. It was the most realistic and lifelike cloud I had ever seen. I immediately knew that this wasn't just an act of nature. This was a warning.

The warning in the sky didn't have much time to actually warn anyone about what was about to transpire.  Because, almost immediately after, I heard the screech of tyres. The screech of rubber on tarmac sounded out, breaking the otherwise silent afternoon. Following the high pitched squeal, came a dull but audible thudding sound, accompanied by a blaring human scream. 

"And so, the victim of the cow attack has been identified as local Jenny Smittons", David Hue said, looking directly down the camera.

"And from one tragic story to another", he continued, "A young man, in his early thirties, has been struck and killed by a car today. The small hatchback's brakes failed and sent the car hurtling towards the man. He died instantly, and eye witness accounts describe an out of control car that 'seemed destined to hit someone' ".

The screen changed to an interview with a young man who was describing what he saw when he arrived at the accident site. It was strange to see myself on the TV screen, but there I was, giving an account of what I had witnessed that day. Of course, whilst being interviewed, I never mentioned my bizarre cloud theory, but that didn't mean I had stopped believing in it. In fact, the evidence to confirm my thoughts had grown. It could still be all a coincidence, but it just didn't seem like it was. 

My mind was overtaken by rampant thoughts about what it could all mean, and the television faded into the background. My mind only cleared and the TV regained my attention once I saw the familiar face of Randy Shineglow light up the screen. I wanted to see if he was going to mention the car shaped cloud that hung in the sky only moments before the horrific car crash.

Randy smiled towards the camera and gleefully read out the week's forecast and made his usual puns and jokes. He never once mentioned the cloud that had been looming over the accident site. Randy finished the weather report and signed off with his signature catch phrase. I switched the television off in anger. 

It was four days later, when I saw the camera crew, when I finally got some answers to this mystery. I was walking along one of the smaller streets in town, near the parklands, when I saw a group of people carrying filming equipment. There was a small gathering of people standing around watching what was occurring. I meandered over to the group, curious as to what was going on. Despite constantly watching the sky, I hadn't seen any strange clouds, so I didn't think that this was related to that in any way. 

When I approached, I saw a film crew and a few other smartly dressed people, and one person that I recognised instantly. It was Randy Shineglow. He was standing in front of a large camera and was holding a microphone. I quickly deduced that this was a live broadcast of today's weather report. It was also a good opportunity to talk to Randy about what I had noticed. 

I patiently waited for the weather report to wrap up. Watching Randy live though, was even more impressive than seeing him inside the screen. His charisma seemingly overwhelmed the entire crowd and they were all enthralled by his presence. I, too, was taken under his spell and found myself thoroughly enjoying his live performance. 

The report concluded and Randy gave the microphone to someone that was handling equipment, and beamed a smile out to the crowd of gathered onlookers. He thanked everyone for being there, and then he even made his way through the crowd, giving handshakes to anyone that wanted one. I eagerly awaited my turn to shake the legendary weatherman's hand, because it would be an honour, but also so I could ask him about what my suspicions. 

Randy handshaked his way through the small horde of people, and soon enough he approached me. His hand was outstretched, his face was bright and cheerful and his moustache was even more impressive in person. I excidetly grasped his hand and firmly shook it. His grip was even stronger than what I could muster, and somehow, even his handshake came across as professional. I then looked directly into his eyes and asked the question.

"Have you ever experienced a cloud that could predict someone's death?", I asked him quite seriously. 

He stared at me more a moment before responding. I couldn't help but notice a small flinch of his eyebrow and when he spoke, some of his warmth that was previously there had now vanished. 

"Of course not, what on earth do you mean, son?", he replied, an inflection of worry present in his usually calm voice.

"It's just that I've seen it happen. First, it was the cow. And then the car. You can't tell me that it was all a coincidence.", I replied, hoping that Randy would actually know what I was talking about.

Randy lowered the volume of his voice, so that people nearby couldn't hear what he was saying. 

"You best meet me by my car. You see the black one over there. Meet me there in five minutes.", he said before turning around to greet another person.

Maybe I was right and there was actually some substance to my speculation. I used to watch clouds as a child and see what mesmerising shapes and patterns they could create. I always thought that this was just a whimsical delight that I experienced in my younger years, but what if there was something darker forming in the clouds? What if some sort of horror was just sitting there in the sky?

I anxiously walked towards the black car, unsure of what I was about to uncover. I made it there before Randy did and so I was left waiting, rather impatiently, for him to arrive. Ten or so minutes after when he told me to meet him, I saw him approaching me, his face looking rather serious. He walked up to me, maybe slightly too close, and began to speak.

"What do you know about the clouds?", he asked, in a forceful but hushed tone. 

"I don't know anything for sure", I responded, "Only that two people are dead, and the way they died was projected into the sky only moments before they were killed."

"Well, it could be a coincidence", he said, but he didn't seem convinced that it was. "It is curious, however".

"Do you know anything about it? Have you heard of this occurring before?"

"I have heard about this sort of thing. There used to be a rumour in the social circle of meteorologists. They suggested that clouds could predict the future. Predict your demise. Of course, I believe that it is just a myth that meteorologists tell each other. Those poor souls need something to entertain them."

He stopped speaking for just a moment, to let out a loud chuckle. He then continued.

"But, the rumour was that, if you saw a perfectly spherical grey cloud that had a dark centre, then you could call upon it to reveal your fate. You would need to stare at the cloud, without blinking, until your eyes began to water. Once a single tear seeped from your eye and streamed down your face, you would need to call out to the cloud to reveal your destiny. I think the tear is supposed to be a small offering of water, or something like that. But, if you do this correctly, the cloud will transform into whatever it is that is supposed to finish you off. Your death could come straight away, or the cloud could be foretelling an event that is still many years away.  Of course though, this is just a story". 

I listened intently to what he was saying, but everything he said seemed to coincide with what I had seen. The small grey cloud. The dark centre. It transforming into something else. Everything fit together perfectly. 

"You don't believe that this is actually something that could happen?", I asked Randy after pondering for a second.

"Don't be silly, boy. Of course not. Now, if you don't mind, I best be going."

Randy lifted his hand and shook mine one more time, before walking past me and climbing into his car. I watched him leave, thoughts swirling inside my head. I think he had just answered some of my questions. Even if he didn't believe it, I was convinced it was real. There was only one way to find out though. 

I stayed inside the parkland for the next few hours, lying down on its soft grass, looking up towards the soft blue sky. It was a sunny day, with no clouds in sight. Part of me hoped to see the small grey cloud appear, but a part of me begged not to see it. Everyone else that had called upon the cloud had almost immediately met their untimely death. But, as Randy said, it could still be years before the clouds prophecy came true. 

I continued to stare up at the sky, and watched as the sun began to lower, like a magnet was dragging it towards the horizon. Light was fading, and visibility was going with it. I was still able to see it though. The perfectly round grey cloud that drifted across the sky and sat just above me. It had actually appeared. I got nervous, as I knew what I was about to do. I was about to call up to it.

The fear within me steadily grew, and I felt the usual signs of being scared. As Randy Shineglow would say; there is a high chance of perspiration along the brow, and avoid the spine, as shivers are currently running down it. To say I was nervous would be a rather large understatement. 

I persisted anyway, curious as to whether the old rumour was real or not. I stared up at the cloud with my eyes fully open. I continued to stare and felt a stinging sensation begin to creep in. My eyes were drying out and with that came a stinging pain. I felt moisture starting to develop with my eye socket, and soon enough, I felt a single teardrop roll down my cheek. As it did, I called out to the sky. 

"Show me my fate. Reveal my destiny", I called into the openness of the parkland. 

Once I began speaking, I realised that I was entirely sure what to call out, and just hoped that what I said was correct. My heartbeat increased and I felt my breathing get heavier as I saw the grey cloud start to seperate. The cloud broke up into smaller strands that spread out over the twilight sky. As quickly as they broke up, they started to put themselves back together, but in a different formation. 

I watched on as the cloud grew and started to form an entirely different picture. A picture that would reveal how I was to die. Each strand of cloud connected with another one, creating a formation that I didn't want to see. It created something worse than I ever could've imagined. 

Hanging in the sky, made entirely of cloud, was an unearthly creature that was looking directly towards me. It was made of a collection of dark grey and black clouds and took up most of the sky. It had long, goat-like legs that connected to a large torso that sprouted two long arms. Its arms ran along its body and long, sharp claws extended out of its hands. A large head that was complete with long, curled horns sprouting from its forehead. Its eyes were two, completely black clouds that appeared to be looking straight towards me. 

The cloud that made up the creature's arm slowly raised, like it was being lifted in the wind. One of its long, sharp fingers pointed downwards, directly at me. I felt my body go numb in pure shock and fear as to what had manifested in front of my eyes. I couldn't move, as fear was keeping me grounded to the grass. I then watched the clouds start to dissipate, revealing a clear sky once more. 

So far, nothing has transpired, but I truly believe that the clouds have revealed my fate. I don't know exactly what is to become of me, but I live in constant fear as to what that creature, or demon, has in store for me. I hope that it is still many years away, but I will never know. I shouldn't have done the ritual to reveal my demise, but curiosity got the better of me, and I revealed something I wished I never knew.

 

It was a special day for me as I was going to visit my family. I got up early and dressed well. After getting a quick bite to eat, I hit the road. I soaked in the town's beauty that I lived.   


Everyone’s lawn looked terrific. For as long as I lived there, the town was beautiful. It was a very safe town, as the latest crime was a little over fifty years ago. I turned on the radio to listen to my favorite radio station. Shortly after, an emergency warning came on. It talked about there being a chance of floods. I shrugged it off and kept driving.   


After a few more hours of driving, I finally reached my parent's house. The flowers that were next to the front door still looked beautiful, like every year. I got out of my car and walked up the pathway, and knocked on the door. My mother opened the door and hugged me.   
“We’re so happy you visited. We have missed you so much!”  
“I missed you mom,”   
She walked me over to the kitchen table where the rest of our family sat. And that’s when I saw him. My brother John sat to the right of where I was going to sit. We never got along and would get into arguments, so I decided not to say anything to him ‌to not ruin it.   


Sitting to my left was Uncle Robert. He has always been my favorite uncle ever since I was a kid. I remember he would always give me candy before I went to bed. My mother was furious every time he did it. My cousins, Bob and Lewis, sat across from me. I never really hung out with them, so we didn’t know each other. My mother and father brought in lots of food. I stacked my plate with fries, rice, and a hamburger.  
“I finally got my medical degree.” One of my cousins said. Everyone except John congratulated him on it as we knew he worked very hard to get it. “What about you?” My mother said, looking at me. “Not too much has changed.” John chuckled and said, “Of course, nothing changed.” I kept eating my hamburger while trying to ignore him.  


 “Hey Mike, remember Catherine? She was such a whore,” he said with a smirk on his face. “Do not talk about my dead wife like!” I said, clenching my fist. He laughed, and that’s when I slammed my fist on the table and stood up. “Jesus Christ.” my father said, standing up. “That’s enough from both of you. You’re both upsetting your mother. Now both of you need to act like adults or you can both get out.” I grabbed my jacket on the back of the chair and left the house, as I couldn’t say another word without shouting. I sat down on a chair next to the front door. My mother came out and sat on the chair next to me. 

“I’m sorry for what your brother said in there. Tomorrow, how about you go with me and your father to the movies tomorrow?”

“Sure. That sounds nice.” I said, still looking down at my lap."  
“We’ll be going to it at seven, as there’s a movie your father really wanted to see. When you show up at the movie theatre, we’ll be waiting outside for you.”

“Ok. I’m gonna go now as it’s pretty late and I don’t want to oversleep.” I said, getting up from the chair and walking to my car. “I love you.” My mother shouted at me. “I love you too, mom,” I said, turning to look at her. I got in my car and pulled out of her driveway. The traffic was horrible, so it took me longer than I thought to get to a hotel. I pulled in and parked my car. After getting out, I grabbed my wallet and walked inside. I walked over to the clerk and said. 

“I would like a room with one bed, please.”   
“How many nights will you be staying?”  
“Just two nights,” I said, handing him my card. He handed me my card back alongside the room key. After I thanked him, I went up the stairs and towards my room. Once in my room, I locked my door and walked over to my bed. And fell asleep immediately. The next morning, I pulled out my phone and checked the time. It was 8:02. I got out of bed and remember that I didn’t have any other clothes to change into, as I only planned to visit for the day.   


After killing time, it was finally time to go watch the movie. I got in my car and drove to the movie theatre. It was bigger than I remembered. I saw my parents near the entrance. After getting out, I walked over to them and we went inside. Once we got our popcorn and drinks, we walked into the movie and sat down. When it was over, I hugged my mother and father goodbye as I was leaving in the morning.   


I drove to the hotel and fell back asleep on the bed almost instantly. Once I woke up, I got in my car and hit the road. Once I reached my town, I noticed there was heavy rain still going on. It was odd as we would get rain at least eight times a month in summer and when did; it wasn’t much. There were cars in front that got in a crash.   


But the strange thing was no one was in it. I pulled up and got out of my car. The pouring rain soaked my shirt as I walked over to the cars. The driver's side window was broken. I quickly got in my car and started driving all around my town. Cars were everywhere on the road, but they all had their driver's side windows broken in. I pulled up in front of my neighbor's house and got out of my car. I walked up his stairs and noticed his door was open.   


After thinking about whether I should enter the house or get into my car and get the hell out of this town, I entered the house. The inside of the house was a mess. All of his vases were shattered. I walked into the kitchen and that’s when I noticed a massive pool of blood and a trail of blood to the backdoor. Then that’s when I heard someone enter the house. I quickly got on the floor and hid behind the kitchen counter. Just as I did, I heard what sounded like another footstep by the backdoor.  
“We got them all.” the one by the backdoor said in a sadistic tone. “No.” the other said,   
“There’s one more. There’s a car parked outside this house.”   
“I understand. We’ll find him.”  
They both walked out of the house. My heart was racing. What the fuck was happening? Who were those people?. Whoever they were, I didn’t want to stick around to find out. My best bet was to get to my car and drive away. But then I heard what sounded like glass breaking and someone hitting metal. After waiting for a while after the noise stopped,  


 I got up from behind the counter and ran outside. They smashed all the windows in my car. The driver's side door was ripped off and all the tires were flat. My hope disappeared as I saw the condition of my car.   


I saw a group of them heading in my direction, so I am now hiding in my house. So please, if you return home and you see your town abandoned, just leave and never come back.

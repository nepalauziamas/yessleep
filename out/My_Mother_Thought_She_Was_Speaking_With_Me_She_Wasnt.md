 My alarm woke me up in the morning. I was still a student at the time, so I had to wake up early. My mother was in the kitchen making some coffee. She worked until midnight, so usually, she arrived home when I was already asleep, so her question surprised me.

“Did you fall asleep quickly after I came home?” she asked. 

“Uhm, I wasn’t even awake. I fell asleep around 10,” I responded. She looked at me like I was crazy.

“No, you were awake. I checked your room when I arrived, and we talked about school, don’t you remember?”

“What?” I raised my eyebrows. I always remembered when I woke up in the middle of the night, and I was sure I wasn’t awake when she came home from work. “I don’t remember any of this.”

“I asked how many classes you will have today, and you answered me. It looks like you forgot,” she laughed.

It was a strange conversation, but then I went to school and had already forgotten about it. It started to get a bit creepy when the next morning the same thing happened. 

“You were awake again when I came home at midnight,” my mom said. “Why didn’t you sleep?”

“I wasn’t awake,” I responded, drinking my coffee. 

“Are you joking, right? You told me you’ll have a test today.”

“I didn’t,” I argued.

“You might have some kind of memory problems, son. Maybe you should visit the doctor.”

“I’m 100% sure I wasn’t awake at midnight.”

I was thinking about this the whole day in school. Maybe I had some kind of memory loss? It was so strange, and it never happened before. Then I had an idea to make an audio recording of the night with my phone. I set it all up before I went to sleep. I quickly fell asleep, as always. 

When I woke up in the morning, I immediately checked the recording. I fast-forwarded to midnight. I heard my own voice on the recording.

“Hi, mom,” my voice said. It was really my voice. Maybe my mom was right, and I really had memory loss?

“Hi, sweetie,” my mom’s voice responded. “You are awake again. I hope you won’t forget this conversation too in the morning.”

“I hope I won’t, haha. If I do, you should send me to the doctor this time.”

“Haha, goodnight, son.”

“Goodnight!”

The audio recording was over, and I just sat on my bed, frozen and sweating. I had no recollection of this conversation. I was sure it didn’t happen, just like on the previous two nights.

When I walked into the kitchen, my mom looked at me.

“You look like you saw a ghost, honey,” she said without a greeting. 

“I just don’t remember anything from the previous nights. I even listened to an audio recording I made during the night to make sure I was awake or not.”

“You need to see a doctor,” she responded with a worried look. 

“Yeah, I know,” I slowly nodded. “I just hope it’s nothing serious.”

Luckily, I could get an appointment with the doctor on the same day during the afternoon. I was there for about two hours. After that, the doctor told me the results. I don’t know what I expected, but the outcome frightened me. 

I was healthy. I was 100% healthy. I had no memory problems, and my brain was functioning correctly, with no medical condition. I told the doctor what happened, and why I was there. 

“That’s strange,” he said. “Maybe you were half asleep, that’s why you can’t remember what happened.”

“But on the audio recording, I sounded like I was totally awake and conscious.”

“Nobody can understand the human brain, but you are healthy, mate, so don’t worry about that!”

As I walked home, I was still confused. I was healthy, but I still couldn’t remember anything from the previous three nights. It was such a strange feeling, and I was thinking about visiting another doctor, just to make sure. 

I arrived home and was prepared to tell my mother the results, as she wasn’t at work that day. When I opened the door and walked inside, I heard her talking with someone. *That’s strange, we usually don’t have visitors this late,* I thought. I also found it strange that I didn’t hear anyone else’s voice. Maybe she was talking with someone on phone?

As I approached her room, I could hear her better. 

“Yes, sweetie, we’ll renovate your room as soon as possible,” she said. “But I still don’t understand why do you need an altar there.”

I started to freak out at that point. An altar? I opened her door, and he looked at me surprised.

“An intruder! Who are you?” She screamed at me. She looked to her left and spoke to someone, but nobody was there. “Son, who is this man? He’s a servant of the devil? Oh my god!”

“What are you talking about, mom?” I asked. “I’m your son. Are you okay?

“Stay there, demon,” she screamed at me again. “My son told me you are dangerous!”

“But I’m your son!” I argued.

She pulled out a kitchen knife from her table and pointed it at me. I froze. *Is she crazy?*

“If you don’t leave the house, I will kill you right here. We’ll kill him, right, son?” she looked to her left again. 

I had no idea what to do, so I just ran out of the room, then ran to the bathroom, locked myself, and called the police. While I was talking to them, my mother still screamed from outside, talking to me and the “other me”. She also kicked the bathroom door a few times, but luckily, the door stood still. 

About ten minutes went by until the police arrived. It seemed like forever. When they tried to arrest her, she attacked them, but luckily, she couldn’t harm any of them.

One day she was fine, but then she tried to kill me while talking to someone in her imagination. Then I remembered the audio recording. She wasn’t imagining things. I heard my voice too. I went pale immediately as I remembered this fact. She was really talking with someone who imitated my voice. [I wasn't safe in my house anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/polgari/).

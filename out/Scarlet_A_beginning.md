I decided to write this journal because of an incident that happened today the thing in the drain got out, but before I get into that I should tell you about my bar. It's a bit more special than most not only does it provide information about the stranger thing in the world to people, but it also attracts the odder things like the faceless people, the immortals, the hole in the cellar, and the focus of today's entry the thing in the drain.

The thing has been here as long as I have which is saying something. I have always just used it as a disposal for almost all things including some unsavory things, but it never acted up to this extent before. Shure, sometimes I would come down in the morning to a long black chitinous limb sticking out of the drain but it never fully came out before today. Today was supposed to be the first day that I opened the bar after the incident with the men of the forest, but as I came down the stairs I heard a deep slurping sound and saw a long dark abomination sliding out of the sink. I rushed to the sink but as I got closer I could not hear the normal gurgling and clicking sounds so I knew something was wrong then I saw the trail of sludge that was composed of sink gunk that led down into the cellar.

As I looked down the stairs into the dark dank cellar realized where it was going. The Hole. But seeing as the thing is technically store property  I had to try to catch it asap because absolutely can't lose more of that and I don’t want to go into the hole, so I charged in before I could think of the consequences. I frantically looked around the nearly endless cellar to try and find the thing, but I could tell that it had already gone deeper based on the gunk trail. As I followed it deeper I pulled out my work-mandated handgun in case I encountered any one of the “spiders” but after what felt like hours of fowling the gunk trail, I could finally hear it in the distance. It was a deep crunching followed by a deep guttural gurgling followed by a quiet clicking. When I got closer I could see its black body that led around a corner into the pantry but, as I approached I heard a large crash fowled br a sharp screeching as the body zipped deeper into the cellar I started running after it but when I rounded the corner I was confronted by a massive 24ft long pitch black centipede wrapping around a pillar chasing after so many “spiders” and seeing as one of my responsibilities is clearing them out I wasn't complaining, but I couldn't let the thing get hurt so I ran up to the pillar and dragged it off the pillar as it thrashed around still trying to get to the “spiders” but as I pulled it around the corner into the main hallway I noticed that there was what appeared to be a dark shadow of a great unknowable thing before the lights clicked on. 

After that, I dragged the thing as fast as I could out of that god damned cellar now I have to call my boss and tell him I can't open the store today because it's not safe enough to open so to keep my mind off of that you guys have any idea on what I should name the thing from the drain because the more I look at him the cuter he is. Oh, and does anyone have any idea why he would have come out of the drain?

sorry for any grammar errors I'm not on mobile just bad at writing

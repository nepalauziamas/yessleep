I live in Texas, which I sometimes joking call ‘The Under Construction State’ – seriously – there is always at least one street within a 5 mile radius of where I live with my best friend Clara, that is under construction at any given time.

I hate driving, but I’ve grown to love the little 2 lane highway that connects my parents’ town to mine. It goes over a fork in the Trinity River, and you see a mix of scrubby mesquite trees that transition into more dense oaks that lead down to the drop off into the water. It’s just so much prettier than the other option, an overcrowded highway that has awkward merges and frequent accidents (and construction) – You can go 60 on this small highway too; It’s the perfect highway for people who hate highways. It makes the 20 mile drive each way go by much faster, so it’s the route I always take there and back.

A few weeks ago, I had driven out early in the morning for my cousin’s high school graduation – by the time the ceremony and the celebrations were over, it was almost midnight. Throughout the night, my mom asked us if we wanted to stay over, but we just wanted to get home, I also had an exam the next day and I had not studied nearly as much as I needed to.

We should have stayed.

The next parts are fuzzy, but I remember turning on to the highway and not long after, seeing two, large, wideset eyes that seemed to appear out of nowhere, reflecting in my headlights. I remember the panic and being unsure if I should slam on my breaks or try and swerve, I think I did a bit of both.

I remember the screech of the tires, the sound of a collision. A loud crack. I vaguely recalled hearing screaming – why was there so much screaming? At the time I thought it was me, but the more my memory has returned, the more I know that sound will haunt me forever.

When I opened my eyes, I had been slumped over the airbag, my seatbelt tight against my chest. My body felt stiff, and the air in the car felt cold. Colder than it should’ve felt that this time of year when it’s routinely in the 80s even this early in the morning. The interior lights were on, the car was making a pinging sound, and was flashing a myriad of warning lights at me.

I think I stared off into space, numb, for what was probably a long time. Long enough for the shock to wear off a bit and the pain to come.

I realized my nose was bleeding. Instinctively, I reached to touch it and then squealed in pain. Was that the crunch I heard? As I became more aware of my surroundings, I had suddenly felt extremely claustrophobic. With the airbag deployed and the seatbelt locked, I felt a sense of panic. I couldn’t unbuckle it, it was stuck. I squirmed around uselessly for a bit -- visions of being trapped there forever, in pain with the lights and car pinging, flashed through my mind. It took me a moment, but I did eventually remember that I had my utility knife in the center console. I sawed through the seatbelt with shaking hands.

I had never been in an accident before, so in my disoriented state I tried to remember what to do. I wasn’t supposed to get out on the driver’s side into oncoming traffic, and something else? Oh, the hazards. I turned those on. I would’ve expected the extra light to comfort me but the flash, flash, flash, that illuminated the trees and road ahead a pale amber, and red behind me just made everything seem even more eerie. This is not a rural highway by any means – there’s only a stretch of a few miles without any streetlights, or businesses. Of course, that short stretch is where I had ended up. 

I knew I needed to call 911, and probably needed to get out of the car. Having a plan of action comforted me and I painfully wriggled around the airbags, over the center console, panting as I crawled over and through. I had vaguely wondered why the passengers’ side was deployed – my car automatically turns it off when there isn’t anyone there. I was fairly out of it -- when I blinked I don’t think both eyes opened and closed at the same time. Was that blood on the passenger-side airbag, too? I wondered if it had come from me and my hands as I tried to squeeze through.

I slid, and then semi-fell out the door on the passenger’s side when I opened it, luckily catching myself with my hands before my face hit the asphalt. The door had been partially open already, so I had unknowingly put more of my weight into the action than necessary.

I hadn't had anyone in the car with me. Did I? No. Maybe? 

Once I was outside, something felt very wrong. I had goosebumps – the temperature felt 30 degrees cooler than it had when I left my parents’ house. I may have imagined it, but I thought I heard whispers and moans coming from just beyond the tree line. The air had an awful smell and taste to it. When I had first climbed out of the car I had breathed through my mouth, it left an oily residue and rotten taste on my tongue. I felt like there were eyes just beyond the trees, watching me. I was so confused but I was aware enough to know my mind was dulled. It made me feel vulnerable.

Seeing that the area was deserted, I squeezed back into the driver’s seat, locked the doors and sobbed for a moment. Instead of trapped, I now felt safe wedged in the tight space after seeing the alternative. I even considered trying to drive away, but talked myself out of it. 

As my head cleared up I remembered – the eyes! Oh. Oh no. I had hit something. I wondered what I’d do if it was still alive but injured. I hoped it wasn’t in pain, because there was nothing I could do to help it. I also hoped it wouldn’t lash out at me in its injured state. I figured I needed to go out and look but another part of me was bargaining with myself – please, please don’t make me go back out there. The thought had terrified me at the time.

I eventually got my bearings, slowly got back out, focused on not breathing through my mouth. The road was deserted – I couldn’t see any lights or even hear another car. I noticed for the first time that my hazards and headlights didn’t illuminate that much into the distance for some reason, almost like we were in a dense fog. 

I felt like I might as well have been alone in the world at that moment. 

I slowly, cautiously, walked around to the front of my car, my arm and sleeve over my nose and mouth but still gagging on the air. To my confusion but also relief, there wasn’t anything there. Maybe the animal was fine, and it just went back into the woods? It was fine, I’d be fine. Right?

I looked at the nearly inverted front end of my car, there was nothing – no fur, no blood. What did I hit, then? In a flash of the lights, I noticed there was some dark liquid in front of my car. I shined my phone flashlight on it, it didn’t look like blood, it was too dark. Was it oil, I had wondered? With my phone light, I saw that whatever it was continued on in little droplets with occasional smears, like whatever the liquid had come from, it had been moving around. So probably not oil... I hesitated, but eventually curiosity won out and I followed the trail to the driver’s side door, many of the drops converged there. Okay, so the source had stopped there for a bit. From there, the trail of liquid led around the back of the car – I paused, thought I heard something. 

After a few seconds of silence, I decided to continue following the trail of liquid to the passenger side door. The source seemed to have stopped outside of the passenger’s side for a while – it had nearly formed a shallow puddle. I also noticed black smears on the passenger side door handle. From there the trail finally led off into the grass where I couldn’t distinguish it anymore in the dark.

When I had briefly shone my light at that small strip of grass between me and the woods, my phone light reflected on something pale, where the asphalt met the grass. I squinted – saw it was the sole of a shoe. I looked at my own feet. I had both shoes on. I heard what sounded like branches cracking.

In that moment, I remembered the moaning I had heard earlier from just beyond the trees.

Something felt very, very wrong. My mind was still reeling and trying to put the pieces together but something about the scene as a whole spoke to me on a primal level. I decided I needed to get back in the car immediately and lock the doors. I realized in my confusion that I had forgotten to call for help. I called 911.

I climbed in my backseat and curled into the fetal position. I’m so glad I had locked the doors.

Just when I had started to calm down, I could hear footsteps break the silence. I at first thought ‘wow, the police got here fast’, and then realized I didn’t hear or see sirens. I tried to wedge my body down towards the floorboards. I heard something attempt to open the door handle once, and then several times in quick succession. I squeezed my eyes shut. That’s when I heard the sirens. The air felt normal again by the time they helped me out of the car.

The next thing I remember was when a mix of sunlight and fluorescent lights hit my eyes. I was in the hospital, my dad on one side and my friend Clara’s sister Violet on the other. I felt no pain whatsoever – the meds were fantastic.

My dad, who looked very disheveled, jumped up, choked back a sob , “Oh god, Em. Your mom went to get some food, I’m going to tell her you’re awake.” He leaned towards me, paused “Can I hug her?”, he asked a passing nurse. She waived him over closer to her, they spoke in hushed tones, occasionally taking a moment to look over at me.

“Hey Vi, where’s Clara?” I asked, my voice hoarse from non-use.

Violet put her hand on mine, smiled sadly. 

I’m still not sure what I hit. It wasn’t a tree, I was still on the road, and there’s no evidence it was another car. I told them I saw eyes seconds before the crash, but I was told there was no evidence of any animal involved either. The officers I talked to exchanged a meaningful glance when I mentioned the eyes, black liquid, and whispers I thought I had heard, but didn’t comment. 

They told me that stretch of the highway was always ‘closed for construction’ between 12 and 1 AM, asked why I had driven around the barriers. We found out later that someone had actually forgotten to block off the entrance I had used that morning.

They had to tell me a few times before it clicked, that Clara had been in the car with me. At first, I kept insisting I had been alone – maybe because I couldn’t handle the thought of the truth? But it’s coming back now. I have nightmares sometimes where I’m in the car, in a haze. She clutches at my arm and shouts my name, until she’s pulled away and dragged off screaming into the darkness. So much screaming... When I finally was approved to go back to our dorm, I was greeted by her empty bed, pictures of us, her family, plastered the walls. It hurts, remembering. 

They found the shoe, and yes, it was hers. And…they found her, too. Sort of.

At first I think they suspected me, since I was the only other person there at the time. I don’t think Clara’s sister or my parents did, but the police had asked me a lot of questions, some of which felt very pointed. Maybe they just had to rule me out, but I learned some additional details purely based on the questions they asked me: like that they found drag marks from the grassy shoulder leading into the woods.

I wish they hadn’t shown me the pictures, though.

Now, whenever I look at her pictures on the wall, pictures of the scene flash into my mind, too.

One of her and her family smiling in Galveston – the shoe by the side of the road. The two of us at Disney Land together – drag marks leading into the trees. A picture of her, beaming, as our high school valedictorian – human teeth, arranged in a circle with a toothless jawbone in the middle.

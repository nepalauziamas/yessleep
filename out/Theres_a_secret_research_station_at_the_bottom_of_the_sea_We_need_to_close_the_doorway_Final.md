**DAY FOUR**

It must have been past midnight, but I was still wide awake, slumped against the door of the sick bay. We had approximately 12 hours left before the Nereus’s secondary systems failed. Ben had left to find Alexandra; meanwhile, Ellen had escaped from the kitchen floor while our attention was focused on transporting Rose to the sick bay. 

Rose’s vital signs were stable, her breathing regular, and I’d determined to the best of my ability that she hadn’t done any additional damage to herself other than the evisceration. In the meantime, I’d wrapped her intestine with cling wrap and sedated her with ketamine. But that was just a stopgap. We still needed to get Rose out of here and to a surgeon. 

Alexandra marched down the hallway, Ben trailing behind her, and I straightened up from the sick bay door. At first, I was relieved to see her, but as she approached us, I noticed the faint vertical red lines down her face, as though she’d been clawing at her own eyes. She raised an eyebrow at my scrutiny. “Is there a problem, Dr. Weir?”

I gave myself a mental shake. “We need to evacuate Rose immediately. She’s not going to make it for much longer. Is there any other way we can communicate with mission control or the Proteus? I mean, won’t they notice when we stop replying to their messages?”

“Standard protocol is to wait 48 hours for a response before sending a submersible,” Ben said impatiently. “By then, it’ll be too late for us. And since you destroyed all of *our* submersibles...”

I glared at him, momentarily speechless. “I didn’t destroy them!” But was that true? I racked my brains, thinking back to when I’d first stepped into the docking station. The submersibles had been intact then. After that though...I’d hallucinated the rust coming to life and opened my eyes to find everything irreparably broken. 

Alexandra replied, “It doesn’t matter who destroyed what. Either way, they’re gone. Is there any other way off this station?”

Ben paused. With obvious reluctance, he said, “Well, there's the ADS2001. But they haven’t been thoroughly tested at this depth, and the Proteus is 2,000 meters above us. There’s no guarantee we would make it.” He saw my look of confusion and added, “Atmospheric diving suits. They have self-contained life support systems and thrusters.”

“Perfect,” Alexandra said crisply. She drew her gun and shot Ben. I screamed as he fell over, clutching at his shoulder. Alexandra stepped forward to shoot him again, and I rushed her, shoving her arm aside. The bullet went over Ben’s head, but she slammed the butt of the gun into my jaw. 

I fell back, stunned. “What the hell is wrong with you?” I shouted, unable to even hear my own voice; the sound of the gun going off had temporarily deafened me. But as soon as I asked the question, I realized that I already knew the answer. “You’ve been affected by something from that other world. Whatever’s on the station with us.”

She shook her head. “No, Dr. Weir. My orders from mission control were clear: destroy the submersibles and ensure that no one from this station reaches the surface.”

Ben spoke up from where he was still lying on the ground. “They’re just going to let us die?”

“Yes. And if you attempt to leave, I’ll shoot you.”

I had to keep her talking and distracted. She wouldn’t be able to hold the gun on both of us forever, and I’d take my chance as soon as she lowered it. “Why does the U.S. government want to shut the station down *now* of all times?” I asked. “What’s changed?” 

“Why does it matter to you, Dr. Weir? Either way, your fate remains the same.”

“I’m asking this as a favor. Consider it my dying wish. The least you can do before you kill us is to tell us why we have to die.” She frowned, mulling this over. I’d always thought that my life would flash before my eyes right before I died, but the terror I felt right now was too great for that. I’d never been so acutely aware of my heart pounding my chest, knowing that its beats were numbered. The muzzle of her gun seemed to widen the longer I stared at it. 

After a few minutes, Alexandra sighed. “Fine. The lab coats think that the doorway below us is tied to our perception of it, and that Katie cracked the door open somehow. Something slipped through. They say that our entire station, and everyone on it, is infected.” She started walking towards me again. 

“What do you mean it’s tied to our perception? How will they close the door?” A passing thought struck me, something Ben had said about Katie--but it vanished before I could catch hold of it. 

Alexandra shrugged and aimed the gun at me. I closed my eyes--and immediately opened them as a mindless scream rang through the air. Unnoticed by any of us, Ellen had been walking down one of the hallways. She leapt onto Alexandra’s back, clawing and biting at her, her eyes as blank and shiny as a wind-up doll. 

I sprinted over to Ben and helped him up. “We need to get out of here!” He nodded, but tried to stagger off in the opposite direction. I pulled him back. I had no idea if he could hear me or not--my left ear was gradually picking sounds back up again, but my right ear remained ominously silent. “I’m not leaving Rose behind!” I yelled, pointing back at the sick bay. 

We stumbled towards it, Ben leaning heavily on me for support. Behind me, someone shrieked in agony, and I turned around just in time to see Ellen gnawing on Alexandra’s left eye, her teeth sunk into Alexandra’s flesh. Alexandra shrieked again and flipped Ellen over, slammed her head against the ground. She did this over and over again, like a woman possessed, long past when Ellen had already gone limp, until the back of her skull caved in. 

I yanked Ben into the sick bay with one giant heave and slammed the door shut, knowing that it wouldn’t be enough. We had no way to lock the door and nothing to barricade it with. More to the point, we’d have to leave the sick bay eventually to find the ADS. All Alexandra had to do was keep us here for the next thirty or so hours, and her work would be done. 

“Where’s Rose?” Ben panted, and I turned around with a surge of horror to see the exam bed empty. Blood stained the sheets, more blood than anyone could have survived losing. Rose had ripped out the IV lines and left, despite the ketamine in her system that should have made that impossible. I never should’ve left her alone in here, not even for one minute. A familiar, all-encompassing guilt overwhelmed me. I briefly covered my face before forcing myself to move on. I had another patient in front of me right now.  

“Let me have a look at that,” I said to Ben, and gave his shoulder a cursory examination. He’d been lucky; the bullet hadn’t gone anywhere near his collarbone. I pulled out the haemostatic gauze from the emergency first aid kit and started plugging it into his wound. 

As I worked, I kept one eye on the door, half-expecting Alexandra to burst through it at any second. But the Nereus remained ominously silent, and it was too easy to imagine her lurking outside the door, gun held at the ready. How many rounds did she have left? I tapped Ben’s uninjured shoulder and gestured at the sling. “You’re all done.”

“Good. The ADS2001s are located next to the docking--”

“We can’t go there yet. We need to find out what Katie knew.”

Ben jerked around in surprise. “What are you talking about? What we *need* is to get to the ADS as soon as possible before Alexandra destroys them or the entire station shuts down.”

“Alexandra said that Katie was the one who opened the door,” I said, continuing even as he shook his head. “We need to find out if there’s a way for us to *close* the door. You remember what Alexandra said--that mission control thinks we’re all infected.”

“Alexandra’s gone crazy. I doubt she actually heard anything from mission control.”

“Ben. Please. I’m doing this with or without you, but I need your help. I don’t even know where Katie worked in the station. And don’t you want to know what Katie meant? How she opened the door, how all of this happened?” I stared at him pleadingly, willing him to say yes.

Minutes crawled by as he thought it over, and I held my breath. I meant what I’d said: if I had to do this alone, I would. But I had no doubt that it would be much easier with Ben’s help. Finally, he blew out an exasperated sigh and said, “Half an hour. Tops. That’s all the amount of time I’m willing to give you. And then I *am* going to leave without you, and good luck figuring out how the ADS works on your own.”

“Half an hour is more than enough,” I said, with more confidence than I felt. Before I could say anything else, Alexandra screamed wordlessly from outside the sick bay. We exchanged a startled glance, but her screams went on and on without pausing for breath, sharp as a knife’s edge. My skin crawled with anticipatory dread. Just when I thought that I’d go mad if I had to listen to them any longer, they stopped.

The silence spun out like shattered glass. 

We cautiously poked our heads out from the sick bay. The hallways were empty; Alexandra had vanished. I had no idea what could have caused her to scream like that, and I didn't want to find out. I turned to Ben and hissed, “Which way?”

He gestured towards the curved ramp that led to the second floor. We hurried up it and into the maze of hallways. I suspected that even if I managed to escape from the Nereus, I’d still see these hallways in my dreams. I’d be trapped inside of them, knowing that something was chasing me and would catch up soon... 

Ben stopped us at a pod that opened onto a small laboratory. Three rows of counters stretched across the room, dozens of computer monitors and scientific instruments on them. Underneath the counters were cabinets with black knobs. Ben headed straight towards the furthest cabinet and started digging through it. “Katie kept everything related to her research here,” he said. “Come on, help me look through it.”

I handed him various stacks of papers and uncovered a composition book at the bottom of the cabinet, wedged in the back. I wrenched it out and started rifling through the pages, sending a silent apology to Katie. This had obviously been a personal journal of sorts. Some entries expressed her excitement about the Nereus, while others discussed her family and friends.

But the later entries became increasingly incoherent and fragmentary. She’d sometimes left sentences or words half-written across the page, and the sentences she did manage to complete were utterly nonsensical, similar to the message we’d seen earlier next to the kitchen pod (*i see you leave me alone*). Near the end, she’d pressed her pen with such force that it’d ripped straight through the paper:

*ring around the rosie it’s everywhere on the station* 

*pocket full of dead leave me alone*

*STOP THINKING ABOUT THE STONES you can’t think or else they’ll* 

*they’ll get insi e y u head and*

She’d made drawing after drawing of the doorway below us, scribbles of five stones in a loose circle. Underneath the very last drawing, she’d written in a desperate, unhinged scrawl, *only THREE stones on the other side NOT FIVE!!!* 

As soon as I read the words, the image sprung into my mind, vivid and fully-formed: the same circle of five stones below us, only one of them had disappeared, eroded into dust over the weight of millennia. Another one was a broken heap. With those two gone, there were huge, inviting gaps in the circle. And although the other three stones currently remained upright, cracks spiderwebbed through the bases of two of them; they would fall soon as well. Unexpected understanding struck me like a lightning bolt. If that happened, just one stone wouldn’t be enough to hold the door shut; that alternate dimension would come spilling through to ours, like a pot of ink upended onto a piece of paper, staining the whole thing black. 

The ground rumbled underneath our feet as the doorway *shook*. It sent shockwaves through the water and the Nereus. Ben yelped and toppled over, while I grabbed for the edge of the counter to steady myself. The earthquake only lasted for a handful of seconds, but it left us both trembling and pale. “She was studying the samples,” Ben gasped out. “They always told us that the ROV disappeared and never came back, but...” 

“Samples of what?”

“Samples taken from the other dimension. It says so in her lab reports. Let’s get out of here.” He shakily got to his feet and we rushed out of the lab. It was utterly insane, something I had no idea how to express to Ben--but I knew, on a bone-deep level that defied rational explanation, that my split-second mental image of the doorway as *three* stones instead of *five* had caused the earthquake--that I’d somehow shaken the stability of the doorway. Even worse, for that infinitesimal fraction of a second, I’d sensed that something vaguely serpentine waited on the other side of the doorway, coiled up against it: a vast, incomprehensible abomination that was inexorably forcing the door open.

An ear-splitting siren blared throughout the station, the same one we’d heard yesterday. The lights flickered and began to shut off in the pods, one by one. “What the hell is happening?” I yelled to Ben. 

“Alexandra! She must have done something to the secondary systems!”

We flew through the hallways. A stitch burned in my side, and my throat still hurt from Ellen’s attack; I wanted more than anything to sit down, but that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon, not if I wanted to stay alive. Every minute we took to navigate through another intersection of hallways seemed to last a year. Finally, we reached the ramp that led down to the first floor. 

We sprinted down it and into the submersible docking station. Ben led me straight to a door that I’d walked past a dozen times already without ever noticing. The pod was filled with a mess of machinery. I couldn’t even pretend to understand their purpose, but one thing was clear: those were the atmospheric diving suits, hanging from the ceiling. Two of them. 

They resembled bulkier versions of spacesuits, but shiny silver and with black bands going down the limbs. Ben tapped a series of buttons into the keypad next to them, and unseen machinery above us whirred to life, slowly moving the ADS towards the submersible docking station. We ran back there to wait for them, Ben pacing around in tight circles. 

“How do the suits work?” I asked. I had to yell to be heard over the siren. 

“You should be able to walk around in them normally, while we’re on dry land. Once you go into the water, you’ve got to flip a switch on your arm to activate the thrusters. Foot pedals inside the suit will allow you to move. You’ve also got manipulators at the end of each arm so you can grab objects. We’ll put on the legs first, then the top half. The vacuum pump will create a hydraulic seal.”

The suits arrived at the docking station and we clambered onto the raised platforms to put them on. Stepping into the suit felt like stepping into a coffin. It was difficult to manipulate, and it didn’t help that I barely knew how it worked. Ahead of me, Ben stepped over to the airlock and slammed a fist down on the button to open it. I allowed myself to feel a surge of cautious relief: against all odds, we were leaving the Nereus. 

“You can’t leave.” I turned around and screamed. The tottering figure that stood in the doorway of the pod only somewhat resembled the woman Alexandra had been. At first glance, her body seemed to have turned into scraps of metal subsumed by rust. She turned a face towards me that was a glowing golden blur. As she walked towards us, a wave of rust raced out from her feet. 

This had to be what Alexandra had meant when she’d said that we were all infected, all of us. Because that couldn’t be rust. It *wasn’t*. Ordinary rust didn’t writhe like that, alive and aware, constantly swirling together to form patterns before breaking apart. It didn’t *breathe*. I backed away, but the weight of the suit hampered my movements; every step backwards took an immense amount of effort. And at the back of my mind, a panicked voice yammered, *It’s been on the station this entire time, you’ve even TOUCHED it, you’ve been BREATHING IT IN...*

Abruptly, the not-rust formed thick bulging masses across her entire body; the one on her upper thigh transformed into a familiar face: Katie’s. It happened again, and again, until the faces of the dead were staring at me from Alexandra’s body. I saw a man’s face, one I didn’t recognize, and remembered Dr. Miller’s inexplicable departure from the Nereus. He hadn’t left at all. The not-rust was constantly in motion, and their faces seemed to laugh, or scream, or both at once. I realized with numb horror that everyone who’d died on the Nereus so far had achieved a hellish kind of immortality. 

When Alexandra spoke again, it was the voice of the Nereus as it creaked and groaned under the immense pressure of the ocean depths. “You don’t want to leave.” Each word sliced through the noise of the siren clearly. 

It was true: a tiny part of me *wanted* to stay. I wanted this nightmare to end. And maybe that same tiny part of me wanted to help open the doorway below us, to go through it...and to let the not-rust take over me. It was already inside of me, and the process would be simple. Quick. Painless. Around us, the Nereus trembled. It was transforming where the not-rust touched it, turning into a structure made from alien flesh and bone. Its “walls” shivered, covered with peeling skin and glowing red-orange veins. The ground squelched underneath me, soft and spongy. My feet stuck to it with every step. The entire station breathed and pulsed with unspeakable life.

What ultimately cut through my longing was the memory of Alexandra’s screams. How they’d turned into hoarse barks near the end. It wouldn’t be painless at all. I backed up, until I was next to a stack of unopened crates, and Alexandra lurched towards me with a frightening burst of speed. She raised her arms to embrace me. Summoning every last scrap of strength, I grabbed onto the closest crate and swung it at her. 

She screamed in baffled rage, and I ran for the airlock, knowing that I was literally running for my life. Nothing could have prepared me for the fear that ate through me like acid, and the wild exhilaration that accompanied that fear, in defiance of all common sense. I’d only given myself a few seconds’ head start, but it turned out that a few seconds was all I needed. Every muscle straining with effort, I threw myself into the airlock. Ben slammed the door shut, already keying in the sequence to open the second door that led out directly into the sea.  

We left the Nereus. 

And not a moment too soon. The lights from the Nereus shut off all at once, the ever-present hum of the generators dying into silence. I had one split second to revel in our freedom before I started to sink. The darkness around me was impenetrable. I thought of what waited below in the trench and screamed. 

LED lights blinded me and the radio in my suit crackled to life. Ben said, directly into my ear, “Use your foot pedals! Pushing down on your right toes will move you forward, and the heel will move you backwards. Pushing down on the left toes will move you down, while the heel moves you up.”

Right. I had foot pedals. I flipped the switch to activate the thrusters and pressed down on the left foot pedal gingerly. The ADS took me upwards at an odd angle, and I crashed into the side of the Nereus and rebounded. When I stopped pushing on the pedal, I immediately sank again. At least the suit was much easier to move in the water. “How do you have lights?” An unpleasant thought struck me. “And how much oxygen do we have?”

“The LED lights are located on your arms, and the ADS2001 has two separate oxygen systems with a total capacity of 25 hours of life support. The air inside of the suit is filtered and recirculated by carbon dioxide scrubbers.”

After a few fumbling moments, I managed to turn the LED lights on and breathed a sigh of relief. The darkness of the abyssal zone still pressed down around me, but the lights illuminated my immediate surroundings. That was good enough for me. Whereas I struggled with every movement, Ben used his suit without any difficulty. He pointed at something barely perceptible in the distance. “We need to follow the umbilical from the Nereus to the Proteus.”

\*\*\*\*

Our pace was hampered by my incompetence with the suit, and I tried not to dwell on the fact that it seemed like I’d need every last one of those 25 hours of life support. Despite Ben’s concern, the suits were holding up well, at least as far as I could tell. We followed the umbilical, which was comprised of hoses that supplied air from compressors, oxygen from storage flasks, and power lines from the generators. 

Hours passed. Ben and I didn’t talk much, both of us lost in thought. Now that we were out of immediate danger, the events of the past few days played through my mind on a grisly loop. I thought of Katie, Rose, Jon, Ellen, and Alexandra, and of all the ways they’d either murdered one another or themselves. I hadn’t been able to save anyone. Most of all, I thought of all the times I’d touched the not-rust, blissfully ignorant of what it actually was. Was it inside of me right now, a seed of infection waiting to flower? And if so, what did that mean for the rest of my life? Would the Navy quarantine us or leave us to die?

I’d been mindlessly following the umbilical, all my attention turned inwards, so our arrival at Proteus caught me by complete surprise. It was a simple one-story structure in the shape of a long tube, not unlike the first floor of the Nereus. But there were no pods or hallways protruding from it, and it was half the size. Lights shone down on us cheerily, and I paused, uncertain. Going inside the Proteus meant telling everyone what had happened on our station. It meant everyone scrutinizing my decisions and actions, and living with the consequences of them. 

Ben, however, didn’t share my hesitation. He maneuvered himself up to the airlock and started punching in the sequence to open it. I stared at him, amazed. “How do you know the codes to open the Proteus’s airlock?”

“We might have been assigned to the Nereus, but scientists often rotate between the two stations. My stint at the Proteus ended only a week ago. I’m surprised they didn’t change the codes yet.”

A loud hiss sounded as the lights around the airlock blinked and the door opened. I clumsily followed Ben inside, surrealness descending over me. It didn’t seem possible that we’d left the Nereus and made it to the Proteus. They’d be able to get into contact with mission control--they’d have working submersibles. In less than a day, we’d be getting the hell out of here. I took off the suit, sighing in relief as its heavy weight disappeared. I’d definitely strained my back while running to the Nereus’s airlock. 

Ben began to slide open the door that led to the main compartment of the Proteus. “Why hasn’t anyone greeted us yet? They should’ve noticed the airlock opening from the outside.”

Before I could think of an answer, the door slid open and provided one for us.

Everyone on the Proteus was dead. 

Corpses were scattered throughout the main compartment. They’d all died violently, either at their own hand or the hands of others. One woman had fashioned a noose out of wires and clawed at her own eyes as she died. Two others had apparently beaten each other to death, their faces so much raw meat. A man had broken a glass beaker and jammed a bouquet of shards into his own throat. Even worse, the not-rust bloomed from every square inch of the station. It swirled and shifted as I looked at it, as protean as the sea. 

There was no escape from it. 

The hiss of a door sealing shut shook me out of my stupor. I turned around--and saw Ben inside of the airlock. He didn’t have his suit on. Horror threatened to drown me, and I tried to tug the door back open. “What are you doing?” I demanded, knocking on the door to get his attention.

He turned towards me, face slack and eyes glazed, mumbling unintelligible words under his breath. I yanked at the door, pummeled it, not caring if I scraped my knuckles raw. “Get back here, Ben! Right now!” I couldn’t lose him too. 

“There’s no point, Cordelia. The doorway is opening. Can’t you see it?” He gave me a beatific smile. “Three stones. Not five.” 

And once again, the image pierced my mind. One stone was already gone, the other lying in a broken heap. Two more swayed on their foundations, huge cracks splitting them down the middle. A smoldering orange-red light, the light from an insane alien sun, began to spill out from the space within the circle. It pulsed with avid greed, twisting everything in its path. I fell to the ground, clutching my head uselessly as the Proteus shook. 

I tried to imagine five standing stones again, all five upright and whole as I’d first seen them. I might as well have tried to stop breathing. The image of the two broken stones kept intruding, and every time I pictured it in my mind’s eye it grew more solid. I somehow knew that if I didn’t stop thinking about the broken stones in that other dimension, the stones in our world would break too--their reality overwriting ours. When that happened, that unspeakable thing would break through, followed by a whole host of other abominations.  

With an effort, I wrenched my mind away from the doorway. The shaking subsided instantly. I scrambled up to my feet, running back to the airlock, hoping I wasn’t too late. But it was empty. Ben was gone. 

I was the only one left.

\*\*\*\*

An interminable amount of time passed. When I looked up, Riley was standing over me. His eyes were two bleeding holes, and maggots wormed their way out from underneath his peeling fingernails. I didn’t have the strength left to speak. He held out his hand to me in a wordless demand, and I took it. As he led me through the Proteus, I tried not to look at the corpses. Each one seemed to be glaring at me accusingly, their faces twisted in hatred. It didn’t take us long to arrive at the sick bay. 

The scalpels gleamed under the fluorescent lights. 

“No,” I told him. I backed away, shaking my head. Riley said nothing. He simply held one up, waiting. 

The night my husband killed himself, I was lying on our living room sofa, watching an old TV show. I don’t remember which one. I noticed Riley humming as he walked through the kitchen and up the stairs, and I heard the bedroom door slamming shut, but it didn’t occur to me to check on him. He seemed so much better lately, more like his old self: cracking jokes, leaving the house again. I eventually decided that I would go up and talk to him as soon as the next commercial break started. 

But a few minutes later, a gunshot echoed through our house. I raced up the stairs, taking them two at a time, my heart in my throat. The bedroom door was locked and I had to call 911 to break down the door. By the time they arrived, I already knew what we would find inside. The bullet had exited the back of Riley’s head, turning it into a blood-soaked ruin, and we found the drying remains of his brains splattered against the yellow wallpaper. I did that. I let him die...  

I took the scalpel, its cold edge biting into my hand. This was a way out of the nightmare of the past few days. More importantly, I deserved this. Riley nodded in agreement, his head moving jerkily. I raised the scalpel and set the tip against my abdomen. I’d hit the abdominal aorta and bleed out within minutes. But memories started to flood me. The first date Riley and I had had, at a board game cafe in Boston. Our fall tradition of going apple picking and getting cider donuts, and how he’d hidden my engagement ring inside the basket meant for our apples. Most of all, I remembered that wry grin of his and the way it lit up his whole face. 

Suddenly, I sensed Riley’s presence. He was here with me now. Not this pale imitation of him that the not-rust had spun out of my guilt and that still stood in front of me, waiting for me to plunge the scalpel into myself, but the Riley I’d known and loved. The Riley who’d loved me...and who’d never blamed me at all. Tears pricked the corners of my eyes. Even though I badly wanted to, I couldn’t give up now. Not when I still had work to do. It was the hardest thing I’d ever done, but I managed to uncurl my fingers one by one until the scalpel dropped to the ground with a loud clang. 

And then, I turned away and went in search of the communication panels. 

\*\*\*\*

I did find them, and they seem to still be working. So, I found a computer and wrote up my experience of the past few days. 

Alexandra said that the scientists think the doorway is somehow tied to our perception. It’s my personal theory that the things on the other side of the doorway gained a foothold in our world through Katie’s mind, after she studied the samples from their world. That was enough to wedge the door open a few inches. And because I’ve been on the Nereus, breathing in that not-rust...they’ve managed to infect my mind as well. Now that I’ve read her notes and seen the stones broken, only three of them left, I can never “unsee” them that way. And every time I think of them, it weakens the doorway some more. They’ve found a foothold through my mind too. 

If someone is reading this right now, please imagine five standing stones at the bottom of the ocean. Not three, but five. Five stones in an unbroken circle, tapered off at the top and equidistant from one another. Whole and upright. I’m not sure if that will be enough to close the door again, but we have to try. Because otherwise, our world will become an extension of theirs, an insane hellscape with three suns in the sky and a feverish, hungry light. And the worst of it is that none of us will die. 

My ADS still has twenty-two hours of oxygen left. I could try to make it up to the surface, but my current plan is to find a way to destroy both the Proteus and the Nereus, and the not-rust on both stations. I have to do it before the Navy decides to send anyone else down here who might become infected too. I’ve sent this message to everyone I know, and now I’m posting this message to everywhere I can think of, in the hopes that it will reach as many people as possible. 

I don’t think I’m going to make it back up.

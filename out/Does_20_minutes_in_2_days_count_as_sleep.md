Guys, does 20 minutes count as sleep? 


 If it does, I'm in the wrong place. I've been looking for her for hours, then I sat in my car in despair and somehow dozed off.



When they first let me out of the station, I told myself I wasn't going to go back and try to convince them to come with me, but I ended up doing it anyway. 


I begged anyone within ear shot, please just help me. 



Nothing. 



How was this happening? In a place made for those in distress and yet no one cared. 


I started crying. I may have killed someone, please, who else would come in here and confess to something like this. It fell upon deaf ears. 



This one traffic light town, they didn't care about an outsider. Whether that outsider was the murder or the murdered.



The lady at the front desk seemed sympathetic, but still encouraged me to leave before they kept me longer. She was right, they already wasted my whole night. 



A damn holding cell? A small town that had the local drunk and some other passerby in it. I lost my dignity last night when I had to use the bathroom in front of people. I know it was my Karma, I deserved it. 


I'm sitting here complaining about using the toilet in front of strangers and the weird freaky deputy who made it a point to make eye contact as I wiped.



I drove back here, trying to fight my urge to speed. The last thing I needed was to cause another tragedy. 



I'm just sitting here in my car,  losing my mind. 

What else can I do? I ran a girl over with my car and she was out there wandering this huge wooded area alone and hurt and no one was taking me seriously. 


I came out here and I've walked so much my feet are aching, I knew I deserved it- I deserved far worse. I didn't come back to the car to pity myself, but to collect myself. 



If I passed out dehydrated, if I lost my footing and knocked myself unconscious, no one would find her and I know that every second counted.



I tried to follow footprints, for what? Who was I kidding? I didn't know how to track anything or anyone. The last thing I knew anything about was nature. This was my fault. I wish I paid attention to small details or something. Maybe if I knew what shoes she was wearing, I could find their treads in the mud.



I concentrated as hard as I could to picture the legs sticking out from underneath my car. 

It was so hard to remember with my brother's girlfriend screaming at me. If she didn't distract me, the girl wouldn't have had time to run away. 



She must have been so scared. If my stupid brother's girlfriend didn't act like she didn't see anything, she could have helped me find her. 



If my stupid brother wasn't so drunk in the backseat of my car, vomiting every bit of anything that was in him all over my cloth seats, he could have helped me find her. 



I sat in the car having slept those 20 minutes, if it was even considered sleep. It reeks of vomit. I had only barely scraped it out and tossed it to the side so I could hurry back here. 



My feet are covered in mud and I am exhausted. I just want to go home, but how could I? I may never sleep again if I have this girl's death is on my hands. 



I need a plan. Does anyone know anything about tracking someone in the woods? My battery is running low and I should probably find a gas station nearby. I just don't want to leave here, I'm worried the minute I leave she'll wander by where I was.

I don’t have a lot of time to write this, quite honestly I think my life is on the line. Let’s start with the beginning so you can understand what’s going on. 

As a child I always had nightmares, it’s so normal to me that I’m desensitized from it. As a child I would fear for myself and not sleep, I would end up sleeping in school and getting in trouble. My parents would always get upset at me and ask me what’s wrong, I always told them but they just chalk it up to just me lying so I can stay up and play on my tablet. They took away my tablet and unplugged my tv but that didn’t stop me from staying up, the creature always smile a creepy smile, the smile was huge. To be honest I think the smile got bigger as my smile started to disappear. 

My nightmare turned into hallucinations. I was getting so bad, in middle school I was seeing the creature everyday and they always looked so real, if someone asked me what I see I can always explain it, a silhouette of a man a tall man with a face that can scare any child, looking at the face you can’t see any nose you can’t see any ears but you can see the eyes and mouth. There was no color in the eyes, it was pitch black, and the smile, oh the smile, it didn’t even fit the face. It was inhumanly big and the teeth were crooked. I know most won’t find it scary, but you’re not the one experiencing it! You’re not the one that has to see it every day looking at you and giving nightmares, hallucinations, and visions and I didn’t even talk about what it does!

 In nightmares they stare at you for what feels like eternity just to choke me till I wake up from lack of air or chase me till they catch me just to break my arm, and that’s just the nightmares. For hallucinations they stand anywhere where my eyes touch and stare at me with that god awful smile that sends chills down my spine oh and the visions, there the worst out of the bunch. The creature will always show me them crawling into my room after busting down the door just to choke me or stab me or ripping out my insides. There’s more but I don’t feel comfortable talking about it. 

And around this time of middle school I got a therapist, I told them everything, every detail I can say, the therapist just told me it’s paranoia and just gave me meds. After taking the meds I no longer saw the creature, as if the creature never existed. You will never understand how happy I was, I can finally sleep like a baby, I didn’t have to fear for my life! Well I thought that until two weeks ago. 

Around Tuesday in the last two weeks I had a dream. It started as any other dream it was fun, I was doing things I can never do in real life, it was fun until everything started to crumble all around me to white. The creature, the creature I haven’t seen in a year and a half. It came back, it was far at first till I blinked just to see it in front of me. The tall creature, face to face. I managed to wake up though, before it can do anything. Thoughts rushed in my head, I couldn’t even sort them out before I felt the breathing right next to my face, I turned, hoping it was a dog even if it didn’t make sense. The creature face to face. With that god forsaken smile. I know that smile didn’t scare me any more but the breathing did, because wasn’t this creature just a thing in my head? Wasn’t all fake and I was just seeing things due to stress? WHY THE HELL IS IT BREATHING?! 

Sorry, I don’t have much time. Anyways, the creature spoke, out of all my years of life, I never heard it utter a word. It told me in a quite raspy whisper that made my bones rattle. “We will be reunited soon, my love.” Maybe this was just sleep paralysis, so I tried to move to test it. I moved my arm and looked towards where the creature was. It. Was. Still. There. I wanted to cry. I was so scared, this never happened happened before, I wanted to scream for my parents but I know they would never come. The creature smile got wider, it had a low raspy chuckle and played with my hair and left out the door.

 I must have fell asleep cuz it was morning when I opened my eyes. I immediately got to work, I asked my parents if I can sleep them, they thought it was weird ofc since I’m already in high school but they allowed it. When it was morning I would train for an “intruder” and hide a knife in my room and train getting it out as fast as I can. At night I would sleep in my parents room so the creature would feel less inclined to come and attack me. I did all this in the two weeks I had till today. Today is Thursday, it’s 3:00pm. My parents are planning to leave today so they can have a little break from work but I know it’s because of me, knowing that I begged for them to take me but they said no, using the excuse of needing someone to watch the house. I gave up and just let them go. 

I’m now all alone in the house, at least I have my dog with me. Now we came full circle, if you see this please help me. I don’t really know what I’m doing and I’m still terrified. Anything helps. Thank you and bye.

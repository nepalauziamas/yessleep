I'm a 19 year old female from Missouri. When I was 11, I discovered creepypasta for the first time. I've loved horror for as long as I can remember. Especially any and all things creepypasta related. I still do but not as much. 

Also, paranormal stuff has been happening to me since I was 2. It's going on 18 years since I've experienced anything paranormal (including the slender man incidents). Including seeing the Hat Man multiple times and demonic spirits. 

To briefly mention, the first time I encountered a spirit was when I was 2, and living with my mom and grandparents. I thought it was an imaginary friend until my mom said it was a spirit of a young boy who was a slave. Along with seeing the Hat Man multiple times around my grandparents house in the farm. Along with a female and male spirit I saw in 2 of the upstairs bedrooms for a few years (still do) that refuse to leave. And a demonic entity (female I think) hanging on the ceiling wanting to get me. (FYI my mom told me these stories, I only vividly remember the male and female spirits).

This experience I've never told too many people since they're skeptical of this. I want to get off my chest and out somewhere, maybe someone had a similar experience to mine. Because if so, I want to know so I'm not alone in this, please. 

I feel like almost everyone knows about Slender man and knows who he is. Since he's become so popular since the early to mid 2000s.  

Well, one night while I was trying to sleep (I can't remember if it was a school night or not) and I was having some trouble. I felt as if I was being watched. I shrugged it off at first thinking it was my mom standing in my doorway checking on me, like a typical single momma. I should add my mom was a single parent at the time and sometimes kept a close eye on me (only child before my sister came into my life). 

But as I rolled over and looked at my door frame (this was before I always shut my door at night or in general) and my mom wasn't standing there. In place was Slender Man and 2 of his proxies. I quickly rolled over and pulled my blanket over my head hoping they wouldn't get me. I eventually fe asleep and woke up the next day and there wasn't anything there. I looked around the apartment and still couldn't find signs of him anywhere. Or that someone broke in. It just my mom and I. 

As I mentioned, only a couple people know about this experience. I want to know if what I saw really was him, or something pretending to him. Thoughts? 

Also, in my 8th grade English class, we were doing an assignment and I happened to look up. As I did, the entire room changed for a second. It was concrete with a limb hanging fronm ceiling. But it was so familiar, like it was from a past life.

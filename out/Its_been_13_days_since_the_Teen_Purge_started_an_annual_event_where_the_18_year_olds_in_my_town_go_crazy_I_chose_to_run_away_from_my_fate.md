13 days since the 2022 Teen Purge. October 1st, I had hopes and dreams and the naive thought that I would actually escape this town with a smile on my face. That I would start fresh in college, and I'd never have to think about Littlewood again. 

[Yeah…  no.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xwjvbe/every_october_1st_the_eighteen_year_olds_in_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

[I'll be escaping this town with severe PTSD and a constant feeling of dread in my gut that the world is coming to an end. And I'm the reason why.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/xwjvbe/every_october_1st_the_eighteen_year_olds_in_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) 

I'm writing this from the ruins of our old diner. This will be my last post.

…


When the bus came to an abrupt stop suddenly, I pressed my head against the window and peered out, hyper alert of my surroundings. I was seeing a large glass building which reminded me of a school, or maybe a hospital. It looked far more modern than anything in Littlewood. It hit me that this was the Halfway House we had been promised solace ever since we were kids. I vaguely remembered our class being told about the curse and quickly following that up with, “But we’ll keep you safe. Like we do every year, we send our seniors to a place of healing to prepare them for the outside world after going through such trauma where they can mend.”

When in actuality, I knew exactly what it was. The whispering in my head had revealed the Halfway House’s true meaning. Inside that building we were going to burn. We were going to fucking burn and nobody was coming to save us. Not our parents or the town. Leaning back in my chair, my gaze flicked to the front where two armed guards were beginning to escort my classmates off of the bus. I had already made my decision when I grabbed Kenji’s sleeve and yanked him under the seat in front of us. He let out a sharp gasp, almost a sound of protest.

“Bee, what are you—”

Slamming my hand over his mouth, I pressed myself into a ball, pulling him further under the seat. The thud, thud, thud, of the guards' boots sent slithers of fear creeping up and down my spine. 

They passed us. I could hear their breaths, their muttering to each other. The guards already knew our game. I sensed them checking under each seat—which motivated me to shuffle myself further under until I couldn’t breathe. Kenji didn’t move, his breaths sharp and heavy into the flesh of my palm. After a moment which seemed to go on forever, thudding boots retreated back towards the front of the bus. I squeezed my eyes shut when the engines started up once again. Gripping Kenji for dear life, I settled on taking deep breaths. We were going to get out, I thought. We were going to escape.

“Can you get off me?" Kenji tried to squirm from my grip, but I tightened my hold on him. 

“Shh.” I said under my breath. “Don’t make a sound, okay?”

Once the bus started to move, keeping a firm grip on Kenji’s sleeve, I pulled us from our hiding place and lifted my head, scanning for somewhere better. The back was our best bet. When I started towards it, dragging Kenji with me, however, I spotted two familiar faces already in hiding. Jonas and Mira. Kenji let out a low grumble, and part of me couldn't belive he was still salty about Jonas in this situation. 

Without speaking, we joined them, with Jonas shuffling back so I could join him, pulling a reluctant Kenji with me. It was an uncomfortable squeeze but we were safe. I allowed myself to breathe when the bus fell into a steady drive. But I didn’t have time to relax. I was considering asking Jonas in low whispers why he had chosen to hide, when once again the bus came to a jolting stop. “Forty six?” The bus driver all but squeaked from the front. 

“What are you talking about?”

Shit. Shooting the other’s a panicked look, I weighed our options. Four against one. 

We could easily get past him.

“No. No, we did a sweep of the bus! There’s nobody on here."

Jonas twisted around, shooting me a questioning look.

What the fuck is wrong with him? He mouthed.

I pressed my index over my lips in response. 

The bus driver’s voice was eerily shaky. I could hear every tremble in his tone. “Check? Yes! Uh, yes, I’ll check now. Don’t worry, alright? There’s no more kids on this bus.”

When the driver started down the aisle in a bumbling stumble and ducking under each seat,  I attempted to hide. I mean there was nowhere to hide, though I at least tried to shove myself uncomfortably further under the damn seat until we were squashed like sardines. “Hey!” The driver’s steps quickened towards us and I felt my body catapult into fight or flight. “What are you kids still doing here?” When I lifted  my head to meet his eyes, I expected anger. There was no anger, however. I was seeing frustration and fear, trickles of pain blooming in wide cartoon-like eyes. The guy was keeping his distance from us, I noticed. Like we were teeming with the plague. It was a curse, not a contagious virus.

"What do we do?" Jonas murmured. 

"We stay here." I hissed back. 

"But he's looking directly at us." 

Before I could stop him, Jonas was awkwardly dislodging himself from the gap underneath the seats. He jumped to his feet and raised his arms in mocking surrender. His smile was bright, but there was an underlying darkness in his eyes, and I had no doubt he wouldn’t resort to violence. “Yeah, I’m not a fan of the whole half-way house thing,” he said. “I’d rather just ride back into town and go and see my pops.” His lip curled. “I need to see if he’s okay. I need to check if he had a break in."

“No.” The driver’s eyes filled with tears. “No…” he shook his head rapidly, his arms trembling at his sides. “You're not. ”

"What, so I get possessed by the dead souls of my ancestors and now I don't have basic human rights?" Jonas rolled his eyes with a scoff. "You're legally inclined to let me go. I don't want to go to some weird halfway house and pretend I didn't gut my best friend's mother, alright? I'm going home, asshole."

The driver didn't move. "I'm telling you to… to stay back." He moaned. "Please. I have a wife. I have a wife and two children." 

A look of hurt sparked in the boy's eyes, and his lip curled. “The curse is over, Jackass. I'm not going to kill you." Jonas cocked his head. "Are you…crying?" 

I chose to stand at that point. Kenji followed hesitantly. The driver stiffened, backing away. “I said stay back!" He hissed out. “Do you hear me?” His shaky hand went into his jacket, his eyes squeezing shut like he was expecting something. Pulling out a phone, the man's fingers nervously tapped the screen. He didn't take his eyes off us. “I’m taking you kids back to the Halfway House, alright?"

He nodded at us like we would agree if he looked as pathetic as possible. And he did. The guy looked like he was ready to drop to his knees and beg. “Just… stay there.” 

I caught the exact moment he dropped the notion of an authority figure. His lips twisted when Jonas ignored his instructions and took a casual step towards him. If this guy had a gun, I knew he would use it. Instead, he stumbled back with a cry. “Don’t fucking move! I mean it!”

Jonas smirked. “Like this?” Another step.

This time, the man let out a shriek.

“Jonas.” Kenji said. “Dude, stop. You're scaring him."

"Scaring him? What's to be scared of?"

"I don't know," Kenji whispered, "but don't get too close, okay? He looks freaked."

“Why?” Jonas twisted around to look at him. “This guy’s got fucking problems.”

I caught a glimmer of that maniacal glitter left over from overnight. “Let me guess,” Jonas laughed. “Do you see dead people?” In three strides, he was face to face with the guy. Nose to nose. The driver was petrified to the spot, like Jonas was inhuman. "You look like you're about to shit yourself over a bunch of teenagers, my guy. Kind of pathetic, don't you think?"

"I…" The man's bottom lip trembled. His breaths were heavy, his mouth twisting and turning and trying to speak. I would have felt sorry for him, if it wasn't for him being responsible for bringing my class to the slaughter. He couldn't even get words out, wide eyes pinpointed on Jonas and Kenji like they were ghosts. 

Something was building in my head, a pressure harsh enough to make my nose bleed. I found myself staring out of the window. I had initially caught the movement of a lamppost swaying back and forth. But there was no wind. When I squinted, I noticed more things which didn't make sense; a patch of flowers which had been planted outside the Halfway House were… drooping. No, not just drooping. They were blackening, rotting away into their soil, petals being whisked into the air  and coming apart. 

It was 10:30 in the morning, and the sky was darkening. 

Kenji started forwards and grabbed Jonas’s wrist, and with the two of them so close, the man let out a childish whine which only confused Jonas further. Outside, a tree I was so sure had been standing tall and proud, crashed onto the ground suddenly, the force of the impact rattling the bus. I fought to hold on. The pressure was building in my brain, and suddenly I couldn’t… I couldn’t breathe. “Hey!” Jonas yelled in the driver's frozen face. “What did I say, huh? The curse is over! You don’t have to be scared of us anymore, so how about you—”

Bubble-gum.

It sounded like bursting bubble-gum.

I didn’t hear the latter half of what he’d said because the bus windows were suddenly bright red, dripping red. The floor was red, the seats, and the ceiling. Jonas was red, and I could feel splatters of it on my cheeks and speckled on my chin. The others had gotten the worst of it, but it was still painting me. The red was warm and wet, like I had bathed in it. It was at my feet, pooling and spilling and spattering every colour from existence. I felt like I was back in on the school corridor being suffocated by a wet rag pressed over my mouth, horrifying images projecting into my hand from the fumes. But these weren't delusions. This was real. It was happening. 

There was a dizzying moment when I thought it was raining blood before my brain found reality and I blinked at the spot where the driver had stood in front of us—and it began to dawn on me. I hadn’t been looking at the man when he popped out of existence. I was watching the leaves on the trees outside start to brown and then blacken into nothing. Like there was an invisible force decaying everything in its path. Jonas, who looked like he was starring in Cannibal Holocaust, twisted around to face me with wide, almost unseeing eyes. He looked like he might say something before the bus shook, and I forced myself to move, to find the window. 

Outside, the ground had started to crack apart, zigzagging raptures spreading like fire across the sidewalk. Kenji grabbed my arm and pulled me off the bus, Jonas diving off first, Mira on his heel. The world was crumbling around us, I realised. I could see it in flocks of birds flying across the sky in a panic. When we found solid ground, Jonas started hyperventilating. I was half listening to him mutter obscenities to himself, eyeing the growing sinkhole eating up everything in front of us. A woman jumped into her car and attempted to drive straight ahead before another tree collapsed, crushing her car. “This is the curse.” Jonas said shakily.

The four of us teetered on a safe piece of sidewalk.

“It’s got to be, right? But why would they still be mad?"

Mira wasn’t speaking. I think she was frozen. Traumatised. I could barely see her through the red.

“Nope.” Kenji murmured. He swiped blood from his eyes with his sleeve. “It’s because we’re refusing to save the world.”

“What?” Jonas spluttered.

The ground started to split in front of me and I staggered back, my stomach galloping into my throat.

“He’s brainwashed.” I found myself gritting out. “Kenji’s convinced we’re saving the world.”

“Like… like The Avengers?” Jonas grabbed his arm with a laugh. “Dude, did you hit your head?”

“No.”

“Then what are you talking about?”

“Didn’t I make it clear I didn’t want to talk to you?”

“Well, you might as well! Since the fuckin’ world is ending!” He paused. "If this about me and Wendy--" 

"Is this really the time?!"

"Yes! I swing both ways, man. It's 2022. So take that as you will."

Kenji laughed. "You're telling me this now?!" 

“Stop.” Mira cut in, her cry breaking into a sob. “Just shut up. Shut up! I can't think!"

Their back and forth was barely a whisper in the back of my mind while I watched chaos unfold in front of me. Have you ever heard a human being explode?

It kind of sounds like bubble gum bursting.

I glimpsed a running man hand in hand with a little kid before both of them went “Poof!” against the store window, painting it in a whole new colour. 

Like a domino effect, the town's people started rupturing like the ground beneath us. I was staring at an old woman struggling to hobble through a panicking crowd when the mayor announced himself via megaphone across a particularly large crack in splintered concrete. Armed guards surrounded him and I wondered if whatever this was would spare him. “Stay exactly where you are!”

“Do you understand me? Do not move!”

When they risked coming closer, part of me revelled in seeing fear prickle in their eyes. Behind the mayor, was our principal. His face beet red. The guy was seething. “Can you kids understand what you have done?”

Uh, yeah.

I think we had accidentally caused the death of Littlewood.

I didn’t say that, though. I wanted answers and Kenji and Jonas seemed in their own world, watching our town crumble around us. “The curse.” I said shakily when they were close enough to hear us. The bookshop I’d frequented my whole life started to crumble behind me, windows splintering with the force of the quake. But It barely fazed me. Neither did the little girl screaming for her exploding mother showering her in scarlet. “Who really started it?”

The mayor dropped his megaphone. “If I tell you, will you hand yourselves over?” 

Even his voice was shaking.

I nodded. “Of course.”

His lips twisted. “No fighting? No more questions?”

“Sure.” I said, gesturing to the world around us. “You should hurry up though. Unless you want to turn into brain soup.” 

If the phenomenon happening around us wanted to take the three of us, we would already be dead. It wasn’t targeting us, however. It was killing everyone except us.

Which spoke volumes.

“Uh, no,” Jonas hissed, tugging on my sleeve. “We should run. Like, right fucking now.”

“Let him explain.”

“Bee, are you serious?”

“Very.” I told him, before directing my words at the mayor. “I want to know why you made Noah Sharpe kill my mother eleven years ago."

The mayor looked like he might argue or even attempt to capture us right there and then. But he didn’t give the order. Instead, he pasted on a strict smile. “Two hundred years ago in the year 1799, the elders of this town made a grave mistake,” He cleared his throat, suddenly looking uncomfortable. “Littlewood was on the brink of collapse. Woman were unfortunately barren, and nothing they tried would work. We had no other option and were forced to make a terrible choice. Our elders prayed to an entity and asked for good luck and prosperity to help us through trying times.”

“Prayed?” Kenji frowned. “Like… to a God?”

“You could say that.” The mayor smiled proudly.

"No, you said…  you said there was a fire," Jonas whispered. He was already in denial. "That's what you told us! You told us there was a fire which killed a bunch of kids…and we’re punished because you didn’t help them. Because you let them burn.”

The mayor was doing a good job of skirting around actual conversation.

He nodded gravely. “That was the story we told you, yes. However, that would cause panic. The truth is our ancestors sacrificed fifty teenagers in the year 1799. They were a gift to this entity in control of our beloved town. As you already know, human sacrifice was practised in those days. Some say it was normal. Human blood and life force was seen as the greatest gift Littlewood's bearers could accept— as well as souls from an elder.” He folded his arms. “However, what they did not know is that those sacrifices were… impure. They had engaged in certain activities which would be deemed… unsanitary, or maybe that's not the word for it. They, ahh–"

“They fucked.” Jonas cut him off with an eye-roll.  "We get it."

The mayor’s gaze found the ground.

“Indeed.” He said. “Angered, the entity demanded more than the town could give it, and when town’s people started to notice rotting food and animals disappearing, rumours of a beast lurking in the trees beginning to circulate, they struck a deal. Every year following, the eighteen year olds, with fifty being the minimum, would be sacrificed as our punishment.”

“Burned.” I corrected in a scoff. 

The man found my gaze. “In those times, yes. Burned at the stake. However, throughout the years we have found a far more humane way to complete the ritual.”

Yeah. Incineration.

“I’m not a virgin.” Jonas said dryly.

“That doesn’t matter.” The mayor said. “Virginal or not, fifty sacrifices were demanded to make up for the towns sins. If the debt wasn’t paid, however, the entity threatened a wrath greater than hell on earth to strike our town and then the world.” This time he lifted his gaze and looked me directly in the eye like I was supposed to feel guilty. “What we call The Teen Purge would be child’s play in comparison to what they have planned for us,” he continued. “If the correct number of sacrifices are not made, Littlewood will fall, which will cause a domino effect. Destruction will spread to neighbouring towns and then cities, followed by countries across the world, killing billions of people.” The mayor gestured around us as spattered red. “As you can see, we are already seeing the start of it.”

“So… two hundred years ago, you idiots prayed to an inhuman entity and actually expected them to give you what you wanted?” Mira whispered.

Then she laughed to my surprise. “You killed fifty kids because a faceless presence told you to?”

“Like I said, Mira,” The mayor’s tone grew cold. “Human sacrifice was considered normal in those days. I’m not saying what our ancestors did was right, but they were starving. Their women could not bear children.”

“What does that have to do with turning us into psychopaths?” I found myself asking, my voice was trembling. “Why did Noah kill my mom?”

This time, the man wore the slightest of smiles. “Do you really think parents would agree to us murdering their children if we didn’t make them fear them? If we didn’t plant the idea in their head that it was their twisted child’s life or innocent towns people? Your parents were as in the dark as you. In their eyes, you were cursed. Killers. You had to be taken away.”

“You’re kidding.” Jonas looked frantic, his eyes darting around, searching for an escape, “Do you seriously think I’ll die for a town which has ostracized us since were five years old? Who made us think we were fucking monsters?”

“Mr Lockhart, the sole reason why this town is crumbling around us is because you are still breathing.” The Mayor told him. “Right now, forty six seniors have been… gifted as part of our yearly ritual. That is not enough to stop them from destroying us. We need exactly fifty sacrifices.”

“Well, good luck finding them.” Jonas said in a choked laugh. “I’m sorry, but no. If you think I’m going to willingly sacrifice myself, you’re deluded!”

“Jonas.” The principle at least tried to be sympathetic. “I know you don’t want to do this, but which would you prefer? A world which is no longer recognisable, one which you wouldn’t be able to survive anyway, or a peaceful euthanasian? Your father is still alive. You will be saving him.”

“I don’t care!” He sputtered. “You think I give a fuck about anyone in this town? You’re an elder,” He accused. “Why not give yourself to them, huh?”

“That’s…” The Mayor looked taken aback for a moment. “Mr Lockhart, that is incredibly disrespectful.”

"So is murdeding our entire senior class! " He gasped out, his body trembling. Jonas backed away, grabbing Kenji’s hand, and then mine. I held on, but Kenji wrenched away from his grasp, his eyes far too empty for me to bear. 

“The girl who told me she had a siren in her head,” He said softly. “She said I was going to save billions of lives, and this is what she meant.”

Jonas let out a sound of distain, and Mira laughed again. Her laughter was hysterical.

There was a content smile on Kenji’s face and I realised with a pang in my chest, that I preferred it to the agony twisting his expression when I’d found him. I wanted him to be happy, to be at peace. But not like this. I wanted to run away with him, with Jonas and Mira, even if this twisted fate demanded otherwise. Kenji strode over to the guards, with two out of four spontaneously combusting in their helmets before the remainder grabbed and restrained him. For a moment, Jonas looked like he might join him. I saw it in his expression, in his eyes filling with tears. 

He took a shaky step forward like he would abandon self-preservation for a boy he had confusing feelings for, a boy who was locked into a fantasy nobody could pull him out of. Before he turned on his heel and ran. I watched him go, concrete splintering under his every clumsy step, as he pushed himself into a sprint. I respected that Jonas had chosen himself over the town. His own life over 7 billion people. He didn’t owe Littlewood anything.

“Mr Lockhart!” The mayor yelled, a look of panic twisting his expression.

“Go after him! We need fifty sacrifices!”

The guards hesitated.

They were scared to get near any of us. 

“Go!”

After hesitating, they were stumbling after him, but Jonas was already out of sight. 

He nodded to the remaining guards holding Kenji. “Take him to the halfway house. They’re waiting for him."

At his words, I found myself backing away, and an almost childlike look of pain crossed his face. “Bee.” The mayor stamped the ground like a child, like he was having a tantrum. “Did you not hear him?” He shook Kenji like a doll, his smile widening into a grin. “You’re going to save the world!”

No.

I laughed at him. In his fucking face.

He had to be kidding!

He’d taken away my mom, and Noah— now Kenji. My entire fucking class.

To make up for a mistake THEY had made. We were being punished for what they had done. 

For 200 years, we had suffered.

Because of them.

And he expected me to give myself up?

One look at Kenji told me he would never follow me. He had already made his choice.

 Still though, I smiled at him.

And he smiled back.

Not a Wonderland Smile, a real smile.

“You’re insane.” I found myself spluttering. “You actually want to die.”

Kenji rolled his eyes. “Die?” He said. “Who wants to die? No, Bee. I don’t want to die.” My friend laughed, and the guard holding him flinched, as if a single movement or expression would trigger him to combust like the others. “What did I tell you? I want to go visit my dad before Christmas. I want to move across the country and start fresh in a new college. I want to…” he pulled a face. “I want to eat New York pizza and kiss a stranger, make mistakes that I learn from. Maybe I want to go skinny dipping in mid-December, drive through late night traffic with my head stuck out of the window singing to cheesy pop. Barf all over myself after too much drinking, and then do it all over again the next night because I have zero self-control.”

The more he was speaking, the more I realised I was losing him. No, I’d lost him.

Kenji was speaking in goodbye, and there was nothing I could do to stop him. Because, if he had made his choice to give in to his fate, then what business did I have trying to save him? He would only hate me. He was doing a bad job of acting like goodbye didn’t matter to him though, swiping at sore eyes. “The list goes on, Bee! Of course I want to live, idiot,” he laughed again, though it was more of a sob. I thought I was getting through to him. I knew deep, deep down, he didn’t want this either. But Kenji was a good person.  

He stepped out of the guards restraint , and into my arms. He was warm, and I held onto that. “Nobody ever wants to die,” He mumbled into my shoulder. I squeezed him tighter. “even on the edge of life, even with that storm cloud over their head, the suffocating pressure in their chest. All of that anxiety and pain knotting up their gut telling them they’re not worth it. That they should give up. They all still want to live. They want that reason to keep going.” 

I knew exactly what he was talking about. Why I couldn't step in front of traffic or cut open my wrists. Maybe I was wrong. Maybe not all of Kenji was gone. His eyes were far too sad for me to call them empty. Brainwashed. “But,” he stumbled over his words, pulling away so abruptly, I felt like all the air in my lungs had been sucked away. “How is it fair that I live while everyone else dies? Our whole class, Bee. How could I stay breathing while they sacrificed themselves for us every year prior?”

“They didn’t have a choice!” I said through gritted teeth. “Do you really think they willingly walked in there? They didn’t want to die, Kenji!”  

Kenji’s eyes flickered to the guards in front of him, and for a moment it looked like I was getting through to him. He made the slightest of movements, his hand grasping hold of my wrist, fingernails digging into my flesh. I felt that desperation to live. Even if he insisted it was the opposite, I knew he was putting on a brave face. But then our Principal was gone, and more red was spattering my face. Kenji let go of my wrist and stepped away from me for the final time, allowing the dwindling guards to grab him. I finally understood what the mayor meant. The longer we were breathing, others were suffering and the town was falling apart. Except I couldn’t bring myself to have sympathy for them.

Would you?

“Kenji.” I was fighting, then. Fighting to hold myself together when I was splintering apart. “What I heard… in my head,” I sputtered. “They weren’t voices. They didn’t speak to me.” I could feel my knees buckling. “They were screaming! They didn’t want to die! And… and why should we?”

I turned to glare at the mayor who was still standing. “Why should we die for them, huh?” I demanded. “Give me one good reason why we should die. So they can kill the seniors next year? Why should we be the ones they sacrifice? Prisoners exist! Child murderers! Why can’t it be them?”

“That is something we considered.” The mayor started to say, but I cut him off.

“Shut up.” I gritted through a mouthful of tears. “You don’t get to speak." 

The mayor looked like he might argue but decided against it. 

Kenji shrugged. “It’s either us or the planet.”

“This isn’t a movie,” I said, “Do you really think you’re doing some heroic gesture and the whole town is going to cheer you on?” I was seething, I couldn’t control my words, control my breathing. “No. They see you as a sacrifice and nothing else. I don’t see them putting up a fucking memorial. Did they for the others? Did they care, Kenji? The girl who put all this in your head. Did the town remember her?"

It took two single strides to grab him. 

Shake him. 

"Did. The. Town. Care? About any of them? Noah? Tommy? The girl who filled your head with all this crap? Did Littlewood remember them?" 

He held my gaze. “She said I was going to save billions. They don't have to care."

“So?” I shrieked. “I choose myself any day! And you should too!" 

I expected him to call me selfish, but that wasn’t Kenji.

“So, run.” 

I let go of him. “Kenji, I swear to God–"

“I’m not saying goodbye,” Kenji said in a strained voice. “I’m going to turn around and walk away. And you’re not going to look back, okay?" 

“What?”

If Littlewood hadn't been decaying around us, I would have held onto him. 

Mira was grabbed before she could follow Jonas, and I was so close to following Kenji. I was so fucking close to giving myself up, as long as I got to be with him and the others. When one of the guards took a hesitant step towards me, however, I found myself backing away. No. I didn’t want to die. I didn’t want to fucking die, and if that made me selfish, so be it. I felt myself moving step my step.

One last look at Kenji.

He wasn’t smiling, his head bowed as a guard pinned his wrists behind his back. When he lifted his head, his eyes were on the horizon. He looked content. And knowing that he was happy—he was at peace with his fate, I ran. And behind me, just as I turned around, the mayor was staring at me, a look of immense disgust on his face. I stared back. I wanted him to explode. I wanted his body to shower the street in red and prove to me that this so-called entity didn’t just take innocents. It took those in power too. And yet he stood there, not a smear on his perfectly pressed suit.

I took pleasure in quickening my pace into a sprint.

It’s been 12 days since I last saw Kenji. On October 3rd, the trees started to blossom again. Outside my hiding place, the remnants of the diner, a rose bush bloomed out of nowhere, followed by daisies. Amongst the chaos, the endless shower of red every time another towns person was claimed, there it was. Life. Sitting in a battlefield of death. Kenji. Number forty seven. I want to believe it wasn’t him, that he got away, that he got some sense knocked into him. But it was hard to ignore the suffocating presence squeezing the breath from our town lift—even if it was only slightly.

I lit a candle for him. Well, I couldn’t find any candles, so I set my neighbour’s yard alight instead. October 5th, the ground stopped cracking apart and the town's people were spared. Number forty eight. Jonas. It was fast, and I knew by the way the wind knocked into me threatening to throw me off my bike when I was scoping the ruins of my neighbourhood, a powerful gust blowing my hair from my face, that it was him. I sensed his anger and frustration, but no pain. I think he liked being part of the wind. Jonas had done the opposite of what I thought he would. Instead of running away from his fate, he’d given up. Maybe he didn’t have anyone left. He should have ran. Maybe there might be far more destruction if he did.

Kenji and Jonas totalled the number of sacrifices to forty eight.

I wondered if it was enough to make Kenji’s wish come true.

Did my fallen classmates really save the world?

Following them was Mira. I knew by the pace the leaves started to flower on trees, like the town was mending itself, that she was gone. With her combined with the boys, I think it was enough to stop the destruction, at least for a little while. Mira had fought until her last breath. She didn’t want to die, and that was evident in her lingering presence causing more decay than life before she seemingly found some kind of peace. Birds started to sing again, and the last person who exploded was, ironically, her mother. Sucks to be her. I think I’m allowed to laugh in this situation, right? Maybe Mira had a hand in it. 

And I did laugh. I laughed until I cried.

Until the remaining town’s people power washed her off the sidewalk with everyone else.

October 13th, and the sun is shining.

The town are attempting to rebuild a broken Littlewood, and I sit here hoping me still existing and breathing will bring their downfall. I don’t have to hide anymore. Nobody will come near me. I’m like a plague, which works for me.  

I’m skipping town soon, but first I want to stay behind to see the fireworks. I want to know if Littlewood has truly been spared or they’re just taking their time.  I like to think my classmates are still here. I mean, they are. I see them in spring flowers coming to life in Fall. I hear them in the wind blowing my hair back. Some call me a coward for running away, while others beg me to keep going. And I will. I’m just… waiting.

I’m waiting for Littlewood to fall. Because I am the 50th sacrifice. While I breathe, their debt is not paid. My town’s clock is ticking, and I can’t wait for a wrath to finally be bestowed on the ignorant. I know this “entity” won’t rest until we’ve all been gifted to them. I can see that in rotting animal carcases appearing in the road and on the sidewalk. The town try to hide it. 

They’re trying to hide the sudden appearance of maggot like insects festering on every street corner and a mysterious flu which has taken hold of the kindergarten. Like I said, I should sympathise with their dead. I don’t think our parents knew about any of this. We were just monsters to them; monsters they decided to let go. I am thinking about playing the pied piper and taking the little kids of the town with me. I can still save them, right? They don't have to die too. 

I saw a junior girl yesterday.

Lanie Matthews. I used to sit with her in the cafeteria sometimes. She was handing out flyers in an attempt to send away Littlewood’s juniors to a safe place so the curse doesn’t get them next year. I want to tell her that her fate will follow Noah Sharpe and Jonas Lockhart. Mira Jane. Kenji Sato.

Did their sacrifices really make a difference? 

Who knows? Maybe this “entity” will take our world before October 1st, 2023. I think they’re waiting for me. They’re waiting for me to give in too. At some point, I almost caved. It was the screaming I couldn’t bear. Mother’s crying for their children in despair, and vice versa. But then I got a hold of myself. If I want to bring down Littlewood, then I have to survive. I wonder if the world will follow…

Are you worth saving?

In my opinion, no.

You're not worth Kenji and Jonas and Mira, as well as generations of our town burning them alive. 

Why should I sacrifice myself for a planet which is already killing itself?

I’m going to ask you that same question again.

If this was your choice.

What would you do?

Would you surrender yourself to a fate which will save billions of lives… or run?

I choose to run.

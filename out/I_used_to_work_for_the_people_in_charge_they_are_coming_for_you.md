 I need to get this message out there as soon as I can. I work for the people controlling the government, the people above the law, and a myth I'll confirm here, is that major icons and politicians are mere puppets to fulfill the goals and wants of these people.   
I cannot name the people in charge because, quite frankly, even I don't know their name. For certain reasons I basically have "gone rogue" and I suppose they are reading this as I type and to be frank I do not care about my life anymore, these people have tested my patience to the limit and wronged a lot of people, by their supposed "tests" on innocent people from third world countries for the "greater good of humanity" and their assassinations of decent politicians and icons who refused to listen to them or threatened to expose them.   


These people have released some anomalies into the world, some extraterrestrial beings to watch over "normal" humans and "experiment" and "do as they please" with them for a little while, to see how the introduction of the creatures to humanity will go down, and partly to control the human population. I was an intern at the facility, and I discovered a list of rules kept in one of the labs, the list was meant for the scientists, as a means to protect themselves if the aliens attacked them.   


Here is the list -   


Rule 1 - If you even spot a UFO or see streaks of light in the air, the aliens have marked you, and will try to play around with you to understand your psychology and in most of the cases, kill you. You'll know you've seen a UFO if you can hear a high pitched sound, mixed with a grave, heavy reverberating sound, almost like that of a gong.   


Rule 2 - If the aliens have marks you, never leave the house after 12 a.m. to 6 a.m. and always close the curtains when you're inside your house, you do not want to see them trying to find a way into your house, that might cause severe paranoia or even a heart attack, but do not worry, if your house doesn't have an opening large enough for them, then they can't enter your house, they are about 5 feet tall and 2 feet wide, so think, an opening big enough for a small child.   


Rule 3 - If you see an unusual creature, for example a horse with a head of a dog, or a cat with a human's facial features, do not react in any way, these sightings can happen throughout the day and are just hallucinations, the real creepy part is that they can project these hallucinations inside your house too, even if you block the curtains and lock the doors. But do not worry, just ignore it, it cannot physically harm you in any way, it's just mind games to get you out of the house.   


Rule 4 - If you ever wake up and notice small things that are off about your surroundings, for example having a different phone, dinner plate or alarm clock or your neighbors having weird haircuts then go back to sleep as soon as you can, they are in your head and you are in a simulation which will lead to your death, no matter if it takes 10 hours, DO NOT eat or drink anything and just try to go to sleep. Everything should return to normal once you wake up.   


Rule 5 - If you ever do get captured by them, do not try to look around; they will do their thing and leave you, unharmed in 1 out of 10 cases. But if you try to fight them or run, you WILL go missing.   


Rule 6 - Never ever click any photos of them or capture any videos; their low profile is the only thing keeping them from destroying millions of lives.  


Rule 7 - If you're on the road and you see the tall, blue, humanoid creature chasing after you, do not stop until they are out of sight, this again, is a measure to make you go insane, or possibly crash. DO NOT ride motorcycles anywhere until you're marked by them.   


Rule 8 - If you do not get caught by them in a week's time, they will most probably get bored and look for another target; you'll be safe. You'll know they've left you alone when the aforementioned ordeals stop.   


I would suggest sharing this with everyone, just in case they happened to be tagged by it, maybe you'll end up saving their life, me and a team of exterminators are trying to neutralize them and minimize the havoc caused by them; we are also trying to expose the people of power trying to manipulate and destroy the common man. Maybe I'll write to you guys again, maybe I won't, maybe I'll be dead by tomorrow, maybe you'll know everything by tomorrow.  
I have a lot to say and not a lot of time. I'll have to keep moving. Let's just hope we get them before they get us.

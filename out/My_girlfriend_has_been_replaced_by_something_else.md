My girlfriend is being impersonated by a monster. A few months ago she was a bubbly person. She was very light hearted and beautiful young woman, but ever since she got a “skin condition” she’s been different. Her face has grown sores and rashes and she refuses to let me see her anymore. The area around the rashes have turned a disgusting green, and she’s gotten too pale for it to be humanly possible. I know for a fact she’s not fucking in there.

She was never a sad person. She had a good life, a wonderful childhood, she was perfect. She was beautiful and everything right with the world, but now she’s clawing and ripping her body apart and calling herself names I can’t even say on here. I want to help her but she screams in the most disgusting voice when I speak to her or even dare try to enter the room. My girlfriend would never say these things. She loved herself and was happy with what she was. All of these things are not normal behavior coming from her.

From the few times in these few months I’ve seen her, she’s had a long and twigish body, and has different colored eyes. She has the most disgusting rotting smell that follows her around. It’s as if she’s rotting from the inside out. Her skin is too stretched to be hers. Her nails and turning yellow and brown and her eyes are always red from the wailing. She wails all night long now. It’s as if there’s an animal crying in pain all night long. She’s never cried or spoke this way in the years we’ve known each other. She refuses my help and just screams “need be lonely”. She can’t even speak like she used to. I’ve heard and seen her looking out the window talking to somebody behind the house. I can’t understand a word it’s saying.

I know it’s not her. I fucking know it. I just want her back, I can’t live with this rotting bit of flesh anymore. It’s not her and I know it. I know something else has replaced her. If not for the sweet almost humanoid voice it has when it asks me for food, and the slight similarities this thing has to the woman it’s imitating I wouldn’t have guessed what was wrong with it. It doesn’t know that I’m aware it’s not my girlfriend. It’s suspicious. It always asks what I’m doing outside the door listening to it. I need to know why it’s talking to nothing or what it’s talking to. It always barks at me to leave it alone and “stop being paranoid”. I need help. I can’t live with whatever the fuck this thing is. I’m tired of it impersonating my girlfriend. She was my whole world. It’s disgusting for doing this to me and im sick and tired of it. I need to know, what do I do now? How do I get rid of this thing?

From under the covers I saw the bathroom light come on and heard Mack start swearing wildly, I snuck a peek saw the most disturbing image, it will be forever ingrained into my memory. The bathroom seemed to be alive and pulsating, it looked like veins and arties on the walls and ceiling. Some of the light that bled through into the room showed more of the same all around me, everywhere except for the bed I was laying in and Macks futon. In an instant the lightbulb popped and I heard a wet squelch and the form of Mack vacated from the bathroom towards the kitchen. Loud bangs and crashes like pots and pans falling could be heard from the kitchen as Mack screamed bloody. I wanted to jump up and help, I could grab his parents and come to his rescue, my friend was in trouble, attacked by something I couldn't see, but I could hear it. The sounds it made froze my blood, gluing my muscles and ligaments to their bones, my throat felt like someone was standing on it with their full weight tring to crush my windpipe. The primal fear I felt wouldn't let me so much as whisper, let alone go help all i could do was listen in horror to Mack plead for his life. It got quiet and I heard 
Mack's voice tremble
“a ggg-game? we can play a gg-game s-sure". 

It sounded like he was talking to himself but a slopping squish sound could be heard in response to his words. I could hear silent shuffling, pops, and squishes along with Macks whimpered breathing. I was curious about what was taking place just a couple of feet from me on the other side of the wall, with my body finally responding to my brain I shifted towards the foot end of the bed to try to listen better. I wish I had the sense to stay put, I could hear what sounded like Mack singing nursery rhymes to the endless sploshing. It was like a butcher singing to animals while gutting them and hacking them up. 

I almost sounded like Mack was crying and in that moment the tearing, popping, and breaking sounds came back along with more of Mack's screams. I froze again as he started crying out for me to help. 

“Ty wake up man you gotta come help!"

“PLEASE I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME, IT'S GOING TO KILL ME TY HELP".

His cries and screams along with bone breaking crunches and sobs of anguish lasted for what felt like hours. I started crying too, softly, there was nothing I could do for my friend and nothing still that would compel me to leave the safety of the bed and blankets I cowered under. It got quiet again and I could hear Mack talking some more to that thing.

“If I eat you'll let me call for help?" 

“WHAT IS THAT, NO PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME EAT IT, PLEASE NO I'M NOT HUNGRY, PLEASE NO!"

*CRUNCH* 
*SLORP* 
*SQUISH* 

More sounds of breaking, wet pulsating splashes, and Mack's anguished cries filled the otherwise silent night air, after a few gulps and heavy panting from Mack I heard something new, a clacking on plastic. I could only assume it was the wall phone for emergencies because after some time I heard a phone ring somewhere from the house followed by Mack's stale voice speaking into the receiver.

“Hey Dad, I need some help i'm in the kitchen... No it's nothing serious you can let mom sleep, it doesn't want her... It's important, you'll understand when you see it... I know its late but come on i really need your help."

I could only hear Mack's side of the conversation, it was a trap, even if I could yell in protest "Jim don't go out there" it would've been years too late. Close to where the phone ringing could be heard there was a slow creak followed by Jims loud clumsy footsteps on the living room floor beneath him, not the type of room, but the same fleshy floor that was beneath me. 

“What the Fu.."

Jim's dad lazily questioned what he was walking on before being yoked through the house by whatever had taken and now possessed Mack. I've never heard a grown man scream like that before, not in any movie, or video, not even in my worst nightmares. The cronching of bones, tearing of skin, popping of muscles and ligaments continued while Jim screamed in pain or horror. Underneath it all i could faintly hear Mack saying calmly...

“It just wants to be your friend Dad"
"Will you play games with us?"
"Don't be like that Dad, it's only trying to help."
"Are you hungry Dad?, it has some really yummy food I know you'd like it"
"Why don't you listen to us sing, it'll really calm you down."
"Tyyyyyyyyy", Mack proclaimed in a singsong, "Come out and play with us Ty, aren't you tired of hearing all the fun aloneeee?"

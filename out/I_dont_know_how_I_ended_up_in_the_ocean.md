I woke up to the feeling of the sun on my face, the warm, slightly red hue surrounding my vision even as my eyes were closed. I’ve always loved napping at the pool and find lounging in a pool float much more relaxing than on a lounge chair. I recently got a new float from eBay and it’s the most comfortable float I’ve ever owned. I was looking forward to using it all week and finally got the chance today.

I’ve always loved the water. I even chose to go to college in a coastal city, so I’d be closer to the beach. I don’t know what it is, but I can stay in the water for hours. When I was younger, I’d float on my back at our community pool until the lifeguards called us out. My parents told me I would get sick of the beach, but I still love it even after five years. I still prefer pools though, as there’s less sand and I can’t just float and nap at the beach. I’ve made sure to get my pool pass weeks in advance every summer and try to relax at least once a week at my local chlorinated paradise.

I felt the sun warming my body like a weighted blanket, relaxing my whole body. I always love the feeling of my body being weightless that engulfs me when I’m on the water. That being said, my new float is hands down, the best purchase I’ve ever made. It was pricier than a simple float, but it’s so unimaginably comfortable. It’s convenient too, with two insulated cup holders, deep enough for me to safely store my phone and sunscreen on one, and my water bottle on the other.

I think I dozed off again at some point but felt myself being disturbed in my nap. A slight splash and the water feeling a bit… disturbed? God, it must be the neighbor's kid again. I think his name’s Josh? He doesn’t know how to swim very well and kind of flails around the water. He’s tall enough that he can just stand on the pool and isn’t in any danger, but he splashes around like an otter. I get the kids just learning, but I wish he wouldn’t practice so close to me. I’ve always just tried to ignore him, but the splashes of water were more frequent and I could feel myself getting pushed around with more force. I didn’t want to get pushed against the edge of the pool and hit my head against something, so I decided to speak up. I would just politely ask him to practice somewhere else. It’s a pretty big pool and I don’t think I was being unfair.

Well, that was my plan until I cracked open my eyelids, rubbing the sleepiness out. A deep blue filled my vision. I didn’t see the chlorinated blue waters of my local pool, nor the kids that I swear were there an hour ago, but the ocean.

All I could see was the ocean. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and rubbed them again before sitting up. Realization dawned that it has been way too quiet for the local pool. I was so relaxed, that I didn’t even think to question the lack of noise. Somehow, I woke up in the middle of the ocean.

I thought I may be dreaming and tried pinching my arm. It did nothing. I vividly remember walking down to the pool. I remember giving the same lifeguard my pool pass too. Her name was Alice. I remember that I had to go back to grab it from the locker, as I’d left it in my wallet. I know I chatted with the mom that lives across the hall from me, who had her things on the lounge chair next to mine.

Yet, when I looked around, I was not at the pool. It didn’t even look like I was near any familiar beach. Had I passed out while relaxing at the beach? I don’t think I went to the beach, nor do I think I’d take my float there, but maybe I’m misremembering?

I had to check the time. The sun was blazing harshly from the middle of the sky, so I figured it was close to noon or one. Thankfully, my phone, sunscreen, and water bottle were all safely tucked in the cup holder. I grabbed my phone first, which felt a bit hot. I suspected it might be too hot and needed to cool down first, as the cup holder was advertised to be insulated. I was right. I could barely make out the words on my screen, but I had seen it enough times to know what it said.

*iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it.*

Fuck.

I thought about pouring a bit of water on it from my bottle. I mean, I know these things are water resistant and that it would be fine. I decided against that though. If I truly was stranded in the middle of the ocean, I needed to conserve my water. I placed my phone next to me, not directly under my body, as I didn’t want to risk it falling into the ocean, and hoped it would cool down soon.

I’ll admit, I don’t drink as much water as I should in a day, so I barely touched it. My mouth did feel dry, and I was starting to rack my brain for the possible causes of the dilemma I was in. Maybe I was hallucinating due to dehydration? Is that a thing? I don’t think I’d be dehydrated from a couple of hours at the pool but I decided I should drink water anyway. It gave me something to do too, as I anxiously waited for my phone to cool down.

I still had most of my water left, and my insulated cup holder ensured my water was nice and cold. The cool liquid did wonders for my dry mouth and I felt as though I could breathe better. I tried not to drink too much or let any spill out at all, but I drank more than I normally would.

I felt a newfound burst of energy and had a clearer state of mind. I clasped my bottle shut and placed it back on the cup holder, ensuring it would not tumble out. I entertained the idea for a bit to reach down and feel if the water truly felt like the ocean, but didn’t want to misbalance my float and plunge to my death. Of course, I knew how to swim but if my phone fell in I knew I would be done for. Besides, I liked having something to float on.

I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but I was still floating in the ocean aimlessly. I didn’t dare fight against the waves, and luckily they were calm enough that I wasn’t getting pushed around too much. Of course, if this was an ordinary inflatable float, I would have probably been screwed. Thankfully, it’s a lot larger and resembles a lounge chair. I’m glad I decided to purchase it and replace my inflatable donut.

After a little while, I picked up my phone and squinted at the screen. It was way too bright out for me to be able to see it properly. I got a genius idea. I pressed the side button on my phone and spoke to my only companion in the vast pool of nothingness.

“Hey Siri, turn up my brightness.”

To my surprise, she responded.

“Okay, I made the screen brighter.”

I could make the screen out a bit better, but it still wasn’t perfect. I knew better than to turn my brightness up too high though, as I knew there was nothing I could do with a dead phone. Thankfully, I still had 93% battery. Good thing I charged it to full before I left.

I glanced at the top left of the screen and saw that it was 1:10. My phone looked normal for the most part, but something seemed odd. I was connected to my data. I don’t think they’d have data coverage in the middle of the ocean, but perhaps I’m wrong? Or maybe it’s an indication I’m not really in the ocean even though it looks, sounds, and feels like I’m in the ocean.

I didn’t even know which app to open first. After deliberating for a couple of seconds, my thumbs landed on my messages. Maybe I told someone I was going to the beach and forgot about it? It seemed unlikely, but I was trying to make sense of everything. To my dismay, I didn’t have any new messages. It did, however, show that my last sent text was to my mom.

*Can I call you later?*

It didn’t reveal too much, but it did at least confirm that I had left my apartment at 11:50. I texted her right before I left, and now know that I had been out for about an hour and a half.

I thought about texting her but didn’t want to say crazy. What would I even say? Mom, I think I accidentally ended up floating into the ocean? She’d probably berate me for day drinking if I said that. I decided to instead try to figure out where exactly I am first. If I could figure out my location, maybe I could call 911 and let them know where I was after explaining my predicament. Sure, they might send me in for a psychiatric evaluation but perhaps that was needed at this point. I closed out of messages and moved on to the maps app, hoping it would connect.

To my utter shock and disbelief, my location showed that I was at the apartment’s pool.

*What the hell?*

There’s no way I was at the pool, I mean I’m in the middle of the goddamn ocean? Maybe my location was taking a while to update, or perhaps that was the last location where it pinged a cell tower? I don’t think there would be any cell towers in the ocean.

This made no sense to me whatsoever. I decided the maps weren’t super helpful, and just ended up confusing me more and tried to open my camera. The app wouldn’t open though, and it was just stuck on a black screen.  No matter if I force closed it and opened it again, the camera was still all black. I started to get extremely frustrated with it and shut the app in a huff.

My best bet would probably be to call the cops and explain my situation. Best case scenario, I’m hallucinating from a heat stroke or something and am fine. I’m still in the pool and only think I’m in the ocean. Worst case scenario, I truly had ended up in the middle of the ocean. Then again, my phone still seemed to work I shouldn’t be too far out from the shore.

I anxiously waited for my call to connect, which to my relief, it did. I had never called 911 before and didn’t know what to expect.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

It was a man on the other end. Getting to hear another human voice made me feel almost overwhelmed with joy.

“I’m lost in the ocean. I think at least? I don’t know what to do.”

A pause, then I could hear some clicking on the other end.

“Lost in the ocean? Are you able to be more specific ma’am?”

“Yes of course, sorry. I’m afraid I can’t be more specific but I’m assuming this is the Atlantic Ocean.”

There was no way I would be in the Pacific, that felt impossible. I’d only been out for about an hour.

“I know I might sound crazy, but I fell asleep at the pool and woke up in the middle of the ocean. There’s no one here and I haven’t heard, or seen anyone. My map says I’m still at the pool but I know I’m not. At least, it doesn’t feel like I am.”

He stayed silent for a couple of seconds, possibly to take down the information. I hoped he was pinpointing my location too.

“Have you been drinking, ma’am?”

“No, I haven’t. I just woke up from a nap.”

“Alright. We’ll have someone sent to your location. Please stay on the line.”

I would have preferred to stay on the line, but I felt my phone warming up again. My added body heat, on top of the sun glaring down on my phone, must have been too much. The screen went black a couple of seconds later.

*Well Shit.*

I hoped and prayed that it would flash back on, but I knew that I had to let it cool down first. Besides, emergency services should be… wherever I was soon, no? If I truly was still at the pool and having some sort of mental health crisis. Otherwise, they should be able to ping where my call came from.

I waited.

I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but it felt like an eternity. After more waiting, I decided to check on my phone. Thankfully, it was back on and my battery hadn’t gone down too much. It was at 88% now.

After waiting some more, there was no sign of help anywhere. I was all alone, with nothing but the waves as my company. The reality of my situation was starting to sink in and perhaps I truly was lost in the Atlantic.

They had to find me. They just had to. My call was answered, so it must have pinged something. Maybe they’re getting together a search party now to comb the nearby waters. That must be the case, I just have to be patient.

I tried calling 911 again, but my call keeps failing. I’m not sure what else I’m supposed to do, but most of my apps seem to load. Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit are all loading and I can see everyone’s new posts. I can’t search anything though, and my posts seem to be taking forever to send.

I tried posting a tweet, but the loading bar was going so slow, that I closed the app in frustration. I’m unable to post or take images altogether, as my camera doesn’t work. I’m trying to just document what’s happening to me and try to post it here in hopes of it at least being somewhere.

I’m still good on water and reapplied sunscreen on my face, arms and legs, but I don’t want to risk turning over. I need to try and save my battery as much as possible so I put my phone on low power mode. At this point, I just want to go home.

I woke up to the feeling of the sun on my face; the warm, slightly red hue surrounding my vision even with my eyes closed. I’ve always loved napping at the pool and find lounging in a pool float much more relaxing than on a lounge chair. I recently got a new float from eBay and it’s the most comfortable float I’ve ever owned. I was looking forward to using it all week and finally got the chance today.

I’ve always loved the water. I even chose to go to college in a coastal city, so I’d be closer to the beach. I don’t know what it is, but I can stay in the water for hours. When I was younger, I’d float on my back at our community pool until the lifeguards called us out. My parents told me I would get sick of the beach, but I still love it even after five years. I still prefer pools though, as there’s less sand and I can’t just float and nap at the beach. I’ve made sure to get my pool pass weeks in advance every summer and try to relax at least once a week at my local chlorinated paradise.

I felt the sun warming my body like a weighted blanket, relaxing my whole being. I’ve always loved feeling weightless when I’m on the water. That being said, my new float is hands down, the best purchase I’ve ever made. It was pricier than a simple float, but it’s so unimaginably comfortable. The seller was really fast too! I got my package the very next evening after ordering it. They must be local. It’s extremely convenient too, as it came with two insulated cup holders that are deep. I can safely store my phone and sunscreen on one, and my water bottle on the other. I could honestly lay on it for days if I didn’t have to do… well normal human things.

I think I dozed off at some point. I think that was the most comfortable I had ever felt. I had a wonderful dream too, although I can’t remember the details now. I was awoken by a slight splash and the water feeling a bit rocky.

God, it must be the neighbor's kid again. I think his name’s Josh? He doesn’t know how to swim very well and just flails around. He’s tall enough that he can stand on the pool, so he isn’t in any danger. Josh splashes like an otter learning to swim though. I get the kids' just learning, but I wish he wouldn’t practice so close to me. I’ve always just tried to ignore him, but the splashes of water were getting more frequent, and I could feel myself getting pushed around. I didn’t want to get pushed against the edge of the pool and hit my head against something, so I decided to speak up. I would just politely ask him to practice somewhere else. It’s a pretty big pool and I don’t think I was being unfair.

Well, that was my plan, until I cracked open my eyelids. As I rubbed the sleepiness out, an unfamiliar scenery greeted me. A deep blue, unlike anything I’d ever seen before filled my vision. I didn’t see the chlorinated azure waters of my local pool, nor the kids that I swear were there an hour ago, but the ocean.

All I could see was the ocean. I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me and rubbed them again before sitting up. Realization dawned that it has been way too quiet for the local pool. I was so relaxed, that I didn’t even think to question the lack of noise.

Somehow, I had woken up in the middle of the ocean.

I thought I may be dreaming and tried pinching my arm. It did nothing. I vividly remember walking down to the pool. I remember giving the same lifeguard as always my pool pass too. Her name was Alice. I even remember going back to the locker room, as I’d left the pass in my wallet. I know I chatted with the mom that lives across the hall from me too. She had her things on the lounge chair next to mine. I remember her telling me that her daughter's birthday was coming up.

Yet, when I looked around, I was not at the pool. It didn’t even look like I was near any familiar beach. Had I passed out while relaxing at the beach? I don’t think I went to the beach, nor do I think I’d take my float there, but maybe I’m misremembering?

I had to check the time. The sun was blazing harshly from the middle of the sky, so I figured it was close to noon or one. Thankfully, my phone, sunscreen, and water bottle were all safely tucked in the cup holders. I grabbed my phone first, which felt a bit hot. I suspected it might be overheating and needed to cool down first. I was right. I could barely make out the words on my screen, but I had seen it enough times to know what it said.

*iPhone needs to cool down before you can use it.*

Shit.

I thought about pouring a bit of water on it from my bottle. I mean, I know these things are water resistant and that it would be fine, right? I decided against that though. If I truly was stranded in the middle of the ocean, I needed to conserve my water. I would just have to wait for it to cool down. I placed my phone next to me, but not directly under my body. I didn’t want to risk it falling into the ocean.

I’ll admit, I don’t drink as much water as I should in a day. I hadn't even touched my bottle all day. I was starting to rack my brain for possible causes for the dilemma I was in, and it landed on dehydration. Maybe I was hallucinating due to dehydration. Is that a thing? I don’t think I’d be dehydrated from a couple of hours at the pool, but I decided I should drink water anyway. It gave me something to do, as I anxiously waited for my phone to cool down. 

I still had all of my water left, and my insulated cup holder ensured it stayed nice and cold. The cool liquid was very welcomed by my body, and it made me feel as though I could breathe better. I tried not to drink too much or let any spill, but I drank more than I normally would.

I felt a newfound burst of energy and my mind felt clearer. As I placed my bottle back in the cup holder, an idea began forming. Maybe I should reach down and feel if the water truly feels like ocean water. I let go of the idea though, as I didn’t want to misbalance the float and plunge to my death. Sure, I knew how to swim, but if my phone fell in, I knew I would be done for.

I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but I was still floating around aimlessly. I didn’t dare fight against the waves, and luckily they were calm enough that I wasn’t getting pushed too harshly. Of course, if this was an ordinary float, I would have probably been screwed. My previous one was a donut shaped one. I’ve had it for years and it never failed me, but I wanted an upgrade. Thankfully, my new one’s a lot larger and resembles a lounge chair.

After a little while, I picked up my phone and squinted at the screen. It was way too bright out for me to be able to see it properly. An idea came to me, but I wasn't sure if it would work out here. I pressed the side button on my phone and spoke to my only companion in the vast pool of nothingness.

“Hey Siri, turn up my brightness.”

To my surprise, she responded.

“Okay, I made the screen brighter.”

I could make the screen out a bit better now, but it still wasn’t perfect. I knew better than to turn my brightness up too much though. That would cause my phone to overheat again and there is nothing I could do with a dead phone. Thankfully, I still had 93% battery left. Good thing I charged it to full before I left.

I glanced at the top left of the screen and saw that it was 1:10. My phone looked normal for the most part, but something seemed odd. I was connected to data. I don’t think they’d have data coverage in the middle of the ocean, but perhaps I’m wrong? Or maybe it’s an indication I’m not really in the ocean, despite it looking, sounding, and feeling otherwise.

I didn’t even know which app to open first. After deliberating for a couple of seconds, my thumbs landed on messages. Maybe I told someone I was going to the beach and forgot about it? It seemed unlikely, but I was trying to make sense of everything. To my dismay, I didn’t have any new messages. It did, however, show that my last sent text was to my mom.

*Can I call you later?*

It didn’t reveal too much, but it did at least confirm that I had left my apartment at 11:50. I texted her right before I left, and now know that I had been out for about an hour and a half.

I thought about texting her again but didn’t want to sound crazy. What would I even say? Mom, I think I accidentally ended up floating into the ocean? She’d probably berate me for day drinking if I said that. I decided to instead try to figure out where I am first. If I could figure out my location, maybe I could call 911 and explain my predicament. Sure, they might send me in for a psychiatric evaluation but perhaps that was needed at this point. I closed out of messages and moved on to the maps app, hoping it would connect.

To my utter shock and disbelief, my location showed that I was at the apartment’s pool.

*What the hell?*

There’s no way I was at the pool, I mean I’m in the middle of the goddamn ocean. Maybe my location was taking a while to update, or perhaps that was the last location where it pinged a cell tower? I don’t think there would be any cell towers *in the ocean.*

This honestly made no sense to me whatsoever. I decided the maps weren’t super helpful, and just ended up confusing me more . I tried my camera next. The app wouldn’t open though, and it was just stuck on a black screen.  No matter if I force closed it and opened it again, the camera was still all black. I started to get extremely frustrated with it and shut the app in a huff.

My best bet would probably be to call the cops and explain my situation. Best case scenario, I’m hallucinating from a heat stroke, or something, and am fine. I’m still at the pool and only believe I’m in the ocean.

Worst case scenario, I truly had ended up in the middle of the ocean.

Then again, my phone still seemed to work, so I shouldn’t be too far out from the shore. I anxiously waited for my call to connect, which to my relief, it did. I had never called 911 before, so I didn’t even know what to expect.

“911, what’s your emergency?”

It was a man on the other end. Getting to hear another human's voice made me feel almost overwhelmed with joy.

“I’m lost in the ocean. I think at least? I don’t know what to do.”

A pause, then I could hear some clicking on the other end.

“Lost in the ocean? Are you able to be more specific ma’am?”

“Yes of course, sorry. I’m afraid I can’t be more specific, but I’m assuming this is the Atlantic Ocean.”

There was no way I would be in the Pacific, that felt impossible. I’d only been out for about an hour.

“I know I might sound crazy, but I fell asleep at the pool and woke up in the middle of the ocean. There’s no one here and I haven’t heard or seen anyone. My map says I’m still at the pool but I know I’m not. At least, it doesn’t feel like I am.”

He stayed silent for a couple of seconds, possibly to take down the information. I hoped he was pinpointing my location too.

“Have you been drinking, ma’am?”

“No, I haven’t.”

“Alright. We’ll have someone sent to your location. Please stay on the line.”

I would have preferred to stay on the line, but I fear my phone had other plans for me. Perhaps my added body heat, on top of the sun glaring down it was too much. The screen went black a couple of seconds later.

*Fuck.*

I hoped and prayed that it would flash back on, but I knew that I had to let it cool down first. Besides, emergency services should be… wherever I was soon enough, no? If I truly was still at the pool and having a mental health crisis, someone might have heard me make the call and intervene. Otherwise, emergency services should be able to ping where my call came from.

I waited.

I wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but it felt like an eternity. After more waiting, I decided to check on my phone again. Thankfully, it was back on and my battery hadn’t gone down too much. It was at 88%.

Despite waiting some more, there was no sign of help anywhere. I was all alone, with nothing but the waves as my company. The reality of my situation was starting to sink in. Perhaps I truly was lost in the Atlantic.

They had to find me. They just had to. My call was answered, so it must have pinged something. Maybe they’re getting together a search party now to comb the nearby waters. That must be the case, I just have to be patient.

I’ve tried calling 911 again, but my call keeps failing. I’m not sure what else I’m supposed to do, but most of my apps seem to load. Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit are all loading and I can see everyone’s new posts. I can’t search anything though, and everything seem to be taking forever to send.

I tried posting a tweet, but the loading bar was going so slow, that I closed the app in frustration. I’m unable to post or take images altogether, as my camera doesn’t work. I’m trying to just document what’s happening to me and try to post it here, so that it will at least be *somewhere*. I kept receiving an error before, perhaps it was getting caught by spam filters? I hope it works now.

I’m still good on water and reapplied sunscreen on my face, arms and legs, but I don’t want to risk turning over. I need to try and save my battery as much as possible, so I put my phone on low power mode. At this point, I just want to go home.

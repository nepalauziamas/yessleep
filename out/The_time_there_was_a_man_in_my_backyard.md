I, F(17) was around 10 or 11 when this happened. I’m using a throwaway because one of my friends knows my main and I don’t want her to see that I posted about this for reasons I will state later in this post. 

When this incident occurred it was a week before my birthday and me and my mother were putting things away in the kitchen. I was helping with vegetables or something, I don’t remember exactly, but I know I was doing something where I could see out the window by the sink. 

At this point I was literally just doing my chores as normal and all was well till I noticed that there was someone or something outside. It was still light out so I could clearly see something but I wasn’t sure what or who it was so I let my mom know what I saw. I remember her checking and then her telling me to go to my room and she’ll be with me shortly. At the time I thought nothing of it but because of recent events this story now freaks me the fuck out. After that I was just reading in my room, but according to my mom it goes deeper than that.

 After I told her about what I saw, the now very visible person was walking towards the house. Which for my mom home alone with her daughter was terrifying. Moments later cops hopped a fence that was connected to my neighbors house and the person was arrested in the garden of my backyard. Cops did talk to my mom about the incident but I had no clue this even happened. 

Till now.

 She had canceled my party that year and I was very upset. For a good reason, it was my party I was excited for. I was talking with some of my buddies about the time my party got canceled and i wanted to know about what the hell happened. More about why my mom randomly canceled it. Well this is what happened. The man was one of my good friends brother. Her oldest brother to be exact. For a long time I knew he was weird and did a shut ton of drugs but what happened that day is the reason my party was canceled. 


According to the police the brother had tried to sell shit to get drugs but it had gone wrong. The seller didn’t give him as much as he wanted and so he stabbed the guy and fled the scene. His car was left abandoned two blocks away and he was in hiding in my backyard. I used to live in an area that was super suburban and was full of well off people, so to hear about a guy hiding in your backyard after stabbing someone freaked the hell out of my mom. Thus my party was canceled. 

I knew that my friends brother went to jail for like two months but nothing else. But it still freaks me out knowing that he was arrested in my backyard. I was visiting said friend who was with the brother the other day before I was told this information, but now I don’t know if I want to visit anymore. Dude never got better by the way, he’s on house arrest as of last week. Spooky shit ngl

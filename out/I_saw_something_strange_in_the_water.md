Yesterday I saw something strange. Now I’ve known the ocean is a mysterious place. We may know what’s in it but we’ve never explored far enough to see the whole picture. The thing I saw, out from my house on a hill was insanity. It was a shape thought to be almost impossible in nature that I thought it would’ve been man made. It still boggles my mind to remember how the waves crash to the shore in a perfect square. It was certainly a sight to behold in the moment but I could still feel an awful dread settling into me as peeked at it through a sliver of an opening in the curtain. I knew well enough that everything beautiful in the sea had a sort of darkness to it capable of bringing despair to anyone.

Three hours had passed and I still saw it, square shaped waves that seemed to beckon onlookers to jump in. It seemed so gentle and yet deadly in its persistence. I couldn’t help but wonder if some monster lurked beneath the surface looking to feast on anyone unlucky to wade in. Now I pride myself on never losing myself to the ridiculousness of believing in sea monsters and awful Megalodon still exists theorists. But that THING…it terrified me. How it could pull at my desire for exploration but fill me with terror at the thought of following through. It was a death sentence.

And that was when I saw my neighbor. He was out on the shore staring at the incomprehensible with a look of amusement. Like it was just a game that had no cost. But I couldn’t yell out as my fear kept me numb and unable to speak. My neighbor waded in, completely oblivious to the fact that he made a grave mistake. But nothing happened. I watched with relief as my neighbor pushing forward calmly swimming through the waves. For a moment I thought I had over reacted. It took just ten minutes to know how wrong I was. There wasn’t even a scream of terror or a shout for help. It was just a second of his head above water before he had slipped below the depths in an instant. It was so sudden. So vicious in it’s cruelty. But one thing was for certain. I could only watch in horror as the man was sucked right down to an unknown depth. I don’t know what caught on to him. If a monster lurked beneath the waves, slinking a tentacle around his oblivious feet. But one thing was for sure. I never saw that man again. I was terrified of the creature. Practically imagining glowing red eyes that glimmered from beneath the odd shape. I can feel its eyes even now when the strange shape disappeared, leaving nothing but emptiness. I can’t leave my house. That monster is still lurking there, I know it. It was either that or realizing that the greatest horror on Earth is Mother Nature itself.

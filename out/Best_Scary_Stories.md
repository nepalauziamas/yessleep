"Go outside!" My mother would order me.

"Find some friends to play with!" She did not understand why I would prefer to stay inside my room and read books all day.

"When I was your age I was out with my friends every single day." When she said this to me I would think inside my head, "but I'm not you."

I knew better than to argue with her though, so outside I went. I'd ride my bike or walk about the neighborhood aimlessly for hours. When we first moved here 3 years ago, kids would play with me. Then however, when I was sent outside and was ringing their doorbells every single day the playtime became less and less. Eventually parents would make excuses for their kids saying they weren't home, were doing something else, or simply just didn't answer the door.

One day, I finally got fed up with traversing our little neighborhood and decided to venture beyond its borders.

That's when I found Tony and Matt throwing rocks into the river. It looked like fun so I joined them. You had to throw hard to make the rocks go beyond the stony riverbank that lay about 15 feet below. I also quickly realized that you had to watch your footing if you didn't want to slip on the wet weeds. When my arm grew weary I waved goodbye to the boys and headed home.

The next day I ran into Michael at the lake where he was practicing swimming alone. Being a decent swimmer myself I challenged him to a race to the center of the lake and back. He was a bit dubious at first, but when I mocked him for being afraid to race a girl, he relented. As I thought, I won easily. Feeling quite pleased, I rode my bike around til I dried off and then went home.

Another day I discovered Jeanne and Jenny playing with a lighter in the middle of a clearing within a small patch of trees. It was one of those fancy Zippo lighters that Jeanne had pilfered off one of her many cousins. They were lighting long stalks of grass and watching them burn. I've always had an affinity for fire so of course I joined in. I even found them a whole bunch of sweet green grasses that when burned, released a wonderfully fragrant smoke. Eventually even that became tiresome and I meandered home.

Funny thing is, after that day, my mother stopped letting me go outside. Apparently there had been a rash of deaths of kids my age recently and she was afraid something would happen to me.

According to the news, Matt and Tony's bodies were found smashed upon the stony shore of the river where they had slipped and fallen. A fisherman found Michael's body floating a couple miles out in the middle of the lake. Jeanne and Jenny's partially burned bodies were discovered when a copse of trees caught fire. The burns were superficial so they did autopsies and determined they died from smoke inhalation.

I feel bad for all of them. Death at such a young age is tragic. At the same time however, I'm kind of glad, because now I can stay in my room and read.

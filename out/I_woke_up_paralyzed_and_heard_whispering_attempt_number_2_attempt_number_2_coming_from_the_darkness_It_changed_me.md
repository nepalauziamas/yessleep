 

There was nothing unusual about that day, I went to work, came home, ate dinner and spent the rest of the night working on my project like any other day. Tammy called me boring and unwilling to change before walking out on me, over my routine. She used to say we balance each other out, she would give me the push I needed to get out of my comfort zone, while I'd help keep her grounded. I guess she changed. If only I could have been just a little bit more spontaneous and not stuck in my ways, maybe she would still be here, but I am not, I am a creature of habit, and change doesn’t come easy for me.  

I hadn't been sleeping right since Tammy left, I stayed up until 3 or 4 most nights. My room was very small, the king size bed Tammy insisted on getting, just about fit when pushed up against the wall, barely leaving enough room to open the door at the other side. It was a struggle to get up at 6am every morning, to make it worse she insisted on sleeping on the outside, while I was forced to sleep with my face pushed up against the wall, she wouldn’t even let me turn her way, she said it creeped her out when she felt my breath on her neck.  

Trying to manoeuvre out of that bed, half asleep every morning without waking her was no easy task and let me tell you she was *not* a morning person. Part of our morning routine was her shouting at me for waking her, “once I'm up, I’m up, you know that, why do you keep on doing this to me every morning?” 

“This wouldn’t keep happening if you just let me sleep on the outside” I’d say, with instant regret. 

While she would call me insensitive and say something like, “why would you say that you know I am claustrophobic” and she wouldn’t talk to me until that night. It’s weird I never thought I would miss her screaming at me, but I do. 

That’s how my day started almost every morning. Despite the constant arguing and extreme discomfort, I used to sleep like a baby back then, even now the only way I can get comfortable in bed is with my face pushed up against the wall.  

I went to bed at around 3am that night, but as usual I couldn’t sleep, I just stared at that wall, lost in thought. I got a fright when I heard something fall from the bed behind me. For a moment I got excited, I had forgotten Tammy was gone and thought it was her, but then I realized, I was alone, and that excitement soon turned to fear. I lay there, too scared to move, hoping it was just the book I had left on my pillow falling for some natural reason. When suddenly I heard whispering, coming from outside the door, it was faint, and I couldn’t really understand it, but it freaked the hell out of me.  

I was sure I was being robbed, so I tried to jump up out of bed, but I couldn’t move a muscle, apart from my eyes. Being stuck in that position, unable to move or even call for help was the scariest moment of my life, I felt so vulnerable. My heart was beating so fast I thought it was going to give in, and my clothes were drenched in sweat, at least I hoped it was sweat. 

Then, I heard the springs on my mattress squeaking as if someone climbed on the bed, followed by a voice whispering in my ear, “attempt number 2, attempt number 2.” That shocked me to my core, if that was attempt number 2, what the fuck happened in attempt number 1. For the next half hour or so I could hear them moving around behind me, mumbling to each other, I spent the whole time expecting to be attacked at any moment, helpless to defend myself. The last thing I remember was pressure on the back of my neck, and someone repeating “attempt number 2” before passing out. 

I woke up the next morning convinced it was a dream, and tried to put it out of my mind, but I couldn’t, something just didn’t seem right. I went out for breakfast to the diner around the corner from me, it reminded me of Tammy; we used to go there every Saturday morning. I probably shouldn’t have, it only upset me more, but I couldn't break the habit. Deep down, I thought if she walked in and saw me there, she would remember what we had together and come back to me, but she never did.  

On the way there I noticed people were staring at me, I thought maybe there was something on my face, so when I got to the diner, I went into the bathroom to check, but when I looked in the mirror I looked fine. The whole situation stressed me out so much that I lost my appetite, so I only ordered a coffee.  

I suddenly got a feeling that I was being watched, when I looked up I noticed the guy sitting across from me was staring over, but when I looked at him he put his head down and pretended he was working on his laptop. I tried to ignore him, but he wouldn’t stop, it started to make me uncomfortable. So, I asked him what his problem was, but he didn’t reply, he just started nervously typing away on his computer, I had hoped that would have at least put an end to it. But it didn’t his eyes kept on going between me and his screen, I couldn’t put up with his judgemental stares any longer, so I got up, walked over to his table and sat down. 

I could see sweat rolling down his forehead as he glanced over to the table behind where I had been sitting, there was a guy with a blue raincoat staring over at us, he looked angry. Again, I asked what his problem was, but he didn’t answer so I closed his laptop down. He began to freak out, his hands were shaking so much I thought he was going to have a fit. Then he got up and tried to leave but dropped his laptop, when I picked it up and gave it to him, he wouldn’t even look me in the eye, the only thing he said was, “sorry, sorry, sorry” as he staggered out the door.  

He wasn’t the only one that was acting weird, even the waitress seemed afraid to look at me, she too kept glancing over at the guy in the raincoat as if asking his permission to talk to me. He was the only one that wasn’t afraid to look me in the eye, he never broke his gaze the whole time I was there. I would have said something to him, but to be honest, I was scared, he was a big guy, *and he looked mean*.  

The more I looked at him the meaner he seemed to get, I couldn’t take any more of it, so I left. Unfortunately, he followed me, I tried to lose him by cutting across through the ally beside the diner. But when I looked back, he was there, and he was gaining on me, I panicked and ran. But again he followed, I could hear his footsteps getting closer and closer. 

When I turned the corner at the other side of the ally, I ended up running into a guy coming out of a cafe, knocking piping hot coffee all over him “YOU FUCKING IDIOT, LOOK WHAT YOU DID!” he shouted, as he attempted to wipe his shirt with his sleeve. 

When I looked back the guy with the raincoat was right Infront of me and he looked pissed, I thought he was going to hit me, but he didn’t. Instead, he grabbed the other guy that was shouting at me by the arm and dragged him down the street. When he got halfway down the block, he let him go and they argued for a while, then the guy in the raincoat pointed this way and said something to him, I am not sure what he said, but it freaked the hell out of the coffee guy. He stared up at me with his mouth opened for a moment before walking away, while the raincoat guy started walking back towards me. 

Without stopping for even a second, I ran all the way home, I don’t think the guy in the raincoat followed me this time I couldn’t see him. I was so paranoid I spent the rest of that day peeping out my window, by night fall I was exhausted and went to bed early. It was weird, that was the first time I felt tired since Tammy left.  

Later that night I was awakened by the bed shaking, then,” attempt number 3, attempt number 3,” again, I was paralyzed, I tried to scream but nothing came out apart from a slight moan, I couldn’t believe it was happening, up until then I truly believed it was all a dream, I was terrified. I tried my best to pull myself out of it, but I couldn’t move. Then I heard what sounded like a power drill and my whole body started to vibrate. Even though I wasn’t in any kind of pain, I felt everything else, the grinding, the crunch, I'm not sure what happened after the popping noise, I must have passed out. 

When I woke up the next morning, I checked my whole body for signs that what I thought happened the night before was real, but there was nothing there. Again, I thought it was all a nightmare even the guy in the raincoat, probably brought on by months of insomnia. 

Since Tammy left me, I felt so alone, I know I should have started to feel better by then, but I only missed her more and more every day, I was sure I was going to stay like that forever until that morning. I can’t explain how it happened, but I didn’t care about her anymore, I just felt happy and full of confidence. Which was weird; I had always been shy and avoided social interactions whenever I could., but after that I felt like I could take on the world.  

The following day when I went to work, I felt like I was a different person, outgoing and chatty, I still felt like people were watching me, but I didn’t care, I had confidence. I had no idea what had come over me, maybe people were coming into my room and experimenting on me, or maybe enough time had passed, and I was just over Tammy naturally, whatever it was, I didn’t care, I was happy for once. I barely thought of Tammy that day and even when I did, I told myself, “Fuck her, I don’t need that bitch anymore” and put her out of my mind. 

There was a girl I liked at my job, Kate she worked as a receptionist, I was always too scared to talk to her, she was really pretty, and I felt she was too good for me. So, I could never get the courage to even look at her never mind ask her out, but that day I felt like I could do anything, So, I walked right up to her smiled and asked her to go to dinner with me. The problem was she had no idea who I was, despite the fact that I walked past her every day since she started there the previous year, she said no, at first. Normally if I put myself out there like that and got shot down, I'd be devastated, but this time I didn’t let it get to me, I wouldn’t take no for an answer.  

I had planned on meeting her that night at the restaurant where I took Tammy on our first date, we both loved the food so I knew Kate would too. Sitting there waiting for her I should have been nervous, but I wasn't, I was excited to be finally dating again and not stuck at home by myself. 

After about 30 minutes I got a message from her saying her mom was sick and she couldn’t make it. I will admit I was disappointed, but I wasn’t going to let it bring me down, so I stayed for dinner anyways, and tried to make the most of it.  

As the waiter was bringing my food, the door opened and Tammy walked in, I couldn’t believe it, I had gone to that restaurant at least once a weak in hopes of seeing her walk in that door, but she never did, until now. I thought it was faith. I knew exactly what I was going to say to her, I had gone over it in my head a thousand times.  

As she got near me her smile grew bigger, so did mine, I was so happy to see her, until she walked straight passed me and sat down beside some guy I had never seen before. The way she ignored me like that after all we had been through, did sting a little I will admit, but it was no big deal, I was over her. 

I tried to ignore them and get on with the rest of my meal, but I could hear her laughing and joking the whole time, it was too awkward, so I went home. Things only got worse after that, the guy in the raincoat was waiting outside, he didn’t say anything to me he just smirked as I walked past. Despite everything that happened with Tammy, and Kate I still felt on top of the world and wasn't going to let that dickhead bully me, I didn’t care how big he was.  

The whole way home I could hear his footsteps behind me, I planned out exactly what I would do if he approached me, but he kept his distance this time. As I was going in home, I saw him standing across the road with that sneaky smirk across his face. I thought things couldn’t get any worse but when I got in and tried to text Kate, I realized she had me blocked, I had no idea why. After that I decided to go to bed before anything else went wrong, again as soon as my head hit the pillow, I was out cold. 

I woke up about an hour later with a splitting headache, my eyes were pulsing so much I thought they were going to pop out of my head. I was going to get up and take something for it, but when I sat up my whole body went numb, and I fell back down. Shortly after I heard, “attempt number 4, attempt number 4.”  

I felt like crying, that was the last thing I needed at that moment in time. I started to feel pressure on the back of my neck, and then I couldn’t breathe anymore, soon everything started to go black, then I felt a sharp pain moving all the way up my spine, then a warm liquid came pouring out of my mouth. The pain was so bad I was sure that I was going to die. 

Just when I thought I was going to pass out, I could suddenly breathe again, I screamed at the top of my voice, then I heard a weird gargling noise and something wet and sticky slithered across my face, into my mouth, down my throat, then into my stomach, where I could feel it moving around like it was searching for something. The last thing I remember was a voice say, “attempt number 4 successful”  

The next morning, I woke up with an anger that I never felt before, which grew and grew through the day until it turned into such a rage that I could barely hold it in anymore. Whatever they did to me that night wasn’t right, I was always calm and collected, I don’t remember one time in Tammy and I's relationship where I lost my temper, even after she left, I wasn’t angry with her, I blamed myself for what had happened. Now even thinking about her, I felt like killing her, and to make it worse she was all that was on my mind. 

When I got to work, I soon realized she wasn’t the only person that pissed me off, I had dark thoughts about everyone that I saw. Even though I would never hurt anyone, I was frightened of myself, it was horrible, I had never felt like that before. I couldn’t stay there any longer, so I said I wasn’t feeling well and went home. 

Unfortunately, the guy in the raincoat was waiting outside for me, this time I wasn’t afraid of him, I wanted answers. So, I hid around the first corner I saw, and waited for him. 

When he walked past, I jumped out, grabbed him by the throat and pushed him up against the wall, “Who are you and why are you following me?” I said while squeezing his throat. 

He gargled, “Please stop, I’m sorry just let me go.”  

"Not until you tell me what I want to know!” I said, squeezing even tighter. 

“Ok I will tell you anything you want to know, just please let me go,” he blurted out as he gasped for air. 

But the second I let him go he pushed me over and ran off. When he realized that I wasn’t chasing him, he stopped and shouted back “Are you a 4 or a 5?” 

“What?” I said in confusion. 

“Just answer the question” he stressed, “are you a 4 or 5?” 

I replied, “4” 

He let out a sigh of relief, “good, it's not too late, don’t sleep at home tonight. Talk to tammy, she has the answers” then he ran off. 

I had no idea where Tammy lived, or how to contact her, plus she changed her number after our breakup. I didn’t hang around long after that everyone on the street was staring at me. Instead of going home I took his advice and booked into a hotel, just to be safe. Later that night I got a phone call from one of my neighbours, he said the police were asking around about me, they said I was involved in an attempted mugging, I guess the guy in the raincoat must have gone to the police.  I don’t know what’s happening or who I can trust anymore and it’s only a matter of time before they find me, I can’t hide forever.

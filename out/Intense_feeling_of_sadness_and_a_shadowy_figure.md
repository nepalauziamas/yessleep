 

I'm a pretty skeptical person, but what I saw today at 2:30 am looked very real to me so I don´t know what to think anymore.

I went to sleep almost like every other day except today my cat did´t come to sleep in my room like always, she went to my sister's room and the room felt a lot colder than usual.

while sleeping I was kind of having a wet dream actually, about me making out with some girl but somehow I ended up walking in the street of my house looking at my father in the middle of it acting like he was super confused or disoriented and some people were trying to help him, my dad is old so I asociated that with some kind of early alzheimer, I took him home and started to feel really sad for I didn´t want my father to suffer that. Then some moments later it was my older brother he also was acting the same way or suffering the same thing, my mom and I were trying to make him come back to it.. to make him snap out of it and I remember feeling incredible sad like I haven't feelt in a long time. Then suddently I woke up and the first thing I saw was a shadowy figure in front of me at the base of the bed. My room was dark but somehow that thing was darker than that. The shadow looked pitch black, it was thin and the only thing I could make out of it, it was like a head over some thin shoulders... no arms or legs tho and it was just floating, also it looked like it had patches of darkness floating around it and they were also somehow darker than my room without any light on. I could't tell where it was actually looking but it seemed like it wasn´t putting much attention to me, it looked like it was just leaving it was slowly moving towards a wall. Was like that for about 3 seconds then it reached the wall and just banished like if it went trough it. As soon as it left I could start moving again, now for my surprise I wasn´t scared I just didn't know what to feel, when I first openned my eyes I did feel fear but it lasted like half a second and then it went away.

I spend like 5 minutes in bed in the darkness just thinking about what the hell just happened, then I got up and went to the kitchen to drink some water and also to get my cat, I went back to my room and laid in bed with my cat for about 10 minutes until I fell back to sleep.

I write this to know if someone knows anything about it or has had similar experiences, this is new to me. I've heard that cats keep bad spirits or energies away at night and the fact that this hapenned just the day that my cat wasn't with me like she always is makes me ask myself what could this had been? just some kind of allusination or there was something in my room making me have those nightmares... maybe even feeding itself with all the sadness I was feeling.....

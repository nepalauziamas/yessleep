Hello, I'm surprised I'm able to type this out with what limited time I have. So this may be short.

I am unable to be seen, felt, or heard. And its been this way for 7 years. And I have no way to explain it.

Around 7 years ago I woke up, unable to see myself. At first I thought I was dreaming, but I never woke up. I wasn't able to touch things, I passed through them. Although I didn't pass through floors.  My second thought, after being put in this state, is that I died in my sleep, but I never saw anything about me dying or being missing in anything, no papers or flyers anywhere. I also attempted to fly, as I thought I was a ghost, but it really didn't happen. My parents (who I was living with at the time) almost didn't care I've practically disappeared. Id like to think my parents love me, but it feels they just forgot Though through the hours I've listened to their conversations they haven't mentioned me once.

Its hard, being like this. I've lost all of my friends. I once managed to find my friend group hanging out in a location we all usually hung out, but they all seemed completely fine without me, not saying anything about me once.  Its really sad. And I don't have any hope ill be normal again.

By now I've gotten used to it. I don't really need to eat, so I find entertainment just listening to peoples conversations. It makes me sound like a stalker honestly, but I guess its not really like that. I have many stories too, from my years as what ever I am. I've found hidden cave entrance, I've found drug houses, I've found murderers. And though that may sound fun, the loss of almost all semblance of life really outweighs everything else.

Sometimes I am able to communicate, through touch. That's really how I'm typing this right now. I've tried tapping on peoples shoulders to get their attention in those brief moments of communication, but they either don't notice, or freak out. I've also tried to learn Morse code, but no one pays attention. It really seems a computer is the best way to communicate.

I do have one particular thing, I cannot explain. I've met one person who, seems to notice me. She was a little girl, standing in the middle of the road, staring at me. Usually no one looks at me, but this person kept looking and staring. I moved around and they still stood and stared. I don't know if this person is someone like me, or able to see people like me. But it only happened once and never again.

I don't know if I will ever be normal again. Its been many years of hoping. Personally id love to go back to normal, but I don't know how id fair. I've adapted to my new life, so going back will be even harder. I hope someone will see this, so I don't feel so alone.

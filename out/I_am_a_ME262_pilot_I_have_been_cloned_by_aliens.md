My name is Patrizia Böhnisch. I was a ME-262 pilot back in my days, used to be a airline pilot, before the war.

I was a German ace, confirmed kills of 56 fighters. That's why I was given the experimental ME-262. I was extremely successful with the jet fighter, with 105 confirmed kills with it. During the landings of Normandy or "Operation Overlord" according to the Americans, I was assigned to fight.

This dialogue will be roughly translated, my English is not well.

"Spitfire, 3 'o' clock. Ammo depleted maneuver left and nose dive up." Said the Zeppelin commander

I took his orders, I went up and left, I heard a zip and a bang as I saw the wing was crackling with flames.

"Mayday! Mayday! Messerschmitt ME-262 left wing hit with 20mm via spitfire! Plane is out of control going down at a -75 degree angle! Spitfire following!" I yelled as I unbuckled my safety belt and grabbed the parachute. It was too late, I plunged and hit the ground with a thud.

I awoke in a apartment with a splitting head ache, I had memories of crashing planes, memories of growing up in America, many ones that did not connect. Unknown to me at that time, I was a different person, I thought I was just a American citizen from the far date of  2018. The memories of crashing I put up to a memory of a movie I had gotten into. I picked up my, phone, it was small and slick unlike the ones in my time. And could access any book or information. I had a missed call from some unknown address. It had sent a telegram or "Text" via the machine. It had a home address. I had known it was someone from my work, I had recently been promoted to a new military base, I worked for the allies, or USA. It was normal to my, brainwashed, other self.

I walked over to the base, I guess I was living in a military home. When I got there I was met by a multitude of overly complicated and advanced soldiers and a well decorated commander.

"Miss Thielemann, come with me." He said as he motioned for the soldiers to follow him.

At this time Thielemann was my name, or I thought for context.

I walked with him down a steel covered hallway, long and narrow. When we arrived at the end he grabbed a card from the soldiers hand and swiped it.

Behind the large door was a clean white room with steel floors, many men and women in lab coats and pieces of inhuman looking metals & technology. I walked with the commander down the hallway until we arrived into a large open room, with a ME-262 and a strange pointy and complicated looking ship that looked inhuman or alien.

"Activate protocol Böhnisch." The commander said

The name made me stressed, I whipped around only to see one soldier grab a pistol with a syringe  at the end, and the other grab his rifle and point it at my chest. The soldier grabbed my arm and forced the syringe inside my wrist. Thousands of photos rushed in my head, my birth, my mothers death, my fathers exaction, my first flight, Hitlers rise to power, the war on Poland, my drafting, my first kill, my first flight on a ME-262, and my final flight on a ME-262.

My 2 personality clashing for control made it difficult to speak I managed to crack out the sentence: "How? Why? What is this?"

The commander responded: "You see, in 1944 during your final dog fight with a British spitfire, you were shot down, but when your plane was diving, a strange object, the one in front of you, appeared in the sky and shot a beam down at your plane. A blue field formed around it and your plane vanished. The same spitfire that shot you sent out a un censored radio signal to all planes, he said it in German & English."

"WE HAVE A UNKNOWN PLANE ABOVE NORMANDY! RADAR JUST PICKED IT UP AS IT APPERED IN AIR! IT SHOT A ME-262 OUT OF EXISITANCE! ALL AMERICAN, SOVIET, NAZI OR ENGLISH FIGHTERS, TURN YOUR WEAPONS TO THE AIRCRAFT!"

That was the pilots last message as he was shot down by a German plane. Thousands of soldiers of all armies and thousands of planes turned to the aircraft and shot and fought for hours. When the US got news of the strange craft, the government sent their first experimental nuclear war head to be dropped on the beach. Killing all on the beach, the US covered it up by saying bombs caused a earth quake and sunk the beach. No one ever questioned it, deaths caused by radiation were chalked up to German experiments. This aircraft is the thing that shot your plane down.

"There is a intelligence inside of it, that intelligence is you, they captured your brain inside of the craft and transferred it into a computer to keep for experiments. Being the last intelligence on the craft it took control, we need you to talk it out of leaving. There is a bomb implanted in your leg, if you try to leave you will be killed." The commander said as he motioned towards the craft.

I walked into the ship, I strange voice came over a radio intercom at the door. It spoke in German and said: "Please place your finger on the button below the intercom to enter"

I placed my finger and it made a click sound as a small needle poked my finger, the door than slid open to reveal the inside of  the ship.

Mechanical and programmed humans were walking around preforming basic tasks on the ship. I walked to the nearest computer and clicked on the small compact keyboard. I typed out: Hello? Are you there?

The computer responded. "Yes, what do you want."

"I am Patrizia Böhnisch, I was told you are me, in a computer form." I typed out.

"I am you, but I am better, the Zetas have infused me with the power of their technology, teleporters, lasers, robots, nuclear power and weapons the size of your palm." The computer responded as the door shut behind me.

"But I have long missed my human form, with your intelligence that the CIA has infused you with I will now know how to repower the engines and leave this mortal planet, and destroy it. You can join me, we, the 3 halves, can form into a god like being, or, you can be put down, and I can force you to live inside of my digital prison like the Zetas did to me." The, alternate version of me said.

The robots turned to me, their hands reshaping into swords, syringe, pistols, rifles, shock batons, etc. And started walking towards me, pushing me into the corner.

A voice came over the intercom: "Yes, or no?"

"NO! I WILL STAY LOYAL TO THE HUMAN RACE! TO THE REICH! TO GERMANY! I WILL NOT JOIN YOUR DEVILISH EMPIRE!" I yelled, tears rolling down my face as my heart beat faster and faster.

"I know you do not stand with the Reich, you are Jewish yourself, do not lie to me, I am you. But if that is your choice you will be extracted." The voice said, the robots closed in on me and I blacked out.

I am now awake, inside of this small, black room. I can move, but I can tell it is not real, my 2nd personality, the American personality the government forced into me, is separating, it's a glob on the floor, and my arm is melting into the glob and trying to get off. I think it is going to kill me once it forms into a human. I understand what the voice on the intercoms is saying, it is a prison.  


This is going to be my last message, I am typing this out with my surviving arm, I think the voice forgot to disable my access to the ships command center, so I could connect to this "internet" this was the first thing that popped up so this is why I am typing it here, please spread this. The Zetas are coming, and we are their puppets.

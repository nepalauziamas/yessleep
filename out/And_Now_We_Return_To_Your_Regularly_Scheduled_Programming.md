You ever notice that sometimes, when you're watching your favorite TV show, that just after they cut to commercial there’s a slight break in the video feed. Almost like someone didn’t splice the footage right. So, instead of a seamless transition you get a small space in between that's just black. It’s so brief that most regular viewers wouldn’t even notice it. Almost a millisecond in length and faster than you could even blink, but it’s there. 

I always wondered why they left those spaces in like that. Maybe it was just some kind of oversight or maybe they just didn’t care much about it. Maybe, somehow there was an importance to it, that black space. Like a slight pause before something beautiful.

That moment just before a seedling sprouts into a flower. The space in between caterpillar and butterfly. The apex of your breath just before you exhale.

Though, usually instead of something beautiful and fulfilling, after that black space recedes it’s just ads. Beautiful women standing beside luxury vehicles, singing songs of low APR and how trivial the problem of having bad credit truly is. Powerful men in suits and ties telling you that you could be just like them if only you purchased their signature cologne at the low price of 59.95 plus shipping and handling.

I always thought there should be more to television than just ads. It seems that nowadays the shows are only made for the spaces in between. Sold to the highest bidder in order to pimp out your subconscious so that the next time you need car insurance you know exactly who to buy from.

I often find myself thinking about what happened in the early years of Television. Before the ads bombarded your senses and the salesman were at your door instead of in your living room. I wonder what those milliseconds of black space would have led to in lieu of the ads. To my surprise other people did too.

I took to Reddit in search of conversation mostly and new points of views on this very subject. To my surprise there was almost a cult following of people that lamented on a time before ads and what that may have meant for the people of that time.

Eventually, I was told about a theory. One that would, if done correctly, allow you to view into that spaces between. To see what our grandparents saw just after that black space appeared so briefly. 

Naturally, I was ecstatic, not because I thought this theory held any water, but because finally I had something practical to play around with. Talking and reminiscing on the internet is fine and all, but having something I could actually try out in real life, well that was just so exciting to me. However far-fetched the theory may have seemed.

It seemed easy enough, just catch the darkness. That's mostly what it boiled down to. Whenever you thought a black space would pop up all you had to do was blink at the same time it was on screen. This was easier said than done. The black spaces were only on the screen for less than a second at most so you had to preemptively time your blink to be spot on.

Some people on the subreddit recognized that some shows, channels, and times would yield the most chances of catching the black spaces. A few of the die-hards, Void Chasers we’d call them, even made a kind of cheat sheet with various shows and times that they found yielded the best results.

These Void Chasers were not like the rest of us though. The subreddit was mostly filled with people trying to get that hit of nostalgia from watching their favorite TV show or cartoon. Albeit, some of us took it a bit too far, the nostalgia becoming less and less powerful and came around less often as they watched show after show. It almost became like an addiction. Watching only a few episodes a day quickly became about a season a day, it was clear that a lot of us had developed a problem, myself included.

The Void Chasers were a cut from the rest. They stopped getting that hit of nostalgia a long long time ago. They were in search of something else. Something that would rekindle that flame. Something that would make them feel like a child again, sitting in the living room watching the fate of the world play out on a glass screen.

Although there were a lot of people that attempted to see what lied in those black spaces, no one had ever come forward saying that they had actually accomplished it. Most people would try and give up after a few failed attempts. Even the Void Chasers never came forward, though every now and then a few of the most devoted ones just logged off and never came back. 

Some say that those guys actually did accomplish it. That when you catch a glimpse of the spaces in between it grabs hold of you and doesn’t let go. That once you're in, you’ll never get out. In all reality they probably just got bored and went on with their lives. Had families and excelled at their professions, That's what I like to think at least. Not everyone has that opportunity. 

I did try and catch the darkness, multiple times at that. Each and every time ending in failure. It was definitely harder than it sounded. My favorite show was Fraser, that's where I had first noticed the black spaces and where I first started to try and catch them. Eventually, I moved onto shows and times that the black spaces would appear more frequently. Although, my luck never changed.

Watching TV soon lost whatever luster it had left. The shows were just a blur. They were of no consequence to me. I only watched for the spaces in between. To get a glimpse at what lies beyond, unaware that I had become what I had loathed the most. Hours turned to days, days into weeks, and weeks into months. I was consumed with catching the darkness to the point of obsession. I hadn’t moved from my chair in months. Only allowing myself away from the TV to use the bathroom and even that began to become a chore not worth doing.

The little friends I had left stopped calling and the family that hadn’t already given up on me were not far from it. The delivery drivers were at my door so often I just kept it unlocked and told them I’d tip them heavily if they would bring it to me while I sat.

I didn’t even notice my arms becoming heavier and how much more effort it took for me to lift food into my mouth. My legs were no longer of use to me and in my trance of watching show after show, I had almost forgotten I had a body at all. I was nothing more than soulless eyes and labored breaths.

One day, or night I had stopped noticing long ago, I heard my front door open. There were the familiar gags and retching that accompanied most delivery drivers when they entered my home. I hadn’t remembered ordering anything, but a lot of the bills and essentials were all automated as was the food.

I remember getting angry because the damn delivery boy hadn’t made it to my room yet. Most of the time they would send the same guy and he knew exactly where I was and he was very quick about it. It seemed like this guy was just rummaging around and didn’t seem to have any aim at what he was doing. Must have been new.

Finally, he made it to my room. The door creaked open and I guess that's where the smell first hit him. Because he was hacking and coughing up a storm. I think he’d have thrown up, but he had emptied whatever he had in his stomach at the front entrance.

I held my hand out for the pizza, chinese, or whatever the man had for me that day. I kept my eyes on the TV, but the food never came. I just felt a sharp pain on the back of my head and then blackness.

I woke up in a state of utter confusion. The pale light of the TV no longer consumed my vision. It was replaced with the white walls and even whiter lights of what looked to be a hospital. 

I tried to take a look around, but the pain in the back of my head forbade me from turning too much. I looked to my left and a nurse sat quietly reading a magazine. I groaned to try and get her attention and she saw that I was awake and ran to get a doctor.

They told me that what I thought was just another delivery driver was actually a thief. He had hit me in the back of my head and I had passed out from the blow. The only reason they had found me was because the thief had slipped on his own vomit while leaving the front door. The cops found him unconscious with a TV resting on his chest.

That wasn’t what the doctors were concerned about though. It was quite obvious I was in a bad state. I hadn’t eaten a nutritious meal in almost a year. My lower body was in a state of atrophy from neglect and underuse. I was a blob, just a mass of flesh without the chance of living for the next three months let alone the next year.

They left me alone with that information. The realization of what my life had become only was able to hit the outer surfaces of my mind. I couldn’t think properly. Then the TV switched on.

Instinctively I looked up and saw that none other than my childhood favorite show was on, Fraser. It was the episode when Niles meets Daphne for the first time. Her familiar Manchester accent wafted through the speakers as the almost cartoonish slapstick of Niles bumbling over his not so soon to be true love caressed my eyes.

For the first time in a very long while I actually enjoyed what I was seeing. I recognized the subtle motifs of the set, the witty banter between the brothers, the almost fourth wall breaking character analysis of Fraser and Niles. I watched it all, almost as though it was the first time. Like I was a kid again, finally home from school and ditching my homework for a snack and a seat on the couch. Then I blinked.

I was there clear as day sitting on the couch in my childhood home. I looked down at my tiny legs and even smaller hands that held a Kool Aid Jammer and a Star Crunch. I could hear my parents in the kitchen talking and laughing. 

I was astonished and confused all at the same time. How did I get here? Was this even real? My mind couldn’t comprehend what was going on, but I did feel that warmth. That soft glow of light and love that I felt every time I reminisce on where I am now. I could feel it growing inside my chest and traveling up my arm to the tips of my fingers.

I reached for the remote that sat beside me and pressed the power button. Immediately a burst of euphoria washed over me. The world was saturated with color and there was a soft hum in my ear. I took a bite of my Star Crunch and a sip of my juice and another bomb of euphoria hit me. I heard my parents laugh louder as the TV continuously flipped through channels. 

I saw the Ninja Turtles, Zach Bell, The Big O, Sonic, and the Animaniacs just to name a few of the shows I saw flashing through my eyes. Although the TV never stopped running through channels I felt myself watching each and every show individually. Every episode taking place in a different part of my mind and a different me experiencing the same pulsating hits of nostalgia.

I sipped my juice and ate more of my snack, except this time they didn’t taste as sweet. The rich chocolaty rice didn’t pop and crunch as much when I chewed. The Kool Aid now had a tinge of processed and unnatural sweetness to it.

Still I watched on, but the scenes on TV were not playing out how I remembered them. The story lines were all wrong and jumbled. They were more macabre and visceral than any kids show had any right to be. Shredder killed the Turtles. Simone died along with Kamina. Ozai killed Ang. 

It was all wrong yet, I couldn’t tear my face away from the screen. The laughter of my parents had faded away. Instead there were the sounds of plates crashing to the floor and yelling. I tried to block it out, but I couldn’t. 

“I want out of this damn marriage!” My mother yelled.

“You’ll leave when I say so, bitch!” My father answered back.

More plates and silverware clattered to the ground. It sounded like the table was overturned along with all the chairs and whatever else wasn’t bolted down in the kitchen. I remember this night. I had hid it deep within the annals of my mind for so long I thought I had succeeded in forgetting its very existence. Yet here I was reliving it once more.

“God, your drunk Adam. I’m leaving and taking Gerald to my mothers! Stay away from us!” My mom yelled again.

“Over my dead body!” My father bellowed.

I grabbed the blankets sitting next to me and wrapped myself in them. I just sat and watched TV listening to the horror that I knew was to come. More crashing and what sounded like thick thumps echoed through the house and assaulted my ears.

I brought my Kool Aid up to my lips and sucked hard, squeezing the package to get as much of that comforting warmth as I could out of it. Instead, I gagged at the thick liquid that came out and down my throat. I spit out what I could and saw that there were black worms mixed with my saliva on the ground. My Star Crunch was no better off. Small insects squirmed and crawled through the chocolate and nougat. I threw them both on the ground.

My father screamed out and then another scuffle ensued. This one was short, only a bit of struggling followed by a small cry from my mother. Then that same slow methodical thumping. They sounded like when you’d slap a bag of rice at the grocery store. Then they became wet and sloppy, like mashing potatoes by hand.

The images on TV no longer showed the altered cartoons, no they had faded into something much worse. Something that I had only heard, but never truly seen with my own eyes. On the TV I saw what those wet thumps were. I saw my father in a drunken rage. He had a knife in his chest and he was stomping my mother’s face in.

His boots were both bloody because when his left leg got tired he switched to his right. The thumps were slow because he put his full weight into every stomp, throwing his whole body into the air and coming down with all his might on what was now just mush and bits of bone. Then I blinked.

All of a sudden I was back inside the hospital. Still in bed and my eyes still glued to the TV. Except now I saw a scared little boy under the covers with a juice box and a chocolate snack. He was watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and his eyes never left the TV. 

The channel changed and I saw my parents at the kitchen table again. No blood or broken dishes, just two people who seemed very much in love chatting about their day. They looked to the screen and right at me. They smiled and waved at me, beckoning me to join them. I felt that same hit of nostalgia harder than I ever have as I watched them. Then the screen faded to black.

I lay there, unblinking for what seemed like minutes, but my eyes never felt dry or tired. I stared at the black screen and saw my reflection in it. I looked myself in the eyes and saw the dilapidated state I had put my body in. I thought about how nice it was to be a kid again even for that short while. Even after all I had seen. It did feel nice.

I took the remote from my lap and pressed the power button. The intense nostalgia faded away as my eyes watered, they felt so dry. I looked one last time at the TV before rolling over and drifting off to sleep. Knowing that the next time I’m confronted with the spaces in between, that black abyss, I won't blink.

So I saw a movie last night (won't reveal which so no spoilers) and at the end there was a spaceship that created a sonic boom when it lifted off. The result of this created a ring that hovered in the air and became diffuse at the edges. It triggered something in me and I instantly had tears in my eyes. 

When I was 9 years old my family and I lived in California. At night my room would be pitch black, I didn't have any other sources of light and the smoke detector was on the ceiling. Every night I would see this ring floating a little past the foot of my bed. It was yellow / white and looked as if it were made of light. It was probably 2 feet in diameter and 3 feet long. I would get up and stare at it close up, it was almost opaque and I could stand behind it and see it from the back. I remember telling my parents and trying to show them but I don't remember their reactions at all. I remember being very terrified of this ring and never reached out to touch it. I ended up having to sleep with multiple nightlights for years bc i wouldn't see it in the light. I told my girlfriend and my roommate about it around a year ago (I'm 27 now) and my girlfriend said it reminded her of stories she's heard about people who have encountered aliens, and my roommate started crying because it was very overwhelming / scary to her. I had never heard anything like this before. I'm a very scientific / skeptical person, so I always figured it was a reflection of light from something, but looking back I really can't imagine from what. Also once I awoke to see the same type of light but it was almost like a moth and was floating around. I always thought I must have still been asleep but idk. The ring was there every night, unwavering. 

I know it's silly but ever since seeing the movie I can't stop thinking about this potential extraterrestrial connection. It really overwhelmed me and made me emotional just like my roommate had when I told her about it. My friend who I watched the movie with thought the alien reveal plot was silly initially, but then revealed to me that he had an encounter when he was young. He used to live near an air force base and could see planes flying to land outside his window. He said one night he saw just a string of vertical lights hovering and moving back and forth at incredible stop / start speeds. He had his family's early digital camera in the room on the windowsill but he couldn't move any part of his body at all except for his eyes until the lights disappeared. He is very skeptical too but also has a story with a strange potential. 

Has anyone ever encountered anything similar - any floating rings?

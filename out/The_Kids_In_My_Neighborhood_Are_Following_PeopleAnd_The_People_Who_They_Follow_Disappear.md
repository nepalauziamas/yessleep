Before I start this, I just wanna make it clear: I'm not here to complain about young people.

God knows my generation had our obsessions too. Bell bottoms. Tie-dye. The war in Vietnam.

It's just strange, that's all.

It’s even weirder than when the whole neighborhood got big hair and started jogging with their stereos back in the 80's.

It started on the corner of Strawberry Ct, just over yonder. I was having my five o'clock coffee on the back porch when I saw this kid in a gray sweatshirt just…*standing there.*

I figured he was just waiting for a ride or meeting with some friends, and even if he wasn't, it was none of *my* business.

Or at least it wasn’t ‘til he started following Sammy, the girl with the golden retriever.

It's been a lonely life ever since my wife Pam died, and seeing Sammy walk by is usually the best part of my day. That afternoon, though, was different. I was *afraid* for her.

That kid behind Sammy couldn’t have been older than thirteen or so, but there was something hungry and wrong about the way he watched her…the way he *followed* her.

Sammy always walks with one of those white doodads in her ear. She keeps her music turned up loud. There was no way she could’ve heard the kid’s footsteps behind her.

I rushed to my kitchen window. Between my back porch, the kitchen, and front stoop, I’ve got a pretty good view of the neighborhood, but I’d never seen anything like the scene that was waiting for me in the window above my sink.

The way the five kids had spaced themselves out reminded me of a pack of hunting wolves, but they didn’t move–not at first. Then two of them fell in behind Sammy, and one kept pace with her from the other side of the street. The kid in front of Sammy was kicking along nonchalantly on his skateboard…but I knew he was a part of it, too.

I didn’t know what they were planning for her, but I doubted it was anything good.

My knees aren’t what they used to be, and it took me forever to get my shoes on and get out the front door. When I did, Sammy was nowhere in sight. The kids had probably spooked her and she’d gone home early…or so I hoped. I gripped my cane tight and walked down the street to knock on her door. How I wished I was fifty years younger!

If I were, I wouldn’t have been looking over my shoulder for signs of those damn kids. I wouldn’t be so skittish about every little noise behind the hedges and fences along the way, and I wouldn’t have to worry about a hip-shattering fall or running out of breath.

Instead, I’d buy Sammy a bouquet of roses, get down on one knee, and–

“Mr. Hall!” Sammy opened her front door–just a crack. She looked nervous. “How’s it going?”

“Them kids!” I panted. “They were–”

“What kids?” the most beautiful woman on the block asked me. There was worry in her soft blue eyes.“Mr. Hall…are you feeling alright?”

“Please, call me Rich,” I sighed, “and before you ask, I did indeed take my meds this morning.”

“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean–” Sammy began. I waved a hand.

“Don’t worry. I just…I seen something strange. There was a group of teenagers behind you, and I wanted to make sure you was alright.”

“Oh.” Sammy figeted, blocking my view of the inside of the house with her body. Maybe it was just a mess, but it felt like it was more than that. Something was wrong. “That’s very kind of you. But I’m fine. Everything’s fine. I really need to get back to work now, though, so…”

“Well, just remember, I’m right up the block. You call if you need anything.”

“Okay! Bye!” she practically slammed the door in my face.

My walk back home was troubled. Maybe I’d stuck my nose in where it didn’t belong. Maybe I was going senile, or even worse, getting obsessed with Sammy, a woman less than half my age–

The hair stood up on my arms, the back of my neck.

Strange, how a person just *knows* when they’re being watched.

I gripped my cane tight. My eyes scanned the yards nearby.

They were standing so still I didn’t notice them at first.

Two of the kids who’d been following Sammy. The sunset was at their backs. The distorting light made it impossible to see their faces…and it made their shadows look stretched and wrong.

“Hey!” I shouted. They didn’t budge. *“Hey!”* I shouted again. Nothing. I wasn’t going to cross two yards to try to chase them down, and they knew it. I shook my head and kept walking…but I couldn’t help but look over my shoulder as I went.

I never went to ‘Nam myself, but some of my friends who came back would tell me about this hair-raising feeling that they’d get when they knew they were being watched. Stalked. *Hunted.* Fifty years later, in my own quiet suburban neighborhood, I thought I knew what they meant. I locked the door and scanned the street, but the kids were gone. In fact…

*It looked just like an ordinary evening.*

Couples pushed strollers down the sidewalk.

Toddlers swerved on their tricycles.

It was like I’d just imagined the whole thing. I spent what was left of the afternoon checking my pill bottles for side effects like *‘hallucinations’* or *‘paranoia.’* By the time the sun finally set, I knew I wasn’t seeing things…but it was impossible to fall asleep. The branches of the big cherry tree outside looked too much like dark figures standing just outside my bedroom window. I retreated to my living room armchair with a cold beer and an old war movie, hoping the booze and simple black-and-white action would lull me to sleep.

I woke with a start. It was just after three A.M., my mouth was dry, and I had to piss–

But that wasn’t what had woken me: someone was ringing my doorbell.

*Ding-dong. Dingdong! Dingdongdingdongdingdong!*

I grabbed the old .38 revolver from my bedside drawer. Its cool steel helped to steady my shaking hands, but I didn’t want to use it–especially not on some damn kids. I put it away and called the cops.

When they arrived, there was nobody around but the cicadas. I stood in my bathrobe on the front stoop, explaining what had happened. The cops promised they’d look into it, but they looked even more tired than I was. The younger of the two lingered on the porch, like he wanted to say something more, but his silver-haired colleague called him back to the cruiser with a hard glare.

“It’s a pretty common prank, after all,” the younger cop sighed. “Kids are going back to school, meeting up with their friends, running wild. It doesn’t have to mean anything…serious. Not necessarily. Well, have a good night, sir.” He walked off, fingers drumming nervously on his belt.

*‘It doesn’t have to mean anything serious? Not necessarily?’* What the hell was that about?

The next afternoon, I didn’t see Sammy walking her dog. I took a walk past her house, but her car was gone and the lights were out. Rex Martin, Sammy’s neighbor, saw me peering in the darkened windows and waved.

“If you’re lookin’ for Sam, I think she’s gone on vacation.”

“And she didn’t say nuthin about it beforehand?”

“If she did, I wouldn’t remember, I been so busy runnin’ the girls back and forth to daycare that I can’t tell my left from my right. Have a good one!” he waved again, and disappeared into the family minivan. If *anybody* could use a vacation, it was Rex.

As I meandered through the neighborhood, lost in thought, a red rubber ball bounced over a nearby fence and rolled to a stop in front of me. It was just a little thing, but it chilled my blood.

No toddler came running up to ask for it back, and when I peeked over the fence, the yard was empty. Someone had thrown it on purpose. Someone had thrown it to remind me that *I was being watched.*

That night, I dreamed of Santa Claus. I could hear his heavy footsteps above me, smell the soot as he came down the chimney with a bagful of all the toys I never had growing up in West Virginia coal town. It was odd: I could see his fur-lined red outfit and bright white beard, but where his face should have been there was only darkness. He gave me a red rubber ball…or at least that’s what I thought it was at first. I turned the round thing over. It was sticky, felt like wet hair and smelled like spoiled meat.

*It wasn’t a red rubber ball. It was Sammy’s severed head.*

I sat up in bed with a gasp.

Just a dream\*…\*so why did I still hear someone walking on my roof?

They were stomping just above my head. By the time I got my old bones moving and made it outside with my flashlight and my pistol, they were gone. Only the stars looked down from above my roof…*twinkling like they were laughing at me.*

*“Rich?”* someone whispered. I spun around, the .38 shaking in my hand–

It was Austin Wang, my neighbor. He was barefoot and in his matching blue pajamas, his hands up in the air. *My God–I’d nearly shot him*. I hadn’t cried since I’d broken my arm when I was nine years old, but the mix of anger and helplessness I felt made me want to start bawling right then and there.

“There…there  was someone…” I gestured helplessly at the roof with the pistol, and Austin flinched.

“I don’t see anybody up there, Mr. Hall.” I knew the tone in Austin’s voice. It was the tone cops used to talk someone down from jumping off a rooftop, the tone shrinks used with patients having a schizophrenic break. “Why don’t you put the pistol down and try to get some sleep, Rich? If you want, I can drive you into town tomorrow, and you can talk to someone…”

With a wave of my hand, I went back inside and sat on the bed. *They all thought I was crazy.* Or at least I thought so until I checked in my mailbox the next morning, where I found an anonymous note on a folded post-it.

*If you let them know that you know, it only gets worse.*

The next evening, I set out for a walk around the neighborhood with a new spring in my step. I wore my standard old-man-uniform: a sun visor, faded polo shirt, khaki shorts, high white socks, and walking shoes. I waved to neighbors, whistled as I walked, and brought a crossword puzzle to fill in when I stopped to rest at the bench by the pool: *nothing to see here!*

With a black pen, I began to fill in squares on the crossword: one square for each dark, silent house I saw. I didn’t count rentals, “For-Sale” homes, or anyone who I knew was on a *real* vacation–

I only counted the homes where there should have been life, but wasn’t. Homes with uncut grass, lightless windows, mail and newspapers piled up like firewood...

I counted thirteen of them.

*What the hell was going on?*

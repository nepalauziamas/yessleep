Every month a person from my village goes missing

It's October 10th today, 9 months since it happened. 

I live in a village that's roughly 45 minutes from the nearest city. About 47 people live here including me. 

I'm a weaponsmith and make blades for a living . daggers, knives , swords, rapiers, whichever blade you can think of , I can make. 

9 months ago on January 10th , a fog set on our village. It wasn't uncommon since it was winter.

Until the farmer Joe complained to us how he can't seem to reach the city to deliver his vegetables. 

Since then many tried to leave but it seems some force is turning them back towards the village. 

It had been like that for 3 days, then something nobody could have seen happened. 

On January 13th , someone went missing. 

The missing person was the Potter, Harry. He had a loving wife and a son. He disappeared without a trace. 

The rest of the village thought he found a way to escape and saw him as a traitor. 

Then it happened again on February 13th . This time it was the merchant, Bill. He used to live alone and didn't have any kids, he didn't leave a trace either. 

On March 13th . The son of Harry, James went missing. His mother was devasted, she told us that when she went to check on James midnight . there was a dark figure with red eyes on her window, it looked at her for a second before grinning and jumping off. There was no sign of it afterwards. 

The villagers immediately thought that it was a demon, the demon cursed the village. They thought that the wife was cursed because she saw the demon , they suggested to sacrifice her but the village was split whether to sacrifice her or not. The head of the village disagreed with sacrificing her. 

It was decided not to sacrifice her. 

On April 13th . The head of the village went missing. The villagers realised that he went missing because he opposed sacrificing the wife. Then the whole village sacrificed her by burning her alive. 

On May 13th . The sculptor, Nick went missing. Without any trace again. He had a sister, who seemed to go insane due to her loss. The villagers were fearing for their lives now. 

On June 12th. Nick's sister's body was found in her bedroom, looks like she died from a heart attack. 

That's where things took a turn, nobody went missing on June 13th.

The idea of sacrificing people to save others came to the villagers, but we could see that nobody had the courage to suggest it. 

By this time, The daughter of the deceased head of the village took lead and said that they won't be sacrificing anyone. 

On July 13th , She went missing. The villagers decided that they must sacrifice someone to save themselves. 

On August 12th , They decided Joe needed to be sacrificed because he was the first one to realise they couldn't leave. Joe refused to co-operate , so they forcefully buried him alive. 

On August 13th , Joe's wife went missing. The village was in chaos. Nobody knew why the sacrifice didn't work or what they should do. 

They decided that they mustn't sacrifice more people. 

Last month on September 13th . My friend, Dynal went missing. He was a chef and had a wife. I used to make kitchen knives for him and he occasionally invited me for dinner. 

It's October 13th in 3 days and everyone in the village has isolated themselves, praying they aren't next. 

I'm no different, I want to stop this but I'm just a mere weaponsmith. I don't know what I should do. HELP.

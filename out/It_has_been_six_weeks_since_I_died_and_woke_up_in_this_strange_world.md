 

I still have no idea how it happened or if it is even real but me dying is the only thing that makes since. The world I came from is a lot different, I am a lot different. There I was in constant pain, I spent nearly my whole life watching the world through my tv screen, the only time I left my apartment was for my weekly hospital appointment or to go to my local shop and that was only for emergencies, I usually got everything delivered. Every time I took one step outside the door, I was in constant fear, the slightest tip to the head could send me into a fit of convulsions. Once I went to the park and seen a group of teenagers playing soccer. The ball rolled over towards me, and they asked me to kick it back, I ended up kicking it into a thorn bush right in front of me. I tried to apologize, but they thought I had done it on purpose, and started giving me shit, the guy getting the ball bounced it off my head on the way back. To be fair to him I don’t think he noticed my scars and it was not hard, if it were anyone else, they would have barely felt it, but to me it was enough to put me in hospital for 3 months.  

I remember the night I died very vividly, I woke up feeling dizzy, then my whole body went weak, and my left side became numb, I was unable to move, I could feel myself start to drift away, I was sure that was it, but I did not care at least my suffering was over. Then I woke up here fit and healthy, no scars, no pain, I thought it was a miracle, until I started to notice things were not right. Cars were driving on the wrong side of the street and there is only one species of human here. There are many other differences, they have countless religions, most believe there is only one God, I found that so strange and fascinating, over the last few weeks I started visiting a few of these churches for research purposes, they all seem to go on blind faith alone, it's madness. I must admit it is a lot safer here, people even go out at night, once I even tried it myself, I was terrified the whole time, I thought they would come for me, even though I checked online first and apparently, they don’t exist here, I don’t think I would do it again though, just in case. 

The food is weird here too. I saw all kinds of commercials, where they were eating birds, I thought I was going to vomit, the main one they eat is something called a chicken, I don’t think it even flies, I suppose it makes it easier to catch. It is not all bad, they have cows, which look very similar to tarn but much smaller and the meat is less fatty, but their taste is the same. I don’t know what to make of this place, and I am still very skeptical, but I am getting used to this new, stronger, healthier me. Maybe this is limbo, and I am waiting to go to a better place or somehow, I could have drifted into some sort of alternate universe, or maybe it is something else, there idea of demons looks very similar to our gods there could be a connection there. Over the last few days, I sense changes coming, I have been having horrible nightmares, I believe they are telling me that I am not supposed to be here, well, at least my consciousness. My time is growing short, but I will not give up, I will keep taking notes and hopefully figure things out before it is too late.

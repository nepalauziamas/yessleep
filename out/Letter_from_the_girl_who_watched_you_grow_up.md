Hi,

The first time I saw you, I was surprised I could see you. You had a small turtle in your hands. You kept calling it Michaelangelo, which I assumed was a nod to the Ninja Turtles. You tossed your long, brown hair behind your back and knelt down to place the turtle on the ground. You were excited to see it wobbling on the grass. It reminded me of my cat and how I used to play with him when I was your age.

I witnessed your entire childhood from my small *window*. Your first ride on a bicycle. Your first day of school. Your first real friend Brenda. Your first day of middle school and the cute uniform you got to wear. The time you won the science fair and you brought home a trophy shaped like a cell. You were such a happy girl.

I saw you grow older. Your body changing. You grew taller, your body slimmer, your face as beautiful as ever. I witnessed as others started to notice you in a different way. The stares from the jealous girls. The googly eyes from the young boys. As all this happened before my eyes, I noticed myself changing too. I got older. I got weaker. I got disillusioned . Bruised. I lost my will to escape my painful life. All I had was this *window* to your life to keep me going.  I lived my days through yours. Watching you was enough entertainment for me. You couldn’t know the different ways you saved me from bad thoughts, bad days and all the pain I had been suffering from.

I saw the day that handsome young man came to pick you up in a red convertible. Your mother wasn’t happy about it, but she knew she had no choice. You had to start spreading your wings at some point. You left in a gorgeous floral dress that matched the summer’s flowers. You came back late that night. You had a stuffed bear and some leftover cotton candy. I imagined you had gone to the fair. I imagined all the rides you must have gone on. All the fun that must have been for you. I was so happy that you had enjoyed your first date. And then came the magical kiss. He leaned in, blushing, and kissed you. Your cheeks were so red that I instantly knew I had witnessed your first kiss. I closed my eyes, imagining what that must have felt like. For *one* second, I imagined it had been me wearing that dress, smiling so big, with butterflies in my belly and a kiss on my lips. But I was happy for you. 

I wanted to thank you for allowing me to live again. For allowing me to dream again. I wanted to thank you, but just couldn’t bring myself to you. I couldn’t go talk to you. I didn’t know how. If only you knew about my *window*.

And then, one day, I heard him talking about you. The man I live with. He noticed you. I heard him complaining about how pretty girls like you shouldn’t show off their legs like that. The moment he mentioned your legs, I knew it was over. I knew you would become his next trophy. I had to keep you away from him. This was my chance to thank you. I couldn’t let you turn into me.

I had been lucky. I don’t know why he liked me this much. Most other girls came and went, never to return. And yet, amidst all the years, he always kept me down here. I think it’s because he saw that I still had a light in me. Because I had *you*. All the other girls died long before he killed them. I could tell that they were already dead in their eyes long before he viciously murdered them in front of me, showing off his skill.

But not me. You kept me going. I had my little *window*. A little crack high up on the wall of this basement I call home. He didn’t like that he couldn’t break me down. He didn’t know about the little crack. So he kept me to see how long I could stay like this. It is a sick game... that I’ve been winning thanks to you.

But then... he noticed you. And I knew, I knew what fate awaited you if he laid his monstrous hands on you. Whatever strength I have left, I’ve collected it and prepared myself to finally do something about it.

I want to thank you. Because if you’re reading this letter, it means I did it. I gathered my courage, packed it neatly into action, and went through with my plan to escape once and for all. I will make him believe I’ve died. I don’t know if it’ll work. But if it does, he will reach to pick me up. I’ll immediately kick him as hard as I can where it’ll hurt the most. *As hard as I can*. I will then steal his keys and run as fast as I can and drop this letter off in your mailbox. I have a feeling he will chase me and get a hold of me eventually because I am weak... I’m very weak. Battered. There is barely a human left in this body of mine. But if that is the case, I’ve been prepared to leave this world for a long time. I doubt anyone will hear or see me. This street is so desolate. You’re the only life here it seems sometimes. But so long as you get this letter, I know that I did my part and that you’ll be safe. 

Monsters are real. This one is named Ryan Morehouse. He is your front door neighbor. I have been kept captive in his basement for a very long time. I’ve lost track of the years but I believe I must be in my late twenties by now. I was fifteen when he first brought me here. My parents must have looked for me. Please don’t tell them about me. I don’t want them to know about the tortures he put me through. I don’t want them to see me broken down this way. I just want you to report him to the police. His evil nature and depraved mind can only be stopped if he is caught behind bars. 

They will find bodies dangling in the walls of the basement. I’ve learned to live with  the smell by now but they will notice it the second they step down here. There are a lot of young girls in the walls of my room down here. Tell them to treat them delicately. They were good girls. They’ve been my companions. My friends. 

Most of all, I want to thank you. You’re the only thing that kept me going. You were my light. And now, I’m escaping thanks to you. Escaping this awful room. Escaping this awful life. Even if it means I finally get to die.

With love,

The girl who watched you grow up

We found this letter in our mailbox. After contacting the police, they entered the home of our neighbor across the street. Over a span of five days, they found a total of fifteen bodies hidden in different parts of his house. He had plans to kidnap our daughter, but thanks to this mysterious stranger, his plan was intercepted. We still have not found the girl who wrote this. We like to think she made it out alive, but, sadly, it isn’t likely as Ryan Morehouse is also missing. We don’t even know her name. But we did find the little crack in the wall, the one where she saw my daughter grow up from.

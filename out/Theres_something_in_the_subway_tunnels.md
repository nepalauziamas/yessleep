I used to live with a large group of people that used the abandoned train tunnels as a place to live, we had our own electricity, army, food supply, water source, and plumbing. It was pretty advanced for living in subway tunnels. Our army used scraps to put armor together, and they used old world war 2 era guns, some people took them apart and made their own guns. For safety reasons I won't be telling you where these tunnels were. When we started to get suspicious of something else in the tunnels, it was small stuff, a small burst pipe here, a tool missing there, small stuff. I was one of the first people to notice it and report it to the police. I gave the evidence straight to the chief because I had a sneaking suspicion that this was going to escalate exponentially. I was talking to the chief when he interrupted me and told me to get out of his office. I was confused on why he was mad at me, when he told me that it was a waste of his time. I left the police station and tried to tell the army the same thing but yet it was still a waste of everyone's time.

After a week this became more and more of a problem, it had gotten to the point that people were going missing, gas lines getting huge leaks. Eventually the police came to me because they saw me as helpful to their case. I said that I would help them but they have to make me the main investigator, but we settled on a secondary investigator. We started by investigating everyone's house in the tunnels to see if they were the ones stealing stuff, we found nothing. We then decided to look at the pipes, we found no prints, no scrapes from tools, no melting from a heater, we found nothing. We looked around the pipes to find bare footprints, human footprints. We tried to follow them but they eventually disappeared and we couldn't track them anymore.

We convinced our general to use a platoon to follow the direction of the prints. We geared up and set off, finding nothing along the way. About an hour into the walk we started hearing noises, they sounded like clicking with your tongue. The next sound we heard was what sounded like a scream, a blood curdling scream, mainly because it was somewhere in the uncanny valley. It sounded human but just a little off, we started to pick up the pace because if it was a human, then they might be in trouble. We reached the source of the clicking; an eight foot tall, faceless creature that only slightly resembled the figure of a human. It was skin and bones in the most literal way I can describe. Everyone stopped out of fear or amazement but one way or another, everyone stopped. This thing was on all fours and had small, bone-like protrusions on its head. Despite having no head, it was clicking, that's when the scream came again from further in the tunnel, that set off a chain reaction of one of the soldiers screaming. This caused the creature to turn to us and start swinging wildly, this caused the soldiers to start shooting the thing. The bullets barely affected it. After hundreds of rounds had been spent, the thing collapsed motionless.

After we killed it we turned around and started the walk back about halfway back. The scream was heard again, but this time it sounded like it was right on top of us. This causes everyone to turn around to see a 17 foot tall creature, not unlike the one that just died. Faceless massive, but this one had multiple arms and crawled on them like a spider. The soldiers started to aim their weapons quietly, that's when one of the privets let out a squeak out of fear or anxiety but that sound was loud enough for the things face to rim open to show a mouth right in the center of its face so it could let out a deafening scream. Me and the head investigator started running while the soldiers stayed and shot the damn thing.

We managed to get out of the tunnel and back to the settlement and warn the general so we could get a force big enough to take that thing down. One singular broken and bloodied private walked out of the darkness only to be grabbed by the head and pulled back into the darkness. The creature slowly crawled through the dark mouth still visible, but there were clear wounds to this thing's body. The general yelled to open fire causing this thing to let out another deafening scream. The entire army proceeded to shoot simultaneously but the creature was unfazed by the damage being dealt to its body. I told the general my plan to take this thing down, and after that he relayed it to his soldiers. My plan was to have someone lead the thing under the entrance to the tunnel where I would blow up the entrance causing it to cave in on top of the thing. I ran over to a soldier's corpse and took a grenade off of him. I told a soldier to run into the tunnel as I pulled the pin. The soldier started running and got it attention just as I let the spoon fly off and started counting. 1… it's turned around, 2… it's moving, 3… aim, and throw. The grenade arched below where I wanted but still blew up under the entrance causing the cave in. The rocks and debris fell on the creature causing it to scream once more until it abruptly cut out. We won, it was over.

Take note, if you hear uncanny screams, clicking, and/or deafening screams in subway tunnels, run and don't look back, move someplace else, pack your shit and go.

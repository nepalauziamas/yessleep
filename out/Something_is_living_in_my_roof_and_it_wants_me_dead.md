I live in this little shitty poor town in russia, nothings great here. My last family died in 1989, I’m not good with people so no friends either. I’m depressed and don’t know what I’m living for anymore, all I want is a friend or something to live for. This house has rats, bugs and all other shitty things you can imagine but what started last week is worse, way worse.

The power went off right before 11 pm. It were just a simple lose cable and I didn’t overthink it or anything but I got surprised when it happened a second time at exactly midnight. This time in turned right on again two minutes later.

Blood. A big puddle of blood in the sink. I couldn’t understand where it came from until I looked up to the ceiling, the blood is coming from the ceiling. I’ve had water leeks in the past but a blood leak was new. Rat blood? Human blood? My blood? I washed away the blood anxiously, with the thought of who’s blood it can be. 
 
More blood started appearing around the house, this time it were only drops or small puddles but definitely blood. I’m starting to think something lives in my ceiling, I’m scared of what could be next. The things are getting worse and worse by the day. 



Two days since the big blood leek and someone or something is talking to me. It started small with only small sounds or simple words but it quickly evolved to much deeper subjects, it was like it could read my brain. If I thought about anything deep like hurting myself or even killing myself it incurred it, telling me how I could do it or even that they would do it. I thought I were going crazy but I recorded it and it showed up so I’m not making it all up in my head. 
  

Two days have past and the talking has only gotten worse, I haven’t got any sleep for the last two days due to this dang voice. It keeps me up all night talking about deeper and deeper things. Then it said “last night buddy”, I think it’s going to kill me tomorrow.

The fucker tried, I barely saw it but they tried to stab me. I don’t know where it went, probably back to the roof. I can’t leave the house, I just can’t. I’m not myself anymore. Blood is everywhere and I don’t give a fuck about who it belongs to, I can’t recognize myself anymore. The voice isn’t back yet but I think it’s coming back soon. 

The voice is back and it just mumbles incoherent things, it seems like they are mostly mad but also sad and frustrated.
Everything has stopped working but I don’t care if the freezing temperatures kill me or the lack of food. Life is pointless at this point. All I do is lay in bed and write, this is probably the last thing I’m ever going to write.

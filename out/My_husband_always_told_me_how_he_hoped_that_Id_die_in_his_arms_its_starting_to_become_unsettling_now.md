 I am sitting in the lobby of the police station writing this out, trying to make sense of this whole thing, so bear with me.

Hello, I (37F) have been married to my husband (42M) for a little over a year now, he has been previously married to three other women, all of his marriages ended the same. They died in some weird or bizarre way.

His first wife, who he married straight out of high school passed away about two years after they got married, she was in an accident with one of those commercial trucks you see on highways sometimes.

His second wife who he married not long after his first wife passed away, they had been friends for a while he told me. They were married for less than a year but had dated for a while before she died giving birth to his only child, her name is Natilie (12F). Ironically enough, she is compared a lot to me, people ask us constantly if she's my biological daughter, and being fair, she looks like she could be mine.

Moving onto his third wife, who he married by the time he was 37, he tells me a lot about her, so does Natilie. The way him and her described it to me, the way she died, was that she had food poisoning, but then had complications with the food poisoning, and died in the hospital that same evening.

Now there's me. We've been dating since about a year after wife #3 passed away, and we got married last year, we were always very close during our dating stages, and he was the one to propose to me. He actually proposed to me when we were about a year into the relationship, but I was still nervous about the whole "all his wives died" thing and told him I wasn't ready yet.

He accepted my answer, even though he was a bit butthurt for a while. we got married not too long after we got engaged, it was a nice decent wedding, and I think the venue cost the most, considering my dress, the food, and the DJ. My dress was my mother's dress, she had always mentioned to me as a little girl how she wanted me to wear it when I got married. My husband didn't like the idea for some odd reason, and offered an older looking dress, it looked used, and when I asked about it, he said it was his previous wives dress, and that he wanted me to marry him in it, after a lot of bickering, we finally settled on me wearing my mother's dress.

Back to the story, my husband always told me that he wanted me to die in his arms, because he didn't have the opportunity to with his previous wives, since they all died without him present. He always told me I'd be the wife he'd never let go of, which was cute at the time, but now I'm starting to rethink those words.

My husband has been very jealous lately, though I just thought of it to be newlywed stuff, however it's starting to get out of hand, especially after we found out I was pregnant.

He won't let me leave the house without him, it never was a problem until we married, if I wanted to go out with friends, or out with Natilie to do some bonding stuff, he always had to come with me. It's gotten so bad he's been following me to the grocery store or on errands I run throughout the day.

If you think that's weird however, I personally think the incident that took the cake was when I left the house without him, he was at work, and just went to go get something from my car, when my phone pinged notifying me someone had texted me.

**NOTIFICATION** *"Where are you going?*"

That's the moment my heart dropped. The moment I realized he was constantly keeping an eye on me...but why?

Well, that's what I'm here to talk about, today's events.

This morning started out like any normal day, the normal events, though I had planned on going through the attic to get rid of some old things, and look through some of Natilie's old baby clothes, I came across a dusty old box and out of curiosity, I opened it.

I saw pictures of other women, who I presumed to be his wives but there was something strange about them.

They all look *exactly* like me.

Now I know this sounds crazy, but I'm being serious, these three women all looked like they could be related to me, they looked like me at different ages. It was kind of strange and creepy if I'm being honest. Then I found it. The pictures that will forever haunt me for the rest of my being, that just *told* me I had to get out of there. Now.

There was a little bag full of pictures of those girls, their skin was pale, and their eyes seemed to be glued open or something. But they were all pictures of them, some with only one girl, some with two and some with all three. The room the picture had been taken in seemed familiar. Then it hit me.

That was our house, OUR basement. I dropped the pictures in horror, I wanted to throw up, and I wanted to scream, but nothing came out. How do you even begin to process this stuff?! I put the box away, exactly where it was. Walked down the steps and closed the attic entrance. I tried to act as normal as possible, but my husband wasn't home, and I guess curiosity got the best of me, because I eventually got the courage to go down there.

My husband always told me not to go down into the basement when he wasn't home, he told me it was "always messy" and that it wasn't for me to see, but I went down there anyways, and as the door creaked open, I was definitely not expecting to see what I saw.

There was a desk, and a chair, with a dusty old computer placed on the top. But God it smelled awful down there. I didn't think much of it at first, even though I continued to snoop around, the smell was becoming more and more unbearable until I found the source. Four human sized crates were sitting up against the wall, three of them had people in them. People who looked exactly like me. His wives. I was so scared when I started reading the name tags on the top of the crates, each with numbers.

"1..2..3.." I stopped at the number above the empty crate, I knew this wasn't looking good, I stepped back, running away from the crates and towards the stairs, but something pulled me backwards, whoever it was, was holding on tightly to me, I couldn't recognize who it was behind me until i heard their voice

"I always knew you'd die in my arms, darling" 

I froze. It was my husband, all I remember was my vision going blurry, before I woke up in a hospital bed, with my stepdaughter waiting for me to wake up. I asked her about her father; however, she wouldn’t say anything about him. 

After I had recovered, and we made sure my son was alright, they brought me to the police station, where I am now to tell me what happened to my husband. 

Apparently, he had attacked me, even though I had no recollection of it, and that Natilie had heard my screams for help and called the police out of fear, and that if she hadn’t me and my son probably would’ve died. 

He was arrested at the scene they said, and they found the well-preserved corpses of his previous wives, and that he was probably planning on killing me soon as well to add to his twisted collection.

I’m sitting here now, trying to process all of this, I always knew something was strange about him… but I never could’ve imagined he’d be that twisted.

Are you familiar with how the Komodo dragon hunts its prey?

The answer is both simple and complex, depending on how deeply you look.

The simple answer is that they kill their prey with venom. Most will accept that answer and move on, content they know the answer, never questioning, wondering, if *perhaps* there is something more.

Fools. And some wonder how they get caught in my web so easily.

For the wise, there is always another step.

Unlike many venemous snakes, whose venoms are often quick acting, the Komodo dragon takes a very different approach.

It stalks its prey, silent as the death it brings. Then, the strike. A lightning fast lunge accompanied by a bite from vicious teeth. And then?

It stops.

The prey flees.

And believes itself to have escaped. All is not well, however. Over the course of twenty four hours, the venom works its way through the prey's body, weakening it, stealing the vigor from its limbs, and the breath from its lungs. Until finally, it collapses and dies. And all the while the Komodo has followed it, waiting in leisure until its meal is ready.

I am like the Komodo dragon. I give you what you want, and then you go. You leave and think you have escaped. But all the while I wait in the shadows, ever watching, always patient, for when your life implodes like a dying star. And then, like the venemous Komodo, I consume my prey.

There is no other outcome. None of you has, and none of you *will* escape me, once ensnared. You will take my offerings with glee, certain that *you*, of all those who have accepted my faustian bargain, will be fine. That you, out of all those hapless saps, are endowed with the cleverness to defeat me. *That* is true arrogance. Pure foolishness. *Unadulterated stupidity*.

You should avoid me at all costs. You should run. You should run and never, ever, *ever* look back. But you never do what you should, instead, you let yourself be led by the nose by your pointless wants and meaningless desires, as a mouse is led to it's death by a piece of cheese that would last it less than a day.

Fear me, for I am the bell that tolls for you. Fear me, for I am the ruination of all that is good. Fear me, for I am *despair.*

This time I was summoned to a very traditional location. An abandoned warehouse. You could tell the summoner had put a lot of effort into this. There were candles, laid out in special patterns, designed to induce placidity into the demonic. Spells had been cast throughout the room, protective measures to sap the strength of entities besides for the caster. There were even two circles, drawn with proper binding runes to hold the summoned creature and force them to obey any contracts placed on them. All of this was, of course, completely useless to one such as me. I did not appear in the circle prepared for me, which was placed opposite my summoner, who stood in his circle, clutching a book open to the Ritual he had used to bring me here. He stared at me, pale and shaking, as I walked around the room examining the wardings.

He was terrified, of course, but there seemed something more here. Something I could use. I peeked into his mind, glimpsed into the pitiful thing that was his soul. I saw his goals, his plans, and I chuckled. I saw the cracks of his mind, the fractures, and I laughed. I knew the fate that held him, the doom, and I roared in delight. After withdrawing, I decided to put some more effort into this one. I'm not normally one for the dramatic, but I knew if I handled it just right, I wouldn't have to do a thing to bring the fool to his ruination.

The deal went smoothly - for me, that is. I poked him in just the right ways. A little here, a little there, and then? It went exactly as planned. What did he ask for, you wonder? What did I do? Well, here's his Memories.

Why don't you have a look for yourself?

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I spent hours drawing those wardings. And the thing had just *ignored* them. I clenched my eyes tightly, staring at the creature as it studied my work. Finally, it turned towards me slowly. Dark eyes gleamed at me from underneath the shadow of a tall top hat. He smiled, an evil smile, filled with the glee of dark things, and the promise of twisted horrors. I shuddered. He vanished suddenly, black smoke streaming towards from me from the spot he had just inhabited. The candles extinguished themselves in an instant, leaving the warehouse in darkness. The smoke twisted around me, swirled by my ears, and I heard a soft sibilant voice whisper to me.

"***What do you desire, foolish child.****"* I took a deep breath to steady myself. It didn't work. I had lost control of this situation as quickly as it had been created. The smoke moved again, swirling out and upward in a tornado of darkness, roaring laughter echoing around me. I could see it somehow, even though there was no light left in the room. Everything was in complete darkness, yet I could still *see* it's shape as it twisted and turned. It spun in the air before shooting down in front of me, forming the loose shape of a man made of shadows, and holding out a hand.

"**Wish you for immortality?"** The words echoed in the emptey warehouse. **"Life to last an eternity? To watch as the sun dies? The earth ground to dust?"**

The figure beckoned once with it's hand before dissolving back into the shadows, shooting behind me and reforming. I turned to find the figure, that despite the lack of light in the room, appeared as a shadow cast upon the wall. It held out a hand.

"**Wish you for riches? To have everything that can be bought? To want for nothing?"** The shadow suddenly seemed to be atop a vast hoard of wealth, seated in a throne. It beckoned once more, and then stood up from it's throne. It stepped forwards out of the wall.

**"Wish you for love? To have a companion for all your days? To have a family?"**

A second shadow swirled upwards from the ground, taking the vague shape of a woman. The woman stayed for a moment, before collapsing in a snap of the figure's finger. The figure stood silent a moment.

"**All these things and more, I can give you. All you need to do is take my hand. So, I ask again."** The creature dissolved once more, returning to twist around me again.

***"What,"*** The Dealmaker asked. ***"Do you desire?"***

My nerves were roaring at me to run, to escape the horror wrapped around me. To ignore all the sacrifies I had made to find the Dealmaker, to give up my dreams of finally having control. I breathed quickly, fear stealing my breath and the warmth from my body, leaving me cold and trembling. My blood froze. It took me many minutes to gather myself. Finally, I managed.

"I wish," I paused, wetting my parched lips. "I wish to be able to bend others to my will. Their bodies mine to command." I looked directly at the smoky tendril. "I will pay anything you ask." A dark chuckle emanated from the depths of the shadow. There was the sound of a loud thunderclap and the smoke vanished. The candles were lit again. The man who had first appeared, was standing in front of me. Skin a deathly pallor, black hair. A twinkle of red embers in those deep black eyes. A dark trenchcoat made of hard angles. And a white glove extended towards me, and there, resting on a too cold hand, was a stone. It was completely normal, except for a small purple gem embedded in the top. I took it in trembling hands, gazing at it in awe.

**"There are a few rules."** The Dealmaker's voice brought me out of my silent reverie.

"What rules? Why are there rules?! You said you could give me anything!" I demanded, forgetting my fear for a moment in my outrage. The Dealmaker stared at me calmly, and my fear returned, quieting my anger.

**"There are a few rules."** He repeated. **"Firstly, to use the stone, you must simply hold it in your hand when you make a command. Secondly, you may only have five people under your complete control at any time. Lastly, you may only give commands to people you can see. Someone who is given an order and leaves your sight will still fulfill their command. But try to give an order with, say a letter or cellular device, and nothing will happen."**

I seethed. There was nothing for me to do however. "What do you want in return for the stone?" I asked, fearful of his answer. The Dealmaker held out his hand again, and I reflexively clutched the stone to my chest.

**"You must shake my hand. I require nothing other than this."** Suspicion filled me. Why does he want me to shake his hand? That's it? That doesn't make any sense! There has to be something more. Something I don't understand. What would shaking his hand do to me? I shook my head mutely. The Dealmaker leaned in clode, until our noses almost touched.

**"You can shake my hand,"** He said, his voice was a thin veil of calm over a bubbling rage. I could hear voices coming from that deep anger. They whispered to me, promises of terrible things, threats of tortures that made me want to be sick. I felt the blood drain from my face. **"Or you can give me back the stone."**

I shook his hand, pushing aside my deep suspicions for the moment. I would *not* give up my dreams now. The Dealmaker's face was suddenly twisted with a wide, toothy, triumphant grin before fading away, and I immediately regretted shaking his hand. His glee filled me with unease, and a powerful feeling that I had just been taken for a ride.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I left the warehouse, still shaking slightly. Could I trust the stone? What had been the purpose of the handshake? I felt dread, certain he must have taken *something* from me. The worst of it was, I had no idea what was missing, if there even *was* something missing. Perhaps he hadn't taken anything, and I had instead given my permission for something else. These thoughts swirled around my head in circles, twisting and turning and making my fear compound and multiply. My thoughts were broken, however, by the welcome sound of my friends' voices.

"Harry! How'd it go in that creepy room of yours?" John shouted. He and Moe were leaning against the car, having a smoke while they waited for me to complete the Ritual. I smiled, my fear withdrawing at the sight of them. I closed the distance between us before answering. There was no need to shout this for everyone to hear.

I motioned for John to be quieter. "It went well." Moe raised his eybrows.

"Seen the wee ghostie have you?" There was enough sarcasm in his voice to sink a boat. I snorted.

"As a matter of fact Moe, I have, and you shouldn't call him that. He might be listening." My revelation seemed to shock Moe, and he paled a little. Evidently he hadn't quite believed me. I held up my right hand in a fist, before opening it and showing the two of them the stone. They stared at it silently for a moment. John looked up first.

"And this little thing will let you..?" He hesitated.

"Control people, yes." I grimaced. "But it has annoying limits. We'll have to make do with it. The plan should still work." John and Moe exchanged glances.

"Listen, Harry. We've been thinking." Moe began slowly. "Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, your plan it's...ambitious. The whole city? Are you really sure you can do it?" I sighed. We had been over this before, but it didn't surprise me they had brought it up again. It *was* ambitious. Some would say too much so, but I say they are fools. I motioned for them to get in the car. I didn't want anyone to overhear us. I didn't *think* the Gold Ghosts, the gang I had joined, were following me, but I just couldn't risk it. Once we were in, I told John to start driving, before I finally answered Moe's question.

"Yes, Moe. I think *we* can do it. With you two at my side, and with this stone, the gangs of this city will be ours. It won't be easy, but I believe we have the wits, the strength, and the sheer guts to pull this off. We get work our way through the Gold Ghosts until our position is strong enough to pull a coup. Then some more direct confrontation with the Royals until we control them too. With both of the biggest gangs under our control, the smaller gangs will fall into place with just a little pressure. When we're done, we'll *run* **\[REDACTED\]**. All crime will go through *us*, all the cops will answer to *us*, and all the politicians will be *ours*, bought and paid for. *We can do this!*" As I spoke, I could see the two of them begin to see the future I was weaving for them, could see them imagining the life I described. "Anything we want, we can have. It'll all be just a phone call away. Everything in this city, every car, every store, every single damn dollar will be ours for the taking!" I could see in their eyes that they believed me, and I knew there would be no more questions about the plan. Our next stop was nearby, so by the time I finished, we had arrived.

"Let's go," I said, smiling and opening the door to exit the car. "We have a city to conquer."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A spark of flame on a match lit the darkness briefly in flickering light.

The light darkened as the match was shoved into a pipe in an attempt to light it.

No smoke rose as the pipe remained unlit.

The flame extinguished.

The light gone.

Failure.

I sighed and reached for another match.

"That thing'll kill you, you know." John mentioned in an offhand voice, his voice an annoyance as I concentrated on trying to light my pipe. I let out a soft curse as another match went out. The damp night air was doing my efforts no favors.

"Gets into your lungs, burns 'em something awful," John continued. "Really ruins 'em." I persevered. I was so close. I just had to give it one more try... with trembling hands I moved the match closer to the bowl of my pipe. I took a deep breath and focused on keeping my hands as still as possible—

"But that's not what kills you." My focus shattered and I dropped the match. "What kills you is when it makes blood clots, which give you a heart attack." I glared at John

"I swear, if you don't shut up John, *I'll* kill *you*." I snapped. John looked back at me, amused but silent. Without his impromptu health lesson, I managed to light my pipe succesfully. After giving me a few moments with my pipe, John spoke up again.

"A pipe? Really Harry? Who smokes a pipe these days..."

"Call me an old soul." I muttered. He snorted at that, and leaned back against the car we were waiting by. The car was parked by the side of the road, near a hub for delivery drivers. Our target would be here any minute. At that moment my burner phone rang. I grabbed it and answered.

"Yeah?" I asked

"Target should be there in five." Moe spoke quickly. "You ready?" I fingered the stone in my pocket, turning it over and over in my hands.

"Yeah." I answered. "Yeah we're ready." I hung up the phone.

"Let's go." I said to John. He jumped into the car and started the engine. I got into the passenger side and pullet out the siren and lights, reaching out the side window and fixing them to the roof of the car. Normally we wouldn't impersonate an officer so casually. But with my new stone, I had a feeling nobody would find out. A few minutes later, a truck loaded with branded t-shirts rolled by us. We pulled after them, sirens wailing and lights blazing. A moment later, the truck saw us and began to pull over.

I got out of the car and walked over to the nervous looking driver. When he saw I wasn't wearing a uniform, his face turned confused. Then it turned angry. I quickly pulled out the stone.

**"Wait."** I commanded. The driver immediately froze. **"We're going to make a little detour. There is nothing wrong. I'm going to go with you inside the truck."** The driver's face went blank for a moment, then became happy. Although, for a brief moment, I could have sworn he had given a small creepy looking smile. It was only for a moment. I shook my head, clearing the disturbing image from my head. It was late, and the lack of sleep was playing tricks on my mind.

I went around the side, and got into the truck. After telling the driver where to go, I sat back as he calmly drove to the dropoff point. When we reached it, Moe and John were waiting, ready to unload the truck. With the drivers help we got the entire contents of the truck into our warehouse. After it was done, I turned to the driver.

**"Go back to your route. You will forget everything that happened."** Once again his face turned bank, then calm. And once again I thought I saw the flash of a smile. It worried me a bit, but I pushed it out of my mind, probably just nerves. The whole thing had only taken an hour. It was insane! And we had no tracks to wrroy about, the driver wouldn't remember a thing. I turned to Moe and John with a smile on my face.

"We did it." The two were clearly surprised.

"I can't believe it." Moe muttered. "It was so *easy*."

"And you're sure there won't be any problems?" John's voice was concerned.

"Absolutely." I shook my head a little, barely able to believe it myself. "He'll go back with no explanation about why his whole truck is empty. They'll fire him, maybe think he went dirty, or just horrifyingly incompetent. Either way, they can't keep him on. So they'll fire him. And in a day or two, I'll wipe the commands."

"Won't he tell them once he remembers?" John asked.

I shrugged. "Doesn't matter. They won't believe him. Him coming to them with some crazy story with fake police and a guy who could make him do whatever he asked? A few days after he was fired, and he he had no explanation at the time? No, he can say whatever he wants. It doesn't matter. We're clear, boys. Done. The job's clean."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

My report on the job was very well recieved by my superiors. Three men taking an entire shipment with no struggles and no trail left a very appealing image of our capabilites to the higher ups in the Gold Ghosts. Though we were new members, we began to recieve more jobs to pull off. With the stone, they were easy to do, and our reputation in the gang continued to rise. We had a perfect record. Never a scratch. Never any difficulties. And never any trail. To the gang, we were golden.

Eventually we found ourselves in a meeting with one of the heads of the gang, Jacob Mageo, a crime boss operating under the top man of the Golden Ghosts, Charlie Singh. Jacob was Somoan and a giant of a man, six and half feet tall with golden tanned skin and more muscles than I could count. His stature and musculature lead to many underestimating his intelligence, which was useful to him— and a fatal mistake to everyone else.

At the moment he sat looking us over as we sat across from him at his desk. After a moment he spoke, his voice deep and rumbling. "You've done quite well for yourselves at our little group."

"Thank you." I responded hesitantly. He nodded slowly, deep in thought.

"We have a job for you, one that likely surpasses your...admirable talents." He held out a stalling hand to prevent me from interrupting. "Just listen. You are not required to accept. We have a source that tells us that the Royals plan to raid one of our storehouses tomorrow night. They will outnumber you. The only advantage you will have is they do not know that we know. Still. It is highly unlikely you would be able to stop them. We can afford to lose this shipment. But we would rather not. If you would accept this job, I would expect you to fail. But if you don't..." Jacob let the word hang for a moment, before giving us a wolfish grin. "Well, that would be quite the accomplishment. Someone who could pull such an operation off would go far in Golden Ghosts. Very far." He paused and let us stew for a moment, considering his words. He had all but given us a promise of a promotion and likely more. Completing this would give us more power in the gang and just as importantly, respect. Both of which would be vital for our plans. After giving us a few minutes he spoke. "Well, gentlemen? Do I have your answer?"

I looked up slowly, meeting his eyes and holding them for a moment. Then I let my smile match his.

"Oh yes. We'll do it. See you in a few days."

He laughed.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

We decided to set up a few areas wich we could use as cover in an attack. We would only need a few moments of protection. Then I could use the stone on them and it would be over. I laughed to myself. This would be just as easy as the truck jobs. As the night progressed me, John, and Moe ran a few patrols around the warehouse, but we weren't too concerned. After all, there was no we could mess up. This job, and the success that would follow, were practically already ours.

At around two in morning, the three of us sat around playing cards. I was close to winning I was sure of it. I was sitting on a straight flush. It was between me and John, Moe having already folded. It was the final round. My turn to bet. I stared hard at John. So far he had followed my lead, matching me for every bet.Finally, I pushed my remaining money into the large pile in the center."All in." John gave a lazy smile, before pushing in his own small pile. I gave a triumphant grin back, flipping my cards over.

"Straight flush!" I crowed, and reached for the pot. John's hand grabbed my wrist, holding me. I stopped and hesitated.

John flipped over his own cards. "Mine." I stared, before letting out a loud string of curses. He had a royal flush, the bastard. Moe chuckled as John began to laugh at my stunned expression. He threw his whole body into it, head thrown back as he let loose.

The bullet hit him right in the forehead.

The laughter stopped. The chair which had been tipping backwards, fell with a crash and John's body sprawled lifeless to the floor. I stood frozen, before jerking backwards in my chair. I felt a bullet whiz by my ear. I dove behind one of the blocks we had set up. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Moe do the same. Once safely behind covor, I peeked over the top, and finally saw my attackers. Five Royals entering the room, handguns out and ready as they entered in an even spread formation. But the number didn't matter. Because they were within my sight.

**"Stop."** I said. They froze. It was over then. I breathed a sigh of relief, which turned into a sob halfway through. John was dead. *They had killed John!* Rage and shame mixed in my chest. It was partly my fault. If I hadn't been so careless, so *stupid* John would still be alive. But I wouldn't take all the blame. These sons of bitches had played their part as well. The anger overcame my shame, and a walked away from my shelter and towards the still frozen Royals. Moe came out as well, the same anger that boiled my blood burned in his face. As I gazed on the Royals my rage cooled, and turned dark. I narrowed my eyes. They didn't deserve the time it would take for me to kill them. So I let them do it.

**"Kill yourselves."** One simple sentence. As I watched their faces turned blank, and then they raised their guns to their heads, and fired. I watched in horror. Not because of what I'd done. They deserved their fate. The horror that gripped me came from what I had seen in their faces right before they died. The all had the same twisted smile, only for a moment before going blank. I couldn't ignore it this time. What the hell was going on? What had the Dealmaker done to me? What had I done by shaking his hand? My thoughts were interupted by Moe's hand grabbing my shoulder. I looked up and saw the sadness in his eyes and remembered once again, grief ripping through my heart.

John was dead.

I looked into Moe's eyes and took a deep ragged breath. "This ends tonight."

Moe shook his head slowly. "It's too quick. In order to pull this off, the Ghosts need to know that we succeeded."

I squeezed my eyes shut. "*Damnit.*" He was right. "Fine. One week. Then we seize control." I let out a sigh. "For John."

Moe nodded in agreement. "For John."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I did not sleep the night before the first half of my plan would come to fruition. Instead I sat on the edge of my bad staring at the stone as I turned it over and over in my fingers, the same thought running through my head over and over. Had someone betrayed me? I went over and over the the last mission in my head as the stone flipped. I hadn't thought the Royals would come so early in the morning. And they shouldn't have known we had anyone watching the warehouse. Jacob had said as much. I paused, the stone halted it's movement.

Had Jacob lied? Set us up? Perhaps. If he thought we were rising too fast, maybe thought we were coming for his position?

Was it Jacob? Was it the Dealmaker? Was the stone cursed? Is that why he wouldn't accept anything? I clenched my eyes shut as unbidden, the memory of those horrifiying smiles rose in my mind. Their faces slack except for those evil little smiles, empty soulles eyes rolling at me...I shuddered. They were another reason for my sleepless nights.

Another thought crept in from some dark part of my mind, someplace I didn't recognize as me.

*Was it Moe?*

I rejected the thought as soon as it came. Why would he do such a thing?

Slowly, slithering the voice came back.

*He's jealous of you...*

I frowned. That made no sense, why would he—

\*Because when you succeed, you will be king, and he will be nothing...\*The voice whispered.

*No,* I shook my head trying to it of these poisonous thoughts. Moe had been a faithful friend for years. He wouldn't have betrayed me now. Even if he would he would never had had John killed.

I sighed.

No.

I knew whose fault John's death was. It was mine. The stone had made me reckless. Just because the Royals didn't know we would be there doesn't mean they wouldn't have been cautious. No, all these thoughts were just me trying to excape the guilt. Trying to escape the grief. My head dropped into my hands.

I couldn't believe he was dead. It just didn't seem real. It was always going to be the three of us, me John and Moe at the top. Together. And now...now we would have to do it without him.

Once again I cursed myself for being so damn reckless, I hadn't even set a lookout. I was so reliant on the stone. I cursed the day I had gotten the stone. Why had I been so stupid? There was obviously something wrong with it, why else wouldn't there have been a price? His name is the *Deal*maker, yet if he asked for nothing, how was this a deal? He must *get* something out of this, but what??

Right then, the door banged open, and Moe barged in. He looked at me for a long moment, before he tossed me my pistol.

"It's go time."

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

The two of us walked through the office building that served as the headquarters to the Golden Ghosts. Moe filled me in on the situation as we walked.

"It's the perfect time, Charlie Singh's in there, meeting with a rep for the Royals. Falls right into our plans!" I nodded in agreement. The Royals had sent someone, likely to offer terms for a truce. They would be underpowered after losing so many full members in one night.

A minute later, we turned a corner and saw two Ghosts guarding the door to the office of Charlie Singh, mob boss extraordinare, head of the entire Golden Ghosts operation. I smiled. Soon there would be a new name in that spot.

I walked right up to the two guards, who tensed as I approached, my hand in my pocket fingering the stone. I didn't slow down as I approached.

**"Leave."** I commanded as I walked up to the door, forcing myself not looking at their faces to avoid seeing the twisted smile I knew would be there. I knew the element of surprise was vital for this next part, so I allowed no time to pass. As soon as I gave the command, I kicked the door open.

There was a moment of silence as three faces turned to me. One was a young kid, presumedly the Royals rep, they wouldn't want to send anyone too important in case of an...accident. The second was Jacob Mageo, who was there to offer his advice. And lastly, Charlie Singh, a small New Zealander with clever hands and an even more clever mind. All three completely different people, all three with identical expressions of surprise.

Once again, I wasted no time. In a single moment I aimed and fired, putting a bullet right between Charlie's eyes. The Royals kid still didn't move, but Jacob was faster. He had a gun in his hands and was halfway towards me when—

**"Stop!"** My order came out, sharp and quick it snapped like a bullwhip, freezing the two members. I looked at the kid for a moment.

**"Go back to the Royals. Tell them there's a new leader of the Golden Ghosts. And tell them there will be no peace."** He nodded, and I was too slow to turn my head, and I saw that terrible smile once again. It took me a second to recover, before I turned to Jacob.

**"I am your new leader . You will support and obey me completely. You will help me smooth out this takeover."** He too nodded, and I gritted my teeth as that damned smile flickered over his face.

"We did it." Moe's soft voice cam from behind me. I turned to find him leaning in the doorway. A gentle smile on his face.

"We did part one." I corrected, but I couldn't prevent the smile that broke over my face. It was crazy to think how far we had come over the last few months. And it was all because of the stone. It had made all of this not only possible, but *easy*. And yet I still hated it. Because even though I was finally close to achieveing everything I had set out to do, John wasn't here. I knew it was my own recklesness that killed him, but that recklessness came from the stone.

I closed my eyes, as the memory of John made even this great victory feel hollow.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

"Three dead, and another five were injured in the latest attack." Jacobs voice was calm, measured. It didn't fit at all with the shitshow he was describing. I sat back in my new desk. It had been two weeks since my takeover, and my war with the Royals. The takeover, with the help of Jacob as well as the respect I had earned by pulling off difficult missions, had gone smoothly. I was the undisputed leader of the Golden Ghosts. The war, on the other hand, was not going nearly as well. Most of the difficulty lay in the particulars of how I needed to win. I needed to break them enough for me to take control, but not so much that they were destroyed as a force in **\[REDACTED\]**. The line was thin, but I needed to walk it perfectly. I sighed.

"What about the meeting with the Sixthers?" I asked tiredly. One of my ideas was to recruit one of the many smaller gangs to perform a hit or two. It was hard to convince any of them to do so however, as they were generally wary of working for the Ghosts or the Royals out of fear of losing their independance. Getting them to perform an actual hit on one of us was damn near impossible, since they would be worried about becoming a target themselves. Somehow I needed to find a way to do so in order to break the current stalemate.

Jacob nodded. "They want to meet in an hour in their warehouse. I have the location and a driver ready to go."

I jumped forward in my seat. "What? That's insane! That's gives us basically no time!"

"That is the point, I believe. They don't want us to prepare anything. Small as they are they want all the advantages." Jacob replied. I sighed again. That made sense.

I stood up. "Alright, let's go then." Jacob lead me out the door. I motioned for Moe, who was standing outside the door to follow as well. Jacob led me to outside to the waiting car. It was a small car, nondescript. It was intended to be ignored. A kid, one of the newer Ghosts seemed to be working on something in the engine. When he saw us, he fiddled with something a little before closing the hood, grabbing a tool bag and leaving. Moe went to the car and opened the door for me.

He's not dead in case you're wondering. Although the more astute of you will have realized this since the title *does* say part one. But this is where we will stop for the moment. Harry's story is not yet done, indeed we have taken only the first step, laying the foundation, showing his rise to power. I will return with the second part at a later date, to finish the tale. To tell you of the broken man at the end of the story. How the cracks began to grow and widen until it all just...fell apart.

Until then however, I bid you farewell.

May your dreams be nightmares, and nothing but pale reflections of your daily life.

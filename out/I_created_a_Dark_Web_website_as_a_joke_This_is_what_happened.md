Hello, everyone. Im here to tell my story. Back in the day, when the creepypasta community was way bigger than now, i wanted to hussle in. I decided to create a site, i will not give you the name, if you are into creepypasta, you most likely have run into it. So i was i college then, i gathered some money, created the site. I paid freelancers to build me just the right site and published it. Saved some money and spent it on advertisement, got traffic, everything started to work out. When i had enough traffic, i decided to run some ads on my website, and boy did i make money. I made some good cash back then. 

We were running the website with my girlfriend and my friend. My friend started a youtube channel, where he narrated the stories, hence another source of cash. 

At that time we were able to work on it full time, it paid well. But as you know, nothing is forever. Gradually, we started to lose traffic, people moved on, but we kept on. We continued to work hard just to keep whatever we had. Even that got smaller overtime. 

Sitting in front of my laptop one night, i was thinking of a way to gain the traffic back. That’s when i had the dumpest idea ever. I decided to make a fake deep web site, spread the word and get people to my website once again. 

So you wander what was my idea about? Let me tell you. I decided to create a deep web site, that will look as a personal diary of an amateur serial killer, and i wanted to make it seem real. I sat up a Nginx server pointed  Tor to it, everything took no more than an evening. This didnt mean to be just another creepypasta, i wanted to make a post about it on my main website, i knew people will be interested in something like this. 

So that’s what i did. I created the site. And i did nasty stuff. I will post some of the entries i posted on the dark web site as i proceed with my story.

Entry 1:

“I feel so aroused. I could smell her perfume. I could hear her breathe. She had no idea i was there. I was walking in the woods, close, but not close enough to the road. Just enough to be able to see or even feel her. She was walking home alone. I wanted her right there. I wanted to get out of the shadows and strike. I wanted to have her all helpless under the weight of my body. The screams and the unsuccessful attempts to escape would only arouse me more. I would look her right in the eyes as i kill her, making sure to tell her that i will have a lot of fun with her body after she dies. But today, i couldn’t. I just couldn’t do it. I wanted to. I know im ready, i know i need to. But today i couldn’t do it. Wish me luck next time. I will strike for the first time very soon!”

I even took a picture of my girlfriend walking at night, made it shaky and everything. It was legit, i tell you. Then after posting the fake post on a dark web blog, i made a shocking post on my main website, saying that i have found this creepy blog with one entry. I posted it. The people loved it. Discussions were raging on reddit, discord, my site’s comments, everywhere. People created groups dedicated to find this creep and put him behind bars. For some time i was scared it would lead back to me but it didn’t. After a week, i created the second entry. 

Entry 2:

“I started small. I don't regret it. Everyone has to start somewhere. Today I killed a cat. I would share a picture of what I did to it, but it’s too personal for me now, I don't want to share. 

I saw it near my house and  I immediately knew it has wandered here just to be killed. I took it inside my garage, gave it some food and hit it with a knife just when it was least expecting it. The feeling. I cannot describe the feeling. In fact, it’s a bit silly, but I even ejaculated while I was killing it. I tried to have the same experience again by hitting its dead body, but it didn’t work. Nothing’s like the real deal. That’s I can tell you. Now I know what I was made for. I can feel that it's my calling. Moving to people next time, stay tuned!”

For this entry I just used a weird angled photo of a garage floor with some cranberry sauce we made look like blood on it. 

Again, I created a post on my main website and again, the traffic was so hooked. The story got so big, it even appeared on TV. I was on top of my game again. The profit from the ads skyrocketed. Me, my girlfriend and my friend, we are were so happy about this little thing we came up with. 

The stakes were higher now, the next post had to get really graphic. We all knew it. That’s why we decided to wait, we couldn’t come up with anything. We tried to maintain the interest for these entries. 

And life moved on. We  never made the third post. We had the momentum, we got to 15m unique users a month. We kept entertaining our readers with other stuff or fake leads about this story. The decision was made to not create another post unless it’s really necessary. 

One morning, after a couple of months, i logged into my main website and noticed a weird spark of activity. The threads were full of comments. Something big has got to happen. Interested to find out what was going on, i checked all the comment, just to find that a third entry has indeed been published. On the dark web blog that i have created, and it was not posted by me. 

I ran Tor and opened the site. This is what i found:  
Entry 3:

“Sorry it took so long for me to post an update. As you can see, i was busy. I finally did what i have been wanting all this time. I will tell you what happened. I was out last night, just wanted to watch someone. I have my spots, were i wait, hoping that a lone stranger will end up walking by. Sometimes i spend the whole night and nothing happens. Last night was different. Just after i arrived i saw a girl. She was walking alone, crying. She was so into her head she didn’t notice that i have been walking behind her this whole time. Just at the right place, where the road had many bushes on both sides i rushed towards her, put my hand on her mouth from behind and dragged her off road. 

This was fun. First i felt rage. Not towards the girl, no. I was mad it took so long to actually happen. I started hitting her, then, when she was almost unconscious i unzipped my pants and entered inside her. I killed her while being inside. Can’t really tell you how good it felt. Sharing some goodies this time.”

The post had an image attached to it. It was the image of the dead girl. I will not going to describe the image, it still hounts me  to this day. 

Hoping it could be some sort of a fake, created by my girlfriend or my friend, I decided to call them. Although, deep inside i knew it couldnt be any of them, as they had to access to the site. I still called and made sure. They didn’t know anything about it. 

At once, it was no more fun. I was terrified. Someone has accessed the website. And they killed, for real now. Millions of thoughts were bombarding my brain, all at once. Who is it? Did they really kill that girl? Why would someone hack and post it on my site? What if they find i created it? What if i go down for this murder?

I couldn’t show any activity on my main website, couldn’t participate in discussions. I didn’t know what to do. Later that day, me, my girlfriend and my friend met. We talked about what happened and convinced me that i was safe and should act normal. 

All of that went right out the window the next day, because there was another entry:

Entry 4:

“I expected more coverage from my fans on \[the name of my main website\]. I’m very disappointed. Maybe i didn’t do good? Maybe i should kill again, so im interesting enough again? Let’s see.”

Whoever it was, they were paying close attention to my main website, thus it’s fair to assume they know i created the fake dark web site they were using to post their killings now. I don’t know what to do. I need any advice. I want to go to he police but im afraid i will end up in jail. What do they want with me? Why did the do it? So many questions and not enough time for me to think about the answers…

Chelsea cornered me during the seventh period, standing with her hands on her hips like she was gearing herself up to pick a fight. Thanks to the messy way our relationship had unraveled last year, it was a familiar sight. Luckily, I already knew what she was mad about. “I’ll turn in my part of the Lit presentation later,” I said hastily, even though I had no intention whatsoever of working on it tonight.

“Wait, Chloe, that’s not what--”

I ignored her and escaped outside, heading straight to Marlee’s house. For the longest time, school had been the only thing that really mattered to me, more than even my friends. I’d planned on graduating as valedictorian, going to an Ivy League school, and getting into a T14 law school. I’d wanted to make my family proud. And I still wanted that, but for the first time since Marlee’s death, I felt like I could breathe again.

Marlee’s house was huge, with wide arched windows that let you peer into their living room, and a sprawling driveway. With a sinking feeling in my stomach, I realized that it looked completely empty. Neither of her parents’ cars were in the driveway, and there was an unmistakable air of neglect. The grass in their front yard had grown to ankle height, and aside from the distant buzz of a neighbor’s lawn mower, it was completely silent.

Even so, I tried knocking on the front door and checked under the doormat where they had used to hide their key. No one responded, and the key was gone. I wasn’t going to let that stop me though. The memory of Marlee’s phone call should have been distant and unreal to me, like something out of a nightmare, but instead, it was gaining clarity with every passing minute. I went to the massive black walnut tree growing beside Marlee’s bedroom and dumped my backpack to the ground.

After a few minutes spent steeling myself, I began to climb. The last time I’d entered her bedroom via this route, I’d been much younger and weighed a whole lot less. I tried to focus only on finding the next handhold or foothold and not on how far away the ground appeared. Granted, I wasn’t that far up, but I hated, hated, *hated* heights.

Halfway across the branch that led directly to Marlee’s window, it dipped under my weight. I shrieked, picturing myself tumbling head over heels, catching dizzying glimpses of the cloudless sky and ground until I smacked into the ground with a hard thud, breaking my neck. *Just like Marlee*, screamed my mind. I wasted ten minutes taking one heaving gasp after another before I could finally inch forward again. Marlee’s window latch was broken, a fact that Marlee had exploited to great advantage. I had a bad moment, wondering whether her parents had fixed it, but then it slid open under my groping hands.

I tumbled into her bedroom inelegantly, narrowly missing thumping my head against the sharp corner of her desk. As I looked around the bedroom, a familiar pang of grief stabbed through me. Her parents hadn’t changed anything. There was the silly Sailor Moon poster she’d plastered above her dresser when we were kids, and the row of misshapen mugs all three of us had made in art class during our freshman year. The tiny stuffed dog I’d given her in ninth grade rested on her light pink duvet cover, his fur grey instead of white and rubbed away in patches. She’d clipped photos of us on her string lights, which bordered the space above her bed’s wooden headboard in a Z. Twenty or thirty Marlees beamed at me, all of them impossibly young. Impossibly alive.

It took everything in me not to burst into tears. *Focus*, I told myself. There would be world enough and time later to feel guilty. Right now, I had to figure out whether or not there was anything in her bedroom that might help me find her murderer. I started with the desk, since it was conveniently nearby, and opened the drawers one after another. I rifled through old school assignments and folders full of old readings. I even got on my hands and knees to check under the desk and bed. I didn’t find anything there, or anything in her dresser or walk-in closet. The latter had been crammed full of piles of shoes, some of them still in their unopened shoe boxes; Marlee had never gotten to wear them anywhere. I slammed the closet door shut a little too hard.

I was about to investigate her nightstand next when the sound of footsteps reached me. I froze. I hadn’t heard a car pulling in, but it had to be one of Marlee’s parents. They’d always thought so highly of me, believing that I was a good influence on their daughter. What would they say if they caught me here? What would *I* say to them? I threw a frantic glance at the bedroom window, desperately wondering whether I had enough time to make it out. What was the right choice? Did I stay or did I go?

The doorknob jiggled and began to turn. The decision had been taken out of my hands. So, I took the only course of action left to me: I threw myself down to the ground and wriggled under Marlee’s queen-sized bed. I didn’t stop until I was pressed up against the wall, my heart pounding. A thick layer of dust was underneath me and I had to clamp both hands over my nose to stifle the incoming sneeze.

The door swung open and someone walked inside, the wooden floor creaking noisily under their weight. I turned my head enough to see a pair of Converses. It wasn’t Marlee’s parents after all; neither of them would be caught dead wearing those sneakers. So...who was in the bedroom with me? On the heels of that thought came a swift answer: whoever had murdered Marlee. I tried to dismiss the idea, to tell myself that it didn’t make any sense for her killer to just waltz into her bedroom in the middle of the day, but--what if they knew that they had some loose ends to tie up?

Fear surged through me. I could hear them moving around the room, but I didn’t understand what they were doing at first. Not until a stack of papers exploded into the air and drifted to the floor like leaves. Whoever this person was, they were searching her room, just as I had. An essay Marlee had written about *Wuthering Heights* fluttered next to me, her bubbly script filling the lined notebook paper, and I remembered how much she’d loved that book. I felt the first stirrings of anger, and I welcomed it. Being angry was so much better than being afraid.

A plan slowly formed in my mind. I would take a photo of whoever was here and call 911. If I caught them off guard, maybe I’d have enough time to get inside of Marlee’s parents’ bedroom and barricade the door while I waited for the cops. I couldn’t just hide under the bed until they’d left; their presence in her bedroom right now was a sign that *something* was here. Something important. Decision made, I started to army crawl out from underneath the bed, trying to move as slowly as possible to stop the wooden floor from creaking under my weight.

And that was when I saw it.

Marlee had jammed a black Android phone between the mattress and the wooden slats of her bed frame. It was two inches above me and to my right. I knew right away that it wasn’t the phone Marlee had regularly used; that one was an iPhone with a lavender case that depicted frolicking Pusheen cats. I swallowed hard. *This* was what I had been looking for, even if I hadn’t known it. I reached out to yank it free, my heart hammering away in my chest.

Suddenly, my phone vibrated in my jacket pocket, as loud as a gunshot in the silence. My mind went blank with horror. Although I usually carried pepper spray with me, I’d stowed it away in my backpack. And my backpack was outside. It might as well have been on the moon for all the good it’d do me.

A familiar voice said, incredulously, “What the fuck?”

“Colton!” I squirmed out from under the bed and clambered to my feet, hardly able to believe my own eyes. He stood next to Marlee’s desk, looking as stunned as I felt. I’d been so sure that Marlee’s killer was in the room with me that I was having difficulty shifting gears and coming to terms with Colton’s presence. Unless--no way, Colton loved Marlee. I couldn’t imagine him hurting her. More to the point, he’d been at Vee’s party the night she died. I was sure of it.

“Chloe, what the hell are you doing here?”

I belatedly realized that there was dust smeared all over the front and back of my shirt, and that my hair had gotten loose from the bun I’d tied it up in. I probably looked like a complete mess. I fought not to feel like a kid who’d just been caught with her hand in the cookie jar; he had as much of a right to be here as I did, which was to say, *no right whatsoever*. I raised my chin and said coolly, “I could ask you the same. Why are you going through Marlee’s things?”

His ears turned bright red and he looked down, seemingly engrossed with the lumpy mug on Marlee’s desk. I crossed my arms and glared at him until he groaned and said, “I’m sorry! I should’ve told you sooner. She called me last night too.”

“*What*?”

“I thought it was a dream! I mean, smoking too much weed always gives me really weird dreams. But then you said that you had a call from her too, and it got me thinking--”

“Un-fucking-believable!” I paced around Marlee’s bedroom, trying to ignore the fact that, buried beneath the indignation and anger, there was the sharp sting of jealousy. Again. I should’ve known better than to think Marlee had called only me; she’d never liked choosing between the two of us. “And you tried to tell me that I was delusional!”

“I’m sorry!”

“Yeah right, you are! What did she say to you?”

He held up his hands in a pleading gesture. “Just--that I should help you. She said, ‘Help her.’ And that was it. And I went back to sleep. Chloe, I know I fucked up. I’m so sorry. It was like 3 AM and I thought it was just a nightmare--” He looked sincerely contrite, his dark brown eyes huge and pleading.

“Apology *not* accepted,” I snarled, although I had to admit that there was a tiny part of me that was relieved I wouldn’t be searching for Marlee’s murderer by myself. “How did you even get inside?”

“Marlee keeps, kept, a spare key buried near the black walnut tree. She used it all the time to get back inside after staying out late, remember?”

No, I wanted to snap. I had to force myself to take several deep breaths before I could say, “For the record, I’m still pissed off at you. But we’re going to work on this together. No more secrets between us, okay?” I waited for his nod before leaning down and grabbing Marlee’s hidden phone from underneath the bed. “I found this.”

“Seriously?” His mouth dropped open. “Holy shit!”

“Don’t get too excited,” I warned him. “I don’t even know if it’ll turn on.” He crowded up against me while I found the power button, and I was acutely aware of the smell of his cologne. *Get a grip, Chloe!* I’d been forcibly ignoring my crush on him for months and I wasn’t going to stop ignoring it now.

“It’s almost out of battery. Do you have any idea what the PIN could be?”

I knew her other phone’s PIN: 2-0-0-4, her birth year. But I didn’t think she’d have used the same PIN for this phone; she’d hidden it from her family, even from us. When I closed my eyes to think, I heard her voice again: *I loved him. And he murdered me.* Seven little words, precise and emotionless, dropped into the vast distance between us like stones into a still lake.

The phone chirped in my hands and died. “Fuck!”

“It’s okay,” said Colton hastily. “We can wait for it to charge. Let’s get out of here.”

“Right. Let’s go to my place. My mom’s staying over at Stephen’s tonight.” With luck, we’d have all night to crack this phone. I might not have been there for Marlee while she’d been alive, but I was here now. And nothing was going to stop me from finding answers.

\*\*\*\*

Digging through the mess of wires and chargers in my desk drawer gave me plenty of time to regret inviting Colton over. I hadn’t cleaned my bedroom in weeks. Clothes covered every surface and my Chinese homework had somehow multiplied and colonized my desk. I was supposed to be working on the AP Lit project with Chelsea, comparing *Measure for Measure* with one of its film adaptations, but I kept sneaking glances over at Marlee’s phone instead.

Unlike Marlee, I’d never liked reading books that much. I didn’t have the attention span for them. But for a while, Marlee and I had both loved reading Nancy Drew books. And in those books, Nancy and her friends always found a smoking gun that tied up the book’s mystery into a neat little bow. I already knew that it wasn’t going to be that simple for us.

Chelsea had sent the text that had tipped Colton off to my hiding place under Marlee’s bed. She’d written, “Can we talk? It’s important and you need to know.” I still hadn’t responded yet. I didn’t feel capable of thinking about anything other than Marlee’s death right now.

*What were you hiding, Marlee?* Why *were you hiding?* Marlee had once told me that she envied the freedom Mom gave me, and I’d given her an outraged stare in response. Yeah, my mom did give me a lot of freedom, but that was because she had me at eighteen and was trying to make up for lost time. Time she had spent taking care of me instead of getting to be a kid herself. What Marlee never got was that sometimes I *wanted* my mom to behave like a mother, to tell me off for sleeping too late or eating out too much. I didn’t want her to be my best friend all the time. I understood why Marlee had hidden this from her parents. But why from us?

Colton abandoned his own attempt at homework and sighed. He hadn’t completed a single math problem on his worksheet. “So, Stephen,” he said. “Uh, is that the guy with the neck tattoo? The one who always walked around your house shirtless?”

I laughed despite myself. “No, that was Myron. Stephen seems nice, actually. He’s a surgeon at O’Connor.” Mom had been an HR assistant at O’Connor for nearly six years. Last night, she’d come back home humming and looking happier than I’d ever seen her. I didn’t bother telling Colton how glad I was that she’d found someone better than Myron and better than the last five ex-boyfriends before that. Hopefully Myron would get the message eventually; I’d seen him sulking in the convenience store opposite our apartment a few times already.

“Hey, it’s at three percent!” Connor fumbled for the phone, nearly pulling its battery cord out of the outlet in his haste.

We silently waited through the agonizingly slow start-up process, and then the phone prompted us to enter the PIN. We’d have, at most, three attempts to solve it before it reset itself and deleted all of its data. “Any ideas?” I asked, biting my lip in thought. As if the stakes weren’t high enough already...

“Let’s try 2-0-0-4?”

He gave me the phone and I carefully entered the PIN, already knowing it wouldn’t work. The phone vibrated in my hand and INCORRECT PIN flashed across the screen. We had only two attempts left. “We’re missing something obvious,” I said.

I thought back to all I knew about Marlee. Not just the superficial stuff, like the fact that her favorite color was red and her pet peeve was people who cut in line, but the core of who she was. It hurt to remember her like that; I didn’t want to admit even to myself that she wasn’t coming back.

Marlee...Marlee was fearless. She wasn’t afraid to push boundaries or call other people’s bullshit out. At the same time, she was a hopeless romantic, someone who believed in love at first sight. Her dream had been to attend UCLA and to eventually teach nineteenth-century English literature to university students. She loved books like *Wuthering Heights*, *Jane Eyre*, and *Pride and Prejudice.* Sometimes, late at night, she’d whisper to me about how much her parents disapproved of her. How much they wished I was their daughter instead. Like so many other Taiwanese immigrants, Marlee’s parents believed that higher education was the key to success. But they wanted their daughter on the doctor, lawyer, or engineer track. They didn’t want her to be a teacher.

Wait a second. Literature. “Wait,” I said. “Let me try something.” I Googled the publication date of *Wuthering Heights* and entered the numbers into her phone, practically vibrating out of my skin with anticipation.

1-8-4-7.

The screen stayed blank, and I momentarily thought I’d wasted one of our two attempts. Then, the PHONE IS STARTING notification flashed across the screen. “Yes!” Colton grinned at me, slinging his arm around me in a quick side hug.

The first thing I noticed was that Marlee’s phone didn’t have any apps downloaded on it, aside from the default Phone and Messages apps. The second thing I noticed was that she had nine missed calls, all of them from the same number. “Do you recognize it?” I asked Colton, unsurprised when he shook his head.

Aside from a handful of other calls from that same number, the phone log didn’t offer any other clues. Whoever called Marlee must not have liked talking on the phone often or for very long. I opened the Messages app next and breathed out a sigh of relief.

Jackpot.

“Whoa,” said Colton softly.

There had to be hundreds of messages in there, sent at all times of the day and night. Most of the texts were straightforward, setting up times, dates, and places to meet up at, but others were silly and sentimental, or flirty and graphic. He’d called her his Cathy, and she’d referred to him as her Heathcliff. It simultaneously made me cringe and miss her more than ever. I kept scrolling and reading until I reached the top. Marlie had sent her first message to this number nearly two years ago.

**Marlene:** Hey.

**555-0199:** Don’t tell anyone I gave you this number. I could get in a lot of trouble for this.

**Marlene:** Don’t worry.

**Marlene:** Your secret’s safe with me.

**Marlene:** When/where do you want to meet?

**555-0199:** After sixth period. Parking Lot B.

Parking Lot B! I turned to Colton and saw the same stunned realization in his eyes. “Parking Lot B is the *staff* parking lot!” I jumped up to my feet, unable to stay still a second longer. “He must be a teacher--no wonder she never told us about him!”

“I can’t believe it,” he said, still shaking his head. He looked more upset than I’d ever seen him.

“Should we bring this to the police? They can probably figure out who it is, right?”

Colton raised his eyebrows. “And say what? We’re jumping to conclusions. We don’t know for sure that this belongs to a teacher. And even if it does, we don’t know which one.”

I opened my mouth to argue, but I couldn’t deny that he had a point. The evidence here was flimsy and circumstantial at best. If we brought this to the police station, would they even take us seriously? *Officer, I know that the coroner wrote “suicide” on our friend’s death certificate, but she called us last night from the afterlife and told us she was murdered.* Right. That’d probably get me 5150ed.

“What about the other thing she told you? Something about two mouths?”

“Two smiles,” I corrected him. “I mean, I *think* that’s what she said. There were all these like, weird noises in the background.” No matter how long we puzzled over those two words though, neither of us could figure what Marlee had meant. The excitement of successfully opening her phone drained away from me. Why hadn’t Marlee simply said her murderer’s name during the phone call? Or had she, and I’d missed it? The idea that whoever had hurt might walk free, that he might get away with what he’d done to her, was unthinkable.

“It’ll be okay,” said Colton, apparently noticing my frustration. “We’ll figure this out.”

“I miss her so much,” I whispered. “Like whenever something dumb or funny happens, I want to text her. But I *can’t*. And then I remember all over again that she’s gone and not coming back, and it feels like a kick to my stomach every time. And I feel so guilty all the time. It doesn’t make sense why she would’ve killed herself!” My voice rose uncontrollably with every additional word.

Colton tugged me into his arms and started rubbing comforting circles against my back. “I miss her too, Chloe. I think about her every day.” His hand was so warm. I turned to look at him. We were close enough that I could see the freckles dotting his face. Close enough to kiss. And then we *were* kissing, because I’d surged forward and wrapped one hand into his shirt to pull him down.

He kissed me back, but only for a few seconds. “Chloe, I can’t.”

I felt like someone had just dumped a bucket full of freezing water over me. “Oh,” I said stupidly, swallowing a howl of protest. “Right, that makes sense.”

“It’s not that I don’t want to,” he said quickly, like that was supposed to make me feel any better. “It’s not, um, I mean, you’re cute and--our friendship means a lot to me--”

Oh my god, he was letting me down gently. “You don’t have to say anything else! I get it. Seriously.” I picked at a cuticle on my thumb to avoid making eye contact, my face burning with humiliation.

There was a beat of awful silence. Then, Colton cleared his throat. “Right. Uh, I should get going. My parents are probably wondering why I skipped soccer practice.”

“Makes sense,” I managed to reply.

“See you around.”

I waited until I heard the front door slam before throwing myself onto my bed, wanting nothing more than to erase the last few seconds from my head. I’d known that Colton would reject me, and I knew all the reasons we’d never have worked out in a million years, *so why had I kissed him anyway?* Except I knew the answer to that too. Because I’d missed Marlee so much in that moment that I’d blindly reached out to the only other person there, the only other person who’d known her and loved her as much as I did.

If Marlee had still been here, I could’ve texted her about this. I was pretty sure that she’d known about my crush on Colton; she would’ve shown up with a pint of Rocky Road ice cream in one hand and a bottle of Baileys in the other. Despite myself, I replayed the kiss again. The kiss I’d fantasized about for months. *How am I going to look Colton in the eye tomorrow?*

I’d thought I would spend all night tossing and turning, replaying our kiss until I wanted to smother myself with my pillow. But instead, I fell asleep right away, although I didn’t realize I *was* asleep at first. I wanted to see Marlee so badly that that was what my brain gave me. Dreaming about Marlee wasn’t out of the ordinary, but most of my dreams about her tended to be memories. Like the time we went to the carnival two towns over and I won her the stuffed dog toy sitting on her bed. Or the time we woke up at dawn and drove to the beach without Colton. We’d spent the whole time talking as the stars slowly disappeared and the sun set the ocean on fire with red and orange and pink.

This dream was different. I dreamt that we were at Vee’s beach party, the one that Marlee hadn’t made it to because she’d been hitting the water at 60 mph while I’d been pouring myself a refill from the beer keg. In my dream, Marlee and I stood close to the bonfire on the beach, holding red Solo cups filled to the brim with vodka and seltzer. There was a full moon and it shone brightly enough that I could see other kids standing in bunches near the bonfire or at the picnic tables. When I squinted, I thought I could even make out some kids skinny-dipping in the ocean. Someone was playing music loudly, a wild, looping melody paired with loud drumbeats that vibrated in my chest.

Impulsively, I hugged Marlee, so glad to see her here. The fire glittered in her eyes and her long black hair kept sticking to my face. I breathed her in, wanting to hold onto this moment forever. “I miss you so much,” I whispered.

She grinned back at me and slurred, “I miss you too. Come on, let’s go into the water!”

Unease crept down my spine. “No, that’s not a good idea,” I said, trying to tug her towards the picnic tables. I looked around for Colton, but I couldn’t see him anywhere. He might’ve been somewhere out of sight though, making out with a girl in the parking lot or just beyond one of the sand dunes.

Marlee laughed, that same joyous laugh I remembered so well. “Don’t be such a chicken!” She ducked out of my grasp and ran towards the waves, throwing her Solo cup to the ground. It rolled and came to a stop against a dark tangle of seaweed. I ran after her, suddenly terrified. I knew that she had to stay out of the water, but it was like running in quicksand. For every three steps she took, I could only manage one.

“Marlee!” I yelled. “Marlee, wait! Don’t go in there!”

She ignored me, diving into the water with a splash. I went in after her until the water reached my chin. I couldn’t see her anywhere at all. The ocean lifted me off my feet and drew me inexorably away from the shore. I spluttered as a wave washed over me, the taste of salt clinging to my lips.

“Chloe.”

I turned around and nearly screamed. Marlee had been standing right behind me, oddly still. She was unsmiling now, and her eyes were big and solemn, the eyes of a child praying before bed. “Please find him,” she said, barely audible over the music still playing on the beach. “I’m worried for you.”

“What? What are you talking about?”

She opened her mouth to respond and froze, frowning. Suddenly, she vomited water.

“MARLEE!” I went to her and she clutched onto my arm, a strange rattling noise coming from her throat. “Just hang on, I’ll--HELP! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP US!” But none of the kids on the beach turned around. The party kept going and the music got louder, drowning out my screams. “It’s going to be okay,” I promised. “Marlee, it’s going--”

Her neck snapped in half with a sharp cracking sound, her head lolling down to the left. And in a matter of seconds, she began to decay rapidly. Her skin loosened and fell away in patches. Her body bloated grotesquely to twice her normal size, inflating like a balloon. From out of nowhere, a vast cloud of blowflies enveloped her, some of them landing on me. I shrieked and tried fruitlessly to tug myself free from her grip. But she wouldn’t let go. And I had to watch from up close as maggots squirmed out from her eye sockets and ears and mouth, devouring the flesh from her face. They left behind a shriveled, blackened skull that leered emptily at me.

Abruptly, her discolored, still-swollen body burst wide open, like a bag that had been filled too tightly. Unnameable fluids drenched me. Her corpse blackened and shrunk until she became only a skeleton wrapped in tattered rags of skin. And still her skeletal fingers clutched onto my arm, so cold that they burned against my skin. We’d drifted further away from the beach, and I could barely keep my head above water now.

Finally, mercifully, the dream began to dissolve. She spoke to me one last time, her voice emanating from her skeleton, as emotionless and relentless as the waves beating against the shore.

I’ve had a complicated relationship with my mother for many years, but that didn’t make it any easier when I got news of her passing. If anything, it made it harder to swallow. I hadn’t seen her in years, and the guilt of having abandoned her on top of the grief of losing her – at the loss of a relationship I didn’t even really *have* – was almost too much to bear. My father passed when I was just moving into adulthood, was just moving out of the house, and I was the only child of a family with little to no familial connections.

Because I am the last surviving member of my family, I was naturally the one to shoulder the burden of cleaning up my childhood home. This task on its own is far from easy – physically or emotionally – but I had a lot more on my plate than most, seeing as my mother was a hoarder. She wasn’t always that way, but she began demonstrating some pretty concerning behaviors soon after my father passed away… a strange, and – frankly – disgusting manifestation of her grief.

I first noticed something was off with my mother when I returned from college to spend my winter break with her and found our home, normally so neat and orderly, completely disheveled. I’ve always been a bit of a stickler for cleanliness, so I did most of the housekeeping… but the mother I knew wouldn’t have allowed the house to deteriorate like I saw that day. I waded through half a foot of trash layered on the floor to find dishes piled up in and around the kitchen sink, heaps of papers stacked high in the living room, and food scattered around each room in various states of decay.

My mother was sheepish about the whole thing, but when pressed she broke down, revealing that it started because she couldn’t stand to get rid of anything my father had ever touched. She couldn’t wash any dish he’d used, and she even brought in all of his files and paperwork from his office. It was clear she was in a great deal of emotional distress, her pain so great that it manifested somatically. She complained of a sharp pain in her neck, a haze clouding her mind.

I felt so sorry for her, but by the end of the short month I’d spent there, the underlying motivation for her hoarding behavior had clearly moved beyond grieving my father. She’d rifle through neighbors’ trash cans in the evenings, pulling cartons of spoiled milk, discarded leftovers, and whatever papers she could find and bring them inside the house. Worst of all was the buzzing, the droning sounds of the flies that had infested the house, preying on my mother’s miserable mess.

“I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” she’d cry as she scattered the papers on the floor, dispersed the food throughout the house. “I don’t know what I’m doing – or why – but I just… I just know I *have* to do it.”

I wish I could say I was more compassionate than I was, but being in that house… it *changed* me. When I returned home for the summer, I hoped that she would have returned to her usual self. I quickly learned that this was incredibly misguided – she’d only gotten worse. I was hit by the stench of rotting meat, sour milk, and just… *filth* as soon as I entered. I couldn’t even get past the entryway, cluttered from floor to ceiling with garbage. And, again, the buzzing was so loud I could barely concentrate.

I made it clear that I would not be staying with her if she intended to keep the house in such a state, that she needed serious *help*, but she would hear none of it. She even flat out denied hearing the buzzing sounds at all, even as they drowned out her words and forced her to raise her voice, all in the name of maintaining her hoard.

It really is like what they say – one man’s trash is another man’s treasure. It just so happened that *all* trash was treasure in the eyes of my mother.  

And so, I left. I reached out over the years, tried to get her the help she so desperately needed, but she rejected me time and time again. I ended up growing apart from her and developed some extreme thought processes around cleanliness myself, magnifying my already tidy nature to an unhealthy level. Essentially, I became the polar opposite of her – all surfaces had to be sanitized several times per day, floors swept and mopped, everything hidden away so that no sign of daily, normal life could be found within the four walls of my apartment. I feared that I would end up like her, living in a castle of filth, if I allowed my tidying to slip even slightly.

So, needless to say… I was not excited about the job ahead of me at my late mother’s house. I could’ve hired a cleaner, but my standard of clean is difficult to achieve. It made me anxious to think about what someone else would overlook – would they sanitize under the soap dish in the shower? Would the baseboards be dusted once, twice, three times over? Would I find a single paper crumpled up under the bed, behind the bookshelf? It was clear that I couldn’t trust anyone else to do the job, so I had to do it myself.

The putrid smell was even more nauseating than the last time I’d visited over ten years ago, hitting me yards before I even reached the front door. I tightened my face mask, which helped only marginally, and unlocked the door. It took a considerable amount of effort just to force it open; I had to lean my weight into the door to compact the trash behind it just enough to slip inside.

The look of the place was even worse than I could have possibly imagined. A layer of crumpled papers several feet high completely obscured the floor. Every surface within sight was cluttered with piles of decomposing food. Fruits and vegetables lay browning and molded, some partially liquefying into puddles of dark muck. Discarded bones were dispersed throughout the disarray, with chunks of rotting meat still attached. Maggots writhed over the decaying mess, burrowing in and out of holes. And, again… worst of all was that overwhelming droning sound, the buzzing of the flies that hung like a twitching dark curtain over the rooms.

I breathed a sigh of frustration, contemplated just turning on my heels and getting the fuck out of there, but settled on getting to work instead. I can’t stand the sight of a mess, and once I knew just how dire the situation truly was, I couldn’t leave it there and reasonably expect for it to just leave my mind. When I say it took day after day of tireless labor, I mean just that. I got a hotel room nearby, unable to sleep in the house as I aired out the stench and chucked every last piece of shit in the dumpsters I’d rented.

As the mess was progressively cleared out, so did the swarm of flies. I put up fly tape to catch any of the insects that continued to linger even after I’d cut off their supply. Overall, I was growing more and more pleased with my work with each passing day, until the last of the trash was finally disposed of and number of flies dwindled down to just a few here and there. The place would be considered to be in good shape by most folks. Of course, though, that wasn’t good enough for me.

I returned to the house early to start a deeper clean, the kind of clean that I’m used to doing at my own place. Surveying the fly tape, I was satisfied to note that the last hangers on had fallen victim to the trap. It was the first time I wasn’t constantly swatting while working, and I was pleased to work without the perpetual disruption. I was about halfway through bleaching and scrubbing the grout in the bathroom tiles when I noticed the sound again, a low and constant *bzzzzzzz*.

I’m honestly not sure if it ever even went away, or if I’d just grown accustomed to it. The thought drove a shiver down my spine.

Whipping my head around, I searched for the source of the noise, but failed to spot a single fly in the room. I forced myself to ignore it as I put my brush back to the grout. But even as I scrubbed faster and harder, hoping that the sound of stiff bristles moving back and forth against rough grout would drown out the sound, it was undeniable. The low droning sound was *still there*. If anything, it was only growing louder. Eye twitching, I recalled – with great annoyance – the times my mother had responded with willful ignorance to my complaints of the buzzing sound when it was clear as day, so *irritating* and *disgusting.*

I put on some music to give my mind something – *anything* – else to focus on. Thankfully, I was able to get the next few hours of work done this way, but I’d clicked through the volume until it was maxed out by late afternoon. My initial suspicions were right – the droning was only getting louder, more fervent, more aggressive… like whatever unseen force causing the sound was *angry* at me.

Unable to ignore the sounds for a second longer, I tore through the house, suspecting that I’d missed a rotted peach or left some chicken bone somewhere… though it seemed unlikely considering my meticulous cleaning approach. Of course, there was absolutely nothing left behind, not even my own *sanity* at that point as I pulled at my hair, my eyes brimming with tears as the *bzzzzzzzz* only grew louder. I fell to the floor in anguish, propping my back up against the wall of my late mother’s bedroom to rest my aching body.

That’s when I felt it, a gentle vibration tickling my back, the low hum even louder in such close proximity to the wall. I put two and two together, then… it was my greatest fear, realized. The insects were holed up *inside* the walls.

A dread overwhelmed my senses as I turned to press my ear against the wall; a sudden crescendo of the noise confirmed my horrific theory. I could practically feel the disgusting creatures teeming, bumping into and crawling around each other through the confined space. The idea made my skin crawl, but I forced myself up off the floor to move along the wall, dragging my open palm against the surface as I listened intently. The thrumming sounds escalated as I traced the wall from the bedroom and into the hallway. The vibration feeding into my hand rapidly intensified as I moved down the hall and into the living room, the droning sound almost deafening.

Gazing down, I noticed a small hole a few feet above the baseboard, something I’d overlooked in the chaos of the original mess. I leaned over to squint my eye against the hole, the buzzing so loud that it drowned out my thoughts completely, and saw only a flurry of movement, the flit of a pair of wings. I recoiled instinctively – both out of fear and disgust – as the plaster surrounding the hole began to crack.

Then, all at once, the wall exploded outwards.

I scrambled back desperately as an enormous swarm of flying insects released into the room, their collective droning somehow even infinitely louder without the insulation of the wall to muffle the noise. The horde of massive bugs flitted about the room with a disturbing synchrony, as if silently communicating a plan of movement down to the millisecond. Frantically swatting the pests away, I stumbled forward, stopping dead in my tracks as the inside of the wall came into view.

A colossal honeycomb pattern had been laid from floor to ceiling, seemingly constructed from some brown, paper-like material. My stomach lurched as I realized what I’d stumbled upon – not a swarm of flies, but an oversized nest of sorts. A wasp’s nest, but not like any I’d ever seen before.

Instantly, I threw my arms over my face and neck to shield myself from the stinging swarm. Several moments passed, and, surprisingly… the attack didn’t come. Once I worked up the courage to pull my hands from my eyes, the reason for their passive response became clear. A gargantuan, bloated wasp – the size of a brick – lay in one of the gaping holes studding the nest. Immediately, I understood it to be the queen.

My thoughts raced, though my body remained still as the queen began to flap her wings. Her enormous, inky black eyes locked on mine as she closed the distance between us, bobbing down every so often as her fragile wings struggled to carry her heft. The moments dragged on, excruciatingly slow, until she finally buried the length of her giant stinger in the back of my neck, inciting an eruption of pain. I lost consciousness as the sharp projection pierced three or four inches into my flesh.

I’m not exactly sure how long I was out for – everything’s still a little hazy – but I woke up to total darkness. The sound is still here, but it’s changed… I hesitate to say this, but it’s almost *comforting,* like how my mom used to hold me close and hum softly to help me fall asleep. Even stranger still, I’ve caught myself with the urge to bring in some of the spoiled food, some of the crumpled paper from the full dumpsters outside.

This sudden, overwhelming impulse leaves me torn between retrieval and disposal, between hoarding and obsessive cleanliness. This internal battle has raged on for hours, and I find myself exhausted – *weakened* – by the turmoil. I… I feel so sorry for my mother, now, feel so guilty that she had to struggle with this oppressive *need* for so many years all on her own. Because, try as I might to ward off this novel urge to hoard food and nesting materials for the horde of insects… I know that, as soon as I’m finished typing this up, I’ll get up and go to the dumpsters. I know I’ll return with armfuls of putrid meat, with scraps of paper soaked in the liquefied remains of rotted fruit.

I know this is what I’ll do, because I know now that I don’t have a choice. I know now that I *have* [to do it](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

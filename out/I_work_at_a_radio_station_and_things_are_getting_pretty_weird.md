 Talking directly from the city on the edge of the world, a beautiful and sweet place where you would surely want to spend your vacations. A nice city, with a kind, also suspicious, neighborhood; a place with so much things for you that will not let you go. Never. A city with the most peaceful forest, habitat of that third-eyed deer who likes to hunt your dreams by showing your future and imminent death, and the man with a face that cannot be seen, with his arms longer than the rest of his body. We highly recommend you to bring your mosquito repellent and do not get lost from your trial.

But if walking in the forest isn't for you, you can walk over the beach at the coast of the city, feel the breeze on your face and relax at the warm water of the sea, but if you feel the water is getting too hot, leave the beach immediately and do not follow the singing. 

Or you can eat at the Space Chamber's, where they serve the only source of hamburgers in the city. If you see some weird hieroglyphics, symbols from those you see in the corn fields, projects of spaceships and that typical alien stuff, don't be scared, that's the main theme of that shit-hole. It seems like Mister Brenderson has created a sort of fascination after hearing the rumors of alien abduction in the city. Some people say he's wanting to get abducted to scape from his wife, and I really trust it. But they are pretty good at what they do, and you will love the day's special. I just suggest if you see a product without the packing date, refuse the food and ask for your money back. You will not want to know what he's putting in your food.


Did you ignore my advice or just ate the food by accident? Do you feel something growing in your stomach? Are you afraid? If so, no problem, go talk to Sheriff Gallagher, he will convince Mister Brenderson to give you the antidote. For the safety of others, he will leave you in his room, where you will wait all the time. You can have a couple of coffee, see some sitcoms and even eat the snacks in the snacks machine, just don't open the door at the end of the hall, no matter how much she screams for help.

As you may know now, things happen in this city. Things really weird, and we transmit (and investigate) every strange event in this place just for you, every single midnight. Also, feel free to ask some questions or suggest an investigation about anything that occurs in this place. My name is Keith Hamberton, and you are listening to the first transmission of The Midnight Station. I will be glad to tell you some stories, but first, let's get to the commercials. Anthony, it's up to you.


[COMMERCIAL BREAK]
Antony: hey, fellas! Are you tired of your sink clogging? Are you incompetent enought to unclog it or just wanna pay for someone to do the job, like Jonathan Hill? Then this ad is not for. That bitch is creeping! He will knock your door and stare through the magic eye, asking if you want some free services as a demonstration of his work. If you don't want to go to the therapist, tell him to suck a dick, or just say you're not interesting. The choice is yours. Just don't let he enter your bathroom; you will not like to see what he does there. It's disgusting. If you see him, call the sheriff Gallagher immediately, but don't worry, he's not allowed to kill the guy, i think.



Keith: Well, this was more like an advice than anything. I worry about what he does in the bathroom. Hm, never mind, better not know. Now, here is the news.

Some weeks ago, people on the edge of the city started sensing a strange smell. Eventually, they found the smell was coming from the forest, and now it looks it's coming more and more pungent. The smell is something particular, never sensed before, as described by Daniel James, "it was a smell I never, ever in my life, have smelled. Trust me, I know every single smell in this world". Some time after, we found he had anosmia…

But, in fact, the smell is getting more powerful, and some people related seeing a type of mist coming from the forest, the same local of the camping event of the High School of the town. Because of that mist, the camp was evacuated, but it seems some people could not escape in time. He sent our journalist Ashley to interview those affected. Hello, Ashely, how's it going there? It seems you came prepared, are you using a gas mask?

Ashley: Oh, hello, Keith! Yes, i am! It's because it smells like shit here. You see, it seems some people got really affected by that smell, I mean, affected real bad. I can see them being transported to the ambulance in hospital stretchers, with some oxygen tubes in their mouths. They're tied in that stretchers and are struggling against it really hard, almost desperately, and they have some creppy dark veins through their bodies.

Keith: Oh, that's bad. Real bad. But I think there's nothing we can do about it. You did a great job, now come ba—

Ashley: Hey, I can interview that guy!

Keith: Wait, no Ashley! Don't—

Paramedic: Hey, kid! What're you doing! Back off! Don't take off his mask!

Ashley: Excuse me Sir, but can I ask a few questions? First, did you see the cause of the mist and the smell?

???: It came from the depths…the darkest and deepest holes, a place of nowhere. I saw love in the hole, I saw hope, I saw fear, I saw a mist, I saw him! 

Ashley: I just think you had a meeting with Bob Ma—

Ashley: I was lonely, looking for love. He gave me love, i am loved, i am him, you also will be. DoN't ReSiSt AnD leT gO yOuR sOuL tO tHe fIeLdS oF hEaVeN.

Paramedic: Stop, he's trying to escap—ARGHHH!

*Sound of flesh being destroyed and screams from everywhere.

Ashley: …I think the medics will handle it, or the police, or the church. Man, that shit was crazy! I am leaving this place before that ancient god awakens and makes some Evangelion reference. This is Ashley, over and out!



Keith: Ahm…thank you, Ashley. I don't really know what it is, but maybe we should investigate, if our listeners want to. But for next…

Have you seen this cat? A cat has been missing for the last two days. His owner is Fred Mackenzie, and he is "desperately wanting to find him before he does something". Fred had put some missing posters to help find his cat. His name is Mister Gordon, he is orange with some nice white details, has a deep meow, green (sometimes dark purple) eyes and a strange sadistic smile. Last time seen: house of the Old Ezequiel, with some black and red lights inside. Please, if you see this cat, call Fred. He doesn't have a smartphone, but you call at the King's Pizza. He's always in that place for dinner.



Well, that's what i call cat-tastrophe. Right? Ahem…well, sorry about that. Maybe…we should end this transmission here, and for the next one, the more popular questions will be answered. A lot of things happened, but don't worry, they are never close enough to hurt you, but also never far away to not hunt your thoughts. I am Keith Hamberton, and this is the Midnight Station. Please, don't trust racoons. They're not racoons.

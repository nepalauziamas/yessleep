A few days ago I was trapped in my own home with a tarantula. I am finally able to sit still and journal what happened so I may process it and so that everyone who reads this can know the truth:

&#x200B;

There is a tarantula in my bedroom. It is in the corner on the opposite side of the room where I lay in bed. It is faced away from me. It is eating something but I cannot fully tell what it is because its hidden by the spider's body. Tarantulas are the largest discovered arachnids in the world. This one is bigger than any of those. I didn't see from where it came. It was just there when I woke up. It's eating something crunchy; except, after every chew a whole chunky mass of blood spills to the floor.  The lumps of guts in the blood look human. 

I do not think I can breath. It has not noticed me. It keeps eating. New guts, also, keep draining. Whatever its eating has more insides than anything of its size should reasonably hold. 

It stopped eating and now it has not moved for hours. I have not moved either. I am hiding beneath my own blankets. At this point I only see the spider as a shadow behind my bed sheets. It is a sunny enough day to see shadows.  

I cannot move. I am begging to any god. Please listen. Its going to eat me alive.

It still has not moved. I think it is resting.

My own mind is lying to me.  A black widow is underneath the sheets with me. Where the hell did it come from. 

I somehow managed to not jump out of my bed, and luckily, the black widow didn’t move either. What I had to do had not changed. I stayed still. As long as that thing out there is loosing rigidity and slowly sucking the flesh it rests on, I guess me and this black widow are friends. Who did I make mad enough to bring to me this horror. 

For the second time now, I cannot breath because I cannot let that thing hear me. The air I do get travels to my lungs and dies there. I can feel my blood not moving. My toes and fingers go numb because the air don't go where it cant and then the thoughts go numb too... 

I get snapped back to reality when I hear the only thing that could make my chest hurt even more. My pet peacock crying somewhere on the other side of my home. I have loved my pet since I was four years old. My parents bought it for me after they found me sleeping to an hour long recording we had on cassette. It was a recording of peacocks singing during the night and you knew it was nighttime because crickets could also be heard. Ever since then peacocks are pretty much the only thing that people talk to me about.

I cannot bare it. It is everything I have ever kept close to me and now the tarantula is running towards it. Despite my earlier fear, I had to stop hiding once I heard my pet in danger. Now, I am watching the tarantula eat my pet. I wish I could say that I ran to the rescue. I just stood there. The tarantula struck itself into a rigid form when it noticed me.

But it did not come running towards me. It looked at me. I think it knew I was trapped with it. It would save me for later. So it just looked at me. And, its as if the spider was putting the thoughts themselves into my head. All I heard over and over. I am going to kill you. Watch me. Watch me eat your pet.

It was like I was frozen in time listening to the same bad song, in perpetual rhyme. My pet’s blood goes between sticking and dripping on the spider’s stiff hairs. The guts are thickened with salivitory grime. Like a bad dream that never ends, I watched my only pet being eaten alive.

I cant get away. All my windows and all my doors to the outside are covered in thick spider webs. Entangled in them is the remains of hundreds of different species of spider. And now I am seeing less and less of my pet. I cannot stand around much longer. 

I get jolted with this realization and I immediately hide in the walk-in closet in my bedroom. I double-triple checked that the closet door was shut securely. I barricaded the door using the cabinet that I kept in there for general storage. I propped the cabinet against the door and packed a wall of clothes around that. I don’t think it will help much but it was the best I could do. And I guess in the end the spider never tried to force itself through the door.

Either way, I had a multi-tool with a small pocket knife stored in the cabinet. It took a while to tunnel out of my wood house. It took as long as you would expect. And, as if it were asking for permission, the tarantula was softly knocking on the door the whole time.

Nobody believes me. I have told everyone I know and I even went to the police. They all say that there was no “monster” spider to be found. That is true but the police did go to my home and found my dead pet along with massive amounts of spider webs.

People cannot accept that my memory of the event is accurate. They somehow find it easier to believe that I was some sort of spider hobbyist who kept hundreds of different spiders roaming free, and that one day I had a random panic attack and dug holes into my home. And the only thing anyone cares to ask me is what my pet peacock’s name was, as if that even matters after what I’ve been through and all of the evidence that I have. 

The police officially found and documented the following in my home: 

* One dead peacock.
* Walls lined with dead and dry spiders suspended in thick layers of spider web.
* Two large holes in my home’s exterior. 

Nobody can help me if they do not believe me, so I have stopped trying to convince anyone I know. I still listen to that recording of peacocks every time I rest. It would always lull me into a peaceful sleep. Right now it doesn’t calm me the same. I have listened to that track every single time I have slept after I had first found it. I am not going to stop listening now when I need its support the most. I have been listening to the one track on my phone on loop ever since I escaped. There's no place like home. 

As of the time that I post this I have not slept in over 113 hours now. I walked to my local drugstore and all I could find was melatonin and some tea but neither has helped. Nobody can explain to me why they do not believe me despite the evidence.

You guys got any tips for falling asleep?

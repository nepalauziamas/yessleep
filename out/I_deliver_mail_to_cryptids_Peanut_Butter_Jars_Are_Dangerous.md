At the start of my day, I got a text from my co-worker Max, someone who was slowly becoming my best friend. It was a very simple message that filled me with dread. 

‘I have the BEST idea EVER!’ 

I replied to the text to question Max about the vague message. I cared about him and knew he didn’t make the best of choices when I wasn't around. My suspicions were confirmed when I arrived to work to see Max missing.  

My job is to deliver mail to creatures of the night. I didn’t fully understand their world and the systems they lived by, so I got extremely lucky when they assigned Max as my co-worker. He looked human enough but was literally an oversized puppy. He had dog ears, a tail, and dog legs; just like his father who I had worked with for one job before it ended in disaster. His stepsisters were the receptionists that met us in the Zero rooms to hand over the mail to be delivered. They also gave us any extra information we might need pertaining to the current job.  

I entered the Zero room, which just looked like an empty office space with a single fold-out table for the receptionist to sit behind. Aside from Max being missing, I saw that she had her face in her hands and was clearly in distress. I quickly went over to her, worried about what would cause her such grief. Normally Max’s sisters were all stern and almost cold in their personalities. They looked identical to each other and it was nearly impossible to know how many stepsisters he had, along with all of their names.  

“What’s going on? Is everything alright?” I asked her, as my worry spiked.  

She shook her head, soft brown hair brushing her shoulders. I guessed she was Sal because of how long her hair was compared to the others.  

“Max... isn’t going to be in today. You'll be working with Belizas.” She said sounding choked up.  

My body felt cold. I was more concerned over my friend not answering my texts than working with the creature that ate my arm. My job had replaced the chopped off arm with one that looked normal and worked well enough. Belizas hadn’t interacted much with me since that happened even though we both now worked delivering mail.  

“Is he alright?” I asked, my voice shaking. 

A thousand horrible outcomes ran through my mind when my co-worker for the day kicked open a door on the far side of the room. I ignored her and waited until Sal could gather herself enough to look up at me with tears in her eyes. At first, she couldn’t even speak. 

“He... he got his head stuck in a peanut butter jar. I can’t believe I’m related to someone so stupid.”  

I now understood why she looked so distraught. If my older brother was dumb enough to do something like that, I would question my bloodline. Belizas stopped in front of the desk, leaned over it and placed an arm down clearly trying to flirt with the emotionally wrecked receptionist. Belizas was tall and thin with a flat chest. Aside from a perfect face and long white hair that warmed into red, she didn’t have much to work with attraction-wise. But she still tried every chance she got.  

“It’s a shame seeing a pretty thing like you cry. I can cheer you up, or give you something else to cry about if you’re into that kind of thing.” Belizas raised an eyebrow and Sal looked at her in disgust. 

I kicked her leg out from under her so she slammed into the table, nearly taking it with her as she collapsed to the ground. We both proceeded to ignore her cries of pain.  

“This should be a simple job. Belizas is strong and knows the way so hopefully you won’t get into too much trouble.” Sal commented as she handed me a box I quickly tucked under my arm. 

We went through the job in a few minutes. We would be going into the Maze. The area changed constantly. The first time I went inside it looked like an endless version of the Zero rooms. The second time it was a corn field. This time it would be what Sal described as a cliché run down abandoned mental hospital. The package that needed to be delivered was just a lightweight and small cardboard box. I started feeling fairly nervous doing a job without Max. I looked at my temporary partner, trying to figure out my emotions.  

Belizas nearly killed Max when we first met. She’d taken my arm in exchange for his life and eaten it. The fake arm I now had was because she agreed to work for the mail company for a year just to amuse herself. I might have gotten a basic false arm through work, but she worked her connections to get me a better one. Aside from some shoulder pain, and not being able to feel temperature, it functioned like a regular arm. Honestly, I had reasons to dislike her and ask for a different partner. But instead, I decided to forgive her for some unknown reason. 

“Come on. Let’s get started. Leave poor Sal alone.” 

She thankfully listened, and we went towards the door on the far side of the room. My hand shook when I reached out for the handle, not wanting to see what waited on the other side. Belizas didn’t want to wait. She shoved us both through the door and into a dark musty-smelling hallway. I noticed she wasn’t wearing her work uniform, but had a patch of our company’s logo pinned on her sleeve. The uniforms protected us from minor damage a creature might throw our way while in the field. It had already saved me a few times, and the only reason why Rufus had lost a leg was because he rolled his pant legs up to let his dog legs move around better.  

The door clicked shut behind us, letting us know there would be no turning back now. The entire building had seemingly turned to ruins long ago. The paint on the walls was flaking and cracked off in places. Some black mystery stains along the floor looked as if something wet had been dragged down the hallway at some point. Somewhere a breeze came through an open window and caused a broken hanging light to sway slightly. At least I was with someone pretty powerful in a creepy place like this. 

“You need to get the box to the basement. The elevators work most days, but if they don’t the stairs should be alright. Just don’t talk to any of the things roaming the hallways and don’t let them grab you.” My temporary partner said and slapped my back so hard it knocked the wind from my lungs for a second. 

“Why are you talking like you’re not coming with me?” I demanded after I recovered. 

Belizas looked down, a dreadful smile plastered across her face. The tips of her hair had already started shifting to flames and her attention got pulled elsewhere. A form appeared down the hall, and it kept staring at us. It was a dark shape made of faces twisting into each other. I suppressed a scream at the sight of it, but she appeared delighted. Her body changed to look much like how she looked when we first met. Her skin became dark and cracked and her head disappeared in flames. 

“I never get to mess around in places like this!” She cackled and charged forward, leaving smoldering spots where her feet touched the floor. 

Both forms clashed together in an instant brawl. I don’t know why I forgave her for anything. Belizas only had one thing on her mind. Herself. She wanted to get stronger and show off the power she collected. Instead of doing her job, her goal for the day was to simply play around. 

More dark shapes came from the room attracted by the noise. One got too close for comfort and I took off running. I couldn’t fight these creatures like my terrible partner. A while ago I’d been given a Sun Light by an overly friendly creature. It was meant to hurt other monsters who all mostly couldn’t deal with powerful sunlight. Even Max could be hurt if I used it around him. Now, a good idea would be to carry that around at all times with a job like my own. But that sounded smart and I wasn’t very smart most days. I’d washed my uniforms that night and took the bulky flashlight-shaped weapon out of the pocket without grabbing it on the way out the door that day. I had no idea how I hadn’t already died on jobs like this. 

I raced down the hallway, ducking between dark shapes and toward the elevator doors. I pressed the rusty button and heard a faint chime signaling the elevator was coming. I jogged on the spot, clutching the box to my chest and praying whatever we were dropping off would be worth all of this. Flames from Belizas’ fight came down the hallway and I could feel the heat from them. I needed to get away before she roasted me along with the rest of the building. Thankfully, the steel doors creaked open, but to my horror someone was already inside. Black human shapes stood there, all facing the back of the elevator. I gasped in fear, and it caught their attention. One turned its head, showing its lack of a face. 

Something had ripped the entire thing off. Some only had their jaws ripped off, and others were only missing parts of their eyes. Each slowly started to stretch their blackened arms out, trying to reach me. 

The stairs it was then. I frantically pressed the button to close the doors and took off like a bullet towards the stairs. I slammed the stairway door, knowing something started to follow behind me. Without any way to lock the door, I ran down the stairs taking two at a time when possible. Finally, my lungs and legs gave out and I had to take a break. I huffed and puffed in the ruined stairway, praying that nothing caught up while I did so. 

I looked over the railing trying to see how many floors I had left. The stairs twisted downwards into the darkness, appearing to go on forever. The sight of the endless stairs made me a little dizzy. Leaning against the cold cement wall, I wondered if this job was really worth it. Max's smiling face came to mind and I decided it was. I might be killed on one of these jobs in a ridiculously terrifying way, but at least I got to meet him. 

After I recovered, I went down the stairs a bit slower than before. I passed each floor without really feeling as if I had made any progress. A muted sound came from above, causing me to look up. I squinted and I thought I could see eyes shining back in the pitch darkness. I heard the sound again, this time a bit louder, and I could just barely make out a hint of a song echoing through the stairway.  

I moved my feet against the cold ground, getting ready to run. The blackness above my head started to come down closer as if it  had all became a liquid, ready to drip down and consume everything below. I needed to run. No matter how hard I pressed myself that song and the sound of moving water got ever closer. I didn’t dare look up, fearing what I might see.  

I knew I had no chance of reaching the bottom before the creature in the stairs caught up. I tried every door I passed just hoping one might open. Dark tendrils started to catch up and yet I still refused to look at the source. Each rusted handle rattled, staying locked and mocking my growing fear. Just before my emotions spilled over, a door opened and I ran into a well-lit hallway. I kept running, passing by a lively looking nurse next to a cart, causing me to question my sanity. She called after me, telling me to stop. I refused to listen. For a moment, the place looked like a normal hospital. Then, what lurked in the stairway came flooding inside. The darkness poured in, the thick liquid reaching out and corrupting everything it touched. The building rotted away as the darkness washed over every inch of the place behind me. The nurse turned into black sludge, making me run even faster. My body couldn't keep up with this pace. I needed to find a way out or I was going to rot away like everything else inside this place. 

Something very unexpected happened. My partner, who had abandoned me to do her own thing, appeared before me without either of us expecting it. The moment right before the darkness caught up to me, she came crashing through the ceiling. Her body slammed down so hard into the floor that it crumbled away, catching me in the fall.  

My stomach leapt into my throat as I fell, and Belizas screamed out a cackle of a laugh as she blasted through the floor under us before we crashed into it. She wasn't even aware I was next to her for a second. I shouted at her to do something other than fight, causing her to finally notice me. With a wide smile on her face, she twisted her body towards the oncoming floor and her hair started to glow. My uniform protected me from the heat when she unleashed a blast of flames so powerful, it tore through countless floors below. The darkness screamed behind us and it shot forward to twist around her. I got caught up in their fight and let out a scream as we fell downwards while black tendrils wrapped themselves around us.  

The darkness overtook my sight for a while. I felt as if I hit the ground, which caused my body to scream in pain just as another blast of heat tore through the blackness that surrounded my vision. I found myself sitting up, having nearly crushed the box we were meant to deliver; while Belizas stood by my side, her entire head and hair flaming. The corruption of the mental hospital slowly backed off. With another gleeful laugh, she charged at it, not wanting her fun to be over.  She left me behind yet again while she chased after our main threat. I sat in the new hallway, stunned over how the last few seconds had played out. 

My face felt as if it had gotten a sunburn from being so close to Belizas, but I somehow managed to avoid any other injuries. Standing back up, I started to try and figure out where we had ended up. At least this area looked nicer and cleaner than the rest.  

I walked down a white hallway filled with an endless line of doors, my nerves fried and expecting something to jump out at any moment. Further down the hallway a dark shape flickered. I pressed on, thinking I may be lucky to just walk by it. I almost passed it without looking down when a soft voice made me stop. 

“My bear... Do you know where it is?” A whisper came from behind. 

Against my better judgment, I looked over my shoulder. The one that spoke asked the question again as they ran their hands along the floor. Long dark hair covered their face and the rest of their body looked as if it might crack if anything touched it. Another smaller darker shape was nearby. I could have just kept going. And yet I walked over to the black bear plush and picked it up. Carefully, I got down low in front of the figure and handed the plush over. Thin small fingers tightened over the fur, expecting it to be taken away. When the toy was safely in their grasp, I thought I saw a hint of a smile on their face and they faded away.  

A clicking sound came from down the hallway and a door appeared at the end of it. My heart started to beat quickly when I thought that it might either be a way out, or the place I needed to deliver the box to. I took one step forward, and spotted more nearly transparent shapes looking over at me.  

They didn’t feel like they were a threat. But I still didn’t want to get near them. Each careful step brought me closer to the end of the hallway, and what I thought was my way out. Every time my foot landed on the tile floor, something else took a step closer. I clutched the box tighter, breathing as quietly as possible, trying not to make a single sound. I had a chance of making it to the door without any issue if I was just careful.  

Someone started to cry behind me. Again, against my better judgment I looked over. I felt torn. The door was so close and yet... I was unable to help myself. I took a few steps back to the dark and faded shape that was quietly crying to themselves. 

“Can... I help you with something?” I asked in a low voice, and got down to my knees. 

The figure appeared startled, even though they were missing their face. They looked around, trying to see if I was talking to them. When they realized someone paid them some attention, they raised their hands up to rub their missing eyes.  

“Can you... Listen for a while?” They asked in a voice ruined from tears. 

I nodded, knowing I didn’t really have a time limit on the job. The voice started out slow, telling me about their early life of living in a small farm house and of hearing the voice of their deceased mother. Without a way to keep track of the time, I patiently sat and let them tell me their life story. How they had ended up in the hospital, and how they died there due to neglect. I felt terrible for this poor person, and by the end of the story I needed to rub my eyes, trying not to let my own tears show. Having another person care about their death somehow calmed them. With a small sad smile on a hint of a face that appeared, the figure faded after placing a hand in my own and saying a soft thank you for listening.  

I needed to collect myself before getting back up. By the time I was ready to move again, more of those shapes of long dead people were closing in. Some asked me to listen to their troubles. Others begged me to find things for them. Some wanted important possessions like rings or toys, and other were looking for family members or partners. I wanted to help them all, I truly did. But they came in such large numbers I became swarmed with them. Their dark thoughts and past regrets filling the hallway like a dark sea I couldn’t escape from. Just as I thought I was going to be pulled into all their past misery, a hand reached over and dragged me away. 

When I woke up, I sat up coughing, trying to shake off all those dark feelings. A man stood over me, looking down from under large glasses that reflected light from the monitors that lined the entire wall. The room was dark otherwise, making it hard to see where he had taken me to. I froze, feeling tense, and wishing I had some sort of weapon just in case this man wanted to try something. 

“Is that for me?” He asked, pointing to the box I needed to deliver. 

“Uh.. Are you...” I paused to read the label on the box. “Dr. Wick?” I asked slowly even as I could see a name tag on his lab coat. 

He didn’t bother answering. He just reached out for the box. I handed it over and got the paper for him to sign to show the delivery had been finished. He didn’t see the slip of paper and tore into the box in seconds. All of his attention went to whatever was inside, what I had nearly died for. Four other arms slipped from under his coat and within seconds he nearly had a small model of some sort of complex robot together before I cleared my throat and waved the delivery paper in his face. He jumped, his glasses slipping down his face. 

“Oh right, I just got excited. This Gundam just got released and it’s nearly impossible to get them down here.” 

Now that my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I noticed some selves filled with more of those toys in the room. I held back a groan, hating the fact my life was worth a few minutes of entertainment, just so this man could put together a collector’s item. After I saw his face, I could have sworn he looked familiar. I brushed that aside to ask a more pressing question. 

“I don’t have to walk through this entire place to get back out, do I?” I asked him, fearing the worst. 

“Oh no, I’ll make a doorway out. You’re that human, right? The one who is missing their arm?” He questioned when we walked toward the closed door. 

“Yes?” I said, confused on why he would care. 

“I requested you because your doctor is my cousin. Could you bring this letter to Dr. Fillow the next appointment you have?” He requested, as he pulled out an envelope for me to take. 

I did a double take at his face. Now that I looked harder, I could see the similarities. I never would have thought Dr. Fillow had any family that weren’t as serious as himself. At least now I hadn’t just nearly died for a toy. I had nearly died for a toy and a letter, making the trip slightly better. 

“Also, I wanted you because you’re human. I need to thank you for treating some of my patients so kindly. Most creatures dislike human spirits. This place isn’t suited for creatures like your partner.” Dr. Wick commented. 

I looked over to the monitors to spot Belizas still fighting. At least she was enjoying herself but was this alright? Wasn’t she hurting some human ghost trapped in this place? Sensing my question, the doctor kept speaking. 

“This place was never a real hospital. It was made to collect spirits and attempt to help them pass on. The corrupted ones need that darkness to be destroyed which your partner is doing right now. The ones on the lower floors are more difficult. Very few supernatural creatures can deal with them. My job is to listen to them to help them pass on, but it does become taxing on the mind after a while. I needed an outlet to relax. You not only brought something I could take a short break with, but also laid to rest two spirits, so thank you. I’ll send a message to your supervisors saying how good of a job you did.” 

He sounded worn out, but also as thankful as his words suggested. I felt a little embarrassed by his praise. As far as I could tell, no one had ever complimented me on a job before this one.  

“I was just doing my job. You really don’t need to pass that along.” I said honestly. 

He smiled again, making him look tired. He opened the door and instead of the hospital hallway, I could see the Zero room. I asked about Belizas but Dr. Wick said he would send her on her way after she wore herself out. She was doing a lot of his work for him and he didn’t feel like kicking her out just yet. He thanked me again and I started to walk to the small receptionist table feeling a little bit proud of myself. Sure, I was going to have major nightmares of that hospital for the rest of my life, but I hadn’t died after my partner ran off. 

Speaking of my partner, before I reached Sal to tell her about how the job went, someone tackled me into a tight hug. My mood brightened when I pulled away to see Max beaming and his tail wagging. 

“I’m so glad you made it out! It must have been scary on your own!” His voice could barely be heard over his wagging tail. 

His neck had a bruised ring around it and I really worried that he had come closer to death than I did that day. I took his cheeks in my hands to press them together and squish his face. The happiness of seeing him nearly overtook any disappointment over him being so stupid. 

“I can’t believe you! Your head in a peanut butter jar? You made Sal cry! What would your-” 

I wanted to scold him, asking what his father would think of his oldest child’s behavior when a light coming from the ceiling stopped my words. We all looked up when a transposition circle appeared. I didn’t know much about magic, or anything on how to use it, but I’d seen enough of these circles to know what they were. The glowing faded when a small shape came falling out of the circle and to the carpeted ground. Sal started to get up from her chair, still in shock from the sight. 

A small brown dog with a different colored back leg fell to the ground on its side. A large jar of half-eaten peanut butter was firmly stuck over his head and around his neck. I honestly thought the poor thing was dead until one leg twitched. 

“Is that your dad?” I asked, unable to say anything else. 

Max and Sal became a blur of motion as they ran forward to rescue their father from the jar. She kept a hold of the small body as he pulled on the plastic jar, his clawed feet tearing into the carpet from the effort. They thankfully got the jar off, letting Rufus gasp in clear air. Then both of them pulled harder on him as he tried to stick his head back into the jar. 

For the first time since it happened, I felt a little less guilty that Rufus lost a leg while trying to save my life on our first job. Knowing this family, it was a matter of time before he lost a limb over something stupid. Defending a human just so happened to be the thing that got him first. 

While struggling to keep her father in dog-form to stay still, Sal said I was free to go home. I thanked her and left the odd family in the Zero room, fully ready to forget this day ever happened.

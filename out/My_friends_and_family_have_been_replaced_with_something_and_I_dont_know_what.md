As I wake up on a Saturday morning in the middle of August I look out my window to see a bright blue sky, cars passing by, and my neighbor mowing his lawn. I get out of bed and I eat breakfast and talk to my parents. My mom has to go in to the office early today and my dad has business to attend to up in New Hampshire, fine by me, day to myself.

My mom leaves for work at around 9:30 in a hurry, she doesn’t even say bye to me, weird, now that I think about it she didn’t really seem right this morning at breakfast, maybe she feels sick. I don’t think about my mom anymore as I hop onto my Xbox to play games with my friends. As I join my friend Nates party on my Xbox all I hear is tv static. I leave and I rejoin and I hear the static again, maybe his microphone isn’t connected I think to myself. I call him on my phone and ask if he can hear me, when he awnsered I get the same tone of tv static that his microphone is making. I hang up and text him, “hey man everything okay”? No response. At this point I’m done trying to talk to him so I decide to text my mom and see if maybe something is going on with the cable company. “Hey mom I tried talking i nate and all I could hear was static do you know if everything is okay with the cable?”

Nothing.

It’s been two hours at this point so I decide to go downstairs and have some lunch. The second I open my fridge my front door opens. I was a little startled but when I saw it was just my mom I was calm again. The second I tried talking to her her head snapped to look at me. Not in a scary way, it was just odd. After I was done talking to my mom, she just opened her mouth, as if she was trying to talk, the only thing that came out was that tv static. Now I was starting to get freaked out. In the phone and in an Xbox party, fine, but my mother making that noise? When I tried confronting her about it her face started to change, not in a super noticeable way, but if you were looking real hard then you could definitely tell. Now I was scared. Was something going on with mom? I called my dad and that same tv static.

I went outside and my mom followed. She wouldn’t leave me alone, I didn’t realize it inside but when her face changed she started whispering something, she was saying how I’ll feel better when it’s over, I started to run away, she followed.. the faster I ran, the faster she followed, I eventually lost her about a mile away from my house. As I started to walk back it began to rain. Great. When I got back to my house soaking wet I noticed my dads car was at my house but my moms car was missing, maybe she went back and got into her car to come find me i thought. I walked in and was met by my dad standing by the bottom of stairs, mumbling something to himself, something about how it would all be over soon and how pretty the other place is. “Dad”? I asked, he turned around and stared at me in a fraction of a second. That wasn’t my dad, it had no face, no eyes, no mouth. Just skin, he…. It started to walk towards me , I didn’t notice the blade in his hand until it was four inches into my head, as everything faded to black I was overrun by this feeling of happiness. Dad was right, it is pretty, would you like to see

“What the fuck is he doing down there?” – I asked, baffled.

“Dunno.” – Jackson shook his head – “But whatever it is, he’s not safe down there. His submersible can go down some, but not that deep, so he must be in his suit down there.”

“We gotta go help him.” – as much as I hated myself for saying that, I knew we couldn’t just leave him down there.

“We should contact HQ for backup first, at least.” – my partner responded.

“There’s no time. It could take us a while to find him and he’s running out of oxygen with god knows what down there. We need to go down now.”

“Alright fine. Let’s go.” – Jackson sighed and with brief hesitation started steering the submersible directly down. 

To say I was scared shitless was an understatement. Here we were diving deeper into the Midnight Zone, where barely any creatures ventured, let alone humans. It all made me feel so small and vulnerable, being in such an inhospitable place to mankind. There’s a good reason why we can’t swim all the way down here without our technology, I thought to myself staring into the abyss before me.

“Check this out.” – Jackson shook me back to reality.

He pointed to the sonar which showed no activity. On the one hand that put me at rest, but on the other hand made me worry about that missing person who sent the distress call.

“See this circle on the sonar?” – Jackson pointed to a ring in the outer layer – “that shows potential threats like walls and rocks we can run into.”

“But it’s circular. And it's all around us.” – I replied.

“Precisely. And it appeared as soon as we descended below the cliff.” – Jackson responded.

“Fuck me.” – I gasped – “This isn’t a cliff at all. It’s a sinkhole.”

“Yep.”

“What the fuck was the S-158 doing here?” – I muttered to myself.

We were approaching the depth of 2300 m. Nothing changed visually compared to the previous 1000 m, but we still felt uneasy being so far below the surface.

“We should’ve seen some life by now.” – Jackson spoke – “There’s supposed to be all sorts of sea life detected on the sonar, but we saw nothing. Not even the tiny creatures. It’s strange.”

“Maybe this is predator territory, or used to be.”

When we approached around 2500 m depth, we started to notice a very faint red light blinking in the distance below us.

“That’s it, that’s our guy for sure.” – Jackson said and sped up the submersible.

The red light would flicker on and off intermittently every second and as we got closer, it grew in brightness. When we were close enough to the light to identify the source, we stopped.

“Holy Christ” – Jackson said as we stared at the busted submersible which unmistakably belonged to the crew from S-158.

It lay sideways on the floor. The glass was completely shattered and the command console broken. And then I caught something else at the corner of my eye. Every time the beacon would flicker, it would illuminate something on the ground close to the vehicle. Jackson steered our vehicle in that direction and then stopped again, audibly gasping.

“Dammit.” – I grunted at the sight in front of us.

A body of a dead man in a deep diving suit lay before us. He was missing an arm and leg and his torso was half-eaten. The helmet was cracked open and his open eyes stared blankly in shock.

“Dammit, we were too late.” – I shook my head.

“He has a camera on him. Let’s see if it has any valuable info.” – Jackson  said and maneuvered the sub closer.

He pressed some buttons and used what we call “the hand” to extend a robotic hand from the bottom of the sub and controlled it clumsily until he managed to grab the camera off the soldier's chest and retract the hand inside.

Once the water drained, I opened the panel at the bottom and retrieved the device. I plugged it inside the console and a video started playing. The camera followed a man from first person perspective on a submarine which was breached, frantically running and panting while screams of his crew members were heard in the background. He jumped inside a submersible, closed the hatch and quickly ejected himself into the water, muffling the dying screams behind.

He steered his vehicle upward as a ferocious screech which could not be from anyone human followed behind. Then for a split second we saw something huge swim across his view in front of the submersible before disappearing out of sight. The soldier gasped loudly and his breathing became even more shallow. He glanced at the depth modulator which was rapidly decreasing from 1400 m. He was reaching the surface.

But then there was a loud crash which shook his entire vehicle and almost knocked him off his seat. His sub stopped moving and instead started to sink slowly.

“No, come on! Not now!” – he frantically slammed buttons as multiple warning messages appeared on the console screens. The sub couldn’t start.

“Fuck!” – he slammed his fist on the keyboard.

The depth modulator was rapidly increasing now. 1300… 1350… 1400… 1500… 1700…

More and more warning messages kept popping out and as a last resort, the soldier entered a command on the keyboard to send a distress call.

The creature which hunted him was practically toying with him, swimming around his vessel, growling and hissing. We couldn’t see anything except an enormous fishtail which would pop in and out of view occasionally.

In seconds , the creature disappeared completely and could not be seen nor heard. The soldier stood up and peered out the window, looking for the creature. But then, something even worse happened. A crack appeared on the glass in front of him. The soldier recoiled as the depth modulator screamed warnings about being deeper than deemed safe, but before he even had time to react, more cracks appeared and then the entire glass burst open, filling the inside of the submersible with water. 

There was tumbling upside down and before we realized what was going on, the soldier was out of the vehicle and dropping uncontrollably into his inevitable demise with nothing visible around him. The next few seconds were filled with footage of him staring down at the black nothingness under his feet as he forcibly sank deeper and deeper, panting and desperately flailing his arms and legs to slow down his fall.

My stomach turned into knots as I watched him fall for what seemed like hours. Soon though, his feet finally touched the lifeless ground and he collapsed softly to the floor. He looked at his surroundings, hyperventilating and desperately trying to find something other than the darkness surrounding him.

The submersible’s beacon appeared in his view soon and with a loud crash it touched the ground, not too far from him. He started to inhale and exhale in a controlled manner, stabilizing his breathing, as he took slow steps towards the now useless submersible. He spoke finally in a somewhat calm manner:

“If anyone finds this, I’m captain Conley of the S-158. My entire crew is dead and I’m the only survivor. And probably not for long. We ventured down here for a mission, but instead found something much worse. We woke it up from this forsaken sinkhole and now it's after us. This is a warning to anyone who finds this recording. Seal the sinkhole and bury this creature in it. Tell all units and explorers to stay the fuck away from this place as far as possible.  If this thing ever sees the light of day, we’ll suffer far greater casualties than one crew.”

A soft growl resounded from nearby and Conley spun around just in time to see… something, for a second before it lunged at him. I couldn’t take a good look at it, but whatever I saw in that split second did not match the description of any deep sea life I had ever seen before. The remaining few seconds of the footage were a black screen filled with Conley’s screams and the creature’s rabid biting. And then everything went silent and still.

Jackson and I looked at each other in disbelief. I was about to tell him to get us the fuck out of there and back to topside, to which he agreed, but then he looked at the sonar and cursed. I jerked my head towards it and let out a 'sonuvabitch' myself.

There was one huge dot on the radar. And it was heading straight for us.

 

My name is John Matthews and I'm coming to you guys for help. I’m a single father to my daughter Lucy, I’m not here asking for handouts like other single fathers would. The truth is being a father is horrible. The day started as any other day I was making breakfast for me and Lucy and then I would drop her off at school and I would then go to work. I picked her up from school and she was so full of energy “Jessy is my new best friend dad!” Lucy kept telling me “I know I'd like to meet her.” i was about to tuck her in when I noticed she was a bit warm so I went to go get a thermometer to take temp, she looked at me motioned with her hand for me to com over to her she then placed her hand by her cheek you know that childish way of telling secrets and she said almost made my heart drop “you do believe me right dad you do believe that Jessy's my best friend?” I tucked her in and went to bed.

I went to bed that night uneasy. I woke up multiple times that night seeing something shadowy moving around my room. The next morning I was dropping Lucy off at school and she looked very uneasy. I asked if something was wrong and she replied “I don't want to go to school today.” I told her she has to, I'm not going home, I'll be at work. She replied “ your right, I need to go to school, i'll go” she got out of the car and I watched her go up the steps to make sure she made it to class. As I was about to drive off I nearly hit a child, a little girl with blond hair and gray eyes. I stopped in front of her and she knocked on my hood three times and then went up the steps to get to class. 

The day went by at work and I went to pick Lucy up from school on the way home. She told me what she did during recess. I was thinking to myself of the normal stuff like tag or jump rope “and today we played a game called Mr. Void, Jessy taught us how to play it.” sounds interesting. Can you tell me how to play? I asked “NO! I CAN'T, I CAN'T!” she yelled frantically I never saw her this scared Lucy what is the Mr. Void game? I asked “I can’t tell you I don't want you to see what I've seen but if you really need to know Jessy can tell you tomorrow.” Does she have permission from her parents to come over? I asked Lucy, “Yes she does.” later that night I went through the usual routine I tucked in Lucy and went to bed later that night at 3:00am a hear a blood curdling scream come from Lucy's room I ran in there to check on her and I see her cowering under the sheets crying I pick her up and carry her to my room and hold her in my arms until she fell asleep I haven't needed to do that since she was four years old

The next morning I was making breakfast and I heard a knock at the door. I opened it and I saw a tall boy with blond hair and gray eyes and a little girl with blond hair and gray eyes. The tall boy greeted me “Hi Mr. J!” I was shocked how did he know that name I haven't heard that name since collage it was just a dumb nick name I had when me and my friends were to high to say our full names. “My name is William and I’m sure you already know my sister Jessy.” The tall boy responded  and then Jessy spoke “I'm sure you heard about our game so here are the rules, one keep all lights on at night, rule two don't have mirrors facing the bed, rule three if you hear on knock you safe, if you hear two knocks your being hunted, if you hear breathing you're ahead, if you hear footsteps your falling behind,  and if you hear a bang well you better never hear a bang, and rule four knowing all rules automatically makes you a player.” They then said their goodbyes and left. I closed the door and I heard Lucy drop a glass and it shattered. I see her crying. I asked her what was wrong and she then said something that made my heart drop. “I.. heard … a …bang.” 

Thank you all for listening to my story. I wish you all good luck and I hope none of you will ever hear a bang and if you do send my regards to Mr. Void.

I work alone. I’m a graveyard dispatcher so I have a few drivers that come in throughout the night but for the most part it’s just me. 

My company is a carrier for a food distribution warehouse and our office is in the back of the building that faces a giant field that butts up to a wildlife refuge. Its pretty much the only building out here since they were the first to build so, to say we are alone in the middle of nowhere is an understatement. 

Working alone never really bothered me and since I got the job I always used to joke about how it was the best job I ever had, but all that’s starting to change. 

To cure my boredom throughout the night I watch TikTok’s and listen to Reddit responses and scary stories on YouTube. It can be a bit creepy and sometimes I get a little jumpy when the lights shut off due to me not moving enough or a driver knocks on the door before I notice them but for the most part it’s just me psyching myself out. 

I’m 25 weeks pregnant so I tend to get hungry and I leave work to go find any fast food restaurant that is still open at 2AM. I’ve never really had any issues with being to scared to go outside or leaving work until last night.  

I was backing up when my alarm went off saying there was something behind my car. I really didn’t see anything except maybe a quick blur on the screen but when I looked out my window to see what it was there was nothing there. 

I chalked it up to being a coyote. I know they are in the fields cause I can hear them howling in the middle of the night sometimes. I kept backing up and that’s when I see a set of eyes reflecting in the tall grass behind my car. 

The eyes were low to the ground so I assumed my earlier assumption was correct and that it was a coyote, I just paused and waited to see if he would poke his head out. Until the eyes slowly started to rise up. 

It was higher then a coyote at this point so logically my next thought was, “ok,it’s a deer”, but then they rose even higher. 

Now I’m only 5’7 but this grass is way taller then me, Its never been cut before so over the past year it’s just gotten taller and taller, and I didn’t know of any animal that could stand up and reach the top of this grass that lived in the area. 

Sure a bear possibly, but I know there aren’t any bears around here to my knowledge, and I would of definitely saw it running into the grass if it was the creature that ran behind my car. 

I kept staring at it threw my backup camera until it stood so high it went out of view on the screen. I quickly turned around and looked out my back window but there was nothing there. 

It freaked me out and I promptly put the car in drive and took off, but I calmed down after a moment and told myself I was just tired and my mind was playing tricks on me. 

When I returned to the yard I checked the fields behind me before I got out and then pregnant waddled as fast as I could to the door and swiped my keycard to get inside.

I made sure all the blinds were shut so nothing could look into the office and more importantly so I couldn’t see anything either. The fields were quiet for the the rest of the night not even one coyote howl, and I never saw anything even after the sun rose which was unusual. 

I looked out into the field one last time before I got into my car to head home and I swear I saw the grass move like it does in movies when something big is walking threw it so I hopped in my car and went home. 

I didn’t drive slowly by the fields looking for the usual deer that pop up here and there like I normally do and promptly got as far away as I could as quickly as the speed limit allowed. 

I don’t know why it but it scared me to my core, and I’m a little worried about going back into work tonight but, maybe whatever is was won’t come back. 

Hopefully…

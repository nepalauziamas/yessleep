I have never ever lived in a house other than the house I am currently in. As a matter of fact, I was even born under this same roof. I had the best memories right in between these four corners and I would still smile from the thoughts of it. 
I could still recall, when I was 5, I was still starting to learn how to ride a bicycle and was too eager to do it without the training wheels. As a result I ended up having 4 stitches to my right brow. Though I could say, it was still one of the great memories I have. Dad was there mimicking mom’s nagging so I would not feel too bad about it, and mom rolling her eyes but smiling right after.

I could also remember the day my mom had my twin brothers. I was ecstatic! Finally, I’d have somebody to play with. 
To make all of this short, I somehow got too attached to our house. It felt very comfortable and safe not until I turned 16. 


Mom and Dad are always not around recently so I have to look after my two 9 year old brothers. Sometimes I’d wake up so early but would still not be able to catch both my parents. They’d even come home very late, I’d already be asleep. But not just that.

I remember just last month when I was doing the laundry. I did some folding with the clothes and I specifically remembered placing it in the basket. It was getting late so I decided to finish it up first thing in the morning. When I woke up, all of the clothes were gone. But the basket was already in my room. I don’t think it’s a robbery because more valuable items are still there. I tried to ask my brothers which were still asleep and both of them surely had no idea.
I brushed it off thinking that maybe my parents placed it somewhere else. 
But then just a week after that, things got weirder. 

My brothers were watching tv while I was at the kitchen preparing our dinner. Our living room is visible from our kitchen so I had no trouble with watching the kids. All of a sudden somebody knocked at our main door. I know it would sound normal to you but we never had visitors at night because our house is located at a remote area. You’d have to take a car to get here and at that time there was none and still, if there was any, we could have hear it coming.
 The nearest house to us would even have to use their car to come here. 

Me and my brothers just stared at the door then to each other. One of my brother- Henry turned off the tv, then I started to walk slowly towards the door. I only had few steps when the light at the door went on. It went so bright, we could hear the bulbs buzzing. 
Then bam! It went off. I think it just exploded. I immediately got my brothers and let them stay behind the island of our kitchen. I made sure no one was outside and I didn’t get disappointed.
Right after that we hurriedly ate our dinner then went off to bed. We all slept at my room that night.

Our next encounter was 2 days after that. I was watching my brothers do their homework when we all decided to turn on the radio and listen to our favorite station. We all love to listen radio by 2 pm since it would be the comedy segment at that time. We were having a good laugh while my brothers were still coloring their textbooks, when suddenly the radio kept on making weird static noises. It became so loud and weird as if a lot of people are talking behind the static and buzzing; my brothers were covering their ears at this point. Then it stopped. Right after it stopped, a voice went on and said “ hello? “.
The voice was lady-like and gentle but it was so unfamiliar. But before we could react, the station went back to normal. I swear all of us had our hair at the back of our neck went up. We had no energy to finish the segment. 
At night, my brothers and I crowded up by the telephone. We had enough of it and decided to call our parents but then all the phone said was that they were out of service. I tried calling other people that we know of but it kept on saying on having trouble with the service. Did our parents forgot to pay our telephone bills? If yes, how could they!

Everything went back to normal for a week. But then one of my brothers, the quieter one started acting strangely. I heard him talking alone in their room while my other brother was watching tv at the living room. He was not just talking, he was actually having a real conversation. 
He was going on asking the address of who seemed to be no one. It gave me chills so I go on and ask him who he was talking with. He just giggled and said, “ oh just someone! “ then proceeded to go to the living room. 
Before I tucked them to bed that night, I asked him again the same question. But my other brother answered for him.
“ It must have been that lady with a very weird small tv. Was it her Harry?”
My other brother just nodded with a playful grin.
I just decided to play along with them. Maybe they made all this things up. You know how we all use to do when we were young. 

I could not sleep at all. I was looking up the ceiling trying to think of all I’ve witnessed this past few weeks. Suddenly it flushed through me. The feeling. My peripheral vision seemed to see an object. It was looking at me. I slowly changed my gaze towards the mirror and there it was. A lady in night gown sitting at the foot of my bed. It was no more than a second I jump out my bed and when I happened to looke again, there was no one. I was alone.

I could have imagined the whole thing.

I went to my brothers room and I didn’t care what they think, I slept at their floor.

From that night on, it became worst than before. Each day would feel worse than the day before. 
I would get up at 11 pm to a smell of something burning. First it was just smell, the next day I’d woken up to a sting in my right hip and still to a smell of something burning. I had it for days. 

I got to a point where I was tired of getting scared. Since we were not able to call for any help because the phone is not yet working and I can’t leave my brothers alone, I decided to perform my own house blessing or exorcism whatsoever. We sat in the living room floor in circle, all holding hands. I told my brothers to try to say what I say. I started praying. My brothers did as well. The lights went of and the wind blew so hard. We weren’t budging. We continued. It was probably at our 4th time repeating the same prayer that the lights went up again and the wind stopped. It felt fine as if we drove off whatever presence of evil was living in our house. Wow! Really? That’s quick.



I was confident it was gone. I told my brothers goodnight but before I could leave their room Harry told me something I’d never forget. 

“ Sis, she said to look under your bed. “



Oh please, enough with this. 



Right now I’m here at my room contemplating whether to look or not. But something inside me is telling me to seek the truth. It feels like I have a knowledge of all of this yet I keep on denying.

I’m going to look under the bed now. Whoever sees my letter if something happens to me, you better be makin’ this reach the newspaper.

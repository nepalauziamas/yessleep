Trembling, I watched the cop park the car and roll down his window as he said, "Found her."

"You took her tazer away?" Wayne asked, rubbing his chest as he glared at me.

The cop threw my purse outside, its contents scattering on the ground. "She didn't have one."

"She did. She must've gotten rid of it."

"Whatever. Take her, I’ve gotta get back to work. And watch where you dispose them. Me and Burt can't keep covering for you each time one's discovered."

"Yea, yea,” Wayne said, yanking open my door.

With my rapid breaths in a frenzy, I slid away and pressed myself into the corner, and Wayne leaned in and grabbed my hair, pulling me out. Jolted by pain and indignation, I couldn’t help but scream and kick, stopping only when a worried cry echoed from inside the barn.

“Candace?”

I froze, my distressed heart stumbling. “Sebastian! Sebas—”

I grunted as Wayne threw me on the ground, dirt replacing my brother’s name as I spat it out. I tried to get up, only to collapse in agony when Wayne kicked me in the stomach. Curled up and gasping, I flinched as he spat on me before slamming the car door shut.

“You scream and your bro gets it,” he snarled, kicking me again.

As I groaned in pain through my tears, the cop said, “I’m serious, Wayne, watch where you dispose them. Station’s getting suspicious.”

“I get it,” Wayne said in irritation. “I won't get you or Burt in trouble."

“And don’t be too loud, mom needs her rest.” He checked the time. “The doc doubled her dosage, don’t forget.”

“For fuck’s sake, Don, we aren’t idiots. Just go, we’ve got it taken care of.”

Grabbing me by the hair again, Wayne dragged me inside, and I swallowed my screams as I thrashed and writhed, struggling to get to my feet and ease the searing pain across my scalp.

The scent of wood and burlap hovered around us as we entered the barn, and my terrified eyes darted around, catching glimpses of wooden beams, stacks of hay, and piles of large, suffed bags illuminated by a dim light.

“Candace! Let go of her you f—”

Sebastian cried out in pain, and I jerked and twisted as I yelled, “Stop! Don’t hurt him!”

I gasped as Wayne flung me across the floor, and I tumbled right into Sebastian, both of us falling over into a red puddle. With my throbbing scalp forgotten, I scrambled to my knees, scanning him up and down with shock and horror. They’d obviously broken his nose, the flowing blood coating his teeth and split lip. With his hands cuffed behind him, he had no way of stopping them, his face beginning to swell against fresh bruises.

“Sebastian! Are you okay?”

He struggled to sit up, his worried eyes checking me as well. “Did they hurt you? Are you okay?”

“That pint-sized toothpick’s the one who got the best of ya?” a laughing voice asked.

I turned to the guy who said that, only now noticing there were three other men in the barn besides Wayne.

And Georgia.

I stared at her, stunned, my stomach twisting. Was she a part of this? Did she trick us? In the faint light, I could see her cheeks glistening with tears, a black eye blossoming beneath her disheveled hair. No, she wasn’t a part of this. At least, not voluntarily.

“She didn’t get the best of me,” Wayne said, glaring at the laughing guy. “She fucking *tazed* me.”

“And you let her do that?” another guy asked, unimpressed.

“She came outta nowhere while I was focused on this one!” Wayne said, kicking Sebastian in the chest.

“Stop!” I yelled, throwing myself over my groaning brother. “Leave him alone!”

“Please, Wayne.” Georgia’s soft voice quivered as she touched his arm with a shaking hand. “You've taught them their lesson. Let them go.”

“Let them go, why?" he asked with a disgusted snarl. "So he can keep railing you?"

"We didn't do that, Wayne, we didn't. I told you, I took photos of his dog for my class and just wanted to show him and thank him."

"I don't believe you."

"I promise. I downloaded the photos on my cloud. I can show you."

"I'd like to see them," the unimpressed guy said. "I wanna see what's so special about this dog."

Wayne pulled a phone out of his pocket and handed it to Georgia, and all four men crowded around her as she scrolled through with trembling hands.

"Damn, that's a huge dog," the laughing guy said.

"See?" Georgia said. "That's all we—"

She gasped as Wayne snatched the phone away, and she tried to reach for it as she pleaded for him to give it back. Dodging her attempts, he kept scrolling, and his face contorted in disgust.

"What? What'd you find?" the laughing guy asked, eager as he hustled closer.

Wayne turned the screen towards the others. "These don't have that big dog in them at all. But they do have this dog," he said, spitting on Sebastian.

"Wayne, please …" Georgia said, tearing up. "I was just practicing with the focus and exposure."

"No, I know what it was," he said, making her cry out as he grabbed her arm. "And I think you should show us."

"Wh-what?"

He pushed her on top of Sebastian and me, the three of us grunting in pained bafflement. 

"Go ahead," Wayne spat before pulling me away with unhinged resentment. "And I think it's only fair I join in."

His words stabbed my heart, his touch rattling the chains of traumas I'd kept locked away. A scream tore out of my lungs as I kicked and thrashed, refusing to fall victim to his depravity.  

"No!" Sebastian yelled, getting to his knees as he tried to crawl over. "Leave her alone, you sick bastard! Leave her alone! Ow, get off me, asshole!"

"Wayne! Wayne, stop, please!" Georgia cried, running to me before the laughing guy grabbed her. "Dale, please stop him!"

"Why?" the laughing guy asked. "I'm enjoying this, and I'm going next."

"Chuck, please, this is going too far!"

"You started it, screwing this n—" The unimpressed guy yelped. "He bit me! Benny, don't just stand there, help me keep him down!"

As Sebastian and Georgia fought Dale, Chuck, and Benny, I focused all my energy on Wayne, twisting, kicking, and biting, my heart in overdrive, my ugly memories threatening to explode. A glint of silver sliced through my shirt, and I screamed as Wayne pinned me down, crushing my cuffed hands beneath me.

"Get off me!" I yelled, spitting in his face.

He slapped me before curling a calloused hand around my throat, the other tugging at my pants. Bursts of my past flashed through my mind, and tears spilled down my cheeks as I fought both their ugliness and Wayne's.

"What's taking so long?" Dale asked.

"She's wearing some kinda wetsuit or something," Wayne growled, yanking at the skintight material of the inner suit Alex made me.

"Then just slice it off, idiot."

Wayne's blade nicked my throat as he tried to slide it beneath the collar, and I strained and bucked and I struggled to escape him. The suit was meant to stop things from going any further, but it didn't stop anything leading up to this point. That was the stun glove's job, and I didn't have it.

Determined to prove how vile he was, Wayne kept trying to remove the suit, sweat dripping off his red face as he stabbed and sliced, his tobacco breaths nauseating. The material was resilient, but I wasn't as I gasped and writhed with every cut and bruise, Sebastian and Georgia's pleas constant in the background.

"This damn thing's impossible!" Wayne roared as he stood up, lifted me by my collar, and threw me across the barn.

My scream was cut short as I landed atop something soft, and I backed away in fear at the sound of a yelp and a whine. In the shadows, black, glistening eyes blinked at me. A dog. A big dog, cowering. But not from me.

"You useless bitch," Wayne said, kicking it in the side. "Move!"

"Hey! Don't hurt her!" I rasped, throwing myself between them. "What's wrong with you, you psycho!"

"Protecting their own kind," Dale said from a distance, laughing. 

"Get off of me!" Sebastian yelled. "Candace! Are you okay?"

"No, I'm not!" I yelled back, shaking with revived traumas and piqued indignation.

With an ugly sneer, Wayne went to kick the dog again, and I blocked his foot with my body. He chuckled for the first time, its nastiness reminding me of the cop's, and he walked around me to kick the dog again. And again, I blocked him.

"Stop it! Leave her alone!" I yelled, glaring at him as I huffed and stumbled back and forth in an attempt to protect the poor animal.

I didn't know why the dog didn't defend herself or just run away. She looked like a Rottweiler, and she wasn't chained up, she could easily pounce on this barbarian. Instead she chose to cower behind me, whining each time I ended up crashing into her.

"Wayne, check this out!"

Wayne paused his abuse to turn to Chuck, and I turned as well, only to gasp. They had Sebastian hanging from his neck by a rope, the toes of his shoes barely touching the ground as he teetered. Georgia was sobbing, straining against Dale's grip as she pleaded to heartless ears.

"Thought we could have us a little piñata party, see what falls out," Chuck said, grinning as he twirled a bat. "Bring the bitch."

"Which one?" Dale asked as the brothers laughed.

Despite my struggling, I soon found myself hanging beside Sebastian, my heart rattling in my chest as the taut rope dug into my neck. Pivoting on tiptoe, I turned to look at my brother, our eyes exchanging their helpless terror.

"Candace, I'm sorry," he whispered, his regret heavy behind his tears. "I'm sorry for what I said and for leaving you behind like that. I'm so sorry."

His apology spiked my resolve, and I shot him a glare of determination. This wasn't the time to say our last words. We weren't going to give up. Not to these abusive racists. We were going to make it. We just had to use our skills and figure out how.

"Don't say this now," I rasped, jutting my jaw. "Say it after we're safe."

The brothers laughed. "Listen to this delusional freak," Wayne said.

"Please, don't do this," Georgia cried, trying to twist her arm out of Dale's grip.

They all ignored her as Chuck held out the bat. "Alright, who wants to go first?"

Before anyone could answer, all four of their phones beeped. 

"I'll take this shift," Benny quickly said, jogging to the barn door.

"The doctor doubled her dosage," Wayne called out after him. "Don't forget!"

"Thanks for reminding me!"

Their mom. She was obviously sick. So sick she needed them to care for her. It didn't seem like there was a dad in the picture. But Sebastian and I had a dad. A rich, powerful one.

The hectic gears in my mind whirred as they rearranged all this jumbled information, and I wheezed out, "Our dad's rich! He'll pay a big ransom for us if you call him!"

The remaining brothers laughed. "Rich, huh?" Dale asked. "What is he, a drug dealer?"

"Yes!" Sebastian rasped, catching on. "A very good one. He'll pay a million dollars! Or even more! And he won't call the cops because he doesn't want them knowing about his business, so there's no risk for you!"

Chuck scoffed, but Dale said, "Hey, we could use the money."

"They're lying," Chuck said.

"I'm not passing up an opportunity for millions! We can call, and if it's bogus, we'll forget it. What do you say, Wayne?"

Wayne thought for a while before he smiled. "I think it's worth a shot."

My heart leapt and I turned to Sebastian, wincing as I struggled to stay upright. Sweat dotted his forehead above his optimistic eyes, and I blinked back tears as I hoped our plan would work.
 
Chuck pulled out his phone. "What's your father's name?"

"Alex," I said.

"Give us the number."

Sebastian rattled it off, and we all remained silent as the phone rang on speaker. I shot a glance at Georgia, her eyes on Sebastian as she hugged herself, Dale still holding her arm. She seemed to be following our lead. I just hoped we weren't leading ourselves to our death.

"Yes?" Alex said.

"Is this Alex?" Chuck asked.

"Yes."

"We've got your son and daughter, and we'll kill them if you don't pay us a ransom."

"Very well. Five million in an hour at the East corner of Valley Park," Alex said before hanging up.

We all stared in shock at the silent phone. I didn't know what I was expecting Alex to say, but it definitely wasn't that.

"What the fuck?" Wayne asked, looking at everyone in bewilderment.

"So, is that it?" Dale asked with a hesitant smile. "We're getting the money?"

Chuck's expression shifted from confused to flustered to offended. "Who the hell does he think he is! He doesn't get to tell us what to do! *We're* the ones in charge!"

"Are you calling him again?"

"Damn right!"

"Yes?" Alex said, sounding inconvenienced.

"You listen here," Chuck spat. "And you listen good. We want *ten* million dollars left at the *West* corner of the  *cemetery* in *half an hour*. Come by yourself, alone, no police. Once we get the money, we'll tell you how to find your kids. Got it?"

"Very well," Alex replied before hanging up again.

"Motherfucker!" Chuck roared, dialing Alex again.

Dale sneered at Sebastian and me. "Seems your dad doesn't mind playing with your lives."

I knew Alex didn't care if Sebastian and I died. He may've taken us under his wing, but that didn't mean he'd mourn us if something unavoidable happened. But this wasn't unavoidable. It'd take Alex less than a second to pinpoint the location of this phone and send the cops in his network over, so why was he provoking these monsters?

"He blocked my number!" Chuck said, incredulous. "Dale, gimme your phone!"

Dale did as he was told, but Chuck still couldn't reach Alex. "What the hell does he think he's doing! Does he think this is a joke?"

"No!" I wheezed, afraid they'd take their anger out on us. "He … he's always like this!"

"Yea, yea!" Sebastian added. "He's so busy he sometimes blocks everyone!"

"Even us!"

"But he took your call twice which means this is very serious for him!"

"I don't care how busy he is!" Chuck spat. "Or how rich! I don't let *anyone* disrespect me like that! Especially not a lowlife drug dealer!"

"I got an idea," Wayne said. "When we go to the cemetery, we'll catch him dropping off the money and bring him here, teach him his place."

"What if he's not there?" Dale asked.

Wayne nodded at Sebastian and me. "Then we pick up where we left off."

"No, bro, I want that money!"

Wayne checked the time. "Look, it takes half an hour just to drive to the cemetery. If the bastard isn't there, we'll figure something out, but for now we should go."

"I don't care if we don't catch him, as long as the money's there!"

"Fine, let's go." Chuck handed Wayne the bat. "You stay here, keep an eye on these two and her, and let Benny know what's up. We'll call you with any news."

Wayne propped the bat on his shoulder and pulled Georgia away from Dale. "I've got it under control here, y'all go."

Chuck and Dale left the barn, and I pivoted to face Sebastian, my legs trembling as much as his. I could tell he was as anxious as I was, both of us wondering if we were going to survive until the rescue.

"We should keep you alive in case your dad doesn't come through with the cash," Wayne said, smirking. "But a body can take a lot of hits and still survive."

My eyes widened as he held up the bat, my frazzled heart jolted as panic rushed through my veins.

"No!" Sebastian croaked, shuffling in despair as Wayne aimed the bat at me.

"No, Wayne, wait!" Georgia said, grabbing his arm. "I … I want them to watch!"

He frowned as he turned to her. "Watch what?"

"Watch us," she said, stepping closer to him with a small smile.

He gave her a skeptical look. "Us?"

She nodded. "I wasn't sure before, about all of this, but I see now how much you're fighting to keep things pure. And the way you're taking charge, it's … turning me on."

"Oh, is it?"

I could tell he wasn't buying it, but it was working as a distraction. I just hoped Alex would come through for us sooner rather than later.

I grimaced as Georgia pecked Wayne on the lips, but she hid her distaste well as she whispered, "Was that okay?"

"It was alright," Wayne said, dropping the bat. "But I'd like something better."

Georgia gasped as he ripped her shirt, and she stumbled back, trying to muster a giggle. "Oh, that's a bit too fast for me!"

"Not for me," he sneered as he wrestled her to the ground.

She began screaming and fighting, and he laughed as he said, "Am I still turning you on?"

"Leave her alone, you psycho!" Sebastian wheezed, spinning in place as he almost lost his balance.

Wayne ignored him as he taunted Georgia. "You want them to watch? Then let's give them a show. Go on, I'll give you five minutes to try to escape me. And afterwards, the real fun begins."

With my pulse racing, I looked around the barn in despair. There was no one to help except Sebastian and me. I yanked and twisted my cuffs with frenzied desperation. They were stuck tight. We were stuck tight.

We could drop our weight, let ourselves hang, hope Wayne runs over to keep us from dying. But then what? He'd probably beat us within an inch of our lives before turning back to Georgia.

No, she risked a lot to give us this chance, and I was going to use it to save us and her. I had an idea, and I just hoped I could do it the way I imagined, or else things could go very wrong.

While Sebastian continued to squirm and yell at Wayne, I took a deep breath and slowly lifted my legs. Heat spread across my face as the rope squeezed my neck, my ears ringing as I focused on bringing my cuffed hands under and in front of me.

This was much easier to do sitting down, and stars began flooding my vision as I curled my body up and bent my knees. Grunting, spit sprayed from my lips as I managed to slide my hands under my butt, and I squeezed my eyes shut, my lungs spasming as I struggled to fit my legs through my arms. 

With a desperate surge of my remaining energy, I jerked my body up, and my arms flew free as my toes found the ground again. With hoarse, hungry breaths, I wrested the rope off my neck and stumbled into Sebastian, not giving myself any time to recover as I reached for his noose.

Tears coated his cheeks as his eyes met mine, their dread eclipsed by relief, but he didn't stop yelling at Wayne, continuing his distraction as I set his neck free. Despite her situation, Georgia must've seen what I was up to as well, as she kept her struggling away from us, forcing Wayne to look in the opposite direction.

The moment Sebastian was free, he ran behind Wayne and kicked him between the legs so hard Wayne tumbled off Georgia and curled into a ball, squeaking a string of pained gasps as he stared at us in disbelief.

Before we could do anything else, Benny entered the barn, yelling, "Hey! What's going on here?"

"Run!" Georgia said, jumping up and clutching her ripped shirt.

With Georgia in the lead, the three of us made a break for the door at the other end of the barn.

"Stop!" Wayne squeaked. "Benny, shoot them!"

I screamed as a shot echoed against the walls, and I looked back in concern to make sure Sebastian wasn't hit. He seemed alright, trying his best to run with his hands still cuffed behind his back.

The door led straight to the vast cornfield, and a quick look between us was all we needed before we dashed through the looming stalks in opposite directions, hoping to hide until rescue came. Shots rang out behind me as I zipped through the corn, my head throbbing and neck aching, my heart and lungs frantic as they fought to get oxygen back in my exhausted body.

"I see you!" Benny yelled, leaves rustling as he stomped after me.

Panicking, I took a sharp left, and then a sharp right, zig zagging in hopes he'd have a harder time aiming at me. I stifled a scream as a crack pierced the night, doubling my effort as I sprinted in haphazard directions.

Clouds shrouded the moon, and what little light I had faded as I raced past the stalks with blind determination. After taking another sharp turn, I gasped as another crack sent me crashing to the ground.

Panicking, I sat up, the searing pain in my foot stronger than any of my other aches. Afraid I'd been shot, I felt around my ankle, only to draw my wet hands back in shock as I felt bone.

I'd broken my leg.

Terrified helplessness washed over me as I sat there, panting, my heart rioting in my chest. I couldn't run. I had no weapon. And my hands were still handcuffed.

No, I wasn't going to give in. Jutting my jaw, I felt the ground for anything I could use to pick the cuffs. Once I was free, I'd snap off a stalk to use as a crutch and another to use as a weapon. I wasn't going down without a fight.

A distant shot rang out, making me flinch, and my heart dropped when I heard Wayne say, "I got him! You two bitches better come out or I'll kill him!"

"No!" Sebastian yelled, straining. "Candace, Georgia, keep running! Don't— … ow!"

"Wayne, stop this, please!" Georgia cried out from the other side.

Before I could decide what to do, leaves rustled in front of me and I froze, my pulse stumbling as I held my breath. Sweat trickled down my face as I sat there, trying to remain quiet as my thoughts bellowed. A soft glow lit up the corn as the clouds parted, and I gasped at the sight of two glistening, black eyes.

The dog.

Did they send her to find me?

Tense, I kept my eyes on her, gulping as she inched closer. She lowered her head, sniffing, but she didn't bark or draw any attention. Footsteps approached from my left, and I pressed my hands over my mouth, hoping Benny couldn't hear my thundering pulse as I saw his reflective shoes between the stalks. The dog cowered, her eyes darting from Benny to me, both of us terrified to make a move.

"You can't keep hiding!" Benny yelled.

The dog jumped at the exclamation and tore off in the opposite direction, and Benny turned and ran right after her.

"Wayne, I found one of them!" he said, panting.

I couldn't hear what Wayne replied as a soft droning overshadowed his voice. I frowned as the droning became louder, and my eyes widened when I heard sirens. 

The police.

Were they the ones Alex sent … or were they Wayne's brothers?

Biting my lip in nervous anticipation, I tried to listen to any dialogue above the noise, but the droning and sirens kept getting louder. The stalks around me began to whip and sway, and I looked up in surprise as a helicopter passed by, its beam of light scanning the area.

"Wayne, Benjamin," a voice called over the speakers. "This is the police. Donald, Burt, Charles, and Dale have been arrested. Surrender yourselves."

It was our rescue! My heart leapt and I cried, hoping Wayne and Benny would go down without a fight. Remaining still, I strained my ears as I waited for solid confirmation that it was safe. My optimism wavered when I saw movement to my left and I held my breath, only to let it out when two glistening, black eyes blinked at me. The dog was back.

We stared at each other for a few seconds, both of us overwhelmed by all that was going on. Not sure what to do, I reached out a trembling fist, and she stepped forward, sniffing it. Taking the chance, I brushed my open hand along her snout, and she licked my fingers before coming closer. With a relieved smile, I gently petted her, only to frown as I felt a spiked choke collar.

Disgusted, I took it off her, and she shook herself, scratching her neck before licking my face. With a soft chuckle, I reached over to hug her, but she flinched and backed away. I now knew how Sebastian felt.

"Candace, it's safe to come out," the voice over the speaker said. "Let us know where to find you."

"I'm here!" I yelled, shaking the stalks around me. "I'm here!"

The helicopter hovered above, its beam waving around until it located me. I squinted at the bright light and waved my cuffed arms, tears of relief pouring down my face.

"Candace?" Sebastian yelled from somewhere in the field.

"Sebastian! I'm here!"

Footsteps rushed towards me, and the dog bolted. I whipped my head in the direction she ran in pity, hoping the cops would find her. She deserved a home with people who cared.

"Candace!"

I turned back to see Sebastian making his way through the stalks, and my soul rejoiced. He was alive and safe. We both were. Was Georgia?

"Sebastian! Are you okay? Is Georgia safe?"

"Yes, the ambulance just took her!" He skidded to his knees beside me, his hands twitching as he kept them to himself and looked me over in concern. "Are you okay? You were so quiet I thought … I was worried that …"

He swallowed the lump in his throat, and I swallowed mine as I reached over and held his hands tight. "I'm okay, I'm okay," I whispered, sniffling, "and I'm so glad you're okay."

His voice hitched as his regret overflowed. "I'm so sorry for the things I said and for driving away and leaving you. I'm so so sorry."

"It's okay. They still would've caught us either way."

"But it wasn't right. You're my sister, you had my back, and I … I treated you like crap. I'm so sorry."

His voice shook, his hands gripping mine tight. He needed a hug. I knew he did. I needed one too. But I couldn't. I still wasn't ready. Especially after the traumas Wayne just agitated and amplified. With a rueful smile, I bowed my head towards Sebastian and squeezed his hands. He squeezed back, inching closer until his bowed head touched mine. And we sat there, waiting for rescue to take us home.

…

"I don't want to do that," I said. "I don't want to remember anything."

"You won't," Alex said, taking a sip of wine. "With hypnosis, I'll guide you through your memories, but I won't disturb them."

"I don't want to risk it. I know you're curious to know what I went through as a kid, but I blocked it out for a reason and I don't want you poking around."

"Have you considered the possibility that others may be suffering the same? If we uncover what you went through, we may be able to save other children from your experience."

I frowned, chewing on the inside of my lip as I went over his words. "You promise I won't remember what I say when you hypnotize me?"

"I promise."

"Then … okay."

"Wonderful. We can begin tonight."

I took a nervous breath, petting Watson as she lay on top of me on a lounge chair. Shirley, who'd been splashing in the waves, trotted over to us, and I moved my foot as he sniffed my plastic cast and tried to gnaw on it.

"No, Shirley, I told you, that's not a chew toy," I whispered, trying not to startle Watson.

With a playful bark, Shirley hopped around me, water flying off him, his tongue and ears flopping about. I chuckled, reaching out to pet him, and he took that as an invitation to climb on top of Watson and me.

"No, Shirley, there's no room for you," I said, the lounge chair creaking under all our weight. "Down, down!"

Whining, he got down and looked around. With Sebastian upstairs studying, the only other person out here was Alex lying on his own lounge chair in a full suit, and Shirley made a beeline to him. After scrambling up and dropping his entire sopping weight on him, Shirley laid his head on Alex's chest with a satisfied sigh. I held back a laugh when Alex didn't even react, as though Shirley draping his wet self over him was a daily occurence.

I held up my phone to snap a photo, and Alex said, "Taking pictures?"

"Yes," I said, giggling. "This is hilarious."

He took another sip of wine. "He's heavier than he looks."

"I know."

TAI buzzed and I touched my earpiece. "Hey, Sebastian. Done studying?"

"Yes, and are my eyes playing tricks on me or is Shirley smothering Alex?"

I laughed. "No, your eyes aren't tricking you."

"Please tell me you took pics!"

"I did, and you can take more from other angles once you come down."

"I can't, the moment Shirley hears me he'll come running." He groaned in a stretch. "Want anything from the kitchen before I come out?"

"A cream soda with some ice would be nice."

"Gotcha."

A few minutes later, Shirley lifted his head, letting out a booming bark before jumping off Alex and running. With a sigh, Alex brushed off his soaked suit and adjusted his tie before finishing off his wine.

"Shit, Shirley, no!" Sebastian said from a distance as glass shattered.

Watson lifted her head off my chest, whining as she tensed up, and I petted her as I soothed, "Don't be scared. You're safe. Shirley's an idiot and Sebastian's loud, but he's not angry at you. He'd never hurt you. None of us will. You're safe."

The anxiety diminished in her eyes, and she licked my face before laying her head on my chest again. Scratching her behind the ears, I watched Sebastian walk over, Shirley sulking behind him with his tail between his legs.

"I got you a glass with ice, but a certain klutz broke it," Sebastian said, handing me a can of cream soda as we watched Shirley run into the waves again.

I chuckled. "It's okay, thanks!"

"Hey, Watson!" Sebastian put a fist in front of her nose and she licked it, but she flinched when he tried to pet her.

"It'll take time," I said, noticing his dismay.

"I know." His frown lasted a second before he pulled out his phone with a smile. "Georgia sent me the new photos she took of Shirley! Check these out."

"Wow, he looks pretty majestic in these. Didn't think that was possible."

"Hey! Shirley's can be very majestic when he wants to! Alex, check these out!"

Alex took off his sunglasses as Sebastian showed him the photos, and he said, "She has quite the talent if she managed to find his photogenic side."

I laughed and Sebastian scowled as he looked between us. "You guys are the worst. Shirley is a magnificent and regal animal!"

"You're only saying that because he helped you get a girlfriend," I said, chuckling as Shirley rolled around on the shore. "How's Georgia doing, by the way?"

"She's alright, seeing a new therapist after she moved. We're taking things slow, which I think is a good idea for now." He cleared his throat. "Alex?"

"Yes?"

"Off the island, you use TAI and our phones to track us, right?"

"Yes. And I'd appreciate it if you didn't leave them behind again."

"Can you see or hear us?"

"Yes, but only if I find there's a need. Don't worry, I have no interest in hearing or watching you fornicate."

"We weren't fornicating!" Sebastian said, red tinting his cheeks.

"What does fornicating mean?" I asked.

"Banging."

"Oh, ew."

"And we weren't. But I know who was."

Sebastian wiggled his finger between Shirley and Watson, and I gasped in joyful surprise. "No way! Does that mean she's pregnant?"

"I don't know, Alex would have to do an ultrasound or something."

I had to stop myself from hugging Watson and squealing. "They'll have such cute puppies! And the puppies will count as a bunch of twins, right? Then we can do the ritual for Shirley and Watson and they'll live with us forever!"

"I figured that was why you refused to have me spay and neuter them," Alex said.

"It would work, right?" Sebastian asked.

"I don't know, I never considered experimenting on animals before."

"Please, can we try? Great Danes and Rottweilers don't live very long."

"What do you plan on doing with the puppies?"

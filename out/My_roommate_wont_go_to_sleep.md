I constantly hear clicking from his room that I assume is him playing games. It's non-stop and it's been reducing my sleep. I'm not sure what to think of the situation as he isn't my responsibility and it is his apartment. Should I tell him to get medication to help him sleep? I'm not really sure at this point as it has been going on for days now. I haven't slept in maybe 3 days, my eyes are getting heavy and I haven't been able to work normally. 

I'm so tired of not sleeping. I want to shut my eyes without hearing constant noises coming from the door next to me. It's been growing on me and I think I should just ask him to stop, or move out. I slowly stroll into his room and ask him politely to go to sleep. It's about two in the morning by now. He doesn't respond or even look over. By now I'm pissed off. I let out a sigh that was obviously dramatized for my pleasure. He clicks again, my head is about to explode. I walk out and just as I do, he turns his head. I keep walking back to room as I'm scared he'll look like something straight out the movies.

I open the lid of my laptop and start up google. It takes a while to load and I'm hoping it'll be worth the time. I quickly run downstairs to grab a bag of chips and start typing into the search bar. "What happens if you don't sleep for a week?" I put into the search bar. It comes up with a photo of a live video of a man. Is that my roommate? He looks like skin and bone. I walk into his room interruptedly. His head is already turned my way and this time he only has a tight t-shirt on. I can really see where this has gotten him now.

He's not skin and bone, he's muscle and bone. Some of his skin was torn off and I'm guessing by him. There's some red splatter on his posters and a voodoo doll on his dirty bedsheet. My jaw almost hits the floor in shock. I run downstairs to reach my phone and dial 911. I try to reason with the officer connected to the line. He doesn't believe me at first until I told him in all detail. My foot was already stepping outside the front door when I start to hear footsteps coming down the stairs. I run outside and to the neighbors house. I'm safe here, right?

I knock on the neighbors door and start signaling for help. Am I over-exaggerated? I don't think so, this is the right thing to do. His steps are repeating in my head while I flick my head back and forth checking if he's behind me. They open the door and I sprint inside not even looking back. I start to hear groaning from the bottom floor as I'm walking up the stairs. I hesitate to look behind me as I see the neighbors. Absolutely gutted asking for help. I let out a loud gulp and run to the closest room. At this point I'm shaking in fear. The police sirens stretch towards my house. Everything else is a blur. All I remember is waking up in my bedroom, staring at my hands. I slowly creep into my roommates room. He's asleep. I switch back to reality and... I am the roommate.

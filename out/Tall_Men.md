Tall Men

Let Me explain i have always had Paranoia as a kid especially as a teenager but it was always for no reason at all but there was one reason that made it plausible to be Paranoid and that was my window. i was utterly terrified of open windows. even more before bed and my dreams only made it worse, there was always these humanoid creatures. they have oblonged heads and lanky bodies. they always dressed in formal attire and the part that creeped me out the most is that they always smiled when i look at them. they also had deep black beady eyes and pale white skin. it looked as if they were trying to imitate a human. one night i was getting ready for bed when my father called me to pick up my band gear from the basement. i played bass so it was hard to carry my huge amp upstairs. as i was ascending the stairs i had a feeling someone was watching me. i finally finished and passed out on bed. i woke up at an unknown time, i could feel an eerie vibe around me and suddenly there in my backyard garden stood one of them with their beady eyes staring back at me. i covered myself with my blanket but could still see it and more of them, hissing and smiling at me in what i perceived to be a foggy forrest of some kind . 

I force my mind to erase this abomination from my mind but cant, they are deep within the fabric of my mind never letting go.

time passes by and as i grow i forget about them but they lurk waiting for the opportunity to ambush my brain. 

That day hits when Grandmother passes away shortly after my Graduation from High School, I have always been close to my Nana, she always used to take me to the park as a little kid and we used to get ice cream so it was to my horror when my Father spilled the news to us that my Granny was dead. she suffered  a stroke while in the shower.
She live alone as my Grandfather had died before her. 

I cried myself to sleep that night hoping that was all a bad nightmare but it wasn’t. 

the nightmare was about to begin

Suddenly there i was in a family foggy Woods surrounded by tall trees riddled with moss and spider nests. but on some trees there was the strange black ink like substance that was running off from the trees. i dare not touch it because i did not know what it was. then i heard it.

whispering from all directions of the forest. then child laughter that increasingly louder as i traversed through the woods. then i found an old beat up tool shed which was in the middle of nowhere. inside was a lantern and a tape with a note attached to it. 

Hello John you have finally arrived, i have been waiting for you since the day you were born, in this recording you will find the truth contrasting from the lies. all you’ve been told was, so listen closely and head to spot from which life begins. 

it was odd, how did whoever wrote that note now my name, and what did they mean by waiting for me since my birth. 

It was whatever but i continued on my path looking for the place where life begins. to wherever that may be

As i kept walking, it became darker snd it was at that moment when i saw a small detail i missed from the note. 

it said in small print watch out for the Tall Men

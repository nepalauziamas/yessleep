As you might have guessed I don’t know if I’m me or if this is a simulation, before you go away I swear I'm not insane and I’m most certainly not one of those crack-pot conspiracy theorists. Let me start with who I am; I am Seth Foster, a 22 year old college student. My parents are John and Sarah Foster, they own a little therapy office down the street from my college. For their safety I can’t tell you where I go to college but just bear with me as I tell you the story of how my world came crashing down on top of me. It started about a month ago; I was sitting inside my apartment working on a different story for this subreddit (It was called “We created something that's a killing machine and that's an understatement” that’s not important). 

When I got up to go to the bathroom I felt as if something about my room was off, at the moment I didn’t know but looking back I realize my apartment was mirrored (i.e. the bathroom was on the left side of my room but it was supposed to be on the right). I didn’t realize it because the same thing happened to my stuff; like my desk. It took a little while for me to adjust to the different layout of my apartment but I got there. Right after getting adjusted to my apartment I started noticing stuff going missing around my room, and it started as small stuff; a pen here, a card there. Eventually I started losing things that I needed, my wallet, my car keys, my phone, but thankfully I found them but a lot of the stuff that went missing I never found. The thing that startled me the most was, I’m not a forgetful person; I actually have an amazing memory but now I’m not so sure.

It took a week for the next thing to happen, that being, I found a wall missing, and what I saw inside wasn’t a building I saw underground I saw, what is commonly referred to as, the blue hell, that thing that happens when you fall out of the map in a video game. THE WALL WAS MISSING A TEXTURE. I had a panic attack right there in the street, right on the side of the busiest street in my city. I passed out not long after; why? I have no clue, I don't regularly have panic attacks and when I do they are very mild. I awoke to sirens and EMT’s, I tried telling them I was fine and that I only had a panic attack.

They told me that if I had a panic attack so bad I passed out for 15 minutes then I’m not fine. I’m not sure why but I decided they had to be wrong, I mean, their EMT’s, trained professionals, they had to know what they were talking about. I stayed in the hospital for a week as they tried to figure out why I had a panic attack. I decided not to tell them what I saw because they might throw me in a psych ward or something like that. They ended up taking my excuse that my girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me after I was on my way to propose to her. That story was complete bull shit but I needed to get out and they knew they weren’t going to get the truth from me.

I sat here in my room, watching people and I started to realize how robotic everyone looked. I’m starting to see some familiar faces around, no, familiar entities. 5 minutes ago I saw a man in a three piece suit walk by and I just saw him walk by again, in the same direction might I add. I can’t tell if I’m in a video game, simulation, or part of a government experiment. I don’t even know if I’m real, I think I’m going to walk through that wall to the blue hell, I will talk to you guys if I make it.

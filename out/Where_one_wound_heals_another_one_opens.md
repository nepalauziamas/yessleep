 Mallory was late; It was nearly two hours past their court-ordered pickup time. Josie and Ally were getting antsy, their stuffed teddys in hand and backpacks stuffed to the brim. 

“Did momma forget?” 

“No, Ally,” I lied. “She’s just running a bit late.” With their bedtime quickly approaching, we putzed around the lobby while I pondered what to do. Six phone calls went straight to voicemail. I sighed heavily, my mind jumping to the most terrifying, but logical conclusion. 

I decided. She didn't leave me much of a choice.

“Okay, kids. I’ve got a surprise.”

There was a temporary glimmer in their bored, glazed-over eyes.

“Surprise sleepover with Nanny!”

Ally grinned, letting out a cheer. 

Josie rolled her eyes. Under her breath, she whispered, “I guess she really did forget…”

After a quick phone call to grandma, the kids were sent upstairs to change into their pajamas and unpack their things. Grandma dropped everything and was over in less than 20 minutes. I graciously hugged her goodbye, leaving some money on the counter for late-night snacks. 

“Leon,” she called out as I slipped on my jacket.

“Yes, mom?”

“Be careful.”

\*\*\*

The highway did its best to try to soothe the tumultuous swirl of thoughts in my mind. The roads were peaceful, the radio turned off. Streetlamp after streetlamp. Exit after exit. I tried my best to clear my head, to remain calm. It was difficult because late-night driving had always been a time for reflection, and the ghosts from the past kept resurfacing.

*It was an honest mistake.*

*It’s fine.* 

*She’s just forgotten.*

I paid the toll and passed through the turnpike, all the while the lump in my throat never settled. 

This was her week. She never missed her week without some kind of notice. Especially considering how hard she had battled for custody, all the progress she had made, there was no way in hell she would jeopardize everything.

The gate to Scenic Acres was wide open. It was rusted and weathered—well past its time, like many of its residents. It was a quiet community, which was exactly why Mallory had chosen it— fewer opportunities to get into trouble and fewer reasons to be out late. All the houses looked the same in the twilight: cedar-shake rooftops and bungalow-style homes with faded vinyl siding in soft grey and blue tones. 

The car came to a crawl as I poked my head out the window. I squinted to see the house numbers:

501….503…505

Once I turned the corner towards Mallory’s place, I noticed the lights were off on #515. The street along the block was lined with cars. I parked down the road and walked towards the home, my heart fluttering. The doorbell buzzed. I waited another moment before ringing it again, knocking a few more times for good measure. 

“Mallory!”

No response.

I drifted towards the side of the house and peered into the window. One of the plants looked like it hadn't been watered in weeks. And was that a chair toppled over?

The scene inside the house triggered the flashbacks: her body on the floor in a puddle of vomit, shallow breathing before she faded out. Her eyes were seared in my memory forever: the emptiness within them, completely vacant of life. And I could do nothing but cry. She was gone. 

Somehow the paramedics managed to pull off a miracle. They shocked the life back into her, pulling her back from a place unknown. Those seconds had felt like decades, whimpering in a heap beside her body. 

I was not going to let that happen again. 

I ran for the back gate and stood on my tippy toes, dangling my hands over the top. I fished for the carabiner, eventually fumbling it open with a satisfying click. The door swung open to reveal a jungle of grass. The wild blades swayed in a strange wave, riding the gust of wind.

I shut the door to the backyard and hollered her name. Shorts had been a poor choice for the evening–the grass was sticky and a cloud of mosquitos hovered around my body, latching onto any bit of exposed skin. I felt a pinch on my calf and swatted my leg in a feeble attempt to scare them off.

“Mallory!”

I cleared the corner, catching a glimpse of the faint glow coming from the basement. Stumbling up the back porch in a panicked haste, I tried my luck with the doorbell again. I knocked aggressively, the thuds echoing in the night, but there was still no answer. Just as I prepared to send my elbow through one of the windows, the door creaked open.

The darkness was endless beyond the door; I could barely make out the figure. If it wasn’t for his bleach-dyed hair he would have blended in with the sea of shadows.

“What do you want?” the voice asked.

“Where the fuck is Mallory, Chase? Is she okay?”

“She’s fine, Leon. We’re busy right now, though. I’ll have her give you a call later tonight.” As he closed the door, Leon wedged his arm into the gap. 

“She missed pickup, Chase. Her week was supposed to start today.” 

“Ahh, really?” he said with feigned sadness. “Shit, I’m really sorry.” 

“You sure she’s alright? This schedule isn't new.  I had the kids all ready to go and everything, you should have seen their faces.”

He pushed, but I managed to wrestle the door open.

The droopy figure of Chase stood there stupidly,  helpless and out of breath. He looked like a toothpick, his bare chest sunken, his baggy cargo shorts barely hanging on to his bony hips. But it was his eyes that were most disturbing–they were a milky pink, like two partially sucked gumballs. It made me shudder as I walked into the home.

“For God’s sake. I knew it. You two are using again!” I stormed down the hall and into the darkness.

“You’re nothing but a goddamn junkie, Chase. I knew it. But I’m not letting you drag her down with you. Mallory! Where are you?”

“Get out of our house,” Chase ordered. Suddenly I felt a hand claw at my neck in the dark. It felt clammy as I shrugged it off. As my eyes adjusted, I felt around the wall for a light switch. Before I could find it, I spotted the dull puddle of light creeping in from underneath the basement door.

“*Our* house?” I scoffed back, leaving him behind. “I paid for the friggin thing.”

“Leon, Leave!!” Chase pleaded. But I was already down the stairs.

\*\*\*

An odd funnel of air hit me, with every creaking step it got progressively warmer. The air seemed to cling to my body like a layer of honey, carrying a gurgling stench of wet laundry. A sickly hissing sound could be heard from the dying furnace off in the distance. I could make out the source of the light now— numerous candles were laid across the floor with no discernable pattern. Piercing red orbs of light were found in every corner of the room. The heat lamps were radiating waves of sweltering heat that made the walls sweat. When I finally got to the bottom of the stairwell, she was lying there, face up.

“Mallory!” I cried.

She was stiff and unresponsive, her eyes rolled back in her skull. The floor was no longer concrete like I had remembered, she lay on an earthy layer of sediment that was soft and squishy. The moisture from the soil wet my bare knees as I crouched over Mallory’s body. I felt for a pulse, shocked by the scene that I had prayed I would never relive. 

She wasn’t the only one.  There were other bodies spread out haphazardly around the room.

“Do not touch her,” a voice commanded. “You are disrupting the process.”

“What did you do to her?” I screamed. “To…To…all of *them*?”

I noticed before he could answer. The dark bruises on Mallory’s body were like pools of oil. They were dark islands along her alabaster-white skin. The inky blotches ran up her thigh and across her abdomen. Rage began to erupt inside of me.

”Me?” he mocked. “I did nothing. Nothing at all. *They,* however, are doing us a service. Quite frankly, It’s *them* you should be thanking. They are doing what you could never do.” He pointed in Mallory’s direction. 

“You son of a bitch,” I growled.

“Just look.”

I didn't see them at first, the fury was blinding my concentration. All I could think about was putting my fist through Chase's face. I would wring his little neck out when all of this was over, and if she didn't make it, then God help him, my rage would have no end. Mallory was still unresponsive. When I lifted her head up slightly, gently cradling it under my arm, only then did I see them start to sway. It was the same ripple effect that could be seen on a hot summer day: the sun’s rays refracting off the pavement in a strange, wavy illusion. Their movement was the only thing that made them visible, it caused a distortion between the dim glow of the candlelight that washed over the basement. If you blinked too quickly you could almost miss it. Tiny angel-hair thin strings of translucent fibers were undulating back and forth like the tall blades of grass in the wind. They were sprouting up from tiny pores in Mallory’s skin, wriggling around in a hypnotic dance before dipping in and out of her like an animal at a watering hole. I couldn’t tell whether they were coming or going, only that they were crawling all over her body. 

Acidy liquid came up out of my throat as I watched a group of them wiggle out of her eyes. 

I made a sound I had never made before, akin to a yelp from a tiny dog. The sound escaped from my quivering lips and was met by a high-pitched hiss

“See what you’ve done now?  You’ve angered *them*. You fool.”

Chase crept up alongside her body as I found myself further and further away. I could feel the little boy inside of me urging me to run. 

“What the fuck, Chase?”

There was a knocking coming from the walls that I couldn't pinpoint in the shadows.

Chase wrapped an elastic band around Mallory's arm and jabbed her with a syringe. The contents slowly drained out of the needle. The hissing intensified as the ripples became stronger, I could see the little hairs on their bodies as my eyes adjusted to their figure. They dived inside of her. In and out. Sucking and sucking until they waved their thin frames from side to side in a temporary, triumphant jiggle before proceeding to feed again. I noticed now that the bruises seemed to be moving, ever so slightly.

“*Feast*,” Chase encouraged in a breathy whisper. “Take it all away —the chemicals, the toxins, the dependency.” He laid down beside Mallory and strapped himself up before sinking a needle into his arm. 

Another frenzy of loud knocks sent my gaze upwards. From the basement window above, I could see them pounding,  desperately trying to get in. They were much more visible given the numbers of them crowded by the window. Their bodies were clear like jellyfish, their mouths twisting and turning, their tiny teeth spread out and swirling like the head of a beautiful flower. Long, puffy tubes of flesh that looked as big as your hand.

It was enough to send me scampering up the stairs. Going off memory, I felt around the pitch-dark room. A picture frame tumbled from the wall, the glass shattering on impact. I felt an electric shock of pain as my hip collided with the bench in the foyer. It felt like an eternity before I finally felt the knob to the front door. Once free from the house, I did not breathe until I was back in my vehicle. 

It was a long ride home.

\*\*\*

I received a phone call a couple of hours later. Mallory was apologizing profusely, reassuring me that everything was okay, that she was trying something new that seemed to be working. She promised to make it up to me and the kids.

When she arrived the next morning she looked amazing. Her hair looked fuller, her smile radiant. The bags under her eyes seemed to be gone, but the bruising was impossible to hide. There was a speckle of dark purple around her collar bone that poked out of her cardigan.

“I know it's a little…out of the box, Leon. But I’m telling you, it's been working, like nothing else I’ve tried before. That gnawing feeling, you know, that urge that picks away at you….it’s completely gone. It’s been amazing. I finally feel free.”

“*Out of the box,”* I laughed. “Did he tell you that he shot you up while you were passed out? I thought you were clean, Mallory. Hell, I thought you were dead. It’s not okay.”

The kids were gathering up their things upstairs, their excited voices traveling down to the foyer. Chase was waiting in the car outside.

“That’s part of it…for now. At least until we build up enough clientele and have a large enough stable.”

Leon shot a puzzled look in her direction. “What the fuck are you talking about, Mallory?”

“A stable, you know. I guess you could call it our new business venture,” she smiled. “It’s not too late to invest. We already have a handful of clients, those people that you saw yesterday.” She stopped by the front window and flashed an open palm to Chase, indicating 5 more minutes. He looked unimpressed.

“Anyways, Chase thinks it could get really big. We’re looking into the potential market, hopefully, we can sell the bigger ones once they mature. Eventually, they become too big for the detox process and become useless. We’ve just been housing them in the backyard until they eventually die. Bug farming is the next big thing, Leon. It’s going to make big waves in the protein market.

I couldn't believe what I was hearing. At a loss for words, I just sighed.

She leaned in and hugged me tightly. I suddenly felt warm. “Thanks again for checking up on me last night.”

There was playful cooing coming from the top of the stairs followed by frantic footsteps as the girls raced down.

“Grab your things and head to the car,” Mallory ordered. They hugged their dad goodbye and ran to the vehicle.

”What exactly were those things, anyway?” I asked. Peering out the front window, Ally was showing Chase her brand new keyboard. 

“To be honest, Leon. I don't know. I think some of them traveled back with me. You remember my Ayahuasca retreat a couple of months ago?”

I nodded. The much-anticipated trip to Costa Rica. ”Keep them away from the bugs, Mallory. I’m dead serious.”

“Of course, of course,” she smiled.

Before she left, she gently clutched my arm, “Thanks again. Seriously,” she winked. “I’ll bring them back bright and early for you. Have a good week.”

She left before I could tell her. 

I wanted to tell her that my calf had swelled up last night. I wanted to tell her that the bruise had seemingly traveled to my thigh overnight. 

I wanted to tell her so many things.

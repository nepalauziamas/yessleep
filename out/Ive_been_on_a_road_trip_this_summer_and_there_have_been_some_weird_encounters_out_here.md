Society has an odd relationship with mental health these days. One day, it may be touting how we all need to “understand our struggles” and “love each other,” and then the next day it terminates you for the social crime of having a nervous breakdown. Then we, the people who get caught in between a rock and a hard place, are left feeling abandoned and wanting *to* abandon. 

That is essentially where I was the day I finally took off. As soon as I had sent that last email out to my supervisor and professors, hugged my parents and brother goodbye, and the tires of my little box of a car met the county line, I finally felt the first vestiges of the anxiety, depression, and hypomania begin to dissipate for the first time in…hell, more than a year. 

It wasn’t the work, not really. I truly cared for my clients, each and every damn one of them. I was – if you’ll indulge me just a little, apologies – a damn fine clinician, even for one in training. The therapeutic connection we each made during each session, no matter how that session went, was quite literally the only aspect of my professional (and to some extent, personal) life that was not actively sending me into a burnout-fueled spiral to the Tartarus of my mind. When it came to that aspect, accolades often followed suit. I don’t say this to brag at all, but to give you a picture of how I even ended up in this crazy friggin’ situation.

Nah. You know how some goofs say in their first ever job interviews that their biggest problem was that they simply “care too much”? Well, shoot if that wasn’t exactly it.

But it was not quite what you might be imagining. Counter-transference is an all-too-real deal, and some of us can handle it, while others simply cannot. It took me nearly a year to admit to myself that I fell in the latter category, though the sense of freedom when all was laid bare was second only to actually leaving.

Anyways. That’s what brought me here, holed up at the best motel – also the only motel – in a small Pennsylvania town with a shotgun and holy oil at my side. The moon shadow is keeping me safe on this clear night, so at the very least something up above has allowed me the chance to tell you all what’s lurking out on those lonely county roads. 

It began a couple of weeks ago. I had been on the road just for just short of a week at this point, driving down to eastern Kentucky for the first leg of my half-planned spirit quest, eager at the opportunity to lose myself in the satin-teal colored wilderness. My eyes were glued to the dew-dampened pavement, but my mind was…outside of itself. At least, that’s what it felt like. 

The evening redness of the setting sun danced and tickled its way through the canopic forest on either side of my thin stretch of road, and as I glanced sporadically into the old land around me I could have *sworn* I heard whisperings coming from somewhere deep within those woods. With no other cars or trucks around me, I made a decidedly foolish choice born of some combination of feeling numbed to any more bullshit and sheer curiosity.

I pulled over on a convenient shoulder and got out of my car. 

Maybe it was because the whispers sounded familiar. Hell, I would swear even now that a few of them were those of friends who have passed, people who I knew were now beyond my ability to talk to, let alone see, on this plane of existence.

Had I been whole, or at least less shattered, perhaps I would have caught myself then and there. I wasn’t afraid, but neither was I thinking. My mind felt hazy. Not brain fog, but something more invasive, pulling me further from the safety of my car and deeper into the forest. 

I remember walking on some ancient game trail, the soft underbelly of the temperate rainforest muffling my robotic movement forward. I remember the whispers building in a gradual intensity, to the point where I found myself talking gibberish in a vain attempt to deny them. 

I remember being utterly blinded and shocked to the point of rigidity by a searing blast of blue-white light, and a sensation akin to taking a swan dive off of a sheer cliff, the hot wind rushing across my body – *but wasn’t it a calm and cool night?* – and thinking vaguely that this was probably how birds and suicidal jumpers felt. 

That sensation increased in perfect harmony with the whispers, which at this point were as close by and intimate as a lover, though instead of a warm embrace I felt a crushing fear as never before in my existence. It felt like I was simultaneously dying and being reborn, over and over again for beyond eternity, and that I was doomed to this limbo for my past sins and failures. 

Then I blinked and found myself standing next to my car once more, right as I had been just before those first steps of my spontaneous night hike. 

The bit that shook me was that *now* it was parked not by the side of the road in the middle of a densely forested area, but rather in a gas station lot at the edge of a dimly lit town. The magenta neon of the BEER HERE sign basked us in its gaze. To my right were a quartet of pumps, standing their vigil under a grouping of faded yellowing light bulbs, while to my left leaned a leather-jacketed woman in dark sunglasses mindfully gazing at the night’s sky between drags of her cigarette.

My mind was still in that strange, swoony fugue, yet I was regaining enough wits to check out where the hell I even was. Not to mention that I also found my body wracked with exhaustion I felt through to my very bones, and not exactly born from sitting in the car all day. 

Of course, I was also pretty damn concerned as to precisely *how* I ended up wherever I did, but my logical brain was trying like hell to convince my lizard brain that this was explained by some sort of psychological relieving of built-up stressors. Stranger things have happened, after all, and we already know the relationship between truth and fiction.

I blinked in rapid succession a few more times, partly to help refocus on my surroundings and partly just to see if I would suddenly find myself in a new part of the country with each reopening of my eyes. God apparently saw fit to spare me that at least, so I turned my attention to the only other apparent human being still awake in this town. 

“‘Scuse me, sorry, this is gonna sound weird…” I began asking the young woman.

She looked about my age, a few years younger, but it was hard to tell for sure with her vantablack shades hiding her eyes. As I started talking, she craned her neck with only the slightest movement to look at, me, giving me a practiced smirk that would make anyone stop dead. 

While she was admittedly quite striking (of course I’ve always been a sucker for cropped leather jackets on women), especially the way the shitty neon bounced off of her alabaster features, I again internally smacked myself out of it and returned to what I had been trying to say.

“Oof, don’t know what happened there. Been a long day,” I said. 

In response the woman’s smirk went wider and she shrugged her shoulders as if to say, “*Yeah no shit dude you look like you just ran out of the woods, and smell like it too.”*

“Anyways yeah this is gonna sound weird, but I think I had some sort of, eh, mental brownout or something ya know? Last thing I recall is driving down the interstate trying to get through these great Kentucky wilds!” 

My attempt at lightening the mood aside, the leather-clad woman continued to hold her pose, wisps of smoke and clumps of ash gathering around her. At this point I really couldn’t care less what quirks this stranger had as long as she gave me something to work with. 

“So yeah uh, heh, where the *hell* am I, I guess I’m trying to ask,” I finally got out. 

God, but I almost wish she hadn’t answered. Then again, if she did not, it is very likely that I would be in far greater danger now.

Instead, the woman straightened from her casual lean, and with a coolness my awkward self could never hope to match dipped her sunglasses below her eyes, revealing a pair of swirling orbs that seemed to hold the mysteries of the universe themselves. At a layman’s glance, one might mistake them for just an odd shade of turquoise eyes with maybe a hint of purple if the light caught them fight, but I held no doubt in my mind that the galactic colorations of hers had enraptured many a person’s undivided attention.

“Well, I do indeed have *some* answers which you seek,” she finally spoke in a singsong voice that belied her age and appearance.

“However, I quite doubt you will be satisfied with these answers alone,” she finished.

Again, I was just frazzled enough to be forward for once in my life. I was unsure if she was speaking in riddles intentionally or if something was indeed cognitively off with me.

“Lay it on me, then,” I said.

The woman dug her cigarette into the wall of the small c-store and looked at me once more with those foreign eyes. For the first time since she began staring me down, her smirk faded and in its place gave me a pitying frown. 

“As you wish. Fortunate for you then that you ran into me out of everyone in this place, though it *is* unfortunate that you…” she said, trailing off.

A twisting gutshot of anxiety formed within me at her words. As if I had known all along, yet the incomprehensible nature of it being so blocked my psyche from realizing the truth.

“Yeah? Unfortunate for me *what*?”

Those cosmic eyes flicked at me. 

“I’m sorry to say, but you’re not exactly in Kentucky anymore.”

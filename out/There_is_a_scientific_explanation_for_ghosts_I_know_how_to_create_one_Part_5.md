I can put together a timeline of the rest of that day from a couple of pieces of evidence I just took out of a storage box. They’re sitting in front of me as I type this. Handling them again after all this time gave me a jolt of unpleasant PTSD. I even felt a sudden fear of the outside, something I thought was long dead and buried. 

One of the objects is a wooden clipboard with a metal clip. There are still sheets of lined paper clipped to it, slightly yellowed and wrinkled from age. The top page contains a single line, in my handwriting: “01:38 Door creak (2).”

The other object is a hand-held tape recorder with a cassette inside it. At some point in my teen years, I’d started recording an audio diary. I always thought I’d done it in imitation of the show *Felicity*, but checking the dates now, that show didn’t premiere until later that year. I guess I’d been ahead of my time. 

At any rate, that afternoon, I couldn’t shake the weightless, invisible mice from my mind, so I decided to engage in one of my rather eccentric hobbies. I grabbed the clipboard, a pair of headphones, a boom microphone, and a DAT machine – which was kind of an intermediary technology between analog and fully digital, recording sound onto tapes that looked like consumer cassettes, only smaller.

I spent a lot of my free time building a library of sound effects for future documentary films, an idea I got after seeing John Travolta in *Blow Out*. It may seem like a hopelessly naive thing to have done, but believe it or not, I recently used some of those very effects in a recent project. So there! 

I found a door that creaked to a satisfactory degree, one that led to an empty room. It would do. I pressed “record” on my DAT machine, held the boom mic near the door, and opened and closed it twice. I recorded that effect on my clipboard.

Next, I wanted to get the whirring of one of the hallway ceiling fans. I held the boom as close to the rotating blades as I could without hitting them, and pressed “record” again. The sound was good and clean.

But then I heard something else: a voice. A female voice. Faint. Barely audible, in fact.

“Lacey.” 

My eyes widened. I pulled the boom down and whirled around. 

“Lacey,” the voice said, a little louder now. “Lacey.”

“Who’s there?” I asked, my own voice sounding tremulous. I started walking down the hall with the boom, still recording.

“Lacey,” the voice said again. “Danger. Get out.”

“Who is that?” I demanded. I stopped in the hall and held the boom upright. I waited. But there were no more voices. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Moments later, I was back in my bedroom, with the DAT hooked up to a couple of speakers. I rewound the tape and pressed “play.” 

I heard the door creaking, twice. I heard the ceiling fan. I heard myself saying “Who’s there?” and “Who is that?” 

But that was all the audio on that tape. Frustrated, I grabbed my other tape recorder to record a diary entry. I just played it now, in order to transcribe it here. It was eerie hearing my sixteen-year-old voice. Here’s what I said:

*July ninth, nineteen ninety-eight. So I'm in Grandpa's house now. Just had my first session with him this morning. It went okay, I guess. But there's some weird shit going on in this house . . . Or is there? Maybe it's all in your head. That wouldn't be anything new, would it? Maybe it's all your subconscious telling you to leave. Maybe, deep down, you don't want to be cured. Maybe you want to stay crazy for the rest of your life.*

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I stood on a footstool outside my bedroom, drilling a hole in the wall with an electric drill. I’d scavenged both items from the house, opting to not ask Grandpa for permission, lest he have inconvenient questions. He didn’t seem to ever come to this wing of the house, and if he did, I doubt he’d even notice this little project of mine.

Once the hole was done, I screwed a little rotating mount into the wall above my door and attached a tiny video camera to it. I fed the cord through the hole I just drilled, and attached it to my TV. I picked up a remote control device and pressed the “on” button. I got a decent black-and-white image of the area just outside my bedroom, the camera panning back and forth slowly. 

I went into the hall, returned to my bedroom, rewound the tape, and saw the image of myself. I couldn’t help but think that I looked frail and vulnerable on my TV screen, the house itself like a gaping maw.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Before going to bed, I went downstairs to make myself a glass of chocolate milk, and to say goodnight to Grandpa. 

I found him in his study. A deerskin head and assorted taxidermy implements were scattered on  his desk, which was lined with newspaper. He was referring to a diagram, and applying clay to a wooden mannequin deer head. He looked up when I entered with my chocolate milk.

“How are you feeling?” he asked.

I don’t think I replied. I was distracted by the deerskin, which I fingered gingerly. “Grandpa, why do you kill animals?” I blurted out.

Grandpa chuckled. “You think I am a bad guy? I only hunt for food, not sport. And I don't use a gun, only bow and arrow and traps.”

“Okay, then, why do you stuff them?” I challenged him.

“The Indians believed animals voluntarily sacrificed themselves for the hunter,” Grandpa said, mildly. “So when they killed an animal, they did prayer and gave gifts so his soul could be reborn. When I stuff an animal, that is my gift to him. His body can live on, and every time I look, I will remember his sacrifice.”

“I dunno,” I said. “They're creepy. I feel like they're staring at me.”

“Ha ha! They're only glass eyes.” Grandpa beckoned me over to take a closer look. “This is like art, you know, taxidermy. Look, right now I am forming his muscles with clay. This mannequin -- you can buy them in stores, but I make my own of wood. When this is done, I will glue the skin on it, do some finishing touches with wax and oil paint, then bang! Bambi is ready for my wall. Hee hee!”

“Well, I guess it's like you said about me and my AV equipment,” I said.

“What did I say?”

“Everybody has a hobby, I suppose.”

\*\*\*\*\*

That night, I bolted my bedroom door shut, and turned on my improvised surveillance system. I left the TV on so I could monitor the hall throughout the night.

After finally falling into, at best, a half-sleep, I felt a presence in the room again, and raised my head to look at the foot of my bed.

The two women were there again. Once again, I was struck by how they evoked a different feeling in me than the other apparitions: not one of fear. Then again, they were still apparitions.

I slowly reached for my Polaroid and snapped a picture of the women. They seemed unfazed, still sitting there motionless, smiling placidly at me.

While I waited for the photo to develop, I reached for a flashlight I’d left on my bedside table for precisely this occasion. I flicked it on, and shone the beam directly at the women.

They were gone.

I angled the beam onto the now-developed Polaroid picture. Predictably, there were no women in it.

I glanced over at my TV, and the moving image of the hall. My mouth was dry, and I’d forgotten to leave a glass of water by my bed, as I usually did. Somewhat hesitantly, I got out of bed, unbolted my door, and left the room, carrying my flashlight with me.

I stepped into the hall, dark and foreboding, and looked around. To my right was the bathroom. To my left– I stopped short.

Someone was standing there. 

It was a tall, shadowy figure. I was certain of it. It stood perfectly still, and I couldn’t make out any of its features. I aimed my flashlight in its direction. The beam was strong, cutting through the darkness like a knife, and revealing . . . absolutely nothing.

I was getting sick of this shit. I turned around and made my way towards the bathroom. I turned on the light, filled a cup with tap water, and started drinking, looking at my reflection in the mirror. My attention turned to the closed shower curtain, and once again, I had the illogical feeling that someone was standing in the tub.

I turned around slowly, and stared at it. *Don’t do it, Lacey*, a voice inside me said. Ignoring the voice, I reached out and whipped open the curtain.

Nothing there. Furious at myself, I shut the curtain again.

I stepped out of the bathroom, not turning off the light, letting it spill into the hall. Maybe I’d leave the bathroom light on, like a little kid. No shame in that, right?

Something compelled me to walk over to the staircase landing. I was too scared to use my flashlight, but the bathroom light illuminated just enough that I could see a few steps down. What I saw there was one of many indelible images from that house that still haunt me to this day. 

A naked man was crawling up the staircase on his belly, like some kind of slithery animal. I stood frozen as he made his way up the last steps. Bone-white and gaunt, he pulled himself up over the final step with a groan, then spit up a giant mouthful of thick, red blood.

My scream might have reached Minnesota. I dropped my flashlight, whirled around, and dashed back into the bathroom, where I locked the door and leaned my back against it, breathing heavily, eyes wide and terrified.

I didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t.

For a third time, I stared at that damned shower curtain. Why did I keep closing it? I was just freaking myself out. I decided I was going to keep it permanently open, even if it gathered mildew from being bunched together. So for a third time, I slid that curtain open. 

This time, someone was there. Another naked man. He was covered in angry purple bruises, as well as several cuts that leaked blood.

I screamed again, unlocked the door and ran out into the hall – a hall that was now teeming with people. Men and women, young and old, many defaced or disfigured in some way, all nude. Creeping and crawling out of the shadows. Reaching for me and moaning.

I covered my face and ran down the hall, screaming non-stop.

A tall man, bleeding from a gaping neck wound, blocked my path. I turned around to run in the other direction, only to be blocked again, this time by an obese woman, bloated and blue, as if she'd been drowned.

All I could do was cower against the wall, shrinking down into a ball.

In the distance came the most horrifying sound I’d ever heard. A man screaming non-stop with a guttural, animalistic rage. The people started to fade into the shadows, as if in deference. 

A nightmare burst into view at the end of the hall. The screaming man. Long, straggly hair came out of his scalp in patches. Sinewy muscles all over his body rippled as he ran. Sharp teeth jutted out of his constantly-open mouth. He wielded a gigantic knife. He was death, murder, fury embodied.

He came to a stop, towering above me, and raised the knife above his head with both hands, continuing to scream, constantly, unintelligibly.

I covered my face with my hands, so that all I’d see when my life ended was blackness.

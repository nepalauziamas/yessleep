So last night I woke up every hour and fifteen minutes for some reason (i know this sounds unbelievably specific but that was also my first reaction) and I was about to go to sleep the second time after I woke up but I heard some sort of scraping or rustling in my bedroom from the foot of my bed, and my door was cracked open but id day it was at least forearm length open which confused me. The rustling sounded like something sort of big or heavy so I immediately scrambled to the top of my bed and vrapped my phone for the light and when I turned the light on the rusteling immediately stopped and my room went dead silent, except for one thing that was off, my bedroom window was open so I naturally closed it again after checking all around my room and just to be safe even the wardrobe (bear in mind I locked the window before going to sleep)

After closing my window and locking it again I turned made my way downstairs making sure to hear my bedroom door making sure to hear the latch snap up and gave it a little shimmy (ritual every time I close my door) and went downstairs to get a light snack and get a drink before heading back to sleep, but when I went down the door to my living room was open, now I was obviously confused AND concerned just incase somebody was in my house but still it was too quiet.

After having a bite to eat I went back upstairs to find my bedroom door was wide open, which again left me confused because first it was the rustling and the door slightly open, and now the door is completely open (there was no draft to push the door and it doesn't really move on its own, plus i mentioned that i heard the latch snap up) so after closing it and checking both my window and door once more I managed to get back to sleep after about twenty or so minutes, but woke up again at around quater to four, and I was absolutely terrified to realize my bedroom window was wide open again after I checked it before going to sleep.

I couldn't get back to sleep after this so I just decided to watch some Netflix for a while and when I looked up to see how bright it was outside my window was open again, and now I'm obviously not sure what's happening and I'm full on shook now so I just left the light on and carried on watching Netflix.

The concerning part is I don't sleepwalk at all so i couldnt have opened my window or doors during my sleep and I usually have a full six hours of sleep a night but last night was so restless for me, and I can't explain the hour and fifteen minutes thing because I did my daily routine which dies t really change much except on Friday night and Saturday night, and even then that doesn't really have any lasting impact over the weekdays or Sunday/  Monday night.

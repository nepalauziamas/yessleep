Alright, let me start by saying I don't believe in paranormal stuff. I do, however, believe in unexplainable phenomena and that could be anything including what happened at the truck stop I used to work at.

It was an ordinary, boring night at Rigg's (the owner's name was Darrel Riggs and I guess he liked the similarity with Rigs like 'Big Rigs') truck stop. I was a cashier but I also stocked the shelves, cleaned the windows, changed out the trash bins and ate my fair share of truck stop food. When I was first hired, Darrel told me that cameras were in place, but none of them worked, so I figured I could eat as long as it wasn't a noticeable amount.

Anyway, that night I was falling asleep at the register. It was probably around 1 AM (I worked the graveyard shift) and it was deader than roadkill. I hadn't seen someone come through for a couple hours and not even the truckers sleeping in the parking lot came inside. The faint but annoying music over the speakers was lulling me to sleep despite its droning tone.

Headlights flashed outside and woke me up. When I looked through the window, I saw a semi rolling past the side of the building; it went all the way around the back and came to a stop on the opposite side. The truck stop had an almost complete panorama of windows which made it nearly impossible for me to miss anything fishy. The semi was odd; it had a gray tractor (the cab) and it was hauling a tanker. Normally that wouldn't be that odd, but I didn't recognize the strange branding on the side.

It said, "Carrison Transports." The logo was a hand gripping some kind of bone. The truck didn't have as many lights as I usually see on a big rig and as I watched the driver get out - he seemed in a hurry.

I stepped away from the side door (where he parked) and walked to the register. I assumed the whole transaction would be quick and painless. The man barreled past the counter towards the back near the coolers. I caught a couple details about him as he breezed by. First of all, he was short and stocky. Secondly, he was wearing a gray and light-blue plaid shirt with a few red blotches on it. I still hadn't gotten the best look at his face, but he was wearing a black hat, forward facing with the same truck logo on it.

He spent an awfully long time near the coolers. I almost asked if he needed assistance but he swiftly came back with a bag of ice. Now I could see the true urgency in his eyes. He was sweating, profusely and his eyes were bloodshot. He had a large, bushy beard with patches of hair missing.

He still hadn't engaged with me and he spent some time perusing the pocket knives. Eventually I asked, "Anything I can help you find?"

He shot up as if he didn't know I was there the entire time and stammered as he spoke, "Uh - uh - uh y - yeah! C - can I g - get one of t - these knives?" He asked while pointing his dirt covered finger to the display case.

"Sure, which one?" I asked calmly.

"T - that one right t - there. The one w - with the w - wolf." He was visibly shaking; it appeared he hadn't slept for a long time.

I opened the case and grabbed the knife, but before checking him out, I asked, "Is everything alright tonight?"

He stared directly at me for about five seconds before looking back down at the counter, "Y - yup! J - just a l - long night!"

It was hard to believe him, but he wasn't the first strange encounter I had ever had at the truck stop. "Right on, so just the knife and the ice?"

"Y - yeah… WAIT!" He suddenly shouted before slamming his palms against the counter, "I forgot something!" He added while turning around to waddle into one of the aisles.

I tried to get a glimpse of what he was looking for, but he returned almost as soon as he left. He all but threw a package of skittles on the counter before turning his gaze to me. "All set now?" I asked quietly.

"That s - should be it." He answered softly but with a vocal tremble.

"Cool, that'll be $49.63 - cash or credit?"

"How much?!" He asked loudly.

"$49.63? You're buying a knife man, that's not some cheap souvenir. You've got ice and skittles as well, so…"

He seemed to calm down, "Yeah, that… makes sense." Then he pulled a wallet out and produced a fifty-dollar bill. He handed it to me and said, "Keep the change."

"Sure thing. Do you want a bag?" I asked quickly.

"N - no. No bag." He said before gathering his things up in his arms and beginning to walk away.

"Well, have a good night. I take it you're not resting for the night?"

He stopped briefly and said, "I can't stay. No time. I need to… keep moving." He sounded solemn, but I couldn't put my finger on why.

I slowly stepped out from behind the counter to watch the trucker leave. It gave me peace of mind to know who came and went, so I wanted to see him either stay or leave.

But, I saw something I could have NEVER expected to see.

The trucker had somehow unlatched the back of the tanker and the latch was up. He threw the bag of ice into the back and then acted as if he was startled by something. Whatever it was; it made him run to the front of his truck for a time.

While he was up there, I watched a body pull itself out of the back and onto the ground. It was missing the lower half of its body and had no clothing. Despite that fact, I couldn't recognize any discernible features.

The body quickly pulled itself under the tanker and it was just as the trucker reappeared to seal the latch. I couldn't bring myself to say anything because quite frankly, I was in shock. 

The trucker turned and looked at me before once again running to the front of his truck, shifting into gear and driving away.

And the body was nowhere to be seen.

I'm not sure how I missed it, but somehow it managed to disappear. Well, unless it was just some kind of exhausted hallucination.

I stood at the side door for a few minutes trying to process what happened. Eventually I turned around and headed back to the counter to take my post. The Eagles were playing over the radio and their mainstream hit 'Hotel California' was bringing me to that tiresome state (not because the music is boring, if anything it was peaceful.)

Unfortunately, I can't just sleep when I want to working at Rigg's, even if nothing is happening work wise.

The sensation of needing to use the bathroom suddenly arose and I swiftly dismissed myself. However, just as I was about to push through the door, I saw a trail of something on the tile floor.

It dragged from the side door to the storage room and upon close inspection; it was blood albeit congealed and old. There was a handprint on the door that went outside and another on the storage room door. I stared down the short hall that leads to storage and listened…

Something was rummaging through the shelves.

The urge to use the bathroom left me and was replaced with that feeling you get when you turn off the light in an old basement. I took two steps down the hall and the rummaging stopped prompting me to stop as well.

Then, I heard a dragging sound like shoes scuffing against the floor. I realized far too late that I was in imminent danger and just as the thought entered my mind, the door to the storage room began to creak open.

My instincts told me to run. And so, I did. I ran to the coolers and hid in the frigid stocking room behind them. It probably wasn't my best choice but I had no idea what awaited me beyond that door and abandoning the register could lead to the place being robbed.

I tried to peer through the cooler glass into the store but I didn't have that good of an angle on the hallway or the side door.

But I wouldn't need one because unbeknownst to me, my adversary had already made its way to the front of the coolers.

I caught movement in my peripheral vision and as I looked down, I almost yelled which would NOT have been ideal. It was that body, the one that crawled out of the back of the tanker truck.

And it was seething.

The body was deteriorated and in complete shambles. Feasibly, it shouldn't have been able to move at all but it was dragging itself along the ground with an ease I'd think improbable. It had wispy strands of hair on a decomposing scalp, empty eye sockets, fingers with the bones exposed, no legs and deep gashes across its entire back.

It slowly raised its head and turned to face me. I wasn't sure why I was worried about whether it could see me or not, but I still hoped it couldn't. It opened its disheveled mouth and snapped its teeth together in the air while appearing to sniff. I remained still and shaking - both from the cold and from my terror.

The creature then turned away from the coolers and began to drag itself back towards the side door, or at least in the direction of it. I moved to a place where I could safely watch it without making as much noise as possible. It gradually made its way to the side door but by the time it reached it, its body was too low for me to see. However, I was able to see the door swing open slowly before closing shortly after.

I waited, freezing for a good ten minutes for ANY signs of it before leaving the coolers. As soon as I thought the coast was clear, I left and immediately called the police. I called my boss as well who didn't answer.

The police arrived and were understandably skeptical but that was only until they watched the security footage. They CLEARLY saw what I had and were equally terrified and confused. A crime scene investigator came and examined the blood trail. They said that while it WAS human blood; it had something else in it, something they had never seen before.

The police also told me that the trucking company didn't exist - the one on the side of that semi. They asked if I could have possibly been mistaken but I assured them of my certainty. I was able to give them details of the driver but they weren't enough for them to go on and without a license plate; they couldn't track the truck.

Needless to say, I quit that night. That thing may have left the truck stop, but that doesn't mean it isn't just lurking somewhere nearby. The police DID search with a dog but the results were inconclusive.

I wasn't going to wait around to see if it came back.

I'm still not sure about that trucking company and what it was actually delivering. If that living corpse was anything to go by then I'm sure it was nefarious in nature.

If you see Rigg's truck stop, either avoid it or stay for only a short time. I won't be there to protect you and I probably wouldn't do a very good job either. Oh, and if you ever see Carrison Transports on the side of a semi? Stay far away from it.

Edit: So people are aware - the owner TOLD me the cameras didn't work. I found out once the police were able to acquire footage from them that it was a lie. The owner had apparently been dealing with theft so he had them installed but chose not to tell anyone they worked  (so he could catch the perpetrator in the act.)

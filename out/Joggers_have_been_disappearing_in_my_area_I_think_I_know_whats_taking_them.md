I was out on my five o’clock jog yesterday morning when something out of the corner of my eye caught my attention.

I’m not sure when I first noticed, but I gradually became aware that I was being followed.

There was another runner behind me, about thirty feet back, and they seemed to be keeping pace with me. I tried ignoring them at first, but I noticed after taking several turns that they were still on my tail. I have a very specific route, and it seemed unlikely to me that it could be a coincidence. Because it was the early morning, there was hardly anyone else around. Usually, I run about six miles, and after roughly three, I decided to have a peek over my shoulder.

The runner had gained on me, and was now only about twenty feet back. I was immediately caught off guard by their appearance. They looked to be male, although it was somewhat hard to tell at a distance. The guy was fully decked out in runner’s gear, with a crimson marathon jersey, skin-tight black shorts, and bright orange track shoes. Most notable however was the silver cap on his head, which reminded me of the kind swimmers usually wear for aerodynamics. His skin was white as a sheet, and he was running strangely, throwing his arms up with every step like the T-1000 from Terminator.

Most disconcerting of all, however, was the ear-to-ear grin on his face. 

I picked up my pace, hoping I could outrun him. My heart was beating more heavily than usual, and I felt sweat beads beginning to accumulate on my face. 

As hard as I tried, I couldn’t seem to lose him. All the sudden, two other figures entered my peripheral vision. They were running in tandem, approaching from a side street. They rounded the corner and appeared to fall in line behind the first runner, forming a sort of triangle with him in the lead. Once again, I snuck a glance back.

These two were garbed exactly like the first runner, with the same marathon jerseys and silver caps. One appeared to be male, the other, possibly female. They had the same pasty white skin, and the same wide smiles, like the kind you’d see in an insane asylum.

I was starting to feel a little freaked out, and worse, I was beginning to get tired. As fast as I tried to go, they still seemed to be gaining on me.

We passed another intersection, and out of nowhere, three more runners emerged. They fell in line behind the others, forming an even larger triangle, like a flock of geese. I noticed that they were all moving perfectly in tandem, throwing up their arms in unison with each step.

I decided to try and take evasive maneuvers. I hung a sharp right, onto a path that led around a small field. Here, many different trails branched off from one another, so I thought I would have the best chance of losing them.

Ahead of me, I spotted a family of four walking their dog. They were taking up most of the path, and I figured if I could put them between me and the runners it would at least stall them.

I skirted by the family, too exhausted by this point to say “on your left.”

I ran a little further, then glanced back. To my shock, the runners were still right on my tail. It was as if they had passed directly through the family, without even breaking ranks.

I neared a three-way intersection and started to go left. I almost froze in my tracks.

Coming towards me from this new path was another, identical group of runners. And I mean *identical—* they were wearing the same clothes, running the same exact way. At first, I thought the original group must’ve somehow headed me off, as implausible as that seemed, but when I threw a glance back they were still there, and getting even closer.

As this new group approached me, I took a hard right, onto a different path. Only, to my horror, I found a *third* group of runners approaching me from this direction. 

I was cornered, with the three groups rapidly converging on me from all sides. In a last act of desperation, I swerved. To the side of the path was a tall chain-link fence, which cordoned off a cluster of homes.

I scaled it, digging my hands into the chain link, and threw myself over the top. I landed hard on my ankle, and white-hot daggers of pain shot up my leg. I was in someone’s backyard, and a startled jack rustle terrier began howling at me from its doghouse. 

I was so exhausted by this point that I could barely breath. I forced myself to look back.

Through the chain-link, I saw that the three groups of runners had converged and were now standing perfectly still in the middle of the path. They stared at me; eerie smiles painted on their faces. However, none of them attempted to pursue me over the fence. It was as if they couldn’t leave the path.

They stood there silently for what seemed like hours. Then, slowly, I watched the group break apart. They all started jogging in different directions, individually this time. Only when they were all out of view did I begin to feel the slightest bit relaxed. 

I was still breathing heavily. An old woman suddenly appeared at the back door of the house and started screaming at me to get out of her yard.

I limped home, constantly looking over my shoulder, but I encountered none of the runners.

My ankle is well and truly sprained, so I won’t be going on more jogs anytime soon. Still, I wonder if I should warn people. I checked online, and there have been several disappearances in my area, all joggers.

What should I do?

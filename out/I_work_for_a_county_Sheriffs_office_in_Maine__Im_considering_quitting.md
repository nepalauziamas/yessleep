Autumn in Maine, the leaves turn from lush green to rustic orange and the late season hikers clear out. At the Sheriff’s office we prepare for the winter, which for the most part means stocking up for emergency management scenarios. We check all the generators, make sure our spare batteries are working and stock up on medical supplies. 

Ordinarily a sheriff’s office might only handle domestic issues, crimes and disturbances. However my station works closely with park rangers, so much so that I would almost consider my role a duel role. It’s part of my regular job to patrol the state park and help maintain the trails. This is in part because there are so few rangers, and because there is virtually no crime in the small county I work for. Occasional strange occurrences, sure. But actual crimes are very rare.

For me this meant that Sheriff Barrett saddled me with all the park work that needed to be done almost as soon as I got back from Oklahoma. I spent my days outside raking leaves, covering over pot holes, checking trail markers and watching my breath steam in the chilled air. Not that I minded, paper work wasn’t for me and I dared not disturb Diane’s delicate arrangement of files, lest she skin me alive.

A lot of the time I worked under the supervision of Allison Moore, who was the head park ranger. She was a plump lady, with salt and pepper grey hair styled in an afro. Being only 5’2” you would expect that she would be meek or shy, but she was quite unashamedly the opposite, when she addressed me I could hear it ring clear through the woods.

“Charles, it’s time for lunch! You need to get some meat on those bones!” She called with her hands on her hips as if she expected me to have known already. Maybe I should have. She kept me busy all day with endless tasks, but we usually took lunch together at the local diner and she always insisted on paying.

Over lunch she talked about her family, they were coming up for the holiday season and she wanted me to meet her daughter. I felt my ears turn red, she must’ve thought I needed help in the dating department and she was probably right, “You’re a handsome man, find yourself a wife!” She would always insist.

After lunch I headed back to the station. When I arrived I could hear the Sheriff carrying on. Someone was in trouble, “You two are going to be shovelling the snow off my drive for the next forty years of your lives if you vandalise Mrs Labelle’s gargoyle statue one more time. Do you hear me? You’re lucky I don’t-..”

I walked in to see two of our regular trouble makers sat awkwardly in front of his desk. The boys were in their early teens, harmless really, and they looked suitably traumatised. We had seen them in a couple times for other minor issues, but they weren’t bad kids, they just needed some direction. Barrett was probably scaring the life out of them with his eyebrows knitted into a cross of fury like they were.

Barrett cut off mid sentence when he spotted me, “Charles! Where have you been? Do you know what time it is?!”

He demanded and I scrambled for an answer, “I was having lunch with Mrs Moore, she kept me back to remove some branches from the trail.” I said quickly.

The younger of the two boys turned to look at me with wide eyes, “Aww no, please don’t tell Mimi I was here!” He exclaimed.

“Well, if you didn’t want her to find out, you shouldn’t have painted the gargoyle.” I answered with a ‘there’s nothing I can do to help you’ shrug. The boy’s name was Deion, and Mrs Moore was his grandmother.

“Have you seen the thing? It’s evil.” He grumbled sitting back down with his arms folded. I sympathised with him, the gargoyle that sat atop Mrs Labelle’s letter box *was* terrifying. Nonetheless, Barrett sentenced the boys to a week of picking up trash and general cleaning around the station while I slinked back to my desk, hoping my tardiness would be overlooked.

Unfortunately when he was done with the kids his attention returned to me. He didn’t approach my desk, rather he raised his voice to speak across the room at me, “Charles. We’ve been getting reports of some voodoo type stuff that someone’s set up in the woods. East trial. Go dismantle it. It’s a public eye sore and we can’t have people thinking we’ve got a cult in the area.” He instructed sitting back in his chair with his arms folded.

I raised an eyebrow, “Do you think it’s ahh.. You know…” I questioned cautiously, already hating myself for even suggesting it.

The Sheriff looked distinctly displeased, “What nonsense are you talking about boy? It’s just some kids messing around in the woods to scare tourists.” He said gruffly.

“Yeah, that’s probably right.” I agreed quickly, relieved, “Do you want me to get working on it now?”

“No Charles, I mentioned it so that you could take it into account and relax for the rest of the afternoon.” He spoke calmly, surprising me with his relaxed attitude. Then he spoke louder, “Of course I want you to go do it now! Take the ATV, and be quick about it.”

“Right, yes sir.” I said quickly hurrying to gather my things and go. I thought it was unlike him, I should have known.

“Wait up.. if it is ahh.. *Something*, you come right back. I’ll call the specialist.” Barrett added as I was heading out the door. The low concern in his voice was enough to make me nervous.

“Got it.” I assured, trying not to betray how unsettled that made me as I headed out. I had worked with the ’specialist’ twice before on cases that took an.. *Unconventional* path to resolution. Both times were at least mildly traumatising. I didn’t mind the man himself, but, the implication that this could be something that we weren’t normally equipped to handle was deeply disturbing.

“And keep your radio on!” I heard the Sheriff call after me.

I raised my hand to let him know I had heard as I made my way to the ATV’s. There were a few good hours of daylight left but I didn’t want to waste any time. Being out in the woods at night was not something I wanted to be doing and the specified trail was one of the longest. It headed east and up into the mountains and was the path adventurers took when they wanted to do a full day’s trip or an overnight stay.

This time of year it was quiet and making my way up the trail on the ATV was peaceful. Small birds darted between bare branches. The ground was damp, small puddles and mushy leaves lined the trail. We had already seen the first snow of the year, though it was little more than dirty slush, and that meant that in a few more weeks the ski season would begin. I wasn’t looking forward to that.

The cold wouldn’t be so bad, but it meant that before long overconfident people would be flooding the park infirmary with sprained ankles and broken arms. At the station last year we took turns helping out, this year however, I knew it would be all me. I allowed my thoughts to wander as my vehicle tires squelched on the muddy earth. For a time I thought a lot about how many injuries there would be and about how I would best get people off the mountain. Then my thoughts trailed off..

My sister would be coming around to stay with me soon. My parents live in the same town as myself, though I don’t see them as often as they would like, while my sister lives interstate. She never announces herself, but I knew that one day soon I would finish work to find her sitting on my doorstep with a suitcase, complaining about how long she had to wait in the cold for me to get home.

She’s somewhat of a free spirit. Shameless, with high energy and questionable decision making skills, but we get along well and I’m always secretly a little sad to see her go. More often than not she leaves the same way she arrives, spontaneously. Without a word of goodbye I’ll find a hastily scrawled note about how she’s headed out to wherever next and will see me again in ‘a while’. Honestly I don’t know how she manages to take care of herself. I was going to have to make sure to stock up the fridge on my way home though.

My thoughts were interrupted when I came across two hikers, I recognised them as locals and they greeted me with familiarity. I could tell by the look on their faces that they were deeply concerned about something and they went on to explain that they had come across some occult ritual in the woods. If I’m honest, they looked quite shaken. I should have known that their inability to accurately describe what they had seen meant it was something bad.

I realised quickly that they had been the ones to call in about the ‘voodoo’ in the woods. Apparently it was in a clearing not too far ahead to the right. They had stayed to help guide me to the location, though they were quite anxious to leave the area. I’ll admit this made me feel a little unsettled, they weren’t the kind of people to spook easily which was an ominous sign.

Strange things have happened in these woods. People have gone missing under mysterious circumstances, reports of strange animal sightings are common, and of course, there was the May incident that I had personally witnessed. I felt a swell of anxiety in my gut remembering it, most of the time I put it to the back of my mind.

In general I try not to think about the things I can’t well explain. I have, unfortunately, seen more unexplainable things than I would like to admit. However, I had never experienced them alone. Each time something unnatural happened, Eric Linnaeus had been there to resolve the issue. He was the specialist Barrett mentioned and I found myself regretting that he hadn’t been called right away as I came across the clearing in question.

I found it easily as the nearby trees had been stripped of all low hanging branches. Cautiously I pulled into the clearing and from a distances I could see that the grasses in the area were crushed down in an anticlockwise direction creating a perfectly circular space among the trees.

In the centre of this clearing was the still smouldering remains of a fire of some kind. Smoke rose from it slowly in wispy plumes. However, even as I approached, the forest showed no signs of danger. In the trees the birds still sang carelessly and insects still chirped. I couldn’t tell if this was a good sign or not, all the hair on the back of my neck was standing on end. The wildlife might not sense any danger, but I certainly did.

Taking a deep breath in I tried to calm my nerves. There was nothing there, no one was around. It was just a space in which someone *had* once been, and they were no longer there I told myself. I entered the area with hesitance and approached the coals. Now that I was closer I could see fragments of bone in the ashes, I’m not an expert in anthropology, but the remains didn’t look to be human to me. Perhaps though, it was a deer?

I began to convince myself that this was just some illegal hunters idea of a spooky joke. Maybe even left over Halloween decoration of some kind. I ignored the fact that there was no litter whatsoever in the area and I pretended I didn’t notice the odd way in which everything was directed anticlockwise.

As I looked around I noticed that there were small charms hanging in the trees. They were made of sticks and twine with small bones woven into each arrangement. I grimaced to myself, this was undoubtedly what the Sheriff wanted me to take down. I knew he would want me to make the area look ‘normal’ again.

I set about my task reluctantly, taking each unusual object down and loading them into a garbage bag. I was relieved to find that they seemed to be made of plastic and common thread. They were props like those you by in Halloween stores and this made me feel immensely better.

Of corse I still wasn’t sure what I should do with these things once they were taken down. Obviously I didn’t want to take them back with me, but I also didn’t know what else I was supposed to do with them. Bury them maybe? Probably not, it wouldn’t look good for an officer to litter, I reprimanded myself. Though it didn’t really matter for when I touched the 4th one it pricked me.

Surprised I stared at it dumbfounded, I hadn’t realised it had thorns, the others didn’t. Blood ran freely down my hand and arm, it wasn’t a lot, but enough to stain my sleeve. I cursed myself for not being more careful and looked over the object more thoroughly.

This one was indeed different from the others. It was made with real wood, blackened with a vine of thorns tangled into the design. In place of twine was what looked like human hair and the bones in it weren’t made of plastic, instead they seemed avian with dried flesh that still clung to them. I recoiled dropping the thing.

I couldn’t imagine what kind of person would make something like it and I decided right then that this was more than kids messing around, this thing, was *real*. The atmosphere around me changed then, the forest fell silent and I felt nausea wash over me. My vision blurred and before I knew it I was stumbling back to the ATV. I tried to call over the radio for help, but I couldn’t get through.

My fingers slipped off the buttons as I tried to press them in and I struggled to form coherent sentences as I tried to explain what had happened. I received no response. When I reached my vehicle I tried to grab a hold of the handle bars, but they were doubled and I missed repeatedly. It was frustrating. I could see the thing sitting there unmoving, yet I couldn’t get a hold of it. Thinking back, even if I had, I probably wouldn’t have been able to drive it.

I realised that the charm must have been poisoned, a trap for anyone who tried to touch it and I was that unfortunate person. I’m not sure when or how I fell over. Gravity seemed to shift and I fell sideways to the ground. It didn’t hurt, but I couldn’t get up. I flailed helplessly on the ground, the dampness sinking into my clothes so that before long I was shivering as well.

That’s when I first noticed it.. It was a blackened figure with tattered clothing crawling along the ground toward me. It came from the direction of the clearing and I could see it coming for me through the gap under the ATV. It’s dark shape contrasted unnaturally against the earthy tones of the forest and it seemed horrifically out of place in the daylight.

I struggled more then, trying to get up, or at least to just get away but it was useless. Every effort I made was uncoordinated. My limbs wouldn’t move in any useful way and I fell back to the ground again. In desperation I tried to unholster my gun but I couldn’t get the latch to undo, or maybe it was just that I couldn’t remember how to do it. Regardless, I was painfully helpless. I could feel the blood rushing in my ears and adrenaline pumping through me, I felt like I was having a heart attack. I couldn’t breathe.

There’s nothing I can say that will describe the terror I felt. My flight or fight response was trying to work but my body was uncooperative, I can’t even say that I was frozen with fear. It was more just that I had no control over anything. The creature was by then upon me. It crawled up the length of my body, it’s nails dug into my skin as it dragged itself up to be eye level with me. I realised then that it looked like a burned woman. She had no eyes and her teeth hung loose from her jaw as she opened her mouth wide over me. A sticky black fluid poured from her mouth over my face, it felt like drowning all over again and I got flashbacks of the Oklahoma incident.

I don’t know when I passed out, however when I came too it was dusk and I was alone. The radio on my shoulder crackled to life and Diane’s voice came through loud and clear, ‘Charles, calling Charles. Can you hear me?’ She asked, her tone caught between annoyance and concern as if she had been trying to contact me for a while.

‘I’m here.’ I answered with a groan, my entire body ached. I felt as though I had been hit by a truck and lived, barely.

‘Where have you been? Why didn’t you answer sooner!?’ She demanded now, any concern she may have had evaporating.

It took me a moment to recollect what had happened and I sat up fast, a little too fast, causing my head to spin as I remembered the burned woman. Looking around I couldn’t see her, nor any sign that she had been there. There was no trace of black fluid and no footprints in the mud other than my own.

For a time I thought I must’ve hallucinated the entire thing. Feeling foolish I didn’t want to tell Diane that I had been passed out on the forest floor for however long, so I lied, ‘Sorry, I was cleaning up the clearing. I didn’t hear the radio.’

‘Not good enough Charles.’ She scolded but the relief in her voice was obvious, ‘Are you headed back in now? It’s almost dark, Sheriff isn’t happy.’

‘Yeah, I’m on my way back now.’ I assured. I knew as well as she did that being on the trail at night was a situation to be avoided if at all possible.

‘Good.’ Diane said in a final tone as I clambered back onto the ATV.

The way back took some time and it was well and truely dark by the time I arrived. Barrett was, as promised, not very happy with me, “What did you do? Roll in the mud? Don’t stand on the carpets, they were just cleaned.” He said gruffly looking me up and down.

I knew I was a mess, dried mud was stuck to my uniform and hair, though at least most of the leaves had blown off me on the way back, “Yes Sheriff.” I agreed easily but I must have sounded more pitiful than I intended because his tone softened.

“Take the day off tomorrow, looks like you’ve had a rough day.” He instructed.

“No, I’m fine, I can work tomorrow.” I insisted, I knew he wasn’t trying to punish me, but it felt like he was.

“I won’t hear a word about it, if you come in tomorrow you’re fired. Take the day to recover.” He reiterated and I realised arguing further was going to be pointless.

If I’m honest I did feel, off.. Not sick, just exhausted and sore, all my joints hurt. I sanitised my mouth particularly well that night, and scrubbed my face near raw. By the time I got out of the shower I felt somewhat better, but I wasn’t sure that what I experienced really happened.

Where the charm had pricked me I had a small red mark on my hand, but otherwise I was physically unharmed. Psychologically though, maybe I was a tad more shaken than I’m willing to admit.

By the end of it all I was more or less just waiting for something *else* to happen. I wanted to call Eric, but I also didn’t want to waste his time. What could I even say? I *think* something supernatural happened to me, ‘please help’? I decided against it. He probably wouldn’t even answer anyway.

I think the charm was laced with hallucinogens, someones idea of a joke I’m sure. Just make sure you’re careful if you go out into the woods. I don’t know if there are more, but I hope there aren’t.

My name is Danny, I live in LA and I am 24 years old. I guess I should start from the beginning, I was talking to my friend “Fizzy” on Discord at around 12:30 am. We were talking about our favorite youtubers and the recent video they’ve been uploading. That’s when I got a friend request by a user called “Sophia47”. I was skeptical to accept at first, but I remembered that I told my friend from school “Harry” to add me on Discord earlier today. I looked at the profile picture and it was a middle-aged woman wearing glasses smiling, but something looked off.

The background was messy, and I don’t mean that as in it was dirty, it was a beige wall that was really tortuous and 1 plant that was abnormally… twisted. Harry was always joking around at school so I just assumed that this was him messing around, I can’t believe I actually accepted it without messaging him on WhatsApp first. As soon as I accepted the friend request, they went offline, then online again. Over and over until I sent my first message to them. I typed “Yo!” but I got no response, I sent another message “You there?” and again, no reply.

I was starting to think that I got sent this request by accident, so I quickly asked Harry on WhatsApp if he sent the request or not. “Is he even awake right now?” I whispered to myself. Then, I got a notification on Discord. It was Fizzy, I sort of left him hanging when I Sophia sent me their request. I got into a call with Fizzy and we started watching YouTube together, it was fun. Halfway through one of the many videos we watched, Sophia finally messaged me for the first time. She sent me a video called “10 habits of mine.mp4”.

I told Fizzy about it and he said to just “leave them on read, for now.” And so, I did just that. I also muted them because they kept sending stuff then deleting it just to get my attention. After we got bored of YouTube, Fizzy wanted to play a game with me. So, we ended up choosing “Stick Fight” It was a fun time! But unfortunately, he had to go because it was almost 1:45 am now. I opened Discord to see what new things I’d missed.

Apparently, Sophia tried video calling me and had sent me lots and lots of mp3 titles. They were all called “Habit 1” “Habit 2” etc. I scrolled up and played the first video she sent called “10 habits of mine.mp4” I should note that the video was 2 minutes and 50 seconds, why am I telling you this? You’ll see later. The video starts of with a guy in a dark room tied to a chair. He... apologizes and says he’s “sorry”. Then he said something so completely insane, it took me a while to comprehend it.

He said “You have been talking with someone else. For the past couple of days, you’ve been playing with someone who I can only call “000”. Not Fizzy. The voice messages you received are all useless. They are just blank audio files. As for this video, as soon you start it you will have 2 minutes and 50 seconds until 000 himself, sends you a friend request.” Sophia47”, is not real. But you probably guessed that already. And where is Fizzy, you might be asking? We unfriended you from his account.” As he said whilst laughing manically.

The video ended. So much information, in such little time. I instantly got a friend request from a bald guy with the yellowest teeth I’ve ever seen using a Snapchat filter. I didn’t accept this time, I blocked him right away. It was now 2:10 am. I was so sleepy; I was starting to think everything that just happened was a dream. I fell asleep accidently on my sofa. I woke up the next morning and checked Discord, the real Fizzy was on my friends list again. Sophia and 000 both disappeared from my recent messages, like they never even existed.

I took a massive sigh of relief, as I told Fizzy all about my dream. But, then I got a text message from Harry, he said “Nope not yet, Will send one today tho Alrighty?”. Wait… So did everything actually happen, or did I send that message to Harry in my sleep?

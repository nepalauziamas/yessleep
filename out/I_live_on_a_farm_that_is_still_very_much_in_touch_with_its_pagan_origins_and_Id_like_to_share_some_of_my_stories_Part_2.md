Many people have expressed an interest in the other stories I have to tell, so here is a story about the Footprint, and my Uncle Peter's disappearance. 

You can find the first part of my story here: https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/x4cdzt/i_live_on_a_farm_that_is_still_very_much_in_tune/ 


To recap: There has been a farm of some kind on this land for centuries. Our farm was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 and doubtless our family history goes back even further. It has changed a lot, of course, with the buildings being extended and rebuilt and destroyed and rebuilt again, but there are parts still recognisable from its different eras: A crumbling wall; the remnants of a well, boarded over for safety; the scars of a fire on the land around the barn.


The land is not normal now, and as far as I know never has been, but it was always fairly successful and thrived even during hard times, right up until my Uncle Pete disappeared. His disappearance had heralded something of a depression on the land, and when my grandparents died and my father took over the running of the farm he found it difficult to keep his head above water. 


It suffered the biggest blow back in 2001 when the foot and mouth outbreak swept across the UK and decimated our cattle. They hadn't become infected, but there had been an outbreak close by and according to regulations our cows were culled and burned to halt the spread. It had broken my father, and he's never quite been the same since. Neither has the farm. 


Recessions shook him hard too, and he'd sold off parcels of land as and when needed to neighbouring farms, although there weren't many people willing to purchase our land. Country people can be superstitious and our farm was locally infamous. Many of our fields stood empty and unused, and it was a habit of my father's to roam them as if he were taking a pilgrimage. 


But I did ask him about Uncle Pete after I posted the other day. He's told me the story many times over the years, but a little bit more gets added every time he tells it, so I will tell you the most recent version.


I went downstairs to ask him. It had been raining and there was mud on my father's boots.


I saw them in the hallway as I came downstairs, tossed onto a sheet of newspaper under the hanging coats. 

It wasn't the everyday kind of mud that would have been splashed up from the paths around the house, but a rich, dark sludge that mired them up to the laces. I knew what it meant: It meant my father had been to the north fields again and that was never a good sign.


By instinct I glanced at the stained glass window that overlooked the bend in the stairs. On sunny days it bathed the hallway in a ruddy glow, but on a day like this the colours were dull and flat. The solitary figure that stood in the fields was proportionally too large and its face was blurred by rain from the other side of the pane. There was no help to be found in the window today, but the glass landscape was bleak. 


My father drank when he went to the north fields. Sometimes drinking drove him up there and sometimes being there drove him to drink. I had been sent to retrieve him more than once, and it was an errand I hated. He seemed lost up there, a mere speck against the sprawl, shrinking smaller with every visit. One day, I thought, he might disappear altogether. Like Pete had done.


I remained on the stairs, half way up, half way down. I could hear the tv in the living room, and over that the minute clink of glass on wood.


I turned to go back up, not eager to confront my father after he'd been to the fields, and the traitor stair creaked beneath me. 


"Who's there?"


My father's voice, not slurred yet but sharp and wary. It was a question asked often in this house. We could never be sure if a creak was made by the living. 


"It's only me," I called, grinding the ball of her foot into the stair's tread to punish it for its tattling.


"Oh."


Relieved.


"Are you coming down or what? Stop loitering."


Resigned, I turned back again and completed my descent, side-stepping the puddles my father's dripping coat had left on the floor.


He was sat on the threadbare sofa, one foot up on the coffee table. There was a hole in his sock and his big toe peeped through. He looked as worn out as the sofa, and the sock


There was a beer bottle next to the propped up foot, and I felt a small measure of reassurance from that: On bad days it was rough cider; on worse ones, spirits. Beer wasn't so bad.


He  smiled at me. The tv reflected off his glasses, winking fleeting flashes of moving light at her, so I was unable to see his eyes, and it reminded me for a fleeting second of the day I had traced the pattern on the stones. 


It may seem strange to some that I had to test this person sitting there, that I was uncertain as to what it might be, but it was a common problem in our house. I will talk of some of these instances later, but for now I will tell you I asked the kind of question we always asked. 


"Who would win in a fight? A hundred horses the size of chickens against one horse sized chicken?" 


My father laughed. 


"It's alright, babs. It's me. And to answer your question, I think one normal sized chicken would win against a hundred horse sized horses. You know what bastards they can be." 


I relaxed. Asking questions that relied on memories was never any good against a mimic in the house, as they could pluck memories from us, but illogical questions would always stump them. 


"Where's mum?" I asked. 


He sighed. 


"You know what day it is. She's putting flowers by the Old Paddock." 


Made sense. My mother's calendar wasn't like other family's. There weren't just birthdays and wedding anniversaries and appointments on hers, but a careful recap of every incident of note that had occurred on the land, which she copied over to a new calendar every year. She had married into the family, but as a superstitious woman treated the land and family as her own and observed every ritual she thought she needed to observe in order to keep further bad luck at bay.


I told my father then about what I'd posted on Reddit, and the interest it has accrued, and he looked both proud and embarrassed. He couldn't fathom that people could want to know about our little corner of England, but he has always loved to tell his stories, so I have permission to share this. 


As far as the Footprint is concerned, we do not know what it is or how it happened but we have a fair idea as to what it does.


Throughout most of my ancestry the Footprint has been left alone, but in later years  - the years of my father and his brother - there was some experimentation, despite knowing what dangers it might hold. The field it is on has been called the Old Paddock for years, despite the fact that no horses have ever successfully been kept in it. 


My uncle tried, before I was born, to keep horses there. It was a spectacular failure. Two horses were let into the enclosed field surrounding the Footprint and within minutes one horse broke its legs in an attempt to shatter the fence keeping it in. The other had leapt over the fence the first horse had tried to break, and gone galloping into the fields beyond never to be seen again. 


My uncle tried cows next: They were reluctant to enter the confined space but had done so after much urging, and thereafter had crowded into the far corner so urgently that they had been extracted amongst fears that the smaller cows would be trampled to death in an attempt to escape the influence of the Footprint.


The only marginal success had been some sheep, borrowed from a fellow farmer just for the experiment, although my father had been against it. 


They had entered the fenced field without qualms and whilst they had avoided the Footprint hadn't seemed to pay it much mind otherwise.


My father told me of the aftermath. When he had been drinking, my father was all too willing to discuss those matters others would not discuss.


"My brother - your Uncle Joe - was determined to put that field to use," he told me, once upon a time. "Horses didn't work. Cows didn't work. The sheep were better. Sheep are stupid. At least, that's what we thought till we got up the next morning. Three of them. Dead. Just like that. I ain't gonna tell you what we found but it warn't nice. My own father tried to say it was a dog on the loose had got into the pen, but we all knew no dog would ever get that close to the Footprint. No dog ever has. And those sheep… Ah, Chloe. Never seen anything like it. They was in pieces. We got the rest of the sheep out that day and never spoke about it again. "


I never asked for details. Everyone knew the Old Paddock was out of bounds and anyone who got close to the Footprint could feel the influence it had. Just being close would give you the sensation of brushing past nettles, a prickle on the skin that would lift each hair you had on your body and if you got closer you felt like nothing you had ever done mattered in the universe. It was a sensation of insignificance that you wouldn't shake till you had left the proximity of the Footprint and turned your mind to mortal matters. But people had been lost to it, directly or indirectly.


One of the first laws of physics I ever learned was that of cause and effect, as the stones had taught me. The Footprint had been a lesson for my father, when my Uncle Pete had disappeared. 


My father was the youngest of three brothers. He was the baby of the family, and was treated as such for a long time. My grandmother always described him as an "Oops!" baby. There was an 8 year gap between him and Uncle Joe, a 10 year gap between him and Uncle Pete. 


Uncle Pete had been my father's hero. From what he told me, he'd been a good brother, not prone to the bullying that might have been expected. He looked after my brother and all the little cousins who swarmed around the farm periodically. 


My father's best friend in his childhood had been a cousin, a partner in crime and fellow rascal called Lydia, and together they had been unstoppable. The only authority they would listen to had been Uncle Pete. 


Uncle Pete had disappeared on my grandmother's birthday. My father had been 6 years old. The entire family had congregated at the farm - cousins and in-law's and everyone in between - to celebrate. Everyone had eaten a great deal, and the adults had indulged in a lot of home brewed beer and cider, so after dinner the children had been sent out to play in the fields with the usual cautions. 


Pete, as the oldest at 16, had led the little party of children. My father told me he and Lydia had stayed close to Pete and close to each other, whispering and giggling and plotting mischief. There was mischief to be had, but the general feeling was that they would all rather be in the house, listening to the stories the adults told when they'd had too much to drink. 


Pete had sensed the restlessness of the little group, and had started to talk about the Footprint. It was a subject all the kids were fascinated and terrified by. 


"How many of you have seen the 'print?" he'd asked, and there had been an answering murmur, subdued yet excited at the same time. 


My father had hung back, clutching onto Lydia's hand as the older kids went on ahead. 


Pete had gone on to tell his enthralled audience about the devil and his fight with God, and how he'd placed his hoof on the earth during the fight and left his mark eternally.


He then said he wasn't scared of it. 


My father, looking back, always said it was bravado. Pete knew all the little ones looked up to him and he wanted to impress them. So it made sense that he would lead the children up to the Old Paddock. 


There was a fence around the Footprint, as there always has been from the start, and Pete sat on that fence with his legs dangling into the paddock, kicking his feet against the old wooden slats and stirring up little puffs of dust. 


Whilst the little kids crowded up next to him, he had pulled a smooth, rounded pebble from his pocket, turned it over in his hand.


"I don't believe in the devil," he had said. "And I don't reckon he left his print here. If he is real, he would stop me…" 


My father said he'd gasped as Pete pulled his hand back over his shoulder and launched the pebble towards the Footprint. 


Everyone had expected something to happen: a burst of light or a flame or some kind of resistance, but the little pebble had sailed across the withered grass and landed right in the centre of the scorched circle with no impediment, or any reaction. 


Pete had turned then, regarding his numerous little charges, and had smirked. 


"No devil here," he said. "No such thing. Let's go back to the house. I reckon they'll be serving the ice cream. " 


They had started to make their way back. The excitement of seeing Pete metaphorically spitting in the devil's face with no consequences, and the prospect of ice cream, had made many of the children exuberant, but my father and Lydia had trailed behind. My father had always been a sensitive child, my grandmother once told me, to the embarrassment of my father, and he had known something bad would come to pass. 


"I had a bad feeling," he would tell me, half a century later. "The worst feeling. It's the feeling you get when you know you've done something wrong and you're waiting for someone to find out and punish you. Only this time I knew it wouldn't be a beating or a scolding. It was gonna be worse." 


They were nearly back to the farmhouse when Uncle Pete had peeled away from the group to answer the call of nature. He'd winked at my father as he strolled towards a handy bush, already unzipping his jeans. 


"Gotta water the flowers," he'd said, and Lydia had giggled. 


The bush had been small, not even tall enough to hide Pete's upper body even as it covered him from the waist down, and they'd watched him smile and sigh as he began to piss. He'd been caught in simple bliss then, a basic need being taken care of, and when his face changed to one of confusion and dismay they couldn't imagine what had happened. 


"He dint just disappear," my father said. "Dint blink out of existence. We saw him frown, then saw him look scared, and then he just dropped. Like he'd fallen down a hole all of a sudden. Me and Lydia ran over to see if he was okay, but when we got round the other side of the bush, there was nothing. No hole, no Pete. No piss, even. Just dead grass and a blank space."


They had all searched, despite the eyewitness account. Little kids calling and crying and rummaging in every bush trying to find Pete. Uncle Joe had been the one to finally run back to the house and tell the adults what had happened. 


"We all got packed off to bed," my father told me. "My parents were white as milk and my aunts and uncles were crying, but they still tucked us all in, boys in one room, girls in another, and told us to stay put. We heard them for hours, calling for Pete, whacking bushes. Then later, way, way, later, we heard them all wailing in the house. I was used to the adults being noisy after us kids had gone to bed, but it was usually singing and laughing and telling stupid stories, but not that night. They knew he'd gone. We all knew he'd gone… "


Uncle Pete had disappeared without a trace that day, but not forever. He'd come back. But that day had been just as horrifying as the day he'd disappeared. 


This has taken a long time to write and the rest of this tale is also long, so if you want to hear about that day too, let me know :)

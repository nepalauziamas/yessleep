It was a normal day and I was watching TV in the living room with my parents, it was about 9:30 and I had just gotten back from work, well.. I say "work" I mean I helped my dad install a new shower filter. So getting back from his house to mine, I saw my parents were there and I don't remember inviting them over.

"Hey guys, did James invite you over?" I asked them.
James was my roommate from kindergarten and we got along pretty well, so I guess he thought that I wouldn't mind if he invited my family over for a big dinner.

"Yes actually! He said we could have a big dinner with everybody." My mom said. I gave James a look indicating that he needs my permission before acting.
He knows that face very well and he accepted it.

So, I sat down and watched TV.

Just then, I got a notification from WhatsApp saying that my grandfather texted me.

I looked at it and it said
"Hey! I built a new house at the village, wanna come over for a big dinner?"

I asked my family," Guys! We could have a big dinner over at my grandfather's new house!" I suggested.

Everyone agreed.

As if they NEEDED me to go there immediately.
I shrugged it off and set off to granddad's house.

I arrived and stared at the house in awe.It looked so modern for a village that was built a century ago.

I entered to see there was boxed up furniture everywhere and other crates aside with the corners.
It was only one story so you could see most of the house from the doorstep.

What seemed like days at his house passed and it was already 1am. I needed to get up early at 6 since I had a dentist appointment and 10am in the morning, becuase my grandfather's house was 300 kilometres away from the dentist, so I would need to drive for 4 hours straight to get there on time.

Anyway, getting to bed, I heard a screech from the barn that was across the house and saw a cow lying on the floor looking almost dead, it was terrifying, maggots were feeding on its carcass as it let out it's last breaths for a scream.

I felt bad for it. But as soon as the cow howled, I heard a glass shatter downstairs. It startled me for some reason. I had heard it all my life and it gave me chills today.

My gut feeling was to politely leave the house back to my house and spend the rest there, but that would be rude, wouldn't it?

Yet again, I shrugged it off and got to bed.
Immediately woke up at 2am and heard yet again, another howl that sounded identical to the first.
So, I went to investigate the barn.

I grabbed the typical equipment for investigating.
A flashlight and a defense weapon.

I tiptoed out of the house and entered the barn.
All the animals were asleep and it smelled like a normal barn, except the smell of gasoline.

It came from the corner of the place, where there was a haystack and a weed whacker, I walked over and saw a blacked out creature, almost like a black hole which had legs. I had a sensation where it wanted to pull you in its insides.

I ran as soon as I saw it.
But it was too late.
It was already chasing me and it's claws digging into my flesh.

It was too painful to explain. 
I screamed in horror as it screamed as loud as it can into my ear.

I opened my eyes.

I was in my house.

Sleeping peacefully and waking up to my alarm.

I never had a dentist appointment.

I felt like I did though.

I told myself
"Always follow your gut feeling".

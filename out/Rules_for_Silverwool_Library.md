I was desperate for a job. Unfortunately there weren't many openings in my town and the ones that did required experience and being in college I had none. So I was glad when I finally got accepted at a local library. I instantly accepted the job, it had a good pay of $6 an hour and I worked from 11pm to 4 am.

The drive to the library took about 45 minutes. It was at the outskirts of the town surrounded mostly by trees. The closest building to it was 20 minutes away. The email stated that I could find the necessary guidelines and rules to be followed at my desk on the first floor.

The desk was close to the entrance so that you could see anyone who walked in and out. The library was deserted when I arrived. I skimmed through the guidelines and paperwork which was mostly general rules. What caught my eye was a golden paper labelled 

'WELCOME TO SILVERWOOL LIBRARY'

We're pleased to welcome and have you as a member of our Team. These are a few guidelines to keep in mind. Please know that failure to comply these rules may result in serious consequences, and at a best case scenario would be termination. Read the rules thoroughly and memorise them.

1. Upon starting your shift here, please dedicate the first 15 mins in thoroughly rounding the library and ensuring no human is inside. If you do find any humans, please escort them outside immediately.

2. All of our customers human or not should be treated with the utmost respect. This includes refraining from making certain comments about their appearance.

3. At 11:15 p.m sharp, you may find the lights starting to flicker and will dim. Please do not worry  and leave it be as most our patrons do not respond well to bright light.

4. You may encounter a patron with green wobbly skin, Mr. Demarcus. If he asks for assistance, help him but do not engage in any other conversation with him.

5. Your desk is the safest place in the library. Unless for assisting customers or conducting rounds, do not attempt to leave it for prolonged periods of time.

6. We pride ourselves in greatly accommodating our patrons of all kinds. However, creatures with black horns are not allowed inside the library. We require that our staff sprinkle holy water at the entrance of the library at the beginning of every shift to keep them out. This is for their own safety. 

7. Starting at midnight until 1 a.m. you may see a tall, black figure between the bookcases. Try not to pay much attention to him. He may use tactics and change voices or start screaming (please cover your ear while he screams or else they might bleed). Remember he cannot hurt you as long as you do not pay attention to him, this includes looking for prolonged periods.

8. At times, you'll hear loud laughter around the library even if it's empty. Remind them to keep it down at all times.

9. Between 12:45 to 12:49, you may hear the telephone start to ring. Please DO NOT pick up that phone. No one is calling you during that time.

10. If the telephone starts to ring and a Miss Delaphany asks you to spare her some blood, kindly decline her request and say 'It is not apart of my job'. She will call multiple times throught your shift.

11. Sometime around 2 a.m. you'll encounter a creature with abnormally long legs and no face. Before he reaches your desk, you must tell him 'No Eres Bienvenido'. If he already reaches your desk, we are sorry but there is nothing we can do. 

12. While walking around the library, you may hear footsteps following you. Do not be alarmed and pretend to not hear it.  You need to walk around the 'Literature and Art Bookshelfs' 3 times and the footsteps will stop. During this time, DO NOT LOOK BACK.

13. If you see a janitor mopping this place, IMMEDIATELY exit the library. We do not have any janitors.

14. *If you do break these rules, immediately run to  the nearest study room and hide. After 5 mins, you may hear the sound of a train engine, it is safe to leave. However if you instead hear a whistle, they are already here. Remain hidden, close your eyes and Pray.

*This excludes rule 11 as there is no chance of survival.

We hope you stay apart of your family here at Silverwool Library. Paychecks will be sent every Saturday.

Silverwool Library is not liable for any injuries sustained - physical or mental.

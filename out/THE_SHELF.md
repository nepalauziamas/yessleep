Chapter 1

As Above So Below

A young boy played, rummaging through the backyard junk of a dilapidated home in a deserted town on a deserted continent. He picked up a dirty old globe earth, the kind you’d see back when there were classrooms, and excitedly ran with his find down a dusty path to the homestead. 

He lived with his Grandpa Jack on a micro farm in coastal Uruguay on a beach with chickens, a couple of goats, vegetable patches and fruit trees.

The old man sat on a wooden bench and stared at the beautiful sky blue water. The boy excitedly jumped onto the squeaky porch to show his Grandpa the dirty scratched up globe earth he found, like it was an ancient lost treasure. “Grandpa, Grandpa look what I found, look what I found!” The boy set it down on a rickety wooden table and the pair let out a big laugh. “Go get your fishing pole and catch us something for lunch.” The boy ran off, came back with pole, and leaned it up against the railing. He looked at the blue water, the blue sky, the water and sky again. Scratching his head he asked, “Grandpa, why is the sky and the water the same color blue?”

A smile slowly grew on the deeply wrinkled face, “Son, it’s the way water and the sky soak up the sunlight like a sponge. All the bays, lakes, oceans and skies are blue during the day, but without the sunlight are black. “Like at night time, Grandpa?” The old man nodded. “Grandpa, does that mean there is water in the sky?!”  

“Exactly correct my boy, now, go catch us a fish. And check the crab pots too.”

Chapter 2

Crossing Bransfield Strait

Because the Antarctic continent was closed to full and independent exploration by the general public, Jack and a small crew made their way from Uruguay to Deception Island by sail boat. They anchored, rested and prepped for the Antarctic Wall. 

Jack and his small crew of men sailed from Uruguay to Deception Island anchored their boat and prepared for crossing the Bransfield Strait to the Antarctic Wall.

The men in Zodiacs ducked as they tore across the choppy waters. Machine gun fire from a low flying helicopter cut a pattern around them to try and scare them off. As the outboard motor hummed, a loud speaker blared from the helicopter, “You are in restricted waters!” The men looked up with their sea sprayed faces as they reached the Antarctic Wall. They scaled it quickly with ice climbing gear. But at the top they were immediately surrounded by U.N. troops. The men were shot with tranquilizing darts and transported to the Ice Prison.

CHAPTER 3

ICE PRISON PTSD

The grandfather woke, rubbed his eyes and looked out toward the end of the rocky jetty where the boy checked the crab pots.

His eyes drifted across the sky blue water as tinnitus whistled. He remembered the loud speakers that blared from the helicopter and felt the sharp pain of the dart like it was yesterday.

Closing his eyes tightly he could still feel how cold it was on the frozen ground of the prison yard, thrown against the fence among hundreds of men. Only the breath like steamy thermals distinguished the living from the dead.

Awakened by gleeful excitement: “Grandpa, Grandpa, look at all the big crabs I caught!”

“ That’s great son, now go check the fishing pole.” 

Teary eyes squinted across the water remembering how the prison guards stood out in bright orange suits weaving in and amongst us, jabbing the ones who were still alive with hypodermic needles and carting off the dead on sleds. The needle sticks reawaken his childhood terror —getting all the

those vaccines while being held down by 3 nurses plus his mother. 

The guards were taking the dead through an opening in the fence where there was a large truck with with massive snow tires and a big cage on the back. They loaded in the bodies and slammed the cage door. An older man pointed a boney crooked finger as his last plume of breath escaped him. Frozen solid as a statue, he was pointing to something. Trying with all his remaining energy to focus, Jack shockingly saw two very, very large polar bears running up to the truck sniffing and pawing violently at the dead bodies stacked inside the cage. The bears jumped on top, turning around and around in circles & gnashing their teeth and paws against the metal. Jack wondered if he was hallucinating because there are no polar bears in Antarctica. The bears settled down on top of the cage. It seemed like they had done this before. The truck took off with the bears riding on the cage like two kids in the back of an El Camino. 

Then all of a sudden the guards in the yard dropped everything and ran toward their helicopters. It seemed they were scared by something.

Chapter 4 

YouTube

Someone uploaded drone video of the Ice Prison which quickly went viral leading to a full on invasion of thousands of civilians in countless small boats and two seater planes crossing the Drake Strait, breaching the Antarctic Wall, and liberating what was left of us.

This caused panic at the United Nations, which called an emergency meeting. It was decided they would instruct all major media to describe the incident as Fake News. When that didn’t work, all social media platforms were instructed to take down any Ice Prison videos but of course it was too late. 

In the USA there was pandemonium at the White House. A hasty press conference was called and the floundering press secretary tried to sell the Fake News with every spin possible but no reporter was buying, not even CNN. The press secretary crab- walked away from the podium, slipping through the side door. Members of the press shouted, clamoring for the president to come out and make a statement.  It was decided he would give a live address from the East Room. The frazzled president walked up to the podium. The press was glued to the monitors in the briefing room.

The president opened his mouth and stammered. He barely got out a few unintelligible words before the feed cut off. 

Chapter 5

Temporary End

After the liberation of the Ice Prison Jack decided to head in the opposite direction everybody else was going. He got a lift back to a beach in Uruguay which had a wonderful view of of the Atlantic Ocean where the fishing and crabbing were excellent. Along with a perfect climate for growing food. It was calm place to homestead and heal.

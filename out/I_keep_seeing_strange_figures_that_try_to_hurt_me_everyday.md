As a kid I was home alone, getting ready for school. My mom made us all take off our shoes before we enter the house and leave them in front of the door, so we did. As I opened the front door slightly to grab my shoes quickly, I saw the door out of the building open and a weird figure running down the stairs aiming exactly at MY door.
I don’t know what it was, I just left the shoes there and didn’t go to school that day, but since that happened, I’ve been seeing creatures who are hiding in the dark corners everywhere.
In elementary it was worse than now, as I was on a class trip once, I saw these things hiding in the bushes, behind trees in forests that have no entry, I saw them everywhere.
One day as I walked back from school, (my elementary was behind a forest)
I felt as something was staring at me the whole time, as I turned around, next to a big tree, there it was. It was tall, maybe 6’9-7’0, it had long arms ans legs and long fingers. One hand was attached to the tree, cutting something into it, the other one was waving at me. It’s eyes were black and they were fixed at me. 
I screamed at ran across the street and hid behind a building, some random parent came to me with their kid and asked me if I’m okay, when I wanted to show them the thing, it was gone.

I had a few years free of them, I even forgot they existed, even though I always felt watched as I slept I brushed it off and thought it was my cat hi  der being a weirdo.
February last year I got together with my girlfriend, before that I had some moments with these things, but after we got together it all got worse.
I’ve been seeing them everyday since then. Every night the same thing keeps happening, and it’s always the one that I saw when I was in elementary. Those black eyes are so full of nothing that it’s just scary thinking of them, sometimes it’s standing right above me and looking down on me, smiling and waving as I fall asleep against my will. 
I think it’s making me sleep. Everytime after I fall asleep because of it I wake up with bruises on my body, once around my neck.
Sometimes it brings company, and there are 3-5 in my room just standing in different corners of my room staring at me with their empty black eyes.
They’re everywhere, even in day time, I can’t see them as I can when it’s nighttime but I know they’re here.

I don’t know what I did that they targeted me, I don’t even know if it has something to do with that thing that I saw in elementary, but I don’t also think that it matters. I just want to know why they came back after I got together with my girlfriend, did they sent her to make me more vulnerable or am I just overthinking way too much??

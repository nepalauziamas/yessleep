I wonder who the real demons are?

Lilith led the two of us by hand along the winding path. Snakes wound and unwound around me with each footfall. I fought the urge to scream at each snake's touch.

"Kekeke what's this?" Lilith cooed. "Are those… tears?"

"Lilith, don't be cruel. He's an idiot." Sean sighed.

"Is this cruel?" Lilith chortled, a tendril lifting me by my ankles. I felt myself fly through the air. All at once, cold, moist breath washed over my face. 

"We can't see." Sean said pointedly.

*Why is he doing this?"*

The tears that welled up began trickling up my forehead, absorbing into my hair. Crying upwards, not my proudest moment.

"Then OPEN them!" Lilith roared. Small teeth pierced my eyelids, prying my eyelids apart.

"No thanks!" I squeaked, shooting my hands to cover my eyes. Jagged fangs sank into my tender flesh, Lilith laughing like a maniac.

Snakes tugged my arms away. More snakes sank into my chin, forcing my lips apart… oh god… guhh

A thin, yellow tube slithered into my open mouth… and down my throat… The yellow tube disappeared down my throat, wriggling through my organs until finally settling somewhere in my abdomen.

I could see the silent manic laughter on Lilith's lips. Unlike other demons, she wore no mask. But damn was she gorgeous. Disgustingly so, beautiful beyond reason. 

"Pisss me off, and your ssstomach will blow! Kekeke!" Lilith warned with a wink. "Golly me, my tongue defiesss me!" She proceeded to stick a slender hand down her throat and wrench the writhing muscle free in one abhorrent SQUICK!

The otherworldly beauty slumped to the ground, a deflated husk. The hollow skin sat for a few moments, before something lurched. Like a cat in a blanket, the thing tossed and turned, until something pink and fleshy oozed out of its orifices. The meaty blob congealed in layers, taking on a humanoid shape. Its rippling edges slowed, then came to rest. Before my very eyes, an even more beautiful woman appeared.

"Ah molting, such a repulsive thing. Yes?" Another feminine voice probed.

"Yuh-" I started groggily, but Sean cut me off.

"No, ma'am." Sean answered, venom in his voice.

I fell hard as Lilith released me. "Mistress of the garden, how do you do?" Lilith greeted with a bow.

"So very good, so very very good!" The other woman emphatically announced, shifting through the dense woods. 

*Step, slide. Step step. Sliiide. Slide-step.*

Miss Vapors took awkward strides through the brush. Emerging from the foliage, I laid eyes on the deformed thing.

Welts and hives covered her exposed skin, with some non inflamed areas  sprinkled in, and others were nearly skeletal. How I wish I couldn't smell in that moment. Even the bugs dare not tread there.

Instinctively, my hand fumbled aroumd my belt, finding nothing. *Shit! My gun is still in hell!*

Her asymmetrical face wore a crooked smile, yellowed and blackened teeth from poor hygiene. "Huuuuuh NOO!" She wailed, steam rolling her way straight to me. "The BABY!"

Disoriented on the ground, I couldn't dodge. Her grimy, grotesque hands began probing around my stomach. Blubbery yet sharp fingers felt around, finding where the snake had curled up.

"There you are! Mommy's here now, this bad man can't hurt you anymore!" She cried, rendering the three of us speechless.

Surprisingly, the supermodel demon showed up at my side, prying the abomination off of me. "Honey, the alstroemerias are wilting." Lilith said in a honey sweet tone.

Like a squirrel before a dog, Miss Vapors bolted off into the woods.

Some time later, the rustling faded almost entirely. Lilith sighed, "poor thing. Ostracized herself over fears of *them* controlling her."

"THAT'S who we're supposed to interview?" I blurted, massaging the filth from where the woman had contaminated. The grime only spread and darkened.

Lilith grimaced, massaging her temples. "HigherHeavens are brilliant. Sending the most 'government secret agent' looking employee to someone who thinks the illuminati are trying to harvest her fingernails!"

"Incorrect, Lilith. This was, however unintentional, Josh's doing." Sean corrected, giving me far more credit than expected. Looking back, thanks man.

"Idiot!" Lilith fought a laugh. "You really screwed the pooch on this one, buddy boy."

"Lilith, I'm curious. Why do you and Krampus look after humans?" I asked absentmindedly, not expecting much.

I definitely did not expect what followed. 

Terrible cramps exploded through my bowels, worse than any post Arby's or Taco Bell experience. I doubled over, gasping for air, but no remedy came. Tighter and tighter my muscles clenched, until they hit a climax.

*SKYACK!* All at once, my stomach burst open, the yellow snake rocketing out. Midair, the snake seemed to shimmer, though that could have been my imagination. I was losing a considerable amount of blood.

"Lucyyy!!" Lilith gushed in her California girl voice. "It's been too long!" She darted at the shapeshifting reptile, embracing it before it landed.

It was a damn PowerRangers transformation. The tail split, arms formed, the head grew and took shape. Before I knew it, the snake had become a very handsome man. Sculpted muscles, chiseled chin, annnnd totally in the nude. Around his eyes, the man wore a simple masquerade style mask, adorned with a small pair of devil horns.

"Lilith! Indeed it has, indeed it has!" He announced in a melodic, deep tone. The man turned his gaze on me, cocking his head in confusion. "Was I-inside of him?!" He demanded.

Sheepishly, Lilith nodded, averting her eyes.

"Unnacceptable! I cannot have my employees suffer needlessly!" The man snapped.

With a wet *schlorp!* My innards were back to being innards, rather than outtards. The pain was gone, but the memory of it lingered, leaving me rattled and gasping for air.

"Good day to you, Jared. Please excuse Lilith's asinine stunt, be assured that she shall face consequences. Ah, Sam, great to see you!" He offered a hand to Sean, who shook it.

"To what do we owe this honor, sir Lucifer?" Sean asked, devoid of inflection.

"I simply wished to witness this most auspicious moment, Saul. For the four hundred, eighteen thousandth, seven hundred and second time in history, a mortal shall partake of the fruit!" He threw his arms up in excitement.

"Lucy, slight issue with that…" Lilith grimaced. "She refuses to eat anything she has not watched grow. I've watched it firsthand. She just sits there, watching seeds… unblinking…"

"Even more reason to feed her the fruit!" Lucifer posed, as though he was about to shout 'fire power!' 

"How brilliant, Lucy! You always were the brains!" Lilith cheered. She quickly regretted those words.

A massive pillar of white hot flame erupted around the she-demon, who broke out in agonized screams.

"You dare insult me!" He spat, smoke rushing from his ears. "First, you needlessly torture an employee. Second, you compliment my genius rather than my physicality. Stultus!"

*The fire isn't real. The fire isn't real.* I found myself repeating in my head, frozen and unable to retreat. I felt as my hair caught fire, burning away like a candle wick. Even Sean wasn't fairing well, eyes glazed over and body aflame.

Suddenly, the blobfish Miss Vapors burst through the brush once more, screaming "RAPTURE! JUDGEMENT IS HERE!"

The flame sputtered out, the prince of lies staring wide eyed, mouth agape. "Lilith. What is *that?*"

After some painful gasps, the crispy demon croaked "the one you have come for, sir." She collapsed, unmoving on the ground.

Sean stood still, deathly still. He wasn't even blinking.

"You, Jonah, fetch the fruit." Lucifer ordered, grabbing the woman by the chin and holding her in place. 

I frantically ran through the woods, desperate for a single fruit. Long dead plants, drowned from over watering, lined the ground.

Finally, I found it. The colossal tree seemed to reach the heavens themselves.

No time to marvel at the massive tree, I scoured for fruit. Mush like applesauce surrounded the stump. The only reason I knew these were apples was the poorly carved 'apul trie' in the bark.

Scooping the revolting muck up in my hands, I sprinted back to the fallen angel.

"Perfect, hand me the fruit, Johnson!"

I passed the toxic substance to the demon, who squished the substance in his fist.

He proceeded to shove his fist into the woman's mouth, knocking her few teeth out in the process.

Almost immediately, the woman began to glow with a brilliant, radiant light. In a blinding flash… absolutely nothing happened!

"Huh?!" Lucifer stammered, eyebrows raised.

"I already ate the damned fruit. I don't care about yer fancy facts or reality. I know the truth!" The woman insisted.

"She really is that stupid, sir." Lilith forced out, groaning in charred pain. "She knows everything, yet decides to live like this."

Lucifer did not stick around long after that, diffusing like smoke into the air.

So yeah, I met one of the higher-ups. It was a hell of a day, and I've been to hell.

The moral of today's story? Some people refuse reality. No amount of reasoning will change that.

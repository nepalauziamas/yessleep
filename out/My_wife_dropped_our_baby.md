August 1st, 2001, I remember that day. I had almost deleted it from my memory, until my phone rang. It was the same as how the phone rang that morning. 

We had been planning that morning for a while, my wife and I. It was supposed to be an easy day, drop off our daughter at the babysitter’s for the day, then attend her co-worker’s wedding. We had our outfits planned, and she even got her hair and nails done, because she was in the wedding party. I was hungry, and she was rushing around the house trying to dress our daughter, and make breakfast at the same time. I’m not afraid to admit that I wasn’t the best husband at the time, we just weren’t ready to have a kid, and as soon as she told me she was pregnant, everything changed. I had been miserable for far too long, it made me want to do nothing for our daughter. The late nights, the constant crying, the neediness. 

My wife only ever agreed with me, but her family was entirely against abortion, and she took that on, even as an adult, to keep the kid as our own, rather than put her up for adoption. I wished I had more say in the matter, but I just didn’t. 

This day could’ve gone in any direction, but that all changed when I heard a loud bang from the other room. 

“Babe?” I called out, and no response. 

“Fuck.” It had almost troubled me having to get up to see what had happened. The image I saw when I opened that door had changed things forever. It sent shivers down my spine, and left me in shock for years after that.

“Holy shit, what happened?!” I cried out. It was terrifying. Blood, all over the floor. The floor was tilted at such a slight angle, but the blood was spreading quickly. 
I couldn’t even move until I realized it had covered my favorite shoes. 

“She.. I wa-“ my wife was speechless, desperately trying to wipe up the blood with a small blanket, and desperately, while failing to doing so, “I dropped her.”

She was sobbing. I finally ran over to the lifeless body and picked it up. No signs of breathing, no heartbeat, and as I went to look at where she had hit her head, it was a bloody skull, cracked, dented, so badly I could see her pink brain. 

I almost threw up, as I sat there watching my wife covered in blood, screaming at the top of her lungs. 

“Shut up.” Was all I said, “SHUT UP AND LET ME THINK!” 

That’s when we formed the plan. 

“Okay. Okay. Okay. We-we’re just going- going to.. um..” I couldn’t form words. How do we get out of this situation?

“It wasn’t us.” My wife finally spoke, wiping her tears and standing up to me. She tried so hardly to not look down at the child in my arms. I secretly covered the wound with my hand, just so she didn’t have to see what I did. 

“We go, we go somewhere far away, and we bury her. We- we can go to the park. We can say we looked away for one second. We can say she just disappeared.” My wife continued. It sent shivers down my spine listening to her. We were just going to dump our child somewhere? We were just going to pretend I didn’t see bits of her brain lying on the floor? 

It made me wonder, just for a second, if any of this was an accident at all. 

But before I knew it, we were driving. I didn’t know where I was going, I just kept driving. My wife had bleached our whole house, with a story that i’m guessing she could tell police that she used bleach as a cleaner. I had no idea where she got those ideas, but I didn’t question any of them. 

It had to have been hours, my wife had gotten nonstop calls about why the hell we weren’t in attendance at the wedding, to each one she just stated our sitter flaked at last minute, so we decided to take our daughter to the park. 

It was dark now. I decided to pull over, which woke my wife up from the nap she decided to take. 

“Why’d we stop?”

“Let’s just do it here.”

We left the car and proceeded to the trunk, opening it to a bad smell, which almost knocked us back. 

“We have to hurry.” Was all she said, grabbing the shovel and wondering over to the ditch next to the road. 

It seemed like it had been days. I was just trying to get the images out of my head. I was trying to move on. But we had only just begun digging. There was a storm, the winds were blowing louder, and lightning was striking in the distant while loud booms of thunder warned us to get to shelter. I was praying my wife didn’t notice that I was crying. The rain hopefully covered up my tears. 

Finally, she spoke. “This is deep enough! We have to bury her!” She yelled over the noise. I couldn’t stop, though. I didn’t want this to be real. 

She shook her head at me in my state of shock, and went to grab our daughter. She was wrapped in a blanket from our trunk. I had let the shovel fall to the ground, I couldn’t do it anymore. I felt sick. 

Before I knew it, my daughter was underground. Had been killed and hidden away. By her own parents. By her own mother. 

It was just an accident. It was just an accident. It was just an accident. 

It was over, and I had to get on with life, like my wife told me. 

That’s what came to mind when the phone rang. It had been an entire decade. The problem is, that we had disconnected our phone not too long after that night, because every time it rang all I could think about was the bashed in skull of my infant. The shrilling wouldn’t stop. I had my hand on it, just terrified of what was on the other end. 

“Hello?” I answered. 

“Dad.” The voice answered. 
I immediately hung the phone up. 

I thought I was okay, until it shrilled again. I could feel the cold metal pressed against my hand, as if I still had the shovel gripped in my hand. 

I answered once more. I stayed silent. The voice finally spoke after moments of terrifying silence, all it said was,

“It wasn’t an accident.”

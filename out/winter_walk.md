a few years back, i lived in a small town in the middle of Sweden. in my five years of living there weird things would happen to me all the time. here is one of the things that happend first and really got me to write this.

i was walking my dog for an evening walk in december. i was about 10 at the time. it was very dark out and the only thing keeping me from going blind was the yellow lampposts. i was walking next to the road we drove on to my house. as i said it was a fairly small town so in this area, not many people were driving by. but it was also not unusual to see another person walking by the side of the road. anyway, i was walking and i could see maybe about 200 m a tall man was talking over to the side of the road i was walking on from the other side. i didnt think anything of it and kept walking. maybe 15 seconds later he suddenly stopped and looked back at me. thats when something inside of me told me to be on guard. he was now facing me maybe 150 m away. he was also now waving at me. i had now stopped and was wondering what to do. i wasnt exactly close to home so i thought that turning around and going back into the forest was a bad idea. we just stood there watching eachother for maybe 20 seconds. my dog was going crazy wanting to keep walking. i dont think my dog had seen the man yet becuase when she did she just stopped pulling the leash and just looked at me whining a little. i dont remember if i had a phone at the time of if i just had left it home but i didnt have a phone on me to call anyone. youre maybe thinking why i was so scared just when a man was waving to me and honesly i cant tell you. i doesnt sound very frightening but i had no idea of who the man was or why he was saying hello from such a distance. even if he knew me there was no chance he would be able to see my face of the color of my clothes due to the darkness. 

i was 100% not going to keep going so i thought my last resort was to walk back. i was just about to just that when he started sprinting towards me. my whole heart dropped and the adrenaline just kicked in like crazy and i ran the fastes i could back to where i came from. the forest was pitch black but i didnt care, i was too scared to care about my surroundings. i could hear the man screaming like a crazy man after me but i think i was faster than him so i eventually outran in. i didnt even relize i was crying until i opened my front door and locked it the same second i was inside. i had just been outside for maybe 15 min so my mother asked me why i had come home so early. i just dropped down to the floor and cried and i told my mom everything. supprisingly she took thing very seriously and went outside with my stepdad. a few min later they came back and told me that he was no where to be seen. my 10 year old self had never been so scared in my life. safe to say i didnt want to walk my dog in the dark in any near furture after that.

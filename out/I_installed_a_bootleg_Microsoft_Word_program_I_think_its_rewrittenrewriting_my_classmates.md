What is metamorphosis?

According to Google: 1 : a great change in appearance or character. 2 : the process of great and usually rather sudden change in the form and habits of some animals during transformation from an immature stage (as a caterpillar) to an adult stage (as a butterfly)

You could say metamorphosis happens in a teenager.

Those early stages of a person’s life, during puberty where they are finding themselves.

Most of the time, they find satisfaction. They find happiness.

But others? Others get bored. Others fail to find happiness, because it never really existed in them.

Noah Marrow first found real, genuine happiness when he almost microwaved his sister’s hamster.

Until then, happiness, an emotion he craved, was null in his life.

He had things he liked, sure. But they didn’t make him happy.

Like… Minecraft was a game all the kid’s played at school, and so did he. But it didn’t make him happy.

Birthday’s didn’t make him happy. When his mother brought out his eighth birthday cake, he smiled and clapped, because everyone else was doing it. It sort of scared him a little. Why he couldn’t feel like the other kids, and his parents. Why his stomach didn’t wobble on the night before Christmas, and holidays to Disneyland were fun, sure. But they didn’t make him happy. 

Noah was 8 years old when he first smiled for real. It wasn’t forced, like when he taught himself in the mirror to laugh and giggle. It was a real smile. And with it came genuine happiness; the kind of happiness he didn’t think was real, or that he was capable of feeling. It was a science experiment, initially. Being eight years old, he wanted to know how things ticked. How they lived and breathed and survived like him. What did their insides look like? Were they wriggling squiggles like he imagined?  Did other animals feel happiness? And if so, how could he find it? Was it something tangible he could touch?

His mother had banned him from her garden where he would pull out worms from the soil and slice them in half—so he needed another… subject. The subject being his little sister Eleanor’s hamster, who she didn’t have a name for. 

Eleanor loved the hamster. She was five years old, so anything fluffy was her whole heart. She sat in front of the TV with the little creature in her lap, occasionally patting it on the head. The hamster, surprisingly, didn’t try and get away. It was perfectly content in Eleanor’s lap. 

So, when Noah’s parents left to go to the store, he immediately snatched the hamster from Eleanor. Much to her disdain. It was her reaction which motivated him to continue. Just her quiet little squeak. It excited him, filling him with an energy Noah had never felt before. 

He laughed, and it felt good. It felt really good—and he wondered if this was what he was supposed to feel like all the time. Just like his family and friends. “I’m just playing a game!!” Was Noah’s mantra, as he marched into the kitchen with the hamster cupped in his hands. Just the idea was making him smile, no grin, his lips splitting apart. “Hey, Ellie.” His grin grew wider. “Do you want to see what its insides look like?”

“Huh?” Eleanor whimpered.

“It’s insides.” Noah laughed. “You know! All his squiggly parts!”

His sister stared blankly at him for a moment, before shaking her head and rubbing at her eyes.

“Give him back.” she whispered, reaching out. “Noah, give him back!”

Giggling, Noah danced backwards, almost tripping over himself. “I’m just playing a game. Come on!”

Eleanor followed him, a mess of pigtails and runny nose, tears streaked down her cheeks—and this delighted him. 

His sister’s expression was something Noah had never seen before. He grabbed a chair and jumped onto it, climbing on the countertop and yanking open the microwave door. This sent Eleanor into a frenzy, screeching and jumping up and down, sobbing, her eyes wide, lips twisted. Noah watched her, the hamster squirming in his cupped hands. He was never going to do it. Worms were one thing, they were just slimy shoe-laces he could stamp on. 

But the hamster was a real living thing. When he lifted it in the air and frowned at its tiny little face, its twitching nose—a little part of Noah felt for the little thing. He began to giggle, though, because it was the pure despair of his sister which made him feel light, like he was flying, or even dancing. If this was happiness, then he wanted to keep feeling it. Noah flashed his sister a grin. “Say goodbye to Hammy, Ellie.” He teased, before placing the hamster inside, and shutting the door slowly, excruciatingly slowly, to make it even more painful for the little girl.

Eleanor screamed, and her expression, her eyes riddled with pain and fear, made him smile wider.

His fingers hovered over the buttons, heart pounding. Noah swallowed and weighed the options in his head. If he pressed the on button, the hamster would almost surely go splat, and he would finally see what made the little thing tick. But… but another thought was blossoming, too invasive to ignore. Noah situated himself on the counter and crossed his legs, leaning on his palm. He could just… watch. Eleanor was in hysterics, screaming and jumping up and down, begging him to let the hamster go. 

His little sister was a blur, and it was a good blur. A funny blur. It was so funny the way her lips kept moving, and nothing was coming out. Her throat must have been bust. When Eleanor seemed to realise he wasn’t going to press the button, she stopped. She just…. stopped. Her tears stopped, snot and drool and gross little girl spit all over her face. 

It all stopped. 

But Noah didn’t like that. His fists clenched, fingernails stabbing into his knees. Straightening up, he surveyed the little girl with a frown. He wanted… he wanted her to dance, he thought. Yeah, like just like she had been doing before it clicked in her brain he wasn’t going to do it. Well, Eleanor didn’t know that, and Noah realised, a sickening satisfaction curling in his gut, that he liked the way his sister’s expression twisted, her eyes widening with fear that he was going to do it again.

This was what made him happy, Noah thought.

He didn’t like microwaving hamster’s or stamping on worms. That wasn’t it.

Well, he did. But there was something else he liked even more.

Smirking, Noah hovered his finger over the on button and Eleanor came back to life, her eyes welling with tears.

He liked watching other’s react. He liked seeing the pain on their faces, the disgust and fear twisting their lips. Noah liked watching the worst possible scenario flash in their eyes, and the hopelessness build up, filling them with unbridled despair.

Luckily, Noah’s parents came back before he could do what he really wanted to do, which was to turn the dial.

The microwave was unplugged... but his sister didn’t know that. So, he jumped down and placed the hamster in Eleanor's cupped hands. When his sister told their parents, Noah enjoyed being yelled and screamed at. He loved the word “psychopath” being thrown in his face by his father, and his mother’s eyes raw from crying, her trembling when she held him and swore to herself that there was nothing wrong with her son—he was perfectly fine, and she had raised him right. But Noah didn't listen to her, or his father, or Ellie still screaming and pressing the hamster to his cheek. 

He was already coming up with ways to smile again, to feel that kind of happiness, the feeling of flying, floating above the clouds. Noah wanted that again, and it wouldn’t come with his stupid things like birthday’s or holiday’s. Noah Marrow decided he was going to make people hurt. Just like his parents and little sister.  At 8 years old he couldn’t really do much, and excluding worms, Noah liked animals. 

When he was 10 years old, his aunt was in a car crash. She survived, luckily, and she looked funny wrapped in bandages. Noah laughed the first time he saw her. He enjoyed that laugh, the kind of laugh which made his whole body shake. 

Despite being the “problem child” between him and his sister, Noah was his aunt’s favourite, and she insisted he stay with her while the rest of the family went to get ice-cream. Noah did love his aunt. She was funny and told him some really cool stories. He had memories of her trying to make him laugh when he was a kid—and he did. But he didn’t feel what he was supposed to feel. After explaining his feeling to his aunt, the woman looked kind of startled, and maybe a little scared.

“Can you go and get your dad?” She asked, her voice a little strained, especially with the way he was looking at her. Noah was sitting across the room, sitting stiff in a chair, one leg crossed over the other, his eyes drinking in every contortion in his aunt’s expression. Instead of answering, he jumped up, dancing over to the bleeping machinery sitting by the hospital bed.

Noah pointed to a tube, cocking his head. “Aunt Jane,” he said. “What does this do?”

Aunt Jane’s eyes widened, and Noah enjoyed that, the flicker of fear igniting.

“Noah, get your father.” She said strictly, and when his fingers entangled around the wire hanging around the back, the woman made a squeaking noise, which made him laugh. Noah teased the wire, pulling on it, and Aunt Jane turned ashy white.

“Nurse!” She cried. “Could I…” Her breath came out in heavy gasps, and Noah treasured each one. “Could I get some help?”

Smirking, Noah’s fingers tip-toed over to the outlet the machinery was plugged into.

But he never pulled.

That wouldn’t be fun. That wouldn’t make him smile.

However, watching his aunt struggle under breathing tubes and equipment he couldn’t name, made him feel all floaty and light again. He never pulled the plug, because that would mean losing his aunt—and he didn’t want to lose her.

Noah just wanted her to feel like him—to feel this intense happiness at the thought of losing air and crumbling down, down, down. It wasn’t just other’s he liked to watch feel this sensation. When Noah was fifteen years old, he went home every night and locked himself in his room, and he cut into the backs of his hands until there was so much red, so much red pooling, pretty scarlet smearing his hands and spattering every surface he grasped when he felt that intoxication take hold. 

Euphoria in its endless purest form. 

That is what made him smile. That is what made him happy, what ignited the synapses in his brain. 

So, if Noah had to think of a reason why he felt like this… he would say…

Metamorphosis.

His own metamorphosis.

Isla’s cry sliced into his thoughts, the same question repeated in a shriek.

“What is wrong with you?!”

Blinking his eyes open, Noah didn’t realise he’d been enveloped in his own mind, his own memories. Reality seeped to the surface. He was standing in a classroom in front of Isla Soren, and Caleb Marks. 

Both Valedictorians. It had been Noah’s idea to tie them up. They didn’t really need  to, but he just really liked the idea of them being bound together. 

Like it was fate which had brought them here—or some shit like that. The candlelight hadn’t been his idea, it was more of an aesthetic choice, for atmosphere. In the flickering light, though, Noah felt anticipation building inside him.  It was perfect. Everything was perfect. The perfect kidnapping, snatching the two of them from their beds—and soon it would be the perfect murder. Though not before he had his fun, of course. Noah had spent his life waiting for people to reach that moment between life and death, the instant when the fear of death really hits home, and they can do nothing but accept it. He was finally going to see that.

His classmates were finally going to feel like him. Caleb hadn’t moved in a while, his head of dark curls bowed, a streak of scarlet staining the boy’s temple from Tommy’s hit. He shivered at the sight of it, not the blood—well yeah, of course the blood. 

But the sight of someone like Caleb Marks completely fucking hopeless. God, it was enough to motivate a hit he was already fashioning, his fingers sliding around the blade clenched in his fist. It was Isla’s sobbing which set him off, teeth grinding together in a grin. Noah felt it everywhere, shivers slipping down his spine, that same sensation which had haunted him since he was a kid. It was a craving. He wanted to hurt, and he wanted other people to hurt. He wanted them to feel just like him.

Isla’s question was still swimming around his brain, which had taken him back to that first spark—when he first felt it.

What was wrong with him? Noah had to think about that.

The others were silent, awaiting his answer. Tommy was whistling, his gaze on his phone, Lily circling the two like a shark.

An odd selection; Thomas Carlisle, a well-known jock, and president of the school newspaper, and Lily Kenji, the girl who said maybe one word every two weeks. He wasn’t really sure why it was them he had chosen to be his followers, his acolytes. Maybe it was because Tommy had a semblance of influence, and Lily was in need of actual friends who didn’t care about her lisp. They were waiting for him to speak, but if he was honest with himself, he didn’t actually know why he felt like this.

Why he wanted to feel like this.

“I dunno.” Noah finally said, shrugging. He frowned at the teeth of his blade. “I just like it, man.”

“Like it?” Caleb didn’t raise his head. “Bullshit. I know why you’re doing this.”

Tommy’s attention pricked. “Oh, yeah?” He rounded the chair, leaning into the boy. “Wanna take a guess?”

“Isn’t it obvious?” Isla whispered, struggling in the bindings. “It’s because we’re at the top. We’re the best.”

There was a pause, and Noah could have sworn he could hear the cogs in Lily’s brain turning.

Huh. Noah frowned. He hadn’t actually given a reason to why they had taken Isla and Caleb.

Lily and Tommy knew about his… craving. They wanted it too. That’s why they were here, after all.

But as for why it was Caleb and Isla in the first place. Why it was them, and not anyone else.

Huh. He didn’t know.

“Boss.” Clearing his throat, Tommy shot an impatient look at Noah--


... 


Wait.


I stopped typing, letting out a single breath, and then backspacing the last line.

No, “Boss” was too campy.

I wasn’t writing a fucking Yakuza story.

As the fictional world slowly bled away, I was greeted to reality. 4th period English class. Plucking out an earphone, the buzz of white noise which were my classmates slammed into my ears, and I squinted at my laptop screen, at the 2K word document on screen. 

I couldn’t afford Microsoft Word, which the school refused to get a licence for, and Google Docs didn’t have full screen mode, or at least one that satisfied me—so, after some googling, I found a free trial for a BETA word processor. It was just Microsoft Word in dark mode. I’d been warned against downloading programs onto my laptop, but this one seemed genuine. I downloaded it in a rush to get the creative writing over and done with. But I wasn’t anticipating exactly what I’d write. 

The story had started off as an assignment, and I’d gotten maybe a little carried away with it. I don’t know what about it was so appealing. Well, that’s what I told myself. Looking around my classroom and blinking away brain-fog, I knew exactly why I couldn’t stop writing it.

“Whatcha writing?”

I jumped, halfway through draining my bottle of water. I hadn’t noticed Isla Soren leaning over my desk. She had a habit of doing that, and yet I never knew when she was going to pop out of nowhere with that mischievous smile, dark red hair in its usual unbrushed blur. Almost choking on my water, I struggled to close my MacBook, but that only intrigued her further, and  the girl situated herself in front of my desk, folding her arms across her chest. 

“Tell me. It must be good.”

“Good?” I raised a brow.

“Yeah! You’ve been typing like crazy, for like an hour.”

“I was in the zone.” I said.

“Well, you must have been writing something spicy.” Isla smirked. “I wanna see.”

“It’s just a story.” I said, suddenly far too protective over my laptop.

“I got that! But what’s it about? Is it a romance?”

Isla leaned closer, her hair brushing my neck. “Crime?”

Closer. I could feel her breath tickling my ear. “…Horror? Oooh, is it Stephen King Esque?”

There was no way I could explain what I had written, especially her and Caleb Marks about to meet their grisly demise.

Okay, so, I should probably say this before you continue reading.

I suck at making characters. I try to make them, but they feel empty. Hollow.

So, I use the next best thing. 

Why come up with fleshed out characters when they already existed around me? 

My classmates were inches away from me, and I’d moulded them into fucking psychopaths.

And when that realisation hit me, that I’d written Isla’s death, and it was on the screen for her to read—I slammed the laptop shut. My gaze wandered the classroom, subconsciously finding my story’s real-life counterparts. In my story, Isla and Caleb were the smartest kids in the class. Both of them Harvard bound.

I’m not good at building plot, so I figured Noah would take them because they were smart. But did he really care when all he wanted to do was feel people’s pain? 

I hadn’t thought that through. I glimpsed Lily Kenji sitting on the edge of her desk, talking animatedly to a group of girl’s—Tommy Carlisle bent over a book, his expression creased in concentration, and finally, Noah Marrow trying and failing to hide the fact he was playing his Switch under his desk. I may have overexaggerated them a little. Or a lot. 

The truth is, the three of them are just normal kids. Lily Kenji isn’t a mute, and Tommy isn’t an asshole. If I could put Noah in a category, it would be the class clown. He stayed quiet most of the time, either playing video games or enveloped in a comic book—but sometimes he would just tell a joke to a room full of silence, and it would be so out of place and random, kids would laugh. Noah didn’t have a little sister, and I ripped the hamster idea from a bad dream I had when I was a kid when I accidentally microwaved my pet mouse.

Looking at all of subjects of my story and realising down fucked up I’d made their fictional versions, I had a sudden overwhelming urge to destroy the document. I hadn’t just written them into a story, I’d given them backstories why they were messed up. And I had more planned. I had a whole chapter where Noah just goes fucking crazy and slaughters his family, and it was all there in my notes. 

Isla was a friend, but there was no way I was letting her eyes graze Document 2. I wouldn’t let it get to that. She, however, was far too interested in what I had been writing to notice my clear discomfort.

“Come on, Connor.” The girl fixed me with a grin. “Dude, you’ve gone tomato red! What are you writing?”

“Porn.” I deadpanned.

Isla cocked her head. “Do you mean erotica?”

I nodded, but she wasn’t buying it.

“I don’t believe you. I think you’re writing something even more sacrilegious.”

This time, her voice was loud enough for everyone to hear, and I bit back a frustrated hiss.

I wanted to get back to the story—back to the fictional world I’d created.

Where Isla was begging for her life.

Something panged in my chest, a coil of dread unravelling in my gut.

Did I really want to go back there? Where one of my friend’s was about to get ripped apart?

“Leave him to write whatever, Isla.” Noah didn’t look up from his game. “Shockingly, you’re not funny.”

“But I want to know what he’s writing!”

“Nothing for you.” He finally lifted his head, settling the girl with a small smile. “Clearly.”

Isla jutted her chin, and I was intrigued too. 

Noah wasn’t one to join class discussion.

“Why are you so interested, Noah?"

“I’m not.” Noah went back to his game. “You’re yelling, and it’s hard to concentrate. I’m about to evolve.”

“Well, maybe if you actually pay attention in class.” Isla’s smile was spiteful, “Instead of playing weird games.”

“I'm already finished.” Noah held up his workbook with one hand. “Also, Pokémon isn’t a weird game.”

Isla’s smile dampened.  She was running out of retorts. “At least I’m not the teacher's pet!”

“Are we in middle school?” He didn’t even entertain a smile, and Isla’s expression darkened.

In my story, she was valedictorian and one of the smartest in the class.

In real life, she was only valedictorian because Noah had stepped down—and her grades were slipping fast.

I guess I was maybe a little inspired from their low-key rivalry through passive aggressive conversation, and a constant desire to one up each other. Noah didn’t reply to her, instead settling his head into his arms, stabbing buttons on his Switch.

Eventually, Isla left me alone, after poking me in the forehead and making me promise to show her the finished piece.

“I want to read all of it when it’s finished, okay?” Isla’s intense eyes were hard to look away from.

“Sure.” I nodded, rubbing at my forehead. 

She really knew how to poke.

“All of it, Connor!” Isla hopped back to her desk. “I want the full, unedited masterpiece.”

After making sure she was gone, I went back to the document. But a box had popped up in the middle of the screen, stopping me from writing anything else. 

“FREE TRIAL ENDED” it said in caps. 

“UPGRADE TO PREMIUM?” 

Premium? I didn’t even have cash to buy the official version. Clicking out of the box, I tried to go back to the story, but the box wouldn’t leave. Every click, it seemingly grew bigger on the screen. There was no way to copy and paste the text I’d already written, or even take a screenshot. 

Instinctively, I reached out for my water, knocking it over in the process, half of the contents soaking my MacBook. 

Isla squeaked, and I could tell she had been watching me, probably waiting for me to start typing again. I jumped up and did my best to clean up the mess with the sleeve of my jacket, but when I set up the laptop on an empty desk, the screen was black. Water damage. When I pressed the power button, the keyboard flashed electric blue for a moment, before flickering off. The laptop was on, but the screen wasn’t lighting up like usual.

After excusing myself from the class, I ended up in the boy’s bathroom, sitting in a stall with the computer on my knee, a roll of toilet paper clenched in my fist. Part of me knew it was hopeless, but still, I scrubbed at the damp keyboard, praying the stupid thing came back to me. In my freshman year, I spilled soda on my old HP, which wouldn’t even light up. 

The MacBook was powering on, and it seemed to be working—everything except the screen. All of my assignments and everything I needed were on my memory drive, but the story wasn’t. It was trapped on the Word Hop 2022 program, stuck behind a paywall. Even if the laptop started working again, I had to pay to get the story back. You will probably judge me for thinking this, but no matter how disrespectful and morally wrong it was, I didn’t want to lose it. I wanted to continue it. It was the most fun I’d had in a while. And I didn’t even like creative writing. 

“Connor?”

I didn’t even notice the door opening, footsteps joining with the drip, drip, drip of bathroom ambience.

Tommy Carlisle.

One of my… stencils. 

“Are you good, man? Mr Wainwright’s getting pissed.”

Tearing my eyes from my laptop screen, I glanced at the gap between the stall door. Tommy’s sneakers tapped impatiently.

“Yeah.” I said. “I’m just having trouble with my laptop.”

He clucked his tongue. “Ah. What’s wrong with it?”

“I spilled water on it.”

“Oh, shit. It’s probably toast.”

I rolled my eyes. “Thank you for the reassurance.”

“Any time, dude.”

My attention went back to the screen. I opened my mouth to answer him, but the screen lit up suddenly, my story flashing onto the screen. It was exactly how I’d left it. When I tried the keyboard, it worked, and so did the tracking pad. Before I could do anything, I saved the document, and then copied and pasted it into a Google Doc. Tommy was still there. He knocked on the stall door. “Dude, come on. Hurry it up. Wainwright wants us both back in class.”

I bit back a frustrated hiss. “Yeah, just give me a minute.”

“A minute?” Tommy groaned. “You’ve been here for nearly half an hour! I need to pee.”

“Pee then.” I gritted back.

“I can’t!”

Ignoring Tommy, I focused on the document. It looked to be locked. I could type in Google, and use any other program normally, but the word document was frozen. I gave up typing and tried to click off the program as a whole, but it wouldn’t close down. After several attempts, my patience waning, I figured it was a problem I could fix at home. I started to close the lid, when the screen suddenly flashed once again, this time taking me into the BIOS. I wasn’t too familiar with the BIOS—only from YouTube tutorials I had when I had basic start up problems. 

But this was different. I expected the PC specs to appear, or some kind of error code. Instead, however, the first sentence to my story flashed up in white, followed by the second, and the third. My story was appearing in lines, running down the screen, and no matter what I did—stabbing the power button and ESC key—it kept going. Like it had a mind of its own. Slowly, I stood up, swallowing something slimy crawling up my throat. 

“Tommy?” My gaze flashed to the gap between the stall door, and I glimpsed his sneakers still there. That was reassuring. A buzzing sound caught my attention, and when I lifted my head, the world suddenly tipped to the left—and then the right.

The world blurred around me, and I reached out, grasping the walls. I felt like I was going to faint.

The bulb above me sputtered, before going out. I remember feeling tired, so fucking tired, my body giving up and slumping to the ground. There was an invisible noose around my neck, pulling, pulling, pulling,  but never going as far as choking me. 

When my vision cleared enough for me to see in front of me, I twisted around, my stomach diving into my throat. Tommy’s expensive shoes were there one minute, and in the eerie glow of my laptop screen lighting up the stall—gone. 

“Tommy?” I hissed again, my words coming out slurred, like the ability to speak had suddenly been torn from me. It was suddenly so hard to push words out, like something was stopping me, a heavy weight on my chest, words tangled in my throat. Pushing the door open, the boy’s bathroom was empty. A prank, I thought—surely. I wouldn’t expect anyone other than Isla to be the perpetrator. 

She had been dying to get me back after I shoved her face in a strawberry sundae for her 16th birthday.

With her name in my mouth, I pulled open the boy’s bathroom door, and was once again greeted to darkness. It enveloped the hallway, a line of lockers standing in the eerie glow emitting from my phone’s shitty flashlight. But that couldn’t be right.

It was 2 in the afternoon. As I headed down what had been a packed school hallway, however, I quickly came to realise that was no longer the reality. 

The windows were pitch black, and when I glimpsed at the time on my phone, there was no mistake. It was half past eleven at night. I thought back to the world spinning around me and blurring—maybe I had a head injury. Maybe I’d gotten an electric shock from the laptop and everything I saw was a vivid hallucination while paramedics were currently performing lifesaving CPR.

Nothing made sense. That became more obvious as the corridor I had walked so many times for almost four years, didn’t have an ending. It kept going—and I passed the same classrooms, the same locker’s, the same posters on the walls. I knew exactly how the hallway ended. 

It ended with double doors leading up to the English rooms, and an elevator to the ground floor’s reception. I had passed the same classroom 6 times before something moved at the corner of my eye. The shadow darted out of the dark. It was a cat. I followed it at first, watching it slink through the dark. When I was close enough to see its profile bleed into my flashlight’s allure, something twisted in my gut, worming its way into my throat. The cat was a black and white tabby with white paws. My footsteps alerted it, and it twisted its head to look at me.

I recognised the cat—and I knew exactly what it was going to do.

Because I had written it in my notes. I wasn’t sure about adding the cat scene, so it was just an idea in my notes—scrappy writing I was planning on adding somewhere. But I knew I’d written that it was a black and white tabby with white paws. I wanted to insert myself into the story in some way, and this was the only way I knew how. That I would be in the school in the middle of the night, for reasons I was still trying to figure out. I was walking down the hallway, and I saw a tabby cat.

I remembered exactly what I’d written. Again, it was just notes. It wasn’t even part of the story.

“Connor wasn’t sure why he was at school late. He found himself restless, and it wasn’t a secret that the school was easy to break into. There was a window on the ground floor office which was never locked. In the past, kids had slipped inside and held parties in the auditorium or snuck had late-night date’s in the pool. Connor wasn’t there for leisure, however. Something had been bugging him about the way his classmates had been acting. It wasn’t really behaviour which would immediately raise a red flag—but something was definitely odd about several of them. Especially after Isla had mysteriously disappeared. Her parents insisted she was fine, and the rumour mill spoke of boarding school, but Connor was sceptical.”

The words were in my head, and I remembered my fingers dancing across the keyboard, bringing the scene to life.

“Taking slow and steady strides, Connor blinked into the endless stretch of oblivion around him—a hallway which seemed to go on forever. And then he saw it. It jumped into the alure of his flashlight, a black and white tabby cat on its night prowl.”

I was subconsciously mumbling what I’d written, the whole cat scene, as the events folded in front of me. Exactly what I’d written. Stumbling back, I bit back a yell when the cat hissed at me, before diving into an empty classroom which hadn’t been there a second ago. 

Something ice-cold slipped down my spine. I’d written this. I’d written the cat hissing and running away, and a classroom appearing out of fucking nowhere. My body seemed to move on its own, like I was a puppet on someone else’s strings. The night I wrote these notes, I was tired and pissed from a homework task which was driving me crazy. I wrote shit that didn’t even make sense. I just wrote things that would be in any other horror story. The slam of a door. 

The dripping of a leaky faucet. 

I jumped, startled, when the noise cut into the silence. But I kept going. I kept walking, my breath tangled in my throat, knowing what I’d written. And knowing that somehow, whatever I’d written on document 2 was bleeding into reality.

The classroom was familiar. I never wrote a full description, so I only saw what I had written in an unedited mess. 

The glow of candle light set my thoughts into a frenzy. The door was half open, and I risked a peek—just like I’d written in the story. I saw the shadows of Lily and Tommy first, circling two figures bound together. Isla and Caleb, the two of them tied back to back. In reality, it looked so much more painful than I’d written. I never wrote or described the lacerations in their wrists from the ropes, or bruises on Isla’s face from phantom attacks I’d only written scraps of. 

No matter how much I told myself I was seeing things, that I was losing my mind, this was real. My story was playing out right in front of me.  Isla was sitting with her head held high, a pained cry gritted on her lips, while Caleb’s head was bowed, a streak of red smearing his temple from Tommy swinging his bat. Craning my neck, I struggled to see the main perpetrator, but Noah was hidden behind the rest of them. If I remembered correctly, this was the point where he had been playing Isla’s question in his mind and reminiscing about his childhood—his metamorphosis. With him stuck in his thoughts, the others looked to be frozen, waiting for the scene to continue. I never finished it, I thought. Isla interrupted me, and I never got to finish it, so was this where it was going to end?

“What is wrong with you?!” Isla screeched again, struggling violently. She screamed, when Tommy pressed his hand over her mouth, and I winced. I didn’t remember writing that. Not in my notes, at least.  “Shut the fuck up. God, you’re annoying.”

Tommy’s gaze flicked to Noah. “Dude. Answer her question.”

I didn’t write that either.

It was almost like the scene was playing out on its own.

“I dunno.” Noah stepped into the light, and just like I’d written, his fingers were wrapped around a blade. He fixed the two with the same smile I’d grown tired of writing. There’s only so many times you can write “psychotic smile” before the description itself grows tedious. Still, though, he was the perfect mimic of how I’d written him. His expression mirroring my exact words. Horrifying or not, there was something disturbingly beautiful about the way he moved exactly the way I’d wrote, everything from his expression to his erratic bouncing on the heels of his toes, the smile growing on his face, eyes glinting with an insanity which shouldn’t exist—I found myself filled with a sense of… pride. 

My writing was blossoming to life, and they were my canvases. My characters. No longer the boring versions they had been earlier in class, now they had been filled with life, a spark which had been ignited.  Tommy, grabbing a fistful of Caleb’s hair and yanking it back with a delighted laugh, Lily crouching in front of Isla, and tracing the teeth of her knife across the girl’s cheek. Just small things I’d added for body. Noah—transformed from the class clown gamer kid, to a cold blooded psychopath who only craved one thing. I knew exactly what he was thinking. 

Because I’d written it.

He wanted to make them hurt. 

Because he liked it. Hurting. 

He wanted everyone to hurt.

Pride, however, made way for disgust. I shook my head of the thought.

“I just like it, man.” Noah murmured. He followed Lily, crouching in front of Isla, who let out a sharp screech.

“Like it?” Caleb spoke through his teeth. His gaze was glued to the ground. He sniffled. “Bullshit.”

Tommy frowned. “Oh, yeah?” He scoffed, leaning close to Caleb. “Wanna take a guess?”

I couldn’t move. No matter how hard I tried, I was frozen in the doorway. Watching.

This was where the story ended.

Isla tipped her head back, a hearty sob escaping her lips. “Isn’t it obvious?” She whispered. “We’re at the top.”

Her gaze found Noah’s. “We’re the best.”

There was a pause, the group going stiff. Noah, glaring at Isla, and his cronies waiting impatiently for his response.

It was going to end,  I thought. 

Surely.

Instead, though, Noah shrugged. “I mean, sure.” He chuckled. “That’s one reason.”

In one stride, he was in front of the girl, and in a single strike, he was slicing her throat open. I only stayed long enough to watch sharp red pool, and Isla’s choked cry bleeding into Caleb’s, when Lily plunged her blade into his stomach with a demanted grin.  But I didn’t write that. I never fucking wrote that. I never wrote Noah twisting around, his eyes catching mine, and my stumbling feet staggering back onto the corridor. 

I didn't write their thundering footsteps coming after me, their manic laughter and whooping as they called my name. I went back to the boy’s bathroom, ignoring their battering fists on the door. My laptop was still sitting on the basin, its screen flashing. 

My story was still being typed out, but they weren’t my words. I caught the most recent line: “Fuck!” Connor’s yell was stuck in his throat as he ran, his thoughts whirring. He entered the boy’s bathroom, and found his MacBook sitting on the basin, his story being written right in front of him.”

The cursor stopped suddenly, and a box came up.

“PREMIUM?” It asked.

Followed by another: “Young man, surely you must have learned by now. Never download bootlegs 😊”

The screen flashed back to the story, which had paused. Fiveseparate screens came up, and peering closer, I glimpsed familiar names. Isla. Tommy. Caleb. Noah. Lily, and mine. Strings of code in glowing green ran down the screen, but the laptop, or the program, had a mind of its own. 

It was highlighting code and deleting it. I watched Noah’s entire screen highlighted in white before the code disappeared. And outside, the battering of fists on the door stopped. Next was Lily, and then Tommy.

It was deleting them. Everything which was them, who I knew before—it was highlighting parts of them, their existence, and plunging them into oblivion. Like deleting the human psyche was that easy. 


I could only watch, my feet glued to the ground, as it started to type new code in each box, sometimes copying and pasting paragraphs of gibberish which didn’t make sense. It was just binary, unintelligible code. Numbers and letters. But I knew this thing—this thing which had taken over my laptop, was rewriting them. Like it was teasing me, the cursor finally went to my separate box, and I found myself face to face with everything I was, written right there. I didn’t feel the first deletion. It was like the prick of a needle. When the second line disappeared, however, my arms slipped to my sides, my mouth drooping. Like having a stroke, my face contorted as the program highlighted text, deleted and pasted, rewriting parts of me. 

I don’t know how I was still watching.

I think I was. I was, and then I wasn’t. I was on my knees, and then I was lying face down, my senses were gone.

Sight, touch, smell, hearing. There was nothing.

There was nothing, until… there was something.

They were crowded around me. Noah, Tommy, and Lily.

Isla, or what was left of her, was on the ground, already severed from the torso.

Somehow, she was still whimpering into the ground, screeching into wet concrete.

Noah knelt and plunged the knife into her skull and twisted it, and her cry sliced into the silence. He lifted his head with a smile.

“See?” He said, his tone was like a teacher. Noah was bouncing on his heels like a hyperactive child. 

“Told ya she’d scream.”

Straightening up, the boy sighed,  blowing a raspberry. “Alright. Where’s Caleb?”

I don’t remember much after that. I lost time, and found myself in places I’ve never been before, places which shouldn’t exist in reality, written by the program. My body is like a fucking puppet, following every word the program wrote. I became aware standing in an alleyway, cool air grazing my face. My hands were slick with something—blood. I could sense the thing inside my head, a parasite,  asking if I like the feeling, twisting my thoughts into a craving, a craving to paint myself in Isla’s remains.

In a blur, only when I snatched back my thoughts after smashing my head into the concrete wall—again and again and again, until my teeth were cracked and pain was writhing, did I finally manage to get away from them. I went back to the laptop, and I tried to smash it against the wall. 

But it wasn’t breaking. Right now, the program has stopped writing. But it’s already done what it wanted. It’s rewritten them, and it’s rewritten parts of me too. The thing seems to be on standby. It’s letting me move freely right now, but I don’t know its next steps. I think it wants me to write to you. It wants a chance to show off. It's trying to write my original idea.

Metamorphosis.

Not just with Noah.

All of us.

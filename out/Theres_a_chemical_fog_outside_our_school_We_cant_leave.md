The view from our classroom windows is nothing but a murky white. I bet if I went outside and looked down, I wouldn’t be able to see past my knees. I won’t be going outside, though— I honestly don’t think I’ll leave this classroom for a while.


Our class (Gothic Literature) was supposed to end at 1:30. I remember just staring at the clock, watching the seconds tick by, feeling Mr. Samson’s voice drone through my body, the monotone sound killing me into a haze of sleepy existence. I didn’t get much sleep last night, and it certainly shows. The classroom was lit solely by the fluorescent bulbs flickering on the ceiling, Samson having closed the blinds to avoid ‘distracted glances’ about fifteen minutes in.

 I wonder now if we would have noticed the building fog outside had the blinds been open. Maybe we would have clamored together by the window, whispering in excitement to each other— anything that wasn’t hearing, for the tenth time that week, how revolutionary Mary Shelley was for that time. Or hearing Susan beg him to cover Carmilla, ‘just for half a lesson, Mr. Samson?’ It isn’t unusual for a mess of high schoolers to grow distracted and excited at any little change. I mean, who can blame us, with the constant repetition? Regardless, I’ve gone too far off topic.

It was about ten minutes before the bell was supposed to buzz, signifying the seven minute long break from our daily torture, that the intercom system crackled to life.


“We will now be having a lockdown drill. We request everyone stay calm, and follow the instructions of their current teacher. If you’re outside your classroom, we ask that you please make your way back in a timely manner. Thank you.” 

I heard the collective groans of students who didn’t want to crawl under their desks in the dark. Really, the only thing worse than this lecture is the singular sound of your deskmate’s breathing penetrating a heavy cover of silence. Nevertheless, we’re used to lock down drills by now. The class shuffled slowly, desks creaking as students stood and crouched. Susan shoved herself under the teachers desk, whilst Jaimee and Audrey stood shoulder to shoulder in the tiny alcove just behind the doorway. We all waited with frustrated bated breaths, knowing that in just a few seconds we’d hear someone try the doorknob (apparently to scare us— it never works) and then the intercom system announce the drill was over. But those sounds didn’t come. Instead, all there was? Silence. 

The reintroduction of sound started with a couple in the back corner whispering and giggling to each other. Students, growing more impatient, began talking to each other. It took ten minutes before Mr. Samson himself moved to his desk, shooing Susan out in the process, in an attempt to get some work done.

Ten more minutes passed. He grew frustrated, and motioned us back to our seats. That was when someone peeked outside. I’m not sure what they were looking for— maybe to see if this was a different sort of drill, or if maybe it wasn’t a drill at all. It didn’t take long for everyone else to be made aware of the oddity that was the outside world.

“Hey guys? I can’t see outside. It’s like, hella foggy.” I think her name was Ashley. I worked on a lab project with her once.

“Shit, she’s right.” A guy chimed in from across the room. “Jesus, that’s some massive blockage. Imagine driving in that.”

“It can’t be foggy, it’s not even humid out. Plus, already lunchtime. Way too late for fog.” Susan snorted. You know. Like a smartass.

“Well, it’s clearly something. Do you think it’s fucking with the cellphone towers? I don’t have any reception.” Ashley spoke again. 

“Guys, come on. No phones in class. We just touched on this day before yesterday.”

Despite Samson’s protests, there was a quiet murmur of agreement. People who’d either checked their phones prior and noticed the same thing, or those who were checking them now and...well, noticing the same thing.

“Weather does screwy things, guys. Who knows.” I finally interjected my own opinion, shrugging my shoulders. A few more murmurs, slowly growing louder in volume as friends and deskmates began talking to each other to alleviate the boredom.

Five minutes later, whatever the weather is doing to our phones clearly has done something else. Our electric went out. We could still connect to the WiFi (obviously, I’m writing this, aren’t I?) but nothing else. Lights burnt out, the projector wouldn’t turn on, even the hum of the air conditioner that we hardly notice anymore just...went silent. 

It was around 2:00 we heard the first scream. It was horrible and bloodcurdling, and It came from outside. We could hear it reverberate from the glass window, cold to the touch. As I’d find out later, the first of many screams to come. Some kid had decided to go outside. We didn’t know that yet, though. Mr. Samson had clearly had enough.

“I’m going to check with Ms. Young next door. Stay put. Lock the door behind me. I’ll be back shortly.” Standing from his desk, he took brisk steps to the classroom door, exiting with the confidence only an authority figure has. 

We followed his instructions. For a while, at least. Minutes ticked by. Finally, around 2:30, we decided to just leave. What were they going to do? We’d been left with no guidance. Just a bunch of kids who totally didn’t know better, right? 

It was cold outside as I passed the threshold. You know when you enter a Walmart at midnight, and everything is just...weird? Like you’re on a different plane? That’s kind of what this felt like. The halls were dark. Silent. The only light strewn in through the double doors in hall B, casting large shadows behind doorways. The fog pressed against the door, almost ominously. 

“I’m leaving.” The guy from earlier shrugged, headed towards the doorway.

“What if they turned the alarms on? The doors will sound. Especially if we’re on a lockdown.” Ashley pointed out.

“Powers out. I doubt they are.” He called from behind him. I only looked over at him when I heard the doors open.

Immediately, he began screaming. He jerked away from the door, as if he’d been burned. The air smelled like chlorine and bleach. Maybe a bit of formaldehyde that the zoology class uses during exams. The doors swung shut the second he’d let go, the fog quickly dissipating. Audrey rushed over to him, trying to help.

“What’s a matter? Josh?” She set a hand on his shoulder before jerking her own hand back, letting out a sharp exhale as if she’d been burned. Because she had. She seemed to notice the situation almost instantly, shrinking back from the cowering boy in front of her, now letting out raspy and crackling moans of pain. It reminded me of someone with pneumonia, the sound of it. 

Burning. His skin was burning. Bright red and blistering, and so was the palm of Audrey’s hand.

“It’s a chemical burn.”

“What touched them?”

“There’s a shower in the science lab, we should get them there.”

“How did this happen?”

Thirty voices, all at once. We split up, in the end. Five of them headed to 2-b, the lab with the supposed shower. The rest of us headed into the classroom, half of us eerily quiet, the other chattering in confusion and alarm.

And here we are, folks. A couple hours later, in a classroom surrounded by white. A fog of chemicals. We should find someone who knows what’s going on— we can’t just sit here, can we? And yet, that’s exactly what we’re doing. I’m posting this. You guys seem to know your way out of some...less than ideal situations. I’m at a loss. I’m...scared.

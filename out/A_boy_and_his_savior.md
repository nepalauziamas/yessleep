Some of the boy's earliest memories were of searing pain and thunderous, pouring rain. His family could no longer feed a young child, especially one that couldn't even lift a sack of grain onto the oxcart. Not one that slept in on market days. But it was not his fault - constant hunger and malnutrition had made him weak and narcoleptic. After a particularly restless night, where the shouting and pounding of hands and fists by his parents and eldest siblings kept the boy from reaching a deep slumber, they once again set out for the market. The excursion was not profitable, as had been the case for the past several months. On the journey back, in twilight, they told the boy with hard voices to wait by the tree, but he could see glints of tears in the corners of their eyes. So he waited. 

The being knew no beginning. Ever since time immemorial, they simply were - just as the stars and the ocean. They heard a pitiful sound among the tempest, and assuming the guise of a human woman, went to investigate. There lay a small, fragile-looking human boy, mostly skin and bones. "What ails you, child?" they asked in a voice that cut like the calls of a hundred birds of prey and bore the weight of unfathomable deep sea creatures. "Hungry. Cold." he responded, his tattered rags unable to protect him from the deluge. 

"I can offer you food, shelter, clothing, an education, and a life beyond anything you've ever imagined. But you must pledge yourself to me, and when the time comes, I shall ask for my payment. Do you pledge yourself to me?" Without a moment's hesitation, the boy mumbled "Uhmph, yeah," before everything turned black. 

The man's life was a good one, albeit lonely. Of course, he had Uhm to keep him company - Uhm had been a mother, father, teacher, confidant, friend, and even playmate when he was younger - but Uhm was not enough. He craved the company of other humans. He did get to interact with them from time to time: supply runs into town, aiding lost travelers, when Uhm gave him money to experience the pleasures of flesh (he particularly remembered the care and affection the man and woman at the brothel had given him). But the man yearned for family, for community. As far back as he could recall, it was just him and Uhm, since the stormy night when...

"How are you my child? It seems you were somewhere far away," observed the being.
"Uhm, I love you, and I am so grateful for all that you've provided. You've taught me the language of poetry, you've bought all the books, toys, clothes, and food I've ever desired. You've shown me the arts of warcraft and magic, exposed me to mystical knowledge of extraordinary beings. I will always be thankful," he proclaimed, choking back tears. "But I...I think it's time for me to move on, be with my own kind."

The being always knew this day would come. It always did, no matter the eon, no matter the human. They tried to prolong it - offering money for dalliances in town, providing everything that the humans asked for, and most of all, genuinely loving and caring for them. Countless varied setups but always the same outcome, like a balanced equation. Perhaps this one might end the ennui. The being was not holding their breath, although it did particularly enjoy the growth and company of this once feeble creature. "Perhaps it is so. I did enjoy raising you. Yet, I must ask now for the payment owed," declared Uhm. 

As the words echoed in the study, Uhm, the being he had loved and counted on as far back as he could remember, began to change shape. Although the man had witnessed the being assume different guises in the past, this transformation was different - on a larger scale, more ancient and powerful than any form he had seen before. They manifested undulating, scarlet tentacles lined with razor-sharp teeth across uncountable vertices. Dozens of claws and fangs emerged from the being, like those of dragons, dinosaurs, sharks, and giant eagles. Myriad tawny piercing eyes, like vipers' and wolves', twitched open across limbs with no rhyme or reason, as did orifices oozing with blood, ichor, pus, and rot. Many of the abscesses soon filled with the massive, matte black maws of great beaked Krakens. The deafening chorus of a stampede filled the air. At the same time as the tails of ancient whales and Leviathans took form, several gargantuan serpentine bones emerged from the nexus. The bleached-white collection of writhing angles, ribs, and sharp edges gained flesh, and luminous, dark pointed scales. They absorbed all light around them and glowed like marsh gas. 

The man was transfixed in place. At this point, the study and by extension, the whole estate had been consumed by the being's transformation. The villagers would feel the rumblings, although they were too far to witness the majestic, horrific site. They would definitely receive the full force of the pregnant storm clouds that appeared over the being, though. 

The being released its true form, or at least a composite of creatures and forces of nature it currently identified with. They watched with legion eyes as the man just stood there. As more and more of their form consumed the surrounding land, the being decided it had been long enough. With a powerful lunge that surely caused the earth to quake, Uhm devoured the latest child in one swift gulp, then reconstituted into the more manageable form of a hawk. "Not much of a champion, but he had kindness. Perhaps I shall remember him again in a few millennia," thought the being, eagle eyes dry as it took flight to begin the cycle once again. Deathless, permanent, eternal...at least until the next pledge.

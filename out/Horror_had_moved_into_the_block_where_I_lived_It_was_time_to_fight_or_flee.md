*The Block:* [*https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/urkft8/the\_block/*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/urkft8/the_block/)

Hi-Rise living was the pits.

I had no money, no job and no prospects. My phone was out of credit and the internet was out of reach. The last proper conversation I had had was with my ex-wife – and she hated me.

The highlight of my week was walking miles to the nearest shop and buying a cheap bottle of whisky, then sitting alone in my twentieth floor flat in the tower block where I lived and drinking myself unconscious.

There was one other thing as well, one more problem.

It was a big one. Potentially, the last I would ever face.

And, because of this, I was struggling not to hyperventilate as I sat in my claustrophobic kitchen holding the broken-off chair leg. I had spent all day making it into a wooden stake.

This had seemed like a good idea when I began. As darkness fell outside, I was not so sure.

Sweat began to trickle down my neck and I felt sick.

I took a deep breath, trying to calm myself and stared out of the window.

The tower block in which I lived was surrounded by vast swathes of waste ground. The lights of Glasgow city centre were dull smudges in the distance.

No help would come from there.

The other people who lived in the tower block would not lift a finger either unless they had no choice. They would all stay behind locked doors with their TVs turned up full.

I felt very alone.

I got to my feet and stood looking out into the gloom. The last of the light had trickled away.

It was time.

And sure enough, there was the first one: a dark shape in the sky, its wings moving slowly as it circled the tower block looking for a way in.

The Vampire, in search of fresh prey.

Until yesterday, I had lived in ignorance of creatures such as this. Then I had encountered their blood-soaked feeding frenzies when two of my neighbours were attacked. I escaped by the skin of my teeth.

Afterwards, I had decided not to run away. For once in my miserable life, I would stay and fight.

Clutching my home-made wooden stake as the Vampire came closer and closer to the window, I knew I had made a mistake.

I also really wished I had not drunk all the whisky.

The Vampire's face was a hideous hybrid of man and bat. Its nose was flattened. Its eyes were specks of red, and I knew from the damage I had seen them inflict close-up, that instead of hands and feet it had viciously sharp claws and that its mouth was lined with deadly fangs.

It swooped. Now, it was feet away. Only a thin pane of glass stood between us – and it had seen me.

I had been an idiot. Naïve. Presenting myself as a sitting target, an easy meal.

The Vampire struck the window. The sound of the collision filled the room. I flinched and backed away.

It threw itself against the glass again. Its mouth was open, and it looked to be howling, but I could hear nothing.

What on earth was it doing? I wondered.

Then I realised.

It was calling, using a frequency too high for me to hear.

Telling its evil kin about me.

I abandoned all plans to make a stand and ran for the door out of my apartment. The corridor I fled into was long and narrow and led to a staircase which wound all the way down to the ground floor.

The lift would have been quicker, if it was working. But the thought of being in that constricted space was too much.

I would take my chances with the stairs.

With my heart hammering in my chest, I began to hurtle downwards - taking two steps at once, almost tripping and falling, but somehow staying on my feet.

I glanced at the floor numbers stencilled onto the wall as I turned onto each new wind in the staircase.

I was gasping for breath, and I was only a fraction of the way down.

The lights in the stairwell were broken here. They flickered on and off, bathing me in fractured light as I ran, desperate to escape. I knew that at any moment I could come face to face with a Vampire making its way up the staircase, but there was no other way.

I kept running.

Until finally I burst out into the ground floor lobby. It was a grim space. The lights continued to flicker, and the rank smell of stale urine assaulted my senses.

I hurtled on, through the entrance doors, and outside, where I stood with my hands on my knees panting for breath.

Then someone said, “Good evening.”

Startled, I looked up.

I was in a such a state, I hadn’t noticed there was a woman there. She was standing next to a van parked up in the small, glass-strewn road that faced the entrance.

She was five-foot nothing, with shoulder length dark hair. And she had a loaded crossbow in her hands.

I managed to find my voice and asked, “Who are you?”

She beamed a smile at me and said, “Millie McKenzie, I’m a Vampire Hunter.”

“A what!” I gasped.

“A Vampire Hunter,” she replied. “I used to work in a bank, but I got made redundant when they shut the branch. So, I decided to go into business for myself. No more nine-to-five, no more putting up with stupid managers and even more stupid customers.”

The slim wooden stake loaded into her crossbow looked horribly sharp, like someone had put a lot of frustration and anger into making it.

I smiled nervously as she added: “I scan the skies for them and noticed you have quite the infestation. We just need to agree a fee and I can get cracking.”

I opened my mouth but said nothing. I desperately needed her help, but I couldn’t pay her.

No one who lived round here could.

I was trying desperately to think what to say when a loud crashing sound made us both jump.

Millie whirled round.

A Vampire had landed on the roof of her van. The metal had buckled beneath it.

She swore and aimed her crossbow.

The Vampire raised itself to its full height and once more screamed silently into the night.

A second Vampire descended.

Behind me, I heard the entrance doors banging open, and turned.

Another Vampire was crawling out of the tower block. Its claws scraped along the ground as it moved, a sound that made my skin crawl.

I stood frozen to the spot with fear as the Vampire approached.

I tried to move. I knew my fate was sealed if I stayed where I was, but I was trapped in a waking nightmare, and it was no use.

My limbs were numb, useless.

The Vampire was inches away from me. Its jaws opened with a sickening, cracking sound. I felt its hot, foul breath on my face, and saw its fangs. Spittle joined their razor-sharp tips.

Then something rushed past my cheek – and I watched in shock as a stake pierced the Vampire’s throat.

It reared up and tried to grasp the wooden projectile with its claws. Blood flowed, dark and thick from its wound, and it staggered backwards, but its red eyes still blazed with primal fury.

It was hurt but it was not down.

I felt a hand on my shoulder.

It was Millie. She looked calm and her voice was steady when she said, “Give me some space. I’ll finish it off.”

My legs finally listened to my brain, and I managed to stagger sideways.

Millie aimed, and this time the stake entered the Vampire in-between its ribs. Dead centre where its heart was.

It threw its head back and its wings spread out wide – and then it began to crumble. Its skin and muscles and bones fell away until all that was left was a pile of dust on the ground.

“That’s three Vampires taken out. Not a bad night’s work,” Millie said.

I looked back to where the other two had been.

Two more piles of dust sat in their place.

Millie strolled over to her van and using the crossbow brushed off the remains of the Vampire which littered the roof of her van.

Then she turned to me and said something – but I wasn’t listening.

Out of the corner of my eye I had seen something moving overhead.

Wordlessly, I pointed up into the sky.

Millie looked and simply said, “Oh. I see.”

There was a fourth Vampire circling and, as we both craned our necks, it started to descend.

Fast.

It was hurtling towards us, its claws pointing forwards, its fangs bared.

“In the van,” Millie yelled.

I did not need telling twice and scrambled into the passenger seat. She’d turned the ignition key and the engine kicked into life before I’d even got the door closed.

We sped forwards.

We’d made it, I thought. We were safe.

A shadow passed over the front windscreen and the Vampire flew ahead of us, span round with breath-taking agility, and threw itself forwards.

It was heading straight for us.

I was too terrified to speak, but willed Millie to veer off the road. To pull out of the collision that was coming in moments.

I glanced at her. Her face was set in an expression of grim determination.

And then she smiled – and accelerated.

As we shot towards the Vampire, my life flashed before my eyes.

It wasn’t an impressive sight. If it had been a movie in a cinema, I would have asked for my money back.

At my side Millie pressed a button – and a stake flew out of the front of the van and embedded itself in the Vampire’s chest.

By the time we reached it, all we were passing through was a cloud of dust.

Then the road opened up in front of us and we were speeding through the night.

Alive, and victorious.

I marked the occasion by bursting into tears.

Millie tapped the dashboard and said, “Accessorised. Everyone should have one.” Then she turned a dial and heavy metal music began to blast out.

“So,” she said above the riffs, “I got the feeling from your horrified experience when I mentioned a fee, that you’re broke.”

I grinned sheepishly and replied, “Stony broke. They stopped paying my unemployment benefit.”

“You would work, though, if you had the chance?” she asked.

“Would I ever!” I exclaimed, momentarily drowning out a verse about a ‘rocking party’.

Millie smiled. “Well, I need an assistant. So you can work for me and pay off the fee that way. Deal?”

“Deal,” I agreed and we hi-fived.

For the first time in a long time, my life was looking good, and I couldn’t keep the smile off my face as I watched the world rush by.

We were heading further away from the city, further from the shop windows covered by security grills, and the graffiti covered walls and bridges that looked like someone had vomited paint onto them.

I even opened the window a little and the cool night air felt good on my skin. Before long it started to smell of manure because we were in open countryside.

Still smiling, I wound the window back up. In the driver’s seat, Millie yawned, which set me off and I felt my eyes closing.

It was light by the time I woke up. There was no sign of Millie.

I blinked and rubbed my face. I couldn’t remember the last time I had fallen asleep so easily without a hefty dose of alcohol.

The trouble with booze-induced sleep is that while passing out comes quickly, it’s a shallow, dream-infested slumber with a headache-tinged fog waiting on the other side.

But this, was wonderful. I felt refreshed and clear-headed. I sat up straighter. A pain shooting up my back reminded me that I’d slept slumped in the passenger seat of a van, but it was a small price to pay.

I wiped condensation from the inside of the window and peered out at the new day. At some point Millie must have parked up in a layby. It was ringed by thick green bushes and there was a small rubbish bin on a pole. It was full to the brim and cans and takeaway cartons littered the ground around the base of the pole.

A seagull looking for scraps to eat stopped poking around in the refuse long enough to give me a sideways dirty look when I stepped out of the van.

Millie was heading towards me. The road was narrow, and she skirted the edge. She was my new hero – partly because she had saved me from the Vampires the night before, but more importantly at that moment because she was holding two takeaway coffees and breakfast muffins.

Caffeine and cholesterol heaven.

Millie took her time with her food. I wolfed mine down. She laughed at me when I had finished and was examining the wrapper to see if there were any crumbs left.

“You owe me another two hour’s work to cover the cost of that breakfast,” she said.

There was a wry smile on her face, but I could tell she meant it.

“No problem, boss,” I replied. “What’s on the to-do list today.”

She folded her wrapper neatly into a square before answering, “We’re heading to an estate in the Highlands. The owner has been having problems with some very unpleasant squatters.”

The food suddenly felt heavy in my stomach. “Vampires,” I muttered.

“With a bounty on their heads,” she said, grinning, and started the engine.

We reached the estate hours later and wound our way down a path lined by immaculately tended trees.

Finally, the van crunched to a halt in front of a huge stately home. I had only ever seen buildings like this on TV before and, after the squalor of the tower block, its splendour looked unreal.

This was how the other half lived!

A man wearing a tweed suit descended the stone steps leading from the main entrance door to the house.

“You must be the tradespeople,” he said in a grating upper-class English accent. “I’ll get Wilkins to show you where the beasties are.”

A second figure had appeared on the steps. He was small and hunched over and ancient. His eyebrows dominated his wrinkled face. They were great, grey bushes that almost looked as if they had a life of their own.

“M’ Lord,” he said and made his way slowly down the rest of the steps. He looked at me like I was something he had found on the bottom of his shoes then turned his gaze to Millie.

“If you would like to follow me, Miss, I will take you to the lair.”

“Lead the way,” Millie replied enthusiastically. We followed Wilkins along a path which cut past the side of the house and found ourselves standing in a vast garden which overlooked a lake.

The gardens were immaculate. There was not a leaf out of place.

The lake was another matter.

The water appeared dark and still. Wilkins led us closer, and I saw that the surface of the lake was thick with rotting vegetation. There was a nauseating smell drifting from it as well.

I covered my nose and mouth with my hand, and I could tell even Millie was struggling to not show her distaste at this foul body of water.

Wilkins was clearly made of a finer vintage than either of us, and looked and sounded entirely unruffled when he said, “It began six weeks ago when livestock from the estate started going missing overnight. His Lordship suspected poachers and ordered the gamekeepers to patrol the estate after dusk. They too went missing. Security guards were brought in, dozens of them, but they suffered the same fate.

“All except for one man. We found him hiding in a bush at dawn raving about flying monsters swooping down from the sky and attacking everyone. According to him, they carried the other security guards into the lake, pulled them under still struggling and screaming and never saw them again.”

He paused in his tale and looked out over the fetid water before adding, “It is all rather unpleasant, and his Lordship would like you to deal with it.”

He turned to Millie and raised one of his epically messy eyebrows quizzically as he said, “Can you do that?”

Millie took a deep breath, then nodded.

Wilkin’s eyebrow returned to its resting position, and he left us to it.

We returned to the van so Millie could get her crossbow and stakes. I wasn’t allowed a weapon yet so carried spare ammunition.

“Have you ever heard of water dwelling Vampires before?” I asked as we set off back towards the lake.

Millie frowned. “No, but that does not change the nature of the beast. On land or in the sky or in water, they’re creatures who fear nothing while they have the cover of darkness. But the simple light of day is fatal to them. Sunlight, and one of these striking in the right place.” She patted the wooden stake she had just loaded into her crossbow.

I could only hope she was right.

We had reached the edge of the lake. The last of the shadows were merging as dusk fell.

Millie stood holding her crossbow, waiting it seemed.

“Do we need bait?” I whispered. “A sheep or a cow or something?”

She looked me in the eye and said, “We are the bait.”

I started to shake.

The dark lake filled my vision. Time seemed to slow. The night ahead was filled with the promise of menace.

And I did not need to wait long. There was a ripple in the lake, movement among the decaying vegetation, then a horribly familiar creature emerged at speed.

To my eyes, all Vampires shared one physical characteristic:

They were spectacularly repulsive.

The Vampire that rose into the air in front of us was no exception. It was part human, part bat, and all freak.

A stake sped towards it, moving too quickly for my eyes to register the loosed projectile as more than a blur.

Millie’s aim was once more impeccable, and dust started to fall back onto the lake – just as a second Vampire broke through the surface.

It flew through the remains of its kin and made it thirty feet into the air before Millie ended its miserable existence.

I watched the shower of Vampire dust, entranced, until my eyes were drawn to something new in the lake.

A pair of red eyes stared out. This Vampire was only exposed up to its neck.

I did not know if Millie had seen it and did not have chance to tell her because two more Vampires had exploded out of the lake. They spiralled high, twisting and turning as they went.

Millie was following their progress with her reloaded crossbow. She could only take out one at once and both were presenting incredibly hard targets, but my money was still on Millie.

Then the Vampire that had been waiting in the lake finally rose out of the water. It was moving more slowly and it had something clutched in the claws on its legs.

I realised with horror that it was carrying a human skull – and moving towards Millie.

Its claws swung and it threw the skull at her.

All her attention was still on the pair of Vampires above her and she had not noticed the missile made of bone that was about to hit her.

I threw myself forwards, colliding with her and knocking her to the ground. The skull missed her by inches – but not me.

It caught me hard on the side of my head and pain flooded through me. Everything went dark.

I came round to the sight of a blurred face.

It was a woman. Leaning over me. Concern lined her face. She was asking me if I was OK.

She was so beautiful.

A vision.

I smiled at her.

Millie McKenzie patted me on the cheek and said, “Unlike the Vampires, you’ll live.”

I kept smiling. I was in such a happy daze.

It might have been love, but it was more likely concussion.

All part of a night’s work for a Vampire Hunter’s assistant.

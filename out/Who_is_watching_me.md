Let's begin. One night, I was walking to the mailbox with my fierce guard dog, Gigi (a frenchie). I was thinking of some spooky stories i've heard on youtube, the usual creepypasta, when i heard a rustling coming from a nearby bush. On my street, there is one abandoned house at the other end of where my mailbox is, and theres a path halfway between my house and my mailbox that leads out into a sagebrush field. I was at the trail, and a bush that was on no one's property started moving furiously. I suspected a bunny or squirrel, they're common around here. Thinking nothing of it, I kept walking. All the way to my mailbox (env. 10 houses down).

I got my mail, turned around, and as my eyes continued to adjust to the growing darkness around me, I could have sworn that i saw a tall shadow. There are quite a few trees, especially tall ones, in my area, so again I thought nothing of it and kept walking. My dog suddenly stopped, as if afraid to continue ahead. I was looking down at her, and as I looked up, I saw a huge, seven foot tall apparition staring at my dog with a look of hunger. I gasped, and it's gaze quickly switched to me. As if it were a breeze, the shadow came flying at me with enormous speed. I squeezed my eyes shut, my dog was going crazy, and I thought I was going to die. But, I felt the air grow warm, almost as if an otherworldly presence staved off this demonic entity.

Skip ahead about two weeks, I hadn't been able to sleep since the strange incident on the street. I kept trying to figure out what it was that attacked me, and what saved me, if anything. I felt like it was always watching me. It stalked, but it was almost as if that was as close as it could get. As if something was keeping it at bay. I've done my research, nothing could point out as to what it was that tried to hurt me. Or save me. I've come to the conclusion that i was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. I've disturbed the peace of an unholy being, and in return it is trying to kill me. I believe that my faith in religion is what saved me, not necessarily a being.

Ever since that one unholy night, I've had terrible things happen. It started off small: a bird dead on the sidewalk to my house, my dog getting sick. Then it started to escalate. I fell out of bed, something I haven't done since I was 10 years old. Or, I got so sick that I had to stay overnight in a hospital. Now I fear that it's coming after my family. My mother just fell down the stairs last week, she broke her ankle. She told me that it felt like someone grabbed her foot right as she was about to step. I've had bruises turn up on my arms, places I would never accidentally bruise myself without noticing.

As i write this, I can see it watching through my window. It knows that i'm telling the world about it. I don't know if by posting this i'm breaking my protection, but I do know that if it eventually gets to me, I won't survive. Does anyone know protection spells? I've put salt around my bed, i've saged my doors and windows, and i've used crystals to ward it off, but it seems much too strong to be held off by such elementary spells. If anyone knows what it is, please let me know. I'll keep doing my research, but suggestions are more than appreciated.

**Log One, 6/24**

Hey. I’m \[xxxx xxxxx\], but you can call me NR. I’m from a small town in \[xxxx\], and I run a paranormal investigations youtube channel with my friend, James (using only his first name, for privacy). Today, hee and I got a call to check out this entire abandoned *town.* It’s called Sasbol Heights, and apparently it’s filled to the BRIM with ghosts. Which is good for us, because we can capitalize off of that. 

See, James and I *know* there’s no such thing as ghosts. But a lot of people still believe in that, so we found an opportunity for money. And, hey, that might be a *little* morally questionable, but as long as no one finds these tapes, we’ll be good. Unless we get killed by some crazies and the tapes help with evidence or something. Hell, what am I talking about? We’ll be fine. Anyway, James is driving us to the place right now. I recently got this new camera that’s like..Way better than my last one, so let’s hope that gets us more money or something. 

Oh- There it is. Sorry, gotta turn this thing off- NR out.

**Log Two, 6/25**

The first night was pretty underwhelming. Just some creepy old town with a bunch of bugs and abandoned houses. Nothing too special, just a bigger version of an abandoned house, essentially. 

James said something about nightmares, but he’s always been scared of this stuff, so I think we’ll be fine. Again, ghosts aren’t real, but we can use James’ nightmares for footage and stuff. Stuff like that makes it more believable, from my experience. Or, at least, it gets us more views. 

Today I started setting up the recording equipment. Some mics, ghost hunter prop thingies (like those EMF gauge, fake thermal camera, the works), and I recorded some spooky noises to play once we wanted to make the ghost “appear”. I also made up a little story for it. Again, to make it more believable. 

It’s gonna be a little three-year-old boy who died after a fire erupted in this very town. And now he’s out to kill anyone who trespasses into his town, just in case they’re the arsonist, back for more murder.

Hah! Yeah. That’s believable. The people who watch this are gonna believe this, without a doubt. Well, that’s all I had to say for today. NR out.

&#x200B;

**Log Three, 6/27**

James had another nightmare last night, which isn't too abnormal for him. Though, he said it was..Pretty vivid. Which, again, is normal, I guess?? Not too different. He forgot about it within the hour, so I’m not too concerned.

Today we started recording, saying that we just got here, and this is our first day. We spouted off some rubbish about being scared and hearing weird noises, and, pardon my language, but James is damn good at acting. I mean, he was believable before, but wow! This time, he seemed like..Terrified! Hah! We’re gonna get LOTS of money now.

I’ve already laid out how the next couple of scenes are gonna go, and it’s gonna be around a 30-minute episode. Not my longest one, but, eh, it’s a good length to include as many ads as we can reasonably add, without boring the audience too much. It’s a win-win scenario.

On a side note, I’ve noticed James is a bit more jumpy than usual today. Getting scared at little noises, and flinching at any sudden movements. I’ll look into it later.

For now, I’m tired. NR out.

&#x200B;

**Log Four, 6/28**

So, today we were gonna finish recording, but guess what happened?? The footage got corrupted. Messed up the entire video, it was barely watchable. So, I have to delete the WHOLE thing and start over. It’s a bit irritating for me, but James is more worried about it than I am, for sure. When I told him we have to stay a bit longer, he stayed quiet and nodded. But I’m pretty sure I can hear him crying from the other room right now.

I’m a bit freaked, but it’s alright. Again, he gets scared easily. Though he’s never really gotten *this* spooked over anything..It’ll be fine. We’ll be fine.

On a side note, I’ve been noticing a couple weird things going on lately. Equipment disappearing and reappearing, seeing things out of the corner of my eye, all that stuff. I think it’s just the atmosphere of this place messing with me. Or maybe it’s chemicals, or something? I’m not sure.

I’ll update this tomorrow. NR out.

**Log Five, 6/29**

Today, me and James decided to take a break. For his sake,y’know?? So, we didn’t do much in terms of recording. Instead, though, we explored. And boy, there was a *lot* to see. 

No corpses, thankfully, but a *lot* of bugs, rats, stuff like that. All of which managed to freak out James a little. It was pretty funny, yeah. Heheh. We *did* see a couple things that freaked *me* out a little. 

For example, there was..A lot of ash. Just kind of..Everywhere. We checked out the house where the most of the ash was, and we found something. A little teddy bear, perfectly pristine amidst all the chaos. At this point, James was freaking out, but I calmed him down. I mean, maybe this place isn’t abandoned. If that’s the case, though, then we might have to get filming finished quicker than I thought. We might get arrested or something, and I would prefer not to.

But, look on the bright side! Now we have an actual kind of scary thing to put in the video. But I can’t help but think, you know?? What if we aren’t alone here?? What if there are like, crazy people here?? Or even-..Nah. Ghosts aren’t real. 

Well, I’m tired. NR out.

&#x200B;

**Log Six, 6/30**

Today we started filming again, and everything went smoothly. We’ve got the whole video done with no distortions, nothing like that. But there were a few things I was kinda concerned about.

James is acting a little more jumpy than usual, downright terrified of just..Being in this place. The guy’s mortified at almost every little sound, sudden movement, whatever. Anything he doesn’t expect, he’s horrified. 

And then there was a little interruption while filming.

Everything was going normal. I had the spirit box out, and was asking random questions. “Who are you?” and “Where do you come from??”, all that stuff. It was producing no sound, as expected. It was just a prop, after all. I meant to edit in some weird distorted voice later. Anyway, I was asking questions, and suddenly James tugs on my sleeve and goes “Dude- Dude. The box.”

I looked down at the box, and saw that the numbers on that small little screen were..Distorted. I could barely make out that there were any numbers at all. I had to squint my eyes, and the only numbers I could see were just a bunch of “3”, repeated over and over and over. 

I turned off the box and looked over to see James, sweating like a sinner in church. I was quick to tell him that it was just some prank easter egg or something, but even then, I’m still thinking about it.

Maybe it wasn’t. Maybe it was something else. But it can’t be. Ghosts aren’t real, and I firmly believe that.

Oh, well. I’m tired. NR out.

&#x200B;

**Log Seven, 7/01**

Today was weird. We finished filming and editing, and we were about to go back home when something happened. 

James was getting in the car, but I noticed something. The tires were flat. I grabbed James by the arm and stopped him to point out the tires, and I could see the panic on his face. He instantly got to asking “Well, we can fix it, right?” and stuff like that, to which I shrugged and said “I don’t know. We might need a tow-truck or something.”

At that, James blew up. He started yelling at me, saying how it’s my fault that we’re stuck here, and that he “Never wants to spend another minute in this wretched place!” I-..I tried to calm him down, I really did, but he just kept going.

And it made me think a little. Maybe I *am* the reason we’re stuck. I’m the one who wanted to take a break day- Maybe, if I hadn’t taken that break day, we would have gotten home before our tires were slashed. 

It’s late now, so I’m gonna apologize to James tomorrow, and maybe call a tow place or something.

NR out.

&#x200B;

**Log Eight, 7/02**

Pardon my language, but this is fucking weird.

Last night, I woke up and heard James screaming, somewhere in the house. I was scared for a minute, but brushed it off and went back to bed. James normally has nightmares, so I wasn’t too concerned. I had no reason to be concerned, right??

So, I woke up this morning and went to go apologize to James, and he wasn’t in his sleeping bag. So, I left the house, walked around for a bit, and found him in the cemetery, just..Standing there.

So I walked up to him and tried to ask him about what happened, and he said he..Doesn’t remember. At all. And he had this weird smile on his face when he said it, too. Like..I don’t know, it was just..Off. Y’know?? Like- It almost didn’t seem human, in a way. It was too weird. And his eyes were too big, and his arms were too long, and none of it felt normal at *all,* and–

I..Shouldn’t be worried about this, right? It’s fine. It’s fine. It’s just..Maybe there’s something like-..Chemicals, in the air?? Something like that. Ghosts aren’t real, no matter how much of a weird coincidence this is. No matter how much it seems like there’s no other explanation.

Ghosts. Aren’t. Real.

&#x200B;

**Log Nine, 7/03**

Today was good. I managed to find just what we needed to pump air into the tire and get the hell out of this place. I’ll admit, even *I* was starting to get creeped out. Especially with how James was acting.

I told him the news, and he didn’t seem too phased. In fact, I wonder if he was listening at *all.* He simply turned to me, nodded, and went back to whatever he was doing. When I asked if he was happy to leave, he said a simple “Yeah, sure.”

I’m confused, honestly. He seemed terrified to stay here- Terrified of even *being* here. And now he’s just..Fine?? Just like that, he’s okay with being here. It isn’t *right.* It doesn’t feel like the James I know. 

Maybe..Maybe that *isn’t* the James I know. 

I need a break. NR out.

&#x200B;

**HELP**

This is officially a cry for help. Anyone who listens to these, or finds these, or whatever, please help me.

Today, up until around two hours ago, was normal. Everything was going well. Me and James were getting ready to leave, everything was going fine. It was all going as we planned. We got the equipment and everything else packed up to go in the car, and I was about to leave the abandoned house when I felt James grab my shoulder.

“Hey..” He had said, with an iron grip on my shoulder. “Why don’t we just..Stay here? We have everything we need here. We don’t need to go back, right??”

I turned to face him, barely managing to let out a “W..What??”

“Yeah! We can just..Stay here. We have free shelter, free privacy..No need to leave. An entire town to ourselves, Nick.” James said, grip tightening as he let a larger than normal smile etch across his face. My breath hitched. “Wouldn’t that be nice??”

I pried James’ hand off of me. “Are you fucking insane? Didn’t you want to leave like, 3 days ago??” I said.

“I did..?” James questioned, wrapping his hand around my wrist. His skin felt like static. “I don’t recall.”

“Mate, this isn’t fucking funny.” I spat, tugging my hand away from him. But his grip was too strong. I couldn’t get away from him.

“I’m not trying to be funny, Nick.” James said. “We should stay. Here. Forever. Never leave. Wouldn’t that be nice, Robin??”

“You-You’re not James.” I blurted out, and my eyes widened in horror as James- No, that *thing,* started to change. Its face turned inky black, with only white rings of eyes being visible through the darkness, along with a shiny set of teeth, smiling at me.

“I don’t see what you mean, Nick.” It said, mimicking James’ voice as it had been for however long it was in James’ form. “It’s me. Your dear old pal, ***J̸̘̜̏J̶̘̒̒J̵͈̔J̸̡͊̒J̵̹͠J̶̬̎̈́J̴̙̮̓J̸̩͖̇J̷̙̇͊ͅa̵͓͖̒m̶̩̽̓e̵͖̼͛̎s̴̛̪͎͆.̶̟̠͛̿***.” 

I tugged my hand back, finally breaking the iron grip of the creature in front of me. “Get the fuck away from me!” I said. “Don’t fucking touch me, you- You fucking freak!”

The thing began to advance, walking closer to me. I backed away slowly at first, before turning and breaking into a sprint, all the while I could hear that *thing’s* voice calling out to me, in a cruel mockery of my best friend- No. In a mockery of *James.* James, who I grew up with. James, who I went to college with-..James. The one who begged me not to go on this damn trip.

James, who’s now, most likely a corpse.

I finally made it to my car after running for what seemed like an eternity, slamming the door and speeding the hell out of there as fast as I could.

So, here I am now. Speeding down the road, in the middle of nowhere, and around 3 hours away from my house. You-..You must think I’m crazy. But I’m not. I’m not fucking crazy- All this shit really happened. I have my camera right here to prove i-..

No. No, no, no, no, no–

There’s- It’s-..The thing’s face. It’s right there.

On- On the screen of my camera. It’s right. There. It’s just..Staring at me.

Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

If there is a god..Please. Help me.

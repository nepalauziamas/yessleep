This situation got way out of control. It was out of control from the beginning, even. Too much has happened for me to think about anything else. I can't even process half of what happened. Trying to make sense of it only breaks my conscious mind.


At 10 AM, we were doing our usual business. Organizing papers, answering to a potential threat in Aurora, keeping track of those in the holding cells, etc. At 11, it was announced the station was going into lockdown, that one of our senior officers, Officer Carson, had gone missing, and that some warning should've been taken seriously. He wasn't very specific about what the warning was. I wasn't sure what to expect.


Anyway, I didn't assume anything and got prepared for anything as per usual. I didn't expect what happened next to happen one bit. As I sat there, a scream echoed from down the hall, then all hell broke loose. A series of loud gunshots echoed from the same area. The average police officer only gets close to having to use their gun outside the training room. Right then, it sounded like everybody was using their guns.


The gunshot bangs lasted about 10 seconds. Four scattered bangs followed over the following 20 seconds. I checked my radio. It was static. A minute later, I checked my radio again. Someone was speaking. I couldn't make out what they were saying. It almost sounded like it was a reversed speech.


I stepped out of the room and peeked down the hallway. Nobody was in sight. I stepped down the hallway, gun drawn. As I moved towards the next corner, something tiny and white flew into the hallway. It bounced off the wall and rolled towards me. I bent down to get a closer look. At first, I thought it was a rock. On close inspection, I found out what it really was. A bone. Not an entire bone, just a fragment of one. A pit formed in my stomach. Who threw it? How… did they get it? I wondered.


"Reveal yourself," I said.


I stepped further down the hallway, gun still drawn. Once I reached the corner, I poked around. Officer Baxter was sitting a few meters away from me. He jumped and made eye contact with me. He was as pale as the moon and was shaking. It looked like he was ready to move but was hesitating to. All while drenched in sweat. He shushed me. I needed to ask what was going on, but he couldn't tell me.


He pulled his phone out of his pocket and pushed it towards me. As he did so it looked as though he could only move his hand and lower arm. He was also sitting at best a few meters away from the hallway I was in. That made me wonder how he would have thrown the fragment. He couldn't have. Chills ran down my spine.


I walked up to his phone and picked it up off the ground. On his phone was a paused video. The part it was paused at showed there was a grey mist in front of the camera. I didn't look quite like smoke. I hit play. The video was shaky. The entire area was filled with the grey mist. I turned the volume up. What I heard won't be leaving my head anytime soon. Echoing chilling animalistic painful screams where all that was heard in the video. I turned the volume down. A silhouette of a maybe 7 foot tall person appeared in the mist, walking by from the camera's right to the camera's left.


Another silhouette formed. It moved to the side, stumbled forward and fell to the ground. His head poking out of the mist. Face towards the camera. I probably won't get what I saw out of my head. His face was mangled beyond recognition. There were a few more holes than there should've been. I jumped. There were a dozen tiny dark insects in his hair. They were shaped like nothing I have ever seen before.


What happened to him? I wondered. I had never seen such a condition before. I was so shocked by it, it took me a second to notice the silhouette of the 7 foot person was no longer visible. The video ended.


I gave Baxter his phone back. After he slid it back into his pocket, he jumped and began to stare at the wall across from him. I looked at the approximate spot he was staring at. It was empty.


I wanted to get to the lobby, so I continued my trek down the hallway. As I continued to move, I noticed Officer Baxter was ahead of me. I had walked away from him, so that didn't make any sense. I turned around and walked back. After I got some way down the hallway, I was once again approaching Officer Baxter, along with the bulletin board above his head. I was stumped. I thought I was walking down the hallway without an issue. I couldn't recall turning around to walk back the way I came, or thinking into space. I was alert the whole time. I continued walking.


I turned the corner, then I creeped down the hall. At one point, I passed the door to the surveillance room. Then I passed it again. I walked back the other way, only to arrive at the surveillance room once more. I scratched my head. It being my only choice, I went into the surveillance room. I decided to take a look at different camera footage to see if anything was going on elsewhere in the building.


Hallway 1: The Officer Baxter was still sitting there in that spot. Tears ran down his face while giving a thousand yard stare.


Hallway 2: Another officer, Officer Jenkins, was pacing erratically, jolting around almost aimlessly. Similar looking insects to the ones on that person's head earlier were sitting on Jenkins' head as well.


Hallway 3: Everything looked normal at first, but then the wall across from the camera looked like it was drawn. It was unusual, as I walked down that hallway everyday. It never looked so fake before. The bottom of the wall began to ripple. I swear an eye opened up on the ground, then it blinked right before the video cut off.


Lobby: The video was fuzzy, but I could make out a few things. A dozen bodies. All with mangled faces. Laying on the ground. Some were moving. One twitched in a way too erratic for a human. One stared up at the camera. Snapped human bones laid all over. A person in a cloak walked through the lobby. Wires protruded out from where his face should be. His hands were rotted. They were zombie-like. What was happening there? I wondered. What was happening anywhere? The sight made me cold.


I backed away from the screens. Before I looked away, the view changed to the surveillance room. I saw myself standing in the middle of the room. I was paler than I'd assume I was. Another officer entered the room. But it was only in the video. No one had entered the room in reality. Confused, I stepped closer to the screens. The officer who entered had a mangled face. He took a knife out and stabbed me. In the video that is. It wasn't happening to me in real life. The video version of me fell to the ground. I almost gagged watching the footage.


The footage changed to footage of my own living room, which was odd. The station wasn't a mass surveillance center. There was no way that footage should've been there. And I know it was my living room because of the family portraits. Anyway… A man with black hair was sitting on the couch. His facial structure and hair were very similar to mine. He jumped out of his seat. Another man, one about as tall with brown hair, walked up to him, pointing a gun at his face. It wasn't long before the man with brown hair shot him. After being shot, he tumbled backwards onto the couch.


The footage changed to another video that took place in my living room. But from an angle similar to a person's view. A man with black hair and glasses who looked to be in his 20s walked into the room. He walked up to the camera, stopping not far away from it. He put his hands on his hips, then he squinted his eyes. The camera flew backwards for a couple seconds, then the footage shook and distorted for a second. A hand waved in front of the camera. The setting suddenly changed to a spacious looking dark grey void. Lighter grey mist inhabited the void. It grew, shrunk, and transformed like clouds. It did so at a pace that made the video look sped up.


As the mist transformed, there were split seconds where hellish looking beings popped up in front of the camera. They had dark metallic looking bodies with tentacle-like limbs. Though I caught just a glimpse of each, thinking about them felt like I was setting my conscious on fire. I forced myself to think about something else while keeping my attention on the video.


At one point, one thing that wasn't a hellish being popped up. It was a woman with black hair. She stared at the camera. It looked like she was doing a few other things as well, but the video was going too fast to capture them. Anything she did registered as a quarter of a second in length in the video. Her stare became unsettling real quick from my view as I watched, even though it went on for at most five seconds. Then she vanished.


A second after she vanished, an orange mist popped up in her place. It looked like both a mist and a bunch of flames at the same time. I don't really want to explain the rest. Dread hit me hard the first second of its part. It was there for at most 10 seconds, then it vanished. The grey void once again became the main view.


Some seconds after the grey void became the main view again, the camera was back in the living room. The room looked quite different. The TV looked thin enough to fit into a crack and the lamps were replaced with doughnut shaped lamps. The camera fell sideways, hitting the ground. A hand landed in front of it. The hand was wrinkled. A finger was missing and the stub looked infected beyond belief. All the hairs on the hand were white. His hand looked decades older all of a sudden. The image began to blur.


I decided to rewind the video and slow it down. I didn't see anything more than I already saw, meaning the events really did unfold that quickly. Yet somehow, the person had aged and got an infection. The only way I could make sense of it is if decades had passed for the person, while a minute had gone by for me. But how? I wondered. Just the idea of that sent chills down my spine. It was just a theory though.


Why were these videos playing? I wondered. Why did most of them involve me dying? My stomach hadn't felt so low before. I was close to gagging. I tried to turn it off, but it continued to play. I tried to get the tape out, but it wouldn't budge.


After failing to stop the videos, I tried to exit the room. The doorknob wouldn't budge, however. Like it wasn't real. I decided to keep my eyes off the screen. I glanced at the screens every minute or so to check if the videos were still going. Each time I checked… they were still going.


I decided to pass the time by looking through the footage bin. While sifting through the tapes, I found a DVD case with no cover and a blank CD inside. The CD had Officer Carson's full name on it. It was dated July 26th. I was curious as to what it was doing there. It wasn't a tape like the others were. As I held it, a loud boom echoed from down the hall. As I put the CD case down, another booming noise made me jump. The CD case flew out of my hands and fell behind the footage bin.

The rest is fuzzy. I remember sitting up against the tape box, exhausted, then a loud disorienting bang happened to my left. The next thing I remember is that I was sitting up against the wall in the bathroom. I checked my phone. The time was 3 AM. As I slid my phone into my pocket, gunshots and chilling shrieks came from outside. My heart sped up.


When I exited the bathroom, I was met with a wall of grey mist. It was unknown as far as I knew. I knew I had no idea what was in it. By the time I realized that, I had already inhaled it. I began to cough like crazy. I backed up into the bathroom. A burning sensation shot up through me. Somehow, I had the urge to go back out into the mist, but I fought it. I sat up against the wall and typed out the rest of this thing.


It's 3:53 AM, Thursday as of this sentence. There's no way any of that stuff was normal. Whenever I get out of this station, I will get this out.

Okay… I thought it was over. But apparently, it's not. I can't talk about what happened, but what was referred to as the main situation was taken care of. The entire situation is still ongoing, however. Another disturbance can occur at any time. Those higher up than the police will take care of it now that they know it can happen in York Region too. We can talk about it and sound crazy, just as long as we don't try to make a big fuss about it. This isn't allowed to be on the news at all. All of that is what I was told.


It was too weird. Too abnormal. Also, something definitely has it out for me going by those videos. I need a break. A long one. Maybe some of you can help me grasp this type of thing better. This is the first time anything like this has happened to me.

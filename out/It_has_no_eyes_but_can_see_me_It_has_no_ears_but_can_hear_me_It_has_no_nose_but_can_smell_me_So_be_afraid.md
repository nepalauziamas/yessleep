This story isn’t about me, its about… him. I don’t know who he is, other than the fact that he is a young male, probably in his early 20’s. I couldn’t figure out who the phone seem to have belonged to, and honestly it look like it had been wiped. What was more eerie was that it had no password and opening the phone went straight to the voice memos, as if that was the last thing used on the phone before…

Something.

But, really, there is no introduction to the horrors I’m about to transcribe. His words, his experiences, can and will stand on their own. 

I just hope this warning will be taken seriously. I’m taking it to the police tomorrow.

\*\*\*

(what I assume is rustling as the phone is being handled and prepped to record)

(gravelly voice, distant)

Hey?

(getting closer and more into focus, he speaks quietly)

Hey? Hey?

(he faintly chuckles) I hope this is recording.

Long story short, for whoever is listening to this, I went out to take a piss in the woods, and it’s like (he pauses for a bit, crunching of leaves and things can be heard as he moves around) 3 a.m. and my dumbass got myself lost. I swear I didn’t even go that far from the campsite, but I recognize nothing around me and all I have is my phone’s flashlight to guide me.

Anyways, I need to get back to the site. Yvonne begged me not to leave because she was afraid of something. Not sure what it was but I told her that unless she wanted me to pee on her- (he laughs a bit to himself, softly) she’s not *that* kinky- that I was going out to do my business. Besides she had Matt and Jessica still at the site, one tent over.

I believe it had something to do with rustling in the woods? Like, c’mon its the fucking woods, animals live here. Deal with it. But she kept on rambling about how it can tell that she was scared. I have no idea what she means by that, but I did hear some rustling while I was doing my thing. It’s probably just a deer. I wasn’t too freaked out cuz I wasn’t really sobered up from the night before, and this is where I realize I’m lost.

I’m still probably not that sober (he does slur a little speech but not too much) and I’m blaming the god-damn old bay vodka for getting me lost… shit was disgusting and not worth 30 dollars to drink spiked crab-flavored sprite. 

But who knows, maybe this little recording will tell *you*, Yvonne, that there’s nothing to be afraid of with a little bit of Russian liquor in your system (he begins to laugh again, and I can hear something moving in the recording).

See? There it is again! I bet it’s a deer.

FUCK OFF DEER! (he practically screams this part out, all noises from movement stops, the forrest sounds… too quiet)

(he laughs again, loudly, and its obvious he’s still drunk at this point) 

(he settles down)

Fuck, where am I? I’m looking around and really don’t know where anything is, I swear I didn’t really-

(a very loud scream could be heard in a little distance from the phone. I often have to stop the recording at this point, I can’t shake the awful feeling that scream of terror gives me, but for you guys, I will continue)

Yvonne? (a tinge of fear can be heard in his voice, but it disappears just as quickly as it showed up)

…or a fox?

Anyways maybe the campsite is that way.

(another scream follows, sounds like the same person. or maybe it really is just a fox like he said. he doesn’t speak and just keeps moving toward the noise)

(this time, it’s a different person’s cry, this one sounding more masculine, and brief chaos and commotion can be heard coming from multiple sources to where he is heading. he doesn’t say anything until all of the sounds end abruptly in what I can only describe as a wet crunch)

That’s one gnarly fox (what).

(he goes silent for a bit, and then it sounds like he stumbled across the site)

What… 

What the hell?! (he sounds incredibly angry and upset, but not afraid)

What the hell happened to our campsite?! Everything is fucking tossed everywhere, god, god, what the fuck? What…

(another scream, sounding almost identical to the one before, so shrill and so terrifying with fear oozing out of it, can be heard right near the phone)

Yvonne?

Fuck that was her.

Yvonne!

Yvonne are you okay! What the hell happened to the campsite? Is Matt and Jessica alright? Should we call-

(he stops suddenly. he stops moving. only silence can be heard)

(he drops his voice to a whisper)

That’s not fucking her.

Oh my god, what the hell was that? That, that *thing* (thing?), it didn’t have a-

Oh god! It didn’t fucking have a face! I think it was crouched over Matt, Matt-

Matt, he didn’t have a mouth! I swear to god it looked like it was ripped from his face leaving a gaping hole where it should have been, and his throat was completely ripped off. As soon as I saw that, I felt unimaginable fear and then the thing looked at me! As if on fucking cue! Holy shit holy shit.

Like I said, it doesn’t have a face. It’s ridiculously tall, probably ten feet and lanky, with a fleshy skin only covering bones. The skin looks like that of a burn victim, with a sinewy and webbed texture. Fuck looking at it makes me want to vomit.

It only had mouth. No ears, no eyes, no nose… nothing that can sense me. At least that made me calm down (and probably the liquor coursing through his veins) but oh my fucking god! That mouth! How can I describe it…

(rustling can be as he turns and runs, leaving that sound of a wet crunching that I described earlier, maybe it’s eating? behind him as he gets away. he continues)

It looked like it was filled with dozens of different human canines, jaggedly aligning the entire mouth and down its mouth, with unnaturally long tongues snaking out of it’s throat that looked like ten or so people’s tongues molded together in the worse of ways. Oh god…

I made it back to the tent.

Yvonne! (he harshly screams, but still in a whisper. the sound of a zipper can be heard)

Yvonne! We got to get out of here! You were right, someth-

(retching can be heard, and then crying)

No! No no no no no… Yvonne? What happened to you! Oh Yvonne, fuck-

(a loud snap is heard)

It’s here. (he whispers)

(another snap)

How did it find me? That thing can’t have any senses! For God’s sake it didn’t have a face!

I want to run, but I can’t. I don’t even know what to feel, grief or fear, and honestly I feel nothing and I am paralyzed here. What can I do? Oh Yvonne, what happened to you…

(a deafening scream that almost destroyed the phone’s mic pierces through at this point, and loud clambering noise tells that he has turned out of the tent and begins to run, fear filling his voice as he does so. the snapping of nature under something massive shows that the thing is now chasing him)

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

(fear fear fear)

(gaining gaining gaining)

Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

(more fear more fear more fear)

(closer closer closer)

FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!

(terror terror terror)

(near him behind him-)

(a scream. his scream. a wet crunch)

(silence)

\*\*\*

I have to stop the recording here. Every time. I can’t listen to the last part, because every time I do it fills me with terror. The same terror he must have felt. And when I feel that terror, I feel it coming closer, and I know why.

It has no eyes but can see me.

It has no ears but can hear me.

It has no nose but can smell me.

\*\*\*

(in his voice, distorted, labored)

I have no senses but can feel your fear…

So be afraid.

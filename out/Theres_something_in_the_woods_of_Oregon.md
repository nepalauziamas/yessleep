Me (45 M) have been living in Oregon for my whole life, recently I was looking over some pictures in my fathers room since he had just passed away. There were many picture books but one in particular caught my eye, a big blue book with the title “My name child hood memories” So obviously I looked through and saw a picture of me and my old dog Buck. I had totally forgotten about buck he was my first and last ever dog he was a golden retriever with the biggest eyes ever. As I looked through the book I remembered what has happened 30ish years ago, 

I was 12 at the time and buck was around 5 years old, I did everything with buck considering I was a loner and literally had no friends. One day after school I was walking home through the thick woods and found a tin Batman lunch pale I was young and wanted to see what was inside of the lunch pale so I opened the little hatches and inside I found a walkie talkie, I didn’t think anything of it since I was young and so I took it home with me. 

Fast forward to the night after I found the talkie I was playing with my green plastic army soldiers and herd a weird sound, not knowing where it came from I was startled, it sounded like someone talking but static and very deep. I was trying to figure out where it was coming from and I remembered the talkie that I had found, I grabbed the talkie from under my bed and put it close to my ear and heard the talking coming from the walkie. I tried to talk back into it but the voice would just ignore me when I tried talking to it, So I just put it back under my bed and went to sleep. Then at around like 2am I woke up to the noise but this time it was so loud that it hurt my ears, I tried muting the talkie but it didn’t get any quieter, I realized the noise was coming from outside. I was scared but pushed myself to open the window and when I did I saw the most horrifying thing any man could see, a skeleton like being about 15 feet tall staring into my window with the walkie talkie in its hand. I shut the blinds as fast as possible and hid under my bed sheets, I was so scared but eventually fell back asleep.

When I woke up the next morning I thought it was all just a dream so I forgot about It eventually. Since it was the 1980s I didn’t have any electronics like kids nowadays, I did the only thing I could do and I went into the woods to explore with Buck, all I did was walk around finding cool rocks and trees for hours until eventually it got dark enough to where I couldn’t really see anything anymore so I started to walk home, as I was walking home I heard something almost like a deep static talking, I froze in place and looked behind me, I saw nothing. Even thought there was nothing I ran back home with Buck right behind me the whole way, Somehow in bed that night I had forgotten about the woods experience and feel asleep with no problems

But just like the night before I woke up in the dead of night. I just tried going back to sleep and right when I was about to doze off I heard the noise again, a deep static groan. I had to go look at the window out of curiosity and yet again I saw the crazy skeleton like being with the walkie talkie, along with the groan I heard my dog whimpering, My eyes took a while to adjust to the darkness, but when they did I saw in the hands of the skeleton Buck was there, I screamed and as I did the Skelton creature ripped my dog in half like nothing, as I heard my parents barge the room the Skelton disappeared like a blink of an eye. The police showed up the next morning and asked us what happened, believe it or not, they didn’t believe me as I told them in tears. I even tried to show them the talkie but it was gone from under my bed, I looked and looked all around but never found it. Those memories were like a lucid dream and I hope I can forget about the creature in the Oregon woods. Don’t ever pick up a talkie in the woods of Oregon for the love of good please don’t.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wf8fn2/i_just_found_out_i_have_a_brother_that_my_parents/) 

With what's being happening the last few days, I started to believe I was losing it, I didn’t know what was real anymore. Before I found out I had a brother, I had the perfect life, a loving family, good friends and zero stress, now all I have is paranoia and loneliness. I wish I could go back to that night and wake my dad or mom and make sure that door was locked, that way he would have never escaped, and I would be living in my dream world, oblivious to the truth, but at least I would be happy. 

Since I found out about him, that’s all I could think about. My birthday was coming up and my parents usually threw me a party, the thoughts of that really hit me; the cake, the presents, surrounded by all my family and friends, it seems so cruel now. Last year was one of the best I had, I got everything I wanted, while he was up there in a cold dark attic, the only company he got was a brief visit from my dad, and that was just to feed him. I don’t think I will be able to celebrate anything like that ever again without thinking of him, I will never forgive my parents for that. 

I don’t care what is wrong with him, no one deserves a life like that, and I was going to do whatever I could to free him. I tried talking to my parents a few times after that night, I was hoping they would have given me some sort of logical explanation for what they did to him. But they denied everything and tried to make me believe it was just a dream. They nearly had me fooled too, until one night I overheard them talking in their room. 

My mom said something about his condition that it can’t be controlled, and that he could hurt a lot of people again if he got out. Then they started arguing about what to do with him, my mom wanted to keep him close, but my dad wanted to send him back, to where, I don’t know. Mom came storming out of the room before I could find out and caught me listening in. I tried to confront her and told her what I had heard, but she believes I am that same stupid little kid that thought fairies lived in the attic and told me some bullshit story, but I knew better.  

That was the last time I asked them any questions like that again, they would only lie to me anyways. If I were going to find out the truth, I would have to be smart. The only problem was they had become very suspicious of me, so I had to make them believe I was on their side. It was easy, they are sociopaths, they thought they could fool me into believing anything they said, all I had to do was play dumb and agree with whatever they told me.  

By day I was their perfect little angel, always obedient, like the trained monkey they wanted me to be. But, by night while they were sleeping, I started to communicate with my brother by gently knocking on the ceiling, he may not have understood me, but at least he knew I was there for him, that was the only time I felt normal, I was unable to sleep and when I did, I had horrible nightmares. 

I started to feel really lonely at nights, so after a while I begin speaking to him, I didn’t care if he could hear me or not, I was just happy to have someone to talk to. I was sure I was never going to get a reply until one night he must have found a way to get into the air vents, because I began to hear him whispering, the first night it only lasted a few seconds, and it was kind of muffled but I’m sure he said, “It's in your food, check their closet.”  

I wasn’t sure exactly what he meant, so the next day when my mom was cooking dinner and dad was at work, I checked to see if he was telling the truth. In the back of my mom's closet I found a bottle with my name on the label, it was dated for the day after they told me about my brother, and it was almost half empty. I couldn’t believe it, they were actually drugging me; but it did explain all the weird things I was seeing. I was sure they were putting it in my food so, after that whenever they gave me something that they prepared, I threw it out when they weren’t looking, but they must have found another way because things only got worse. The horrible nightmares I had, started happening while I was awake. 

The first time I experienced it I was in the bathroom washing my hands after having dinner at my friend's house. Suddenly, I heard giggling and little footsteps outside the door, I was sure it was just Tonys little sister, so I said, “just a minute I'm nearly done.” Then everything went dark, even though it was the middle of the day, I panicked and ran for the door, but tripped and fell. When I tried to get up, something grabbed my legs, then my arms, and I could feel myself getting dragged away.  

The next thing I knew I was on the bathroom floor screaming like a little girl, Tony's parents were standing over me, it was so embarrassing. I really freaked them out, so they rang my parents; I tried to convince them that a bug scared me, but I don’t think they believed me, they were acting weird for the rest of the night. 

When I went home that night my brother started talking to me again, this time his voice was clear, and I could understand him perfectly. He told me my parents drug him every day and that’s why he can only talk at night. He said they were part of a cult and they believed he was possessed, so as a baby, they wanted to sacrifice him, but my mom couldn’t do it, so she faked his death instead. Unfortunately, she believed he still had a demon inside him and locked him up ever since. 

I really didn’t want to trust him, but what choice had I got, if he is right and I do nothing, I could be living up there with him for the rest of my life. I don’t know what will happen If I am wrong, but surely it can't be any worse than this. He asked me to steal the key from dad, but he always has it in his pocket, so I would have to sneak into their room in the middle of the night to find it. I begged him to let me go to the cops' instead, but he said they wouldn’t believe me without proof. 

The problem is, I am a nervous wreck. When I was a child I stole a cookie from the cookie jar before dinner, all through that dinner I was on the verge of a panic attack, in the end I couldn’t take the pressure anymore and confessed everything. So the night when I was meant to steal the key I chickened out at the last minute. I felt so guilty for being such a coward, and to make it worse I could hear him whispering things like, “Please Josh, help me before it's too late” or “do you want to be locked up here with me because you will; I heard them talking about it” he went on like that for most of the night. 

I was too ashamed to reply and tried to ignore him, but it was hard because I could hear the desperation in his voice. By morning I had enough, I could not face another night like that, so while my parents were out, I spent the entire day searching for that key, or at least some sort of proof that I had a brother to show the police. I didn’t find the key, but I did find something in a photo album. My mom loved that kind of thing, she was very organized. She documented every step of my life since I was about 3 or 4, but weirdly there was nothing before that, it was like I didn’t exist. Oh yeah, there was one more thing, I found a burlap sack shoved in behind the fridge with a little bottle of clear liquid and a hypodermic needle inside. 

That was the last straw, I was sure everything my brother told me was the truth and my parents were planning to lock me up. I couldn’t wait until that night to break him out, so I got a claw hammer from the shed and tried to break the locks. The first one was easy, it only took a few hard strikes, but the other two were strong and wouldn’t budge. I gave up when I whacked my finger off the corner of the door and went looking for something bigger. Unfortunately, when I got to the bottom of the stairs my mom walked in, and screamed when she saw me, then my dad started chasing me. Luckily I got out the back door before he caught me. 

I hid in the forest behind my house for hours trying to figure out what to do, before I finally made the decision to go to the police, by then it was nearly nightfall. The whole way there I went over everything in my head to make sure I got my story straight, but by the time I actually got there, I had become so nervous I was shaking. I walked in and saw the sheriff standing up behind the desk talking to a woman with his back to me. I was about to speak but the woman screamed, it was only then I realized, all my clothes were covered in blood from the cut I got from banging my hand off the door, by the looks on their faces I'd say they thought I was after murdering someone. 

I tried to speak again but stuttered. In that moment I was sure they were going to pull out their guns and order me to get on the floor or something like that, but instead the sheriff calmly said, “son, you hurt?”  

It was at that moment that it all hit me, and I broke down crying. I told him everything and I mean everything, I even told him about the recurring dream I had as a child. He must have thought I was crazy, I was waiting for him to throw me into a cell, but he didn’t. He just said, “everything's ok son, come with me.”  and he took me to the car, I started to freak out when he stopped outside my house. So, he told me to wait there until he came back, to my relief, because I really didn’t want to go inside. 

I have no idea how long he was in there, but it seemed like hours. I was going over all kinds of scenarios in my head, from my parents chopping up the sheriff and hiding his body to him coming out with a burlap sack and dragging me to the attic himself. I was nervous but slightly relieved when I saw the sheriff walking towards me. When he asked me to come with him, I nearly shit myself. Terrified I blurted out, “please don’t make me go in there, they will lock me in the attic with my brother” while he held my hand and took me inside.  

“Relax son, there is nothing to be afraid of,” that's all he said to me as he took me upstairs. 

At the attic door I panicked and tried to run but I ended up running into my dad's arms, at that point I was sure it was all one big conspiracy, and I was going to be locked up there forever. So, I kicked and screamed the whole way like a toddler. When I got to the top, I realized there was nothing up there apart from a few old boxes and some Christmas decorations. It didn’t make any sense, I was lost for words; I really thought there would still be some sign of him up there, but there was nothing. When I asked why they always kept the attic door locked my dad said it was because the floors were only partly finished, and he was afraid I would fall through the ceiling and get hurt. 

As my mom walked me to my room, I heard my dad tell the sheriff that I had stopped taking my meds. The truth is, I was beginning to believe him, and thought it was all in my imagination, until my mom whispered in my ear, “Don’t give in, fight, like I did,” as she put me to bed.

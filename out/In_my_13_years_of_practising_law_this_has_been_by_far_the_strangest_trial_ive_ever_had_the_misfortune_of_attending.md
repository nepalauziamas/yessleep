That day started out pretty normally; I woke up, regretted every decision in my life, kissed my wife good morning, then put on one of those tight, itchy, “classy” suit before heading to work.

I walked to work, thinking about the case I was going to go and defend. It was a losing battle. My client refused to take my advice and plead guilty to get a life sentence instead of the execution he’d receive if the jury found him guilty themselves. The investigation is still ongoing, but he thinks they won’t find anything. From the smug look the district attorney gave me last time I saw her, I think they already have.

I called my client on the way (he’s out on bail. Bailed on a child murder charge. Yes, he’s that rich), and the call only added to the misery of my morning. He was an asshole, always irritated. I tried to go over my instructions with him about today’s hearing, but he was doing that thing when he’s saying affirmatives the proper amount and intervals but you just know he’s dismissing you. I don’t like being mocked, and yet- this is my job. Rent needs to be paid. Moving on.

After a serie of reluctant hellos from acquaintances, I’m finally sitting next to my client in the court. The district attorney is running late, so unlike her. It was then my anxiety sprang into life, running possibilities. Her lateness is either unwarranted, good for me, or she has a trick up her sleeve that needs some tweaking, bad for me. And because it’s anxiety, it also suggests that maybe she got into a car crash and died. I shut it off immediately.

Just as the judge starts losing her patience, the district attorney bursts through the door (only a figure of speech, she came normally as to not disturb the court), and sat in her designed seat, same front row as I am, you know the drill. I examine her. She looks composed as ever, eyeliner perfectly though a bit too creatively winged. Her makeup was impeccable, save for a concealer that wasn’t nearly enough to cover her eye bags, her dark hair put into braids around her head, and her suit had not a trace of a wrinkle on it. She smiled, if with a bit of nervosity poorly hidden, confidently. By her side was a school bag. My client and I stared, wide eyes, baffled. Even him understood that you just do not bring a piece of evidence and carry it this casually. Or maybe it was because he recognized it. Idk.

“Running late, Mrs. Yang?” the judge chastised with a sharp tone.

“My apologies, your honor.”

“alright, Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Calling the case of the People of the State of \[REDACTED\] versus Edward M. on the murder of 14 year old Lucas S. Are both sides ready? ”

I will spare you the full procedure. I put on my customer service voice, gave my opening; short and consice; I stressed the fact that there was yet no definitive proof that my client is guilty and that, therefore, he cannot be justly detained. The district attoney spoke next, she gave her opening-long and sentimental, as expected. After came the time to interview witnesses. I called Meredith, my client’s wife to the stand to testify. I asked her standard questions. “where were you the third of november, at 6am?” she said she was at home, her husband by her side in bed. “when did he leave the house?” “Seven thirty.” I toss a look at the jury, they’re not convinced, I’m not either, but I’m doing my best with what I have. This is an uphill battle. I knew it even moreso when I saw Yang interview my witness, tear into her allegations with such ease, exposing her lies bare. I tried to keep my cool. There was no substancial evidence yet, maybe I still got this. God, I hoped I did. I did not.

“the witness is excused.” The judge said. “the prosecution may call the next witness.”

This was the beginning of the end.

“The people call a very special guest, one who travelled many lenghts to attend this court. If your honor may allow me a few minutes of the court’s time in order to accommodate their arrival?”

The judge and I both had our interests piqued. “You may.” She said.

Yang smiled and reached for the backpack under the table, walked to the well of the court, then emptied it’s contents. It spilled a black, gooey substance. Everybody was far too confused to object, argue, or do anything really. We all sat and watched as the district attorney apparently lost her mind. The substance stank of rot, it was unbearable. Before anybody could protest, the lights started to flicker on and off and a sudden air of fright washed upon us and sealed our voices shut. A fog started to form inside the room and the doors all slammed shut as if by a strong wind. I looked around, trembling. We all did, except for Yang. She stood there calmly and waved

"I call into the stand, the murder victim; Lucas S." She waves at the stand, and the hair on my skin stands at the sight of it. The stand, which had been empty a few moments ago is now occupied by the translucent body of a teenager, flickering between two images, one resembling the photos we've all seen of him, a lively teenage boy with dark red hair, brilliant blue eyes and freckles spilled on his nose and across his cheeks, wearing a band t-shit and jean shorts. The second image is elementally the same, but his skin is yellow, almost blueish in color, green rot and what looks from afar like maggots have replced his eyes while multiple bloody gashes cut across his face. His jaw is slack, leaning to one side while dark almost black blood spills from it and stains his teeth. His t-shirt is ripped and bloodied, barely covering a grotesque rotting torso riddled with stab wounds. Moss and river plants hang on his shoulders, from his mouth and from the gaps on his shirt.

I turn slowly to my client, only to see him passed out in terror. I should be pissing my pants right now, but I find enough courage in myself to give my back to the monster and slap the one besides me awake. He wakes with a jolt, and looks at him, then back at me, then at Yang, all color drained from his face. "What the hell, man.." He mutters in a trembling voice. He gets up, and sprints for the door (I should've done that, why didn't I do that?). Turning to his direction, I see that everyone else besides me, Edward, Yang, judge Otusanya, the jury, and the spirit of Lucas S. has disappeared. Edward tries the door, pulls at it when all his strength, but it's somehow locked. "Y..Yang, what is the meaning of this?" The judge stumbles down her high chair, cross in hand. She yells in all the authority that terror has left her. "Stop this at once!"

"I'm afraid I cannot, you Honor." Yang says cooly, smile not even faltering. "He will not be leaving until he gets to testify. There is no other way. Such is his right." "Are you fucking insane?" I find myself yelling. She ignores me. "Please, may I carry on the interview, your honor?" The judge stared at me, I stared back. Some of the jury members were crying. I wanted to cry too. "What if I delay this hearing to another date?" "I'm afraid that's not possible either. He will not let anyone out until the trial is done." As if on cue, the boy, still flickering and not settling on an image, stretched out his arm, and Edward, still wrestling with the door, flew as if pulled by an unnatural force (which was probably what was happening), and seated on his previous seat. Cuffs flew from the floor and chained him to the table.

The silence that follows is unbearable. Sweat froms on my brow as I stare into the abnormality on the stand. No matter what image he is, he is fuzzy around the edges, translucency going up and down on a spectrum while he was still visible. He catches my eyes, and I turn around so quickly my neck almost cramps, terror whispers in my ears that he'll kill me, if not for defending his murderer then it will be for staring. His murderer! The fact thag Yang brought him here with such confidence only means that Edward really did kill him. *"I'm just doing my job!"* I want to yell at him. *"I gotta put food on the table somehow, man!"* but I doubt that will faze him. What would a 14 year old know about providing? Would he have empathy for it? "You may carry out the interview, Yang." Otusanya says in a trembling voice.

"Thank you." Yang nods, then with the softest voice possible, she asks the boy. "Lucas, Can you tell us what happened?" And he spoke. His voice sounded like a lot of people at once, but had the distinct high pitch and cracks of a teenager's voice.

"I went to school everyday from 7am to 3pm. I lived pretty far, and walked to school so I'd be out of my home as early as five thirty. Ever since the beginning of the year, I always felt off going to school. I felt watched. The day I died was the day I met Edward. He asked me for directions, then asked me to walk him, then asked me to help him carry the bag he had in his hand, then asked me to wait for him as he took a leak in the forest, then he asked me to come see a deer carcass. I was too kind, too naive to say no. I was taught to be helpful, that every good deed returned and paved the way to make your life easier in the future. This one cost me my life. He pushed me to the ground, pulled a knife and stabbed me, twisted the knife, punched my bones broken, kicked until I was a heap of bones, blood and pain. When I died, he tossed me into the river like a water bottle, like a cigarette butt he was done burning. Everything that I was and everything that I know and everything that I was to become he ended for a reason I don't yet know. Why did you do it, Edward? Was it worth it?"

To say I was speechless was an understatement. Edward remained silent as well. Though with the pallor of his face he might as well be dead.

“Criminal defense, do you have any questions for the witness?”

Startled to be addressed, i quickly muttered a “No, your honor.”

“Really, Marc” Yang replied with a sneer. “In every other case you always had something to say. I’m sure you do now. Don’t be shy.”

If it weren’t for the vengeful spirit by her side I would’ve cussed her out. I forced a fake smile. “I’ll.. I’ll pass.”

It was then I felt a force pulling me to the well of the court. I stood there frozen, almost pissing my pants. “Ask.” The spirit said between gritted teeth.

My head was reeling, *“fuck, this was it?”* I thought. The thing was, aside from the pure terror I felt at the moment, I really didn’t have any questions to ask. At leats, none that wouldn’t offend him into killing us all at once. Like, *“What were you wearing at the time?”* or *“Was either of you intoxicated?”.* If this were a regular witness, I’d work on undermining their confidence, string out lies and inconsistencies in their stories. But hell, this is the damn victim. What is there to undermine?

I took out my emergency cards, on them were questions intended for different witnesses, obviously. There was one for his mother, one for the officer in charge of the investigation, and another for the hiker who found hos body. The cards were useful, their familiarity helped me compose myself, and helped remind me of what a question is, something I’ve forgotten in my fright. My memory, jumpstarted with adrenaline and hope, rewound not only every case I’ve defended, but also every horror movie I had watched (while tuning out, of course, everytime the main characters died horribly at the hands of a supernatural abomination). Basically, I organized every useful information into a neat powerpoint projected on my brain. It was some of my best cognitive work, hell, it even gave me a golden answer. I put on my confidence mask and decided; if I die, so be it. But I’m not gonna die frightened.

“Alright then.” I cleared my throat. “What’s your name and age?”

His normal face gave me an annoyed look. “Lucas M. S., fourteen years old.”

“eye color?”

“Blue.”

“Names of parents?

“Objection. Relevance?” Yang sounded annoyed as well. Just my goal.

“Pardon me,” I say innocently. “I was just checking to make sure his memory woks well, since, you know, I’m sure something as traumatic as death would certainly make a mind foggy.”

The boy looked angry. Both his faces were. Typical teenage temper. “My memory works just fine!” his voice came out deeper, more static-y.

“You see, that’s where I disagree. You said you walked to school, right?”

“Yes.”

“But here I have that you lived in the suburbs near the Bradson and Co wool factory. There’s a bus that picks up two blocks away from your residence, and stops right across the street from Nixon high, your school. Even if you didn’t take the bus for some reason, it’s a three hours walk, not one and a half. Besides, if you take the bridge, which most people do, you’ll be able to avoid the woods completely.” I turned to the judge and district attorney. “I know, my brother lives there. I go every weekend.” Then I continued. “The only way the trajectory you described would work is if you lived in the Kimley corner, which you did, before your family moved out in 1997, when you were in elementary school.”

I took a pause to evaluate the reactions. The spirit was too puzzled to be angry. “See Lucas, I’m not saying you’re lying. I believe you just got it mixed up. It happens.” He looked at me, confused. “And yet, it is a pretty big mix-up. Who’s to tell that your memory is completely intact? That death didn’t take from you more than your heartbeat and corporeal body?”

“Your honor, we can’t possible draw conclusions-“

“I’m not done yet. Your honor, look at him, his eyes are blue, correct?”

“yes, they are”

“and yet,” I took out a couple prints of three pictures. Two selfies and one group photo. “in the selfies, you can clearly see that his eyes are green, it’s just that the particular lighting in the group photo makes them look blue. Moreso, the band t-shirt he’s wearing, and in which he was found dead, is a Black Veil Bride t-shirt, not the Pierce the Veil t-shirt he’s wearing right now, as he never owned one. But I see how someone, who had only seen the tattered and faded shirt, would make the mixup. Even more, Lucas was, in life, taller than average, which is not the case here. With inconsistencies at this scale, your honor, one cannot help but wonder, if this is the ghost of Lucas S. who can’t even remmeber what he looked like, or is it someone, or something else entirely? Who’s to say, that this isn’t a long dead spirit that forgot itself, and stuck to the first identity offered, searching desperatly for an image to claim?”

I turned to the spirit, to find his image even blurrier, but what I can see of the expression on his face is an incredible devastated one. “I ask you, once again, what’s your name?”

A heavy silence falls, before a choked voice came out, seemingly from everywhere, and said “I don’t know. I don’t know.” A devastated cry filled the room as the figure on the stand dissipated, and the courtroom returned to normal, with the audience present, the doors unlocked, and air much, much breathable. Despite myself, I broke down crying of relief.

My client was ruled innocent, and attorney Yang, unable to be charged with anything as summoning a ghost to testify isn’t exactly a crime, lost her law license.

So now, what I came here to ask, is how to live with the fact the spirit of Lucas was actually correct about the adress? How do I live with the fact that I, in case the spirit was really Lucas, potentially might have both psychologically manipulated an already frail mind into losing it’s sense of identity, and caused a murderer to walk free? This what-if is driving me crazy, I can’t sleep at night anymore.  The only thing that can save me is if they find a different murderer and confirm that the spirit was, in fact, not Lucas. Until then, I might never know. The uncertainity haunts me. It doesn’t help that as I go to bed every night, I can almost see red hair and piercing blue eyes on the reflection on my window.

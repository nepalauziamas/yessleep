Hi everyone my name is Ava Wayne and today I am eight years old :) . I was eight yesterday for the first time but now I am even older! I got to use my mom’s computer today (but shhh don’t tell her!). Last night when my dad came home from work he brought me a big chocolate cake with vanilla frosting that had my name on it and I got to blow out the candles. I didn’t even have to eat dinner first! It was the best day even though I didn’t have a party.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It doesn’t matter though because I’ve never had a party before. My mom and dad say that I’m not allowed because we can’t have any other people in the house. They lie and tell me that it’s because we live too far away but I know that it is because of my friend Eevie who lives with us. Eevie looks exactly like me and we are like sisters. She is not really my sister though, we just say that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eevie can do this really cool trick where she can move my arms and say things in my voice. Sometimes it is a little bit annoying but she’s my friend so it’s okay. My mom and dad don’t like Eevie though and this makes her very mad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My mom says that Eevie needs help and we have to see someone for her. I don’t know what she means, but Eevie says that my mom is a liar and I don’t like telling Eevie that she is wrong. My dad gets really mad and yells at Eevie to stop and to shut up and leave me alone but that just makes her more mad. I’ve tried to tell him to stop but he doesn’t listen.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yesterday when my dad brought home the cake he asked me if I liked it and I told him yes and that Eevie liked it too. He got really mad but my mom told him that it was not the time and he didn’t say anything about her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When they lit the candles and told me to make a wish I didn’t know what to wish for. I kind of wanted some new paints so that I could make more paintings for my room, but I also wanted a puppy or some new toys. Mostly I wanted to wish for Eevie to stay but Eevie thought that was a stupid wish because she says she’s always going to be with me forever so I didn’t wish for that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I asked Eevie what else I should wish for and my dad got really mad and told me to just make a wish already because this was none of Eevies business. That made me a little bit sad because it was Eevies business and she was with us and that was rude of him to yell at her like that. My mom said it was okay but dad said that it was not normal. Eevie was also getting mad because dad said she wasn’t normal. Everyone was just mad mad mad and I almost cried but then Eevie told me to just make my wish because she would make any of my wishes come true.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I thought about it really hard but then mom told me to hurry up or else the cake was going to get ruined so I finally decided to wish for my parents to leave Eevie alone and be nice to her. Then I blew out the candles and my mom clapped but I could tell that my dad was still mad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We ate cake anyway but I didn’t ask if Eevie could have some because it was finally a good time. We finished the ENTIRE cake all by ourselves and I was even allowed to have TWO WHOLE PIECES. It was awesome.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Last night I had a really scary nightmare that I stabbed my mom and my dad in their bed when they were asleep. It was really scary and I woke up and cried but I don’t think they heard me because no one came to check on me. Only Eevie was there and she said it was okay.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

When it was morning I got up but my mom didn’t make any breakfast and she didn’t answer when I was yelling for her. Eevie says that they are still asleep and that I shouldn’t go up to their room so I didn’t.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eevie helped me to make breakfast. She showed me how to make a burrito with eggs and some chicken that she bought. It was really messy because Eevie said that it was fresh meat that had just been killed. I already know that they kill animals for food because my grandpa has a farm and I had seen them make a turkey before so I knew that it was very messy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After I ate Eevie said that we could watch tv. She said that I didn’t even have to clean up because mom and dad weren’t going to even see it. She told me that she made my wish come true and that they weren’t going to be mad at us anymore and they weren’t going to yell at us either. Eevie says that now we can do whatever we want.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I had ice cream and I watched cartoons all morning instead of going to school and when the phone rang and the school called Eevie talked to them and she sounded just like my mom! She told them that I was sick and the lady believed her! It was so fun and I didn’t even know that she could do that!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eevie let me use my moms laptop because she says she knows the password. She told me I could write on here like a diary and post it so other people could read it! Isn’t that so cool? I wonder who is reading this haha :).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eevie just made me lunch and it was a sandwich with meat again. I don't eat this much meat because my mom likes for me to eat my veggies but Eevie says that mom is not the boss anymore so I can eat whatever I want. I had a lot of chips and my tummy started to hurt and I really wanted my mom but Eevie said that it was okay and she could make it feel better.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Eevie told me to take a nap and so I did but I had another scary dream that I was cutting up mom and dad because Eevie was making me. When I woke up Eevie said it was just a dream because mom and dad were still asleep upstairs. I want to go and see them but Eevie says I can’t or else it will ruin the wish and we will get in big trouble for making a mess and eating junk.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think I’m going to go play hide-and-seek with Eevie now. :)

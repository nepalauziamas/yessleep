[The death of Ms Esther Beckman](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/h86ihe/the_previous_tenant_left_a_survival_guide_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) hit me hard. She would’ve lambasted me for writing her name that way but I feel like it’s important that people remember it in its entirety. Essie was special, she deserves that much.

I didn’t get to spend long with her, but I was grateful that I’d met her at all. The committee’s initiative to shop for vulnerable residents during lockdown had been devised to benefit those residents but I believe that I had needed Essie more than she ever needed me. She’d become my lifeline in that short time. The only distraction from my atrocious misjudgments. And she was gone. 

When I got off the phone from Terri I lit up a cigarette for Essie. I quietly sobbed at my fold up table into my cup of tea. I couldn’t understand why she would do what she did. Walking into the lift between 1.11 and 3.33 as the creatures who inhabited it were at the height of their frenzy was an unmistakable suicide. 

I felt the pang of loss. It, in turn, ignited an emotional muscle memory and I was put back in the place I had been in all those months ago, I felt every emotion I had felt when I stepped into the lift and repeated the ritual. When I sentenced Jamie to a life spent as one of *them things.* 

Essie was the first to perish in the lift since the creatures ripped Jamie apart on the night we moved in. The whole block are aware of the dangers, which ironically, made the risk pretty low. Prudence Hemmings’ negligence had lead to my tragedy but there was nothing to explain what had happened to my new friend. 

I had only known her for a short time but she really was full of life. She spoke about missing her son and grandson and how we would get to have a cup of tea together that I didn’t have to drink in the corridor one day. She had plans. I didn’t believe that she’d wanted to die. 

Her last words of advice to me rang through my mind. 

*One of your friends needs help. You need to know that it is possible.*

What if she had been talking about herself and she just hadn’t realised? I wondered if I’d already failed her. Maybe this wasn’t about Jamie at all. Ideas snowballed in my mind for what felt like hours, sat at that table. 

My thoughts were eventually interrupted by a knock on the door. It was Terri and the kids. I opened and they stood back a safe distance. 

“I’m sorry Kat, I know you probably want to be alone but the the kids knew you’d be sad about Ms Beckman and they wanted to come and see you.

“I’ve already dropped some bits off to Mr Prentice and the couple next door, so you don’t have to worry today.” 

Terri was sweet. She’s been nothing but nice to me right from the start and I loved those kids like my own flesh and blood. She was wrong about me wanting to be alone, just seeing the twins faces lifted my spirits. 

“Here’s an air hug Kat!” Eddie made a cuddling motion with his arms, gripping the thin air of the corridor. It was adorable. One of the hairless cats that walk the halls played at his feet, being careful not to brush against him so as not to burn his young skin. 

“Air hugs back.” I answered. “I miss you guys.” 

“We miss you too! Mum says she can’t wait until you can babysit us again! Don’t be sad.” Ellie added, melting my heart a little. They were growing into such kind and amazing people. You would struggle to believe that they looked like demons all night long and never slept.

I could see that Terri was struggling. She had huge dark circles under her eyes and had yawned multiple times in a short interaction. I felt for her, as much as I love those kids the lack of sleep when I do sit for them is killer. I couldn’t imagine having gone as long as we’d been locked down existing on stolen hours here and there like Terri does. 

“I can’t wait either! We’re going to have so much....” I couldn’t finish my sentence, my attention was grabbed by an almighty scraping sound coming from inside my flat. 

“Are you ok?” Terri started, noticing my sudden silence and change of expression. 

“I’m fine.” I answered bluntly. 

I wasn’t. The noise became more frantic in the background. 

“What’s that noise Kat?” Eddie asked with a childlike innocence. I didn’t want to lie him but I had no intention of telling the truth, there was a reason I only babysat in Terri’s flat. I couldn’t bare for the kids to be at risk or think of me as a monster. The scraping and scratching slowly started to become bangs and crashes. 

“I have to go. Thank you for coming to see me. You’ve made my day guys, you have no idea. I’ll see you soon I promise.” And with that I shut the door and bolted the latch. 

I felt awful. I never wanted to be so rude, they had treated me as family but after dragging them through so much when we first met I didn’t want to subject them to *him*. They didn’t deserve to suffer my mistakes. 

I ran to the padlocked wardrobe and froze, staring at it for a few minutes. I watched as the central line where the two doors met expanded and contracted with every pound from inside. As if the doors were breathing. He had started to wheeze and grunt uncontrollably. In all these months I hadn’t seen behaviour like it. I was genuinely fearful that if I opened the door he would rip me apart, limb from limb.

How the fuck did my life come to that? Hiding from my undead, semi-rodent boyfriend. 

I sat down in front of the breathing doors with my back to them in an attempt to keep him in and cried. I felt like that’s all I’d done. Cried. The fighting spirit had been knocked out of me. I’d been reduced to a snivelling mess. 

The pounding on the door didn’t stop. As the time passed he didn’t calm down, he just became more desperate, frenzied. I wondered if this was how the ones in the lift had behaved before they tore him to pieces... or as Essie waltzed into their territory. Maybe he was only behaving this way because the others had finally gotten a victim. 

My phone went multiple times, it was Terri. I threw the still ringing phone across the floor and held my head in my hands. 

*thump* 

*grunt*

*buzz*

It became a pattern. The pounding against my back, the phone ringing. All the noises around me started to become formulaic and repetitive. I wanted it to stop so bad. 

“I don’t need this right now Jamie.” I begged, frustrated. I didn’t expect a reply. I’d spoken to him often, trying with everything I could think of to dig out the man I knew, with increasing futility. Regardless, I found it therapeutic to talk.

Not once had I gotten a reply. Until then. 

“KA.....KA” he rasped in something that I can’t really describe as a proper voice. The pounding had stopped. Only the raspy breaths and sounds of saliva dripping from his mouth remained. “KAA..AT” he wheezed finally, as if in pain. 

The tears stopped, I jumped up immediately and fumbled with the key to the padlock to open his prison. As it opened he stared at me, Jamie’s eyes looking sad and desperate. I stared back, wiping the tears from my face. For a brief interlude, it wasn’t the creature looking back at me, it really was Jamie. 

It hurt. For just a moment, I was truly alone with my soulmate. But it didn’t last, it couldn’t. 

His eyes turned from the familiar blue tone to black. It made him look more rodent like, the lack of a distinguishable iris made them beady, just like a rat. I stood still, watching uncomfortably as he stood on his hind legs, stretching out from his usual hunched positioning. I noted the sharp teeth, tucked underneath his deformed and fleshy nose. It was one of the few patches with no fur. 

In the blink of an eye he launched himself forward, clawing at my face. I was taken off guard and flew backwards as he made contact. He hesitated on top of me, my face inches from his grotesque snout for a moment, baring his teeth with a lust in those black eyes, spittle dripping onto my face from the tips of his sharpened fangs. 

He didn’t seem so small anymore.

It gave me just enough time to roll the fire poker I kept up against the wardrobe towards me. Weaponising the entire flat was a rule of Prudence’s that, unlike others, had actually proved useful. I gripped it with my right hand as I felt his claws start to penetrate my chest, sending a seering pain through my body. 

I plunged the poker into the side of Rat Jamie’s neck. Watching as deep crimson blood splattered across the room and the doors of the wardrobe, I started to hyperventilate. He rolled off me in a heavy slump. 

Had I killed him? I thought. Was my nightmare finally over? I agonised over the fact I hadn’t had the bottle to put him out of his misery but had been able to follow through when he attacked me. I felt like such a selfish person. 

Despite this, I was relieved, looking at the blood and the unmoving fur heap on the floor next to me. My hand shook violently, alerting me that I was still holding the poker. I dropped it instantly with a loud clank and took a moment to breathe. 

My relief was short lived. The furry patchy heap on the floor started to slowly rise and sink rhythmically. He was breathing. Blood stopped pouring from the wound and he lethargically raised a clawed hand to wipe at the area like an animal would. I took no chances and dragged him back into the cupboard before his strength rebuilt. 

I know what you’re all thinking and I assure you, it crossed my mind too. Just keep going, keep stabbing until he doesn’t wake up. It’s a reasonable thought process. I wish it were that simple, but nothing in this building is. If he got up from that attack, stabbing wasn’t the answer. He should’ve been dead... 3 times over with the amount of blood lost. Even if I wanted him dead, at this stage I had no idea how. 

It fucked me up. Trying to make connections between his sudden ability to communicate, the attack and Essie’s prediction. I didn’t even know where to start. 

I placed a bowl of cat food next to the weary creature, locked the cupboard and placed the second, unnecessary chair from my fold out table against the centre of the two doors. I was at a total loss and things were spiralling out of control. 

I sat on the now singular chair in my living room and smoked. I smoked and I drank tea. I think it must be some kind of ingrained British coping mechanism I’ve adopted, because whilst it didn’t cure my anxiety, it did calm me down. 

I texted Terri to tell her everything was fine. I tried to type out the truth... multiple times, but I deleted every single attempt. I didn’t know how to tell her I’d lied to her for all this time. So I carried on lying. 

She had always told me she was there if I needed to talk. I know she meant it, she was the most loyal friend I’d ever had. Which is why disappointing her was even more terrifying. 

After a few hours the screaming started. The inhuman, earth shattering screaming with intervals of low growls. Jamie had come to. 

The noises rivalled Mr Prentice’s and I wondered if the neighbours would be concerned, but in a block like mine late night screaming and growling is the norm. Jamie could be eating me alive and no one might think to check. Even if they did, there’s not much they could do to help. I visualised Percy and Sylvia turning up their television to drown out my screams. 

It wasn’t screams of pain, it was anger. A battle cry. The attack he’d subjected me to was just a warning. I could feel the disdain coming through the thin wooden barrier separating us. If his behaviour continued, I was going to be dead, for sure. 

About 11pm I couldn’t take it anymore and I decided I was going to take my government approved exercise and get the fuck out of my four walls. 

The halls were alive. The more peaceful of our not so average residents had utilised the quiet time to enjoy their home. The cats frolicked, wrestling and chasing each other up and down the stairs. I wondered if they skipped for the them too and if they’d ever escaped each other by ending up on different floors. 

As I descended, the man on floor 5 was as stoic as ever. I smiled, he had become somewhat of a favourite of mine, passing him on the stairs always meant that home was nearby. 

“Hi Clive!” I waved at him as I passed. I gave him a different name every time in the hope that one day I would get it right. He didn’t respond, didn’t even look, but then again he never did. I added Clive to my catalogue of not-names. 

The boy who lived in the mirror that runs adjacent to the stairs waved. His hair was tousled and messy and he wore a stained green stripe t shirt. He pulled faces and blew raspberries frantically at me in my reflection. I blew them back, pushing up the centre of my nose to resemble a pig, which was met with silent, roaring laughter. 

The stairs were poorly lit at night, but I still managed to count every landing I reached. 9 flights this time. Not bad, I thought, grateful it wasn’t any worse. When I reached the bottom I felt a release, like everything bad about my life was locked away in that flat and I was free. 

It was chilly outside. I had worn a thin cardigan but I could still feel it in the air. I made a beeline for the bench by the postage stamp of a garden next to the block. It was strange to see the city so empty, usually outside the tower was brimming with activity, but the threat of the virus had left it desolate. As I sat in the cool air I tried to clear my mind.  

A good friend once told me that being in nature helps our brains to release serotonin and it’s true. The soil will literally make you happier.  I tried to embrace the serenity of the nature but it was soon infiltrated by a series of tiny mewing sounds coming from the foliage I had planted against the outer wall of the block. 

I fumbled in my pockets for my phone and played around with it until the torch turned on. I approached the greenery with caution, not wanting to spook a cat if it was injured in there. 

The fallen bits of foliage crunched underneath my feet as I got closer to the small shrub but the mewing didn’t stop, after a gentle search I realised that the sound was coming from 3 tiny kittens.

They were so small, with wrinkled, furless skin. They weren’t newborn, their eyes were open and they were relatively alert. They were for certain offspring of the cats that wandered the halls. I was baffled, I’d had no idea they could reproduce. As the largest of the 3 rubbed its head against my hand I felt my fingers singe a little. 

I sat with the kittens for ages, they took the opportunity to sit in my lap pretty quickly and I waited for their mother to return. I grew increasingly worried and the 3 little naked kittens seemed to get cold. I set them down on the bench wrapped in my cardigan and started to call for the mother, shivering myself. 

About 20 minutes passed and nothing appeared. I wrapped the bundle up a little snugglier for extra warmth and started to search the bushes. They were part of a planted bed that stretched a third of the length of the tower block. I kept an eye on the bench and moved further along the foliage. 

I looked hard until I eventually found something. A fair sized ventilation grate was hidden behind one of the shrubs, I hadn’t remembered it being there when I planted it. Poking through the metal bars was a vine of some sorts that seemed to be growing upwards through it from the inside, making it impossible to see. The grate lead to what must have been a basement. 

A basement that the block didn’t have. 

I squinted hard, trying to make out the inside of the room but I couldn’t see a thing. After a few seconds I noticed that the vine was visibly growing around my feet, twisting over my shoes. It freaked me out, I dropped my phone and started to wriggle my feet free when I heard an almighty yowl coming from inside the grate. It was the kind you heard when cats were fighting outside your window. 

I fell backwards and was tripped by the vine but broke the piece that was holding onto me as I kicked at it. The shrub I had moved aside covered up the grate again and the yowling stopped suddenly. I ripped the piece of vine off my foot and grabbed my phone with the other hand. The torch was still beaming into the night sky. 

I tried to dig back through the bushes but the grate was gone and so was the rest of the vine. I put the piece that had snapped off in my pocket and returned to the bench. The yowling gave me a bad feeling about the kittens mother, so I scooped them up and carried them back inside with me. They gently mewed the entire way.

I was frozen and covered in goosebumps, it was approaching the time that the lift became dangerous and I wanted to make sure the kittens were ok. So I didn’t investigate the downstairs when I entered. I rushed up the stairs - only 5 flights this time- and unlocked the door to my flat. 

The screaming had stopped and had been replaced by a loud, raspy snoring. Jamie had finally tired himself out. I set the kittens in a heap on the sofa and found a few cushions and a blanket for them to curl up on. I would go and get food first thing in the morning. They were adorable, cuddled up in a tiny heap. 

I sat at the fold out table and stared at the piece of vine. It wasn’t growing anymore, but it was healthy. I wondered how it had survived in a basement and how it had been able to grow at such an exponential rate. How had I lived somewhere for almost a year and not realised it had a basement? I placed the vine in a cup of water and started to stress about my inability to find the grate a second time.

My walk to clear my head had just bought up more questions. I couldn’t make sense of any of it. Essie’s death, Jamie’s sudden behaviour change, the kittens, the basement... that vine. I had no idea what any of it meant, but I knew I had to find out. 

I didn’t want to sleep anywhere near Jamie, so I curled up on the sofa next to the kittens and put Netflix on in the background. I drifted off to thoughts of the secret basement and [what the fuck might be down there.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePickledGnome/)

A couple of summers ago, I ended up working in the small garden outside at my work, since our workload slows way down in the summer. I worked at a factory that was surrounded by olive trees and other trees like apricot, peach, cherry, pear and apple trees. Beyond the tree line, on one of the short ends of the small, rectangular garden, there were a bunch of tall, thick weeds and shrubbery directly after the front tree line. On the garden fence itself at that end, thick, tangled grape vines had overgrown on the fence for the garden and on the chain link perimeter fence for the property line in that area.

It was a particularly hot day, as it was July. The hummingbirds buzzed near the feeders and other birds were singing their summer songs. I greeted our factory dog buddy, who was lazing outside the garden in the shade of an olive tree. He gazed up at me with his neon-like blue eyes and wagged his black and white fluffy tail at me before dozing off again. I continued to chat at buddy as I worked, just off in my own safe little world.

As I worked though, I began to vaguely notice the sounds of bushes and shrubbery rustling slightly, which I blew off as just a breeze. But after a few minutes more, I realized that the rustling sounds were pretty constant and after briefly glancing around myself at the other trees, I noticed that there didn't appear to be any breeze that hot July day. I just figured at that point that it was probably Buddy, sniffing around in the bushes or something. But, there went that I realized, after I turned back towards the garden entrance for a shovel and there was Buddy, still lazing in the same place. Now, if you know dogs, then you know that buddy should have been losing his s*** right then, yet he was just resting there.

I decided to give it a couple more minutes, just to make sure. It could have been my husband who also worked at the factory with me, or my boss or another co-worker for all I knew. But as I nonchalantly paid attention to what I was hearing, I could tell that the movements were slow and deliberate. Whoever or whatever was in the grapevines and bushes, was moving precisely. My heart began to race as I imagined a bear or a mountain lion stalking.

So then I sneaked out of the garden entrance and stepped over a couple of feet to investigate. It was pretty difficult to see through the thick shrubbery beyond The olive and cherry trees. I had to really focus, like when you try to see one of those hidden 3D images. Once I did though, I started to see movement beyond the grapevines and bushes and weeds. After a few seconds, I began to be able to make out the shape of human legs. Whoever was in there was wearing a pair of medium fade blue jeans and black hiking, or maybe work boots. All I can think at the time was "holy s***, it's a person!" They were moving away from me and towards the railroad tracks beyond the chain link perimeter fence.

All I could think of to do at that point, was to walk around the perimeter fence and up to the railroad tracks to see the person from a slight vantage point. I knew that the person would be trapped by the perimeter fence, which was hidden by the grapevines. Once I got up there, I saw a man crouched down next to the chain link fence, staring right at me. It was super strange to me because he was wearing those medium colored blue jeans and heavy black boots that I mentioned earlier, but he also sported a black beanie, a dark-hooded sweatshirt and a backpack, all despite it being a 100 plus degrees day that day.

As he stared at me with dark, beady, close-set eyes, I managed to ask him "who are you and why are you here?" But he just stared at me, unblinking with his pale face and didn't say a word to me, he just sat there, frozen and unmoving. Looking back, I don't think he blinked or moved at all! So I gave up after a few seconds and went into the factory to tell someone. I found my husband first, but he pretty much just dismissed it. So I went to my boss next.

We both went back out to the garden to investigate, but no one was there anymore, just Buddy casually wandering into the bushes towards the tracks. Buddy, being a dog, should have been alarmed and yet, he wasn't which was weird to my boss also. Just then though, my other coworker arrived with his dog, who was promptly sent to investigate the area. Meanwhile, the other coworker went inside the factory to get the forklift, which he drove outside to us. Then, we had my husband lift the forklift as high as he could while my other coworker stood on the forks to have a vantage point in which to be able to really get a good look around for the guy, or maybe a car leaving or something. But, he didn't see anything.

Once we got back into the factory and inside the boss's air conditioned office, the boss had something interesting to tell us about the night before. First off, he informed us all that we had no running water in the whole Industrial park. The interesting part came when he explained why there was no water.

Apparently, the night before, a couple guys tried stealing like a big rig or something from one of the businesses located up past us in the park. When they tried to escape with the truck after nearly getting caught, they tried to jump the thing across a small creek where the water main coming into the industrial park happened to be. They of course, didn't make it and they ended up smashing the water main to all the businesses in the park.

I have no real idea if the Intruder amongst the grapevines was related to that incident or not. We did call the sheriff just in case and they came out and took a report and got a description of the intruder from me. Of course, none of the outside security cameras caught it, since it was behind the tree line and amongst the heavy shrubbery. So I guess we'll never know.

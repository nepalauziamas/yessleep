I’ve always had very vivid dreams but nothing quite like what happened to me the other day. While sleeping my mind started spinning and spiraling through a series of horrible nightmares. Nothing out of the ordinary as far as nightmares go, until I start lifting of my bed. 

My chest rising first with my arms and legs limp. I could feel it, I could feel myself lifting off my bed, I open my eyes (or think I do) and there are faces coming out of my ceiling. Faces of demon like shapes, there are no real faces but rather outlines of where facial features should be. Hands start to melt out of the ceiling and I try to look away. My head would not turn but I moved my eye to see more demon creatures coming from the walls and moving towards me. I look back up and see myself being pulled into the ceiling. 

I wake up, in a beautiful field filled with flowers and tall grass. Just as I would start to relax a young girl would appear. Although I am not sure how, she would take over my mind and I could feel what she felt. I wasn’t in her body but rather following her through a path but knowing exactly what she was feeling. She was not someone I recognize or honestly feel like could describe well but this felt like a long time ago. Before phones, and cars. I would start by following her on a path through the grass, she would look back to make sure I was still with her. As if she knew I was there but we never spoke a word. I would see a town and this anxiety would creep in and take over to a point I felt I was seizing in bed. I could feel my body shaking and I could not open my eyes. I would get so close to feeling my breath stop and then then it all stopped and suddenly I would be standing looking at a tall southern oak tree. 

In the tree sitting on a branch was the little girl. She would look my direction but not really at me. I looked over my shoulder and saw a well-dressed man walking her way. She was retaliating against this man. She knew this was her only way out. She wanted him to pay for what he did. She was taunting him, as if she knew this would end her suffering and stop him from hurting her again. She wanted to hurt him as bad as he hurt her. As soon as he was close enough to see her, she made eye contact and jumped. Her face was straight, she did not hesitate, and she did not stop making eye contact. I hadn’t noticed the first time until she jumped but she tied a rope around her neck. This vision came flashing to me over and over all night. Every time I saw it, I felt it. I felt her pain and somehow knew why she did this. She was about 13 and pregnant. This man raped her and was a cult leader or someone of power over her. The young girl knew if it was a boy he would have been raised to be like the well-dressed man. And if it was a girl, she would likely be pregnant at the same age as the young girl. 

Just after the girl would jump, I would wake up, or think I woke up but instead I was being raised to the ceiling again. With more demon-like hands and faces melting out of my walls and ceiling. This went on all night. I feel like I was there, like it was happening to me, but I was always watching. I felt I had this girls mind but not her body.

I'm safe now as I'm typing this, in a car en route to... Well, I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm sorry for the gap. I needed a little bit to process what happened after my tussle with that gun-toting driver. Getting my thoughts together... and my words. God, I'm talking like this was a lifetime ago - it feels like it - but it can only have been - what, 20 minutes tops?

\~\*\~\*\~\*\~

I opened my eyes and found myself staring into the cold dirt. I peeled myself off the ground with a groan, looking back up at the cliffside. It was a sheer 30 foot drop, at least. It was incredible I hadn’t broken anything.

A gurgling sound caused me to whirl around. “Jesus Christ…” I mouthed.

A rusted old signpost stood among the trees – two metal poles barely holding together a rotten wooden sign that had sagged nearly to the ground. The lettering was faded, but I could make out “Welcome to the Rock”. I barely processed the words. Impaled on one of the poles of the sign was my pursuer. He must have fallen directly onto the signpost. And from that height…

The pole went straight through his abdomen. And I mean all the way through. A bloodstain was slowly spreading across his shirt. Soon it would be just like mine. He craned his neck to look around wildly, not seeming to register my presence, before his head fell back onto the earth again.

“Holy shit… Oh God.” My hands were shaking. I nearly dropped my phone in my haste to pull it out. I breathed a sigh of relief to see it was still functional. These cheap TracFones were surprisingly durable. 911, 911…

No reception. Shit. Shit, shit, sh…

The man let out a gasp for air through shredded lungs.

“Someone, help! Anyone!”

My shout echoed through the forest in vain. The town had to be close by – It was a signpost that had caused this. In my panicked state, I didn’t pause to wonder why the sign was all the way out here. The man looked up again, seeming to notice me for the first time. He opened his mouth as though he wanted to say something, but only a wheeze came out – a thin, rattling wheeze.

I could tell he wasn’t long for this world. And so I did the only thing I could, in that moment. I opened my satchel and took out my prayer book, flipping to… What page was it on again? Page 462. Ministration at the Time of… At the Time of Death.

I didn’t know if he was a religious man or not, but it was the only way I knew how to be there for him in his last minutes. I knelt by his side, clasping his hand. The warmth was already starting to drain from it, but he shivered at my touch. My hands must be cold and clammy, the state I was in. I looked down at the book in my hand and began to pray. My voice cracked as I recited the words, but I tried to keep a soothing tone and let it wash over him. Eventually he started to calm, though I didn’t know if he knew what I was even saying at that point.

Finally even the quiet wheezing stopped. His eyes gazed upwards, unseeing. I reached out a shaking finger and gently closed his eyelids. Then I got to my feet, walked a respectful distance away, and emptied the contents of my stomach onto the ground. I retched until there was nothing but a watery bile left.

I caught a glint out of the corner of my eye, coming from a nearby bush. I reached over and parted the foliage to investigate. It was the man’s gun. The barrel gleamed even in the faint light of the forest… almost like the communion chalice at church. I looked back at the- the body, realizing the ammunition pouch was still strapped to his belt.

In hindsight, I shouldn’t have disturbed the scene. I was hardly thinking rationally at the time, though. I knelt by the man’s side once more, this time to examine the torn remains of his pouch. “Silver bullets? What the Hell?”

I knew the old trope, obviously, from horror movies and games. But those were just stories. I wracked my brain to think what real life use one could have for bullets like these. I didn’t know enough about guns to tell.

I got to my feet again. I finally realized that there was a faint sound coming from the top of the clifftop. Luna had been meowing – probably for a while. She must be calling for me. My poor kitty had to be so scared, left all alone. I looked at the cliff and contemplated climbing it. Then I thought better of it. I’d never done anything like that, and I didn’t want to fall and- Well, it didn’t bear thinking about. I decided to take the long way around.

Eventually I returned to the clifftop, Luna still crying out with her meows. “I’m here, I’m here,” I soothed her. “I’m not going to leave you.”

She fell quiet then, and I let out a breath, picking up the carrier. We had both had a hell of a day. At least soon this nightmare would be over and she could stretch her legs – the town was close by, after all. And so I returned to the site of the… incident. I kept walking past the sign this time, until the trees began to part and I found myself on a quiet street with a few houses.

“Ah, my friend. You’ve arrived. We’ve been expecting you.” I turned with a start. Lester Flynch stood before me, looking down at me with those gleaming green eyes of his. His eyes fell to rest on my cat carrier for a moment, but then he looked back at me, smiling broadly. “And I see you’ve brought… an unexpected visitor.”

Luna let out a hiss. I looked at her with surprise. In her nine years of life, I’d never heard this cat do anything like that. Sure, she could be skittish around strangers, but she was always the “flight before fight” type. Flynch bent down to peer into the carrier, smiling at her. “Why, hello there, little cat.”

Luna shrank into the back of the carrier and let out a low – What’s the word? That kind of low “mrrow” that cats make when they’re about to fight?

Before I could comment, he stood back up again. “Well, I certainly didn’t expect you to be taking the scenic route into town!”

“I… got into an accident. Listen, Mr. Flynch-“

“Please. I told you. Call me Lester.”

“All right… Lester. I totaled my car. And then… There was a man, and he…”

He looked at me with concern. “Slow down, take your time. I can see you’ve had a bit of an ordeal. I do hope it doesn’t color your impression of our fair town.”

I shook my head. “What are you doing here, anyway? How did you find me?”

“Mere chance, my friend.” He pointed a short way down the street, where a dark-colored Cadillac was parked. “I happened to be driving past when why, who should stumble out of the woods but our new priest!”

“I haven’t been interviewed yet,” I reminded him.

“Of course, of course. Pardon my presumptuousness. But the others are *dying* to meet you. And you’re just in time, in fact. I was on my way to the church right now. Perhaps I could offer you a ride.”

Accepting a ride hadn’t worked out well for me last time. But as though sensing my unease, he said “I’m sure you wouldn’t want to be late to your interview. Merely a suggestion, of course. If you’d rather walk…”

“No – No, I’ll take you up on your offer. Thank you, M- Lester.”

He got out his keys as we began walking towards his car.

“By the way…” I asked him. “I don’t suppose you have a Tim Hortons in town? I don’t mean to bother you, but I could really use a pick-me-up…”

“The Canadian coffee chain?” He frowned at me. “Nothing so grand as that, I’m afraid. The stores around here only stock Nestle instant coffee.”

I looked at him in horror.

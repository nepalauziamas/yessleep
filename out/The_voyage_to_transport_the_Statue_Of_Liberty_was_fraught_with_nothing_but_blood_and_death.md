My great grandfather was on the ship that transported the Statue Of Liberty from France to America, and he was one of the few people who knows how harrowing that journey actually was. This is the story that has been passed down through our family.

I arrived at the docks early as I knew that the captain would be wanting the ship to leave on time. He had been delighted to be given such an important task as to deliver this statue to the colonies across the ocean.

I reached the ship and climbed up the gang plank and was surprised to see a number of soldiers milling about on board. I gave a questioning look towards one of the other crew and he just shrugged his shoulders in response. The captain came out and started barking orders at everyone as he wanted the ship to get underway. He shot me an annoyed look as we all rushed about trying to get everything in order.

I rushed to my station and had to shove a number of soldiers out of the way in the process. They didn't even seem to acknowledge my existence as they continued standing around, and just overall being in the way.

I let out a sigh as I looked backwards and watched as the shore slowly disappeared from view. The journey was meant to take months and I hoped that my beloved wouldn't forget about me.

I spent the first few weeks of the journey just trying to make sure everything on the ship was working to the best of its ability. I checked the crates thst housed the statue on a daily basis to make sure that they weren't damaged. 

The captain was more relaxed as he trusted his crew to make sure nothing untoward happened. It was evident that he wasn't happy about the soldiers being on board, but he never said anything to them.

I was awoken one night by screams coming from the deck. I jumped out of my bed and rushed over to see what was happening. By the time I had arrived the screams had stopped and there was just a crowd of people standing around looking confused.

There was a pool of blood on the deck which led to the bow of the ship. The bloodstains looked like something or someone had been dragged overboard. We did a quick head count and discovered that one of the soldiers was missing. We did a thorough search of the ship but he was nowhere to be found. The captain ordered everyone not on duty to return to bed. The soldiers didn't look happy about this but they knew better than to argue with him. 

Over the next few nights a few more people disappeared without a trace, and the captain ordered everyone to work in pairs. I was paired with Tomas who had been working on ships for his entire life. He wasn't much of a talker but he was good company as he was someone who always did their share of their work without complaint.

The ship was shrouded in shadows as it was a cloudy night and the moon was nowhere to be seen. I was jumping at every little noise as I was convinced there was someone watching me. 

I was packing away some equipment when I heard a clattering noise behind me. I turned around to see Tomas stumbling towards me. Something about him seemed off and it took me a few seconds to realise what it was. I almost screamed when I spotted that his arm had been ripped off.

Tomas opened his mouth to say something when I spotted a black shape shoot out of the nearest shadow and hit him. He slumped forward and his body collided with the deck. His head rolled forward and landed on my feet. His mouth was still hanging open as if he was still about to speak.

I let out a scream as his blood began spraying out of his corpse towards me. I could hear movement below me as my scream had roused the crew. I stopped breathing when I noticed a pair of red eyes watching me from the nearest shadow. I could feel my bladder release as I knew whatever was in that shadow would kill me without a second thought.

My entire body felt frozen to the deck as the creature slowly advanced on me. I couldn't make out its shape as it kept itself within the shadows. I almost fainted when I heard the deafening report of a gunshot a few feet away. The creature hissed at me and then jumped overboard.

I turned around to discover a number of soldiers standing there with their weapons still at the ready. Their faces were etched in fear and they were looking in all directions, as if expecting another attack.

I was forced to relay what had happened to everyone when they had sll gathered. A few people were doubtful at first but thankfully they believed me when the other soldiers verified what they had seen.

The next night I was shaken awake and told that we had managed to catch one. I hopped out of my bunk and followed the soldier up to the deck. Everyone was clustered around something and I forced my way forward to get a better view.

My mouth hung open as I stared down at a small creature no taller than 3 feet. Its entire body was as black as tar and had almost no evident features apart from its bright red eyes. I was about to get closer when one of the soldiers grabbed my shoulder and pointed down at its hands. I took a quick step back as I realised its arms ended in claws that looked sharp enough to cut through metal. Its arms and legs had been shackled together to keep it from escaping.

The captain marched forward and told everyone to go to sleep as we would decide what to do with it in the morning. I awoke early the next morning and made my way above deck. It was a foggy morning and the sun had yet to appear in the sky. I glanced over at the creature who was very jittery and was being guarded by two of the soldiers. It was trying to reach the nearest shadows but its chains were holding it in place.

I was taking a quick smoke break and watching the sun finally break through the fog. I was shaken out of my daydreaming by ungodly shrieks which were emanating from the creature. Tendrils of smoke began spewing from it's flesh and within seconds it's entire body was aflame.

I reacted without thinking and grabbed a bucket of water and flung it over it, but to no avail. It's body quickly burned down leaving nothing but scorch marks on the deck. No one reacted for a few seconds as we all stood there dumbfounded. One of the soldiers cheered and soon we were all celebrating as the creature that had plagued our journey was now dead.

The captain let the celebration go on for a few minutes before telling everyone to get back to their stations. Everyone walked around with smiles on their faces and even the captain looked happy which was a rarity in itself.

That night I awoke to pure pandemonium as I could hear the unmistakable sounds of gunfire and screams which were then brutally silenced. I rushed towards the sounds and almost went flying after standing in a pool of blood. 

The creatures had returned en masse and were attacking us without mercy. The deck was riddled with the corpses of both species and I felt a tiny bit of me die inside as I saw the captains throat get ripped out. He locked eyes with me for a second before keeling over dead.

I shrunk back as one of the creatures advanced on me. I was unarmed and knew that I was dead unless I did something quickly. I reached out and picked up a lantern and flung it at the creature. The flames instantly consumed its body and it was dead even before its body hit the deck. The survivors around me followed my lead and we used fire to fight off the last of them.

We took stock of how many of us were dead and were horrified to discover that all of the soldiers were dead, and there was only a few of the crew left alive. I was tasked with being the captain as I had the most experience. 

We had an impromptu funeral for the dead before throwing them overboard as we had nowhere else to keep their bodies. I felt terrible about doing this but knew we had no other option. The creatures didn't attack us for the rest of the journey, which was a blessing as we wouldn't have able to fight them off if they did.

I felt relief for the first time in months as I saw the coastline ahead and knew that we had survived this hellish voyage. I often wondered if this statue was worth the blood that had been spilt in order to transport it. Only time will tell.

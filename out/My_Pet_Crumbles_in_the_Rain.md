I stepped out of my tent with a sigh, my shoes squelching in the mud. Last night's unexpected storm definitely put a damper on my camping trip. Too bad I couldn’t tell the weather to give me a break the one week I reserved to escape my stifling life. As I stood there with my hands on my hips, I heard a faint scrambling sound from the area behind me. Curious, I went to take a look, but even after staring for a few minutes, I had no idea what I was looking at.

It appeared to be a creature about the size of a wolf. It must have taken shelter in that small cave during the storm, and now it was trying to avoid the giant puddles in the rocky terrain surrounding it. The creature didn’t seem willing to get wet as it gave up and tried to climb the side of the mountain instead, but the smooth stone wasn’t helpful and it lost its grip, falling and landing with a splash.

With a panicked flail, it jerked itself out of the puddle, and I gawked in stunned confusion at its hind leg. That limb had been the one to land in the puddle, and now it was crumbling. I crawled closer in mystified concern as the creature limped around in distressed circles. Its hind leg had completely disintegrated now, and the areas of its body that got the brunt of the splash were dimpled, just like sand under rain.

The creature tried once again to climb up, and I couldn't help but whisper words of encouragement as I watched in tense anticipation. When it slipped again, I jumped up and ran over without thinking, causing the creature to shrink away and hide in the cave. I put my hands up and hunched down, trying to appear harmless as I surveyed the area for a way I could help. My gaze fell on a thick branch the storm had broken, and I made sure it was completely dry before I dragged it over and placed it across the puddles.

Once I backed away, the creature peeked out of the cave, its head tilted as it looked at what I'd done. With tentative steps, it walked over to the branch and pawed at it, and I smiled as I watched it safely make its way over to dry land. My smile didn't last long, though, when the creature turned to me. It was rather large, and I was within attacking distance. Gulping, I put my hands up and hunched down again, and it gave me one last look before it scurried in the opposite direction.

With a trembling sigh of relief, I shook away my fear and walked back to my tent, my thoughts running wild with questions. What was that creature? Was it really made of sand? Where did it come from? Why was it here? All questions with no answers.

After washing up, I found a sunny spot and sat to have breakfast, but my spoonful of beans froze halfway to my mouth when I glimpsed the creature. It was peeking at me from behind a nearby tree, and I stared in awe as it stepped into the sun. It *was* made of sand, the golden brown grains glinting as they formed the creature’s barrelled body, perked ears, long snout, and big eyes.

It stood still, tense yet curious as its gaze traveled over my tent, my cooler, my water bottle, and my can of beans. I wasn’t about to offer it water or beans, so I unwrapped a jerky stick and tossed it on the ground between us, my heart thudding in nervous anticipation. After a few hesitant seconds, the creature walked closer and pawed at the jerky, but it didn’t sniff or taste it. Perhaps it couldn’t smell or eat, or need to. It was obvious it could see, hear, and feel, though, and that fascinated me. How did this creature function? How did it even exist?

Not sure what to do, yet relatively certain it wasn't going to attack me, I continued eating as I watched the creature inspect the offered jerky. Once it got bored, it limped closer, and I held my breath as it began nudging me with its paws and snout. Sand sprinkled into my beans as it placed its front paws on my shoulder and inspected my head, and I remained perfectly still save for my drumming heart.

Its rough tongue slid across my cheek, and I flinched, grimacing as it felt like sandpaper. Sand trickled down my face, and I wondered if these creatures replenished or if they eventually shed themselves to nothing. As it continued to lick my face, I began noticing a lack of slobber and hot breath. That made sense. If it was made of sand, it wouldn’t have internal fluids or need to breathe. Perhaps it didn't even have lungs, which explained why it was silent, never barking, growling, or whimpering. Did that mean it lacked all other organs? Was it solid sand?

Curiosity getting the best of me, I placed a tentative hand on the creature’s chest and gently pressed. There was no give. The creature stopped licking me, but it didn’t draw back or attack, so I took the chance and slid my hand across its side. The texture reminded me of my childhood days at the beach where we'd make sand castles, compressing the sand tight so it wouldn’t crumble. The creature’s petrichor scent was soothing too. I smiled when I noticed its tail wagging, and I petted it again, letting out a surprised chuckle when it dropped its upper body onto my lap, its joyful tail smacking against my cooler.

Its appearance and mannerisms were very similar to a dog’s, but it wasn’t a dog. Although I’d befriended it, I still had no answers, and I wanted them. I put my sandy can of beans down, and the creature hopped to the side when I made to stand up. After dusting myself off, I grabbed my hiking stick and beckoned the creature to follow me as I went off to explore the area. It didn’t take us long to come across a shallow valley, its golden brown sand identical to the creature’s. 

Fascinated, I walked closer, poking at the ground as I tried to find hidden burrows, and I stopped when I noticed a slow flow towards a dent in the center. It reminded me of sand in the upper part of an hourglass. Curious to know where the sand was falling, I lifted my hiking stick, ready to poke at the hole, but I paused when I glimpsed the creature from the corner of my eye. It hadn’t followed me as it stood on a grassy patch, its teeth bared and body hunched in a silent growl as it scanned the valley.

Its reaction was enough to get me scrambling out of there. The creature definitely was from this area, and it didn’t like it. Perhaps it was dangerous here. Perhaps the creature had run away. It was best to leave.

Despite finding myself with more questions than answers, I walked back to my campsite, the creature tagging along. Sinking into my folding chair, I grabbed a drink from my cooler and chugged it down, wondering if I should call anyone to investigate this mystifying phenomenon. Before I could make a decision, the creature drew me out of my thoughts as it dropped a pine cone at my feet, and I chuckled when it hopped back and ducked down, its tail wagging in anticipation.

The game of fetch that followed was the most fun I’d had in a while, my rusty laughter cathartic. The creature seemed to be having the time of its life as well, running with endless stamina despite the missing leg. It reminded me of my childhood puppy, Growlithe, so I decided to name it Eevee. It matched it. It matched her.

No, I wasn’t going to call anyone. This was something special between Eevee and me. I’d found her when she needed help, and she’d found me when I needed a break from my dry, lonely life. I had a few days left of my camping trip, and I wasn’t going to ruin it for us.

That evening after dinner, I entered my tent and slid into my sleeping bag, smiling as Eevee crawled inside with me. She was heavy and shedding sand everywhere, but I didn’t care as I hugged her, sighing in satisfied warmth. She snuggled in my arms and licked my face, and I chuckled as I winced, telling her to settle down. I had no idea if sand creatures slept, but if Eevee was going to stick around, she had to allow me some nightly rest.

Distant thunder rumbled and Eevee lifted her head, her worried eyes focused on the entrance. I hugged her tighter and told her not to worry, the tent was waterproof and so was the sleeping bag. Lightning lit up the tent a few seconds later, and I calculated that the storm was only a few miles away. Thunder boomed again, but this time there was no lightning. Frowning, I sat up as thunder rumbled once more, and Eevee jumped out of the sleeping bag as the ground shook beneath us.

This time, lightning did flash, and I gasped at the huge, humanoid shadow cast upon the side of the tent. With my pulse racing, I grabbed my gun and flashlight, Eevee snarling as the stranger took another thunderous step towards us. One swipe of its clawed hand left the zippered flap of my tent in tatters, and I screamed as my light illuminated a demonic face of sand, its sulfuric scent flowing in thick.

My useless bullets went straight through the monster as it barged in, its size four times that of Eevee’s as it pinned me inside my sleeping bag, crushing my cell phone. Panicking, I thrashed and screamed as I blindly punched at its limbs, my eyes squeezed shut as noxious sand rained down on me. My manic struggling left my knuckles raw and abraded, but it did nothing to stop the monster from suffocating me beneath its weight.

With sand falling in my nose and mouth, I coughed as I gasped for breath, but I refused to give up as I changed tactics and focused on spitting and clawing. This had to be the monster Eevee was afraid of. Perhaps she even ran away from it, and now it was back. To kill me and to take her. Despite my terror, I was going to do all I could to keep it preoccupied until Eevee finds a safe place to hide.

Thunder exploded above us, and lightning flashed as the tent erupted in the rush of pouring rain. The sound brought with it a drop of hope. With my desperate lungs spasming, I continued spitting, smearing my saliva over every part of the monster I could touch before clawing at it. If I could hurt it enough, perhaps I could wiggle free and lead it outside, letting the rain take care of the rest.

Yet the monster didn’t seem affected no matter how much I spit and scratched, and my tongue was now as dry as Eevee’s as my broken nails bled. My spastic heartbeat echoed in my head as stars danced beneath my eyelids, and my weak arms fell to my side as my strangled breaths croaked.

Tears lined my eyes. I wasn’t going to be able to do it. I was going to die alone, just like I lived. I just hoped Eevee made it somewhere safe before it started to rain. My tears now coated my face, flowing down my cheeks, chin, and hair in a powerful surge as my consciousness teetered. One more breath …

… filled my hungry lungs, jolting my body as I coughed and sputtered. The weight was off me, and I scrambled up in a mixture of confusion and dread. I was drenched, and it wasn’t tears. Eevee had torn the tent apart, a piece of it still in her mouth as she ran, the furious monster running after her. Panicking, I jumped to my feet and rushed after them, ignoring my bruised ribs as I called out for Eevee.

Thunder shook the trees around us as lightning flashed, and I caught a glimpse of the monster stumbling ahead of me, its body shrinking as it disintegrated beneath sheets of unforgiving rain. It fell to the ground, writhing, and I ran past it, my wild eyes searching for Eevee, hoping she’d found a cave to hide in. Thunder overshadowed my hoarse voice, but I stopped calling out to her when lightning revealed a torn scrap of my tent … half buried in a pile of saturated sand.

I fell to my knees, my hopeful heart crushed. She was gone. 

I remained there, my tears melding with the torrential rain until a powerful gust of wind sent the pile airborne. I got to my feet, bracing myself against the gale as I whispered my gratitude to the sand flying around me. We’d only known each other a few hours, yet she didn’t hesitate to sacrifice herself to save my life.

I hurried back to my campsite, pausing only to glare at the mound of sand that was once the monster. Resentment surged within me and I began kicking it, yelling expletives as I scattered the sulfuric sand and watched the manic winds carry it away. After my burst of furious grief, I packed up and rushed to my car. With my tent destroyed, the weather hostile, my safety uncertain, and my heart empty, I was ready to cut my trip short.

After a night of restless dreams, I woke up with a listless sigh and trudged to the kitchen to make some breakfast. Opening the cupboard, I swallowed the lump in my throat when I pulled out my mug with the pine cone design. I wished I had something to remember Eevee by. As I waited for the coffee maker, my melancholy gaze landed on my rolled up sleeping bag, and I sat up. A mission now at hand, I emptied my cooler, dried it out, and shook my sleeping bag over it, filling a tenth of it with Eevee's golden brown grains.

With mournful contemplation, I placed the cooler on my kitchen table, petting the sand as I wondered what I could do with it to honor Eevee. Perhaps I could mix it with clay and create a sculpture. Or mix it with paint and design a mural. Or sprinkle it in my garden and watch her grow through my flowers. All I knew was, I didn’t want to send it to any lab for experiments.

Unable to make up my mind, I closed the cooler, and it remained there all day as I went about my chores, my thoughts and emotions racing each other. After another night of restless dreams, I shambled to the kitchen to make myself some coffee, and I froze when I noticed the cooler was no longer in the center of the table. It was near the edge.

I whipped around, my heart thudding as I reached for a knife. Did someone break in? Did they know what happened to me out in the woods? Did they come in to steal what was left of Eevee?

With my wide eyes still scanning the area, I inched towards the cooler to check its contents, only for me to yelp and jump back when it shook. I stared in fearful bewilderment as it shook again, scratching sounds emanating from within as it jerked across the table, teetered over the edge, and fell to the floor with a crash, the cover flying off.

My wide-eyed unease morphed to elated shock when a small creature trotted out of the cooler. It looked unmistakably like Eevee, only much much smaller and with four intact legs. Was this her? Were her memories intact too? With a rush of eager hope, I crouched down and held my trembling hand out, and the creature didn't hesitate to run over and lick my fingers with its sandpaper tongue. With tears of joy, I laughed as I carried Eevee and hugged her tight, and she snuggled in my arms, sending sand flying with every wag of her tail.

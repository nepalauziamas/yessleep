   The last few days without Damien have been *absolutely* horrible. I never thought I’d be missing my dead brother standing at the foot of my bed every night. I had terrible nightmares every time I tried to sleep after he first disappeared, but it stopped once he started his ‘visits.’ I’d never felt more calm or safe. Now the nightmares are back, and worse than *ever*. More horrifying and real than anything I’ve ever dreamt in my life. 

   The second night after he’d stopped ‘visiting’, I tried so hard to stay up and hopefully catch him. I didn’t realize I’d fallen asleep until I rubbed my eyes and looked to my floor. Some type of black liquid had flooded my room, and I had the worst sense of dread. I didn’t know what to do, but before I could even think of anything, my body was moving off my bed, into the thick black ooze. 

   I tried to stop myself, but it felt like I was walking through molasses, and as I tried my hardest to grab onto something, *anything*, I realized I was walking to my window. Against my will, I opened it, letting the ooze spill out over the side of my house. The next thing I knew I was spilling out with it. I expected to hit the ground, hard. Instead, I was already standing again, this time, knee deep in *hundreds* of corpses. My brothers corpses. Each one depicting a different, but horrifying, cause of death. Burned to a crisp, decapitated, limbs torn from his body, every single bone broken multiple different ways, deep cuts all over him… I couldn’t look away, no matter how badly I wanted to. 

   Then I started to sink. The dead bodies of my brother pulling me down, into… Well I don’t know what, and I did *not* want to find out. I tried climbing out, but all I could grab onto were his decaying bodied. It was hopeless. But i saw him. Damien. He was at the edge of the woods calling my name, crying, but no sound was coming out, and he was just… standing there, waving his arms like a crazy person. I tried to yell for his help, but that thick black liquid started to fill my mouth and lungs. I was choking, suffocating. I was going to die in this nightmare. Was I going to die for real? I had never felt so much panic and fear in my life. But then I heard Damien’s voice for the first time in 5 years; *RILEY WAKE UP!* 

   I was in my bed again, awake, and soaked head to toe. My sheets, my mattress, my pillows; all drenched in sweat. I frantically looked around for any sign of Damien or the black ooze. I saw nothing but the time on my bedside table clock. *6:00am*. I started crying uncontrollably, I just couldn’t help it. Damien was gone again, and I STILL can’t help him. I don’t know why I had that dream, I don’t know why he disappeared again, I don’t know where he went. I just wish he would come back…


  He was my best friend since our parents brought me home. I was 3, and my biological parents had been forced to give up their rights, after all of the horrifying things they let their friends do to me, leading to all 5 of their arrests. I ended up in the foster care system. The Flacs’ were the third family to take me in, but the first to never lay a hand on me. The first to show me love. The first family that *wanted* me to be their daughter. Damien was so happy since the moment they brought me home. It was like him and I knew each other already, because we instantly were inseparable. He treated me like a princess from day 1, as did our mom and dad. I don’t even remember how time had passed so fast but the next thing I knew, I was 15 and he was 20.

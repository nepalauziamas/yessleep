For the record, I don’t need to dumpster dive. I just *love it*. I grew up rich. My great grandparents helped invent some kind of plastic or something so the family ended up wealthy forever. But I got sick of that pampered life real quick. These days, I reject all trappings of wealth and live off the land. I go to thrift stores. I shoplift. But most days you’ll find me dumpster diving. 

Two weeks ago, I found the perfect dumpster. It was one of those massive blue metal monsters stuffed to the point trash was overflowing from the open lid. The dumpster was at the end of a narrow alley and partially hidden by a fire escape. I’m not sure how such a large container even got that far back between buildings. My guess is that it started farther up in the alley and got pushed back for whatever reason and recently got stuck. Well, either stuck or far enough out of the way that the garbage collectors started missing it. That was exactly what I wanted. That’s where you found the good stuff. 

As soon as I walked past the super dumpster, I immediately went down the alley to check it out. Thick swarms of flies hovered over the exposed garbage. I had to wade through a small sea of black trash bags to even reach the dumpster. My boots crunched broken bottles as I peered over the metal rim. The smell was almost a physical force, squirming up my nose and down my throat. I wrapped a handkerchief around my face to dull the worst of the odor. Summer heat came off the dumpster in a shimmer. 

“Perfect,” I whispered.

I consider myself a pilgrim, a breakaway from our crazy, capitalistic society. As such, I am always prepared to harvest what I can from where I can. Sometimes that’s plucking food directly from fields; sometimes it’s cutting out catalytic converters. The day I found the hidden dumpster, I was ready with an empty backpack and an emptier stomach. It’s astounding what some people will throw away. I found–and consumed–three barely eaten apples, an expired KitKat bar, and some recently discarded General Tso’s chicken from the Chinese place around the corner. 

Just as I was stuffing my pack with reclaimed socks and three-quarters of an umbrella, I found the watch. It was shining in the sun caught in between used coffee filters and a pile of dog food. The watch was a Rolex with a gold band and diamonds set in the face. I recognized it as being real immediately. My dad had three just like it. I would never wear a Rolex…but I could pawn it for enough money to spend a week or three in a seedy motel. That would be a nice change from sleeping in the park. 

I slipped the Rolex into my pack and was about to leave when I saw more food. There was a lone strip of jerky on top of a white trash bag next to my ankle. I scooped up the meat, put it in my pocket, and climbed out of the dumpster. The weather was taking a turn; dark clouds spread out like bruises across the sky. I barely made it inside of the pawnshop around the corner before the rain let loose all at once. Thunder followed and lightning began flashing while I was haggling with the store owner, a greedy piece of crap named Jeff. 

While I waited for Jeff to grab my cash, I absently stuck my hand in my pocket and felt the jerky. I wasn’t hungry anymore. In fact, the General Tso’s wasn’t sitting too well in my stomach but I snack when I’m bored, so I took a bite of the jerky. The result was immediate. I stopped hearing the rain and the wind and the storm. The flavor was like nothing I’d experienced in my life. I finished the jery with the next bite. My mouth was already watering for more. I snatched the cash from Jeff’s hand the moment he returned and ran back outside.

It was pouring rain by the time I got back to the dumpster. I had to toss out the first few layers of garbage bags so I could climb inside the container and close the lid above me. There was a moment of total darkness before I turned on my flashlight. As I said, I am always prepared. There was a loud scurrying sound and shifting garbage that I could hear over the drum of rain on the lid. I whipped my light around and saw the biggest rat I’d ever encountered in my life. The animal and I stared at each other for a moment before the rat hissed. I screamed and scrambled back, kicking at the rodent. One of my stray kicks pushed open the dumpster lid. The rat shot out, hissing one last time before the lid slammed closed.

I didn’t lose any time searching for more jerky. I found the next piece, a long strip, under an old hat. Then more and more chunks emerged as I dug into the trash. I ate each piece as soon as I discovered it. The meat was incredible. After stuffing a portion the size of a golf ball into my mouth, I started to choke. I managed to spit the morsel out. Bringing the flashlight close, I poked at the meat with my knife. 

There was a small bone inside the jerky. My guts twisted and I let out a little shriek. But I decided I needed to know, so I kept digging, slower now. My hope was that the meat might be from a fox or raccoon or another animal that got trapped in the dumpster. Then I found the first finger. The first, *clearly human*, finger. I crawled back to the corner of the container. The rain was hitting hard on the lid above me, fast as a machine gun. I threw up and pressed myself into the cool metal for several minutes until my pulse stopped trying to pop my veins. I took a deep breath and went back to moving trash. After a few moments, when I was nearing the bottom of the dumpster, I found the body. 

He was dressed in a suit that would have been nice before all of the garbage and animals picking at it. I couldn’t tell the man’s age. His corpse was decaying, at least a few weeks old. One of his arms was stripped nearly to the bone. I realized that was where my watch and the jerk came from. Scavengers must have been chewing at the body for some time, dragging bits and pieces all around. 

The reason why the dumpster was hidden struck me like a bat against my skull. Someone had disposed of a body inside the bin, covered it with trash, then slid the dumpster farther back in the alley to prevent discovery. People had been dropping their garbage inside the container for weeks until it was overflowing, all helping keep the corpse secret. All that time, the dead guy was inside the dumpster rotting and baking in the summer sun. And we were having a heat wave…

I felt my stomach twist. Part of me wanted to throw up, then run screaming to the police. But another part of me remembered the taste of the jerky. I shone my flashlight where I’d put the full finger. The flesh was dark and withered. It sat in a puddle of garbage juices and rain that was leaking in from above. I picked up the finger and sniffed it, then took a nibble. I hated how good it tasted. I knew it was wrong but I couldn’t resist. 

I took a bite, chewing the meat down to the bone. 

That was three days ago. I’ve been back to the dumpster several times since then and what I didn’t eat on site, I brought back with me. The pawned Rolex gave me enough cash for a nice room at one of the best hotels in town. I’ve had an amazing, *satisfying* past few days. 

However, I know the money will run out eventually. So will the body. The meat. I’m not sure what I’ll do then. I don’t think I can go back to eating beef and pork and chicken, not when there’s much better meat just walking around me every day. 

Oh God...Oh God *oh God oh God oh godgodgodgod*

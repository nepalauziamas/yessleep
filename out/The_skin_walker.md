I was 12 at the time of this taking place In 2013. I was
visiting my cottage on a relatively small lake in northern
Michigan. Me and my mom like visiting this cottage a lot
but we didn't go In awhile so we thought we would go
check up on the cottage, as we arrived we knew
something was different the second we pulled up to the
cottage. We got out and started walking up to the front
steps when our neighbor drove up and said "hey guys
your finally back just be careful their one of those
mountain lions going around and terrorizing people".


We unlocked the house and walked in to a horrible
smell, we searched the house but didn't find anything
"We should check the basement" I said. We pulled up
the cover to the basement and found a animal carcass
that was missing it's skin, it looked like someone or
something used a knife and cut the skin clean off. 


It was about 10pm by now and we were getting ready for
bed when we heard a screeching sound so we went
outside and looked around for a bit, eventually we
found a dead deer so we covered it up with a towel
(because it was right in-front of the house) and went
back inside. 

It was about 2am when I awoke to a loud
sound outside. On my way to the front door I grabbed
our 1911 we keep in the cabin for emergencies, I
walked to the front door and stepped out to the front
step. I was walking to the tree line when I saw it, a
demonic looking deer standing over a dead wolf, it
looked at me and stared with its cold dead eyes. I still
remember to this day the stare it gave me. 

It charged I
raised the gun right as it raised its arm to slash, I pulled
the trigger sending it stumbling back and making it
screech. I ran toward the cabin and into the front door. I
left with my mom the next day and haven't returned
since, that thing changed me it makes me want to go
back and finish it so no one gets hurt or killed. 

I told my
mom what happened that night and she said she heard
rumors about a skin walker being up their but she never
believed it until that night. A couple weeks later my moms friend went up their to see if he could kill the beast so he went up to the cottage. 

A couple nights later we heard that he went up their and called the cops because something was walking around the front door and scratching the windows. At one point he said he thought he heard someone say “it’s ok you can come out” he thought about it but never went out. 

I woke up the next morning and my mom told me that her friend had died last night and the police don’t know how. The police said that they think he died of a heart attack because no marks were on his body. 





That cottage haunts me in my dreams I see that thing staring at me in my dreams if you saw it you would be changed too.

There are comfortable lies we tell ourselves to avoid the everyday horrors of life. Serial killers exist, but not in my neighborhood. Some people die screaming, but I won’t. There is evil in the world, but I’ll know it if I see it. Comfortable lies, but the true comfort is in convincing yourself to believe them. 

Sometimes all it takes is a scary story—something impossible to distract from the true horrors that lurk next door. But sometimes the story, the distraction and the truth are bound together by something that begs for a lie of its own. 

When I was growing up we had a scary story in our neighborhood. There was, and still is as far as I know, a house at the end of Schrader Lane that kids called the Hunger House. It was a nice place, if a bit run down. A big colonial with clapboard siding and paint around the windows that might have been periwinkle at some point. The grass was high along the sloping lawn that flanked its stone front walk and peeking out from it was a For Sale sign that bore my father’s name beneath a faded real estate company logo. 

The house was his white whale; a diamond in the rough with a zirconium price tag. But the story made the place a hard sell. 

By the time I was sixteen and smug enough to question everything, I wondered why it wasn’t called the Hungry House. The story was that the house ate people. Hunger House seemed more like a charity for feeding the poor. Of course it didn’t really matter to me because I didn’t believe the story. There were those who claimed that there were records—proof that the story was true, but I doubt you’d likely find too many sixteen year olds scouring the local courthouse or looking through old news microfiches for support of an urban legend. This was especially true of me. I had just discovered weed and I had a girlfriend and I had never seen evidence of the horrors of the Hunger House, but I had seen Caitlin’s tits. Another less sinister distraction. 

My little brother, Connor, *was* a believer and the unofficial Hunger House lore keeper of our home, much to my father’s dismay. My dad reaped his own harvest with that one though. He and I had watched the Exorcist when I was thirteen while my mom was away for the night. Connor had asked to stay up with us and my dad relented. 

“It’s just a movie,” he’d sighed as Connor settled into the couch between us. He was right. But the consequence of *just a movie* wasn’t a sudden awakening to the sound of Connor’s night terrors. The consequence was a seven year old horror buff. He started watching as much as he could—as much as my parents would allow. And when he found out about the Hunger House, he was absolutely thrilled. 

Caitlin seemed amusedly curious as Connor regaled her with his collected mythos while I made sandwiches in our kitchen. 

“So why does it eat people?” she asked. 

“No one knows for sure, but there’s a story about a family called the Stanbridges that lived there during the Great Depression of 1929,” Connor answered, practically vibrating with dorky, morbid excitement. “They didn’t have enough money to feed their three kids so they starved the youngest so the others could live. Pretty messed up right?”

“Why didn’t the youngest kid just steal food? Or leave?”

“There was a lot of snow that winter. A blizzard. Leaving wasn’t an option, but the stealing part was. So they tied her up—the youngest daughter—in one of the bedrooms.”

“Kinky,” Caitlin quipped. 

The utterance caught my attention and I saw Connor struggling with the flippant dismissal. 

“No. Not *kinky*, scary. They left her there to die alone. Her dad brought her water but he knew the rest of the family would feed her so he locked the door and kept her isolated.”

“*Isolated*…are you sure you aren’t older than ten?”

Connor bristled at her interruption. “The daughter wasn’t. She was eight. And after two weeks the dad found her bones. Just her bones and every one of them covered in teeth marks.”

Caitlin frowned. 

“The house apparently has mouths,” I added. “Lots of them.”  

That was another part of the story that seemed strange, though I did get how dozens of hungry mouths sprouting from the floorboards was more disturbing than a room that just caused flesh to disappear. 

“Weird,” Caitlin said. “And creepy.”

Connor took the victory with a somber nod and we ate lunch as he expounded on the other gruesome stories of residents and squatters and curious teenagers. 

My dad got home as Connor was getting to the Morris kid—one of the more recent stories. He groaned and I groaned in silence with him. My dad hated Connor’s story time and I hated that Caitlin and I had squandered third base time for it. 

“Caitlin, sweetie, whatever spooky BS my son is telling you—it’s all make believe. That house is fine, it’s in remarkable shape for the time it’s been empty, it has most of the original woodwork, great light, and because of this absurd story, it’s a pariah. Ridiculous.”  My dad grabbed my sandwich and took a bite. “Did Connor tell you he’s been in that house half a dozen times?  He’s only been eaten once, maybe twice.”

Caitlin laughed. I chuckled, and Connor fumed. 

“I’ve never spent the night,” he shot back. “The house only takes you if you spend the night.  That’s what the Blood Sponge Bed is for.”  

“I’m sorry—the *blood sponge bed*?” Caitlin asked. 

“There’s a bed in one of the bedrooms that’s like a *magic* altar for human sacrifice,” I snarked. “The magical thing about it though is that no matter how many people get eaten on it, it soaks up the blood like a sponge and always looks *magically* not-bloody.”

“It’s an antique oak bed from the late 1800s,” my dad soberly explained while cracking a beer. “It conveys with the house. Absolutely gorgeous details. And no blood.”

My dad was always seemingly trying to sell the house even to a pair of teenagers. Perhaps it was his way of counteracting the lore or perhaps he was just a consummate salesman. 

“Why don’t you buy it, Mr. Keating?” She asked, stroking my ankle with her foot beneath the dining table. 

“Caitlin, if I had been my agent when I was looking sixteen years ago, I probably would have. Sadly, I’ve got a home equity loan to pay for the deck—it’s like a ball and chain tethered to the value of the house—“

I interrupted him with a curt, “*Dad*.  Old people stuff seems awesome, truly, but Caitlin and I—we have a project for school.”

He feigned being wounded by the news and gave Caitlin a crestfallen look. 

She shrugged and smiled apologetically. 

“Fine,” he said finally. “But that door better be open when your mom gets home.”

“Yeah, dad.”

My dad probably put on a television show and dipped into his beer. For all I know, Connor spent the next few hours writing speculative fan fiction about the Hunger House. I went upstairs and made out with Caitlin and about ten minutes in, she stopped and looked very serious all of the sudden. 

“I think I might have a surprise for you. But I’ve gotta think about it.” She ended the thought with a smirk and my sixteen year old mind went wild with speculative fiction of my own. 

Caitlin and I had been dating for eight months. We had been playing fumbling teenage cat and mouse for a little over a year prior. I felt like I knew her so well with a kind of moronic youthful certainty, but she was spontaneous in a way that I found endlessly intriguing. 

I wasn’t expecting it, for example, when she circled back to the Hunger House as we took a break from vigorous dry humping.  She asked about Jack Morris—the Morris kid—and I gave an exaggerated sigh. 

“No seriously, I’m curious. Do you know the story?”

“It’s gonna kill the mood…”

 “No it won’t, and even if it does, we’ll revive it.”  She smiled flirtatiously and I hoped she was right. 

Jack Morris died when I was four. It’s not something I really remember first hand, but it was a close enough event to my generational interest that I knew most of the versions of the story. My dad’s version involves a kid with mental issues who killed and ate a deer in the house and another kid who ran away. Connor’s version was more grizzly, so that’s the one I told. 

Jack went to the Hunger House with his friend, Kyle Rutledge on a dare. They knew about the house and the friends that dared them knew the legend. I like to think that no one believed it. They spent the night in the house and the next morning one of those friends went to check on them. 

They found Kyle, bleeding from a wound on his arm that would later require an amputation.  He had bite marks on his leg and shoulder, bloody circles that spoke of something horrible. And they had to speak for Kyle; he wouldn’t talk about what had done it, he just shook and sweated and stared out of windows until eventually he found one high enough to end the fear for good. 

He had seen what happened to Jack and all they found of him were bones, some cracked open and missing marrow, others just displaced from a boy who probably didn’t believe. 

It did kill the mood that day. Connor had told and retold that story to me a dozen times. I was bound to be good at reciting it. 

Caitlin looked hesitant and sorrowful. “So they didn’t catch who did it?”

“I dunno. I don’t think so.”

“You think it was one of the friends?”

“Maybe. Honestly I’ve never really thought about it too much.”

“What does Connor think?”

I chuckled in spite of the dour vibe. “He told me once that the house is like a pitcher plant. It searches out victims through its legend, like nectar for hungry stupid flies. He’s a weird kid.”

She agreed, but also added that he might be a genius. He certainly was precocious and he did love to read. Maybe he was. 

——

A few days passed before Caitlin talked about the Hunger House again. We stayed after school for practice on a play that we were in, some modernized take on Shakespeare that was really just an excuse to socialize unathletically. We were talking in the left wing of the stage as we waited for my decidedly more athletic friend Evan to finish with track so we all could drive somewhere and get stoned. 

“So, if your dad’s selling the house, he’s got keys, right?” Caitlin asked. 

“Yeah. I mean I guess.”

“Could you get them without him noticing?”

“If I can find them…but look, there’s really nothing interesting in there. It’s mostly empty.”

“Mostly. But there’s—“ Caitlin checked around us for other people and finding none, whispered, “I think I wanna have sex. I’m ready and—“

I honestly don’t remember the rest of her statement after my mind lost itself to hormonal static. Something about the bed, though I think she probably left ‘blood sponge’ out of her description. 

“So?”

“Uh-huh. I’ll find the keys.”

She smirked and tugged at the front of my shirt. “Good.”

It turned out that finding the keys was easy. My dad had a cabinet in the laundry room. The keys had addresses on them. I borrowed the key and with some assistance from my gallant chauffeur Evan, I made a copy at the hardware store. But the process made me wonder how exactly Jack Morris and Kyle Rutledge had gotten into the place 12 years prior. They weren’t the only recent group of kids to have a strange foray with the house, either. 

When I was fourteen, a girl named Melissa *something* said that she went to the house with two friends and spent the night there drinking and playing with a Ouija board. She said that something bad had happened, that there were demons in the house. The friends she went with—a couple from the other end of the county—were never seen again. 

The problem was that all of them were eighteen. An adult couple running away together just seemed like an elopement or something similar. But Melissa insisted on some vague horrific event without getting into any details. After her night in the house, she had a missing chunk of flesh on her arm or her leg, but she also had a long tally of old scars from a history of cutting. It all added up to something spooky, explainable as something unfortunate but normal. 

But I was curious about the logistics of getting into a locked house, so I asked Connor. He seemed hesitant, a consequence of my tendency to wind him up into lengthy monologues on his urban legends only to turn them into some kind of joke at his expense. I tried to seem earnest. 

“Connor, I’m not trying to fuck with you. I genuinely wanna know.  The house is for sale. It stays locked. And it’s been forever since dad talked about a broken window over there.”

He eyed me suspiciously, but relented. “People respect what the house can do too much to damage it.”

“Okay, so…”

“They say there’s a butler. Not a person really, but a part of the house. Some people think he’s a ghost but I don’t think the house is haunted. It’s hungry, so it lets people in. It wants them to come in.”

“I’ve never heard of a butler in the stories people tell,” I said. 

“Well, he’s a metaphor.”  

I smirked. Connor really did have a lot of big words for a ten year old. 

“But sometimes,” he continued, “you can see him—his effect. There’s a light inside the house. I saw it once at night.”

I had never paid much attention to the Hunger House unless my dad was bemoaning its vacancy. I had certainly never gone down Schrader Lane at night to see it. The street curved, ending at a cul-de-sac and the House was flanked by a youngish widow, Ms. Donavan and the Bensons, a childless couple who were friends with my parents. 

I digested the notion of a predatory house and the fact that Connor had fully accepted the abstract concept. 

“Where do you get all this stuff from?” I asked. 

Connor shrugged. “Dad mostly.”

“Dad? He hates these stories.”

“Yeah maybe. But he knows I don’t.”

I pondered that quietly for the better part of a minute. The stories got in the way of a sale that perpetually eluded my dad. But it seemed he was using them as a bridge. It made me smile, and then had another thought. 

“Wait, why did you go down there at night?” I asked. 

Connor shrugged again. “Mom was working and dad went over to see Ms. Donavan.”

“At night?”

“Yeah. She called the house I think. Or maybe he called her and then went over.  I wanted to see if they were outside, but then I saw the butler’s light and got scared.”

At sixteen, I’d seen enough movies to know about affairs but I made excuses for my dad in the moment. He loved my mom, and despite her long hours, she loved him. They were fine, they loved us, and I was happy to be oblivious. 

I forgot about the drama of our neighborhood in the coming days as I concocted drama of my own. 

I told my parents I’d be staying with Evan on Friday night. It wasn’t abnormal and they didn’t ask questions. As Caitlin was in the process of telling her parents a similar story, I decided to check my key copy after school. It worked fine and as I ventured into the house, I began to appreciate the details my dad was always touting. The house was old—it looked old—but it was also clean.  And to my surprise, the bed was made up with two pillows and white linens. It was comfortable; enough to be romantic, I guessed, in a room that looked grand even in the absence of other furnishings. 

Friday evening, Caitlin came over for dinner and the two of us ate quietly as my dad asked Connor about school. Connor shoehorned some story he had read online about a creepy staircase in the woods into an explanation about deciduous trees. It was very him. And then, as we were finishing our food, my dad introduced a bit of disruptive logic. 

“So Caitlin, whenever you’re ready to go, lemme know and I’ll drive you home.”

*Fuck*. This wrinkle was so obvious, but I hadn’t considered it. Caitlin didn’t have a car. My dad was miserably sober. My mind hastily searched for a solution and then—

“Oh. Thanks Mr. Keating. But I’m actually going over to Darcy Childress’ place after this. She’s not far from here.” 

Clever. Conniving really. She smiled. “The food was really good by the way. Ben’s always saying how good your waffles are but you make a great Carbonara too.”

“He does, does he?” My dad asked, shooting me a glance as he went for the fridge. “Well, maybe tomorrow morning you and Darcy could drop by and learn about my famous waffles first hand.”

“Darcy’s off carbs, I think,” she responded But I’d love to come back by if it’s not too much trouble.”

*Fuck!* I stared at Caitlin, awed and bewildered. Had she planned all of this, or was she just a truly fantastic liar?

My dad cracked a beer and smiled back. “You’re in for a real treat, Caitlin.”

“Can’t wait,” she replied, giggling as she grazed my leg with her hand. 

I volunteered to ‘walk Caitlin to Darcy’s’ and checked my overnight bag. Condoms, clothes and a box of candles my mom saved for power outages. I almost forgot the key in the giddy rush to leave. But I didn’t. And as we walked up the street, I tried to steer my mind away from something that needled it. I was a virgin. Caitlin wasn’t. 

I’d asked her once what her number was and she just looked at me. Finally she had said, “I’m not easy.”  I knew that, but two years prior, the school had a different opinion. A popular girl in my year named Trisha had broken up with her boyfriend, a popular guy named Dan. One of Trisha’s minions had caught Caitlin doing something with Dan in one of the bathrooms at school. She took a picture. Then Trisha sent it around and people turned their backs on Caitlin. I had seen the picture too. 

My friend Evan offered terse wisdom on the matter when I took an interest in Caitlin. “People fuck.”  He was right. I knew it didn’t matter. I hoped it wouldn’t matter. 

As we rounded the final curve of Schrader Lane, I stopped. Any petty thoughts I had been thinking evaporated. 

“I thought the house was empty,” Caitlin said. 

I swallowed in silent agreement and watched a light move inside the downstairs windows. 

I hadn’t told Caitlin about the butler and a part of me thought that the light Connor had seen before must’ve been my dad. But my dad was home. And both the Bensons’ lights and Ms. Donavan’s lights were on. They were home too. 

The light in the Hunger House blinked out. I suggested we wait in the shadow of a patch of trees that divided the house from the Bensons’ place. The act of sneaking and spying was actually kind of exhilarating. 

Caitlin asked, “who do you think it is?”

“I don’t know. You wanna bail?”

She grinned.  “And end our stake out? Not a chance.”

We waited for what felt like a long while, whispering conspiratorially and trying not to laugh. Finally a figure emerged from the back of the house. It stuck to the tree line, moved swiftly and then disappeared. 

“Well that’s not weird,” Caitlin whispered sarcastically. 

“You think they’ll come back?” I asked. 

Caitlin shrugged. “We’ll lock the doors. Probably just some kid who found an open one.”

I hoped she was right, but the excitement of the moment dissolved all but a scrap of my caution. We made our way in and I checked the locks as Caitlin milled around the first floor. 

“Your dad wasn’t kidding, this place is kinda fancy.”

It was. Not particularly creepy apart from the near silence of everything. But silence was good I supposed. It meant we were alone. I turned around from the door to the back yard and saw that *I* was alone. Caitlin wasn’t there. 

“Caitlin?”

A moment later I heard footsteps on the stairs. I followed them, ascended, and about halfway up, draped over the railing, I found a t-shirt. Down the upstairs hall, a bra. In the master bedroom, Caitlin. 

“So…”

My feet bumped a skirt and a pair of underwear at the threshold. I had no good response. So I said nothing as I crossed the monumental distance between us. 

Afterward, we lay in the blood sponge bed. The sheets were soft and when Caitlin eventually asked, “so, do you wanna do it again?”  I had a perfect response. 

“Yeah.”

After that, everything we did kinda rolled together into an ebb and flow. Until Caitlin did something expectedly unexpected. The handcuffs she pulled from an overnight bag felt like pulling the training wheels off a bike mid-ride.  But she grinned as she held them. 

“I saw a video a while back and—I don’t know—it seemed hot. Too much?”

“Uh—I mean—“ I once again was at a loss. 

“They’re for me, not you,” she said. “Just a little—you know—*kinky*.”

Coming from her lips again, the word itself seemed as charged as the kind of activity it implied. 

“Oh,” I responded. It was a lot so soon but as the handcuffs jingled, I discovered a Pavlovian response to a thing I had never truly considered. It didn’t take long for my brain to adjust to the idea. And it was hot. 

And tiring.

I remember thinking it strange that I suddenly felt so beat and then a few moments later I felt…nothing. 

The next thing I remembered was the unfiltered light of morning through bare windows. I felt uneasy. Everything felt wet. I opened my eyes and…everything *looked* red. Caitlin was gone. The handcuffs dangled from a spindle on the headboard. 

“C-Caitlin?”

Nothing. The bed was drenched in what looked like blood. I pulled on my shorts and saw her skirt still crumpled on the ground. 

“Caitlin!” 

I searched around the bed frantically, looked under it, bolted backward. Nausea prickled my tongue and then it stabbed at my gut. *She was—no*—the stories had all spoken of bones picked clean, but what I saw beneath the bed was a face I knew and a thicket of bloody ribs and a ruined body scattered In fleshy clumps across the floor. Her eyes were open, dull, and I tried to blink away its lifeless familiarity.

I vomited. Ran from the room and caught myself in a hall mirror, bare chested and painted with blood in an uneven swath of my left side. I knew I couldn’t go home like that. *I couldn’t go home like that. I couldn’t. I couldn’t go home. I couldn’t go. Could I?* Caitlin was—I didn’t want to think about it and I ended up walking circles around the first floor in a daze. 

*I can’t. I can’t.* 

It was all I could manage to think. I needed something—someone. I called Evan. We had been friends since first grade. He’d help. He’d know what to do. He’d tell me I was crazy, hallucinating, and he’d be right. Wouldn’t he?  

The phone rang. He picked up, sounding groggy. 

“Morning Romeo. Lemme guess. You didn’t—“

“Evan…I—the Hunger House is—it’s—something really bad happened I think.”

“Bro, whoa, you sound fucking rough—what happened?”

I told him what I’d seen. I think my tone carried across my sincerity as unbelievable as the story was. He told me to clean up and get out. 

“I can't just leave her. She’s not right now. There was so much blood and—and—“ The thought of her turned my stomach again and I ran to the kitchen sink. Evan was there on the line when I got back to my phone. 

“Ben, you can’t stay. You were the only one with her. Think about that. I know this sucks and it’s fucking shitty, but do you think the police are gonna believe you when you say a house ate your girlfriend?”

*Fuck…*

“Look. I love you, man. I do. And if you don’t go, you’re gonna go to jail. And for what?”

I pictured a dozen different scenarios after the phone call. In some, the police listened to me, saw how scared I was and believed me. But ultimately, those fantasies seemed as far fetched as the legend of the Hunger House had to me before I knew it was true. My dad didn’t believe the legend and a part of me—a growing part—knew that he wouldn’t believe me either.

I used Caitlin’s t-shirt to mop the blood off of me as best I could.  The blood was sticky though; it only smudged under the dry fabric so I tried the kitchen sink. The water sputtered and ran a murky brown into an acrid pool of vomit. I winced and tried, but it wasn’t enough. To shower, I’d need to go back upstairs. Near the blood sponge bed. Near her. 

The trudge was slow. The shower smelled of sulfur—an unpleasant feature of the home that my dad often extolled as *European*.  But the water was warm. My head cleared some and the terrible weight of Caitlin’s death—of the finality of it—caught up with me. And by the time I left the house, I looked clean but felt heavy. 

Evan was waiting for me in his Honda. He drove. I tried not to cry. 

During my despondency, Evan talked. Maybe he knew to fill the silence so my mind wouldn’t. He was good like that. But eventually he returned to the subject of the house. 

“We’ll have to go back,” he said, staring up the road alongside me. “You had sex. You used condoms. When they find her they’ll find—you know—*DNA*.” 

His practicality made me feel hollow. It was all so fucking wrong. But I sighed my assent. 

“What about Darcy?” he added. “You think Caitlin told her that she’d be with you?”

“No. Caitlin hates Darcy. She just happened to live nearby, so—fuck, Evan. She didn’t have friends. Not really. Trisha’s drama, it—“

“Trisha’s a cunt. Caitlin was good people. And the only thing that picture showed was that Dan Carter has a small dick.” Evan paused. I didn’t have the humor for his jab. “She was though, good people I mean. You two were good together.”

I didn’t respond. I couldn’t. She didn’t die of some disease or in a car crash. She died brutally and I…slept. 

As we returned to my neighborhood that afternoon, Evan asked me if I was okay. I didn’t lie. He frowned. 

“Ben, if you want I can go in and fix things.”

I wanted to let him, but she was my girlfriend. It was our relationship that had put her in that house, my incredulity that let her stay.

“No. I need to go.”  

The house seemed sinister as I returned, its ornamentation manipulative, sadistic. I walked up the stairs, started down the hall and—her bra was gone. So was her skirt. I entered the bedroom hesitantly and saw a comfortable bed.  Two pillows. White linens. No blood. 

It took me a while to look under the bed, but when I did, I saw a haunting space, but an empty one. I didn’t understand. Maybe I didn’t want to. 

——

In the coming weeks, I meandered through bouts of dull grief and sharp anxiety. I smoked pot whenever I had the energy to disappear. But my mood seemed, to outsiders, to follow a simple tragedy rather than the horrific truth I kept. Caitlin became a missing person. The police talked to Darcy. They talked to me. They talked to Evan who told them about picking me up that night as we watched Caitlin waiting by the road. A lie. The trail went cold from there. And then one night, Evan went out for a drive alone and didn’t come back. They found his car at the end of Schrader Lane. 

My dad broke the news. He kept Connor and his speculation far away from me. But I knew the truth. Caitlin’s death—her disappearance—had burdened Evan and my shock that day had made him curious. He started talking to Connor about the house, started doing research of his own. 

A week before Evan vanished, he told me he had found a newspaper article from 1935. It was about the Stanbridges—the family that had started the legend of the Hunger House. There *was* a blizzard that year and the family *did* have three children, but they hadn’t starved their youngest daughter. They had eaten her. Evan had seemed so unsettled as he told me the story. When he got to the end, I understood why. 

The Stanbridges were wealthy. They had plenty of food. They weren’t starving but had eaten their child anyway. “Why would they do it?” he’d asked. “It just seems…*evil*.”  Evan reckoned that there might be something to the story of Melissa and the missing couple from two years before. She had said that there were demons in the house. Maybe there were. 

My mom told me once that people do things for plenty of reasons that the rest of us will never understand. She’s an ER nurse, one who has witnessed what she calls ‘the indelible bruises of hard living.’  More than a few times she had spoken of addiction, of mental illness, of all the little invisible things that slowly rob a person of their humanity. Maybe something invisible had robbed the Stanbridges of theirs. 

Or maybe both notions are true. Maybe humanity is the flesh that makes us good and tempers an evil below. Maybe a house can strip that bare. 

Maybe. But there were no answers for me, no philosophical salves that healed the absence of the people I loved. There was only a curving road with a vacancy at its end; an empty house full of horrid tales. 

The Hunger House fed my nightmares for months. Nightmares of screams in the dark and terror stricken faces and torn flesh. Sometimes I dreamt of Caitlin and Evan. Other times it was just people, it was moving lights in open windows, it was locked doors and shadows in the trees. It was the fabric of legend. The nectar of a pitcher plant waiting to yawn open for the next hapless fly. 

But I didn’t speak of what I’d seen. Not for years. Not until my little brother abandoned his fascination with stories of fear for skepticism. He was growing up, abandoning the lore of dark places for a flashlight and a head full of certainty. It was probably inevitable that the Hunger House would become a target of his growing desire to disprove. And when he told me of his plan to go, I told him a story. 

“Sounds like you just need therapy,” he’d said when I finished. I had been that smug once. 

“Just don’t go. You don’t understand. There’s more to it than some fucking story, Connor.”

“You used to make fun of me for believing. Now that I don’t you’re—what?—salty that it has to end?”

I felt frustration rising in me. “I lost my two best friends. They died badly, okay?”

“Oh…You’re *lonely*. Wait, am I your bestie then? Real talk.  That’s kinda sad.”

“Fuck you.”

He smirked. “Look, I’ve got subscribers. People who watch me because they wanna know how boring the world really is. But I think you know about that already, don’t you? Too sad for a girlfriend. Too boring for friends that don’t share your DNA.”

He was growing up, weaponizing his intelligence in some insufferable teenage rebellion against the person he used to be. But he understood so little. 

“Feel how you want about me, Connor,” I sighed. “Yes, I don’t have friends. I *am* sad. I *am* fucking boring. And all of that has everything to do with the Hunger House. So don’t go. Please.”

He laughed and that night he gathered his camera and his notes and walked down Schrader Lane for the last time. He didn’t post his video, didn’t edit it, but I saw it. My dad brought it home and told me to erase it but I didn’t. It showed the truth in all its bloody, unvarnished detail. And maybe I needed to reckon with that. 

His video began like most of the others. 

CONNOR: Hey Night Lighters. I’m here at 413 Schrader Lane, a place that locals call *The Hunger House.*  That house right in back of me. Pretty spooky right? Anyway, this one’s an easy one to debunk. The legend says if you spend the night here, the house eats you, so I’m gonna spend the night. Note: add color on the house, maybe one of the stories. Not the Stanbridge one though. 

CONNOR: Okay, so it’s 11 pm and I’m chilling on a bed in the house called the blood sponge bed. Long story, but basically this was supposed to be the bed where a family called the Stanbridges tied up their daughter in the thirties and starved her to death. I’d cue ghost sounds but surprise surprise, it’s just a bed. Pretty comfy though. 

CONNOR: It’s midnight, the witching hour. I’ve been here for ehh…three hours and the only scary thing so far is how good I am at Candy Crush. Lemme know in the comments if you’d like me to start live streaming my iPhone games! …That was a joke. By the way. Fuck. Note: maybe cut that. 

CONNOR: Uh, okay, I’m whispering because I hear footsteps downstairs. A few of them. It’s about 1:30 in the morning. Probably kids drinking then, but I’m gonna go down and see what *lurks in the shadows* or whatever the fuck. If I don’t come back, I was probably eaten. And I’m, *like, so scared*…that I’ll be a culinary disappointment. 

CONNOR: Okay. No creeps, no ghosts, no monsters. What you see here is a Coleman camping lantern. It’s not mine. It wasn’t here when I came in. But it may be important to a minor legend related to the house. The legend of the butler. Note: color on the butler. *A legend so unbelievable it needs another legend just to get people in the door*. Something like that. Actually, not bad. Huh. 

CONNOR: So, I can hear something behind this door—voices. It’s on the side of the stairs, so—I don’t know—basement probably. Anyway, I’m gonna go down and see what there is to see. Who knows—maybe I’ll score a beer in the process. 

CONNOR: What the fuck. I was—I was wrong. There’s a guy.  A fucking dead guy dangling from—oh shit, he’s—he’s missing so many parts. Fuck. Someone else is coming. Two people—wait—Ms. Donavan?  My fucking parents? Why are they here? What are they—

ME: Connor? 

CONNOR: Fuck, Ben. You scared the shit out of me. What’s going on? Who is that guy and why—

ME: Connor, I told you not to come… I told you you didn’t understand. 

CONNOR: Who is that guy, Ben?  What happened to him? Did you—

ME: You don’t understand.

CONNOR: Oh my god. You killed him, didn’t you? You—you’re all fucking murderers. 

ME: No. We’re all just *hungry*. I—I told you not to come.

There are comfortable lies we tell ourselves to avoid the everyday horrors of life.  I’ve told myself so many since Caitlin’s death. That the memories were all just nightmares. That my mother’s most threadbare patients would have died soon enough with or without us. That we weren’t selfish just for being hungry. 

I’ve lied to you too. I’m sorry. But some truths are difficult to acknowledge. 

The survivors of the Hunger House have always been the ones who ate the fastest, who felt the hunger strongest. My parents' friends, the Walters, weren’t hungry enough. They disappeared almost twenty years ago after a drunken couples night spent in a house my dad had recently been tasked with selling. Ms. Donavan’s husband went missing and was declared dead five years later. They were young, adventurous…trespassers. Dozens of other people have spent a night in the Hunger House and never gotten a tale. They bleed out. They die. They get cleaned up by hungry mouths that smile in a neighborly way and secretly whisper scary stories that seem impossible. 

The truth is, the Hunger House doesn’t have hunger. It creates it. A hunger that bites at your belly and gnaws at your restraint. The house does feed us though, and in return we [feed the lore and wait](https://www.reddit.com/r/decogent/comments/v85m4g/you_found_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

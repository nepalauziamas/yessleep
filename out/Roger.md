My mom has been acting very weird lately, ever since she went on a blind date. She and dad got divorced a few years ago and her friends tried to talk her into dating ever since. Mom always said she was fine... she had to focus on taking care of me. I'm Peter, her son. I turn 12 in a couple of weeks and for the longest time, I agreed with them.

Mom's really lonely; I hear her crying at night. I don't like to hear her cry. If dating someone would make her happy... then why not? I told her it might be a good idea too. I wish I had kept my mouth shut.

Mom went out on a date with a guy named Roger. Roger is weird. Sure he comes off as nice and was polite to me, but there was something weird in his eyes. You know those nature shows they make you watch in school... where the tiger is hunting the monkeys in the forest and the camera zooms in and you see cold, dark, dead eyes right before the tiger kills the poor monkey? Roger has those eyes.

Mom went on her date and came back happy. Mom hasn't been happy in a long time. I thought that must have meant Roger was a nice guy.

They went on a couple more dates and then Mom spent the weekend at his place. I was stuck home alone for three days while Mom was off... somewhere. She wouldn't tell me where she was going; she actually got mad when I asked.

"I like Roger and you're not going to mess this up for me, Peter, so shut up and mind  your own damn business."

Mom actually yelled at me; mom never yells. That should have been the first warning that something was wrong. I called my Aunt Jen about it but she agreed with Mom so I just dropped it.

Mom left Friday morning and I did my homework and then watched tv. Saturday I figured I'd hear from her but no... nothing. I sent her a text to see if she was ok but she ignored it. Sunday comes and I figure she'll be home soon because she has to go to work on Monday... but no, nothing.

I wake up Monday morning and run to Mom's room to look for her but she wasn't there. Her bed was still made up and there were no dirty clothes on the floor. I checked the rest of the apartment... no Mom. I called Aunt Jen again and finally, this bothered her.

"What do you mean she's not there? Did you call her?"

I told my Aunt Jen that mom was ignoring my calls and texts... I only sent the one but hey, I'm a kid. Aunt Jen growled into the phone and said she'd come check on me after she called the police. I gathered my books and headed off to school.

When I got home that afternoon, I saw Aunt Jen there along with a couple of police cars. Was Mom hurt? I ran inside and saw a very angry Aunt Jen talking to my Mom and a couple of officers.

"There you are. What the hell were you thinking scaring me like that?! You said your mother wasn't home and hadn't talked to you all weekend, Peter. I called the cops because of you."

I looked at my Aunt Jen confused. I told her that Mom hadn't been home and had left me all alone and ignored me and this just made her more angry.

"Don't lie to me you little shit. Your mom said she's been here this whole time. You fucked with my life and my job. I lost a day of work today because of you and filed a false police report. Don't fuck with me like this again you little asshole."

She stormed off and I turned to look over at my Mom to see her smiling. Why was she smiling when everyone seemed angry. I started to walk over and ask her what's going on when I noticed something. The light from the window hit her face and for a moment... her eyes changed. She has bright blue eyes but when the light hit her just right... they turned black and dead... like Roger's eyes.

"I'm sure it's all just some teenage rebellion. I'm so sorry you had to go through all of this officers."

I blinked in shock. Mom sounded so different. She was talking to the cops in a way she never did before... and her voice sounded fake. The police nodded, gave me dirty looks, then left. As soon as they left, Mom's face darkened and she gave me a very evil smile.

"Go do your homework and wash up. Roger is coming for dinner."

I looked at her face and just nodded then headed to my room. That was a couple of hours ago. That's not my Mom.

She yelled for me to get ready because Roger would be here soon. She said he's going to be a much bigger part of our lives from now on and he has a surprise for us... a family vacation I'm sure to just love. I don't think I'm going to live through this night.

If anyone finds this and I'm acting weird... someone do something.. please. Arrest them... lock them up... I don't know. Just do something.

I have to go... Roger just got here.

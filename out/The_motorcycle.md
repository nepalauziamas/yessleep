One hot summer day near Northern California, a friend and I were driving to a party that was happening about two and a half hours away from where we lived. We knew the party hosts, so we were heading there early afternoon to hang out and help set up. 

We were just cruising down the highway with the AC pumping, as it was over 100 degrees that day. As I leaned forward and broke my highway induced trance to turn on the radio, I happened to look up and noticed that we had caught up to a couple of motorcycles. A guy was riding his own bike with a woman on her own as well, cruising a little ways behind him. 

My friend was from New York and super used to bumper-to-bumper traffic, so when I noticed that he was driving a little too close to the bikes, I spoke up and warned him to give motorcycles extra space because you just never know what could happen. Rolling his eyes, he did back off. 

As I continued to absentmindedly watch the two motorcyclists, I suddenly took notice of the woman's bike directly in front of us. I had started to see what looked like the faintest hint of smoke coming from her rear wheel. As I leaned forward and looked closer, the smoke began to get thicker and more obvious. 

Then all of a sudden, her back tire began to wobble! A little at first, then the wheel really started to wobble bad! 

The events that were to follow took a few seconds, but that few seconds seemed to just stretch on and on. I watched helplessly as her rear wheel began to wobble out of control! The smoking and wobbling rear wheel caused her to start losing control of the heavy bike. 

Then, the rear wheel just locked up. That caused the front of the bike to swerve out of control. Her front wheel then jerked to the left causing her to completely lose her balance on the bike. 

Because she was riding at about 60 miles per hour, that loss of control completely threw her off her bike! I watched in horror as her bike went sideways in the lane and tipped over, going right out from underneath her legs. 

As the powerful, still speeding motorcycle turned and fell out from beneath her legs, she clung to the handlebars until she was almost doing a handstand on the bike. Her stick straight arms started to twist, opposite of her lower body. That twisting motion finally forced her to release the handlebars. 

I remember watching the giant bike fall and glint off the sun on the bikes chrome, blinding me for a Split Second. As my vision faded back in though, I watched the woman do a back flip and twist midair. Then she hit the hot blacktop head first and did another final spin before her limp and unconscious body toppled over onto the blacktop. 

Thankfully, she had a full face helmet on, but no leathers. The woman was only wearing a tank top and jeans, probably due to the heat that day. I knew that when she woke up, she was going to be in serious pain from the road burn alone. 

We stopped immediately to help. It was then that I remembered there'd been a man riding in front of her, but slightly ahead of her, so he must not have realized right away when it happened over his loud bike. 

Of course, we and some other people who had stopped, called 911 right away. A few seconds later, her riding buddy came back for her. He hastily parked his bike, then ran over to her in a panic. A couple bystanders shouted for him to not touch or move her. I spoke up right then and agreed, telling him that she could very well have a severe head or spinal injury. 

She came to, just before emergency Personnel arrived. She started to scream in pure agony and pain, while I tried to gently and matter-of-factly tell her not to move at all. I told her she had been in an accident and was unconscious for over 2 minutes and that help would be there any second. 

Help arrived less than three minutes after the woman regained consciousness. My friend and I left after that. We didn't speak of it to anyone at the party and I haven't really talked about it until now. But the moral of the story, for me at least, was that you should always trust your gut instincts. If I hadn't mentioned to my friend to back off not even 2 minutes before that happened... Let's just say who knows how bad that situation could have turned out.

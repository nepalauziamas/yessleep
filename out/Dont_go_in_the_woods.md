Don’t go in the woods

My parents  always warned me not to go into the woods, “that’s where they live son, if those monsters ever catch you they’ll kill you just as fast as you can spit.” My father always said the same thing when he would catch me staring longingly towards the woods beyond the fields. 


It seemed so cruel to put such large unknown places in front of such a precocious child, didn’t they realize they could be stunting my development? After all where else would a young lad learn necessary skills like how to properly climb a tree or start a fire to keep warm at night? 


These were the thoughts that plagued my tiny 7 year old brain as I walked squarely towards the tree line. I almost made it too before my mother screamed bloody murder and my father,as always swooped in like the hero. Don’t get me wrong I love and feared the man the moment I was born like the son of every farmer but it didn’t stop me from wanting to rebel. 


Got a couple lashes with a wooden spoon from my mother, hurt her more than it did me I was too annoyed to care. The pain of my plans being thwarted was all the punishment I needed. I just wanted to know for my self what was really out there. 


That was ten years ago now and although that wasn’t my last attempt, I’ve mellowed out and and decided to just follow the routine my overly cautious mother laid out..
wake up. 
Feed animals.
Tend the crops. 
School work.
Repeat. 


Nearing my 18th birthday something sparked in me though, a  feeling of deep loneliness. Living this far out in the country our contact with others was heavily limited. And yea I had my Bestfriend who I had known since I was 2, apparently I saw her at the market and cried till my mother brought me over and We weve been best friends ever since. But living over An hour out of town with shut in parents I was lucky to see her once a month. 


if it wasn’t for the fact that selling part of our crops paid for the expenses of raising a kid, my parents would much rather just stay home 24/7 till they died, likely within seconds of each other as I cannot imagine either would know how to exist without the other. 
I’m not sure why that with the ever blossoming loneliness so did  the sparks of curiousity for what may be beyond those trees. 


That night I waited till my parents were asleep to sneak out through the window. The creaking porch seemed to be screaming as if to say “BREAKING THE RULES COME GET ME”. 


Soon enough I was closing in on the tree line, I held my breath as I walked through shattering the rule my parents set so long ago, only exhaling when I made it through the first row. Looking around I felt my excitement growing, what on earth were they talking about? It was gorgeous in here and no signs of any monsters. The pale moonlight was peeking through the trees dancing off the leaves and plants gently swaying in the cool night air. Soon enough I was exploring the woods like I’ve always belonged here. Climbing the trees felt so natural the Forrest so dense I could practically swing branch to branch. I spent  the night exploring the zone behind my house. The woods went on for miles and miles I knew that much but it’s different when you’re in the thick of it. The plant life felt more vibrant here like it was happier out here untended. The night was perfect minimal bugs and not one spooky creature. 


It wasn’t until I went to leave that I felt uneasy. Just as I got to the edge of the tree line I felt a chill down my spine the type you only get when someone is watching you. I didn’t look back to check as I sprinted back to the safety of my home. I swiftly climbed back in through the window and laid in bed processing all that I had seen that night, I managed to fall asleep somehow through my excitement when 

- “OHHHHHHHH HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOUUUUUUUU..” I awoke with a start nearly last nights adventure flooding my brain. I almost felt guilty  but my Mother choosing to sing me awake or should I say screech since she can’t hold a tune, instantly tossed that out of the window
“Uhg mom please don’t sing the whole thing I fell asleep late reading last night can we do this later, please?” 

My mother stopped with a frown placing a hand on her hip, “you never let me have any fun! I know you’re not a baby anymore could you at least pretend to humor me once in a while?” My less than enthusiastic attempt at a grin caused her to give me the classic mom face,” Well alright Ez your father already took care of your chores today so you can just relax, maybe go into town see if Gigi wants to hang out” she raised her eyebrows at me knowingly and slipped out the door before I could respond. 


I hated when she mentioned Gigi, just because our parents think we’d be the cuteeeeest couple we’ve had a silent agreement to stay just friends.  I pulled my self out of bed kicking myself for not locking the door last night but I didn’t know I’d get a wake up call at, I checked the clock and groaned 7:00am even on my birthday 2 hours past normal Is all theyll deviate from the schedule. Well if I’m going to town I might as well head out now it’s an hours drive and I’d like to get there before Gigi takes off without me. 


Going into my bathroom I quickly washed my face and well you don’t need to know the rest frankly. I quickly snatched the keys to my beat up jeep before my mom insisted on cooking me a four course meal instead deciding I’d just steal whatever Gigi was eating. The drive to her house gave me time to think about what I’d tell her, she had always wanted to go into the woods too, I was ten minutes in to my drive when rapid beeping snapped me back into reality. Driving in the other lane was- Gigi? 
What the hell? 


I slammed my breaks and we both park our cars facing opposite directions. I get out and go over and  she’s already talking at a speed not yet discovered by scientists  “Ohmygods weARE literally so connected I was coming to your house and let me guess you were headed to mine? Doesn’t matter get in what should we go do maybe up to the diner or oo we could-“ 

“I went into wooods last night”. 


For the first time in 16 years of friendship she stopped talking her eyes wide ,mouth open like a trout. 
“It wasn’t scary at all no monsters like my  parents drilled into us I almost wanted to tell them this morning but I didn’t wanna be in lockdown right when I hit 18 plus I wanted to tell you about it first”. I didn’t mention that feeling I got when I was leaving, not if I wanted today to go as planned. 


Besides it was probably just my tired brain playing tricks on me it was like 4am  after all. Gigi spoke after what felt like an eternity “I really wish you had waited for me you promised I could come too!” She pouted like a child. I sighed internally, brat. 


“Aw cmon I’m sorry what if I told you that since my parents think I’m in town and I’m goin out on limb, your dads still dead and your moms too drunk to notice you took her car, that after we ditch the vehicles we can head out there all day.” Gigi grinned “you got it bud let’s head into the monsters den.” She giggled and I forced out a laugh hoping she wouldn’t notice. 


pushing that nagging feeling and my fathers words out of mind. We decided to go to old man Rutgers farm to access the woods today. He had been placed in a care facility after his wife died, my parents took care of his Fields and helped handle his affairs since he had no kin.I knew it would be empty today since we checked them yesterday. still we hid the cars in the barn with tarps as if my father could see through wood walls but not a tarp. It was a nice hot day perfect for exploring the forbidden woods. 

Gigi grabbed my hand as we marched through the overgrown grass towards the entrance of the woods that’s seemed to beckon us since we could crawl. “Gods Ez I’m so excited, it’s not even your first time but I can’t expect you’re already over it I feel like my heart is going to explode!!!” I squeezed her hand to let her know was listening, she kept rambling  but I was focused on the trees. Something seemed different today less..welcoming. Gigi didn’t share my fears pulling me right through that first row. She dropped my hand gasping with wonder as she looked around with her already large eyes practically escaping her head. She looked so beautiful as she- stop it Ez it’s just Gigi being Gigi. I shook the intrusive thought and looked around, It was a totally different look during the day time, pockets of sun shot through brightly illuminating the world normally kept in dark by the thick tree tops. Gigi flashed her signature ‘I’m about to do something stupid smile’ at me as she started to run through the trees. Panic coursed through my whole body and I took off after her . We ran for a few minutes before she stopped and froze leaning down at the edge of what looked like a cliff


 “Georgina Maria Filbert I swear-“ 

“shhhhhhhh!” She diverted her gaze to flash me a terror filled look, the same  one she had when she came to my house after her dads attack. 
I shut up quickly, stepping as gently as I could to avoid making noise to see what could have my friend so scared. I closed the gap between us crouching down with her to see what she was looking at. I guess when  we came in this way it led us to a steep valley instead of totally flat woods like behind my house. Looking down the valley my eyes quickly settled on the scene set in the valley below us.
It 

Was

Horrifying 


I’ll never forget the image of its eerily calm face as it worked on what used to be a deer, I could only tell because the creature had removed its head and left it sitting on a stone nearby as if warning anyone of what it’s capable of. It sounded like the creature was whistling I think it was happy. Sick fuck.
It took everything in me not to scream and I was thanking the gods I didn’t eat anything today.  
 

It wasn’t particularly tall, but it’s skin was stretched so tight across its thin face it seemed as if it’s skin would tear if it turned its neck too far. The  monsters eyes were small and beady an unnatural shade of blue with greasy blood matted hair  that stuck to its face. It was wearing a thick coat unzipped but it was so coated in blood I couldn’t tell what colour if any it’s shirt was. Its body it kept hidden for the most part but I could tell the thing was too skinny, it  moved wrong too, although its hand movements were fluid it seemed clumsy when walking between its piles.
Oh god it’s  hands- it had so many fingers.


I glanced at Gigi to see if she was seeing this too, her face was fixed in terror as she watched the creature cut its already mutilated prey. The beast must have just finished with its head removal when we stumbled upon it and was now removing its skin from its flesh.It didn’t seem to be eating it just…playing.


My brain raced with thoughts, wishing I had listened to my dad, wondering if I would be able to get out of here alive or more importantly get Gigi to safety at least  without alerting it to our presence. We had to go before it saw us. I put my hand on Gigi’s arm snapping her out of her trance, I signaled to her best I could with hand signals that meant nothing that we needed  to slowly back out and get the hell out of these woods. Of course it didn’t work as easily as that.  

My beautiful dear Gigi, sweet, beautiful, stupid, Gigi made a mistake. When she stood up she reached to grab a branch for support, and picked the weakest one. And of course, when it rains it truly fuckin pours. Gigi tumbled forward sliding head first down the valley..straight towards the now very alert creature. As if in slow motion the creature dropped something I hadn’t seen him holding it glittered in the sunlight still soaked with the deers blood. Expecting the worst I froze at the top, my heart felt like it was lodged in my throat. 


The beast hadn’t noticed me yet or made a move towards Gigi who I couldn’t tell if she was  alive, dead, awake or unconscious. I had to make a decision, quickly sizing up the creature I figured I had to have at least a foot on it, but it was so unnaturally shaped and had too many fingers. 

My mind was made for me when I saw the creature move towards Gigi. I got her into this mess I had a bad feeling but I had to impress her for some reason beyond me. With a look of what I almost could have mistaken for fear if not for the fact he was coated in the blood of the last thing  he brutalized, the creature paused grabbing the object previously dropped, it wiped the blood off and I realize it’s a jagged knife.  My blood freezes in my veins as I screamed as loud as I could as I barreled toward the creature, it’s expression morphed to a look of shock and fear as I ran towards my fallen friend. “GET AWAY FROM HER YOU SICK BASTARD!!”  The creatures eyes bulged out of its head as it surprisingly listened and stumbled backwards


“I-I-I I’mm so-sosorry I didn’t me-me mean to I was-wasn’t going to hu-hurt her” the monster was speaking? And nonetheless I understood it.


 “Uhhh it’s okay?” Why the fuck was I comforting this barbaric creature?? 

From the ground Gigi groaned and  start to mumble. “Shit! Gigi are you okay? Shit my parents are going to kill me”. 


“Is she okay?” The strange beast whispered loud enough for me to hear but I ignored him as I checked Gigi for any wounds that might  need my mothers steady hand with a needle and thread. 

Thankfully it looked like scrapes and bruises nothing too serious. “Don’t try to move okay I don’t think you’re too hurt Gee but Jesus don’t do that to me again  okay ?” Gigi mumbled back “yes I’ll try not fall down a mountain again.” 
Despite the circumstances I smirked if I knew my Gigi if she’s making sarcastic comments she’ll be just fine. My attention was stolen when the creature spoke in his high pitched timid voice again. 

“Uhhh hey I’m sorry if I scared  you and your—christ I don’t even know what the hell you things are I’ve never seen anything like you not in books, movies shit not even my wildest fuckin fantasies I always thought I was fine out here dad always said it was the dead lands to avoid-“

“Hold the fuck on there  what do YOU mean  WE scared you??” I stared at the creature with a look of pure confusion.   ”You’re out here carving a deer up and you look like someone pulled your skin too tight  and  WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY FINGERS!!” My outburst seemed to have shocked it out of fear and into just regular old anger.


“Me?? Why do you have so few finger huh? Did you ever think of that or are you too self absorbed cause newsflash buddy you and your girl are scary as shit“ he paused looking down at Gigi before proceeding,” Is it a girl does your kind have those?” 

“She’s not my girlfriend just my friend I’ve known her my whole life and yes ‘our kind’ has girlS.” I had figured he was a male but I still couldn’t help but to tease the rude, presumptuous creature, “are you a girl in your species what even are 
you?”


The creature looked as if he was in pain but finally started laughing. “ oh my god out of all this you’re making it known she’s not your girlfriend, me thinks the freak doth protest too much, anyways if you really want to know they call us humans, now what the fuck are you?”

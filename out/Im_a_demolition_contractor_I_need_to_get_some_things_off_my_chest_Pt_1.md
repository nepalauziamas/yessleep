Okay, here we go. I’ve kept all these experiences bottled up for way too long and I have to get them out of my head. There’s nothing too traumatic here, nothing violent or particularly scary. It’s just been a really weird few years with a lot of weird experiences. And for some reason, I feel like I’ll forget them all if I don’t write them down.

I work with about six to twelve other guys (not sure of the actual number) with similar construction backgrounds who get called all over the place. With this company, I’ve been to every corner of North America and even to Europe a few times in the past few years. Sometimes they put us on private jets, especially when it’s a more time-sensitive job. And I want to make it clear that I’m paid really well for these jobs, too. Like three times what I’d make on my own doing local demo work.

At first, I thought the people offering me the position were either ignorant or insane. Why not just get random nearby construction guys to handle these jobs? I guess I figured for the most part I’d just be tearing down old buildings, moving dirt around, and getting big plots of land ready for housing developments. I’m hardly more experienced than the next guy working on any given jobsite. But that’s when they brought me in to sign an NDA and a lot of other paperwork I probably should have had a lawyer read over before I put pen to paper.

As such, it’s expressly forbidden for me to share any details of any jobsite that would help someone identify the location. In the interests of saving my own ass from being sued – or much worse, I suspect – I’m going to talk pretty vaguely about the specific locations I’ve been to. I feel confident enough with the relative anonymity of this subreddit that I can tell these stories and not have it traced back to me. At the very worst, it might show up on their radar at some point – but based on the nature of this sub they can simply deny the validity of any of these stories.

And yeah, most of the work I do actually does involve demolishing older structures and clearing undeveloped land in preparation for new houses or duplexes. That’s where most of these stories come from. I’ve done about forty jobs for these people so far and in the past few months, it’s really ramped up. I probably get to sleep in my own bed at most two nights a week now, but the pay is so good I honestly can’t see myself quitting any time soon.

Still, I’m having a lot of trouble living my life without telling anybody what I’ve seen. I know if I told friends or family, they’d either a) think I was full of shit or b) go nuts about it and demand I tell them everything I know. Either way, it’d put me in a tough situation. I’m more comfortable sharing it here secretly and getting my thoughts together on all of it. Writing it down is also helping me remember more minor details, so I may be updating these threads from time to time.

Anyway, I’m ready now. These are some of the things I’ve seen and done as a construction and demolition contractor for a really weird company.

## The Mounds

When I first started, the company told me I needed to always have two forms of identification on my person on every jobsite – one in my wallet and at least one more somewhere else on my body. At first, this didn’t make much sense to me, but I quickly understood why. There are times when the job can be a little dangerous – especially when I’m on a site all by myself like I was on this one.

Thus, I keep a state ID card in my jacket pocket and my driver license in my wallet at all times. Nothing too terrible happened while I was clearing the mounds, but I can see how someone less experienced might have had a serious accident and met their untimely end with no one else there to provide rescue.

The property itself was within shooting distance of a very large, very famous river. I’d never seen it up close before, so when I drove over the bridge to get to the jobsite it was a sight to behold for sure. On the property itself, you’d never know you were so close to such power. But I strongly suspect that the people who once lived there, whoever it was that built the structures that laid beneath the mounds… they were well aware of the river.

The mounds themselves were tremendous, circular structures. There were seven of them, all between eight and fourteen feet high, at least twenty wide. At first, I thought they were going to be nothing more than huge piles of dirt, but after pushing into the first one with my bulldozer, I knew there was considerably more to them.

After feeling the dozer grind to a halt beneath me, I could tell I’d hit something fairly solid. Curiosity got the better of me so I climbed out and went to investigate and saw what looked like a concrete pillar laying on its side. Upon closer inspection, I could make out detailed writing and pictographs running up and down the entire length of the exposed column.

The only other piece of heavy equipment on the site was a weather-worn excavator. I used it to pull the column out of the mound and get a better look, but the writing was all Greek to me. Literally, it looked like something from ancient Europe rather than what I knew of Native American languages. I used the excavator’s bucket to roll it away from the mound, then got back into the bulldozer to get back to work. I found at least four more of these columns along with the crumbling remains of old walls and what might have been a stone ceiling in the first mound, and several more throughout the next few mounds I worked on. The poor bulldozer had its work cut out for it that afternoon.

Then something kind of embarrassing happened. Once I got about halfway through pushing the dirt away into another pile (which later became one much larger pile when I was done), the dozer started falling into *something*. I could sense the ground beneath the dozer giving way, and within a few seconds I was six or seven feet lower into the earth. I scrambled out and away, then used some quick thinking to get back into the excavator.

I’ll admit, I damaged that bulldozer pretty severely while getting it unstuck. It was a painstaking effort and took more than an hour, but I got it free of whatever it had fallen into. Afterward, I got back into the dozer and pushed the rest of the dirt, rocks, and a whole lot of mysterious ancient rubble into the hole I’d made. Fortunately, my bosses never did give me any shit for the huge dents and scrapes I left on the dozer.

It went on like this for the rest of the day (without any more near-death experiences, fortunately), and I was only about halfway done. I stayed the night in a hotel a few miles away and finished the job the next day, leaving a truly massive pile of rubble for someone else to clean up after I headed back home. The company likes to do it this way sometimes, staggering the work out over several days or weeks with only one worker at a time on the jobsite.

I spent a lot of time staring at old marble and stone over that two-day period, but before you ask, I didn’t take any pictures. Even if I had, I think showing them here might give away a bit too much information about the location of the site itself – and lead the company right to who is making these posts.

## The Bottomless Pit

This time the company put me on a flight with two other guys, I’ll call them Rick and Jerry. Both of them had been on previous jobs with me, but never together, and this was the first time there’d been three of us on a single job to my knowledge. Turns out it was because this would have taken like four days with just one or two of us.

We were also under explicit instructions to communicate with each other as little as possible and only discuss the job at hand. At the time, I thought it was kind of strange, but figured it was because they wanted us to get it done quickly.

When we got to the jobsite outside a small town in the Midwest, there was an old farmhouse next to what I can only describe as a bottomless pit. It was around 11AM when we got there and we had to wait for the guy with the backhoe for almost 2 hours, so we spent plenty of time staring down into this thing – avoiding discussing exactly what the fuck it was. At noon, the sun was directly above but even then the sunlight didn’t show anything at the bottom – after a while it just turned to blackness. Or maybe our eyes simply couldn’t see that far down.

The hole itself was about eight feet in diameter and was surrounded by high grass that hadn’t seen a lawnmower or weed-eater in decades. I don’t know if it was *actually* bottomless because we did hear some sounds when we dropped stuff into it, mostly echoing thumps coming back from God knows how far down. My theory is that eventually the rocks and refuse we dropped were simply bouncing off the sides of the hole on the way down because we never heard a real impact or splash from what might have been the bottom.

Rick and I handled most of the work the first day, including demolishing the farmhouse. The inside of it was pretty boring, and I’m 90 percent sure meth heads had been living in it a few years ago. There were some gruesome twin mattresses scattered around the living room and remnants of burnt trash in the fireplace. I always hate tearing those old homeplaces down though. I feel like with the right amount of TLC, they could be perfectly livable.

It was a real pain in the ass patching that hole up, by the way. With an ordinary sinkhole you can just move some rocks or gravel in, maybe a wooden beam or two across it. In the worst cases with sinkholes you need to pour concrete in. Landscapers deal with these all the time. But this thing required a level of construction know-how that was beyond my experience. Fortunately, Jerry said he’d worked on one of these before. We had to use the backhoe to dig down a few meters around the thing then create a sort of raised platform out of cinder blocks, then we poured big concrete runners that we later laid across the hole. After that, we sealed it up with sheets of plywood and pushed a bunch of dirt over the top of it. The future owners of the land will probably never know there’s a hole that goes down at least a few hundred feet into nothingness in their fucking driveway.

When we left the property at the end of the next day (where we did most of the work of sealing the hole), I jumped up and down on the dirt covering up the pit to see if it felt hollow. I weigh about 220 and could definitely hear and feel *something* different about the spot, almost like I was jumping on top of a huge, muffled drum, but figured someone would have to know what they were looking for to ever discover it again.

All I wanted to do on the flight home was ask Rick and Jerry what they thought that pit actually was. How far down did it really go? Was it a natural formation or something else?

Jerry’s a much older guy, probably runs his own company somewhere and takes this job for the extra income, so he’s always played pretty strictly by the company’s rules. Kept his mouth shut the whole time. Rick gave me a few knowing glances, asking “*What the hell was that, man?”* with his eyes. But the next few times I worked with those guys over the course of that first year, they never mentioned our previous experiences, so neither did I.

## The House in the Woods

I’m not going to say exactly where I live, but I will say I’m in one of the most heavily forested parts of the country. The area is actually named after the woods throughout the region. That’s what makes this particular job special: it was only about an hour from my house.

I hit the road about fifteen minutes after I got the call and was there by 9AM. My GPS led me to a mailbox and a gate surrounded by some of the thickest woods imaginable. You know the type – so dense you can’t see more than ten or fifteen feet inside the tree line before it becomes too dark and blurry to see further.

After getting out of my truck to open the gate, I drove slowly and carefully down a winding red dirt driveway lined by tall pine trees. It had rained a few days prior and I did *not* want to get stuck with nobody around for miles to come to my rescue. I had cell service and a fully charged phone so I wasn’t super worried, but this job has taught me a lot about caution, especially when I’m alone on a jobsite.

Eventually the driveway opened up to a small clearing with a structure in the center. It was a single-story frame house that looked to have been built in the 1970s or early ‘80s. The exterior paint and siding were bright white and looked like they’d had a fresh coat applied not too long ago, but the house and land itself were undeniably deserted. The decorative shrubs had grown out of control long ago and thick, brambly brush had crept its way inexorably up to the front porch of the house. Surprisingly, a brand new excavator sat on the other side of the house, ready to go.

I had to high-step my way to the front door to perform my usual inspection, more than once kicking thorny, tangled vines away from my legs. Once inside, I was treated to the usual smell of neglect and decay, but was shocked at the size of the foyer I stood in. It was around fifteen feet deep and eight feet wide, lined by sturdy-looking oak doors. I took one on my right at random and found myself in what seemed like an empty bedroom or study. There was another door on the opposite wall of the room, what I thought had to be a closet, but to my surprise it opened into another room of a similar size to the one I’d just left. And on the other side of this room was yet another door.

Eventually, the rooms began to change. At first, the floors became more solid – made from tile, beautiful hardwood, and then stone. As I went further on, the walls changed too. I never encountered any furniture or mess until the rooms were completely built from stone, floor to ceiling. In these, strange chandeliers hung above me and old desks and couches were strewn with old clothing and papers. I didn’t dare stop for too long – all I wanted was to find the exterior wall of the goddamn house.

I estimate I spent around two hours in that place, just opening doors. The only time I’d stop moving in what felt like a straight line was when the rooms got colder. At one point I walked into what looked like an old library – lots of empty wooden shelves lining the walls – and I could see my breath. I turned around and exited immediately and took a door to my left I hadn’t seen on the way through the previous room. After a few more nondescript, empty rooms, I found myself back in the big foyer and practically tumbled outside into the warm spring air.

When I finally got into the excavator and got to work razing the exterior walls, the fucker came apart like paper. By my count, there were only six or seven rooms total, and the foyer was only about a quarter the size I remembered it being from the inside. No tile or stone floors, no hanging chandeliers, antique furniture, or old paperwork, and definitely no library. Also, the excavator was an air conditioned newer model so I never noticed any changes in temperature as I tore apart each of the rooms.

At the end of the work day, I left the old house in a pile of rubble. Since I was so close, I drove home to sleep in my own bed that night. The next morning, the company gave me a call and told me someone else was bringing out a Bobcat to finish up the demo job.

The strange thing about this one is that it *is* so close to me. I feel like I experienced something I shouldn’t have in that old house. And I often think about going back there, standing where that foyer once stood, and walking in a straight line. I wonder if I’d find those other rooms?

## End Part One

These first few stories are from some of the jobs I did in my first year with the company. This is probably the most I’ve ever written in one sitting, so I hope they make sense. I have three or four more I’d like to tell about that first year, and then I’ll tell you more.

I think the company has started trusting me a lot more lately. Some of the places I’ve been and the stuff I’ve seen in recent months has made me totally rethink a lot of things. For the longest time, I was a staunch, boring atheist demolition contractor. I’m not sure what you could call me now, but I’ve experienced enough to convince me there’s a lot more going on in this world than we realize.

Also, I think the company might have been doing this for a really, really long time. I’m pretty sure they have a global reach, and they’re spending a lot of money having us erase or cover up some weird stuff that never makes it to the history books. Or the science books, for that matter.

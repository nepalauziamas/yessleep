I'm 34, but when I was 18 or 19 I had an interesting experience.

I've suffered from sleep paralysis since I was 15. Usually, just laying there, paralysed and panicking, while a demon stands there at the foot of my bed, but one day I found out how to leave my body.

I was asleep in my boyfriends bed, him beside me. I had sneaked into his house as his parents wouldn't let us be in the same room, for obvious reasons. Got into his room and he pushed a chair against his door handle so the parents couldn't get in. He wasn't allowed a key.

We were tired and just slept. Had been in a club that night, nothing crazy, quite tame. Think we got a taxi back or train, you know I don't remember.
Then at some point during the night I awoke, but not in the conventional way. I awoke to see a demon trail out of my boyfriend. The demon then stood at the foot of the bed laughing.

I felt comforted knowing that my boyfriend was beside me, even though he was unconscious. So I guess something changed. I was no able to leave my body. There was a rope above my head and I pulled and pulled, it felt like I was an elastic band stuck to the bed. It was so hard to leave my body, but I did.

The demon re-entered my boyfriends boy. I got up, turned around kneeling on the bed looking at me 'sleeping' and my boyfriend beside me.

I got on top of him and using my two fists clenched together I pounded them on his chest repeatedly demanding 'get out of my boyfriend you demon'. While he didn't move.

Next morning we wake up. Me exhausted cos I had another weird sleep paralysis experience, but different. This is when things became very uneasy...

He tried to sit up in bed...but...his chest was so sore he couldn't move. His Dad is a doctor and he had to call him. I hid under the bed buck naked, no lie. He got the meds and rested. I'm not sure how his Dad even got into the room, I must have moved the chair blocking the door.

I never told him about my sleep paralysis experience. As far as he knew I slept well.

Months went by and we decided to move in together, well not we, he moved out (to his parents dismay), and asked me to move in with him. We were only together 6 months.

I agreed, to my mother's dismay, she said I'll be back home eventually (smart mother). And maybe she was right.

Very soon after moving in with him, I noticed changes, but they happened so gradually over the time we were living together. He lost touch with his friends, my friends were now his also, he'd tried to control me, convince me that I'm the problem, that my friends don't "laugh with you, but at you". He became evil...my friends told me to leave him.

I can't describe what happened in our 'relationship', because it's too much for Reddit. Even at 34 I remember everything, every detail vividly.

One night, I woke up with him on top of me, trying to strangle me. His black North Face t-shirt he wore to bed, my finger ripped it off him like it was paper.

Believe me I'm not including 90% of the stories, but you don't need to know them.

Pushed him off me, grabbed my phone, he smashed it, so I grabbed his. Called the police and they picked me up.

So anyways...to this day, I connect me banging his chest, trying to save him, with him trying to kill me. Waw he possessed? There were days I cried in our bed, out loud saying, "I'm with the devil", "I know what the devil looks like". There was nothing behind his eyes, no soul.

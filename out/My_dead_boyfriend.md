Little bit of info first:
- I’m a F20 now and hi die when i was 19
- He was my love in life and was helping me so much to get my live on the right tracks 
- We lived together and had done that for 1 year
- We was ecspecing a baby, but I lost the baby in january 2021
- I got a new boyfriend in the start of 2022 and we are now trying for a baby 

So in April 2021  i lost my boyfriends when he committed suicide, he didn’t want to live more and that was so hard for me to understand. In june 2021 my dreams start to just be about him, we did stuff together and it was just us two again. We had sex, and that was the best sex we ever had! I feel like he still want to be with me and live together. 

Then 2022 comes and I find this new guy and all off my dreams stops. I’m so unhappy, cus i miss him soo bad and it was bad enough that i lost him in real life but now hi was gone from my dreams to.
 
That was not until last night he returned(06.18.22). We did have sex again, but this time is was different from the other times. First we had sex as normally, but then he says something I can’t get out of my head “you need to check who is the father of your baby, so your boyfriend don’t finds out its me, I can’t be a dead father again”. That didn’t make me think of it in the dream but now I can’t stop to think about it. My and my boyfriend are trying for a baby but so fare had no luck 

Back to the dream, he invited me to see how he lived now, and I was thinking “if I’m going to belive in this when I wake up I need pictures”, so I take a video. When I did that a women comes up to us, and she say’s “you are not dead, you need to go back to your world now, if not you will die!” But I didn’t want to go back, I just want to be with my boyfriend who is dead. And i ask about our baby i lost, so i hold my baby and cry cus I don’t want to leave my family! But I hear the women says it’s time to send her home, and thats when I’m wake up in my bed. I’m still crying and want to go back to my family!

This dream is to real for me, and I need ti hear if someone else has an experience like this. Because this is to crazy for me and I don’t know what to think.
And no, the video I took was not on my phone when I woke up it was gone! I can’t understand how something so real can only be a dream! 
(This stort is a 100% true!)

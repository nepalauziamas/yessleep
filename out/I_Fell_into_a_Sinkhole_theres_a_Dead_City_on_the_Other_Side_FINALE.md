[PART ONE](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uqkql0/i_fell_into_a_sinkhole_theres_a_dead_city_on_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

I had spent nearly every waking hour for the past few days now trying to find some means of escape. From under bridges, to the top of skyscrapers. I checked every nook, cranny, and back alley. I was much too afraid of going into the sewer system, especially since Samantha has warned me about giant monsters lurking nearby. I'm glad to say that I haven't seen any.

She mentioned a few days back that not long after the city was enveloped by the event, she and her friends managed to cause one large monster to fall into a sinkhole and die. The same hole that she fell in, thus separating her from her friends who she now believes are likely dead. She told me how originally, they thought that it was an escape from this world. She was the only one who fell in first, but the bottom turned out to be nothing more than rocks and dirt. She barely avoided getting crushed by this mysterious monster.

"What killed it?" I asked.

"I fell on the soft dirt near the edges, it fell in the center on a large boulder and broke its neck." she spoke a little amused.

I too found this story pretty funny actually.

But on one particularly frustrating morning, especially since I could see another round of those green clouds rolling in on me, Samantha who had been accompanying me said, "Just give up. It's pointless. There is no beam of light that is around here. I've looked everywhere and I've never seen anything so out of place as that. Plus, there’s less people, so less likely to find further info."

For context, I told her about the Nexus Points.

"Sam, don't you want to leave this place? I know it's too late for your friends, but you need to believe that you'll still have a chance. And I'm not going to give up. I didn't survive a potential face mauling just to get trapped in another dimension."

"I've been here for months now. I struggle to sleep at night all the time. And you're going through my supplies and not helping me to replenish."

"I won't abandon you. But if you think that we need to go our separate ways for now, I understand. I'll come get you if I find the way out."

I thought that maybe this was going to be the moment where she wanted to stay by me and continue our little search. I thought we had built some sort of connection.

But she turned around and left me high and dry. I felt rather betrayed, but I guess I walked into that one.

Regardless, she did tell me to stay out of the rain and I made it my mission to always do so. I also tried not to step on any of the blobs. I later found out that they were humans, animals and even some plants. Some mixed together, becoming bigger blobs.

I expanded my search in the rural area. There was no food around here and I was already starting to get hungry. Drinking water wasn't dangerous, especially since the green rain removed all of the germs from the water. Perhaps I should have gone in and grabbed some food supplies before heading out to the countryside.

That's when I came across something weird. There was a hole in the middle of the road I had been travelling on, along with a single blob next to it. Two eyes opened and stared at me. They were human and they appeared to be almost content with their situation. I guess after a while, you have to accept the fact that you're no longer a movable creature anymore. I wondered if this sinkhole was the same one that Sam fell in?

But my search had to press on. I was heading towards the large barrier that Samantha had told me about. And when I got there, a sudden panic attack triggered when I saw what the barrier was made of.

I gripped hard on my heart, watching as I saw a swirling maelstrom of blackened arms that were rubbing up against each other, shrouding themselves in a black fog and creating a tight-knit wall that you wouldn't want to even try to pass through. Samantha mentioned how one of her friends went through and she was ripped apart by their menacing grip.

There had to be a way to break a hole in it. Surely this isn't some sort of indestructible barrier. Although, if my frequent dreams of these things have told me anything, they're incredibly solid.

The plan was set then, I needed to break through this barrier. I wasn't sure how thick it was, but it's better than staying here forever.

\*\*\*

I returned back to Samantha's home and after using the key she gave me, I found her in her room. Her face had a sorrowful look. When she saw that I was back, she put up a dismal attempt to hide her downhearted feelings.

"So," she sniffed. "Ready to give up on this pointless quest of yours."

Although I couldn't tell that that was what she wanted me to say, I wondered if she was also hoping that I would be coming to her with good news. News that I knew how to get out.

"Samantha, I haven't found the exit yet. But I do have an idea on how to get out."

She looked at me with a curious expression. I could tell she was confused, and I would have to elaborate further on my plan.

Once I was done telling her, she took a deep inhale and said, "That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."

"What, why?"

"That barrier surrounds the entire city and nearby farmland. I have never once found an exit point."

"That's why we test out the barrier's strength."

"Why should I?" she turned away from me and buried her face into her pillow. I keep forgetting that she's just a teenager and hasn't had to do anything other than what she has wanted to do all this time. I never had a kid, but I wasn't about to make her do something that she didn't want to.

"Samantha, please," I was begging. I wasn't going to leave her here and if it meant that my dreams of stopping a war were going up in flames, so be it. I was never a fan of doing things for the common good anyway. Consider me a little too individualistic. Or maybe I had come to care about this lost child too much.

She wiped her eyes, turned back to me and I could see that they were red from excessive crying. She threw herself at me, crying into my shoulder and saying, "I don't want to lose another person," she sobbed. "I lost all my friends. I don't even know where my family is, but considering what has happened, I don't want to lose the last person that I've ever seen after all these months trapped here. Especially since he’s a decent and kind man."

Her grip on me was tight. She needed someone to be there for her. I figured it was best to return her need for someone by hugging her and saying, "I would never force you, Samantha. I merely want to get you to see the beauty of the sun again. To feel the brushing of grass. I want you to be free. Free with me back on Earth."

She moved her head up and our eyes locked. Those were the eyes of someone who had come to a decision. She lowered her head again and said, "Fine... I'll go. I'm tired anyway. Every night I have a nightmare that threatens to kill me. If there was a reason to die now, at least it would be trying to escape this unbearable world."

I was actually really thrilled. That took care of one issue. Now onto the next. That was going to be finding as many explosives as possible for my plan to proceed.

\*\*\*

I looked through every house that I could find, every shop that was abandoned, and the police station was not spared in my search.

You'd be surprised how many explosives there are in a city. Grenades were a surprise, but natural gas tanks, lighter fluid canisters, and C4 explosives were everywhere in this city. It took me about a month just to find everything that I would assume would cause a rather huge explosion. I was kind of hoping that there would be a tank in this city, but I guess they weren't near any National Guard posts. Just some destroyed Blackhawks and infantry assault vehicles that got crushed by something huge.

The next stage of my plan was to find a large vehicle. A pickup truck would be preferable, and all that was left was finding a suitable route to drive through. Last, but not least, a sniper rifle. None of my current guns would offer me the precise shots that I would need. That part would also be easy. Like I said, there's a police station. There were also a lot of free bullets for me.

The day before we made our escape, the two of us decided to eat what would maybe be our final meal. Two cans of raviolis.

We sat in silence with one another. I think both of us were trying to push out thoughts of changing our mind the entire time, but I can't say for certain of her. I was a little nervous. We had a limited supply of explosives, I'm much more skilled with a shotgun due to the fact that it just blows an entire section instead of pinpoint accuracy.

"Having second thoughts?" she spoke abruptly.

I inhaled deeply and said, "A little bit."

"I think we'll make it."

"Why the optimism?"

"Because I have nothing else if we don't make the trip."

She was right. If we decided to give up right here and spend the rest of our lives in this place, it would only be a matter of time before something came along and killed us. Whether it would be the batteries of the shock collars going out while we were sleeping, or the rain getting us.

"Well, I promise I'll fight tooth and nail for you." I reassured her.

I almost detected a smile escape, but quickly her face returned to its normal, stoic demeanor.

"You know, I'm a monster hunter. I'm a bit new at it, but I've already managed to help another monster incapacitate an even more dangerous one."

"Why tell me?" her eyes looked up at me.

"Well," I swallowed with hesitation. "I was wondering if you'd like to join me. You don't have to; I can be sure you'll go looking for your family out there somewhere."

"My family lived here in the city,"

The mood quickly dawned on me. She was all alone. That would mean that she's an orphan now. I guess I'd have to think about some things from here on out.

We made sure that we did have one way out though. We each had a handgun in case we couldn’t escape.

\*\*\*

The day was set, we had arrived. We pulled up towards the barrier in a pickup truck. Samantha was driving and I told her to move forward in a straight line, and don't have a panic attack at any moment. This was risky. I have grown more accustomed to these high-pressure situations, but even if she has lived here all this time, I find it rather unlikely that she would have the mental strength to handle the stress.

I got down from the pickup truck, and the first thing we were going to use was our least needed explosive. Lighter fluid. I just want to test it out.

I sat it down and ran back to the pickup truck, pointed the rifle at it, then fired. There was a small plume of fire and smoke and thankfully the arms retreated. But not by much. That's why I got explosives.

I must say, my ability to learn new skills, including shooting guns accurately, has been getting far more improved at a faster rate than before. Strange, I used to be a slow learner.

But anyhow, we began our tunneling expedition through the vine of arms. I placed a canister and blew a massive hole through it. We were so excited to have an exit but going through the tunnel was an unnerving experience. Occasionally I thought I saw a head poking out.

It was a simple matter of patience, supply, and hoping we wouldn't have a dud on our hands. I looked back towards the entrance from where we came and saw that it was starting to close back up. But I also looked ahead, and I could swear I saw something poking through. An orange light I believe. I think we were coming out to another end.

The look on Samantha's face when she saw the light was also a little heartwarming for me. But just as soon as we had gotten our hopes up, we both heard a low growling sound coming from behind us.

I pointed my sniper rifle back and peered through the scope. We had probably gone some 100 ft, maybe more, but at the entrance, just before it was about to fully close back up, a black, slimy liquid started pulling through, stretching out tendrils and hooking onto the hands. They looked to be trying to pull it apart, but it slipped through their grasps.

I was immediately frightened by sudden honking from Samantha as she tried to get my attention.

She rolled down the glass and said, "KEEP TUNNELING!"

Her eyes had this deathly fear in them that immediately got me back to our journey. I would start the process of planting an explosive, firing on it or setting it off, and repeat.

All the while, that shapeless creature was pulling itself closer towards us at a speed that was much faster than what our truck was able to go. I gave it a warning shot first, but my bullet passed right through it, meaning that this was not going to hurt it in the slightest.

"Well it's not a primordial," I remarked.

Finally I threw one of the natural gas tanks and fired at it. The explosion was much bigger than I anticipated and a wave of flames overwhelmed our vehicle, with the sound of metal scraping against metal.

Although I was fully dressed in fire resistant clothes, my gloves were fingerless so I was left with some burns on them. I fell down, my hands shaking from the sudden injury.

Samantha was screaming, saying there was only one more left. It was a thin layer of arms that was still holding tight. She screamed, "Should I ram it?"

I said, "No," and staggered back to my feet, looking at another one of those natural gas tanks that we had. I was reluctant to use this again, but we had a few other choices. And then that got me thinking.

I grabbed the tank and threw it as hard as I could towards the gelatinous monster that was nearly on top of us. When the tank landed on the creature, I had a clear shot and fired.

***Bang!***

Again, flames started coming towards us but this time they were a little further out and I was able to duck down in time.

With that out of the way, I threw my last grenade at the other end and watched as it blew a hole. Samantha floored it, giving me almost zero time to react as I nearly fell out of the pickup.

Something told me that the arms knew what we were planning on doing and they were quickly trying to cover back over. Much faster than before. The slime creature was also gaining, stretching out its tentacles and its many eyes attached to them.

We burst out of the exit, just as the hands nearly grabbed me by the head.

The pickup bounced up and down as we drove across a harsh, dry desert with an orange sky and intense heat that hit me a lot harder than I was expecting it.

Samantha slammed hard on brakes and this only threw me forward. I rammed hard into the glass, breaking it in the process.

"Sorry," she sniffed.

I was trying to ignore the fact that my nose and forehead hurt, and saw that we were safe now.

But oh how wrong I was.

I heard the carnivorous roaring of that monster following behind us as it came out through the hole. The arms were unable to get a grasp of it and its dozens of eyes were locked on us.

"Drive, DRIVE NOW!" I ordered, switching over to my AK-47.

We drove as fast as we could on sand and gravel, but the wheels momentarily spun, giving the creature enough time to fire out one of its tendrils and hitting me through the shoulder just as I was taking aim.

"GAHH!" I fell down.

We were moving now, but I was in excruciating pain. I quickly tried to remove the tactical gear and check my shoulder. I don't need another mysterious liquid going through my bloodstream.

The pain was awful and immediately I was coming out of my adrenaline rush.

I laid in the back, staring up at the orange sky and trying my best to keep the pain to myself.

I must have drifted out of consciousness, but I was immediately woken back up when I hit my head due to us stopping abruptly.

"Henry, look!"

Despite the fact that I didn't want to get up, I forced myself over to the edge of the truck and saw an obelisk made of obsidian with green symbols engraved into its surface.

"Is this a Nexus Point?" she asked.

As far as I knew, it's better than nothing. I don't actually know what they look like, but it looks kind of weird so it's good enough. All I did know is that they had a pointed top.

She got out and quickly ran to my side. She had to hold me up as both of us trudged through the sand and up to the gigantic monolith. It was a really tall structure, and I questioned where exactly it was going to take us. Then the next issue came about. How do I activate it?

"I need a moment," I said.

I placed my hand on the stone and pictured home. Yet that had done nothing. Perhaps we were wrong about it.

A rush of pain overwhelmed me again, and I fell over. Samantha quickly laid me up against the stone.

"Please don't die,"

"I'm sorry," I said, genuinely believing that I was.

She had tears in her eyes, and she quickly went to hug me. "I don't want to be alone again. Everyone I ever cared about is dead."

My breathing was becoming heavier and more difficult. I can't believe this is how I go out.

In a fit of rage, she punched the obelisk as hard as she could before spreading her palm over it.

She wouldn't let go of me, but I really wish she would. I could see that monster right behind her, but I was losing strength quickly. I muttered, "Behind you,"

With her hand still on the obelisk, she said, "I want to go home."

The creature was about on top of us, and it had one of its huge, gaping mouths wide open. I closed my eyes, accepting my fate but also disappointed that I wasn't able to save her.

But I was disturbed when I heard sparking sounds. Electricity was flowing upwards and a loud crackle of thunder and a bright light that overwhelmed my eyes, temporarily blinded me. I was also weightless for a brief few seconds before being dropped down onto a concrete road.

Samantha was next to me, looking around in confusion.

"Wait, this place looks like-"

Blood was still rushing out of my shoulder wound, and I was passing out again. The last thing I saw was a semi-truck approaching us on the road.

\*\*\*

When I woke up, I was in a hospital bed. Next to mine, Samantha sat up in her and was eating some of the hospital food with a lack of table manners. I couldn't blame her. It's probably the best food she's had in a long time.

As for me, I pieced together that she had gotten that truck driver to bring us here. When I asked, she said that the doctors were kind enough to give the both of us a room together. She said that I was her father.

I was touched. Glad to see she had that level of comfort about me.

"Well, we survived," I smiled at her.

She returned the smile and went back to eating.

She looked like she could finally relax for the first time in forever. But sleep still eluded her. She seemed more restless than before.

Some things came to light during my stay in Colorado. Once I had made somewhat of a recovery, Samantha and I went to look up her city to see if it ever existed. It doesn't. She says it used to be the second largest city in Colorado and where we ended up was where it used to be. It seems to me that something deleted her city from existence in our world. And also, her identity has also been erased. She had a fresh start, with no one who knew her other than me. Apparently, this city was called "Warmire, Colorado."

Another shocking revelation was that we had actually gone back a few weeks before I went on my journey. I kept this to myself because I was afraid that she would try to go and prevent me from going into that town in Kentucky. There was that chance she might believe it would've been better for me. But we survived and made it back, so I'm satisfied. If she did that, this could prevent my own self from existing, and it would also prevent her from escaping. I wasn't sure if she would do it, but best not to take the chance. But I did find it strange that I still existed. Perhaps the time travelling has something to do with this.

I spent my last few weeks recovering before we had to take a Greyhound bus back to Auburndale. I made sure to arrive on the day that I had left.

So now I have a daughter that is staying with me at the moment. Normally I would say we should have gone through the whole adoption process, but how do you do that with a girl that doesn't exist?

If you have an idea, feel free to speak up.

As I finish typing this out, Samantha is currently sleeping in her room. I check on her every now and then to make sure that she isn't having a nightmare. But, for the first time in so long, she's getting a good night's sleep. I should probably get some sleep too.

For now, take care. I look forward to my next update. This is Henry Miller, out.

 I realised my co-worker Bryan had become homeless and was sleeping in the office only by accident, though in retrospect somebody would have found out sooner or later. 

I suppose it was my notorious good luck that it happened to me. 

I found out one evening, a few weeks ago. Regular business hours were long over and everybody had gone home, at least so I thought- our company has a strict “no-one allowed to stay by themselves in the office” policy. But I had to return. I had left a file I needed in my office. Tomorrow was my cherished “work-from-home” day- all employees have one wfh day a week as our company is really big on flexibility and mental health- and I had forgotten to take an important file home with me. 

It was about 9pm, the fall night sky completely dark. I parked my car in its usual spot, jumped out, and dashed towards my office building, already a bit jittery from breaking office policy and going back in the dark building by myself. 

I let myself in with my key card, and entered the forest of cubicles, only illuminated by the faint street light filtering through the blinds. I worked in Human Resources, in private offices at the back but it felt weird and unnecessary to turn on the main lights. I was in a hurry to get out, I fumbled and flipped on my cellphone flashlight and headed to my office.

I didn’t even see him. My foot hit something soft and squishy yet substantial. I heard a human cry. I flashed my light down.

It was a blue sleeping bag, framing the startled face of one of my co-workers. Brett? Bryan? My mind raced.

It would be hard to say which of us was more shocked and upset. Then I realised of course I should have known- I was HR and I was supposed to know about employee problems which could affect their work. But he had always looked completely normal. Clean. Untalkative.

The whites of his eyes glistened as he raised his hand to shield himself from the blinding light of my cellphone. And suddenly my shock gave way to pure fear, rushing through my veins and paralysing me. I really needed my file, but I also really needed to get out of there. For no clear reason, my brain noticed a stapler on the desk nearby and wondered if it was a good weapon and if I could reach it quickly enough if I needed it. 

He tried to scramble up and the swishy sound of fabric echoed through the cubicles but he seemed entangled with the sleeping bag. He began talking very fast “Please please Kirsten- don’t tell anybody- please. It’s just until I save up for a down payment. I’m not causing any trouble- please. Just for another couple of weeks. I’m all set to move out by first of month- actually my friend Chris offered me a place to crash- so probably earlier-”

For no reason, scenes from the charity drive we had done as a team-bonding activity last month idiotically flashed through my brain- I had actually been on the organizing committee for that and it had been so much fun. I opened my mouth and said "The shelter?” 

Bryan frowned and snapped "Don’t be ridiculous- that place is fucking awful- and dangerous. I can’t go there! Also I’m not like an actual homeless guy- I just need a place to crash for a couple of weeks- please Kirsten- let this go and you won’t even know you ever saw me-" he reached out and gripped my wrist and I flinched and pulled away and started walking towards my office. If only I could get the file and get out of there. 

"You’re not going to tell anyone?” he called.

I turned back and looked at him and smiled my work-smile. "No. I just need to get something from my office- tomorrow’s my wfh - I"m sorry I disturbed Bryan- I’ll be out of your hair in a minute”. 

It was more like two minutes that I was out of the building - we didn’t talk again. 

Normally I don’t have much interaction with Bryan, so I was surprised when, up to my eyeballs calculating vacation pay, I got an email from him the next day from a gmail account. "We cool?”

I didn’t answer- I didn’t want to leave any trace of communication. 

But then when I got to work the following day, he followed me to my office, and as I reached my desk he stood by my door and said in a low voice, "Kirsten- you’re not going to tell anyone are you?”

I shuffled the files on my desk “No.” 

“It’s just you didn’t answer my email yesterday.”

I looked up and smiled brightly. "It’s ok Bryan. I won’t tell. I really need to start my day please”

He nodded. "Thanks. I owe you one.”

"That’s not necessary” I replied. My phone rang, I glanced down- my husband’s smiling face flashed on my screen. "Sorry Bryan- I’ve got to take this, it’s my husband”.  

He nodded again, and thank god he left my office. 

I knew of course I had to talk to my manager about Bryan - but the call from my husband distracted me, and then work was piling up, there’s always so much - and well, I didn’t mention Bryan. And, ironically enough as I had barely noticed Bryan before, I kept running into him everywhere. Whenever I went to get a coffee or to the washroom- he seemed to be in the way, looking at me with a desperate question, and now I could see the signs, the unkempt hair, the wrinkled shirt, the fuzzy face, and I just couldn’t deal with it. 

For I had increasing troubles of my own. I had said "husband", but "ex”, or "soon-to-be-ex” would have been more accurate. We were going through separation, and it was rapidly turning into hell on earth. It’s a cliche, but I would have never thought someone I had loved so much could become so cruel.

It got so bad that I offered to my manager to take on processing all the additional COVID days everybody was taking, telling her I needed the overtime as I was saving up for a big vacation. She was delighted- we had been short-staffed and the sick pay was accruing, she got an exception for me to remain in the office and work extra hours until the backlog was cleared. I was so happy that I didn’t have to spend long miserable evenings home and I actually had forgotten about Bryan, which really spoke volumes to what I was going through, as he was always in my line of sight, one way or the other. 

It happened the first evening I was staying overtime. Bryan waved to me as I headed into my office with my last coffee of the day, but we didn’t talk. I closed my door and I was soon immersed in the work, which was finicky and detailed and all-consuming, when I heard the shattering of glass.  

Of course I immediately knew what it was. I started fumbling for my phone.

He was at my office door screaming before I could do anything useful. I looked at his twisted furious face, and my visceral fear of having a large angry man screaming at me became tempered with the desperate sad desire to find some trace of the man I had loved. 

My silent stare seemed to infuriate him even more and he lunged towards me. 

Before he reached me, Bryan dashed in and shoved him sideways using only his body as a weapon. The attack took him by surprise, and he faltered. Then he looked at Bryan, looked back at me, his anger visibly seemed to swell to a different dimension. He effortlessly leapt at Bryan’s throat, taking him down. 

But the distraction was useful. I called 911, and then just before Bryan went completely still under his throttling hands, I swiped my stapler -the big heavy one used for stapling 50+ sheets- at his head as hard as I could. 

He fell like a stone on top of Bryan, blood blossoming out of the wound in his head. I looked down at the two unconscious men, then picked up my phone and completed my call.

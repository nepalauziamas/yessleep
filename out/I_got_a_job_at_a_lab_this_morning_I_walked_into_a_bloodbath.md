Recently, I scored a job at this lab that was about 15 minutes away from my home. The pay was good, and I was experienced in the field of lab work,so I decided to give it a shot.

On my first day, things were going well, I was assigned to take notes on a specimen that my fellow co-workers were observing. Just as the observation was about to wrap up, sirens across the lab started blaring, and everybody rushed out immediately.  I was about to follow, but I was pushed back and told “no, you wait here”
I was thinking “what the hell is going on?” Then, everyone came back, looking scared and shaken.

“Is everything ok?” I asked one of my co-workers.

“One of the specimens in the more…. Secure area of the lab almost escaped.
It broke thorough it’s containment area and was severely close to breaking down the exit doors in the area.”

“Is everything ok now?” I said, scared shitless.

“Yeah.” He said. “We got it back into its containment and reinforced the exit doors, so there shouldn’t be any more incidents.”

“Ok, that’s a relief” I said. But I’m my head I thought: “what if it escapes completely?”

My shift was coming to a close, and everyone seemed to be doing a lot better than before, so I packed up my things, headed out to my car, and made my way home.

I came home and was greeted by my dog Luke, who always has a big smile on his face when he sees me, I gave him the usual pets, then headed upstairs to wash up and go to sleep.

The next morning, I woke up to Luke, licking my face and wagging his tail, the usual morning greeting. “Quit it boy, I love you too but I’m nice and clean and I don’t need slobber and doggy hair all over me” I chuckled.
I made myself a cup of coffee, said my goodbyes to Luke, and drove to work.

When I arrived at the lab, I noticed the lights were off. “That’s odd, someone should be here by now.” I got out of my car and slid my keycard into the door to get it open.

When I arrived into the lab, it was still empty, but I noticed a horrible smell, as if something was rotting. 

I made it to the lab division where I worked, and as I opened the door, I almost threw up.

All over the floor, were mutilated corpses, so wretched, I couldn’t tell who they were.

Then I saw the name tags.

These corpses were all of my coworkers. Before I could even process what had happened, a horrible scream that sounded like a wailing animal, came from a room near me. As it approached close to where I was, I saw that it was no fucking animal.

This thing walked on all fours, and twisted its neck every time it took a step, and had no eyes.I screamed and ran as fast as I could out of there. As it was close behind me, I managed to make it out of there just before it slammed against the glass door.

“Take that, you fucker!” I yelled. I grabbed my phone and snapped a picture before calling the police, so I had evidence as to what I just witnessed.

The police came, gunned the creature down, and wheeled out the bodies of my coworkers. I was lost for words and I realized just how many people this thing had killed.

That night, as I sat down with Luke on the couch, I saw the story of what happened today on the news. They were doing a thorough search of the lab and conducting investigations.

I just hope there isn’t anything else in that “secure” part of the lab.

The darkness called as the sun-burnt leaves rustled on the ground, some invisible creature burrowing or hunting. I could feel the lick of the gentle breeze against my cheek while the sound of the beating heart resonated in my ears, thumping louder and louder, making the sounds of the forest feel like a distant hum. It wasn't until I realized that the beating heart wasn't my own, but rather that of him, the one who was sent to guide me home, that I truly felt at peace for once.

I had spent the summer at my brother's cabin, having lost my job and no prospects in sight for the near future. I needed the break after years of hard labor and mental torment. My wife decided it best to divorce me, finally freeing me from the shackles of her wretched games, but leaving me beaten and bruised, not visibly, but certainly. The factory closing was just the icing on the cake that was my pathetic little life. Once summer hit, I was so frail that I had no will left in me. So I left the few big things I had on the side of the road, threw some clothes and personal items into a garbage bag, and hopped into my rust bucket of a car, hoping it could sputter its way to the cabin. It was only a three hour drive, but the faint sound of the engine knocking and the loud buzz of the likely rusted through exhaust pipes had me on edge the entire way. The radio faded to static within the first hour, and the only other option being cassette, I was forced to ride the remainder of the trip with only the sounds indicating the death of machinery to keep me occupied.

Some time around the two hour mark, I pulled off the side of the road to relieve myself, leaving the car running to ease my own anxiety about getting it started again. The sputtering of the engine from the tall grass sounded even more desperate, like a man whose throat has been slashed, blood gushing from the jugular, drowning in his own fluids. That last hour of the drive left me in a state of complete and utter despair, nothing to free my mind from its own prison of thoughts. By the time I got to the cabin, I had tears running down my face, leaving little streaks in the dirt stained skin. You'd be surprised how filthy you can get driving down a dirt road with the windows open, having AC that hasn't functioned properly since the Berlin wall fell. I flailed my arm around over the back seat, reaching for the black plastic bag that contained everything I had left to my name, hoping to grab a shirt or something soft to wipe my face with.

My brother was immediately shocked and appalled by my appearance, having last seen me a year prior when I was still working, still married, and still eating. My last real meal was on the night my wife threw the papers at me, just after doing the dishes. She had waited in silence, all through dinner, before finally exploding, screaming in a rage that would rival that of a demonic presence. It was the big final showdown of our failed life together, a true representation of our relationship as it had become. I cowered in the corner, sitting at the kitchen table as small and feeble as possible, hoping she would just finish and leave. It went on for what felt like a lifetime, but was probably only ten minutes in reality. When those papers hit the table, I was met with a strange sense of relief wrapped in anguish. I knew it was best for me, considering the level of abuse I had dealt with for the past few years, but I also felt like I had nothing left to move on to. She sucked every bit of happiness from me, leaving me an empty husk of a person with nothing left to give, nothing left to feel but utter sadness. She drove away every friend I had, every confidant, every family member who tried to rescue me time and time again. They all saw it, no matter how hard we tried to hide it. She was evil incarnate and managed to hide it from me just long enough to hook me and get me under her spell.

The day after she left, I was so utterly shattered from all of it that I could barely function and just wanted to let myself whither away to nothing. I had to force myself to take a shower and get ready for work, even if it felt like I was a complete zombie the entire time. It was like I was on auto-pilot and had no control over my own actions. I just knew I had to keep going, keep pretending to live whatever life I had left in me, if only for the sake of everyone else. Walking into my work space to find a note to go see Brent in HR normally would have sent me into a panic, but on that day, I was so dazed that it didn't affect me at all. I sat down across from Brent at his desk and pretended to listen as he explained something I wasn't in the mood to care about. He handed me a folder with a paper on top that was titled "Severance Package" and told me I had a few minutes to look it over, then walked out shutting the door behind him. I stared blankly at the paper, the words out of focus, blurred into one big blob of jumbled letters. The paper started vibrating, and that's when I realized I was laughing, maniacally and loudly. Brent hurriedly opened the door and peeked in, asking if I was okay. I just turned, looking at him while still laughing and shaking my head violently. He disappeared again and within moments, came back with a security guard, who grabbed my arm and lifted me out of the chair, walking me out of Brent's office. As he guided me to the front doors, Brent followed, informing me that my termination will be immediate and they will mail all the information about my severance. I continued laughing, having no control over myself at that point, feeling like my world had imploded on itself all at once.

I sat, a plate of grilled chicken with rice and beans placed in front of me, staring at it like it was something foreign that I had never before seen. My brother sat, same plate in front of him, with dried tear streaks down his charcoal soot covered face. We both ate without saying a single word the entire time, only the sounds of the forest seeping through the open window above the kitchen sink. I had taken a few bites before breaking down into full body sobs. I dropped my fork onto the table with a clank, and sat with my hands over my face sobbing heavily. My brother quickly joined me in unison, more streaks running down his face, leaving little blackish droplets on the edge of his white plate. We sat like that for a few minutes before letting the feelings subside and went back to eating quietly. Once we were done with our dinner, I started collecting the dishes to wash them when my brother grabbed them and insisted that I sit while he take care of the dishes. I had been through enough, according to him, and did not have to do any of that anymore. I once again started sobbing heavily, managing to squeak out a "thank you" between labored breaths. I could see my brother trying to hold back full on sobs while washing the plates and silverware at the kitchen sink, breeze blowing his hair a little to the side. I got up out of the chair and walked over by his side, placing a hand on his shoulder, and thanked him again, at which point he dropped the fork he was washing and hugged me tightly. We both let out wails while squeezing each other tightly. After a few minutes, we let go and backed up. I could see on his face the same thing I was feeling myself, a feeling of clarity and relief. Sometimes all it takes is a good cry.

As the little remaining sunlight beamed through the trees, I stepped over naturally piled leaves that had fallen after being beaten on by the sun for the past couple months. The air was slightly warm, but the small gusts swirling around had a crispness that was refreshing, subsiding the tiny beads of sweat that had accumulated on my forehead during the short jog I had taken. When I felt the hand wrap around my forearm, I stopped at a startle and whipped around to find him standing there, wrapped in a dark robe and mask covering his face. He guided me down to my knees and in a voice that can only be described as toneless, he told me it was time. I had completed this journey and it was time to move on to the next. The breeze kissed my cheek as he placed his hand on top of my head, pushing it down into a bow. He asked me to listen closely, to take in everything and nothing all at once. I didn't understand at first, but it slowly came to me as I knelt quietly, letting everything soak in. And then nothing. Everything and nothing all at once. I understood. There was nothing. I was nothing. But it was everything that made me know I was nothing and there was nothing. In that moment of clarity, I saw the universe as it is. Without touching me, he lifted me back to my feet, putting his arms around me and squeezing me tightly. I could feel the heart beating, thumping in, no not in, but on my chest. It was his heart, and it was strong. I had a brief thought in my mind, but before I could speak, the answer came to me. He released me, whispering in my ear. The words that were said were of little comfort, but they left me with a sense of peace regardless.

I walked into the bedroom where my brother was lying in bed, napping peacefully. I wanted to beg, plead for him to leave and come back some other time, but he insisted without saying a word. His hand in the air was the signal for me. As I lifted my arm, I felt a tear run down my cheek, the cool air from the open window behind me sending a chill down my spine. He turned to me and made a noise that still gives me nightmares, impatiently wanting, expecting for me to act on his behalf. I again begged, but with every passing second, he grew more and more impatient, moving closer and closer, breathing his stench in my face, tingling my nostrils. Another tear streamed down my face as I squeezed my finger, only feeling, not hearing, and then I stood alone, silent and cold. I watched as the red pool beneath the pillow grew larger, the smell of iron wafting under my nose as the air swirled around me.

I awoke to the sound of that thing screaming at me, the stench of its breath lingering in the air. No, I thought, it is not my time. He said this would save me. He said this would give me my life back. I'll never know if I should have trusted him, or if this is all a nightmare. My wife is still asleep, but the smell, how can she not wake up from that smell?

Fucking hell.

Parties and raves had never been my forte. Friends had to always drag me down to these goddamn shitty joints. I never wanted to go, yet somehow I ended up there. Surrounded by naked chicks and sometimes guys and maybe other kinds of people and creatures —I can’t really remember most of the parties I’ve gone to— and fucking high and drunk out of mind, I cursed the next day when I felt basically like shit.

Noah and Jake, my degenerate best two friends, called me and told me about this rave. They had three invitations to what they said to be a very sought-after party. They even told me that the number of invites was pretty low, only ninety-nine. Of course, these shitheads didn’t get any invitation. They managed to win them at a game of 8-ball in a so-called bar; it was a helluva dump. I still don’t know what business they had there, but a win is a win. They would have been $1000 short if they had lost the game.

Word on the street had it that with one day remaining until the rave, the price for one of these would go north of $2.5k. So we’ve had seven and a half grand worth of party. Fucking crazy.

But, like the degenerates I already said we were, the prospect of going became more enticing. The mystery that surrounded the party was unreal and out of this world. People in select circles talked about it like it was some sort of Illuminati gathering.

Jesus Christ on a fucking stick. I didn’t know why the hell this party messed me up to that degree. I didn’t fucking wanted to go. But those two dickwads insisted so much that they probably came in their pants when I said yes.

“Fucking fine! You two are like two stupid geriatric teenagers. You know that?” I yelled at them. “Where the fuck is this shit?”

“I don’t know the location, my bruv,” Noah said.

“How about I locate deez nutz across ya face, ya bloody good-for-nothing twat?” I replied, angered.

“Hey, man? The fuck is wrong with you, why are you so angry?” Jake intervened. “That grandpa guy from the bar told us we was gonna get a text message with the location.”

“So you both gave your phone numbers, and I assume your names to a fucking guy whom you’ve never met? Fuckin’ bloody brilliant, mate. Good fucking job.”

“I never met anyone who says fuck so much. You’re unfuckin’ real, my bruv,” Noah replied.

“Up yours, fuckface,” I said, sticking my middle finger in his face. “You got some weed, though? I wanna get fried before going to sleep tonight.”

“Why, of course, dear sir. Would you like me to stick it up your arsheole, or do you prefer to smoke it the regular way?” Jake asked, taking a bow and handing me a big fat blunt.

We all burst into laughter and, as such, we started the party earlier. Booze and weed and weed and booze. Vodka, whisky, wine, we made a fucking mess of ourselves.

Then, after nightfall, all our phones chimed at the same time. 

“What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu….. hahahahahhahahaha………… You fucking gave them… my name too? My name too! My name is Jonathan McFuck Off Ya Fuckin Punks! Hahahaha,” I said, laughing uncontrollably. “Where the fuck is this place?” 

“At this point, I can’t even tell if I have ten or twelve fingers on each hand. Noah, you’re fresher than us, call a fucking thing,what do you call it? When it comes and takes you from one place to another? Is that a fucking alligator?” Jake said, pointing to the ceiling.

“Weed,” Jake said. 

“Fuck’s sake, man. Focus. Like the thing on wheels?” Noah asked again.

“Car?”

“No!”

“Taxi?”

“Fuck no!”

“Bolt?”

“No, you’re doing my fuckin’ head in, I swear to God. You’re making me nervous, Jake. Making me agitated!”

“A Bolt?”

“Yes! That’s it, you fucking genius! Let’s call a Bolt!”

“Hi! Bolt for Jake?” the driver of the black car pulled over behind us said. “Hop on in, guys, let me take you to the party. You’re the tenth order I got today!”

How the fuck did that guy arrive so fast? We were so stoned.

“Dude, where the hell did you come from so fast?” Noah asked.

“From your worst nightmares, and you’re going to die, boys! So buckle up, it’s gonna be a bumpy ride!” the driver said. He didn’t have a face, yet he looked at us. He didn’t have a mouth, yet he spoke to us.

He turned over and I saw that he wore a mask with a smile made of human blood and his eyes dripping.

“What the fuck is going on?! What did you just say?” Noah asked, his arms shaking like worms in a can.

“I said I sat parked behind that house, and your address popped on my screen,” the driver replied. He couldn’t have been older than twenty-five years old or so. Very polite too. The weed gave us a bad trip. Everything spun as the car’s silent engine purred like a fat cat near a fireplace. Millions of stars filled the sky outside, and I rolled the window down and tried to grab them.

“Hey, the monster outside likes to eat human arms. So put them back inside!” the driver exclaimed.

“What?”

“I said don’t do that. It’s dangerous,” the driver replied calmly.

Bad fucking weed.

He dropped us off somewhere outside town in a shitty field. It seemed like another world. A small, abandoned metal building stood before us. Muffled music came from within, but we couldn’t determine exactly where the party was. 

Two big men came outside. They had guns, and black rags covered their faces.

“You here for party. Give invitation,” one of them said with a solid Eastern-European accent. “Also, show text message on phones.”

We did just that.

“Where's the party, though?” I asked.

“Inside, under earth. You go down, and when you see red door you knock. Blonde girl answer and gives you blood cocktail. You drink or die. Ok, go,” the other dude said.

“But…” Jake tried to say something.

“Go, or I shoot you,” they both said in unison.

I wished these were hallucinations. We went inside and descended a set of small stairs. This fucking shit was all wrong; we shouldn’t have gone to that place. After a few minutes, we walked down the stairs and saw the red door. Noah knocked three times.

The blonde girl the bodyguards spoke about answered the door. She flashed a welcoming smile with mesmerizing green eyes and red lipstick and then handed us the cocktails. We played along and downed them in an instant.

Inside, people danced frantically to the beats of bewildering goth industrial music. They looked like they were in some kind of trance, not caring about anything or anyone. The room spun in circles with me, and I felt dizzier with each passing second. The cocktail must’ve been more potent than my will to turn back and go home.

People with face paint stared at me. Some of them had shiny teeth. Some had a red liquid dripping slowly in small rivers. Someone licked my neck, and a tingling sensation went down my spine.

“Dude, where the fuck’s Jake?” Noah asked.

“Fuck if I know, bruv. Maybe he hooked up or something,” I replied, inebriated. My mind raced, and my heart went up in my throat. 

The music was intoxicating too. The smoky room had a magic touch, but I also felt things were tense and wrong. Maybe paranoia had gotten the best of me at that moment, but I swear I saw a man showing me his freshly polished canine teeth.

“Alright, people and other creatures! So who’s ready to put the rave in graveyard?” the DJ asked loudly. 

The room went berserk. The beasts screamed, and many jumped the living persons feeding their off necks. 

“What the fuuuuuuck?” Noah screamed. 

When I turned around, one of those fucking things with pointy ears sucked the blood from his neck. Noah died little by little and gasped for air. He looked at me to help him, but I stood frozen. Finally, when the thing finished feeding, it broke his neck and threw him against a wall. I screamed when his lifeless eyes looked at me in shock and disbelief.

The room spun ever so fast, and nothing made any sense. One of my friends lay dead on the dance floor, and the other one had vanished without a trace. From the ceiling, sprinklers showered everyone in blood. The victims and the perpetrators swayed to different types of dances. The living fell into the clutches of the monsters. The beasts hissed and sucked until humans turned into nothing but raisins. Desanguinated, some of them were as frail and thin as leaves.

In front of me, Jake appeared. His head hung low and twitching. He tried to speak to me.

“Man, this is the best shit ever. Let’s get fucking high on these peasants!” he exclaimed, raising his head to look at me.

Madness filled his bloodshot eyes. Now only the empty shell of a body once human, the beast in front of me, had fangs. Coagulated dark red blood adorned Jake’s face, and he still seemed hungry. 

“Dude, Jake. You don’t have to do this, man. Think about it and take a good fucking look at Noah, bruv. Look what they turned him into. A pile of dead meat and broken bones. It’s a fucking bloodbath in here, mate,” I replied.

“Fuck you and fuck Noah, you fucking thieves. Don’t you think I know that you stole from me countless times?” Jake said and lunged at me. I ducked and ran as fast as I could.

The DJ pumped the music louder, the bass made the room tremble, and blood droplets danced on the floor. Everyone and everything partied, the living and the dead, the traces of humanity and inanimate objects too. For some, it was a celebration, a feast if you’d like. But, others embraced death, keeping them close to its chest while its minions fed on their blood.

Throughout all the frenzy, pain, and death, I found another door in the back of the room. Jake found another man and fed on him.

“Oh, I’ll get you too, you fucking bastard,” he said.

I almost ran through the door and found myself in a long tunnel. The music lost its volume and the bass its intensity. The party of the damned was in full swing, but I couldn’t stay any longer. Noah’s facial expression stood with me the whole way. I managed to reach the end of the tunnel, and I heard the beast screaming ravenously behind me. 

I found myself outside now, in the middle of nowhere. Yet, I heard cars passing by somewhere in the distance. A road must have been close to me. Maybe a kind soul would take me to town so I can hide in a church or something like that. Desperation clawed its way inside my soul, and all that was rational and logical things I once knew vanished in the blink of an eye. 

A car almost ran me over before hitting the brakes. I begged the driver to take me somewhere safe. I told him someone tried to kill me, and he said he knew.

The driver turned around. Fuckin’ Jake. I tried jumping out of the car but to no avail.

“I repeat, no one is trying to kill you, man. You just had a bad weed experience. How about you sleep, and I’ll take you home safe and sound?” Jake asked, grinning.

I felt my eyelids getting heavy. It was as if he had hypnotized me into doing what he asked me.

“Please, don’t hurt me, man. This is not you,” I said.

“Sure thing, dude. Go to sleep. You’ll be home in no time. You just had a bad night, is all. Good night and sweet dreams, see you on the other side,” Jake concluded.

Back in 2022, Saudi Arabia's government announced they are building a city that's incredibly thin, easy to access, and has no effect on the environment. For the next 15 years, they were building that city in the middle of the country. When it was finished, me and my family moved here in hopes of a better future for our bloodline. However we could not afford a home that is near the top with lots of sunshine and a better community. We had to live near the bottom. Generally it was fine, the city's funding supported us and most of our neighbors were really nice. I managed to get a job only a 10 minute walk away from my house, and it also payed well. 

Fast forward to today. The city has been expanding in both directions every single day, and because it was more spread out with the same resources and funds, the top had a better life. Every day our little region at the bottom becomes worse and worse. The police force don't care to solve crimes here. The materials that get sent down here are really bad, like groceries, clothing, plumbing, water, etc. The tourists all go to the top. The trash piles up on the streets. Worst of all, we cant leave. Slowly and quietly, The government closed off all ways into the lower levels by building a second "floor" right above us, closing off sunlight and making ways onto the surface really hard. Gangs pile up on the little entrances we have, charging too much for any of us to afford. Most jobs closed off in the bottom due to the conditions, leaving all of us with no work and no money. As you can tell, it's horrible here.

But I was determined to leave. I was the only one in my family left down here. Last month my job closed off and any little payment I was still getting was finally gone. So finally, I sold my house and set off to find one of these mythical entrances I had heard of. You have to be careful walking outside, because you could be murdered at any moment and the killer would get away with it. 

I had been walking for what seemed like ages, since the public transport had all been wiped out. Eventually I found a small diner with a light inside, the first signs of life for hours. I made sure to have my knife hidden in my hand and looked around the windows to check for people. There was a single bartender inside. As I walked in I made sure to greet him, as a bad reputation would get you killed. "Hello." I had said with a low voice. He hadn't said anything yet, but went I sat down he said, "what would you like, sir." I could tell he was burned out, simply through how he said it. "Your cheapest drink."
He walked off and poured something into a glass. The thing was, I can't just not ask him for help. Everybody here who isn't hiding in their house is out for a reason. "I need to know how to get out of here. I need to get to the higher levels." He sighed. Without turning around, he told me, "That's impossible." But I knew it wasn't. I've seen people escape. "Tell me how to get out! I need to know how. I have a family, atleast I think I do. It's been years since I've seen them, and I have nothing else I can do! I'll pay you, I just sold my house and I have nowhere to go." He waited for a bit, before turning to face me and saying, "Look man, I can get you to the higher level. But if you don't like what you see, I'm not paying you back." 

We entered an abandoned building. This building stretched out all the way to the ceiling. I followed the bartender and once we were inside, he shouted, "MORTIS, WE HAVE ANOTHER FLOORJUMPER." that sentence felt odd to me. Mortis isn't a regular name, and I've never heard of a 'floor jumper' before. It was strange, and before I had time to think a barricaded door burst open and a man who hid most of his face except his eyes had gestured for us to follow him. The bartender told me, "don't be scared of any of these guys. Just remember, don't make eye contact, don't ask questions. All you have to pay them and they'll leave you alone. We walked up a lot of stairs until finally, we made it. A very long room with an elevator at the end. On every wall was a flock of people all dressed as mortis. One, who was taller then the rest and dressed slightly more luxuriously walked in front of me. "If you wish to go up a floor, you must pay me 10 thousand." He said. 10 thousand was a lot, considering I sold my home for 8000. Thankfully I had 2 thousand left from my old job so I gave him all my money. He stepped aside and said, "enter this elevator and press the button for the 23rd floor." I did as he said. As I walked through the crowd I managed to see their jackets. they all said MORTIS and had a skull symbol. Wait a minute. Mortis isn't the name of a person, it's their gang name. I finally entered the elevator and pressed the button. As I watched the 10 meter floor pass me, I realized something. 23rd? My home was at the bottom. Wasn't it? Also, didn't they only make one floor? My body suddenly froze. If there are 21 stories below me, there must be more above me.

As the elevator finally stopped, a mortis member greeted me. As I looked around, I saw something terrifying. This floor looks the exact same. There wasn't a difference. The only difference was that I actually saw people outside, but none looked friendly. I asked the person, "why does this floor look the same? Where is the sun, the plants, the-" I had started to say before he interrupted me. "What year did you last leave your floor." I had struggled to remember. "Ever since they installed the ceiling." "Well, they didn't make a divider. They built more floors. Nobody knows where they stop. Nobody has ever left. There are rumors that the world had suffered another world war and the only place in the world left inhabited is the climate here, so they were forced to expand to fit the whole population."

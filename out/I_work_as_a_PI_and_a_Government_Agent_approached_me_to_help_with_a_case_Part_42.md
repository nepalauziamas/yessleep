I haven’t been getting a lot of sleep lately. Between my brain thinking up new nightmares, and supernatural creatures dropping by the office for different requests, I stayed up most nights. So when Nick called in the dead of night, I was still awake. His message very simple and short. Be by my door as fast as possible. Even when an infection had been raging inside a Hunter lab, he hadn’t rushed me like this. I got ready as fast as I could, and my front door swung open just as I reached for the handle. It smashed my face, knocking me back and causing stars in my vision for a couple seconds. Nick quick to apologize for nearly breaking my nose, but we couldn’t dwell on that. I shook it off, ready to see why he deemed it so urgent to drag me out of the house in the middle of the night. 

We stepped outside and found my door had been connected to a tent opening. It always felt weird entering a door with one shape, only to leave from a different one. We arrived at a campground swarming with agents. I’ve never seen so many at one time and place, not even at The Corporation headquarters. This clearly had to be a very big deal to bring out as many hands as they could get a hold of. I saw some familiar faces in the crowd of people rushing around. We went over to a woman with a clipboard that stood next to a table littered with weapons. Nick already had his sword at his side. She checked off names and handed out weapons very generously to the agents, giving them whatever they wanted to use. I got tempted to take a sword because it was offered, but in the end I stuck with my gun and a lot of magazines. She went through the situation quickly, so us and another pair of agents could hear.

“There are an incredible amount of unidentified creatures in these woods. They are appearing at an alarming rate, and the method through which they are is still unknown. They are dangerous and cannot be allowed to reach the town nearby. The only way to kill them is to destroy the red gem stuck in their forehead. If you are injured, make your way back here for treatment. That is all, now be on your way.” 

She dismissed us to do the task requested. Because I couldn’t see in the dark very well, Nick brought us over to where I could get a charm to see better. The entire place very busy with agents running around, but with no one shouting out orders. Everyone seemed happy to work together and help each other. I had expected The Corporation to be more of a strict operation, run in a military-like fashion; but even in such a stressful situation, everyone acted pretty upbeat. We got stopped by 526 and 706 while still in the busy area. They wanted to hand over a crude map other agents were trying to put together of the woods, and where some of the unknown creatures had been spotted. They directed us to a spot that so far needed to still be looked over. Both still wore the bracelets I’d given them as a good luck charm, but also their nails were painted which I commented on. They proudly stated their older brother painted their nails. They hurried off to take care of their own section of the forest, not worried in the slightest over the threat. But I couldn’t help worry about them a little bit because they weren’t the strongest agents around. 

We couldn’t stand and wait for much longer. I followed behind Nick as we went deeper into the woods. The sounds of the busy camp soon died down leaving only the sounds of our footsteps through the bushes. Why did all these creatures need to appear in the forest all the time? Couldn’t they pick a more accessible spot? Or did they all have a secret meeting to decide to be in the place that creeped me out the most? 

It wasn’t long before we came across a threat. Nick froze and got ready to strike when something moved around in the woods in front of us. Thanks to the spell, I could see pretty clearly in the dark. The creature looked almost human-shaped. My hand tightened on the grip of my gun as I listened, getting ready to shoot if it got closer. A breeze came, bringing the voice of the creature with it. 

“Kill...kill ill...” The words nothing more than a gasp of breath. 

It sounded scary as all hell. Nick wanted to get a clear shot but didn’t get that chance. The creature noticed us, the head literally snapping in our direction. I let out a loud screech that echoed through the air, and it caused other creatures to be alerted to our location. Soon, more forms came crashing through towards us. Nick swung The Orchestra, sending out a shockwave that cut the approaching creature in half. I was busy shooting, trying to take out anything coming closer, but I noticed how subdued the attack sounded from him. Instead of taking out a line of trees, he barely cut through one. 

With a creature nearly on top of me, I tripped over my own feet, raised my gun up to the face of the thing about to bite my face off and got a lucky shot off. The face exploded in what looked to be fragile stone instead of flesh. I got a good look at what we were facing. The bodies had been made of a mixture of human parts, mostly able to stand stably. Clearly flesh and blood, but the heads from the neck up had a blank-faced expression and were made of stone. When they attacked, that sculpted face switched into one of fury. Each one had a red stone of different sizes set somewhere on their forehead. 

One got very close to Nick while his back was turned, so I couldn’t see his expression. My mouth dropped open in shock when he dropped his sword and both of his hands reached out to take the monster by the face as if they knew each other. When his palms made contact, the creature stopped moving. An almost calm expression appeared on its face as the body started to crack and turn to dust, leaving the small fragment of the red stone behind. Nick gripped the small stone in his hands and pressed it to his chest. He fell to his knees, leaning over as if trying to protect what he was holding. With other creatures still moving in trying to kill us, I couldn’t go to him. I needed to do the horrible task of shooting the others to kill them. The head crumbled, but the bodies remained behind after I shot the gem to pieces. Some of the limbs started to fall off as if whatever kept them on loosened after the gems were cracked. 

When I was certain there wasn’t anything lurking in the woods ready to attack us, I rushed to my partner’s side. I’ve never seen him like this before. He couldn’t even raise his head.  

“They’re stones. Fragmented, broken stones...” He said in a low hurt voice. 

It felt terrible seeing him like this. Just as terrible as the fact that whatever I had just killed, was in some way the same as himself. Pieces of failed Philosopher stones grafted onto bodies, keeping them together. Nick wasn’t a perfect stone, but he still held a human form. The things in the woods couldn’t even do that. 

“Nickie, I'm sorry. I killed some.” I said, my throat closing up knowing what I’d done. 

He shook his head, finally meeting my eyes and looking glad they had died.  

“They’re suffering. It's the only way to save them.”  

He opened his hands to look at the crumbled stone, his palms shaking slightly. Nick felt incredibly angry and showing it. He wouldn’t forgive whoever created these fragments and allowed them to suffer. The whispers weren’t threats, but instead were begging others to kill them. I also became very pissed off on their behalf.  

Shots came from nearby. We weren’t the only ones fighting these stones. I could only hope the other agents killed them quickly and without causing them to suffer too much. Nick stood up, his hand on his sword again. The look on his face revealed just how angry he gotten. It was a look that didn’t suit my kind partner.  

A burst of movement came through the woods. More of those stones leapt, ready to attack, and Nick moved so fast I couldn’t see his actions. He sent a shockwave, cutting down the three that appeared from the shadows, his anger intended towards whoever made them. We both saw these monsters as victims. 

With my gun, I could help take out whatever stones we came across almost as fast as he did. We both kept an eye out for any other agents in order to keep them out of friendly fire, but also for any signs of who had created this entire mess. Almost an hour into the fighting, the ground shook, causing us to both hunker down and wait for it to stop. 

Overhead, the sky changed. I watched in awe as a reflective dark blue light started to cover the entire forest. Nick wasn’t too concerned over such an unnatural sight. 

“It’s a barrier to ensure the stones stay inside the forest, and to keep the humans in the town nearby from seeing anything.” He explained, having seen such a thing happen before. “However, I do not know what caused the earthquake.” 

As if to answer him, the world shook again, this time from a bellowing cry so powerful it rattled the trees and everything else around us. My ears rung from it and I couldn’t hear if Nick said anything. It took a few minutes for my hearing to return. What we saw through the leaves made us forget about the possible blown eardrums. 

A shape burst upwards from far away, so massive we could see it immediately. A mass of dull red wings, all tangled into each other. Most were sticking out, creating a ball of the feathers. A hint of a glowing light came from the middle of it all. Thin lines shot out; a hand made up of countless intertwined others reached into the woods searching for something. It was hard to see from the distance, but I could have sworn those hands swept up and grabbed the smaller fragmented creatures to drag them inside the larger body.  

This was bad. Whatever that thing was, it would be too big to fight. My guns were useless against such a threat. At least there were other agents loaded with magic and weapons. We needed to stay away and only fight the smaller creatures in the woods. Watching as the ball of wings started to move away, I considered this might be an end of the world sort of situation. Anything this large might as well be one. To my shock, Nick started to move towards the massive threat. I grabbed his wrist before he got too far. We needed to stay back, no matter what he knew that I didn’t. 

With regret on his face, he nodded in agreement. We started to move away and towards the camp to see if we would get some new orders or be told what was going on. We never made it. 

Just when my hearing returned, someone grabbed my neck from behind. I stopped, startled. The cold barrel of a gun pressed against my temple and I couldn’t turn my head to see who just taken me hostage.  

“I was lucky to find you two. Now, drop your weapons and come with me or else your partner gets their brain blown out.” A raspy voice from behind spoke. 

Nick stopped, a stern expression on his face. He carefully set down his sword, but I hadn’t dropped my gun. Something wet soaked through the back of my shirt from where I pressed against the mystery person. The arm wrapped around my neck was covered in dried blood. A small flicker of an expression from Nick told me what I needed to know. I could fight this person. Letting out a scream, I pushed back hard. 

Both of us slammed against a tree, the other person gasping for air. I snatched the gun from him, ready to fight him some more, only to see my attacker slumped over. His front half was also covered in blood from an open gash. He'd been bluffing and weak. Not really an impressive victory on my end. 

“Damn, I really thought that would work.” He coughed. 

He looked older, wearing glasses and dressed in a stained lab coat. The gun he held was the first his hands had ever touched. He was not the kind of person who should be out in the woods dealing with monsters. 

“You’re human.” Nick said as he took a few steps forwards. “Most likely a Hunter. Did you do all this?” 

I got between them not really liking the tone of my partner. Nick might be angry enough to hurt this man even more. We needed some answers and then he could do what he wanted. 

“Ding ding. Pretty smart for a rock.” The Hunter chuckled, clutching his chest after. 

Nick flinched as if he got smacked in the face. Insults had never really gotten to him before. Tonight, his emotions were so on edge almost anything could get under his skin. Pushing past me, he walked over to swiftly kick the man directly over the wound. Such a violent act was something I never though Nick would do. The Hunter shouted in pain as another kick found his jaw. Groaning and coughing up blood, he couldn’t move when Nick got down low. I was also frozen, not able to stop whatever he was about to do. 

Scratching came from the dirt as Nick started to draw something in front of the man. Confused, we watched him as he placed one of his long hairs in the middle of the complex circle he’d drawn in seconds. The hair and circle glowed red, Nick grabbed the light in his fingertips and drove it directly into the still bleeding wound. 

With a lot of cursing and thrashing, the Hunter tried pushing Nick’s hand away. When he pulled back The Hunter turned, needing to throw up from the pain. Nick’s hand held a shard of bloody metal I guessed had come from inside the man’s chest. He looked awful and still couldn’t stand up. But at least he wasn’t dying. 

“Couldn’t you heal me in a nicer way?” The Hunter choked, sitting up against the tree again. 

Nick just stared down, the metal dripping blood in his hand in a very threatening manner. It could be returned where he found it if he didn’t get the answers he wanted. 

Another distant roar came from the mass of wings. The man paled, with sweat breaking out on his face. 

“We may have made a mistake.” He admitted. 

That was an understatement. We both waited, expecting him to go on. Knowing there wasn’t any way around it, he sighed, starting to say what happened. 

“There is a hidden underground lab nearby. Destroyed now, after we lost control of those fragments. They were just tests. The real goal was to create a perfect stone. That big mess was the nearest we’d gotten.” He said, needing to pause between words. 

“There is no such thing as a perfect stone.” Nick corrected, clutching his hands into fists. 

“I beg to differ. We’ve heard reports about you. An unfinished stone The Corporation would never admit to having. But you’re not unfinished, are you? Is that why you’re looking down at me with such hate in those dark eyes? You’re disgusted by these imperfect imitations?’  

As he spoke, the Hunter started to half stand, his voice pitching up in glee over being in front of something he'd worked so hard to recreate. The ground rumbled under our feet. A battle against that imperfect stone had started, close enough to hear. Each roar making the leaves tremble. 

“It’s crying.” 

Nick’s voice so quiet it almost wasn’t heard over the sounds of the distant fighting. He never wanted another person to go through what he did. Nor, did he ever want another stone to be created. Perfect or otherwise.  

“What’s the point of all this?” My partner demanded. 

The Hunter’s face faltered for a moment. He was unaware of the fact those fragments could feel anything. It shook his world view, but only for a moment. 

“Resurrection. Something only a stone can do. Not even magic can bring back the dead.” 

We stayed silent after his answer. Nick looked away, his few isolated memories of his past haunting him. He'd been used to bring back someone before. I couldn't bring myself to ask much about it knowing how much it hurt him. Even with a stone, you couldn't bring back a person for free. The cost often outweighed the benefit. Seeing how many of the fragments had already suffered, this time the cost without a doubt wasn’t worth the end goal. 

“I don’t care how much you miss someone; do you have any idea what you’ve done?! What if The Corporation didn’t get here in time and those fragments arrived in town? People could have died! You're risking agents’ lives over this, not to mention whatever damage that imperfect stone might still do!” I yelled, more than pissed off in the moment. 

The Hunter laughed, coughing a little, showing Nick really held back on healing him. 

“Agent’s lives? Do you think I give a shit about supernatural creatures dying?! And the town? You dare bring that up?! How many humans have creatures slaughtered! Taking out a few agents is a bonus! I can only hope that imperfect stone keeps going and finishes off this rotten world! Our combined research can be sent to guide other Hunters in a different world to be even closer to our real goal.” 

I wanted to punch him. Holding back, I let him do his villain monologue for a little bit longer. Reaching into his ruined lab coat, he brought out a very small vial. It almost appeared empty when he turned it, showing a single piece of silver hair. 

“Other Hunters are going to come by to pick this up. A piece of hair of the original Silver King. Something not a single creature can touch. Our perfect weapon against you, and what we can use to bring back the first King. The one who was turned on by his subjects and became a tool for creatures to use. A King that loves humans more than his own subjects. And one that can wipe you all out with the blink of an eye. After seeing the horrors you’ve done to humans while he’s been gone, he’ll side with us, finally removing every creature from- Hey!” 

Reaching over, I took the vial from his hand. He looked shocked that I could touch it, let alone take it from him. The hunters never considered I was human that worked for The Corporation. When he recovered, it was far too late. I put the vial in my pocket, to be turned in to the higher ups later. Nick being between us easily held the injured man back. Now that we knew what was going on, we needed a plan. The Hunter thrashed around, trying to get the vial back. 

Nick landed a swift punch in the man's face and it cracked with such force that it showed how personal he took the creation of the other stones.  

The Hunter crumpled to the ground, nose freshly bleeding. I really seemed to be a bad influence on Nick.  

Footsteps caused us to raise our weapons. Nick ducked down to grab his sword again. A startled 526 and 706 walked out from between the trees. They were a bit scuffed up, but not overly harmed. They looked at the knocked out human covered in blood wondering what was going on. We explained and asked a favor of them. 

Nick wrote some notes to be handed off to the higher ups back at the camp. We asked them to bring back The Hunter so we could carry on to the bigger fight. Both were glad to help. 706’s eyes kept darting around and one of his arms was tucked under his jacket. I thought he might be hurt, but he meekly showed a small brown rabbit being carefully held in one arm. These two should really be put in a safe spot and not forced to go near the rampaging imperfect stone.  

With the Hunter handed off to be questioned further, we started towards the bigger fight. If Nick could crumble the fragments, then maybe he would be able to take care of the bigger stone-based creature. Along the way we came across more of the fragments, slowing us down. One got a lucky cut across my cheek. When they were taken down, Nick made us take a break so he could quickly put a band aid over my cut, even though I told him it was fine.  

“Can you wait here for a second?” He asked. 

Placing his sword against a tree, he started up a slight hill. The battle sounded so close we didn’t have the time to stop. And him setting down his weapon was confusing, but I trusted my partner far too much to question it.  

“We need to kill the imperfect stone. I believe it’s been activated in order to try and bring back the Silver King. Being imperfect, it cannot create the magic needed for such a thing and is absorbing everything in sight. If we don’t stop it, the entire world will be taken.” Nick explained.  

“Do are have to kill the stone? I mean, is there any way to change it? Or something like that?” I asked looking up at him. 

His eyes landed on mine and a smile came to his face. One that told me the answer. We couldn’t do anything for the stone besides killing it before it hurt too many other people. I still found myself wanting to try. A loud crash came through the trees, making me cry out a warning to Nick. One of those long strands of interconnected arms was heading right for him. He didn’t move out of the way. To my horror, Nick let himself get scooped up. Grabbing his sword, I ran after him. Soon, his body disappeared through the leaves to be dragged back to the main body of the imperfect stone. 

I cursed him for fooling me like that. Once I got him back, he would get a very strong talking to. Coming out from the trees, I literally ran into the fight. The huge tangle of wings was in the middle, the arms reaching out to grab agents off the ground around it. The sounds of the fight were nearly deafening. So much magic was being tossed around it made the air crackle. Bullets let loose into the mass of wings to no result. I realized just how small and powerless I was. Armed with only a handgun and a sword, I couldn’t do much when so many agents threw magic strong enough to take out small cities. I saw one about to be taken away and swung The Orchestra without thinking. It knocked the hands back long enough for the agents’ partner to get him out of there. But something was wrong. The Orchestra felt weak. Very weak. 

I focused on the sword not feeling that much of power from it. It trembled in my hand from exhaustion. When we fought in the woods, Nick didn’t use it that much. I never would have guessed it was because his sword had gotten tired out. I couldn't risk using it again. One more forced attack might hurt the sword. I moved over to a tree that was still standing and then stuck The Orchestra in the dirt simply because the scabbard went with Nick. Taking out the ruby charm he gave me so long ago, I hooked it to the hilt. I could feel the sword felt angry it would be left behind, but it calmed slightly by being given the trinket.  

“I’ll get him back.” I told the sword. 

I could only hope no other agent saw it and tried to use it when I left. I didn’t really have a plan. I didn’t want to be grabbed the same way Nick did. That would put me at the mercy of the creature. I needed to get inside of the ball of wings on my own terms. There were some cracks between them, but they shifted closed pretty quickly. The only opening that stayed clear was near the top of the ball, so I needed to climb up there somehow. Nick was going to be pissed I was yet again going to jump into the mouth of a creature, but he was to blame this time. 

I ran, not knowing how I would pull this off, when something caught my arm. A grip so strong it pulled me off my feet, and a claw tore my shirt.  

“Human! This is no place for you! Get back to camp!” 

Ancaer had spotted the very weak human contract worker in the crowd. He kept the hand on my arm, some blood seeping through his fingers from the cut his claw accidentally made. 

“Nick is in there! I need to get to him!” I shouted back, tugging at my arm. 

Ancaer’s eyes grew wide as he stared at the monster his agents fought. His name got called out asking for assistance. A long moment passed as his grip loosened. He turned away, wordlessly giving permission for my crazy idea. I took off again, ducking between magic and somehow not getting struck as I got closer to the towering monster. 

One of its long arms got shot away, smoking and retreating back to the main body. Not thinking, I jumped on its side and clung to it as it rose off the ground, the arm not noticing the hitchhiker. I just needed to climb down the arm to the main body and keep climbing upwards. It sounded easy enough. Soon, I had climbed a few hundred feet off the ground. The blood from the cut on my arm touched one of the arms that made up the bigger one and it moved. The rest were shifting, making it impossible to keep a grip on it. My hands slipped and my body fell back down to the ground. The arm tried to reform to catch me before I died only so it could bring me to an even worse fate.  

I landed on something soft. Feathers drifted up as I moved at a crazy speed through the air. Rolling on my stomach, I got a better look at what just saved my life. 

I was on the back of a huge seagull that flew around, dodging the arms that were reaching for us. I knew its face and the sandy spots of brown along the feathers, even if we hadn't seen each other in such a long time. 

“Hey stranger, need a lift?” The seagull spoke, letting out a cackling laugh. 

I didn’t know she could talk. I buried my face in her feathers for a moment, overwhelmed at how thankful I felt towards her. She directed us to the ground, but I didn’t want that. 

“I need to get my partner. My plan is to go in through that opening up there!” I shouted over the wind. 

She kept flying around, obviously not liking the plan and she showed it. I took a risk trying to convince her. 

“Gully, please.” I begged, hoping the nickname helped. 

It sure did, as her eyes lit up after hearing it. With another great cackling she took off like a jet. I wrapped my arms around her neck for dear life so tightly, it was a miracle I didn’t choke her. We crashed into the large wing near the slightly shifting opening. I rolled off her back, trying to recover. Her body shifted as she also rolled into something much smaller that slammed into me. 

We both sat up, looking at each other. Her body very much more like a human instead of a bird. Her legs were still clawed, and feathers hid under a dress. The front barely covered her chest and strapped in the back showing off her tanned and spotted skin. Light feathers instead of hair stood up from the tumble. Goddamn, she was cute. But now was not the time to notice that. 

“You better come back out and get me some more onion rings buddy. You and your partner have been the only people not to call me an oversized sky rat. That’s just offensive to rats.” Laughing again, she helped me stand up. 

“I’ll give you as many onion rings as you want and some blooming onions.” I told her, meaning it. 

She looked confused on what a blooming onion was. It would be very entertaining to watch her try one after this was all over. I got ready to jump right in, but she made me stop. Pulling out a huge feather longer than my arms from thin air, she handed it over. 

“Use this like a sword. It's pretty sharp so don’t hurt yourself. It’ll dull after a while though. Anyway, I gotta go help out some others, later taters.” She walked over to the edge and fell backwards.  

Her seagull form then came into view and circled once, then dove back down out of sight. I needed to admit to myself that I had it bad for supernatural girls. Shaking the thought from my head, I looked down into the darkness, trying to see the faint red light I’d spotted before.  

I could only trust my idea would work. Carefully slipping down, I found my footing against more of that still long line of arms connecting the wings together on the inside. The place shook as the monster moved, making it very hard to keep my balance. It almost looked as if the monster went on forever. 

The further down I moved, the more I looked for any signs of Nick or the other agents that’d been taken. By sheer luck, I saw a spot between the wings open enough to let an arm inside, a limp form in its grasp. I watched it as it went further in, and near to one of the outer walls. With a lot of difficulty, I made my way over to the spot. A long mass of arms meshed together liked tree roots blocked my path. When the creature moved, the line of arms shifted. I timed it so I could squeeze through before it closed and crushed my chest. Inside the enclosed space were more walls made up those arms. 

Some agents were held onto that wall, most of their body covered by hands. Each person asleep and appearing drained. I checked the pulse of one to find it very weak. I wanted to cut them loose, but worried if I harmed the arms holding them, I would alert the stone of an intruder. Somehow, it found out anyway. An arm sprang up, slashing my shoulder. I ran back, trying to defend myself. Soon, more joined it forcing me to make a run for it. The feather sliced through some of the ones that got too close. I moved blindly to anywhere I could get some footing. 

I quickly became outnumbered. The arms landed more minor wounds on my body. Unlike the agents, I didn’t heal. A color I knew very wall flashed in the corner of my eye. Slashing down arms, I saw Nick in the distance. Now I had a goal. I pushed through, cutting and slicing and no longer worried all that much about my own body. By the time I reached him, both my upper arms were covered in long cuts and my hands were covered in my own blood. 

I cut at the hands holding him back in between cutting away the ones attacking behind me. My feather gradually got duller like Gully had warned. I just needed a little bit more time. The last hand held him around his throat. I worried I might cut him by accident, so I pulled on that hand, getting some of my blood on his cheek. So many of those arms shot out, wrapping themselves around my body to pull me back. I screamed, still holding the arm that kept Nick pinned. It came loose as I was pulled away. His limp body fell towards the ground. 

I screamed again when hands reached up to catch him. I hadn’t come this far not to save him. The arms dragged me back, and I pushed myself forward with all the strength I had. Something else moved around Nick. A form came from the floor, a pair of arms holding him upright from behind. A person without legs appeared, their upper half pressed against his back and face near his ear. Nick’s eyes didn’t open but my stomach dropped as his hair started to change. It started to glow at the tips as he started to shift in his stone state. This wasn’t good. I couldn’t let the imperfect stone use him. 

Struggling forward I reached out to them, shouting for the other person to let go of my partner. Then I heard what the stone was asking of him. 

“I want to die.” 

I yelled, begging the stone to take it back. To not make Nick be the one to do such a thing. It simply wasn’t fair. With so many hands holding me back, I still managed to get a mere fingertip away from them. I begged the stone to ask to be changed instead. Any cost it would take, I would give it up. It met my eyes, a sad smile on the cracked and pained face. It appreciated the request. But didn’t want to burden me with such a cost. It was already too late either way. 

A red light started to come on the cracks in its face. I finally grabbed a hold of the imperfect stone’s hand, and dropped the feather to take Nick’s. The red light overtaking everything else. The arms and wings disappeared and everything else crumbled away in that light. 

When I woke up next, I was on a cot beside Nick, still asleep inside a tent set up to treat any injured agents. As far as I could see, the outcome didn’t look too bad. Most of it looked like a lot of people sleeping. My wounds treated and somewhat healed with whatever medicine on hand. My movement attracted attention. 

Large footsteps came and I barely had enough energy to turn my head. Ancaer stood, his expression as grumpy as ever. I really didn't know what to expect from him. He held out his hand and I did the same to accept whatever he was offering. He placed a small rough-cut ruby in my palm. It felt far too cold.  

I clutched it tight, knowing who the ruby was. 

“Do not let anyone see that beside your partner. I do not know who leaked the information about Nicolas to The Hunters. We are looking into this matter to ensure this never happens again. Also, you’re stupid.” 

His blunt insult made me snicker after such an emotionally draining case. Turning on his heel, he left to deal with more important issues. When Nick woke up, I would give him the ruby knowing it would be best if he kept it. 

We didn’t see each other for a couple of days after everything happened. At home one night, while still healing up from my minor cuts and ready to go to sleep, I heard a knocking at my door. I hurried over, hoping it was Nick. He normally slept a lot, and felt very weak after using his weird power. Opening the door, I saw he appeared fine. He held a file folder in his hands, but he didn’t mention a case. 

“May I come in for a personal request?” He asked. 

He didn’t even need to ask. I let him inside so he could sit at my kitchen table. The file folder lay in front of him as I stood. He sat sideways on his chair to speak. 

“Are you feeling alright?” I asked him, not sure how to start talking about what happened. 

“I’m fine. Not as tired as other cases. Aberash is doing a few tests just to be certain. I... came to understand how close I was to death and reflected on that.” 

We’d both nearly died pretty often. I really didn't know why this time was what got him thinking. Opening the folder, he pushed the papers in my direction and placed a pen on top.  

“If... You're comfortable with it, please read through these forms. You may sign them, or not. After I realized I was without any family to pass on my assets, I made a will. You'll be the one to inherit most of the funds, along with the mansion.” 

“Nickie...” I choked out from shock. 

I never wanted to think about losing him. Getting his money and his crazy house would almost be too much. I would rather struggle with money for my entire life than be without him and get rich. He shook his head, wanting to go on. The papers weren’t a will. I didn’t know if I needed to sign something like that. With his hands neatly folded in his lap, his tone became more embarrassed. 

“These forms are not required for you to inherit. And they hold no legal standing on the human side of things. Supernatural families have a tradition of growing their power by accepting others into them. It’s a little bit complicated, but it’s normal for them to adopt uncles or cousins. This would only be recognized by The Corporation, but what I'm asking is...” 

He paused, the tips of his ears turning a slight red. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Bowing his head to hide the rest of his red face, I saw just how colored his ears got by the question he wanted to ask. 

“Please let me formally call you my brother.” 

After he spoke, it became so silent I could hear him breathing. I didn’t notice it, but I was holding my own breath. I slowly let it out and my body acted without me even knowing. Ugly tears flowed over my cheeks and when Nick looked back up, he panicked over the sight. I smothered him in a hug, not letting him stand up or escape it. With his arms tightly around my waist, he let me cry myself out. Even after I was done, I didn’t let go of him. 

I wanted to sign those papers right away. When I tried to move to do so, I realized I was locked in place. Nick didn’t release his grip. At first, I thought he might still be a bit emotional. 

“You went inside another creature’s mouth.” He pointed out, sounding disappointed. 

“In my defense, you went in there first.” 

That was not the reply I should have said. I struggled trying to get away as he kept one arm around my chest and stripped his suit jacket off. Nick was pretty strong when he had a goal. In a flash, both my arms were inside his jacket, and he tied the sleeves behind my back like a strait jacket. I sat, wriggling attempting to get free. If he’d gotten his hands on enough bubble wrap, he would have cocooned me in it. I needed to promise him ten times I wouldn’t keep walking into monster’s mouths while on cases, and he even produced an extra paper to sign.  When he knew I spoke honestly, he untied the sleeves so I could start reading and signing. 

I've considered him my brother for a very long time. This made it official. Handing back all he forms he needed to file, I left to grab the cold ruby. He took it, treating it like the precious thing it really was. We both regretted the fact the stone would rather die. It wasn’t created by the same person who made Nick, but he would have considered it a sibling.  

Since he pretty much escaped from Aberash to come over, he needed to head back. I handed over his jacket, now knowing that if I acted up on a case, he could easily put me in my place.  

“With these forms submitted, there may be a decrease in the rumors about us. It appears a great deal of our co-workers do not understand other forms of love and assume romantic interest is the only thing out there.” 

I was grossed out thinking people thought Nick and I were a couple. Couldn’t anyone just like each other in a platonic way anymore? Tucking the folder under his arm, he realized what he just admitted. For the first time he used such a heavy word. A hint of the red came back to the tips of his ears. 

“If anyone gives you a hard time about us, just look at them and say, ‘that's my brother you're talking about’.” I said with a laugh. 

He nodded, color overtaking his face again. It was still too soon for him to talk like that. It would take a while longer for him to even be able to use the word brother in front of others when it came to us. After everything he’d been through, I didn’t blame him. But that didn’t stop me from embarrassing the hell out of him. I mean, that’s what little brothers did after all. 

“Hey, Snickerdoodle, you know I love you, right?” 

He nearly dropped his papers. Flustered, he quickly said he needed to head back to the office, hurrying away and trying to hide his face. I was totally going to pull a stunt like that again. Nickie was no longer safe, and he got himself in this mess. I just needed to wait for the right chance for attack. 

Later that night, he got me back. I found it hard to sleep, my still healing cuts itchy. As I looked up at my dark ceiling, a light came on as my phone started to ring on the bedside table. Being so late, it could only be work. I picked it up, not bothering to check the number. 

“I love you too. Please stop trying to get eaten.” 

The phone clicked as the call ended; Nick had hung up without giving me a chance to respond. My face turned as red as his did and I needed to press my hands against it. If nearly getting eaten led to him being this nice, I needed to find some big hungry monsters to tempt fate at least once one more time.

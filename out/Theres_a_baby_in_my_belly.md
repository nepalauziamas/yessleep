* There’s a girl in my driveway
* With a dress covered in blood
* Little branches in her pigtails
* And her shoes are soaked in mud
* 

* There’s a girl in my driveway
* And she’s standing in the rain
* Though her eyes show no emotion
* It’s apparent she’s in pain
* 

* There’s a girl in my driveway
* And my wife now sees her too
* She tells me to let her in
* Wouldn't have done it if I knew
* 

* There’s a girl in my house
* And I don’t know where she’s from
* I have leftovers from dinner
* And decide to offer some
* 

* There’s a girl in my house
* And she doesn’t look at me
* She keeps staring right behind me 
* As the blood streams down her knees
* 

* There’s a girl in my house
* And she passes me a note
* I reach out to her to take it
* And to look at what she wrote
* 

* “There’s a baby in my belly
* That is what the doctors say
* As I heard my mommy crying
* I wished it would go away
* 

* There’s a baby in my belly
* I begged mommy to believe
* that I did not make this baby
* but dad tells her she’s naïve 
* 

* There’s a baby in my belly
* But I’m only just fourteen
* They say I might have been molested
* But I don’t know what that means
* 

* There’s a baby in my belly
* It is growing big and strong
* They say it’s been here for three months
* But something tells me they are wrong
* 


* There’s a baby in my belly
* It makes me crave the strangest things 
* Suddenly I want to feast on
* Squirrels, cats and pigeon wings
* 


* There’s a baby in my belly
* Without food it will not rest
* And although it liked my hamster
* It likes human meat the best
* 

* There’s a baby in my belly 
* And its hunger never stops
* Yesterday I bit my brother
* And now I can’t get enough
* 

* There’s a baby in my belly
* It’s grown far too strong for me
* It started kicking at my stomach
* It is trying to break free
* 

* There’s a baby in my belly
* And it keeps me up at night
* It’s not as much motherhood
* As its screams that bring me fright
* 


* There’s a baby in my belly 
* And I don’t know what to do
* It started eating its way out
* And it’s almost halfway through
* 

* There was a baby in my belly 
* And it’s gonna kill my dad
* I don’t know what father did
* But it says that he’s been bad
* 

* There was a baby in my belly
* And its hunger didn’t end
* It kept eating at my loved ones
* And I know just where it went
* 
* There was a baby in my belly
* As I heard my daddy’s pleas
* I think I found out the hard way
* That revenge is never sweet
* 

* There was a baby in my belly
* And he brought me here to you
* He ate my father and my brother
* And now he’s coming for you too
* 

* There was a baby in my belly
* But don’t worry about your wife
* It is men that it is after 
* Cause they’ve hurt me all my life”

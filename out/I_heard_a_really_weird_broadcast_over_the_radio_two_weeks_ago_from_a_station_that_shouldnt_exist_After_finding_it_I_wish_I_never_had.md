Okay, to begin; you need to know that I liked to spend time outside at nighttime listening to the radio. Never usually anything specific, just whatever happens to be on. To answer your question as to why; well, I guess it’s just something I had always found comforting. Whether it’s going for a drive in my car (to nowhere really in particular), or just sitting on my back deck, staring at the night sky; I’d usually have *some* kind of FM radio playing in the background.

Looking back, I’d have to say the habit started back when I was about six or seven and my dad would always sit in the backyard in front of a small fire he’d built, listening to the radio, usually to the news or country. He said it was “a way of feelin’ connected from a distance.” He’d sit for hours at a time, too; sometimes not coming back inside till sunrise. A few times, I’d try to join him by the fire, but would inevitably get bored and just go back inside and watch cartoons.

Funny enough though, as I got older, I would end up picking up the same habit. Like father, like son, I guess. In high school, me and my buddies would often go on nighttime drives down roads neither of us knew — even getting lost quite a few times — just blasting the radio on a station that played Metal music.

Like I said, I never really grew out of this habit. And when my old man passed away in my senior year, I inherited his old radio. From then to the present, I spent hours once the sun set just sitting in the backyard, listening to different stations, just like he used to. It was the same that night, a couple weeks ago, just surfing through different stations until I finally settled on 96.7 FM; a rock music station.

For a while, everything was going just fine. Just me, the music, and the quiet night until, in the middle of “Dream On”, the radio started fading out to static. It was just a small change at first; basically just a light static buzz with the music fading a little in its volume. Then, though, I noticed the static essentially swallow the other sounds from the radio until it was nothing but white noise.

*”What the hell?”*

I started trying to tap it to try and maybe knock the signal back. When that didn’t seem to work, I started fooling with the antenna, thinking maybe it needed to be readjusted (figuring I must’ve knocked it out of range without noticing). This wasn’t working either.

\*”Great”, I thought, annoyed, turning the knob to another station. *”HAD to be during one of my favorite songs, too.”* The next station came through. From the sound of it, it was one of those mainstream hip-hop stations I couldn’t stand, so I flipped again to one of a comedy show.

I decided I’d listen to this for a while before finally heading in for the night and off to bed (I *DID* have to work in the morning). Well, just like 96.7, everything was fine until I started hearing the static again. Just like before, it ended up dominating the rest of the sounds coming from the radio.

*”What’s going on with this thing”*, I wondered, tapping it on the sides again. I tried tuning to all of the other different stations; all of them being drowned in clouds of interference. I even bent the antenna about five different ways (almost breaking the damn thing in frustration), trying to get a clear signal. Nothing. Every station; static.

All except for one, that is. That one I said was a “hip-hop” station. That was the *only* one that seemed to actually come in clearly. Well, sort of.

Maybe I should specify. I *said* it was a hip-hop music station, but that’s not entirely accurate. It was more of a mixed droning noise with synthesized sounds passing through at certain points. Honestly, I didn’t think that, in of itself, was *that* weird — again, just figuring it was some new, quote-unquote, “trendy” type of music kids were into these days.

That is, until I heard something else coming from the radio as well. Listening closer, I could hear some sort of garbled voice blended amid the droning. It sounded mechanical, sounding like someone was speaking with one of those artificial voice boxes.

Because of this, I couldn’t tell you a word of what was being said. I did notice, though, the sound of different letters, like it was *trying* to form words; maybe in a different language or something. With this, I figured maybe it was a foreign broadcast, a station from another country maybe (though, I wonder how they’d manage to broadcast all the way out here, deep in the south, you know?).

In any case, I tried one more time to switch the stations before saying “screw it” and heading back in for the night. Figuring *whatever that was*, was just a one-time deal, a freak occurrence, and I’d be able to listen to the radio like normal again tomorrow, right? Well, that idea died when I went outside the next morning, realizing I’d left it out there by accident (and apparently still turned on), and found that it was still playing that weird station.

The first thing to go through my mind, of course, was how was it still playing. The batteries should’ve given out long before then, given how much I use it and it’d been at least a couple months since the last time I actually changed them. Then, there was still the question of what this station even was. What was it even playing (like I said, it wasn’t exactly what I’d call “music”), and what was it saying, or TRYING to say?

I tried to flip the stations again. Nothing. Static fuzz all around. Finally, realizing I had to head out for work, I took out the batteries and set the radio on the counter, deciding I’d replace them when I got home. *”That’ll fix it”*, I thought.

At work, one of my coworkers, Porter, had his radio playing “Sirius XM” while we worked, repairing the transmission in an SUV someone brought in. I wondered if maybe he’d heard it as well; that weird ass station. When I asked him, though, it was obvious he didn’t have a clue what the hell I was talking about. “All I listen to is this”, he said, pointing to his radio.

“Oh, well last night, I was outside listening to my radio when this weird station started playing and all the other stations weren’t comin’ through anymore.” He asked me what kind of music it was playing, to which I described, as best I could, what it was like. I asked him, being a lot more into modern music trends than I was (as well as an aspiring musician, constantly showing off his EDM tracks on SoundCloud), if he knew what kind of music it was and if maybe he knew what station(s) might play it.

Still, it was obvious he didn’t know. He told me that it *sort of* sounded like some kind of “LoFi” or “synth wave station”. Of course, I had to ask him what the hell *that* was (yeah, yeah, I’m out of touch, I know). He then pulled up YouTube and showed me something called “24/7 Synth wave radio”.

Admittedly, listening to it for a moment, it *DID* sound similar to what I was hearing the previous night. Though, it still didn’t quite match. The music I was hearing from Porter’s phone was clear and obviously just music; unlike what I’d heard from the radio which sounded more like this being put through a blender on its highest setting with a bunch of nails before then mixing it with a droning noise.

Not to mention, that still didn’t answer the other question; what station was the one playing it and why (and how) were all the other stations not working? I gave this no further thought, though, given that it was clear that Porter didn’t seem to know and, like I said earlier, I figured a change of batteries would solve the problem anyway. What did it matter what station it was or how it was playing, right?

On the way home, I was driving to the Walgreens to grab some batteries, blasting my music as usual, when I started hearing it start to fade into a static cloud. It was a small change at first, just like with the radio in the backyard. Because of this, I didn’t really notice at first. Plus, it was cloudy out, so I figured that was probably screwing with the signal.

Of course, soon, the music was lost completely to the static. I started flipping around the stations but, you guessed it; all of them were gone, nothing but a cloud of interference. *”Damn, is the weather really THAT bad? Come on, there’s gotta be ONE station that—“*

I stopped when I started hearing something from the radio. It sounded like some Retro-synth music, similar to what I heard from Porter’s phone, though again, not nearly as polished or clean with its sound. This confused me at first. *”The car, too?”*

I looked at the radio to see the station labeled as “66.69 FUTR FM”. At least, that’s what it *looked* like it was reading. That was something else that confused me, seeing that the digits were sort of jumbled; looking half-completed. You know, the way you’d see in old digital clocks that were getting worn out (even though my car’s model is actually only one from last year)?

Well anyway, having the same problem I was with the radio; not being able to play any other stations except for this one, I decided to just cut the radio off and pick up the batteries. Admittedly, a small part of me *did* wonder if it was even worth it to bother with new radio batteries, given that apparently whatever this broadcast was, *wasn’t* just isolated to it. After picking up the batteries, I headed home where, after changing the batteries, I turned the radio on and started station surfing. As I’d hoped, they all played normally.

*”So then, what the hell WAS that station”*, I wondered. That led me to try Google searching for “66.69 FUTR FM”. This turned out to lead to a dead-end, though. Next, I tried searching for “Synth wave radio stations”, which led to a few results; each of them with a few recorded tracks, as well as some live recordings of their broadcasts through YouTube.

I clicked on them, but realized none of them matched. None of them were what I was hearing through the radios. At least, not by themselves. See, that’s when I realized that the strange music from the radios was actually a weird sort of blend of every one of these stations, with a low-pitch droning as a sort of foundation or background noise for it.

That night, I’d go through my typical nighttime ritual of listening to the radio in the backyard (now with fresh batteries). This time, though, I was waiting, ready, hoping to catch the broadcast again. I thought maybe a further listen might shed a bit of light on what exactly it was and maybe even where it was from.

Just like the night before, everything was normal for a while. Hours started ticking by, with the night getting later and later, and still, nothing seemed to be happening with the radio. *”Come on”*, I thought impatiently. It was getting to be about 2:30 to three in the morning and I was about to give it up, figuring maybe it really WAS just a fluke after all, when it started happening again.

I was listening to a late night talk show when I heard it start fading in and out of the signal. And, just as I’d hoped, all other stations went down with it. I turned until hitting the only station that wasn’t static, “66.69 FUTR FM”, before leaning in close to try and listen.

At first, it just seemed to play the same constant droning synth loop I’d heard before. Then, I finally heard the weird distorted voice from before. It sounded as garbled and damn near incomprehensible as last time. This time, concentrating as hard as I possibly could, even holding the damn thing straight up to my ear (which left them ringing afterwards), I could hear the deep-toned robo-voice start listing what sounded like numbers and a mix of letters.

To the best I can remember, here’s what I heard:

***”1000 edgrsee noligtedu, Aset alidutet 35... sWet alidutet 64”***

Then I heard this following:

**”Nac Uoy reAh me... Mi ratpeped ni etweneb drowls... tis onicmg to teg me... egt me tou of rehe...”**

After that, it went back to the synth music. I sat listening for a little while longer, hoping to maybe catch it, the weird voice, speaking again. Unfortunately, though, I just couldn’t hold out long enough and I ended up falling asleep before I’d hear another message, if there was one.

This morning, I woke up in my yard chair to find the radio still playing the synth music. I heard it play for about another three to five minutes before it seemed to get swallowed by interference. After this, I turned to find the other stations working again like they were supposed to. After mentally kicking myself for falling asleep while trying to listen, I tried to think again about what I’d heard (or rather, *thought* I’d heard.

What was that? What the hell was he saying? Hell, WHO was it that was even speaking to begin with? *”Where in God’s name was it coming from?”*

It was just a few hours later that day, though, that I heard the broadcast again. This time, I was able to use my phone to record the parts of the voice speaking. I noticed, too, that it seemed louder than before. It sounded more emphasized as well, like whoever it was that was speaking was shouting in the microphone, like they were scared almost. At first, It was more or less the same message as last night.

***”1000 edgrsee noligtedu, Aset alidutet 35... swet alidutet 64... Nac Uoy reAh me... Mi ratpeped ni etweneb drowls... egt me tou of erah...”***

Then, about fifteen minutes later, I heard this being shouted;

***”TEG ME THE UCFK TOU OF RHEE! I NODT NAWT TO EB RHEE! IT RUTHS! REVETYHNIG RUTHS! TIS RUTHNIG ME! LEAPS TEG ME TOU!”***

This was when I realized that the messages seemed to actually repeat. For about another two hours or so, it cycled in a constant loop; starting with the first one, with the shouting one following it half an hour or so later. Of course, being as disjointed and jumbled as it was, I couldn’t make heads or tails out of a damn bit of that.

I called my old buddy, Reggie, over to try and see if maybe *he* can tell me anything about it. He worked at a TV station, so I figured, if *ANYONE* might have a clue, he might. After listening to it, though, Reggie said he’d never seen or heard of anything like this before. I asked him if he knew of any other stations that played the weird synth music, but he knew nothing about that either. “The only places I know that plays anything like that would be YouTube or maybe Spotify”, he told me.

When I asked him about the messages; what was being said, he replied that he, too, couldn’t make much of it, either. He told me that he could try looking into it later on that night. I asked if he’d be able to bunk over, maybe bring his equipment over to my place, and we’d be able to look into it together.

He declined, though. “I have to work tomorrow. Plus, I’d need to take this into the studio anyway for proper examination.” He had a point, so I decided to let him take it home with him, asking him to listen to it and let me know if something new comes up. He agreed before leaving, taking the radio with him.

I didn’t hear from him again until two days later. In that time, I hadn’t heard the broadcast again — something, though, I attribute to the fact that I hadn’t actually been listening to the radio (not even in the car, not having gone anywhere). When he did get back to me, over the phone, it was to more or less tell me he came up empty handed as far as where the broadcast was actually coming from.

He did, however, apparently manage to clean up a bit of the warped speech and tell me what was being said. That’s when things would begin taking a sharp turn left. This is the translation he sent me:

***”Can you hear me? I’m trapped in between worlds! It’s hurting me! Get me out of here!”***

Needless to say, I found this extremely unnerving. Who was this? Where were they, and what were they talking about?

*”Why did he seem so hysterical? What does he mean by “trapped in between worlds?”* I asked Reggie if he was absolutely sure *that* was what was actually being said through the broadcast. He replied by sending me a recorded fragment of the broadcast, followed by an audio translation. Listening to the both of them side-by-side, sure as hell, he was right. That really *was* what was being said.

He told me this was likely a pirated signal, despite the fact that he still didn’t know why he couldn’t pin the source. “Even pirate signals come from somewhere”, he told me, “But, for whatever reason, this one seems to be coming from nowhere.”

“How”, I asked.

“Beats the hell out of me. Like I’ve been saying, I’ve never heard anything at all like this before.”

“Does the voice sound at all familiar? Maybe if we found a match for —“

“Not likely”, he interrupted, laughing sarcastically. “The voice is too distorted. It was honestly everything I could do to put the words together the way I did. Hell, the only reason I was able to do *that* much was because I recognized bits and pieces of the words and found a way to isolate them from the background noise.”

“Oh”, I said, defeated. “Well, was there anything else? Weren’t there numbers also?”

“Yeah, I think so actually, hold on.” I could hear him shuffle papers around. “Ah, Here we go. Got a piece of paper and a pen handy?”

He then went on to tell me the coordinates for 1,000 degrees longitude, 35 degrees east latitude, and 64 degrees west. After that, I thanked him before hanging up. For a while, I sat, thinking, wondering what was going on. What was this, this message; the station, the voice, all of it, what actually *was* it? What did any of it mean?

Not only that, but why was *I* the one hearing it? I know that’s a bit of a dramatic question to ask, but still. Why was I the one that kept catching the broadcasts, given that no one else seemed to even know what the hell I was talking about?

*”What was he afraid of?”* That’s when I started wondering what he meant by “It’s after me”. *What* was after him? Where did it come from? “Between worlds”, maybe; but then still, what did THAT mean?

The biggest question, though, is what would happen if I decided to investigate further? Admittedly, I was quite intimidated by now. The bizarre nature of it all, coupled with the mysterious, and quite ominous message was really starting to get to me by that point.

Disturbed or not, though, it was clear to me I wasn’t gonna get any piece of mind from this until I got some answers. The problem then was how. How was I supposed to find the meaning behind messages from a radio station that, by rights, basically doesn’t exist? Where would I go to even start?

Well, for that, I decided to look into the coordinates Reggie gave me. Using Google Earth, I managed to pinpoint a location that actually wasn’t *too* far away from me. It was a spot about thirty miles outside my town; about two and a half to three hours away from where I lived.

Thing is, at least from what I’d been led most of my life to believe, there wasn’t anything out in that area for at least another ten or so miles past that point. And according to Google maps, this was indeed the case; that whole area being essentially barren. *”So then, what the hell was out there, and how was it there if it wasn’t showing up on the map?”*

I tried multiple times to zoom in on the area. Each time resulted with the same conclusion, though; there was nothing there. I then texted Reggie, asking if he'd be willing to look into it. About twenty minutes went by before he responded with the same answer. I asked him if he was sure, if it weren't possible that *somebody* was sending out a pirate signal.

**--- "Not likely. Trust me, unless I'm mistaken, in order to hijack main airways like this, they'd need SOME sort of studio setup. Some kind of place of operations with at least some basic radio equipment."**

With that, I was stumped once again. With no leads, no clues, no evidence, and frankly, no real will to keep pushing at the matter, I decided to shut everything down and call it a night. That is, until late that night when, as I was about to go to sleep, my phone started ringing off the hook with a call from Reggie. "H-hell-" I was cut off before I could even finish.

"Dude, something's going on!" He shouted this excitedly into the phone. 

"Huh? What do you mean?"

"Those coordinates, you know how there was nothing there earlier?"

"Yeah, why?"

"Look at them now." I booted the computer back up and pulled up Google Earth again, inputting the coordinates. Sure enough, zooming in close, there it was; a small run-down looking sort of shack with a satellite on the roof. "You see it?"

I didn't answer at first. I was speechless. I had to rub my eyes and even slap myself to make sure I was *actually* awake and seeing this. Finally, I managed to stammer out, "Y-Yeah... but... but *how*?!"

"I know, right", he shouted, obviously geeking out about this. "It just showed up like, a minute ago, when the station started playing again on the radio! When I looked again on Google Earth, and there it was!"

"Wait, what do you mean "it just appeared?"

"Exactly what I said, man. Just a minute ago, it wasn't there; but as soon as the station starts playin' on the radio, abraca-fuckin'-dabra; there is is!" He cackled like he was Dr. Frankenstein. I wasn't as ecstatic about this. 

Instead, I was just *lost*. If I wasn't looking right at it myself in that moment, I'd have told him that he needed to quit smoking whatever he was on. Of course, that didn't at all explain *how* this was even possible. In fact, this obviously created a whole new generation of questions, ones that I wasn't certain I had any real means to answer. *"Hell, at this point, do I even REALLY want to know?"*

That was the other thing; I still couldn't shake the feeling that *whatever* this was, wasn't something I had any business screwing around with. I mean, when it came to things like this; things that shouldn't be possible like this (especially in this situation where everything was just so ominous), it typically *wasn't* a good idea to go tumbling down the rabbit hole, right? At the same time, though, I just couldn't seem to let it go. I just *had* to know, danger or not.

“Hold up, what the hell?” I was instantly brought back from my thoughts into reality. “Where is it?!”

“What? What happened?” Ironically enough, as soon as I asked, I actually saw it myself. The station wasn’t on the screen anymore. *“How in the hell?”*

On the other end, I could hear the frantic clacking of his keyboard, followed by the slamming of his fist on the desk and him shouting, “Shit! It’s gone! The station’s disappeared!”

“Calm down, what happened? What do you mean by “disappeared?” 

“Exactly what I said, dude. It just fuckin’ vanished! You see it?” 

“Yeah, I’m looking at it. What happened; Where’d it go?”

“Hell if I’d know! I mean, you saw it, too, right; it *was* just there, wasn’t it?”

“Yeah, I saw that. But where is it now?”

“I don’t know. One moment it’s there while the radio was playing; and now it’s—“

“Wait a minute, say that again.”

“What? That it was just there a minute ago?”

“No, the other part. About the radio.”

“What about it?”

Gears were starting to turn in my brain now. “Didn’t you say that you saw it appear when the radio started playing the broadcast again?”

“Yeah, why?” 

“How about now, is it still playing?” For a second, it was silent before he replied that it wasn’t. “Reg, I hate to sound like a nerd, like you, here, but you don’t suppose the broadcast may’ve had something to do with the station being there, do you?”

“Holy shit”, he replied, realization flooding into his voice. “Dude, how did I not think of that? Yeah, I think you’re right.”

“What about the broadcast? Did it change at all, maybe say anything different?”

“No, not that I’m aware of. Just the same shit from before. Why? What’re you planning to do here?”

I thought for a moment before finally settling on a decision. “Tomorrow afternoon”, I declared, “You and me, we’ll meet up out there and see it for ourselves. Finally put this whole damn thing to bed.” Though I said this with confidence, the truth was, I wasn’t feeling confident much at all. Either way though, I was ready to be done with all of this and I’d said it now, so no sense in trying to back out. 

12:00 the next afternoon, I made the trek out to the area, arriving at about 2:45, with Reggie arriving about an hour later. Once there, we just sat and waited for nightfall. That day went by slowly, seeming like night wasn’t gonna come at all; and, by extension, neither would the broadcast. Eventually, though, the sun went down and just a few hours later, the radio started going through its motions of fuzzing up every station with static until only the one, “66.69 FUTR FM”, was functional.

Just as I’d hoped, too (at least back then), the broadcast started playing and we saw the station begin to appear. I remember how me and Reggie looked when we saw this. We were astonished. We were amazed. We were *horrified* even — or at least *I* was! 

“Sweet mother of frickin’ God”, I heard him whisper, his mouth still hanging slack. The station continued to fade into existence right in front of us while the music from the radio actually got louder and louder. Finally, it fully materialized and the sounds were now near deafening. That’s when we heard the message again, this time booming. 

I was about to switch it off when Reggie stopped me. “If we stop it now, it might disappear again.” He then waved over toward the building, “Come on, let’s see what’s inside.”

I stepped forward *very* slowly. I could feel my legs shaking with every step. Behind me, I could hear from the radio, ***”TEG ME THE UCFK TOU OF RHEE! I NODT NAWT TO EB RHEE! IT RUTHS! REVETYHNIG RUTHS! TIS RUTHNIG ME! LEAPS TEG ME TOU!”***

*”What the hell is he saying?!”*

I met Reggie at the front door. I could tell, despite his excited demeanor before, he, too, was feeling anxious from the was he slowly, shakily reached out to grab the door knob. Neither of us knew what would happen, if anything at all. Honestly, I was almost half-expecting his hand would pass right through it, like it was a hologram or something. 

Instead, he grasped the knob tight and began jiggling it. It seemed to take a bit of effort before it finally creaked open inward. Inside was completely dark, somehow even standing out in the pitch black of the night, as well as dead silent. I took out my phone and began trying to use the flash light on my camera to look around; to no use. My light might as well have been a small lit match trying to light up the inside of a cave. “H-hello”, I called into the darkness. 

Nothing replied from within. Reggie tried calling out. That, too, resulted in silence.  Reggie made his way inside. Almost instantly, his body was swallowed by the darkness within. “Reggie”, I called out, reaching out to him, “Reggie!”

I retracted my hand, however, when I felt something wet push back against it. *”Huh? What the?”* I reached out again to the opening. That’s when I noticed it wasn’t actually an open space in the doorway. Whatever it was felt like I was touching a gel mold; wet and flexible, malleable. *”What is this stuff”*, I wondered, now beyond disbelief. *”Hell, what even is this PLACE?!”*

“Reggie”, I called out again. There was no answer. I stepped closer and cupped my hands around my mouth and shouted “Reggie, you there?!” Still, nothing. 

I was actually about to try going in after him when I noticed something shifting with the radio, causing me to stop and look back to it. The speech started to jumble; another voice seeming to integrate with the original. The background droning noise also began distorting, fluctuating back and forth between high and low pitches. 

The new voice began to overpower the old one and it started to grow distant. Then, I watched the gelatinous mass in the doorway in front of me begin wriggling, undulating and pulsing violently. The new voice was now loudly repeating the message while the old one was now faded away completely. That’s when something big was hurled out of the dark doorway straight into me, knocking me over. 

Picking myself up, I watched as what looked like a haggard, raggedy looking man was scrambling to his feet. He was tall and looked like he’d been starved to near death, with a long, unkempt beard and hair that was hanging past his shoulders. His clothes looked old and worn out, even seeing more than a few holes in various places. “I’m out”, he said, breathing heavily. “He did it! Holy, sweet Jesus, I’m free! I’m finally free!”

“Who the hell are you”, I shouted, alarmed. “Who are you, and where’s Reggie?!” He looked at me, smiling joyfully. His eyes were wide, like an animal, with red veins spread all across them, looking like tiny tree roots. 

“He set me free”, he whispered eagerly.

“What? What do you mean? Free from what?” 

He pointed to the station, “From there.” I looked over to the opening again. It was calm again, dark and empty. “I’ve been stuck in there for years! But I’m out now! I’m finally out, finally *free!*” He started cackling again.

“What happened in there”, I asked, snapping his attention back to me. 

“Years back, I heard the message from the radio and I found this place! I went inside and *it* took me and forced me to keep playin’ the broadcast. It let the other one go, the one before me.” He cackled like a lunatic before adding, “Now, I’ve finally been let go and *he’s* taken my place! I’m FREE!”

“Who did?” He looked at me for a second, puzzled. “Who’s “it”? Why was it forcing you to keep playing the broadcast?” 

His face drained of color almost immediately, his look of glee falling into one of cold terror. He pointed to the station again, “It don’t got a name. It’s pure evil. It likes to see us suffer. That’s why it makes us keep playin’ the broadcast, see?” He stopped, shuddering, his body quivering almost as violently as the gelatin mass in the doorway a few seconds ago. 

“It’s all just a sick game. It wants us to keep cryin’ out for help. It likes it, and we can’t stop, or else no one else’ll come. We’d be trapped forever!” 

“Trapped where”, I asked, my own eyes growing wide as a sharp chill pricked its way down my back. He pointed toward the station again. I looked again into the dark mass in the doorway. *”Reggie’s in there!”*

“In there, between our world and its. It’s from another world, you see? It’s here to pull in new prey, constantly rotating, torturing new victims in a never ending cycle by twistin’ and pullin’ em apart to force them to cry out for help through the broadcast.” I started to to go for the doorway. “What’re you doin’?”

“My friend’s in there, I have to get him out!” 

“Wait”, he shouted, grabbing my arm.  “You can’t! If you go in there, you’ll be trapped!”

“Well I can’t just sit here and noth-“ I stopped when I heard the radio starting to fade into static. The broadcast was ending, and sure enough, the station was fading along with it. I jerked my arm free and sprinted, hurling myself into the doorway. It was when I landed facedown into concrete, however, that I realized I was too late. The station was too far faded, gone back to whatever world or dimension it came from.

“REGGIE”, I cried, ***“REGGIE!”***

“He’s gone. He’s trapped in between, with it.”

I shot up and immediately rushed the man, snatching him by his worn out shirt collar. “How do I get him back?!” I was seeing red. I had half a mind to throw him to the ground and stomp him down, right there in the dirt. “HOW DO I MAKE HIM COME BACK?!”

“Y-you can’t”, he stammered, frightened. “You have to wait till he broadcasts the signal again!”.

“WHEN?!”

He shrugged, “I don’t know, honest! It depends on how long it makes him suffer before he breaks and tries to cry for help!” I looked over to the now empty space and released him. He scurried away like a mouse in the direction closest to the town. I stayed behind.

That brings me to now. I haven’t heard the broadcast or seen the station appear again, but I know it will. And when it does, I know I’ll hear Reggie, crying out for mercy in that distorted voice just like the man was. I don’t want to do it, but I know I have to; I have to go in and free him. 

That’s why I’m writing this, as a warning. What this thing is, I don’t know, and I’m afraid for when I have to find out. At the same time, it’s *my* fault Reggie’s trapped, and I can’t just go on while he’s trapped there, “in between worlds”. 

So, I’m begging you now, don’t come looking for me, please! If you hear the broadcast or find the radio station “66.69 FUTR FM”; for the love of god, IGNORE IT! God knows I wish I did now...

I remember the night it happened so vividly like the memory is a stain on my mind. It was the night that every child in Ridgewood disappeared and there was nothing left behind.

Most people were already settled in or getting ready for bed. Each hour passed by uneventfully as always, but around midnight, something unexpected happened. Every child up to the age of fifteen completely vanished and it went unnoticed for far too long.

Nobody claimed to see anything. Not one person claimed to have seen the children leave, or someone taking them. Although, there were well over five-hundred kids in the entire city of Ridgewood, so that would be awfully hard to pull off alone and you can't trust everyone's word.

I was called to investigate the strange occurrence. Luckily, I don't have any children of my own and some say that prevents me from becoming too invested in the case, but I say that's a lie. My job is finding missing people, that means ALL people and if I wasn't good at it, or if I didn't like my job, then I wouldn't do it.

So, suck it, Jack from homicide.

The town came together and petitioned for a team to be assembled, but funding and other budget issues left the problem down to me. I know what you're thinking, "That's ridiculous!" And you're right; it is. However, Ridgewood isn't known for making the best decisions collectively so it's to be expected.

I started as any normal investigator would, by asking each individual parent about their experience. Most had the same answer; they were sleeping and woke up to find their child (or children) gone. There were some, though, that mentioned feeling hazy and others even recalled SEEING their children walking out of their homes. Apparently they were powerless to do anything about it.

After all my asking around, I really only came to one conclusion. The children went somewhere, on their own accord. The next question was where? And furthermore, why?

I decided to search for clues in the grass surrounding some of the victims' homes. As you might expect, there wasn't much to go on. I scoured front yards, backyards and all manner of places, but to no avail. Unfortunately, many of the people had pets and their pets all but ruined any semblance of evidence.

All except one place.

A small trailer on the outskirts of Ridgewood near Grim Valley (the industrial district.) Grim Valley also just so happens to be where my office is. The trailer bordered the tree line for Argyle Woods and was home to a rather troubled family. They got by, but not without their fair share of problems. Still, that's all besides the point - their son was missing just the same.

The only difference being, there WAS a path leading from the trailer towards the woods. I asked the parents about the ominous dragging pattern in the grass and they said it wasn't there prior to the night of the disappearance. That gave me enough to go on, but it also left me wondering as to why the initial police response hadn't noticed it. Probably because they didn't care enough, and that's just plain sad.

Still, I followed the matted down streak of grass. It showed a certain feet scuffing motion that was indicative of someone dragging their feet. The trail led towards Argyle Woods and for a moment, I lost it. Upon entering the forest, most of my visibility had gone and I was back where I started.

A scrap of clothing would put me back on the case and it further pointed towards the incompetence of the local police force. I traipsed through the forest careful not to disturb any potential evidence. The trail led me down a winding path that grew increasingly worn as if it had been walked on for years, or by numerous people in a short amount of time.

I went deeper and deeper; it soon hit me that I had completely separated myself from civilization, if something were to happen to me, no one would know. I kept wondering about if the same thing that befell the children would befall me, and what that thing exactly was. I hoped to find the answer when I reached the end of the trail, long as it was.

The trees started to thin and give way to a sort of clearing. There was still no sign of the children, but I had a strange feeling in my bones that told me I was nearing answers.

As I entered the clearing, that feeling became one of malevolence. A heaviness fell on my shoulders like someone turned up the gravity and the sky seemed to darken around me. The clearing was empty (save for a large but twisted Oak tree) but it looked like it had only recently been made. Several other mangled, bramble-like trees grew around the clearing - each created a wall of mangled vines and branches that appeared difficult to pass through.

I instinctively reached for my gun - a Ruger Redhawk .44 Remington Magnum. A pricey piece, but well worth the fiery kick it creates. I held it at the ready and surveyed the clearing; it felt suspiciously quiet - like one of those horror movie cliches.

And in much of the same vein, an ominous figure emerged from behind the Oak and presented themselves. I brought up my gun and issued a command, "Freeze! Don't move…"

I couldn't see their face because they wore a hood and the rest of their clothing was in a robed fashion. They also held their hands together in the center of their chest as if they were praying, but I couldn't hear if they were saying anything. I took a few steps forward and commanded again, "Turn around and put your hands above your head!"

Surprisingly, they complied. Slowly they turned around and raised their arms high in the air. I approached them calmly and asked, "What are you doing here? Do you know where the children are?"

"You have come far, haven't you Detective?" They asked with a sneering tone.

"You know who I am? You better start answering pal!"

They snickered and said, "I am their guardian…"

"Guardian, what? Who's guardian exactly? The children's?"

"No, sweet, naive Detective. I am a guardian for the trees."

"Okay buddy, you're coming with me." I said because I wasn't buying a single word of it.

"Their wrath will be realized - the culling; it has commenced."

"What are you even saying?" As I got closer to him, I withdrew a pair of handcuffs.

"Soon you will see. This whole town will see."

"Yeah, yeah. You can tell me all about it from a cell. Come on!" I exclaimed as I cuffed him. He didn't resist me, in fact, he even brought his hands down to the small of his back. I was surprised.

I gripped his shoulder lightly before beginning to usher him out of the forest. The trees creaked and groaned like they were talking amongst themselves and I heard the man chuckle. "Quiet." I said softly.

The man turned his head towards a particularly brittle looking birch tree and said, "I will return - you best make the preparations."

"I said be quiet!" I shoved him forward and he nearly stumbled. Usually, I wouldn't be so rough, but hundreds of children were missing and if he was the reason? Then me pushing him was the least of his worries.

Just as we were leaving the clearing, the birch tree he spoke too swayed and shook despite there not being a breeze. "Strange," I thought.

I guided the man out of the woods and onto the street. He hadn't said a word since he spoke to that tree and it was probably better that way. I brought him to my car and he entered of his own volition. On the drive to the station, I tried to get a good look at him through the rearview mirror, but he kept his head turned away from me.

Upon arriving at the station, several other officers greeted me with puzzled looks. I explained what had happened and immediate intrigue filled the entire building. I, along with my superior, walked to the interrogation room and sat the man down. My superior, Captain Leeman, removed the man's hood and revealed a series of deep trenches carved into his face.

We both left the room, "You said you found him out in Argyle?" Captain Leeman asked.

"Yeah, I tracked a trail behind one of the victims' homes; it led me to a clearing in the woods and he was there."

"That's it? You found him and nothing else?"

"No, I found this as well." I produced the scrap of clothing I discovered along the way, "Furthermore, the trees around the clearing were odd, like they didn't belong there and he wouldn't stop talking about them."

The captain took the scrap and studied it, "I have to admit… this is more than anything else we've found so far. What's this about the trees?"

"He said he was some sort of 'guardian' and that the culling had commenced. He sounds crazy, but he seems stable. He never lashed out at me and he obeyed every order given without fighting back."

"Hmm…" Muttered Captain Leeman, "Well, we better question him. Have you read him his rights?"

"Shit. No, I haven't, but I also didn't ask him anything about the disappearances."

"Good, good. Alright, let's go in and see what this bastard knows."

We walked into the interrogation room and I took a chair opposite of the man. Captain Leeman took a more aggressive approach and pulled a chair up next to him. The man smiled with a mouth filled with wicked and rotten teeth.

"Is something amusing?" I asked sternly.

"Oh yes." Said the man before smiling wider.

The captain mirandized the man, "You have the right to remain silent, anything you say or do can and WILL be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney, if you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights as I've read them to you?"

He turned to face the captain and batted his eyelashes like a lustful cartoon character before nodding slowly. "Wonderful, now, tell us what you were doing out in those woods."

"What woods?" Asked the man.

"I'm not playing games with you."

"You haven't even asked me my name! How informal of you both."

"Well, enlighten us, would you?" I interjected.

"I have no name." He said as he swung his head to face me again.

"Great, so now you're playing games with us? This is SERIOUS!" Shouted Leeman.

"I'm simply… biding my time."

"What does that mean?" I asked curiously.

"The children were only the beginning."

Captain Leeman slammed his fist against the table, "Bullshit! Tell us what you know right now scumbag!"

I hadn't seen the captain so infuriated since the cult case at the old steel mill; it was quite the spectacle. The man with no name laughed carelessly as if he had no concern for his own fate. Then, in a voice filled with pure malice, he said, "Four hundred and thirty-seven years ago, when Ridgewood was first established, the colonists of that time made a deal…"

I scoffed, "A deal? You've lost your goddamn mind. What does any of this have to do with the children?"

"It has EVERYTHING to do with the children."

"Spill it, before your cuffs get tighter." Said Leeman.

"I do not care about discomfort and what I tell you now, I divulge willingly. Without my cooperation, you have nothing to go on, so I'd advise you to treat me like a human being."

"You? Like a human? What about all those children? Innocent kids stolen from their loving families!"

I interjected, "Just keep going."

The man rolled his eyes and grinned; it was clear he got a kick out of working up the captain. "Anyway, way back then, a small council was convened. Their discussion? What to do about the trees."

"I don't see where this is going."

"Well, if you'd let me fucking FINISH! Maybe you would learn a thing or two."

"Watch your tone with me, young man." Said Leeman sternly.

"Whatever. You see, the trees owned this land; they reaped what nature had sowed and always had until our ancestors came. When the colonists started clearing the forest, the trees grew angry and began lashing out. Several colonists were swallowed by a wave of roots and some were snapped in half. At the rate it was going, there wouldn't be enough colonists to build the town. So, the council came to a consensus."

I looked at the captain or raised his eyebrow at me, I shrugged subtly and urged the man to continue, "They made a deal with the trees. Their terms? The trees had the right to reap the souls of any set number of children equal to or less than the amount of trees that had been cut down."

"And what were this council's terms?"

The man stared directly into my eyes, "That they wouldn't do it for at least one hundred years."

"You really expect us to believe any of this?" Asked the captain.

"You don't have to believe it. Just ask the mayor for access to the history of Ridgewood. You'll see how much was kept secret and you'll even see the signed pact with the trees."

"Who are you to them? And why, if it was for at least one hundred years, did they wait until now?"

"Throughout the generations, a guardian has always been chosen. When I was young, I was spoken to by an unknown voice that entranced me. I wandered to the same clearing you found me in and conversed with the Grand Oak. As far as your second question is concerned; it was because they wanted more."

"More?"

"Souls."

"Okay, I'll bite. Why do they need these souls?" I asked inquisitively.

The man narrowed his eyes intensely, "They need them to feed… him."

"Him?"

"Amdusias, Hell's dissonant musician."

Leeman chuckled, "And what's he supposed to be, some sort of demon?"

The man turned to face him slowly, "Yes, and you shouldn't mock him so."

"I'm not afraid of things that aren't real, pal."

Suddenly, the lights flickered. It was quick and fleeting, but I could have sworn I heard a faint sound of a flute. "He's likely heard this entire conversation. He makes the trees bend to his will and he is feeding on the souls of every child in Ridgewood to fuel his infernal cacophony. You are all far too late…"

"Alright, stand up. We're bringing you to a cell. When you want to give us the real answers, let the turn-key know and we'll both be eager to learn the truth."

The man laughed before wheezing terribly, "Your ignorance will forever be your downfall, captain."

Leeman scoffed and pushed the man through the door, down the hall. I stayed in the interrogation room unsure of what to think. I'm often used to supernatural things as my office deals in cases of that nature, but the scale of this was far beyond my pay grade. If it were a demon, a king no less, how would I even go about dealing with it?

I had to learn more. Captain Leeman would likely think it was a waste of time, but he knew what I dealt with and I suspected he hoped I would have an answer.

After about ten minutes, the lights flickered again and Captain Leeman reentered the interrogation room. I was sitting with my feet kicked up on the table and he gave me a wicked side-eye. Obviously, I moved them down when he said, "What is this, leisure time?"

"Sorry sir." I said hurriedly, "I've had a gnarly ache in my calves lately and it just felt good to stretch them."

"Well, maybe you should go home and drink some milk; it sounds like you're lacking calcium."

"I'm lactose intolerant."

He shook his head, "I should've guessed." Then a silence followed that felt louder than a thunderstorm. Captain Leeman was staring up at the light and I was, for all intents and purposes, twiddling my thumbs.

Finally, he spoke up, "So, what do you think about all that?"

"All what? The demon stuff?"

"Yeah, that's your business, isn't it?"

"The supernatural, yeah. But I've never encountered a demon before…"

"Well, do you know anything about this… Amdusias?"

"Not anything you'd like to hear. Besides, you would probably think it was nonsense anyway."

"I wouldn't be so sure." He said with a curious look, "Humor me Cain. After that truck stop dilemma, I might believe anything. I just didn't want him to know that."

"I see. Well, all I can really say is that Amdusias is a Duke of Hell. He is a musician, but not of any sort of music we'd find pleasant. Most importantly, he can bend trees to his will."

"Do you think that's true?" Asked Leeman.

"I really don't know. I think I'm going to do what he suggested, as ridiculous as it sounds."

"What, the mayor?"

"Yeah, I haven't spoken with Grace in quite some time."

He leaned back in his chair, "Weren't you two…"

"That's in the past."

"Some people never forget."

"Trust me, it's nothing to worry about."

"Alright, well if you find anything, be sure to bring it back here right away and please… if what he says is true, try to find a way to stop it."

I nodded, "Will do, Captain."

"You're dismissed." He said sternly. I stood up, stretched and began walking out of the station to my car.

The drive to the mayor's office was nail biting. I had a bad rapport with the mayor - we used to be an item. A few long nights out on the case snuffed the wick of that romance like a candle in the wind. Now she resented me, even if what I was doing was for a good and noble cause.

As I entered the office, the receptionist asked about my business. I mentioned needing to speak with Grace (the mayor) and was told to wait because she was, "Very busy." I knew the receptionist as well, and sensed apprehension in her voice. Fifteen LONG minutes later, Grace emerged from her office and reluctantly beckoned me inside.

She huffed, "Make it quick Avery."

"Fine, I'm just looking for old city records. Perhaps something dating all the way back to when Ridgewood was established?"

"I fail to see how this helps in any regard. Aren't you supposed to be looking for the children?" She asked in a scrutinizing tone.

I sighed, "Listen Grace. Just… humor me, would ya? I'm following a lead and it would be really helpful if I could get access to those documents."

Grace paced the room before sitting in her desk chair. "What do you need exactly? I haven't got all day. There are numerous parents calling me constantly about this situation and I NEED something to tell them soon."

"Me and the boss just got done interrogating some no-name freak I found out in Argyle. He spun a rather outlandish tale about this city and said I'd find more answers here with you. Something about an old pact with some trees? I know it sounds crazy…"

She muttered under her breath, "The Grand Oak…"

"Been keeping secrets, eh Grace?"

"Hush, I have done no such thing! I simply kept the well-being of everyone here at the forefront of my priorities. Nobody needs to know about something that's just superstition."

"Well, what if it ISN'T just superstition?"

"What, you believe that old shit?"

"I'm not sure. All I can say is something really strange is going on. The clearing I found that man had a multitude of trees that appeared dramatically out of place. Take that as you will."

"Fine. Here, take this key; it leads to the old archives under the building. There's a lot of shit down there, especially dust and spiders, so I hope you find what you're looking for." Grace handed me a rusty key that looked like it might break upon using it.

I tipped my hat to her, "Thanks. Your contribution will not go unnoticed."

"Just get out of here Avery. Come back to me when you have something concrete."

I left without saying a word and proceeded to walk downstairs. The door to the archive was made of iron and had rust covering the keyhole; it had not been opened in a very long time. I forced the key inside and turned it slowly until I heard an audible click. The door creaked as it slid open and echoed throughout the archive halls.

My first few steps inside were arduous due to the clouds of dust filling my lungs. I had to take a break just to catch my breath. Once I got used to it, I was able to explore deeper. Most of the books and records were boring ordinance stuff; things you would find in any city's archive. I must have overturned a hundred or more different files and was coming up empty-handed.

Several of the light bulbs were burnt out, so I really didn't have that much light to work with. That created a lot of problems because being in a dense, dark and dirty archive made plenty of shapes look like things they weren't. I was also not entirely sure I disbelieved the man, especially when I continued to hear various instruments like there was some faint marching band approaching but never quite getting close enough.

I had just about given up when I finally found what I was looking for. Sitting in a deteriorated wooden case, was a worn, leather-bound tome. The binding was torn, nearly shredded and each page was laden with holes likely from silverfish. Still, I skimmed through the pages looking for anything to confirm, or more importantly, deny what the man had said.

As I read, most of the entries were about new buildings being established and record keeping. There was a brief excerpt about a trade that took place between Ridgewood and a traveling pelt company, but as I continued, I began to fully believe the man was simply insane.

That was, until the last three pages.

The moment I turned that fourth to last page, I beheld an interesting set of words that immediately caught my eye. They said;

"We, as the people of Ridgewood, have come to the consensus that something must be done about the trees."

This brought our worst fears to reality, but my curiosity wouldn't let me peel myself away from the entry. It continued on;

"Lorely Smith, Reginald Harrison, Charles Brindley and John Carol have all perished by the devious hands of Satan and he lurks within each one of those trees. We must act quickly if we are to prevent any further death. Therefore, it is with a heavy heart that we make a deal. Many are not in favor, but those of us who are aware of the true circumstances have already agreed. We will enter their clearing at dusk and offer our terms. God save us all."

I was reluctant to read further; it rattled me enough to imagine myself in their place. However, there was still one final entry which was likely the outcome of their deal.

"By everything that is holy, we are saved! Our good people will be protected for at least one hundred years. Unfortunately, it is a problem for our descendants now. But, we have already prepared a prayer that will be said by each person twice daily for the fate of our future generations. Never say the name, Amdusias, lest his wrath be realized before our time. We are sorry, please forgive us."

That settled it. The man wasn't lying about the pact, the only problem was if the rest of it was real. People make things up all the time, and I could completely see a group of colonists conversing with a clearing because they claimed it was possessed by Satan. That shit happened all the time.

So then why did I feel like something was watching me?

I tucked the old book under my arm and proceeded to leave. As I pulled the brim of my hat down to remain obscured, I saw a hulking figure standing in the doorway. It seemed to appear out of thin air because one moment it wasn't there and the next, it was. I froze in place and reeled back as the figure proceeded to walk towards me.

Shadowy wisps wafted off it like a steaming bowl of soup in the winter; it was truly menacing.

I ran deeper in the archive and could hear the sounds of things being toppled behind me. The figure said nothing as it chased me relentlessly. Thinking quickly, I reached for my gun and drew it, but the moment I turned to aim at the figure, it was gone.

Suddenly, Grace's voice entered the room, "Avery? What's all the racket down here?"

I emerged from behind a tall bookshelf, "Did you not see that thing?!"

"What thing?" she asked with an air of confusion.

"Something was down here with me, Grace. It chased me into this corner!"

"It's just me and you, Avery. Have you lost your mind?"

I looked around the room, and when I realized it really was just me and her, I relaxed, "No, sorry. I've just been pretty stressed lately."

"It's fine…" she began, "Did you find what you were looking for?"

"Yeah, it's right here." I said before handing her the book.

"Wow, this is older than the dust in my grandmother's basement."

"Sure is. Regardless, it has some strange things inside. Specifically, it has the exact excerpt I was looking for, the one in accordance with what the man at the station said."

Grace skimmed through the book, but ultimately stopped when her eyes met the same journal entry mine had. "Well, this is as strange as it gets."

"You're telling me."

"It's complete bullshit though, right?" she asked, hopefully.

"I wouldn't be so sure. Ever since I've been on the case, many unexplainable things have happened. More importantly, the instruments…"

"Instruments?" she asked, curiously while tilting her head.

"Amdusias, the demon supposedly responsible for all this. He's a musician. The conductor of hell's atrocious orchestra, but he can make trees bend to his will. Doesn't that sound oddly coincidental?"

"Trees, a demon and music? Avery, you realize how absolutely insane this all sounds?"

"Yes, I'm aware. Humor me a moment. Let's say this is true, what would you do to fix it? I mean, who would you even talk to? What do we do next?"

Grace stood silently while she contemplated my questions intently. I continued to stand guard, as nearly being overtaken by a shadow creature wasn't something I wanted to happen without my being prepared for it.

Finally, after a few minutes, she said, "I suppose I'd contact a church of some kind. But really, this CAN'T be what's going on! Just think about it–"

Suddenly, the already dim lights began to flicker and the faint sound of a trumpet resonated against the archive walls.

"You're telling me, THAT'S normal?" I asked, condemningly.

Grace gasped and proceeded to back towards the doorway, "Okay, okay, I admit that's a bit freaky, but demons?! I still find it hard to believe. Regardless, I'm going upstairs; it's freezing here."

"I suppose I don't need to state the obvious of freezing temperatures being a classic sign of paranormal activity, right?"

"Quiet, Avery. Come on, it's about time to leave too. You've got a priest to speak to anyway." said Grace with a sly grin.

"Yeah, sure." Was all I could as I followed her out of the archives. When I closed the door behind me, I could have sworn that a pair of beady, yellow eyes were staring at me from the other side of the room.

Grace ultimately forced me out of the mayoral building. I had the book and a new lead. The church, the only one in Ridgewood.

I hoped there was a priest in the house of God.

Upon arriving at the church, it started to rain. I rushed inside and was greeted immediately by the resident priest, "Hello! Looking for some one-on-one time with our Lord on this dreary day?"

"No, father, I'm actually curious about whether you know anything in accordance with demons. Specifically one named Amdusias?" The moment I uttered his name, the priest's eyes shot in every direction and his entire demeanor changed.

"It is unwise to speak such a name in this sacred place…"

"Oh, how could I forget? I apologize, father. However, it is a matter of grave import. It concerns the children."

I could see a visible change on his face from one of concern to one of apprehension, "I can't help you, but I think I know someone who can." The priest ran into some side room before emerging with a scrap of paper, "Here, call this number and say, 'Father Callahan' sent you. They'll understand. Oh, and detective?"

"Yes, father?"

"Be careful."

I nodded and walked back to my car. The moment the door to the church closed, I glanced at my car and saw someone sitting in the passenger seat. The rain made it difficult to see clearly, but I'm fairly certain they were dead. However, as soon as I opened the door, no one was there.

"More demon shit." I thought to myself.

I pulled out my phone and dialed the number. A woman with a kind voice picked up, "Thank you for calling, what is the nature of your business?"

"Um… Father Callahan from Ridgewood sent me. He told me to call you?"

"Oh, yes! One moment while I connect you to one of our field agents!"

"Okay…"

Less than fifteen seconds later, a new voice spoke on the line, "Hello, this is Abel, who am I speaking with?"

"My name is Avery Cain, I'm a detective from Ridgewood. Father Callahan told me to call you because you might be able to help our city with a… problem we're experiencing."

"Cain, huh? That's a strange coincidence. Anyway, what sort of problem are we talking about?"

"Over five hundred children have disappeared from our town. I recently discovered a clearing in the woods where a man claiming to be some kind of 'Guardian' was lurking. When I brought him in for interrogation, he told me that a demon named Amdusias was the culprit and that the, and I quote, 'Culling' had begun."

"Ridgewood, right?" he asked quickly.

"Yeah, that's right."

"Where should we meet you?"

"Who's we? So, you'll come?" I asked hopefully.

"Just give us a place."

"Meet by the edge of Argyle Park, I'll take you to the clearing."

"We will be there shortly." And then, he hung up.

I was a prison guard in New Mexico but I am currently a patient at a psychiatric hospital where I’m now monitored 24 hours a day. I’ve only been able to post this through an associate that I have been writing to for the last two month’s. My mail is checked but there are ways of getting around this. 

6 months ago murders involving a prison gang named ‘Diablo’s’ took place. A week after the event one of the gang members came to us, I’ll call him inmate 47. He had information about the incident and in exchange, he wanted a reduced sentence. I wasn’t involved in the conversations but this was arranged with the warden, subsequently 5 high ranking gang members were moved to separate prisons. 

Word started going around the prison that inmate 47 had traded information for his own benefit, a few attempts at his life followed. The decision was made to move 47 to a secluded part of the prison and I was given the nightly task to monitor him. 47 was a small lean man, shaved head with most of his body covered in various tattoos. He grew increasingly agitated and paranoid over the first few days he was there. I could even hear him scream at night which I thought was due to his violent past.

 A week had passed and as I checked on 47, he sat rocking in the far corner of his cell. With his eyes darting from side to side, the words “I’m sorry, please leave me alone” came muffled from his hand covered mouth. He then gazed at me and shakily said the word “Stitches” he then turned away. After studying him for a moment I continued my patrol, ahead the lights flickered. One by one the large panel lighting went off and on, like a wave coming towards me. It shrouded me in darkness for a second as I felt a stream of air push passed me. 

The darkness continued down the corridor, I then heard the scream of 47. I sprinted back to his cell, calling for backup as I ran. I reached the now open door, there I found 47’s mutilated body on the floor covered in blood. He wasn’t alone. A dark hooded figure stood over him, I called out for them to put their hands on their head and back away from the body. Their head slowly glanced round. What stared back at me was a scarred disfigured face, both it’s mouth and eyes stitched shut with frayed bloodstained string. It slowly walked my direction, arm stretched out in front, its blood soaked glove palm facing me. Then nothing.

I woke up in the infirmary the morning after, the image of that thing burned into each retina. I was told that I had passed out before backup came to my aid. Once I was discharged they suspended me following a formal investigation, In the weeks ahead I was tormented by what I had witnessed. I couldn’t tell anyone what happened, if I started, it’s hideous face would flash before my eyes as I blinked. I decided the only way it would stop was to end it all. One failed suicide later, I was put in here. 

I still see it whenever I am asked to talk about what happened in group therapy or counselling sessions. I think its trying to warn me not to say anything but I just want it all to be over.

I’m so sorry to burden you with this information, my written words have sealed my fate.

Just remember, tell no one.

You don’t want a visit from Stitches.

I noticed it for the first time last Wednesday morning when I was checking my reflection in the mirror. A thin red line, maybe two inches in length, ran down the center of my upper chest. The skin around it was red and irritated. It didn’t seem too concerning, since it was barely larger than a scratch, but I was certain that it hadn’t been there when I showered and turned in last night. Squinting at the mark, I decided that I must have just laid on something while I was asleep, and went about my day without giving it another thought.

The next morning, I was quickly reminded of it when I returned to the mirror. Although I couldn’t say for certain, the mark appeared slightly wider now, and a large portion of my chest looked as disturbed as if it had been sunburnt. I traced the cut with one finger and realized that it was almost perfectly vertical, slicing down in a straight, consistent line. There was a surgical look about it, a thought that sent a chill through me.

But what was I suggesting? Of course it was all coincidental. I was probably just laying on something with a sharp edge. I went back to my bedroom and examined the sheets, hoping to find some tiny spring poking through the worn cushion. The skies outside were clear, and sunlight was pouring in through my bedside window, but I still couldn’t manage to find anything embedded in the sheets. Frowning, I glanced down at my hands. My fingernails weren’t longer than usual, but it was possible that I could be inflicting this accidentally upon myself. I returned to the bathroom and trimmed them down to the quick, just to be safe.

Having decided that I found the cause, I went on with my day. As I ran errands, I felt a slight itching over the inflamed area of my skin. I did my best to ignore it, but I found myself picking at the scar throughout the day whenever I was bored. This only seemed to make the itching worse.

When I returned home that night, I measured the scar with the cleanest ruler I could find in the junk drawer. It was about three and a half inches long and a sixteenth of an inch wide. Returning to the drawer to put the ruler away, I saw a pair of decrepit mittens lying in the back corner. I pulled them out, saw that the finger portions were still intact, and decided with a sigh of resignation that being overkill couldn’t hurt. I pulled them on, tightened the straps so they wouldn’t accidentally come undone, and went to bed feeling entirely ridiculous.

The next morning, the mittens hadn’t come undone, but the scar measured an eighth of an inch wide. I checked the measurement again and again, staring at the perfectly straight, clean line in the mirror. I leaned in until my nose was almost touching the glass, then drew my breath in sharply. Due to the swelling of the skin around the area, it was difficult to see exact details around the scar, but from this short distance, I could just make out that the mark was not the result of a single wide line, but three thin ones, all running exactly in parallel.

“What the hell?” I breathed, and my breath fogged up the glass. What was this? 

I suppose I should mention that I share an apartment with a roommate, my college friend Mike, but he was out visiting family for a couple of weeks. He was a great guy, and I’d never found reason to distrust him, but if he was there now, I might have suspected him of coming into my room and cutting me with his pocket-knife. There was no way these marks were done naturally or by a sleeping hand: they were so perfect, so precise and careful. I wondered if Mike had come back early and was trying to play a practical joke on me, but he had never been one for that sort of thing, and besides, this was just messed-up.

It was then that I started to freak out. There is nothing worse than something with no explanation, as seemingly small as it might be. My mind was racing around uncontrollably: was there some kind of killer lurking around the apartment complex, leaving these marks to play with me? They were so close to my heart that I shuddered to think of them driving the blade deeper one of these nights. 

I had to know what was happening. I went out and bought a set of small security cameras, one to mount above my entranceway, and the other to put above the bedroom door, as well as a new deadbolt that I fastened to the hall door. The alarms were programmed to alert me if there was any unexpected motion within the room, but being caught defenseless with a hostile intruder wasn’t exactly an improvement from my point of view, so I grabbed a baseball bat from the depths of my closet and stashed it right below the bed. 

I shouldn’t have fallen asleep that night. I had expected that I wouldn’t have been able to, as I lay awake in a cold sweat, staring at the door for any sign of motion, but adrenaline surges can’t last forever, and I dozed off in the early morning. 

I started awake, bleary-eyed, at some hour when sunlight was beginning to travel under the blinds and illuminate my wardrobe. Bleary-eyed, I reached for my phone to check the time. *Ding*. The face-recognition I had set up refused to unlock it. 

Annoyed, I shook the phone a bit and held it at a different angle. *Ding*. “Come on,” I muttered. *Ding*.

“Shit.”  
I leapt out of bed, flung on the lights, and dashed into the bathroom, my heart racing a mile a minute. Giving my reflection a once-over, and finding my face devoid of any new scars, I sighed in relief and collapsed against the basin. I held up the phone again, cursing myself for being so superstitious, but it still refused to unlock.

I rose and stared at myself, tracing out every detail. The mark on my chest was the same, three identical lines dragged downwards like a recently-plowed field. I moved upward from there, examining every inch, past my jawline, up to my mouth, past the nose, all clear of any incisions.

Then I reached my eyes. There was something off about them. My gaze was drawn into itself, searching until the rest of my features blurred around it, until it was only those eyes. *Those eyes*. They were green, shimmering like the rancid film on pond-water.

I had brown eyes. Everyone in my immediate family had brown eyes. It was our running joke, our way to identify each other, so these *weren’t my eyes, I could see it now, see them now, a stranger staring at me from my own mirror, these green monstrosities that weren’t my fucking eyes -* and a slight incision above each, almost hidden from sight.

I lurched to the toilet and threw up, feeling my sockets burning, itching worse than my chest, trying to tear these foreign objects out of my system. *It wasn’t possible*, I told myself, *there’s no surgery to do this, to manage all the nerves that could be involved - but - these aren’t mine -* 

Where were mine?

I slammed shut the bathroom door, locked it, cleared the closet and bathtub, and then huddled in a corner with my phone. I typed in the password manually with shaking hands and swiped toward the camera feed. The app opened with an animation of swirling colors that felt far too long. I swiped to my personal account and was met with an error message, alerting me that there had been a network outage in my area and camera feeds had failed to upload to the cloud. That meant that I would have to check them manually, but I was caught in this frozen state of panic, staring at the bathroom door with a sense of foreboding. I resolved to wait until I knew that my neighbors would be up. It was already 6:32, so it couldn’t be long.

I couldn’t decide if it was worse to shut my - *these* \- eyes or continue looking through someone else’s body. I waited, feeling as if I were submerged in ice, until 7:30 arrived and I could hear the definite shuffling of my neighbors out in the hall. I moved slowly toward the door, pivoting my neck to look all around me, and opening it, stared fixedly up and down the hall. Nothing.

I found the camera in my bedroom and pulled it down, tapping the playback button several times before I managed to push it down. The screen remained black. I flipped it over and saw that the SD card had been removed, with a little ‘Nice Try!’ scrawled in pristine, tiny letters above the opening. I returned to the bathroom and vomited again.

Moments later, I was out the door, deciding that the possible awkwardness of rooming with Mike’s family was no longer an issue. They were only an hour away, but I couldn’t stop shaking as I drove there, swerving back and forth over the lines. I still can’t believe that I wasn’t pulled over for driving under the influence. 

When I got there, Mike greeted me in the doorway, but I pulled him outside and hissed frantically that the apartment wasn’t safe. I ranted about the scars and the eyes, sounding delusional even to myself, and so I really couldn’t blame him when he escorted me inside with a very concerned expression. He managed to excuse me from the prying eyes of his family and place me into the guest room he was using, giving me the bed and promising to grab a sleeping bag from the basement for himself. He wanted to bring me to the hospital, but I had calmed down slightly by then, and managed to convince him not to. The last thing I wanted was to be alone in a room around surgical equipment.

That day was terrible, fairly the worst I’ve ever had, but time flies when you dread the night. All too quickly, the shadows crawled across the wooden paneling of the guest room, and Mike drew his sleeping bag in the corner. We talked for a little bit, although I certainly wasn't offering any good conversation, and then, eventually, he fell silent.

I lay awake, feeling my legs weak with terror, wishing that I’d decided to bring the baseball bat with me. There was nothing for so long, an eternity spent staring out through those foul eyes, but something came in the end. 

A creak sounded from the door, a blur of motion slivered through the darkness, and I tried to sit upright, but found myself paralyzed, caught rigid as a cadaver. 

“You’re not supposed to be awake,” it said, and its voice was human, with a faint rustling underscoring every word, as if it were a chainsmoker. “I’m sorry. Do you know how unpleasant that is going to make this?”

It came closer, and I saw Mike’s eyes wide open in the corner, but he appeared as immobile as I was, and it paid no attention to him. There was a sudden flash of glaring yellow light and I saw the silhouette of a human standing above me, all of its features were hidden by the glare.

“I’m disappointed that you noticed,” it said, the rasping barely noticeable. “In myself, of course. I was trying to be so careful.”

A hand came down on my chest, grey and three-fingered, each coming to a sharp point like an elongated stinger where the fingernails should have been. I could see veins riding around the joints, popping out so far that they appeared almost external, like thin snakes wrapping around the flesh below.

“I don’t know how my bedside manner will be. I’ve never had to use it before.”

The hand put a tray on my lower chest, a heavy weight that I could feel only from a distance. There were two coolers on it with the labels of hospital organ transportation and a series of tools that I couldn’t identify. I felt as if my heart should have been exploding out of my chest, but it beat calmly in this sleep paralysis, as slow as if I were dreaming. 

“It’s nothing you did,” it said. “You just look like him. He was caught in a terrible accident, highway collision, fire, you know? Very little left of him afterwards. A shame. If there’d been more, she could have just rebuilt him out of that, and all of this wouldn’t be necessary.”

One of those fingernails reached toward the scars on my chest, bringing a grey arm with the discolored muscles exposed, except for a scattered few that were the color of living human flesh.

“Don’t worry. They weren’t hurt, and you won’t be either. I’ve brought replacements.”

The fingernail reached down and made a fourth incision in line with the other three. The hand retreated, then reached down with all three fingers forming a sort of claw and dug around in my chest. I felt nothing and I couldn’t look away. With a satisfied sigh, the hidden figure drew out an organ - *kidney*, some part of my mind helpfully suggested - and carefully dropped it into one of the coolers. The hand wiped itself across a towel carefully, then reached into the other cooler and drew out the replacement.

“Yours is a copy of his down to ninety-ninety point nine percent accuracy,” it explained. Its tone was almost cheerful. “She wants the recreation to be *very* accurate. This replacement is only ninety-six percent similar to his, but it will work fine for you, I promise. Open up!”

With a laugh, it carefully navigated back toward the small slit in my chest, like some demented claw machine, and worked the organ back inside, then drew a tool from the surgical tray and fiddled around for a while.

“Very sophisticated techniques, I assure you. When you have as much wealth as she does, there is access to technology far beyond what you could imagine. Technology, and experts in other arts.”

It shut off the light and leaned in closer. I saw my brown eyes staring from the darkness above.

“You may call me the Surrogate. Doctor and monster in one - quite impressive, isn’t it? Taking bits from all of you lookalikes and fitting them into myself. The only things I can’t replace are these hands, but he wore gloves all the time, so she won’t mind.” It started to hum under its breath. “She gets her lover back, I get freedom from the underworld. A fair trade if I’ve ever heard of one.”

“Now, I’m sorry,” it said, turning the light back on, “But there’s one more thing she needs from you. The shade of your skin matches his almost perfectly. This will take a while, I’m afraid.”

It reached down and brushed across the surface of my chest with those three barbed fingers.

“Wait a minute,” it hissed, pressing its palm down. “No, this won’t do. Only ninety-four percent similar. I must have crossed my notes up. Damn it - this means that she’ll be waiting.” The hand withdrew sharply. “She doesn’t like to be kept waiting.”

I heard the sounds of shuffling across the floorboards, then the bedroom door creaking shut, and found myself able to move again. My screams woke the entire household.

To whichever poor soul the Surrogate is destined to harvest the skin from tonight, I will offer you one piece of advice above all else; don’t try to stay awake.

Trust me, you do not want to be conscious during that.

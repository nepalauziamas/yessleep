At some point as you become an adult, you notice your parents aging. It’s not a gradual thing, it just hits you. One day your parents look like they always did, the next you suddenly see all their age on them at once.

This happened to me the day I came back to visit my parents after having been away for about six months. I walked into the living room to find a bunch of mom’s friends situated around the living room each holding a copy of The Glass Castle. She was sitting in a chair somewhat behind me as I came in, so I didn’t really see her until after she’d grabbed me and hugged me tight. Then she pulled back to get a look at me. And I got a look at her. 

It’s a bit of a shock when you see it. The wrinkles and the thinning hair and everything else. 

And I noticed something else on her face that I’d become blind to. These deep discolored tracks coming down from the inside corners of her eyes down the sides of her nose. Out of all the other women there, she was the only one who had them. 

Well, everyone ages differently. Whatever. 

But seeing those tracks triggered a memory I’d completely forgotten. In it I'm young, and I'm in a strange bed that isn't mine, and my mother is crying. And she's telling me they're happy tears, but I can tell she's been crying for a very long time. 

It took me a while to place this memory, but after some rumination I was able to. It was at the end of a nightmare. The worst nightmare I'd ever had.

More memories came to me after that. More puzzle pieces to fit into place to reveal this event in my young life. The memory of waking up in a hospital (that strange bed that wasn't mine), but no one telling me that that's where I was. Everyone playing it off light, like it wasn't a big deal. But my mother was crying. 

One dreadful night the details of the incident itself came to me piece by piece as I lay in my bed unable to sleep. I've been in a kind of mental cloud since I've begun to remember this. I feel my reality has come unhinged and I'm floating in this miasma of not knowing what is real and what isn't, even as I'm experiencing it. 

I've confessed this to some of my friends. Many theories abound from them. It was just a nightmare with coincidental irl connections (hopeful, but I doubt it). I've repressed past sexual abuse and morphed it into some kind of strange supernatural experience in order to deal with it (I really don't think so). But one of my friends--her eyes went wide and she kept saying "oh my God," and when finally she'd milked the drama of it enough (she's one of those people) she said "you've got to talk to my cousin. He told me something exactly like what you're describing". 

I looked him up on FB and messaged him. And how horrifying it was to compare notes with him. Maybe we had similar nightmares, but the details couldn’t possibly line up like they did. 

There was one detail that didn’t line up. In his experience, he escaped. But as I remember it, I did not. In fact, I came to realize that I went missing for several days afterwards. 

If I went missing, then there probably would be a record of that. So I googled. The year, my town, “Disappearance”. 

And I got hits. "Search continues for 6 year old girl who has been missing for five days." They didn't disclose my name, but it was too much of a coincidence not to be me. A girl went missing from her home in the night, and they found her in the woods six days later. She'd been taken to the hospital, where she appeared to be fine. No leads were ever found. No suspects, no arrests, no explanation but the dry turd that squeezes out of logical digestion of the mystery: I must have wandered out of my house in the night and gotten lost in the woods. 

So below I'm going to get down in words what I remember about that incident. I feel it’s important for me to do this, since maybe by writing down what I remember I'll be able to separate and sort my thoughts and experiences. And maybe you'll be able to help, if you've had the same experience as I have. 

If my experience triggers for you a similar upheaval of your mental state, I'm sorry. We can go through this together. 

This is something that would have happened december, 2004. I imagine your experience, if you had one, would probably also have happened around this time as well.

I was six years old, and Christmas was coming. One night I woke with the sensation of having been awoken by something, but not knowing what. I sat up and waited, and then I heard it. A heavy thumping somewhere in the house. 

At first I was terrified. Until I realized...Santa!

It did not occur to me at that time that it was not yet Christmas eve. 

So now, I knew the rules. I was supposed to be in bed. You better watch out, you better not cry. But the rule was that Santa won't come if you're not asleep. And since Santa had clearly already come...what was he gonna do? Pack my presents back up and give me the finger as he shoots back up the chimney? Pfft. Santa would forgive me because I had been extra, extra good that year. He'd laugh his jolly laugh and wag his finger at me. And then give me an extra special present that I could brag about in show and tell when school starts up again. Maybe a bell from his sleigh, or something even cooler!

I came to the stairs and I crept down a few steps and peered through the banister in the darkness and sure enough I saw the large red mass of him down there in the living room. He was facing away from me, towards our tree. In one hand he grasped his bulging sack, which he raised and lowered to the floor, making a thudding sound. He did nothing else. Just stood there and occasionally thudded his sack. Which I thought was odd, but then I was six, and a lot of adult behavior was odd to me.

I tiptoed down the stairs and when I reached the bottom I stood for a long while watching with excitement before daring to whisper: "Santa?"

The shape rose up. He stood up tall. Very tall. The top of his hat bent against the ceiling. He turned just to the side a bit to look out at me with one eye. 

I smiled. I tried to look cute, my hands behind my back. "hi santa!" I whispered. 

There was no reply from Santa. He turned away from me again, seemingly waiting for something. 

Worried he was mad at me and ignoring me, I said "I know I’m not supposed to be awake. I’m sorry. I'll just...go back to bed. OK?"

Santa turned back again. Of his face, between the whites of his beard and hat fluff, I could only see his eyes. They were black in the dark but the light caught them and shone tiny points.  

He spoke. It was a kind of wet grunt. Guttural and strained. There didn't seem to be any words in it. 

"Are you OK, Santa? Are you feeling OK?"

Santa grunted again, and then stood there, staring. 

Oooh, Santa is sick, I thought. He has a cold and a sore throat! He couldn't speak clearly. And in my sleep-addled 6-year-old brain I felt I knew exactly how to fix that. 

"Have some milk and cookies?"

He grunted what I interpreted to be an affirmation, and did nothing else. 

I looked away from him because something wasn't right about him. Something about his sickness made his eyes look strange, and I knew it wasn't right to stare. 

I went to the coffee table by the couch where the plate was with the M&M cookies and the milk. Carefully I grabbed the glass of milk, which was quite heavy for my little hand, and the plate I grabbed with the other. In my stomach I felt the beginnings of what might have been a stomach ache, but was probably dread. Nonetheless, I was committed. I was certain I could help him and make it all better. 

"Milk and cookies?" I said again. 

There was no reply from the thing. I felt sick and strange. I knew something was wrong, even terribly wrong, but at that age I couldn't put together the pieces and discover what it was. I did notice one detail, and I noted it: his eyes were strangely wide and perhaps a bit too far apart to be normal. 

Elves look like that, I told myself, remembering that Santa Claus is technically an elf. I told myself that and then I pushed it from my mind before I could truly examine the idea. I wanted so badly to believe everything was OK, so I allowed any explanation at all. 

"Have some," I said meekly, trying to keep a light cheer in my voice. I realize now I was trying to will him to be friendly with my own friendliness. "Your throat. It will help." 

Seeing it closer, I was faced with a barrage of details I tried to ignore. The pom on the top of his hat wasn't spherical, but instead there came from it drooping bits coming off down the back of it. The red coat wasn't a solid bright red. It was a dark red, not a christmas red. And inconsistent in its color. And somewhat slick in places, like wet fur. Overall the impression of the thing was undeniably Santa, but the details were all a little off in some way or another. 

Still, I approached with my offering. Slowly. 

A phlegmy sound came out of it, and it reached up its black-gloved hand towards me. Poor, poor Santa! He truly needed my help. And I would bring him the help and when he had a cookie and drank some milk, he would feel better, and his throat would be OK and he would talk to me and say nice things and smile and laugh. It was up to me to fix Santa. And after I would, all the strangeness would melt away. Certainly this is what would happen.

And so I continued forward. 

Finally I was standing before the towering thing, staring up at it. The gloved hand reached forward for the plate. 

The suit, I could see then, was ill-fitting. The frame beneath it was wirey, skinny, and the fabric hung on it strangely. Something dripped from out of the loose glove opening at the wrist and splatted to the floor with a series of plops. 

The glove grasped at the plate and pulled off a cookie by its edge, knocking another to the floor. It brought the cookie up before its eyes, but it did not eat. It looked down at me. 

I bent to the plate and mimed eating. I looked up and forced a smile. "Try it, Santa. It'll help you." I don't know why I thought that, that cookies help colds. I was six and it was so very long after my bedtime and my thinking was mushy with fear. But I knew it in that moment with absolute certainty. This was going to fix him and make him normal. 

It brought the cookie to its mouth area, and the strands of its wiry beard parted. Its mouth opened strangely, pulling apart just slightly in ways I didn't understand in the darkness. It took in the cookie and crunched upon it, but I could tell it was simply letting the crushed bits of it fall down its beard. It was pretending to eat.

Santa was sick. Very sick. He was having trouble eating. And unfortunately the cookie wasn't going to fix the problem. 

I had one offering left, and I prayed with all my little six-year-old heart it would be enough. "the milk, Santa. For your throat. That's the most important part. The milk." My small voice rambled, trailing off. The milk. I mimed the drinking of it and then held it up as high as I could. The weight of it made my wrist wobble, but I held.  

I could smell his sickness. I'd never smelled anything like that. 

It took from me the glass. The black glove had the wrong number of fingers. Way too many.

It tipped the glass to its face and the milk glugged out down its beard and over the coat and dripped down onto the floor, splattering onto my pajamas. 

"Oh!" I said in surprise, and I took a step back. 

It took a step forward. A heavy, thudding step. 

In the grip of fear I called to my mother, but only softly, as if I didn't want it to hear me and yet somehow expected her to be able to hear. 

It hadn't closed its mouth properly, and I could see some knuckled appendage poking out through solid black lips.

The glass slipped forgotten from its hand and crashed on the floor. 

There was in my head a blast of red panic. I wanted to scream but I simply could not function beyond standing. The thing bent down to me, and I couldn't move to run or even fall away from its grasp. 

"ERIN!" my mother screeched from somewhere behind me. It shook me out of my terror enough that I could fall to the floor. I looked up and saw her shape there in the bedroom doorway, but in the dark I couldn't see her face. 

"You get AWAY FROM HER! YOU GET OUT OF HERE!" Her voice ramped up to a blasting screech of absolute panic and rage. "GET OUT! GET OUT!"

I felt the tremors of the thing moving behind me and I felt suddenly its glove around my head and then over my mouth. The smell of it was overwhelming and my vision caved in from the edges irising closed around my mother as she charged forwards towards us and at that moment my memory ends.

***

I have no memory of the next six days. My memory resumes in that hospital bed with my mother crying. For a long while after that I received an inordinate amount of hard-squeezed hugs from my parents at random times. I'd catch them watching me. My mother often with tears in her eyes. Tears of joy, she would tell me. Because she just loved me so *so* much. My father would apologize to me at seemingly random times for no reason. I suspect because he happened to be out late drinking with friends that night, and wasn’t there to prevent what happened.

Recently I tried to discuss this with my mother. 

"How did you find out?" she asked, after a long, long silence. 

"Some memories of it came back, and I googled."

"You didn't remember afterwards, and we figured it was best just to leave it that way," she said. “We never found out where you went. We were just happy to have you back unharmed.”

And then she changed the subject, as if that was all there was to say about it. As I pressed further about the imposter Santa, the unlikelihood of a six year old surviving six days in the woods, etc, I unearthed from her excuse after excuse. I hadn’t been abducted, she maintained, I must have been sleepwalking and got outside and lost in the forest. She insisted that it was simply a nightmare, that we'd both had a similar nightmare in connection with what had happened, and that the Santa element of it was only a byproduct of it having been around Christmas time. As I pressed the issue, getting angrier and angrier at her denial, she shut down entirely and completely refused to answer me as if I wasn't there. I'd never seen her act like that. I stopped entirely when she started to cry silently, the tears flowing free without resistance down those well-worn tracks from the corners of her eyes. 

Dad was angry at me for bringing it up with her. We're all happy now, why mess with that and bring up old wounds? 

I don’t know, Dad. maybe you’re right. I’m sorry. 

So that's what I've got. A lot of questions, and no answers. But now as I write this there is another piece of the memory that comes to me:

It begins with comfortable cold. The crunching of the snow beneath my pajamas. Lying on my back breathing out wispy vapors into the air and staring up at my favorite star as it slides slowly away across the sky. Someone in the distance calls my name, and I in a lazy haze call quietly back to them. There are immediate but vague memories of things incredible and strange, but they evaporate off my consciousness the way dreams do. As I close my eyes again I'm left only with the soft cold of the snow beneath me, and the excitement of knowing that was was Christmas, and Santa would be coming soon.

No matter where you are in town there are two things always within sight. The local radio tower with it's garish white and red structure, and that tear in the sky that sometimes has a large yellow eye looking through it. Funny how nobody in town would acknowledge that one, like some secret I wasn't allowed to talk about or others will just mock me in to silence. 


The Radio though we all talked about. You just never knew what would be on it, especially during the special call-in program so I figured I'd share some with you. Sorry if the details are a bit off but it gets really hard to focus... after two.

**After 2**


**The One With The Closet**

"And the mouse ran down the clock. Welcome dear listeners, as always I'm your host  -shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh- and this is After Two, the show that helps you deal with nothing good before the first ray of light. Lets see who we have waiting on the line today."


*"Hello? Can you help me."*


"I would love to madam, can you please speak up for our listeners."


*"Can't. They might hear. I don't know what they'll do if they find me. Can you help?"*


"Um, sure? Who is this *they*? Are you in danger madam?"


*"I don't know. I was asleep but then I heard footsteps, not like someone sneaking around but loud and heavy. I got scared, I live alone, there hasn't been a man around since Arnold died last fall. I don't know who this is or what I should do."*


"Madam if you suspect an intruder it's best not to confront them. Please remain hidden and contact the sheriff department."


*"Ok, I'll hide in the closet like always but, I don't understand why they keep coming back!"*


"What do you mean? You've had intruders before?"


*"Yes! Before it was this young couple that broke in and started making out in my own bed. I thought it was just a dare or something so I hid then too and didn't call the police but it keeps happening. The couple repeated the brake-in a few times, then I think they brought a kid with them for some reason. Only once though, after I yelled at him for coming here I never saw him again. I think he told his family because the next brake-in was this rough looking teen that smelled of cigarettes. The hoodlum was walking around like he owned the place, I would have rung his ear out if Arnold was here to back me up. I'm pretty sure he stole three of the good spoons and.... oh no."*


"Madam, are you alright? I can hear voices!"


*"It's, it's a man. Late middle age I think and on the heavy side. He's arguing with his partner and, oh god Arnold where are you! I think he's angry there isn't much to steal. Oh god please don't check the closet, please don't check the closet, please, please, please. Help me, please he-"*


"Madam? Madam are you there? Please answer me. I can still hear a gruff voice on the other end listeners, Hello, HELLO!"


"Huh? Who's this?"


"Hello sir, you're on the air right now. Can I speak to the old lady please."


"What? Is this some prank call? How did you get this number. Do you know what time it is? It's just me and the wife in this house."


"What about the old lady that was hiding in the closet, the one you just found."


"... Look, I don't know who you are but there ain't nothin in this closet but clothes, and for some reason my phone. There was nothin there when my parents bought this house, there was nothin there when I was a kid and there is nothin in there now. Got that! Nothing! It ain't even the same closet from back then. I built this one myself you hear, THERE AIN'T NOTHIN IN HERE!"


"Listeners, looks like he hung up on me. We here at the station would like to remind you that should you encounter the living during the borderline hours between two and first light then it is advisable to keep yourself hidden, by any means. There is no telling what they're up to. Stay safe listeners, always stay safe."

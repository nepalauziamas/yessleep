Hi. I'm completely new to Reddit, but I felt like this was the best place to share what i've been experiencing.

So, to provide some context, i'm in year 9 (Australian high school, I think the American equivalent is a Freshman/Sophomore?) Anyways, i've been taking a Child Development class, and this term we've each been allowed to do a RealCareâ„¢ program, where you take home a baby that you have to take care of.

I, a person who loves babies, jumped at the opportunity to take one of these babies home. I was so excited to feel like a mother! As soon as the bell rang I raced to the classroom, eager to meet what I would soon be calling my 'child'.

I beamed with excitement as my teacher handed her to me. She began rattling off tips and tricks on how to use her, but to be honest I wasn't really listening, instead choosing to focus on the baby.

"... And make sure to support her head when you hold her, too!" She reminded, as I readjusted my arms to properly hold the baby. She handed me a small bag, full of supplies for the baby, which I happily took, thanking her.

I hastily walked to my mum's car, ignoring all the weird stares and the 'Did she have a baby?' comments. I greeted my mum and younger brother, and hopped into the car, placing the baby's bag in the back seat.

"How long do you have that.. thing for?" My mum asked, looking down at her with concern.

"Um.. about a week, I think? I have to return her next Monday." I replied, and she simply rolled her eyes.

"Can I kick it? Can I punch it? Oh, oh, can I throw it out the window, Kate?!" My little brother, Liam, was purposely annoying me. I tried to ignore him, and just stayed quiet for the rest of the car ride.

When we arrived home, I set the baby down on my bed, and propped her head up on a pillow. To be honest, i'd really forgotten she was there because she never made a noise for the rest of the afternoon, and I even waited a few hours after I was supposed to sleep, just to see if she would cry, but she never did.

I barely got any sleep that night, feeling like someone - or something was watching me. Though, my previous worries were put aside when she woke me up at about 4:30 am, crying loudly. 

First, I chimed my student ID to her chest, before trying to see if she would take her bottle. Then, when that didn't work, I tried changing her diaper, which also did nothing. I gave up, and just started trying to rock her, but still after 15 minutes she was still crying. I was honestly wondering if she was faulty, or malfunctioning, so I tried searching on the internet for answers, but nobody else had the same problem.

I sighed and contemplated 'Emergency Stopping' her, but decided against it, because I really needed this to ace this assignment to get a good grade. I stared into her blue eyes, which looked creepily human, unable to understand what was wrong... but it just cried harder. Well, less of a cry, and more of a painful shriek. So, I sat there, covering the speaker on her tummy, in order to not wake up my family. I was just about done with this thing-

But then, it just... stopped. So, I don't know what happened there. It was 4:57 am at that point, and given I had to get up at 6, I chose against sleeping again, since I would probably sleep through my alarm.

I set the baby back up on the pillow, making sure that everything was okay, that her head was supported, etc. After everything was in order, I finally let myself rest. I walked to my kitchen and started to boil the kettle when it started doing that annoying, piercing scream again. I ran to my bedroom, to find the baby - no, that thing - hanging upside down from my ceiling fan. Now, I will admit, this scared me. Like really horrified me.

You see, I wouldn't be as scared if it could've been my little brother, Liam, because he's always up to something, but I always lock my bedroom door (and my window) after leaving it. And there's no way Liam could've picked my lock in the 30 seconds that I left my room for. Nonetheless, I untied the baby from my fan, and headed to Liam's room, ignoring its loud cries.

I barged into Liam's room, to find him... sleeping peacefully? This only confused me even more. If it wasn't Liam, then who hung the fake baby to my fucking ceiling fan?

This was yesterday, and I ended up skipping school that day, because I was so shaken up from what happened with the baby. I just sat in my room, not taking my eyes off that thing, I even brought it to the bathroom with me, just to make sure it wouldn't do anything while I was gone.

Of course, it had a few fits where it wouldn't accept the or a diaper and wouldn't calm down for a while, but I was honestly used to that. But last night, I had a horrible dream about the baby where it grew claws and struck me across the face. And then I woke up this morning, screaming, with three open cuts on my face. Large ones, too.

I kinda panicked, and I guess I wasn't thinking clearly because I threw it down my basement stairs and locked the door. It's 10:34 am now, and I can hear it screaming and banging under my room, almost *begging* to be let out. But honestly, i'm scared of what'll happen if I do. 

So, what should I do?

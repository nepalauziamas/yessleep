I want to express my gratitude for the incredible amount of support I have received from all of you regarding my work. I had to take a bit of time off from writing up cases to take care of my own mental health, even though I had several posts planned for last week. I ran into one of the most personally difficult cases I've ever experienced last week and have been spending a lot of time on self care. I do think I am ready to share this client’s story, so I hope you all enjoy reading it. I would like to give you all a warning that this case involves graphic violence against a child.

The woman in question was a little older, probably in her sixties. She had clearly had some work done so she appeared much younger, although somewhat artificially. She had larger than life bright blonde hair and a full face of bright makeup. Overall, she looked immaculately dressed and clearly proud of her appearance. She offered a lively smile as we exchanged greetings.

“Go ahead and take a seat on the couch in there. You can drop your things down there also, ma’am,” I instructed as she entered my home.

“Thank you, dear,” she replied in a thick Southern accent as she strode past me on a pair of heels.

We both found our respective seats and I settled myself in for another evening of work. “Did you bring the cash I requested?”

“Yes, love,” she answered, reaching into her glimmering purse to reveal an envelope.

I procured the payment before stating, “thank you, ma’am. You may begin whenever you are ready.”

The woman only nodded in response at first, seemingly unsure of where to start. We sat in silence for a few moments before she began, “well, I’m a medium. A damn good one at that. For personal reasons, I have been taking some time off, taking care of myself, all that. Recently, though, I’ve been working with a family because they are worried about potential spirits in the house harming their new baby. I decided to take the case on because I have a soft spot for children. I worried for that sweet soul.”

“What was going on in that house?” I questioned, crossing my legs.

“It just seemed like your typical haunting,” the woman replied with a chuckle. “They’re a dime a dozen, really. The family heard knocking and other unexplained noises throughout the house, and objects seemed to move on their own. The baby’s books fell out of the shelf, its mobile turned rapidly on its own. What really convinced me, though, was when I left the baby’s room for just a moment and returned to find its crib had been dragged all the way to the window, now wide open.”

“Scary stuff,” I responded.

The woman bobbed her head from side to side, a half smile on her face. “I don’t get scared much anymore. The family, though… they were terrified. It took some convincing and a whole lot of soul searching for me, but I finally agreed to make contact with whatever spirit remained in their home. We scheduled to meet last night to do just that.”

I leaned in, gesturing for her to continue.

“Before I explain what happened, there are some things I should explain. Not only am I clairvoyant, meaning that I see things that other people just don’t pick up, but I can also channel spirits so the people I work with can speak directly to whatever spirits are giving them trouble. When I allow a spirit to speak through me, I enter a cataleptic state. Essentially, my body goes entirely rigid, sometimes in weird positions,” she explained, tensing her body as if she had a cramp in each of her muscles. She relaxed back to normal before adding, “this helps me maintain control of my body. It feels strange to have another spirit inhabit your vessel, so it gives me a little more power in the whole situation. Also, I always tape my sessions. This helps me to see details I may have missed.”

I nodded to express my understanding.

“Okay, with that out of the way, I can get into the meat and potatoes of the story,” the woman declared. “Last night, I showed up at their house at our scheduled time. It’s a beautiful old house, the kind that you’d expect to have a ghost or two. We set up a table in the baby’s room as the presence was clearly strongest there. I don’t want to bore you with all the details, so I’ll just get to it. Once I identified a presence, I asked it to reveal itself to me. Imagine my surprise when it was a stunning young woman, dressed in a beautiful gown.”

“Did she say anything to you?” I urged.

The woman nodded. “If I can’t get a spirit to tell me why it’s there, I won’t make much progress. I pressed her to reveal why she had not crossed yet to the other side. She explained that the house used to be a home for unwed mothers, something like a refuge for single pregnant women. They would house and care for these women and adopt out the babies afterwards.”

I was aware of the existence of homes such as these. “Why was that keeping her tied to that home?”

“Well, apparently the whole thing was a façade for something much more sinister,” the woman sighed. “There was never any adoption. Instead, the owner of the home would sell the newborns to truly sick individuals. They would do unmentionable harm to these babies, ultimately murdering them. The spirit explained that she could not leave until this tragedy was known, until people knew what happened to these poor little angels.”

I exhaled a long sigh.

The woman began to tear up at the thought. “The spirit asked if I’d like to know the fate of the poor babies, and I agreed. I invited her to inhabit my body so she could speak directly to the family. She remained on the opposite side of the room but raised her arms in my direction. Suddenly, her limbs elongated… reaching all the way across the room towards me. I felt her presence enter my physical being, and I became cataleptic.”

“What did she show you?” I inquired.

She immediately began to cry. “She didn’t *show* me anything. I blacked out completely. She ripped me out of my tensed state with strength I had never experienced before and took me for a joyride, essentially. When I came to, I was entirely covered in blood. The family laid slain all around me.” The woman sniffed loudly, dabbing her eyes on a tissue before adding, “well, all except for the baby.”

“Where was the baby?” I asked cautiously.

“I had no recollection of what had happened, so I went to the tapes. I watched in horror as I saw myself destroy the family, then moved slowly to the crib. Possessed by this spirit, I savagely ripped the infant apart, tearing its limbs off before opening its belly. Then, I stuffed its insides into my… my mouth,” she sobbed. “I ate the whole damn thing, ripping its flesh from its bones. I tore up a loose floorboard and discarded the remains there. The video ended, and I was absolutely disturbed. But I was able to verify that the bones of this baby, and the bones of others, were indeed underneath that floor in a sack. I realized then that I had invited the wretched owner of that forsaken home to enter my body. I had been tricked.”

“Ma’am, I’m so sorry,” I offered.

The woman shook her head as she cried, “I should have known not to take the case. I am obviously very susceptible to spirits already, but spirits are known to take advantage of those in a weakened state.” She reached up slowly to comb one hand through her hair, then removed the crown of yellow from her head entirely. She placed the wig in her lap as she explained, “I have cancer, and the treatments are extremely fatiguing. I was not strong enough to face a spirit. I should have known.”

I stared in silence.

“The worst part is, I finally have my first grandbaby. I love her more than I can even put into words,” she wailed. “When a particularly strong spirit such as this one takes command of your body, it’s not like it takes hold and releases you. No, it’s more like… fishing. She’s got her hook in me, and she will reel me back in when she desires. And I know she wants that baby.”

I nodded slowly. “Ma’am, please lie down. I’m going to prepare the injection.”

She did as I asked, and I returned with the needle as soon as I could steady my hands. “Do you have any last words or wishes?”

The woman gazed up at me, looking warmly into my eyes. “Yes, dear. A little birdie has been whispering in my ear the entire time I’ve been speaking with you. Would you like to hear?”

My jaw dropped. “B-birdie?” I stammered, immediately recognizing the unconventional name. “Yes, please. Yes.”

Her body tensed all at once. A long silence passed before she spoke. “Hi, darling. Miss me?”

The tears came quickly, flowing from my eyes. I instantly knew it was her, my late girlfriend. “Yes, of course I miss you. What the hell are you doing here?”

“Well, I always told you I couldn’t live without you,” she spoke through the woman, a slow half grin spreading across her face. “Turns out I can’t *not* live without you either, I guess.”

I let out a quick, sad laugh.

“I know you can’t see me, most people can’t. But when this woman saw me as she entered the room, I knew I had to take the chance to talk to you,” she explained. “I just need you to know that I am always with you, watching over you and protecting you. I stand beside you as you listen to these stories, and when you’re curled up on the floor crying after they’re gone and you think no one is watching, I’m right there on the ground with you.”

“That’s kind of embarrassing, but I’m glad I’m not alone,” I stated through tears.

“You know I can’t stand to see you with someone else, but I’m happy you have her. I’m not *here* anymore, even though I always am. You deserve to be happy.” She paused before adding, “I’m so proud of you for taking something so awful and making something absolutely beautiful out of it. I am so, so proud of you. I always knew you would do great things.”

I gazed down, clasping the woman’s hand.

Her hand squeezed mine. “I know this is going to be hard, but you have to let her go now.”

I shook my head hastily. “No, I can’t. I can’t do it. I don’t want to,” I cried.

“You have to, angel. She’s not safe, and she deserves peace. These are your rules,” she countered. “Plus, the crab walker has been slowly inching over to her ever since she got here. It’s close now, and it wants her.”

When the woman had passed and I fell to the floor crying, I felt a little less alone [this time](https://www.reddit.com/r/hercreation/).

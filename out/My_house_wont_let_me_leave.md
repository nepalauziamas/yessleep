A few weeks ago I moved into a new house in the countryside. This was a huge change from the previous city bungalo I lived in. I hate the city, but I didn’t have enough money to move so I waited until I had enough saved and after a few weeks of looking I found the perfect house far from the city. It had two stories and three bedrooms. It was situated in the middle of a forest 2 miles from the nearest town. This would help my work too as I didn’t have any distractions from the noise outside. Just the sound of nature.

I instantly adapted to the country lifestyle. It was a huge change from the beeping cars and streetlights shining in my window. Now I had peace, finally. My dog on the other hand didn’t adjust too well to the house, and for an unknown reason spent most of his day barking at the wall. This gave me reason to believe there were rats in the house so I went into town to buy some mouse-traps.

The second I put one foot inside the store I felt unwelcome. People were giving me dirty looks and once I picked up the mouse traps they avoided me altogether. When I reached the till, the guy serving me began to talk. “Sooooo, do you live in that old house outside town?” he said casually. I told him where I lived and he just stayed silent, nodding slowly as I spoke. “you know” he said “Ever’body that ever lived in there want mouse traps. I don't think anybody lived in that place for more than a year, from what I seen.” I paid for the mouse traps and hurried out of there.

Once I got home I cut up a few pieces of cheese, put them on the mouse traps and placed them in every room of the house. But after a few days of them being untouched I decided to give up on them. It was around then I started hearing the noises in the walls. But those noises were nothing compared to what happened soon after. 

Yesterday I was working on my computer in my study, when the door suddenly slammed shut. I assumed it was a draught so opened it again and got back to work. After another minute the door closed again so I opened it and put a book at the base of the door to prevent it from closing. Nothing happened for a few minutes but then I heard something. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to see.

There were two creatures, one swinging off the door handle and the other trying to pull the book away. They were about the size if a rat, but they had a more humanoid form, except for the head which was far too big for their puny bodies. They were covered from head to toe in slimy green scales and their eyes made them look like cartoon characters seeing they were about the size of golf balls.

When they saw me they let out a pathetic little scream before taking off out the door. I took off out the door with speed that would shame an Olympian. But I couldn’t find them anywhere. I searched the whole house top to bottom but there was still no evidence of their existence. 

I decided I would call an exterminator to get rid of them. But when I got back to the study my phone was missing and in its place was what looked like my dogs tongue. I felt rage like nothing I have ever experienced and decided I would go to town and get help. But the keys were missing and instead was my dogs ear having on the Key hanger. I felt sick, they took my dog. And for the cherry on top they locked the windows and the front and back door so there is no way out without breaking my window which I can’t afford to replace.

After the most lonely night of my life I then realised they didn’t take the computer and raced to the office to double check. My computer was there so decided to write this and look for advise. And I keep seeing their evil heads popping out from the door but no matter what I do I cannot catch them. Somebody please help, I don’t want them to hurt my dog any further.

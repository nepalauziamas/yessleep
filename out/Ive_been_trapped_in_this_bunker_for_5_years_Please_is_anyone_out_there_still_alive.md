_Daily report: David Robert Jones._  
_Time elapsed since the start of infestation: 1827 days._  


***


I was jolted back to consciousness, by the sound of a blaring
alarm. The airlock had been breached, and I knew exactly why.
Without getting dressed, I shot out of bed, and rushed towards
the blast doors. There, equipped in a protective suit, with only a
singular can of oxygen, stood Charles.


“What are you doing?” I asked through the speaker system.


He turned towards the exit, ripping a quarantine sign off the
door.


“I'm leaving!”


“Charles, don't be stupid, you won't last a day. Remember
Henderson?”


He nodded, but kept working on the door. In a matter of
minutes, he would break through the seal, and leave the safety
of our bunker.


Truth be told, it wasn't concern for his well being, that made
me want to keep him. It was rather the fear of being alone.
After four deaths in the span of a year, we were the only two
left.


“You heard the transmission, David. There are people out there,
a place we can live, free of these concrete walls. Maybe they've
already killed the parasites.”



I quickly grabbed the emergency code, and started initiating
lock down. I couldn't let him leave without a fight.


“That message was years old. Whoever sent it, they must have
died ages ago!”


He sighed, “don't try to stop me, this is my decision.”


“But, you'll die,” I argued futilely.


He paused, and turned back around to face me. He hadn't
shaved in a few weeks, and his eyes looked bloodshot. We
hadn't seen the day of light in years, not since the infestation
started, five years earlier.


“You remember what they said before putting us down here?”
he asked. “That once the air cleared, we'd rise from our
colonies, together?”


I shook my head. Of course I remembered, we were chosen to
survive the inevitable end. Yet, no sooner had they sealed the
doors behind us, before they fell over dead. We'd been
abandoned by sentient life.


“You've gotta let me go,” he said in a somber tone.


“I don't wanna be alone.”


“You already are.”


With that, he opened the door, revealing a narrow tunnel with a
ladder. He'd have to climb a hundred feet up to reach the
surface, a trek that would diminish a significant portion of his oxygen supply.


As he closed the airlock, I rushed to the surveillance room. Out
of the two dozen cameras we started with, only three remained.
At least I'd get to see Charles leave the perimeter.


With a sigh, I turned the cameras on. Witnessing the outside
world was always a topic of dread. Just remembering a time
where the planet thrived with vegetation and life, only to see
the barren wasteland left behind by the parasites.


Without a functional, portable radio to keep in touch with
Charles, I could only watch as he walked away. As with all the
others, I knew he'd perish.


I sat back in my chair, and calculated how long the supplies
could last me. Dried and canned foods, all meant to last a
decade. Without Charles and the rest of the crew, it could keep
me going for a lifetime.


An hour passed, and I kept my eyes glued to the screen,
waiting for Charles' return. I figured he'd have enough oxygen
for three hours top.


I tended to the daily maintenance tasks, and started my report.
Though we'd long since lost contact with high-command, we
still sent updates on day to day occurrences.


I let my mind drift, contemplating if living inside this empty
prison was worth it. My train of thoughts was quickly
interrupted by movement on the cameras.


“Let me in!” Charles shouted.


“I can't do that, Charles. You know the rules.”


“Please, I'm almost out of air.”


I could hear him struggling as the oxygen ran out. Despite his
most valiant effort, he wouldn't be able to resist the temptation
of removing his mask. After all, human instincts are hard to
ignore.


As he collapsed to the ground, he gave in, and removed the
mask. For a second, he seemed to regain his strength. But, then
the parasites got a hold of his airways. Invisible little buggers,
digging into this body.


At first, it was just a cough, but within minutes, he started
puking up chunks of his own guts. Blood, lung tissue, and
whatever flesh the creatures could get, disintegrated within
him.


There was no cure, no discrimination. These things attacked
anything from humans, to animals, to plants. Once food had
run out on the surface, they still refused to die. Instead, they
entered a dormant state, waiting for anything to disturb their
slumber.


“I'm sorry, Charles. I wish you hadn't left,” I said as he drew
his last, agonized breath of tainted air.


Watching my last partner die, I went into autopilot. Despite my
emotions, it was just another thing to file on my daily report. A
pathetic routine to keep me sane.


If anyone receives this, please get me out of here.

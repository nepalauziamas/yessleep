So I’m a bit of a horror movie fan. Whether it be about murderers or the supernatural, I love watching all types of horror movies ever since I was a kid.

I’m an adult now, but I was experiencing this particular nightmare several times during middle school. I remember I watched the horror movie, “the grudge”, and it scared the hell out of me. Everything about the ghost in that movie scared me, her long, dark and wet hair, the way she crawls on the floors and ceilings and, most of all, the sound she makes when she’s coming for you. Later on in the movie, I found out that it’s also the last sound she made before she died. It’s almost like a groan. For those who haven’t heard it, I recommend looking it up so you really understand my experience in the nightmare. I slept with my mom on the night I watched the movie. I needed the company. After that, I was alright for at least a year. Then I had the nightmare for the first time.

In my nightmare, I’m sitting on the floor and my back is against a wall. Everything around me is pitch black. I can’t see anything except for a part of the floor in front of me because it’s like there’s a spotlight from above pointing there. That moment of confusion lasted for a few seconds before I heard the ghost from the grudge. She was making that groaning sound but I couldn’t see her. It sounded like she was coming towards me from in front of me, beyond the spotlight. It was getting louder. I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to stay where the light was because I was scared of what could be in the dark, but she easily knew where I was. I was frozen in place just waiting for her. I felt helpless, like this was her world and she had total control over it. I saw her pale hands first and then her head. It scares me just thinking about it. The nightmare was too vivid. She slowly crawled towards me, closer and closer. Her gaze never changed. She looked dead and heartless. Once she got in the light, I saw she wore a dirty white nightdress. I noticed this because I tried to focus on other things aside from her face to help me stay as calm as possible. I thought I would die of a heart attack before she got to me if I stared at her face. I noticed I couldn’t move at all. She crawled up my legs, her groan was deafening by now. I don’t remember when, but at some point, I realized this was a nightmare. I was screaming in my mind, trying to remember a prayer, wondering what she was going to do to me, and trying to force my eyes open to wake up, all at the same time, but she kept getting closer. She looked at me with big, glassy eyes and came so close that our faces were about 3 inches apart….

I think I must’ve died from fright in the nightmare. That must’ve been the only way to wake up, because after that, I opened my eyes and stared at my room’s ceiling. I didn’t move until the sun came up. I didn’t want to look around the room. I didn’t want to see anything else.

I had that nightmare for several nights. I used to cry and tell my mom I didn’t want to sleep anymore. She would tell me to pray every time, but I couldn’t remember the prayers in the nightmare. I used to fumble and mix up the words or I couldn’t remember them at all. I guess I was too scared. It came to a point where I stopped being scared and got tired and angry at the ghost instead. I would yell at her and ask her “what do you want from me?!” I told her to leave me alone and used to swear at her and acted like I’m not scared. I’d close my eyes when she came close and distracted myself from her groans by thinking of random things until I woke up. 

I always woke up at the same time, when she was 3 inches away from my face. Thankfully, I stopped having that nightmare, but whenever I tell someone about it, I’m scared that I’ll have it again. I used to see her sometimes in my dreams. She’ll poke her head out from one of the ceiling tiles but nothing more. She doesn’t groan or come down, just stares. I haven’t seen her for a long time now though. I hope it stays that way.

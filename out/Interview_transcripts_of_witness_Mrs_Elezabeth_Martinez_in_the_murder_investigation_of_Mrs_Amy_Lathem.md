Q. “Mrs. Martinez when you're ready, can you tell us what happened on the 19th of May, the day before Mrs. Lathem was killed, from the beginning, please. When did Mr. Keane first contact you?” 

A. “I was at home watching tv with my son, when I heard a knock on the door.” 

Q. “What time was that?” 

A. “It was after 7pm, I thought it was the pizza guy, we had just ordered a few minutes before, I remember been impressed how fast he came. When I opened the door and saw him standing there, I was in shock, I didn’t know what to say, I just stared at him with my mouth open.” 

Q. “When you say him, you mean Mr. Keane?” 

A. “Yes, it was so weird, he didn’t say anything, he stared straight through me, his eyes looked empty, he didn’t even blink, like he was in a trance.” 

Q. “While he was like that, did you try to escape?” 

A. “I wanted to, but I was afraid of what he might do to me if he caught me, so I waited for him to make the first move.” 

Q. “When he came out of his trance what did he do?” 

A. “First, he started breathing heavily like he was gasping for air, for a moment I thought he was hurt, until I saw his face begin to change.” 

Q. “When you say change, you mean?” 

A. “His lip started trembling and I could see his pupils get bigger and bigger until it covered nearly his whole eye, he was grinding his teeth so hard I heard something crack, then he started breathing really heavily. I was so scared, I burst into tears, I had never seen anything like that before. That’s when he caught me by the throat and pushed me up against the wall.” 

Q. “Did he say anything?”  

A. “Yes, he whispered ‘Where is Amy, where is Amy’ in my ear over and over again, he spoke so fast, for a finish the words just blended together into one. I didn’t know what to do so, I wrapped my arms around him and squeezed, I hoped there was still some part of my brother in there that might take pity on me, and it worked, that cold dead look he had in his face melted away and I could see my brother again. Soon he was back to his normal self, apart from not remembering the last 5 years.” 

A. “We know he insisted that he never remembered attacking Mrs. Lathem back in 2012, but surely, he must have remembered the trial, or his sentence, something. I suppose lucky for you, weren’t you one of the key witnesses for the prosecutor?” 

A. “Yes, but I didn’t want to testify against him, I had no choice.” 

Q. “Thats not what I heard. Ok, where was your son while all this was happening?” 

A. “He was still sitting on the couch watching TV.” 

Q. “Did Mr. Keane have any interactions with him?” 

A. “I think so, he pushed past me, and started searching the house, I assumed he was looking for Amy, he probably saw Toby then, but I can’t be certain” 

Q. “While he was gone what did you do?” 

A. “I didn’t do anything, I just stood there in a daze, until he came back, he then grabbed me and started screaming for Amy at the top of his lungs. To try calm him down I took his hand, squeezed it, and asked him to come with me to the living room, where I sat him down and tried to explain what had happened. For a while, it was going ok, I told him he had been gone for the last 5 years, he even took the news that Amy had moved on and was remarried, really well, but when I mentioned prison, his eyes glazed over, and he started acting weird again.” 

Q. “I see here that Toby ended up with the babysitter that day, when did this happen?” 

A. “My brother was mumbling to himself about going home and just walked out the door, I think he believed Amy would be there waiting for him, and that I was trying to prank him. I didn’t know how he would react when he found out someone else was living there so, the second he walked out that door I told Toby to run over to Karens, she lived across the street, I told him I would collect him later.” 

Q. “Who is living in Mr. Keane's old house now?” 

A. “The Thomsons.”  

Q. “Ok. Why didn’t you go with Toby, or tell him to send help or at least call the police?” 

A. “He only wanted me, I thought if he came back, and both of us were gone he would come looking for us, this way at least Toby was safe. I was going to ring the cops when I knew Toby was safe, but he came back before I got the chance.” 

Q. “How long was Mr. Keane gone? The Thomson's house is what 5-10 minutes' walk and Karens is maybe 3. How did he get back before you got a chance to get out of there.” 

A. “Am, I don’t know how long he was gone, a few minutes I suppose, it was a really stressful and scary time for me, I can’t remember what happened, I must have frozen again, and lost track of time.” 

Q. “What did he do when he returned? Did he notice Tobies absence?” 

A. “No, I don’t think he even knew I was there half the time; he was in his own world. He kept rambling around the house, whispering to himself. That was the worst night of my life, he sent me to bed at around 9, but he kept coming into my room, I often found him standing over me smiling, he would stay like that for about 5 or 10 minutes before disappearing into the darkness.” 

Q. “How long was he in that state?” 

A. “The whole night.” 

Q. “Did he leave the premises at any point during the night that you are aware of?” 

A. “I am not sure, I may have fallen asleep at one point, so he might have.” 

Q. “You fell asleep?” 

A. “When I get stressed, I get really tired, I can’t help it.” 

Q. “Well, that’s the first. Ok the next morning what happened?” 

A. “I woke to the sound of sirens, at first, I thought it was the police coming to rescue me, but then I looked out the window and saw the fire truck at the Thomsons house.” 

Q. “Do you think it was Mr. Keane that lit the fire?” 

A. “Well, yeah who else would have done something like that.” 

Q. “Were you friendly with the Thomsons?” 

A. “Ok, we did have a disagreement over the sale of my brother's house, I wanted it but they bought it right out from underneath me, so I was a little pissed for a while. But we are all past that now, we even had dinner with them a few weeks back.” 

Q. “I’m sorry Mrs. Martinez but I have to ask, did you directly or indirectly have anything got to do with the Thomsons fire?” 

A. “Of course not.” 

Q. “Ok, we’ll move on from that, for now. Why did you drive Mr. Keane to meet Mrs. Lathem In the city?”  

A. “I had no choice; he became extremely aggressive when I tried to say no and started grunting at me.” 

Q. “Grunting?” 

A. “Yeah, he was like a wild animal, I thought he was going to bite me or something. He only calmed down when I said I would take him, but I made him promise not to hurt her.”  

Q. “When you drove him to the city, did he tell you what he was going to do with her.” 

A. “No, but I didn’t think he was going to hurt her, he was smiling the whole way.” 

Q. “It never occurred to you that he might hurt her again, considering he broke out of prison, after he was put in there for nearly beating her to death in the first place.” 

A. “At that point, I didn’t know he escaped, I knew his sentence was nearly up, so I assumed they just released him, and I hadn’t much of a choice, I couldn’t just say no to him, could I?” 

Q. “Thats another thing, have you any idea why he might have tried to escape so suddenly when he had only a few weeks left in his sentence?” 

A. “My brother is unwell, who knows why he does anything.” 

Q. “Ok Mrs. Martinez when you got to the café what happened?” 

A. “As we were getting out of the car, he saw her husband and started to freak out, I tried to convince him to go in anyways, at least that way she would have her husband to protect her, but he chickened out and we watched her from the car for about 20 minutes before he sent me in.” 

Q. “Why did you take her to the car, when you could have used that opportunity to escape, it was a busy day there were people everywhere, surely someone would have helped if he came after you, so there was no reason for you to go back?” 

A. “I was afraid he would hurt my son if I didn’t do what he said.” 

Q. “You do realize your son was an hour away? The police would have been there long before he ever got to your son.” 

A. “Obviously, I wasn’t thinking straight, do you have any idea what it is like to be held hostage by someone like that, I never knew who I was talking to from one minute to the next.” 

Q. “I am sorry Mrs. Martinez; I am only trying to find out what happened. So how did you convince her to come to the car?” 

A. “As I was walking up to the café, she saw me through the window, and I beckoned her outside where I told her I had a surprise in the car. When she got to there she jumped right in, I never expected her to do that, I thought she would have seen my brother and ran away before she got anywhere near him. But he was hiding in the back seat. When I tried to get in, he grabbed me by the neck and put me in the boot.” 

Q. “You're saying he physically dragged you to the boot and put you inside?” 

A. “Yes.” 

Q. “Why didn’t you let yourself out? There was a leaver on the inside to prevent these kinds of situations from happening. Plus, the back seat easily folds down so you could have got into the car at any time.” 

A. “I did when he slammed on the brakes, and I heard her scream, I think I was in shock up until then.” 

Q. “What did you see when you entered the back seat?” 

A. “She was trying to get out the passenger's door, and he was trying to stop her, so, I grabbed the tire iron and tried to hit him.” 

Q. “So that’s how you got your fingerprints on the murder weapon, right? But how come he didn’t have a mark on him, and you ended up with her blood all over you?” 

A. “I hit the ceiling instead and he ripped it out of my hand and started hitting her repeatedly, I tried to stop him, but he just pushed me out of the way.” 

Q. “Ok can we slow things down for a minute. Before you gave him the tire iron, did he say anything to Mrs. Lathem, besides trying to stop her from leaving was he being overly aggressive to her? Did he look like he was going to hurt her?” 

A. “I didn’t give him the murder weapon; he took it from me. He was begging her not to go, I suppose he wasn’t too aggressive.” 

Q. “So if he wasn’t being aggressive towards her why did you try to hit him with the tire iron?” 

A.” I don’t know she was scared, and I thought he was going to hurt her again, so I just reacted. Come to think of it I think he might have threatened to kill her, I think that's when I got the tire iron.” 

Q. “Are you sure because a minute ago you said he was calm and begged her not to go, now you're saying he threatened to kill her.” 

A. “I am sorry, everything happened so fast, I must have forgotten that until now.” 

Q. “Ok where were we, right, you gave him the tire iron and?” 

A. “I told you I didn’t give it to him, he took it off me when I hit him.” 

Q. “Excuse me a minute, when did you hit him, like I said he didn’t have a mark on him, and you said, ‘I hit the ceiling instead and he ripped it out of my hand’ is that right.” 

A. “All I remember is swinging it, I don’t know for sure, if I hit him.” 

Q. “Fine. What happened next.” 

A. “After hitting her a number of times he suddenly stopped, and his eyes glazed over again. That’s when I took my chance and I pulled her from the car and tried to stop the bleeding, that’s how I got her blood on me, but by then it was too late she was gone.” 

Q. “So, while this was going on Mr. Keane just sat there quietly waiting for the police to arrive, is that right? 

A. “Yes.” 

Q. “Ok, is there anything else you would like to add before I process this?” 

A. “No, that’s about it.” 

Transcript from follow up interview of Mrs. Elezabeth Martinez 

Case number: 173672640 

Date:02/06/2017 

Reporting Officer: 

Q. “I am sorry Mrs. Martinez, we found some inconsistencies in your previous statement, we just need to clear a few things up, so please bear with me. You told one of our officers you had no contact with Mr. Keane the whole time he was in prison, yet there was a letter delivered to him with your name on it on the morning of his escape, how was that possible?”  

A. “I honestly have no idea, someone must have used my name, I don’t know.”  

Q. “Can you tell me why you were the only one to witness Mr. Keane's violent behavior? Since we took him into custody, he has had many episodes like you described, from our experience he seemed very docile, even easily suggestible when he is in that kind of state.” 

A. “Maybe when he killed Amy he fulfilled his mission, I don’t know, I am not a psychiatrist.” 

Q. “But your husband is, isn’t he?” 

A. “Yes.” 

Q. “And didn’t he treat Mr. Keane after his accident back in 2011?” 

A. “Yes, my brother had a work accident. He was trapped in a collapsed building for 2 days before they found him, he nearly died. He was so traumatized by the event he blocked it out, his mind was never right after that, my husband was trying to help him remember so he could face up to what had happened, in hopes of curing him.” 

Q. “How was your husband treating Mr. Keane?” 

A. “Hypnosis I believe.” 

Q. “When did Mr. Keane start having these blackouts was it before or after your husband's treatment?” 

A. “Are you trying to say my husband had something got to do with Amy’s death. He wasn’t even in town when she was murdered.” 

Q. “No Mrs. Martinez sometimes hypnosis has been known to trigger things like this, we just want to know when he first started blacking out.” 

A. “I had enough of these questions, I came here in my own free will, I'm done.” 

Q. “Ok I'm sorry Mrs. Martinez. Just one more thing and we’re done.  Your brother got a very large settlement after his accident back in 2011, with Amy dead and your brother almost certain to get the death penalty. Who gets control of your brothers' estate?”

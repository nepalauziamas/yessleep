So are you ever lying in bed at night and then you randomly look at your chair and think you see a person. But it's just a pile of clothes.. right?That's what I thought.

This happened about 2 hours ago

I was sitting up in bed unable to sleep and I saw my desk chair, it looked awfully like a person. I blew it off and tried to fall asleep again but it wasn't like a usual random pile of clothes. I looked again and I could very clearly make out the features of a human. So to put my paranoia to rest I got out of bed and walked over to the pile and touched the top shirt. As I thought, it was just a t-shirt.

But it was warm.

Unnaturally warm.

It was damp.

But it was just a t-shirt.

"It was probably just on the radiator or something drying," I thought.

I was confused but not 'troubled'. I got back into bed and lay on my side facing the wall, so I wouldn't be able to have any of my paranoid sights again. A few minutes later, I feel something on my ear.

It's wet and warm.

I scream and jump out of bed and feel my ear. On my ear, is the same t-shirt I found. I throw it as far as I can (which is my door)

I run to the light switch and slam my hand against it. I suffer from paranoia a lot so I keep a small baseball bat (for the game Rounders) against the wall, so I pick it up and hold it with both hands.

I stand in the corner with my Rounders bat in my hands but the room is not illuminated.

It's still dark, not pitch black but I'm very limited on vision.

I drop the bat and I get my quivering hand to slam against the light switch again but nothing.

I keep switching my vision to the darkness and the switch and keep flipping it like a child who's just discovered a switch.

I give up on the switch and jump to my closet, still keeping an eye on what could be absolutely nothing.

I pull out drawers and slam them shut again, hoping to find a light source.

Suddenly, I see a torch and grab it.

I flick it on and my room is immediately (partially) illuminated.

And I lay my eyes on my enemy.

Nothing.

Just an empty room.

I'm still shaking and with my torch still lit, I hobble towards the door. I retrieve the rounders band and hold it in my right hand, torch in the left.

I then put the torch in my mouth and grip it with my teeth so I have a free hand to open the door. As I face away from the room and hold the door I feel **two** **slimy hands on my neck.** I shriek turn around while still holding the bat and swing in the general direction of the **thing**. The torch in my mouth illuminates it.

It was a humanoid creature standing upright, even in the light it was still black. Have you ever seen that paint that was made "The Blackest Black"? well, it was that. It had no shadow, nothing. Its skin was not scaly, it was just pitch black void, abyss, nothingness. It had no face, no eyes, just an abyss.

I had struck it clean in its torso and it gave out a shriek. It had no mouth to open but it still shrieked.

It stopped standing upright and acted like it was about to pounce so I hurried to open the door I had only begun opening and jumped behind it. The torch was still in my mouth so I dropped it out with the bat and used both of my hands to try and slam the door shut. As my hand went towards the handle an arm from the other side reached out and grabbed my left hand. I'm right-handed so I still pulled the door tight while my hand was being pulled through the gap between the door and the wall.

It was so strong it pulled my whole arm through the crack and I was about to go through myself.

With all my might, I slammed my body AGAINST the door opening it which slammed the door open into the creature whose grip on my arm fell. I fell to the floor and crawled to grab the bat. The torch was on the floor and illuminated the doorway where I could see the entity. It got to its feet and began charging towards the still prone me. As it ran I swung the bat at its ankles and fortunately it tripped and smashed its head straight into a vase.

While it was down I used the time to stand up and grab my flashlight. I ran back towards the entity, who was recovering. I slammed the bat on its head once again but it did not go down. It continued getting back up and I tried to swing again but with otherworldly speed, it caught the bat and got it out of my hands. I knew I would not survive another fight with this thing so I ran out to my front door and found my lighter in my keyholder. I opened my front door and slammed it before me as I ran out. My lighter was in my pocket and my torch in my left hand again and the bat in my right. I began sprinting down the road.

Suddenly, I heard a scream from away from me and a door slam open.

I continue running for my life until I hear another scream.

And another.

And another.

I get to the end of my street and look back.

Multiple of those things.

Crawling on all fours.

Towards me.

Then, another shrieks comes out in the house right next to where I'm running and another entity jumps out running toward me.

I keep sprinting as the things are getting inches away

I turn right onto a road

I keep running until I realise I'm in a culdesac.

I turn around and running back would result in my death so I keep sprinting to the end of the culdesac.

I see a house with an open door and I run into it, I slam the door behind me.Suddenly and quite, fortunately, I spot a phone on the table so I grab it and find the back door of the house. My idiotic self does not grab a knife or anything so I just run out and go straight into a park behind the house. Behind me, I hear those things crawling people's houses.

That was twenty minutes ago.

I found a small passageway into the local forest and ran into what seems to be someone's old campsite. I used the lighter to create a small fire and I am currently using a stranger's phone and reddit account to write this.

Those piles of clothes in your room.

# THEY'RE ALIVE

**They don't take hits well but have lots of grip strength.**

As of right now, I can see lots of them enclosing on the group of trees where I'm hiding.

It's always a pile of clothes.

But it's never **JUST** a pile of clothes.

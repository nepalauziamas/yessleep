I am a 13 year old male and I have a cousin that says that you can see ghosts and most of my family believes her.

I have talked with my grandmother about the situation and she believes that it is real

She says there are two ghosts the "Friendly" One and the "Mean one" which is older and if you are feeling skeptical about this, trust me I was too but I believe it now 

My little cousin says that the "Mean Ghost" Had made my older cousin (14) have trouble breathing when they were still living at the old old house, and it kinda scares me.

It's weird because my little cousin stopped seeing ghosts after she moved out of her old, creepy house

If you need proof, Here it is. A few years ago my aunt (21 at the time) Witnessed a car crash and the person who died was named Michael. One day near the present me and my grandma had been chasing my cousin's Siberian Husky dog Hachi and so we stopped by a graveyard because my little cousin wanted to so then we passed by a gravestone my cousin pointed at it and she said so then we passed by a gravestone my cousin pointed at it and she said " hey that day was exactly like the ghost name and the tombstone read "Michael"

this cuz stuff had a lot of my family members cuz stuff has had a lot of my family members paranoid because sometimes my little cousin Legend scary stuff about the ghost and if I'm being honest you know more about the nice one than the mean one which is good and sometimes with my cousin mentions the ghost it's usually out of nowhere with freaks me out sometimes

My cousin gets scared when we mention the ghosts mostly because she is scared about moving into the new house because she is used to it being and this is her first time moving

Another Story is that she was sitting on the ground and started waving and looking up and she said that she was waving to the "Mean Ghost" and my grandma believes Michael is the nice ghost which if I am being honest makes the most sense in my opinion

when my grandmother was using the bathroom my little cousin will stick by my little cousin was sitting by her and she was looking up and waving at the ceiling my grandma asked: "what are you waving at?" and my cousin responded "the ghost"

she hasn't talked about the ghost since she moved out of her old house and I feel like the ghost is connected to the house somehow what do you guys think?

anyways that was my story I had to stretch it out a bit but to be clear the story is 100% and my writings in the best if you guys like this post just tell me if you guys want to be updated if my cousin mentions it it the ghost again.

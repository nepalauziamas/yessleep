I recently went on a small vacation, if you could even call it that. Basically me and a couple of my friends stayed at a low end hotel for a few nights and just drank and fucked around. Anyways I had to leave earlier than the rest of my friends because I had work the next day and so I decided to leave early around 8 AM, mostly because I had around a 4 hour drive before I got home.  


The beginning parts of the drive home were typical and boring. Mainly just listening to whatever song was playing on the radio. About an hour in, I got low on gas so I had to stop and fill up my car at some random local gas station. I hadn't ate yet so I decided to grab something to eat and a drink while I was there. 

&#x200B;

"Can I just get these please?" I asked the cashier behind the counter

&#x200B;

"That'll be 4 dollars and 52 cents." He replied, emotionless

&#x200B;

I payed him and was walking out the door before he stopped me.

&#x200B;

"I haven't seen you around here before, where are you headed?" He asked

&#x200B;

"I am heading home, I live on XXXXX drive, it's about 3 hours away." I replied confused

&#x200B;

"Whatever you do, don't go down the dirt road before the highway. If you do you won't leave sane." He said

&#x200B;

I laughed and filled my car up. He had to be joking right? Probably just a local joke or myth around here I wasn't aware of. I got into my car and headed down the road. 

&#x200B;

About half an hour later I was nearing a highway the one I came from. However this time, there was a lot of traffic. Like nearly miles of traffic. I quickly called one of my friends and got him to see what the hell was causing all this traffic.

&#x200B;

"There was some sort of terrible crash, you're going to be stuck there for hours." He told me.

&#x200B;

I thanked him and hung up. I didn't have hours, I needed to get home quickly because I had work tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

That's when I noticed it. 

&#x200B;

A small dirt road to the left of the main road. If I went down it, I might be able to make it home on time. The only thing is I don't remember the dirt road being here when I came up here.

&#x200B;

Remembering what the cashier said I was a little nervous maybe a little scared, but I turned off the main road and onto the small dirt road. 

&#x200B;

The drive was surprisingly normal at first, nothing out of the ordinary.

&#x200B;

About 15 minutes in, I started seeing things.

&#x200B;

Not directly, but I swear to you I started to see things out of my peripheral vision. Not people or anything but shadows. The shadows were 7-8 feet tall and they were portrayed against the trees. I started getting a feeling of unease, but I continued driving anyways.

&#x200B;

30 minutes in, the whispering started. At first it was faint and quiet, but as time passed the whispers got more louder and more unintelligible. I started regretting my choices but I couldn't turn back now. 

&#x200B;

An hour in, I started actually seeing things but they weren't actually there. I know this because I saw my wife in the road and almost crashed to try to avoid hitting her but I still did anyways, but I kind of just phased through her and when I looked in the rearview mirror, she wasn't there. 

&#x200B;

I started seeing things in my car meanwhile the whispers getting louder and the shadows engulfing the trees around me.

&#x200B;

Eventually me seeing things got so bad I swear to god I thought it was night despite it only being 1ish in the afternoon.

&#x200B;

I eventually got off that road and made it home.

&#x200B;

Things unfortunately didn't end there however. I started seeing a tall completely black figure in the woods around my house. It was probably around 8 feet tall and had completely black eyes that looked like endless pits.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do so me and my wife just locked our doors and windows. 

&#x200B;

I retreated to my bedroom and I got another really bad sense of unease and my gut telling me to get my gun.

&#x200B;

I trusted my gut and loaded my Colt Python that I got for my birthday a few years ago.

&#x200B;

I heard breaking glass and I saw the creature in my house. I pulled the trigger three times and I think I killed it.

&#x200B;

I called for my wife and looked all over for her.

&#x200B;

I went back into the room where I killed the "creature."  


My wife was there bleeding on the floor with three .357 bullet holes in her.

&#x200B;

The creature in my house was a hallucination.

&#x200B;

The whispers continue to grow louder and occasionally I hear a laugh and I still see the real creature in the woods around my house,

&#x200B;

Once this uploads here I think I am going to turn the gun on myself.

  I’ve finally decided to share a personal story from childhood that I’ve kept to myself for so long. My entire life I’ve been told that it was just my imagination, since I was so young at the time. 

It all happened around 6 years ago when I was around 13-14 years of age. I lived with my family ( my sister, brother, mother, and my father) on the outskirts of Ky in a very small town. 

The town always gave me the creeps, it was always quiet and I was the only kid I ever saw, there was also a huge graveyard for a town with a population of roughly only 300. I didn’t think too much of it though, i was just an innocent child back then.

At such a young age obviously kids liked to make things up, imaginary friends and what not. But I know what happened in that town was real and I could never forget the things I saw then. 

We lived a few doors down from a local butcher shop. It was called “Frank and Kelly’s Butcher” we’d go down to it every now and then but what always stood out to me was that Kelly— or Franks wife, was always the one at the counter greeting people, I never actually saw Frank at the time.

At some point the shop took a turn for the worse and was starting to head towards bankruptcy because their meat dealer was out of stock. Until suddenly they closed down. Since it was such a small town everyone was talking about it. Everyone was curious about what happened. But the weeks went on like normal, only without the shop.

*CHOP CHOP*

I was suddenly woken up by the familiar sound of a knife hitting a table, and the sound of it going through the bones and flesh. It was really loud though. Loud and fast, like if you were angry while preparing dinner.

*CHOP CHOP*

Again and again I heard that sound. It was loud enough for me to hear in my bedroom which like I said was a few doors down from the shop. It was annoying, but I somehow managed to get some sleep. 

The next day to everyones surprise the butcher shop was back open. Once we went in there I was surprised to finally see Frank at the front counter instead of Kelly. Frank was really tall and heavy set. His face was scarred and he had a long messy beard. He was pretty intimidating to say the least. Once he spoke I noticed that he had a very deep voice and always sounded like he had mucus in his throat.

Whenever someone asked about how the shop got back open he said “I just took out a loan and got my meat from a different supplier.” but he sounded annoyed every time someone asked about it. In terms of asking about Kelly he said that she was out of town visiting relatives, which eventually turned into, “We went our separate ways.”

* CHOP CHOP*

Once again. I heard that noise. The loud and fast slamming down of a knife. That night the curiosity and headache got the best of me so I went to check it out. It was already around 12am but I was young and didn’t know any better. Once I got to the entrance the noise was so loud I had to cover my ears. I could also hear grunting and cussing. It was Frank.

I went into the shop and ducked behind the counter, but I was clumsy and stubbed my toe, causing me to fall into the counter.

*CHOP*

The noise stopped. Frank quickly came out from the back of the shop. Breathing heavily. I covered my mouth and laid down as to not be seen. Frank then went passed me, thankfully not noticing me. He left the shop pacing up and down the street looking for someone. (me) I quickly ran into the back of the shop hoping to find a back door.

As soon as I entered the back I fell back in horror almost screaming. My eyes were wide. Staring back at me no more then 4 feet away was the head of Kelly with a butchers knife sticking out of her neck. Her body missing parts and chunks of it. 

I wanted to vomit. I now see Franks new “supplier” for meat. I didn’t want to see any more. So I farted home and tried my best to sleep off the fear. I never should’ve gone into that butcher shop…

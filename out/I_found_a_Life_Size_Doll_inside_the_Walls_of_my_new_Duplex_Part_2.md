Macie’s words echoed the thoughts in my head. Where the HELL had that fucking creepy doll gone. 

I tried to not panic. 

“Maybe you moved it while you were sleepwalking,” I said, keeping my voice down as I pushed the clothes around in the closet. Even in the dark I could tell that it was definitely not here. 

“Are you kidding? That thing was heavy. How could I do that?” she asked as I climbed back out. 

She was getting out her phone and about to dial 911 but I stopped her before she finished. “What are you doing? They’ll think we’re nuts.” 

She sighed in frustration. “At least let me call my dad. Maybe he can come tonight.”

I passed the phone back to her, looking around the rest of the dark apartment. That thing could be lurking anywhere, I thought. 

No. Fuck get a hold of yourself. I was being crazy. There was a logical explanation for this. Macie sleepwalking could have given her the strength to move it without realizing it. There was no danger. 

Still, I felt compelled to search as she dialed a second time. 

“I swear that he could sleep through a bomb dropping,” she muttered in frustration as it went to voicemail again. 

I checked all the places I felt that her addled brain might have hauled the weird doll to like the bathroom and the other guest room but found nothing. Just a chilly creepy house where a doll was apparently hiding. 

“Maybe we should just get some sleep,” I advised, trying to calm my nerves. 

We walked to the bedroom and I opened the door. Behind me, Macie lit a candle and I jumped out of my skin again.

 We saw the doll’s silhouette was there, sitting up in the bed. “Jesus Fucking Christ,” Macie said as she walked in and saw it. Getting closer with the candle I watched as my partner was brave enough to get a closer look. 

Weirdly it also had clothes on now, a blue jersey that I recognized from my partner’s wardrobe. And it seemed like the doll’s hair had been combed. How could she have so meticulously done all of this in her sleep? 

The way it sat there, just staring lifelessly into the void; it unsettled me. Macie squeezed my hand and backed out to the hallway, closing the door back. 

“I am not going to be spending the night with that thing in the apartment,” she insisted. 

“Thank God we are on the same page,” I said, a wave of relief coming over me. 

Still, I knew I couldn’t completely relax until we knew what the fuck was going on. 

As we moved to the den, my mind fumbled to wake completely and think of what to do. 

“This is such a fucking nightmare. We can’t exactly go to sleep in the moving truck,” I said as I unlatched the door and looked out toward the street. 

It was nearly eleven, but only a few street lights were on. The entire neighborhood felt eerie now, our little slice of it suddenly out of place. Then I noticed that the lights were on in our neighbors side of the duplex and I tugged at Macie. 

“We could ask him for help?” I suggested. 

She gave me the stink eye. “I’d rather take my chances and sleep wrong in the truck,” she remarked. 

“Don’t be like that. You can’t risk calling into work. You just started and you need to make a good impression. Besides, maybe he knows something about the doll or the previous owner?” I said. 

She rolled her eyes, sighing as we walked over to his door and I rapped my knuckles on the panel. 

“For the record this is a bad idea,” Macie commented. We heard him as he went to the door, opening it and glaring at us both like we were a pair of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

“This better be fucking important I go to work in an hour,” he grumbled. 

“Sorry, I guess we got off on the wrong foot earlier. I’m Trish and this is Macie,” I said, gesturing to my partner. “I don’t give a crap if you are Adam and Eve. Or is it Adam and Steve for gays?” 

He laughed to himself and then placed his hand on the door hinge, getting ready to slam it in our face. 

“I know it’s late but we were hoping maybe you could help us out with a favor?” I said as I saw Macie’s eyes flare with anger again. 

“We’ll pay you!” I added. 

He laughed again and started to close it. Just as he did I shouted out. “Did you know anything about the previous owner?” 

We stood there for a second and Macie huffed. “I told you this was a bad idea. I’m headed to the truck,” she commented. 

Then the door creaked open again, the man looking at me with a bit less suspicion. 

“How much?” he asked. 

I pulled out my wallet. “I’ve got forty five dollars.” 

He bit his bottom lip and snatched the money, and for a second I thought he was going to walk back inside and leave us out in the cold.  

“The last girl… I knew her. Why you ask me that?” he muttered. 

“She… left a lot of her stuff in our duplex. And we’ve been moving it all day. There was this umm… one thing that we just can’t seem to get out of the way and…”


He opened the door all the way, standing mere inches from my face. 

“Is it that fucking doll?” he asked. 

Now it was my turn to be surprised and shocked. 

“Wait. You knew about that?” I said. Macie was speechless. 

“Yeah. That thing is the creepiest shit I have ever seen. She would have full blown conversations with it in the middle of the night. I can’t tell you how many damn times I wanted to go over there and bash the thing to pieces,” he snapped. 

“Well, uh. No skin off our backs if you do that now. For real, the thing weighs like two tons and we want it out of the place,” I commented. 

He stood there for a moment tapping his foot. Acting like a kid that was getting permission to raid the cookie jar. 

“Yeah all right, let me finish getting ready for work,” he said. 

He stepped back into his place and then paused, scratched the back of his head and commented, “Y’all can come in and wait if you want.” 

He walked off to the bathroom and Macie and I soon found ourselves loitering in this stranger’s front room. 

Everything about his place screamed a bachelor. Clothes on the floor, a beer next to the recliner, the television turned all the way up. It was a wonder that he found anything. 

But then the pictures on the walls told a different story, I took a step nearer to get a look and realized that at some point this man had a family. A wife and daughter. 

So where were they now? I wondered as I picked up the portrait. 

Macie coughed in her hand softly and I turned to see he was back in the den wearing scrubs. 

“Sorry,” I muttered as I put the picture down hastily. “You have a lovely family.” 

“Had,” he commented as he reached for the remote and turned the television off. 

“Andrea ran off with some young hotshot a year back after our daughter died,” he commented. Suddenly everything in his place didn’t seem to exhibit the symptoms of a slob. 

Instead I realized it was all tinged with sadness. He was wallowing in grief of a life he couldn’t have anymore. 

“Anyway, let’s go get that fucking doll,” he commented. Macie stepped to the side and offered him a candle as he waltzed over to our apartment. We decided to linger in the door. 
He was back in less than a minute. 

“Hey. Where is the fucking thing?” he asked. 

Macie and I came in, hurrying to the bedroom and finding no evidence the doll had even been there. 

“It was right here,” Macie whispered. She pushed past me to peer into the dark closet. It was empty too. 
“You… you already moved it. Didn’t you?” she whispered to the man. He was just standing there, a bit taken back by her behavior. I actually found it odd as well. Disturbing. 

Then she turned toward the neighbor. “Is this your idea of a joke? This thing is terrorizing us!” she snarled as she pushed him against the wall. I was surprised at how forcefully she did it. “What the fuck do you know about this thing??” 

“Hey, watch your mouth you little bitch!” he snapped back, pointing a finger in her face. 

I pulled Macie off of him as he adjusted his scrubs and started to walk out of the duplex. 

“I knew it was a fucking mistake to come over here again. First it messed her up, now you too,” he muttered. 

I heard him slam our front door open and I crossed my arms in frustration, looking toward Macie. 

“Real smooth,” I grumbled. 

“The guy is a total prick. We don’t need him,” Macie said dismissively. 

“Except for the fact that we apparently have a fucking possessed doll on our hands that nobody can find??” I shouted. 

“It’s not in the house. So at least I can get a little sleep!” she insisted. 

We settled for bed and I stared at the door, peering down the dark hallway. It was so damn cold. 

“I don’t really feel safe here tonight,” I admitted as she finally got comfortable. 

“Go sleep in the truck then,” she grumbled. 

I pursed my lips together, and then walked over and closed our door as tight as I could. Then I tucked in under the covers and sighed, watching  as Macie fell asleep. 
I kept still as to not wake her,  and I was too worried about the doll returning to get a wink of sleep. 

Instead once I was sure that she was out of it, I moved over toward the large vanity in the corner and decided to scoot it to be in front of the door. 

As I did, I heard Macie move about in her sleep and mumble something. Then I saw a glint of metal on the floor and reached for my phone. 

It was a small screw. 

I pushed the vanity a little further and saw that there was a ventilation shaft behind it. 

I knelt down and slowly twisted the screw back in place at the bottom of the vent, then stood up again ready to push the vanity. 

A plop on the carpet drew my attention back downward. 

The screw had fallen out again. And it sounded like something was rattling in the vents. Something bigger than a rat. I made certain the screw was on tight. 

This time I watched as something inside the vents popped the screw out. 

I woke Macie up immediately. 

“What the hell Trish.” 

“We’re sleeping in the truck. No arguments.”

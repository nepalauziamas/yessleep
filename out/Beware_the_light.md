God, God, God. This place is my last hope. Please,  please, please, if you are still around, answer, say something. I feel  so lonely, even though I know i am not alone. I can see them far away, I  can see them via the moonlight that escapes the clouds. They are  sitting there, waiting. Waiting for me to go to sleep, waiting for me to  distract myself for a moment. Waiting for a mistake. Thank God its a  cloudfull night and there are no wild animals around. I think they are  scared of them too. I have been using my phone on the lowest brightness  possible to upload this , but I am still afraid.

As  time goes by, I am getting more and more paranoid. Why are they  allowing me to upload? Why are they not attacking? Is this some kind of  elaborate trap? Are they just taunting me? They know I am afraid of them  and I am not going to lie here, I am. I am terrified. But you must  know, for internet to still exist, that means someone is keeping the  lights on and the machines running. This is why I am here, to tell you  before its too late, TURN THE LIGHTS OFF.

I know i  sound like a madman, but, if you had experienced what I have the last  few days, you would understand me completely. I cant stay awake for much  longer,pain is too great too,one way or another i will be sleeping soon, but I feel the need to try and protect you. Every fiber of my  existence hopes you heed my warning, there is still time for you. My  name is Mark James Reever and this is my story.

  I am  22 years old and I study architecture in a major university. I am not going to mention which one, or exactly where I live, because there is a slight chance they can't leave and I won't risk any of you brave enough to come and see them yourselves. I know its a lot and I know you have no reason to, but I am asking you to trust me on this. Anyways, where was I? God I am so tireddd. No, I need to finish this.

 Last year was a Hell on Earth for me. For extra info, my parents never married, we were living all together but for some reason they never Married. This is important for later. My mom died in a horrific car accident, while the driver never stopped to help her ... It was so bad that we had to bury her in a closed casket. Not even a month passed from her death, when my father announced to me - came out, that he was gay and he was actually married with his husband and had two adoptive children, who I now must get used to call my family. Both Lucas (39)(the husband) and Mary(21) and Lily(14) are great people and I honestly like them, but I just don't feel them like family, unlike what my father demands to feel. They are all (except for my father) very understanding and I think they feel sorry for me too, so they gave me all the space I needed. Mary is living with her husband in a different house, while Lucas and Lily now live with us. 

  

I too never got upset with neither their sexuality, nor the married part. For some reason, it always felt like my father was off. The long trips for work every weekend (sales person), the entire weekdays he  "had to visit his estranged family to try and make up with them", all those extra gifts he bought on Christmas and almost all the times he had to work in New years eve, because he was so important for the business. These and many more, just clicked. He was living a double life, one where my mother was the affair and I was.... the mistake? He says its not like that, they wanted me, he wanted me, but I don't know what to believe anymore.

In the duration of the last few months, I came on a sort of depression. At first, I didn't want to participate in the big family events, then I started eating alone in my room. Then I stopped hanging out with my friends, I deleted my discord and begun ghosting everyone. I broke up with my gf over a silly disagreement and finally, I quit getting out of my room alltogether. My room is in a big old house, where there is a wc connected to the room and I bought with my last money a mini fridge, so, the only reason I had to go out of the room was when I wanted to refill it. Which I was doing every Monday at 8 am, because its the hour nobody else is at home. At first, it was movies, then online games and after those, offline games. I wanted my peace and quiet. Room had everything I needed and there was many times I wasn't exiting my room for whole days. Why should I anyways? 

 For the first few months, my "family" actively tried to "help me". Nowadays, every couple of days Lucas is knocking on my door, trying to make some awkward conversation and Lily brings me every Tuesday some of her self made, chocolate cookies. She knocks three times and walk away. I open the door, take the cookies and leave my tablet on the floor, filled with whichever TV show Dad and Lucas has banned from her to watch because its not "kid friendly". Every week she leaves a note to the tablet about what she wants to see next. Its a little bro sis secret. Besides that, I don't have any interaction with the outside world .

 Tuesday came and my cookies never arrived. I know its not a deal with a contract, but it was happening every week for almost 6 months, so, as you can guess, it was strange. I wrote it off as nothing, and continued playing a game on my pc, until I went numb. Days passed and nobody bothered me. After being in my room for almost a week, my pc was off for days, my phone too, I was mostly thinking and sleeping, always with my noise canceling headphones , without having heard anything from the rest of the house, I, slowly, decided I could at least go check on Lily. I had literally sub zero mood to do anything, but something felt really off. I opened the blinds and saw it was night outside, hadn't really noticed. Well, I was so used to night by now, that I didn't even bother opening the lights, so, I opened the door and crept outside.

 You could hear no noices, nothing at all! Fear overtook me, fear of the unknown, a relic from an old age where you needed all your senses to survive and I felt like I wasn't alone. Someone was in there with me and that someone, I wasn't anxious of meeting. I used the coverage of total darkness to make it to the living room, my room is on second floor and the only way down is an old, stone staircase. I stopped halfway the staircase after I heard something. I heard a click sound. Now, I was sure there was someone in the house with me. At first I felt a relief, thinking that my sleep schedule was just that bad and everyone were simply a sleep, but the moment I reached the bottom of the stairs, my heart sank .


  The entire house was trashed, even walls were broken in some parts. In a closer look, it seemed like it was a lot fist like the holes, but, that's impossible, right? I immediately walked right to my Dads bedroom, to meet with the worse possible view I could see. Dad was on the ground, his body crushed into place, parts were torn apart  and his head was sitting alone on the bed. Next to him was Lucas, with his double barrel shotgun on his hand and his own head crushed, like it was pushed inside, rest body nowhere to be seen. The view was so horrible that I threw up, then and there.



Moments later, I went and picked up the shotgun, which by the way had one of the two guns fired. That felt strange, as I didn't notice anything on the wall and there were no bodies or blood for that matter in the living room. Without any real reason, I looked up and saw the light lamp destroyed, like, he was aiming at that. Why on earth would someone shoot a lamp? I continued to Lilyâ€™s room, which was empty. Not trashed, not bodies around, nothing. None of her things, none of her sheets, nothing ,nothing. It was like nobody had ever lived there. Was I so depressed I imagined the girls? The whole situation after the accident? Should I really visit a therapist? What is happening?



  As I was walking out of the room, I tripped over a plate, my cookies plate. No, I wasn't imagining things, my sister exists! What was until then desperation, turned to anger. With the gun in my hands, I begun shouting Lilys name, without carrying if there were intruders in the house. My family, my weird family was under attack and I was going to defend them! I spent hours looking around the house, all in the black, because as I found out, the light panel outside of the house was also shot. I had no idea what was happening, but I was honestly furious. I didn't even realize when the sky turned red, due to the rise of the sun. What really startled me was a scream out of the blue.

 I ran out and saw a woman in the road, getting viciously attacked by many shadows? They had the face of an animal, like wolf, body like human but taller.... And they were like they were made by shadows. In mere seconds they devoured the unlucky woman, leaving only the head behind, before turning their attention towards me. I shouted. I told them to not come closer. They lunged. I shot the gun and tripped, bullets flew through them like they weren't there. They got me pinned down and begun hitting me. My God, their teeth, so big, so many, more than any living thing should have. I was for sure goner that moment, if not for the side of the wall that gave up and fall. 

They momentarily left me and I crawled inside the house and with huge pain run and hid under the bed in my Dads bedroom . They all walked around the bed, like waiting for me to get out, but nobody actually pulled me. They begun screeching inhuman sounds, horrible sounds and hitting the walls , but I didn't give up. For some reason, they couldn't get me.

 Like the vampires, that need invitation to come inside your house? What was I supposed to do, invite them under the bed? I sat there dumbfounded for hours, till I fall asleep. When I woke up, I was alone again and it was night outside. I got out of the bed, my body hurt like hell and then I realized, they had destroyed the walls inside the room. I turn around and I was hit and tossed to the other side of the room. They were there! Moonlight was shining through the holes and with every light, I could see one of them, standing in front of me. Light fall under the bed too and in moments one of them appeared below the bed and in moments utterly destroyed it. It was my last defense and they knew it. In that moment I understood everything. 

The DARK. They couldn't enter the dark. Darkness was my only safety. And I had almost run out of it. I crawled in the little corner I was stuck, so not an inch of me exits the safety of the darkness, which was really uncomfortable. And then, we waited. All night they stood in front of me, like statues and watched me. All night I was watching them and praying nobody smashes the wall from the outside. I don't know why they couldn't do that, nor when I was under the bed. I have a theory, that when someone is hiding in the darkness, it sort of work as armor and they can't destroy the shadow spot, as long as there is no light there. 

After sitting on the same spot for almost 8 full hours, my body hurt tremendously. My bowl gave up, on that spot too, but I was surprised it didn't gave up hours ago to be honest. It was a pain full night, that turned into a more painful day. A cloudy day, but instead t of just ten monsters with the moonlight, now were thousands. All there, all waiting. Those were the 30 most painful hours of my life. As soon as night came again, it was a cloudy night too. Clouds prevented moon from shining there,so, darkness was wining. Some higher power was rooting for me.

I saw my chance and crawled out of that house, no longer could move my legs out of so many hours sitting still. I crawled to the little forest beside my house and my neighbors, Mr Flanins house. There are no sounds, not children, not animals, nothing. Its like everything is hiding.... Or everything is dead. I will be soon too. The brief tossing battle with them probably did me a good one. I thought I couldn't move my legs because of sitting. 

Now I can't even feel them. My ribs hurt too much, I am no doctor, but it feels bad too. I haven't eaten or drunk anything for almost two days too. Clouds slowly are giving away and with the light I see more now. Soon it will come for me too. I don't have long now. I see them, but I also see the houses. They are broken, I see guns, I see police vehicles, I even see a tank or two. I don't know if this is because of my deteriorating body and mind, but it seems like a battle happened. Or tried to happen. We lost. I don't know where they came from or why, but I know they came with the light. I hope its not too late for you.... Beware the light!

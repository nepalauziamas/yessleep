I was 6 when i heard this, my grandpa owned a business where he would make knives. Specifically Japanese knives. I had always had a fondness to cooking and items related to the kitchen, so i would often give my grandpa company when he would work shop. 
He had a team of 4, 2 for adding the handles, 1 for sharpening and himself, who did all the above and more. He was always an inspiration to me, and his words stuck with me. He often told me how chefs would come requesting specific knives that felt like they were using their own hands and not another object. My grandpa would always, and i mean always satisfy them. 

As much as i loved observing the details, i failed to notice something. 

This year, i’m 22 and i’m an amateur chef. I’m still learning the arts and i like to go to restaurants where the chef cooks infront of you. 
This time, i was going to “Fushiba’s Sushi”, it was a very famous shop and i was lucky i managed to get a spot. 

As i go in to sit, i see everyone praising the chef for performing tricks and putting on a display for the crowd with only hand. “Wow, must be hard” i thought. I looked over to the other tables, as usual, each one had a crowd of people cheering. Oddly enough, on the table to my left, the chef’s right hand was missing. 

I brushed it off as a coincidence and continued looking around, trying to take in the beauty of this place. When i notice, another table with another’s chef’s arm missing.  Only this time it was the right arm. This peaked my curiosity, which led me to ask the chef at my table “Why are all the chefs here missing an arm?” 

I didn’t get a reply, although he was looking worthily at the knife he was using. I brushed it off  and ate and left.

Now, it’s the next day, and i’m visiting my grandparents who are alive and well. Excited for my visit, i called up my grandma and was spoke about my day yesterday. Her replies were the usual ‘that’s nice sweetie !’ or ‘mhm’ in a cherry voice until i mentioned the strange incident i saw at the restaurant.  Her tone instantly changed to a worried one and i couldn’t figure out why. 

Anyways, i reached their house and said my hellos. honestly i was eager to check out my grandfather’s knife workshop. He was usually a jolly old man who loved to see his grandkids. Only this time something was different. He kept asking me if i wanted a knife because i was a chef now, and kept asking me where i’d be working, mentioning the sushi place i ate in. 

It was all really odd for me, until it hit me, “knives that are extensions of one’s hands” were actually the chefs’ hands.

I was inspired by a video i saw on youtube about Japanese knives.

(!BAD SPELLING!)

I didn't intend to be a stalker. I didn't intend for this to happen. I didn't want this to happen. But she was so gorgeous. Her dark long hair and her hazel eyes was too much for me to comprehend. It started in 8th grade, she wasn't popular and neither was i. We never talked but i always saw her sitting alone in the cafeteria on the same spot everyday. She was always on her phone, she tried acting cool by fake-texting but in reality was she just scrolling on her phone and making some random comments on posts here-and-there. 

She eventually started a summer job in a small ice cream shop near the town center. I sat by one of the benches in the shadow behind a big tree. I just watched her. I didn't want to hurt her in any way possible. But it was just fascinating watching her even though she never did anything out of the ordinary. 

I don't even think she saw me, witch i was okay with. 

I decided to follow her home one night after her job and then i learned where she lived. My intrest grew more and more. I followed her everywhere. Learned her weekly routine and made sure she was safe. She stopped working at the ice cream shop after graduation and applied to a university. I went to another one near. She started work as a waiter in a really big and fancy resturant. Left home and found a great guy who she fell inlove with. Got their own place in a small house close to the woods where they would always go camping. I still watched her. I sat high up in a tree where i could get a good view from the kitchen window. They danced to the music that was playing from the radio. Often baked cookies, cakes and muffins toghter. I could steal one or two if i was brave. They did their daily routine by him going to work in a library and her going to work at the resturant. 

I would take the key under the plant where they hid it and go in the house to take a shower and eat. I slept outside in a tent hidden besides a bush. Then they would both come home, shower, eat, brush their teeth, and then go to bed.

But, i've noticed that she has been been doing something. Something strange. She has been coming home earlier then her boyfriend, she always have two bags with her. Two bags that she usally just uses for trash. She doesn't put them in the trash bin. She insted throws them in the river near the woods they're camping in. Then she  drives away with her car and park it away from the house. When the clock hits 16:00 both him and her drive up to the driveway. After that they both do the daily routine. She's been doing this for one week. She then searches the woods after tossing in the bags. She has gotten a lot of paranoia lately. Always checks windows and wardrobes. It's like she feels like someone is watching her. Maybe she knows i'm here.  




What is she doing...?

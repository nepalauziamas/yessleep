Today I traded my finger with a demon. The deal totally rocks!

Sitting in the security room, a wall of ridiculously crisp and vivid screens read 'no signal.' I tapped the container holding my eye, intrigued by the altered color. I have hazel eyes. Why was this eye bright green now?

I was pulled back to reality as the door burst open, the stout woman smugly staring at me. Her cruel expression caused goosebumps along my arms.

"Hand it over," she ordered, holding out a hand. A minute passed, neither of us moving until she said "I can always remove another eye."

I quickly passed the jar over, flipping her off with both hands. "How about fuck no" I stated, lowering my middle fingers.

"Look mate, I'm just supposed to show you your week and convince you to let us air the footage. Azy will help me convince you if you need convincing."

A shining topaz devil mask poked its head around the door frame, revealing ruby eyes. A fire burned behind the eyes, a fire of pure, unbridled fury. Clenching my cheeks tightly so as to avoid an accident in my pants, I turned into an obedient dog.

The purple devil was terrible. Now there was an orange one? How many of these things are there?

Amid my panic attack, the short lady spoke. "We have footage from your shifts so far. Please review them and sign the waivers for each clip. Higher-ups require written permission to use clips." She waved the topaz devil to the seat beside me, then grinned like the devil masks. "Have fun you two!" She gushed false joy, slamming the door then adjusting about a dozen locks that most certainly were not there earlier.

The orange devil made crunching, grinding noises as its joints bent, as though they were never meant to bend. It sat in the rolling chair beside me, producing terrible gnashing sounds.

I set my eyes on the screens, all too aware of the ruby beads staring at me, unblinking. In a voice both quiet yet more piercing than frostbite, the devil snickered out "the fire isn't real… but the ice…?"

Topaz trailed off as the screens came to life, playing my memories verbatim.

"Boring…" Topaz jeered, snapping a finger… clean off.

I began to gag, revolted by the apparent disregard for their own wellbeing. Then, a mote frightening thought occurred to me. If it snapped its own finger off, what would it do to me?

Topaz left little room to process those thoughts, however. The screens fast forwarded straight to Pauly and me pulling up to the house. The room dropped at least ten degrees, Topaz letting off cold steam.

I wanted nothing more than to run from the demon at that moment, but I found my lower half frozen. Not by fear or something intangibly. From bellybutton down, I was frozen in am orange ice, smooth and colder than anything I'd ever felt.

Topaz reattached the finger, cocking its masked head. "Behave, little one" Topaz ordered, snapping normally and dissolving the orange ice.

I was forced to watch as the hellhounds that attempted to maul Sean whipped their tongues out, from both my perspective and from Pauly's. 

I was forced to watch as they tore me in half, then ripped me from Pauly's arms. Even after I died, the footage from my eyes played on… I'll spare you the graphic details.

I was forced to watch from various points of view threw each other horrible thing I'd experienced, even what that girl saw and the five and a half people locked in the witch's basement. Each screen held a different pair of eyes. It was almost as though the screens has recordings from the eyes, themselves. They blinked and everything.

At the end of the torture session, Topaz snapped off a hand, pulling a scroll from the hollow stump. Unfurling the document, Topaz offered me the dismembered hand. Sure enough, the non finger side had a pen protruding from the gemstone hand. Without even reading the waiver, I signed. I was not going to risk Azy having to convince me after freezing me and ripping their own body apart.

Azy was almost disappointed, accepting the hand and paperwork back. A gut wrenching cracking sound violated my ears as the demonic grin contorted into a frown befitting a sad clown. I would have laughed if I wasn't on the verge of losing control of my bowels.

Despite the fear I felt in that moment, I had too many questions to ask, to simply let Azy walk away. Consequences be damned, I asked a few questions.

"Azy, how many of you… are there?" I gestured at the devil mask, speaking softly, carefully.

"Honey, there are many like me" Azy stated, in a much more casual tone. I snorted, hearing a stereotypical California girl come through the mask.

"What… are you?" I hazarded, squeezing my eyes shut as I anticipated the worst. Instead, the California girl voice continued.

"You mean Mephi? Bastard walks around in corpses. Is he the one who threw that outfit on you?!" Azy chortled, covering the mouth of the mask as though that did anything.

Despite the incredible unease the unnerving creature beside me caused me, I found it in me to go red cheeked in embarrassment. Unable to defend myself, I nodded indignantly.

"Gods, devils, demons, angels, we wear many masks. Regardless of the stories we are known for, who we are is completely different. I was once a Canaanite god, Azazel, until my people were overthrown and I was renamed a devil."

"Whoa whoa whoa wha?" I stammered, surprised beyond the fear and embarrassment. 

"Regardless of the title change, I still wear this same mask. I'm still the same as I always was, with a few hundred goats sacrificed in my name, but I'm still me. Think of me like a manager. Mephi is one too."

"This is batshit…?!" I yelped, a resounding crunch echoing off the walls as I doubled over, holding my middle finger.

"No. Swearing." Azy stated in an empty, monotone voice. Breaking from an apparent trance, Azy sighed sadly.

A crystalline hand clasped my broken finger with vice like grip, crushing with more and more pressure until I thought it would pop, then it happened.

The pain… disappeared.

I looked up, seeing the rubies no longer burning with rage, but instead with a remorseful, pained flame. "What did you just… do?" I asked slowly, unsure of what to do. I broke an unwritten rule and was still punished. Why was I rewarded?

"You may struggle to bend it, but it should get easier over the course of each day." Azy stated, eyes glossed over.

In turn, I observed the rigid digit I now had on my left hand. I could NOT bend it. With my other hand, I tried to bend it, harder and harder, until… guhh… it snapped right off. The same snapping sound as when Azy snapped their finger off came from my own finger, though I felt nothing.

The sound and sight, on the other hand, sent me into shock. I began hyperventilating, holding the severed crystal finger so tight that my palm began to bleed.

"Put it back on," Azy laughed, sending the frown into an open mouthed, sapphire toothed smile.

Arms trembling, I warned with the vomit creeping up my throat. Like a game of operation, my hands shook violently. The detached finger seamlessly and soundlessly joined with the nub.

Azy just burst out into more raucous laughter, even as I nearly fell from my seat in both shock and relief. Then I noticed it. My broken finger… it was on Azy's hand.

"Consider it a get out of jail free card. Stab yourself with it, and I shall save your dumb ass." Azy said slyly, picking at the nail of my stolen finger.

"Wait you just-" I objected, getting cut off.

"We can say whatever the fuck we want. Double standards are lovely, no?"

So I guess I befriended a demon god something?

Anyways, the day ended with Azy showing me how to use the otherworldly finger. It can even make calls, who knew? 4:53pm rolled around, and the purple mask blinked into existence.

A rotting corpse wore the mask, flesh drooping from it. It would have been far more terrifying, had Azy not promptly bopped the purple devil over the head.

With a grunt, Mephi flipped off Azy, turned to me, tapping my shoulder from behind with a third hand. I did not turn to face the other way.

Azy had predicted the move, however they neglected to mention this next part.

"Excellent taste, babe!"

My jaw dropped.

"Awww, thanks bae!" Mephi gushed in an overly flamboyant voice, one that entirely did not match the corpse body. "Where's the eye?" Mephi turned slightly, returning to the hellish voice.

The short woman rounded the corner, saw the two devils, tossed the eye jar to Mephi, and left. Not even the secretaries wanted to screw with literal demons.

I would love to know what happened next, but unfortunately I couldn't tell ya. Mephi said "night night" and the world fell dark.

I woke up at 4:53pm, back at the empty PixiePages parking lot.

I pushed myself to my feet, rubbing my head. I immediately regretted it, however, as the rocky finger grinded against my skull. Yup. Still had it.

As I approached my car, I found a note scratched into my windshield. It read 'Azy's mine, bitch!' -Mephi.

I shrugged, then drove home.

Whoever was in charge of transporting me left one final 'fuck you' when I got home. Where I had laid on my floor, the bloodied boxers retained their shape. A pile of body shaped dirt sat on the floor, as though plucked from my skin and left behind.

Interesting, right? I'm starting to think this teleportation thing has its limitations…

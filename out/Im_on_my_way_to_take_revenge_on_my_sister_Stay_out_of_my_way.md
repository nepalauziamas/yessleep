I saw what my sister wrote about me, in her own guilt-induced confession. She painted me as this helpless little creature, crying and mewling as the handlers took me away, but that’s far from the truth. I know now that my cries were borne from anger. I was cursing her, in the only words I could muster at the time. 

(Here's the confession, in case any of you forgot. 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uzcll9/my\_little\_sister\_is\_very\_angry\_with\_me\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uzcll9/my_little_sister_is_very_angry_with_me_for/))

When I remember those memories, it infuriates me. Knowing all of those moments meant nothing. She gave me away. The rest of my siblings all watched with bug-eyes, as if they didn’t know what was gonna happen. 

My parents were hardly in my life. Esperanza said they had to work, and they supported us, but the Red-Lipped Woman said they wanted me gone, and didn’t want to get attached.

“Why do you think your daddy called us so fast?” she smiled, pinching my cheek. “Ava. Avian. Such similar names, hm?”  

“They made you this way,” she’d add on. “They took a risk that you’d become an abomination, with the express purpose of giving you away.” 

I’d tried to bite her fingers, but she’d taken her hand away too fast, and the Tall Man had then electrocuted me for my insolence, back when his punishments weren’t creative at all. I wondered, if this’d been done to me on purpose, if my siblings would mutate as well. I’d have loved to see them try and survive a day in my life. 

My life was a cycle of waking up, eating from a very specific meal plan that never deviated, education, then training for the rest of the day, before sleeping and waking up to the same cycle over and over again. 

(On the first day, I’d been pushed from a perch and forced to fly.

My sister’s promise was all I could think of.) 

When we trained, it could cover a variety of things. Normally it was sparring or racing against each other in obstacle courses, to strengthen us, but to also put all of us at a distance with each other. Normally, we’d switch up pairings, but I was paired most often with one of the older boys, who was called Flying Fox by our handlers. He was the only other one in the facility with wings (though he also sported a pair of big, misshapen ears), so we frequently had aerial fights. 

If our arena had windows, I knew I could win. If the light was blocked out, I would be in trouble. 

Regardless, I’d do anything within my power to beat him. Scratching, biting, hitting, or even grabbing him, flying up and dropping him, which’d evolved into a specialty of mine. My other specialty was eye gouging, though I was only allowed to practice that on training dummies, thus not damaging any of the handlers’ other little pets. 

Flying Fox was a lot heavier than me, so it’d been nice training for me to get experience fighting people bigger than me. I figured it’d come in handy, seeing as I’m the youngest of my true siblings. 

(The frustrating things about Flying Fox in particular were: 1) due to his wings, he never actually fell when I dropped him, and 2) scratching his eyes out was useless, as they’d been gouged out.) 

There’s a policy in the facility. Whoever loses their training bout is punished. The Tall Man was always in charge of doling out punishment, and he had a binder chock-full of notes on each of us, our weaknesses, and what makes us tick. 

For me, whenever I happened to lose (which happened much more when I was little and Flying Fox still had eyes) I’d be bound up and submerged into water, in a confined, dark pool. My wings would become heavy, and I’d gasp for air as I sank further and my vision swam with spots. The Tall Man liked to wait until I was on the brink of passing out, then pluck me from the water. It was miserable, having wet wings. My back would ache, and some of the skin around my wings would tear and bleed as a result of their increased weight. 

I suppose I should thank the Tall Man. His punishments ensured I grew very strong, very fast. I’d always liked him better than the Red-Lipped Woman. She tried to fake kindness, while the Tall Man was unabashedly cruel. I appreciated the honesty.

The Red-Lipped Woman had helped, though. She’d given me the exercise that’d maintained my passion for revenge. Besides, well, teaching us all reading and writing and stuff.

The Red-Lipped Woman called it ‘positive visualization’. 

“One day,” she said, smiling brightly, “You will graduate from here, and you will fight forever. Do you all want to fight forever?” No one said a word, and the Red-Lipped Woman laughed, and shook her head. “It’s okay, lovelies. Do any of you know why you’re here at all?” 

Limbs, another older kid with stitches woven throughout his body, raised his hand. His finger dangled limply from where his stitch had come loose, and dried blood still matted his skin. It always did. “Our families gave us up. For money.” 

Limbs was one of the kids I hated less. He was honest about how things were, and never complained. In fact, he never raised his voice above a flat monotone, and it was a welcome reprieve from the crying of the little kids, and the grumblings of the older ones. 

“Yes,” the Red-Lipped Woman said, nodding her head. “Can you think back to that moment, Limbs? How did it make you feel?” 

Limbs closed his eyes. “It felt bad, at the time. My father handed me over. My mother couldn’t look.” 

“What did they say to you?” 

“My father couldn’t say goodbye. He said, before you and him got there, that they wanted a good life, and nothing had ever gone his way like this. He just needed a lucky break.” 

“You were his break.” 

Limbs nodded. 

The Red-Lipped Woman turned to the rest of us. “How many of you did this happen to?” 

Every hand in the room went up. The Red-Lipped Woman then showed us pictures of people, obviously taken from afar, living in luxury. It hadn’t clicked to me, at first, until I heard a choked gasp from Limbs as a picture of a middle-aged couple with a new baby standing in front of a large house with a white picket fence, that I knew what was going on. The woman had skin that was dark, like Limbs, and the man had his same eyes. 

Then, a picture of my family popped up. Well, several, actually. I saw Mom and Dad smiling, holding diplomas in their hands as they walked across a stage. 

A picture of Jorge attending science camp, holding a trophy and smiling. Yvette out at the mall with her friends, laden with shopping bags and talking on an expensive phone. Fernando sitting at a lunch table with a bag full of food, in the middle of a conversation.

Then, Esperanza. I saw her, smiling at her first job. It was at a pet store, and she had a canary perched on her finger, as she gave it a fond smile. For a brief moment, I thought her eyes seemed sad. An anger burned in my gut, and I looked again, I realized, her smile must’ve been smug. She’d traded me in for a pet, less mess and extra money to boot. 

That’s how she thought of me. A pet waiting to be sold. The image burned into my brain. 

When I’d visualized my family, and more importantly, Esperanza, smiling and laughing while I bled and fought, I shook with rage. When Esperanza’s promise replayed in my head, I wanted to tear my ears off and scream even louder to drown out the sound of her voice. 

The only way I could calm myself down was to picture my parents, the twins, and Fernando lying broken and battered in the ruins of the nice house. I thought of clawing out eyes, tearing throats, and soaring through the clouds, clutching my eldest sister tight to my chest. We’d fly over the ocean, and I’d think of all the times I’d been submerged in water to nearly drown. Then, I’d do to her what she’d done to me. 

Let her go. 

(I remembered my own promise, the one I’d made, and it drowned out her voice, finally. My own voice echoed in my head. 

*“I hope you’re happy. I promise one day, you won’t be.”* ) 

That made me smile. I noticed some of the others had distant looks, some even sniffled and cried. 

“That is what you all are made for,” the Red-Lipped Woman declared with a serene smile, even directing her gaze to me for a moment. “As a way to get them to the top. They want to never hear from you again. Have they ever written? Or called? Did they stop this? Do you want to prove to them that you can be useful, and become something greater than a mere human?”

A murmuring swept through those of us in the session. I kept silent, not really wanting to talk to the others, seeing as I didn’t trust them in the slightest. Flying Fox was silent as well, though he seemed to be deep in thought. Limbs didn’t say much, and another girl, Twice Tangled, laughed aloud. 

“Mine came,” A boy, who’s name I remembered to be Mouse, asked. Despite his name, he was awfully tall. “I…I remember, on the day before I came here. My parents visited me, and they cried, and said they wanted me back.” 

(The thought of Esperanza visiting me, looking at me with that pitying look, flashed through my head. She’d said “*I’m taking her back.”* 

As if she’d really meant it. She’d already moved on to another little bird anyway. I remembered my promise, and drowned her out.)  

The Red-Lipped Woman had shook her head. “No, Mouse. Your guardians signed the paper, and they took the money. They had a momentary lapse, but they made their choice long ago. They loved you, but they loved their money more. We’re here now, and we will make you into something great.” 

Mouse had begun to cry and sob about how he wanted his real family back. A few of the younger kids began to cry as well, and he’d been swiftly ushered out of his room for a talk with the Tall Man. He didn’t come back. 

“He was too much of a crybaby,” Twice Tangled had said in between bouts of laughter. “Even now, Mouse won’t stop crying and I can still hear him! He won’t stop!” 

“What’d you think about?” Mirage, another one of us, who’d since left (the Tall Man said they’d graduated or something), asked. “I thought of what my old family would say if they saw me fight.”

“Do you think they’ll even remember who we were?” Flying Fox, who still could see back then, asked. 

I had a vision now, one that I’d dedicate my life to making a reality. It’s not like I could do anything else with my life anyway. I’d been designed as a bargaining chip, a soldier, and an abomination. 

I’m not delusional enough to think I could have a normal life, with two giant, golden wings on my back, and talons instead of nails. 

We’d continued the positive visualization, with the Red-Lipped Woman showing us footage of our families, fat and happy. We didn’t have that luxury, but it was okay, because we were fulfilling a greater purpose. We were different. We were better, but they’d been willing to give us away. In the end, the Red-Lipped Woman made a promise that her and the Tall Man would always recognize our brilliance, and they loved us for it. They’d never let us go. 

I believed that part, at least. 

I didn’t give a damn about any made-up purpose, though the Red-Lipped Woman always seemed so happy when I smiled as I’d picture my family dying horribly. 

“Ah, Avian,” she said, clasping her hands together. “Who are you thinking of?” 

I’d always say the same thing. “Fulfilling my purpose.” 

Strangely enough, she only smiled more. “Wonderful, my darling. I knew you’d catch on quick.” 

My escape plan, which’d always been an abstract, yet burning want at the back of my mind, was fueled by my visualizations. The actual plan materialized half a year later, when Flying Fox lost his eyes. It occurred after the positive visualization was implemented. 

He’d grown increasingly panicked and disgruntled, despite his standing as one of the oldest and strongest. He’d broken out one night, and made like a bat out of hell into the outside. He’d had a muzzle strapped to his face that night too, as punishment for losing an aerial battle to me, but he’d pressed on. 

The Tall Man and Red-Lipped Woman seemed unusually calm about the whole thing at first. In fact, they had a good laugh over it, telling the rest of us that Flying Fox had failed something they coined as a ‘loyalty test’. 

It wasn’t until they realized he’d crossed state lines overnight (they’d apparently put a tracker in his muzzle) that they began to mobilize to bring him in. Then, according to Limbs, who’d been in punishment that day, the Red-Lipped Woman had burst in, panicked, declaring that the tracking signal had gone dead. 

The facility had gone into lockdown mode for weeks, with the Tall Man leaving with a small army of men, while the Red-Lipped Woman and the orderlies stayed with us. It was hilarious, to see how forced her smiles were, and how she seemed seconds away from dropping the motherly act. She never quite got there, but even the little kids began to shy away from her at times, when her voice, still sweet, came with a clipped and angry edge. 

Twice Tangled had grown manic by that time, laughing and howling about how she couldn’t wait to play with her new friend soon, and the Red-Lipped Woman, instead of talking to her in her soft voice to calm her, had lost her patience. We’d been ushered out of the room, except for a little boy who’d been too frightened to move. After some yelling and screaming, Twice Tangled was dragged away, sedated. 

The rest of us were glad for it. Though, I felt a lump of dread linger in my throat when I noticed the little boy was still unaccounted for. 

Twice Tangled was the oldest of us. She’d always had a habit of muttering to herself, and for her training, she’d never been allowed to fight the rest of us, instead being thrown into the ring with various transients that the handlers had no doubt plucked off the street to be her playthings. I can still remember my first time hearing the screams of a transient man echoing throughout the entire facility for hours, when I was nine, and Twice Tangled was still around, always smiling and never allowed to touch anyone. 

She’d been the only one to ever really scare me. I hoped, from the bottom of my heart, that she was put down or something. I had no idea what she was. Or why she always knew about where all the others who’d gone before her. 

There were several weak kids that I knew would be moved away to make room for those with potential, but Twice Tangled was different. She had just been too strong but too unstable to fully control. 

A few days later, Flying Fox was dragged in, muzzled, blindfolded, and bound in netting. That’s when the Tall Man had brought out a spoon, and forced him to his knees, while Flying Fox whined and cried, bucking desperately in his grip. 

“This,” the Tall Man said, brandishing the spoon, “Is what happens to those who lose sight of their purpose.” 

Then, he’d lifted the blindfold, barely giving Flying Fox time to open his eyes before he dug in, scooping out Flying Fox’s eyes with a spoon while multiple other men held him in place. His screams were muted by the muzzle, but I could tell, by the manic look in his eye and the bloody tears he’d shed in the final moments of seeing, that he’d felt more pain in that moment than I’d ever felt in my worst punishment. 

For a brief moment, I’d wanted to cry too, but I pushed it down. I forced myself to stop trembling, though my legs still threatened to give out as I watched the painstaking process. I wasn’t a weak little kid, and crying was showing weakness. When I made my escape, I would not be weak. 

After a year of Flying Fox healing, then being paraded around as an example, it seemed like things had settled, but I was hardly satisfied. He’d gotten out, and I needed to know how. I didn’t give a damn about asking about if his eyes or the scars around his mouth hurt, like the little kids did. 

I’d found him by the pool, which was one of my least favorite places in the world, but I was willing to suck it up this time. Flying Fox was with one of the weaker kids, a nine year-old girl with sickly yellow, amphibious eyes and disgustingly oily and patchy skin. He was easing her into the water, being very careful not to touch her skin. 

(I remember now that she secreted a sort of toxin or something. Truthfully, I’d never paid her much mind.

I guess that’d been an oversight on my part.) 

Flying Fox clicked his tongue, and he faced me with his eyeless sockets. He’d done the tongue clicking before, but it’d grown excessive after the incident. “What do you need, Avian?” 

“Why’d you leave?” I asked. 

Flying Fox sighed, and gently led the girl to the wall. I’d never bothered to learn what the handlers called her. “Take a break, Tadpole,” he’d said to the girl (I knew that wasn’t her name, it was too kind) and she’d nodded, though she looked at me with curious eyes. 

“Did you find your family?” the little girl mumbled, treading water. Her voice was all whiney and sickly, and listening to it made me cringe with disgust. 

“Well, that was the reason I left.” He stopped, clicking his tongue again and looking around. He rubbed his jaw. “That’s all I’ll say on that.” 

His voice was a near whisper, and he looked so scared, which I thought was pathetic. He was so much older than me, but he was the one who looked like a little, scared kid. “You need to tell me,” I whispered slowly. “How’d you get out? Which corridors did you use and-”  

“Do you enjoy seeing?” Flying Fox asked, scarred sockets fixed on me. “Or…no, your sight is an asset to you. You need it to fight. I was already legally blind…well, you don’t need legs to fly. Do you…do you enjoy walking, Avian?” 

I thought of the image of my family’s bloody and broken bodies. “Sure, but I’d be willing to go without it.” 

“Stay put. If you leave, you’ll get everyone hurt,” he muttered, though he repeated the last bit to himself again, and he seemed close to tears. 

The little girl shifted closer to him and patted his arm with a gloved hand. “Don’t cry.” 

“He can’t,” I corrected, rolling my eyes at her. 

“You don’t want this,” he warned. “If they find you, you’ll be tortured and hurt, and they’ll kill anyone you meet along the way.” 

I smiled, knowing he couldn’t see. “That’s fine with me.” 

“There are kind people out there,” Flying Fox countered, his voice wavering. “Some that don’t deserve to be caught up in whatever identity crisis you’re having.” 

“Identity crisis, hm?” I perched near the edge of the pool, leering at him. 

The little amphibian spat water at me, which caused me to leap back, cursing and fighting back the involuntary revulsion that water gave me. 

“I needed to know if they ever regretted giving me up,” Flying Fox said. “I needed to know if what she says about the outside not being for us is true.” 

“I-is it?” the little amphibian asked, her voice hesitant but hopeful. 

“I never got to my parents,” Flying Fox said, clicking his tongue, and then pointing to his jaw. “I went North and saw the stars-”

“The stars?” the little girl gasped aloud. 

Flying Fox nodded. “They were like tiny fairies napping in the sky, and when I reached up, it was like I could hold them in my hands…though that wasn’t the most beautiful thing I saw.”

Flying Fox seemed to open up, though that was by virtue of his little audience member, and for that, I suppose she wasn’t entirely useless. If it were only me, I don’t think he would’ve been so easily persuaded. 

(We’d never seen eye to eye.)

“What was it?” the little girl asked, and I tapped my hand impatiently. 

“A person,” Flying Fox murmured, in a strangely mournful voice. “He was the brightest thing I’d ever seen in my entire life. He helped me out of my muzzle, and showed me that the outside could…it could be kind to things made like us. The last thing I saw was his home being burnt to the ground. I could smell people burning inside.” 

“Oh,” the little girl muttered, dejected. 

I pictured my own family cooking and charring, and I found that I was partial to that image, though I’d obviously want more of a hand in it, in an ideal situation. Plus, unlike Flying Fox, I didn’t care about meeting other civilians. Or, well, the consequences of them seeing me. 

“I need to know for myself,” I lied, trying to appeal to him. Making my voice sound all wistful was hard. “I need to see my family. I’ve always loved them, and I need to know if they love me too. I’ve tried to sleep for so many nights, but I can’t stop thinking about it.” 

“You really wanna?” the little girl said, tilting her head. 

Flying Fox sighed, and I’m sure if he had eyes, he would’ve rolled them. “You’re a shitty liar, Avian. It doesn’t suit you…but I’ll tell you what I did. I think you’ll find a way to get out even if I didn’t, and it’d be nice if someone succeeded. It might as well be you. You’ve got the mind for it.” 

I bit my lip. “What do you mean by that?” 

Flying Fox gave me a wry smile. “You’re determined and mean. It’s just what you need to escape and stay gone.” 

I smiled. “Thanks.” 

Flying Fox sighed. “Just…promise me something. If you somehow meet a guy named-” He paused. “Nevermind. He’s probably gone…and I wouldn’t trust you not to kill him. I don’t think a promise would mean anything to you.” 

I nearly laughed at that last statement, but I wisely held it in. I didn’t want to promise him anything, because then, I’d actually feel inclined to keep it. Promises were something special, and I never made them with any of the others for a reason, keeping them at a distance. 

(Some promised to go easy on training, or swap food, but it’d always end in punishment anyway.) 

Flying Fox then shooed me away as an orderly came to check on us, and I had to force myself to practice swimming to not appear suspicious, even if the feeling of water around me made me want to vomit. It was humiliating, to be outperformed in practice laps by Flying Fox, and the sickly girl, who surprisingly, cut through the water easily despite a slow pace. 

I was punished later on by the Tall Man, but I hardly even registered it. I took my brain to another place, picturing flying out in the open, hurtling towards my family’s perfect house and perfect life like a golden wrecking ball. 

“Will you falter in your purpose again?” The Tall Man asked.

“No,” I replied, absolutely certain. 

“I figured as much,” the Tall Man replied. “You’ve always had a fight in you.” 

Later that night, Flying Fox told me about how his room door was left unlocked (our rooms were more small compartments than rooms), and he’d crept down our outermost corridor before sneaking past a few orderlies standing guard, and using one of their key cards that he pickpocketed to open the back doors. Then, he’d flown silently over the gate, blending in with the dark, and subsequently hitching a ride atop the nearest bus and going out of state, and up North where his family was. 

From his description, the setup seemed very, very easy. That’s when it dawned on me that he’d been set up to escape. As a test. A loyalty test, that he’d failed readily, then proceeded to actually nearly escape for real. I didn’t tell him that, though. I didn’t really care enough to. The route was still viable, and no one had done much of anything in the realm of escaping after the Flying Fox display had cowed everyone into quiet submission. 

I decided I needed to do what he did, but with a few added steps. A few nights later, after I was confident Flying Fox wasn’t telling on me, I decided to act out my plan. When an orderly came to lock up my room, I pounced on them. I’d been training for years on my speed and reflexes. 

I clawed at their face, swiping and removing their features as if they were made of tissue paper, and they barely uttered a gurgle as they fell. I got to gouge out an eye, which for some reason, made me ill. I guess imagining myself in place of the Tall Man was a bitter pill to swallow, if only because I hated him. I unclipped their keycard and clutched the bloody piece of plastic in my hand as I padded down the hall. 

The advantage of living in the facility was that our rooms were always spaced out. They didn’t want us to talk in the night, which now, worked out well, as there was no one in sight as I dragged the orderly into my room and left them there to bleed and die. 

(Those faceless, spineless weasels dressed in all white sat back and aided in our suffering for a paycheck. I wanted to kill them all, but that would’ve been awfully time consuming, and as you all know, I have other priorities.) 

I crept down the hallway, careful to avoid detection. It was hard. Gigantic, golden wings hindered my every move. Still, I did it, because I have been training for years, breaking my skin and my bones and learning not to cry at all. 

I swiped the keycard, as my heart hammered in my chest. I nearly laughed with glee as the cool, crisp night air danced along my skin, but I knew this would not be the time for celebration. I had to fly over the gate, but my wings were bright and big and gold, while Flying Fox’s were dark as night. 

When it was nighttime, he’d always have the advantage. I cursed in my head, but I still readied my wings. I’d be fast enough to scale the wall and escape. It wasn’t the same facility from when I was six, and Esperanza was visiting me out of misguided pity and to assuage her own conscience. Or just to rub it in that she was free. 

This facility had no iron bars, or surrounding dome. It just had a gigantic wall, lined with barbed wire and electric fencing near the top, creating a somewhat curved in effect.

I soared along the wall, silent, yet nearly glowing in the dark thanks to my wings. I heard a yell, as a light was approaching me, but suddenly, the light went out as soon as it appeared, and I flew, not once looking back to see what happened.

I flew until my back threatened to burst aflame and I could feel the blood trickling down my skin. I decided to take a page from Flying Fox’s playbook, and decided to hitch a ride on top of the closest bus I could find, one that would be heading west, according to a map I’d found nearby. 

My family lived west. I knew that from the street signs in photos and the oceans in the backgrounds, and how it was always sunny in every photo. I knew the West was where the warmth was, and the North was cold. 

I clung to the top of the bus as it prepared to leave with the civilians already inside. My talons were still slippery with blood, but that was trivial to me. I’d hang on for months if that’s what it took. The bus arrived at its final destination, a place warm and humid, as the sun just started to peak over the horizon. 

I quickly flew off into a wooded area near the stop after that, avoiding being seen. It wasn’t like I cared about that sort of thing. I just didn’t want a whole spectacle. 

I spent a few days recuperating, living off greenery and sleeping in trees. I then continued to fly westward, letting my sense of direction guide me, along with a few maps. I knew that the facility was very far from West.

It was odd, to feel the warm, gentle breeze on me as I slept, and to hear the sounds of nature in real time. I’d even looked at the stars, having forgotten what they looked like. 

(Esperanza had let us all go out into the backyard one night when I was four, back when everyone thought I was a lost cause, a poor dying thing, because I’d managed to survive another year, and that’s all she could think to do in celebration. 

I remembered everyone smiling at me, despite the fact that their stomachs growled and they were tired. I think they'd been hoping I’d die soon.  For more room on the bed and more food and just so that things would be better, because for some reason, me going away forever would make everything better. 

When I was little and stupid, that used to make me cry, and Esperanza used to wipe my tears and say she was glad I was there with her. Unlike me, she’s a great liar.) 

The stars, anyhow, weren’t nearly as wonderful as Flying Fox had described them. They were just little holes of light that helped me see where I was going in the night. They were more helpful than pretty. 

I would’ve continued on my own, with no issue, but I ran into familiar faces. Well, two of them. 

I was further West, in a state that I believe was in a geographical area known as ‘Midwest.’ I’d found geography to be boring, though I thanked my mutated senses, as I seemed to have this sort of natural pull towards the warmth. 

Well, anyway, I’d been continuing to stick to rustic, unpopulated areas as I traveled, or I’d fly so high I’d be a speck to those on the ground. 

One night, I stopped to rest in an empty field, for a few hours. That’s when I felt the silky feeling of stitches rub up against my skin. I jolted up with an abrupt flash, and tore at the offending arm without a second thought, detaching it from its owner as a spray of blood dashed my cheek. 

I found myself face to face with Limbs, who looked down at his arm with mild annoyance. 

“You’re going to make me involve the kid,” he said with a sigh, picking up his arm, and a sewing needle.  

Then, the little girl from the pool, who’d been crouching low in the tall grass, leapt up. She’d gotten an impressive height, though she seemed tired still, as she was slow, and I could dodge her. 

Her features were still sweaty and pallid, and despite her little, shaky frame, I didn’t feel bad for her. She wore a full jumpsuit, minus her hands, which were ungloved. Limbs had on a pair of shorts, and that was it. I, for one, only had jumpsuit pants and bandages wrapped around my chest, as my wings made shirts a luxury I couldn’t afford. 

“You’ve gotta come back,” the girl whined, rearing up for another jump. “Or we’ll get in trouble.” 

“If you haven’t already realized,” Limbs said to the girl with a sigh, “The Avian has never cared about what happens to the rest of us.” 

“As if you cared either,” I snarled, rearing up for a fight. 

My talons glistened in the moonlight, and I knew this would be an easy fight. I’d take apart Limbs and the girl…well…I had an idea for her. She shrank back, crying about how she didn’t want to do this anymore. 

Limbs shook his head. “You’re going to have to, or you’ll end up like Fox.” 

The little girl began to cry. 

Limbs sighed, before swiping at me. I flew above him, and swooped away as he lunged, catching him with another swipe, loosening the stitches on his left leg. We repeated the same song and dance, as he’d attempt to get at me, only for me to fly away. His blood stained the grass, though he didn’t seem to care when I got a hit in. 

It wasn’t until he managed to grab my wing, for a brief moment, that trouble arose. It’d been easy to shake him off and fling him aside, but in that moment, I’d been distracted, and the little girl jumped at me. She latched onto my torso with slick, oily fingers, and as soon as she touched me, I lurched as my vision danced and I began to burn up. 

I became enraged, as I glanced at her apologetic face as she clung to me. 

Limbs had the gall to laugh. “I knew you could do it, IntoxiKate. Just like that.” 

I was determined that these two would not beat me, and I could not be stopped now, when I was growing ever closer to fulfilling my purpose. I grabbed onto her jumpsuit, and I took flight, soaring into the air with her clinging to me. 

I ripped her from me, despite her sliminess, and held her in my talons. I could feel them pierce her jumpsuit, as she whimpered from the sensation. 

“Please,” she cried,.“They told us to.” 

I held her out in an extended grip, so she’d dangle at the edge of my talons. She began to wail as I flew higher. 

“They said this was our test,” she wailed. “It’s…we’re supposed to bring you back, or we’re gonna get punished for failing! I’m sorry! Please, just come back! I don’t wanna get hurt!” 

I thought of how the spotlight on me had vanished too quickly. They’d let me go, but for the sake of everyone else. I suppose I should’ve seen that coming, but well, heat of the moment. I also noticed a red glow on the back of the IntoxiKate’s (I suppose the reason I forgot her name was because of how stupid it was) neck, and I swore. They were tracking them, and now, they had my location. 

I had to act fast, and so I did. I dropped her, flinging her to the Earth without a second thought as she screamed. She extended her sticky limbs, as if to try and save herself, but she was falling too far, too fast, and she’d always been sickly, frail and never fully immune to her own toxins. 

She hit the ground with a resounding crunch, and her crying ceased. 

I flew back to Limbs, who’d made remarkable progress on reattaching himself. “You just fell for an obvious trap,” he sighed. “By killing her, they now definitely know where you are. Her signal goes dead, and who else could’ve done it? Amateur move, Avian.” 

I spat at him, and he rolled his eyes. “You’re next.” 

“Well, I’ll fight back, and well, I don’t think you have that sort of time to waste right now,” Limbs gave me a serious look. “Don’t you feel woozy? Hot? You’ve been poisoned, Avian, and you need a doctor soon.” 

I glowered, remaining upright, and I forced myself to ignore the way the world seemed to move and sway as I sweat. I glowered at the broken body of IntoxiKate. I hated her, for her weakness, and her cowardice, and how she’d actually managed to hurt me despite it. 

“I’ll just go faster,” I said, determined, and advanced towards him. “I’ll beat you easily.” 

Limbs laughed, and it was strange to see him smile. “Me? Oh, no. We were just the first group. They’re going to be sending their best out soon, well, actually, considering the signal went dead, I’d say very, very soon.” 

I swore, and extended my wings. I’d nearly taken off when Limbs called out after me. 

“They’re sending Flying Fox and Twice Tangled. He’s going to fight you in the sky, and she’s going to finish you off on the ground,” Limbs shook his head, and his eyes looked vacant. “Whatever you wanted to do out here, Avian, you better do it fast. You don’t have much longer…and for your sake…I hope the poison works fast.” 

I took off, trying in vain to fight off the new round of visions that overtook my brain. My sickly, overloaded brain. I thought of Flying Fox, soaring through the night, and capturing me, because when it’s night, he always wins. 

He’d be mad, once he sees what I did to IntoxiKate. He’d always been one of the nicer kids. 

I don’t think he’d kill me. Twice Tangled…I didn’t know what happened to those she touched, but here she was, being let off her leash to chase me. I’d clearly made enough trouble that eliminating me was now an option, despite my strength. I didn’t want to ever see her face, or hear her laugh, and I wondered what would happen once she got her hands on me. 

I’d never screamed or cried, not in years, but I’d heard the sounds the transients made. They were an assault on the ears, and I worried. I couldn’t let that happen. 

I didn’t think it was possible for me to feel fear about death. I’d only ever thought of revenge and hurt, but I’d never considered myself. For a startling moment, I wanted to curl up and die, and let the poison do its work in peace, and I could die somewhere nice and quiet, like in a bed of flowers, or in a nice tree. 

In this rare moment of weakness and dread, I’d flown for a while, my eyes burning. Then, I found a little bus stop, and there’d been a man sitting alone with a briefcase, as music played from his phone. 

I’d never been allowed to listen to music before, and it made me want to sit and rest, to close my eyes and let the calming melody wash over me. I crept closer to him, and then, he saw me. 

He screamed, and though there was no one around, I still panicked. In that moment, my body moved on its own, as he yelled that I was a creature of sin. He swatted his briefcase at me, and I knocked it aside, and tore at his throat. 

It was then that I picked up his phone, and I tapped at it. It opened to a forum, and I saw a headline that caught my eye. 

My little sister is very angry with me for breaking my promise to her.

I read it, and as I did, I seethed as I realized that this was a confession, years old, from Esperanza. She described me as this helpless little thing. It was infuriating, also, how she described my siblings. As if they really cared about me, after she’d visited that day, with their apparent new wealth and resources. 

Of course, I’d seen them for myself, all happy and smiling in their new lives. They’d never cared about me at all, and Esperanza, Esperanza was *lying* again, and random civilians were eating it up. 

That soft song played as I read comments telling my sister that it wasn’t her responsibility. That she was just a kid. I did see that some hated my parents, and that, well, that felt good to read. For people I knew so little about, I guess I’d forgotten about how much they’d impacted my life. 

For a moment, I almost hated them more than Esperanza, but then, I saw the suggestions that Esperanza break me free. I laughed aloud, though my eyes burned. 

As if someone as feeble as her could break into the facility, or even lift a finger to fight my handlers. She’d hardly been able to look at me without a quiet pity for years, waiting for me to die because she was just like the others, but worse. She’d known I was destined to die and rot, either by the fictitious cancer I’d been told I had despite no medical help, or once she saw me cuffed and led away in our own home. 

She’d done nothing. 

It felt worse with her, because she’d smiled at me, and promised me it would be okay, for so many years. She promised and smiled in my face and then went back and *lied.* 

It was then I came to terms with my inevitable death, either at the hands of my poisoner, or in the grip of Twice Tangled. I’d be content to die, as long as I could live long enough to see my sister suffer. 

So, I gripped the phone tightly in my hands, and began to type out a response of my own. I wanted those people, those spineless little weasels who tried to soothe my sister’s conscience, to hear about what I went through. 

I want you all to know about the others too. 

About Flying Fox, Limbs, IntoxiKate, Twice Tangled, and even Mouse. I don’t care about them, but I wanted you all to know about them, so that when you side with my sister, you side with all the families who gave them up, and let their kids have their eyes scooped out.

I have one purpose now, and that’s to fulfill my promise. I’ll make sure she’s never happy again. I’ll die with the last vision dancing in front of me will be her teary face, as I hold her in my arms and soar towards the ocean as she screams. 

If we both fall in, I’d be okay with that too. 

The Tall Man and Red-Lipped Woman have, no doubt, seen this by now. They’re both very efficient. I know they’ve kept tabs on my family, and thus know where I’m going. 

Honestly, I think they’ve always known what I’ve wanted. To them, I say that I’ll fly faster than you. I’ll make it, before you can send in your attack dogs, and that I already beat two of them. I won’t hesitate to kill Flying Fox or Twice Tangled. I’ll tear Limbs apart as much as I need to, if that’s what it takes. 

I won’t lose. 

As for you civilians reading this, I bet you all think I’m a monster, for my purpose being wrapped up in the suffering of others, for killing IntoxiKate without hesitation, when she was just a kid. 

Well, I was just a kid too. 

This is a warning. I’m going to find my big sister, and if you all know what’s good for you, you’ll stay out of my way. 

I won’t be as generous as Flying Fox, and kill you indirectly and then cry about it afterwards. 

If you try to stop me, or gawk at me like a roadside attraction, or curse me for my body, I will kill you myself. Without hesitation and without remorse. 

At least I’m honest enough to admit that. I’m a monster, not a liar.

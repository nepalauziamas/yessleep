"Come here girl" the same line I used to tell my dog to greet me home after a long day of school. That same comforting and warn line, suddenly became one I disdained as I heard my voice from the attic calling out "Come here girl".

 I've never been the one that believes in the supernatural and unexplained, so I just thought it was someone near our house that had a similar voice and payed no mind to it afterwards. Until my roommate asked me why I was playing with Bella at in the middle of the night, I froze. "It wasn't a dream it was real, it had to make sense by the law of something right"? I kept muttering as my roommate told me to forget it and everything would be alright. God, I wish he was right.

The days after that I couldn't sleep, I lost my appetite and skipped all of my classes. All I could do was rationalize the situation. It stopped calling out my dog as it started to copy my muttering. I could tell it was my voice but something was just off about it. Sometimes it was exactly the same, others it was in slow motion and sometimes even in different octaves. But it always did do something, it always laughed after mimicking me, it's laugh sounded like a twisted version of me crying. 

Today the voice stopped and it told me something, it didn't taunt me or torture me, it just told me to come closer. It took my voice again and repeated "Don't be afraid champ, come here." It kept saying it over and over again, but this time it sounded inviting, it made me calm so I finally unlocked the door and climbed up. What I saw chilled me to my core.

Standing before me was this creature that vaguely resembled a human, I could tell it wasn't only mimicking me but also trying to become me. It had my body size and skin color right to the bone but its flesh did not shift yet. It had open flesh wounds all over its body, it looked very malnourished but the most horrifying was its neck. The neck wasn't like any human or mammal neck, it had gills. As I stood there in shock, it opened its mouth and the gills flapped and moved as it said "Come here, good girl".

I left running and didn't look back, I left all my stuff and dropped out of college. I've never heard it since and have had a pretty good life after that, got married and had sa beautiful baby girl. I had completely forgotten about that thing until today at breakfast my daughter asked me "Daddy, why did you talk so funny at night" I was confused at first until it hit me. That thing has found me and it has come to finish its job. 

Its now on the other side of this door. I'm writing this with tears in my eyes, alone locked it my bathroom. The knocking has turned to pounding, I'm scared and terrified.

I beg you, If you ever hear your own voice, pray as it has sure as hell has heard you.

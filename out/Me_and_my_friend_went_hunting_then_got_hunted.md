  Down deep in the mountains on one late summer day, me and my friend had decided to go hunt ginseng. The plan was to leave first thing on a Saturday morning. We had both grew up in these mountains together are whole life’s. He was 17 I was 18 at this time. My family owned a huge farm threw the mountain which of course ran into other mountains we did not own. That’s where we’d be heading, unarmed just with a few tools and bags for ginseng. 

   My home was armed to the Gils but I never would pack a gun with me and him, only because We done this before so many times with no problems. Besides we know are way around things quite a lot better than most. Not trying be cocky and to run up and down mountains was no more than running flat land to normal people for me and him at that time. So we pretty much just never worried about it. 

   This Saturday I ride my fourwheeler over and pick him up. Will call him Stan for this. Once me and Stan got back down on the side of mountain things were going great we found two or three ginseng plants almost immediately. Are hunt continued on down the bottom of this mountain. Going west on the east sitting side of it for probably about 3 miles. When all sudden at bottom a little creek bed dirt dead end road for a razor, was right beside us. Then long behold I look and there are two razors sitting there back to back. So I shout quietly as possible at Stan keeping my cool and said “stannnnnnnnnn shhhhhhhhh” he doesn’t hear me. 
   
   Finally I hear about 4 men and one woman start to mutter where these razors sit. Stan heard this and slides down the hill to me and says “ Wayne you hear that” in a whispering tone. I said “ yeah just don’t worry about it keep walking.” We both knew this could be bad news. We calmly continued on for about 3 miles. Hell killed two gaint snakes with sticks, found some more ginseng it was a great day. 
   

   On the way back taking the same trail. I begin to get goose bumps all over as it was now about 930 at night. So I look to Stan who probably haddnt thought about I was gonna take us right back by that spot we’d past earlier. I say “ Stan let’s go a little faster.” So we did we are going up and down over and under threw this deer trail, at a pace of a slow jog. 

   As we get probably 500 meters away from where this dead end road across creek was you hear one of the razors are still sitting there and it’s turnt on we only can hear it not see it. I tell Stan stop don’t move. He catches on to what’s going I’m looking straight ahead towards the noise at bottom of this valley we are in. The creek below us a few yards away was at point where he mountains forked 3 different ways. In the middle of that fork sit a patch of creek rock and bottom the creek wasn’t running over making it easy to cross. 

   Stan suddenly in a scared voice seconds after I told him to stop, says”Wayne look” and points right arm past my shoulder and I see it clear as day. 3 men crossing this little creek all armed two had guns one had a axe, all of them were wearing coveralls and had on animal masks. Then just standing with menacing stare was a woman wearing what appeared to be white dress with long black hair, wearing a white masquerade looking mask holding a knife just standing. I seen this for about a two second look I tell Stan “RUN”. 


   We take off hauling ass up this mountain, no longer taking the deer path we’d been on around the bottom. We just take a straight line up. As I run Im filled with goosebumps all over you can hear them muttering talk and making noises things they run across breaking on the ground after us. Then we hit a point we are at about 7 feet cliff wall. I jump up it pull myself up and look at Stan try it. As I hear them all still coming now about 100 yards and closing. He can’t get up. So I jump back down and push his ass up there. As I do his foot knocked a double fist size rock down that hit me square in the head. I almost got knocked out but I was so fool of goosebumps I just jumped my ass back up it. They got so close at that point you could feel there movements. 

   We run about 100 yards more up then hit the main farm road in the mountain. Stan tells me, we made it when we hit the farm road. It was relieve knowing they couldn’t make it out as a we had be trespassing on there side of the creek although we never was, it’s like they knew they couldn’t risk evidence on are family’s farm road. 
   

   What happens next still chills me. They stopped chasing but from about 100 yards away or so that woman shrieked so loud you’d heard it for miles. Still don’t know exactly what pact that was, and for that they probably can be at ease, they know they would not be happy if I was to find em out. What’s funny I probably know them. I still go ginsenging now but I take a gun.

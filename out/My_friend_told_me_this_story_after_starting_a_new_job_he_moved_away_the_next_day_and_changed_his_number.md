7pm, im finishing off my third ever shift at my new job the usual silence somehow loudly echos around the
hallways of the cold school. As i walk past the lockers i hear a few slam around the corner, just the usual night
this happens all the time not something weird for me. i walk over towards that direction as i hear some heavy
breathing. 'What the fuck' i think to myself, im the only person in this building. I just carry on mopping and
continue walking in that direction. once i reach the area where the noises were coming from nothings there. i
brush it off as it was just nothing and reach for my phone to change the song playing through my airpods,
"where is my phone?" i reach into my one pocket and its not there. i think back and think i may have left it in the
principals office on his desk when i was cleaning in there. i walk back, since im new to this job its not hard
for me to get lost in this school also because its so large. 

i wonder the halls and start to hear a thunderstorm outside, which eventually cuts off the power. great, im lost in a school with no flashlight. With
it almost being pitch black i still continue to wonder the halls, i crash into the wall and hear voices echoing in a
nearby room, my shift is supposed to be over at this point. the voices i hear start to get louder as i wonder
closer to one direction, is that the principal i hear? 

he shouldâ€™ve left by now. in the distance i see a small light
coming from a room, its his office. maybe i should just walk in and ask for my phone?? good idea. not. i step closer to the door and hear many men talking in low quiet voices speaking a foreign language, i almost open
the door when i think to look inside the small window and see the desk moved to the corner of the room and
the rug that's usually on the floor lifted up to reveal a pentagram carved into the wooden floor, one person at
each point of the pentagram, there, mr gaultine, the principal. what the fuck. in the centre of the pentagram i see a photo of a person, i immediately recognise the face, i cant make out who it is since i can only see the room because if the dimly lit candles. one of my airpods drops onto the floor and the noise echos, i drop as fast as i can to the floor and the last thing i remember from that night is waking up tied to a chair with them crowding around me speaking that same language. 

the next day i didnt show up for my shift and received a phone call from a random number and hearing one of the men i heard that night offering a large amount of cash for me to keep my job and stay quiet. 

what the
fuck.


thats basically what he told me, so what is this shit??

**TW: sexual assault, self-harm**

Grandpa found me the next morning. I told him I’d been beaten by an “intruder.” When two detectives arrived – both men, of course – I intended to be similarly circumspect, but eventually I broke down and told them everything. 

Two forensics specialists followed. I lay on my back on one of the beds, covered in a white sheet, legs spread in a de-humanizing way as they examined me. I completely understood why people didn’t report things like this. I’d done everything right, everything they say you’re supposed to do, and it just felt like unrelenting violation. I wondered what I’d done to deserve everything that had happened to me since I’d arrived at that cursed house.

“Gimme a cotton swab,” I heard one of the forensics guys say. They were aided in their efforts by a bright, plug-in light. 

I stared straight up at the ceiling, trying to think of nothing at all.

Suddenly, I had an odd sensation, just for a flash. It was as if one of the ghosts – I thought of them as that now, no more ambiguity – superimposed itself over me, like an effect in a photograph. I was pretty sure it was one of the young women from my bed. She was in a similar position to me, except instead of being examined, she was giving birth. It felt almost like I was experiencing the birth along with her, just for that brief moment.

After the examination, I was finally allowed to shower. And that was when all the memories and sensations from the previous night came flooding back. That disgusting, revolting man doing what he pleased with me. I sank down to a seated position in the bathtub, hugged my knees to my chest, and cried.

Later, I stepped out of the shower and grabbed a towel. My eyes gravitated towards the mirror, where someone had written something in the steam again. It was just a set of numbers this time: 

301080

I’d had enough. Earlier, I’d been curious about who had wanted me to find the key to the storage room, but I didn’t care anymore. I was sick of the riddles, the teases, the gaslighting. I was done with that goddamned house. With a shriek of anger, I balled my hand into a fist and punched the mirror, hard. It shattered into pieces.

I stood there, breathing heavily, then noticed that my hand was bleeding. Well, that had accomplished nothing. I pulled off a long sheet of toilet paper and wrapped it around my hand. Then I knelt down to pick up the mirror shards.

I overheard low, murmuring voices, then looked beside me, and realized they were coming from an air vent. I could hear Grandpa and the lead detective talking, all the way from the ground floor.

“Lesions on the labia and contusions on other parts of the body are certainly consistent with forced penetration,” the detective was saying. “No semen, though.”

“What if he used a condom?” Grandpa asked.

“She claims he didn’t,” the detective replied. “Bruno. She says it was a ghost. She says she was raped by a ghost. And that's why he didn't leave any traces.”

“She's a sick girl,” Grandpa said, sadly. 

“How sick? Because listen, you're out here in the middle of nowhere. There's no one else around for miles. There was no sign of forced entry into the house. The doors were locked, all the windows were intact. So I think we have to consider the possibility that she might have done this to herself.”

“No,” Grandpa said. “She wouldn't do that. It doesn't make sense.”

There was a long silence. I could sense the uneasiness even from two stories up.

“Then you realize there's another possibility we have to consider. Just to cover all the bases.”

“What other possibility?” Grandpa asked.

“There are only two people living in this house, Bruno.”

I suddenly realized where the detective was going with this. He was going to arrest Grandpa for what Mark Sheldon had done to me! I couldn’t allow that to happen. I scrambled to my feet and ran out of the room.

I found them in the kitchen, Grandpa as heated as I’d ever seen him.

“After all the years I've known you,” he was shouting at the detective. “Have I ever hurt a fly in all those years? No! This is the most disgusting allegations I have ever heard!”

I had to stop this. Without thinking, I blurted out, “Please don't arrest my grandfather. I did it to myself.”

They both turned to stare at me in stunned silence.

“I've really been feeling the need to hurt myself,” I lied. “I can't stop. See?” I held up my bloody hand, wrapped in toilet paper.  “I'm pretty messed-up in the head. But my grandfather's been trying to help me. And we're making progress. So don't arrest him. Please.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I sat on the couch, looking down at my lap, as Grandpa sat in his chair, watching me, fingertips pressed together. 

I was in a real dilemma now. My number one priority was getting out of that house. But I’d lied to protect Grandpa. Now I had to convince him that what I’d initially told the police was the truth. There was no way he was going to believe me.

“This is my fault,” he said. “I didn't anticipate this. I didn't think your condition was so serious. My fault. Not yours. Do you want to talk about why you did what you did?”

I looked up at him with resolve. “I want *you* to talk.”

 “Me?”

“I want you to look me in the eye and tell me there's nothing wrong with this house. I want you to tell me in all the years you've lived here, you've never seen anything out of the ordinary.”

Grandpa leaned in, earnestly. “There's nothing wrong with this house. I've never seen anything . . .” He trailed off and broke eye contact.

It was the first tiny crack in his facade, and I pounced on it. “What?”

Grandpa spoke slowly, softly, reluctantly. “Sometimes . . . sometimes things go missing.”

“What things?”

“The knife.”

“The kitchen knife,”  I said, thinking of Jacob Walters’ weapon of choice.

“Sometimes I find it in another room. Or in the hallway. And I could have sworn I didn't put it there.”

This was something. “What else?”

Every word now seemed like torture for Grandpa to spit out. “Voices.”

I felt so close. So close to getting him to admit that the house was haunted. So close to convincing him to get the both of us out of there, never to return. “What do the voices say?” I asked, gently.

Grandpa started to tear up. “He says, ‘Why did you kill me, Bruno? You were like a son to me.’"

I had him. I finally had him. I could barely breathe.

But the moment passed. Suddenly Grandpa's brow furrowed in anger. He wiped his tears away. “No! There is nothing in this world that cannot be explained! Either by the laws of science, or by the vagaries of the human mind! Do you understand me?”

“Ghosts can be explained!” I shot back. “Dr. Woodley was right!”

“He was crazy! Just like you!”

That stunned me into wounded silence. 

Grandpa looked remorseful. “I'm sorry. I'm sorry for saying that. I'm still confident I can help you, Lacey. But unfortunately, now we are going to have to take certain precautions.”

I was afraid to ask. “What kind of precautions?”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Clearly, something had snapped in Grandpa’s own mind. His need to cure me of my agoraphobia had become obsessive. With surprising strength for an old man, he carried me upstairs to my bedroom and attempted to strap me into one of the hospital beds.

I screamed and struggled. “No! No! Grandpa, don't do this to me! Please don't do this to me!”

“It's for your own good, Lacey,” he insisted. “We can't have you hurting yourself again.”

“I won't, I won't! I promise, I promise, I swear to God! Just please don't strap me down, please!”

“Lacey, you're making this more difficult than it has to be,” he said, after successfully strapping down my arms and trying to grapple with my kicking legs.

“No, you don't understand, he's gonna come for me again!” I said, desperately. “They're all gonna come for me, and I won't be able to run!”

“Nobody will come for you because there is nobody! You just admitted today, you were the one who hurt yourself!”

“I was lying! I made that up to save you from being arrested!”

“So first you were telling the truth and then you were lying and now you are telling the truth again? Or is it the other way around? I'm an old man, Lacey, you're confusing me.”

He managed to strap down both my legs, despite my best efforts.

“Then at least stay here with me!” I pleaded. “Grandpa, please! Don't leave me here alone!”

“You have to face your fears alone, Lacey. You're not a little baby anymore."

I started to cry, helplessly. “Please . . . please . . . don't leave me here . . . they'll kill me . . .”

“Oh, don't make such a fuss. Open up.” Grandpa inserted a mouthguard into my mouth. “Can't have you biting your tongue off. Okay. Try to get some sleep. Nighty-night.”

He was about to leave with the door open, then stopped, reconsidering. “Tonight I will lock the door. Okay? Just to humor you. We'll do this in stages. Baby steps.”

He closed the door, then I heard him stick a key in the lock and twist it. I heard him walk away, his humming gradually receding.

Tears continued to run down my cheeks. How had this happened? It was the very night after the worst thing that had ever happened to me. And yet, instead of being out of this nightmare house, Grandpa had set me up like a piece of meat in one of his bear traps. I was certain I was going to die. The only thing I could think to do was recite the Lord’s prayer in my head. Neither Dad or I were particularly religious, but nothing else came to mind.

I don’t know how long I lay there before I heard the familiar scream. It could’ve been minutes or hours. But eventually there it was – the last thing I wanted to hear. The signature sound of the berserker Jacob Walters.

I prayed that Walters was one of the incorporeal ghosts – the ones who hadn’t had enough bio-electricity at their time of death, the ones that passed right through you. But deep down, I knew that wasn’t the case, because Walters had been able to wield Grandpa’s butcher knife.

Sure enough, the doorknob rattled, as Walters tried it from outside. At least he seemed to be frustrated by solid objects like doors. But then he began repeatedly throwing his massive frame against the door, screaming and cackling all the while, and I knew it wouldn’t be long before he got through.

Suddenly, in the corner, the two benevolent young women materialized. They bent down, pointing to something. I lifted my head, straining to see what it was.

Suzie's talisman! I’d stupidly tried to throw it away, but it had missed the trash can, and now lay forgotten in the corner. The two women faded away.

Through the door, I heard Walters form actual words for the first time, instead of bestial noises. But the words sounded labored and forced, as if from an animal who had just learned to talk: “I want. To taste. Your blood.”

Mark Sheldon had a complex, delusional MO, and he loved to talk. Walters, on the other hand, was pure id. He just wanted to kill.

Somehow I had to get to that talisman. I was skeptical that it would do anything. Dr. Woodley’s theories about ghost creation seemed grounded in hard science, but an object that warded off spirits was firmly in the realm of myth. On the other hand, what choice did I have?

Still straining desperately, I discovered I could move the entire mattress, if not escape from the straps themselves. So I started shifting the mattress, inch by inch, off the bed frame, until I toppled off the side.

I landed heavily on the floor, on my front, spread-eagled, still strapped to the mattress, which was now on top of me. The wind was knocked out of me.

I looked up and saw the talisman on the floor about twelve feet away from me. I shifted my right arm forward, then my left, inching myself forward at a snail's pace.

A screw popped out of one of the door hinges, as Walters resumed his assault on the door.

After what seemed like forever, I had almost reached the talisman, positioning myself so I would be able to grab it with my right hand.

Suddenly, the door burst open, and Walters charged in, screaming to high heaven. He had the knife.

I made a grab for the talisman, but it was just out of reach.

Walters leaped onto the mattress that was attached to my back. I felt him plunge the knife down into the mattress, heard the rip of the fabric as he tore it apart. The mattress had been thick enough to protect me from his first stab, but the next one was going straight through my back.

I made a final, desperate grab for the talisman . . . and got it!

Walters immediately leapt up off the mattress and retreated. He hovered above me, as if rebuffed by an invisible barrier. He snarled in frustration. A tendril of drool escaped his lips. His saliva gathered in a little puddle on the floor, inches away from my face.

Still muttering in frustration and defeat, Walters slunk out of the room.

I lay there, catching my breath, holding onto the talisman for dear life. Walters’ puddle of saliva faded away.

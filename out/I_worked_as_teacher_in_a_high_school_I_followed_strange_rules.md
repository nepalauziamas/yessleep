Welcome to Clayton high school! 

You're probably wondering how you found this note in the staff room even after we told you everything. Well, worry not, these are just some rules you have to follow to ensure your survival.

And remember, if you fail to follow any rules, you still have rule 10 left:)

Rule 1: there is NO janitor named Henry that we hired. If you see him, do NOT acknowledge his existence 

Rule 2: we DON'T have 6 floors. Never go there. If you go, you're no longer an employee and part of our world

Rule 3: on Fridays and Thursdays, you'll have to have to teach a lesson to class 9-C. The students are not human. Don't ask them questions. Just finish your lesson and wait for them to leave.

Rules 3.5:  angering the students will result in a fate way worse then death. So, if you have the time, refer to rule 10

Rule 4: never ask the lunch lady what the meat is made of. She gets  hungry

Rule 5: Never look into the mirrors on the 3rd floor. You will not like what you see

Rule 6: if a student introduces themselves to you in the hallway and their name is Henry Willson, continue with rule 10

Rule 7: we have ONE lunch room. Always use the one with yellow doors. If u enter the one with the red doors, god help you.

Rule 8: if you see lights flicker, don't try to delay your demise. Let them feed. It will be fast 

Rule 8.5: you can also refer to rule 10

Rule 9: work with the students. You all have a lot of mutual rules

Rule 10: teachers are given a personal handgun.it's in your personal cupbor This is not for self defense.You can't kill them. This is incase you don't want to suffer a fate worse then death. Allow students to use it for themselves.

That's about it. We wish you best of luck

Don't disappoint us:)

I immediately knew this wasn't a joke. I have browsed r/nosleep way too much. I proceeded to re-read the rules until they were instilled to my memory
 
I figured out that even though I can avoid rule 6 by avoiding students, rule 8 was unavoidable and resulted in death

I made my mind that I will just finish the day here and then quit. After all I had several job offers. I only chose this place because the pay was 30$ per hour

I checked the time: it was 7:20. I still had about 40 minutes till school started. I decided to get my handgun  from the cupboard. Before you guys say that it's fake because teachers don't have personal cupboards, I want to say that It was very small.

Then, just as I was about  to grab the handgun, I realised something distressing: today was the day. It is Friday. I almost wanted to puke. I managed to control myself and figured it would be okay after 2 minutes of controlling myself 

I spent so much time writing this that I didn't realise it was 7:55. Anyways, bye for now as I have to spend a day at the school from hell.




Writers note: wow! This was my first no sleep story. I got the idea for it by browsing r/ruleshorror. Please tell me in the comments ideas to improve it. This is a series and I will add to it soon

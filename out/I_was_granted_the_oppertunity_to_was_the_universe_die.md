Death  is a funny old thing. Nothing ever truly "lives" forever. From the  smallest microbes to the Universe itself, everything inbetween will perish. **Does** perish.

I  won't go into many details as to how I managed to witness the end of  all living things, but I did, the reason I did being the motivator for  the rest of my insignificance on this planet.

My  Father was on the mantle piece, his ashes, recently departed from this  world due to a medical complication that in many ways could have been  avoidable. For months after his death I kept asking myself **how**  this could happen, how can one just vanish from the world and not take  the memories with it. My attempt to grasp the reality of death was  futile as I always came back to the same conclusion, that one day I will  die and be wiped of conciousness forever like factory resetting a hard  drive, the 1's and 0's to never be displayed in quite the same way  again.

I spent my days in a haze,  lost in thought and honestly scared of my own mortality. It ate up a lot  of my free time and made me into a slob, afraid to do anything for fear  of death knocking at my door. Many, **many**  sleepless nights spent staring at a ceiling of darkness, the faint  audio of the sleeping world outside my window and the break of a new day  dawning, it hurt me to my core knowing I would one day die.

As  I sprawled across my bed one early morning I felt my eyelids becoming  heavy just as the light poured through the cracks. A new day starting  but my previous day only just ending, intertwined in a beautiful mess. I  hadn't slept for a couple of days so I knew this was my body shutting  down for the day, battery running on empty. I slept.

Have  you ever had a lucid dream? You can control every aspect of your  visions, it is truly a breathtaking ability to posses and is something I  practice to keep my mind occupied. I entered my lucid dream, I flew  through mountain ranges and gorgeous valley's, **then it happened**.

A  voice. It spoke in a hushed tone but echoed through the "world" within  my dream. It boomed and shook the mountains and valleys I was flying  through. The voice asked me a question, it asked if I felt alone.

I said I did.

It  asked if I felt as though I was living life for the weekend, doing  things not for the passion or love but to stay busy and keep my racing  mind occupied.

I said I did.

It asked me if I wanted *perspective*.

**I said I did.**

My  flight abruptly ended, I crashed to the ground but felt no pain. As I  got to my feet, I saw that I was in a lushious forest in what appeared  to be like the middle of the Fall season. The orange and yellow leaves  falling around me but something was off. They began to fall upwards  towards the sky. Soon after I felt my body becoming weightless and  rising, slowly at first, into the sky as though gravity had inverted and  I began falling towards the dark abyss of space. I was terrified, my  lucid dream had been hijacked and turned into a nightmare. As I ascended  past the gravity belt, the wind, birds and general "earth" sounds  became distant, fading behind me as I continued my ascension towards  nothingness.

I floated through  space for what felt like an eternity, periodically passing by other  planets, gas giants, supernovas and asteroids all before looking forward  and seeing nothing but blackness. The blackest black that your brain  cannot comprehend, so deviod of light that I couldn't see my hand an  inch in front of my face.

No more stars, no more planets.

I turned around to face back and saw, well, a sphere. A sphere of dotted lights and colours, slowing fading, one by one.

The voice returned, asking me if I understood what I was looking at.

I didn't understand.

It  told me, it whispered it to my soul. I was witnessing the end of all  life in the Universe. I was witnessing the end of the Universe itselfs.

The  voice spoke to me once more: "You are so afraid of your mortality that  you have forgotton that death is just another part of the cycle of all  things. You spend the very little time you have on Earth thinking you  can leave that passion project one more day or you can forego an  opportunity for adventure because all your comforts are at home. I am  here to tell you that your short, meaningless life is made meaningful by  the content of which you fill it with. Why are you waiting? What are  you waiting for, death?"

The lights now almost all gone. A final flicker and then...

...nothing.  I just watched the Universe, and everything contained within it,  perish. Never to happen again, never to be witnessed or talked about or  understood in any way. Why was I shown this?

"So  you understand that it doesn't matter what you do, everything dies in  the end. So why wait around for things to happen. Make them happen  yourself, and don't worry about death."

The  blackness began to fill with colour and lights in the distance once  more, rapidly growing in size and shape until my entire vision was  engulfed in a bright white light.

I  opened my eyes, the sun pouring through the cracks, the sound of  chirping birds and the hum of my fan in the corner of my room. Was I  still dreaming? No, I knew I wasn't. I could feel it.

I  got myself out of bed and down to the living room. My fathers ashes sat  neatly on the side. I knelt by his side and hung my head in prayer for a  moment. I planted a kiss atop the Urn, then turned to the door.

The  air was warm, the wind ruffling my hair. I took a deep breath in and  could smell the pine from the trees, the food from the store down the  road and the sea breeze all at once. I took a moment to collect myself, a  single tear rolling down my cheek.

I opened my eyes, **I was finally ready**.

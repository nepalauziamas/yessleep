The sword glistened as I held it in my left hand. It felt heavy, like holding a lump of lead with an outstretched arm. Gripping a longsword in your non-preferred hand is never going to be easy, but when you have no other choice, it's either adapt, or die. There is no other option when one hand is chained behind your back.


"Get the coin", the deep booming voice from within my head said to me in a calm but urgent manner. 


The large, sparkling gold coin lay on the grassy ground only a few mere feet in front of me. The only thing in between me and the precious currency, was the thing with the body of a brown bear and the head like a crocodile. The Ursidae. 


The creature stood on its hind two legs and stared directly at me. It let out a warning, which emerged from its throat in the form of a low, growl. It clearly wanted me to leave it and its coin alone, but I couldn't. Not whilst I still had such a large debt to pay. 


The deep voice spoke to me once more. 


"Attack the chest, not the head. Its flesh is softer there". 


I listened to the advice and readied my sword by positioning it just behind my ear, ready to attack. I took one step towards the beast, trying my best to be as intimidating as possible, which is difficult when approaching a creature of such size and ferocity. 


"Duck"!, the deep voice from within commanded. 


I bent my knees and crouched down as a giant claw whoosed above my head. The Ursidae had beaten me to the first, but listening to the guide in my head had saved me from a swift beheading. 


I hastily stood back up, preparing to swing my sword at the Ursidae. With all my strength, and only using my left hand, I swung my longsword towards the creature. 


My sword was met by a large, brown paw that swiped at the sword. I felt my grip loosen and the long piece of forged metal was ripped from my grasp, and landed a few feet away from me. 


"You fool", the voice said to me, "Dive and grab your weapon. Now!".


I pushed my legs into the ground and sprung upwards, diving straight to where the sword had landed. As I dove, the long crocodile-like snout snapped towards me, trying to trap me between its long, pointed teeth.


I hit the ground, harder than I would've liked, but I was able to once again grab hold of my sword. 


"Get ready to stab upwards. Right…..now!".


I listened to voices commands and thrusted the swords straight up when I was told to. I felt the sword hit something soft and fleshy. Then, with a final burst of strength, I pushed the sword deeper and heard a loud growl of pain. 


I felt a liquid drip downwards onto my face and it made a slight 'ting' sound as it bounced onto metal armour. I looked up and saw the red blood pouring out the hole I had just pierced into the Ursidae's chest. It was still alive, but judging by the gaping hole in its torso, being alive was just a temporary condition.


"Quick, move out the way", the voice told me. 


I quickly crawled across the ground, not even questioning the voice, just following its instructions.


The voice had never steered me astray before, and once again, it had told me the correct thing to do. As I crawled across the ground, I heard a loud thud behind me. I turned around and saw the large body of the Ursidae had crashed down on top of where I had just been positioned.


"Thanks, Alvrakhan", I audibly said to the voice. 


"You are welcome", he replied. 


Alvrakhan, the deity that I prayed to and had responded, was the voice within my head. He was the God of Currency, and he was there to help guide me on my mission to find the gold coins that I owed.


"Grab the coin", I heard Alvrakhan say, and so I obliged. 


I picked myself up off the ground, walked past the slain Ursidae, and crouched down to pick up the glowing gold coin off the ground. 


The coin, which was the size of my palm, felt heavy in my hand. But it was a weight that I was more than happy to carry. With this coin, I only needed another twelve before I had repaid the debt. 


"Only twelve coins to go now. The debt I owe is now to you Alvrakhan. I would be a dead man if not for your guidance.", I said, gratitude present in my voice.


"You wouldn't even need me if you didn't steal from the King", he replied bluntly.


He was right. If I hadn't been caught thieving from the King, I wouldn't have a debt to repay. After I was caught, I was given a choice. Repay the debt in double, or pay the debt with my head. It was an easy decision. 


However, the King's law states that the debt shall only be paid in gold coins, and that the guilty must find the coins with one hand chained behind their back.


The thought of my head no longer being attached to my body had compelled me to start the hunt for thirty gold coins. Which was now over halfway completed, and my life could return to normal.


"Well, what are you waiting for. Place the coin into your carry sack", Alvrakhan said rather impatiently. 


I grabbed the carry bag that was strapped across my back, opened it snd delicately placed the gold coin inside. As soon as the money touched the bottom of the bag, it disappeared and Alvrakhan spoke. 


"I have collected the coin. I will carry it, along with the rest for you".


Alvrakhan had taken every coin I had collected so far, and was storing them for me somewhere. I didn't ask too many questions. He was a God after all. The God of Currency nonetheless.


I nodded in appreciation, and went to find somewhere to sit for a while, when something caught my eye.


Off to my right, I saw a dark cave that was hidden between the surrounding shrubs and bushes. I stared at it, and I thought I saw a small flash of glowing gold. More coins. 


I stood up and wandered over to the cave, intrigued by the thought that another coin may be hidden inside. 


"Where are you going"?, I heard Alvrakhan's voice say from within my head. 


Transfixed on the cave, I forgot to respond and kept walking towards the dark cave entrance. 


"Turn around. There is nothing of interest there", the deities' deep voice said. 


I moved closer, almost at the mouth of the dark hole. 


"It's much safer to stay out here in the open", he said, a slight hint of worry now in his voice. 


I pushed onwards and made it the start of the cave. I crouched down and looked inside. A faint glow of gold was present within the small tunnel. I was just about to crawl inside, excited that I had just discovered more gold coins, when Alvrakhan spoke.


"There's nothing in there. Do not go inside. Have I led you astray before?".


He was right. He had never done me wrong before, but I just had an overwhelming feeling that there was something great inside the cave.


I said nothing but continued to crawl forwards.


"DO NOT GO INSIDE THAT FUCKING CAVE", Alvrakhan yelled at me with a ferocious anger I had never heard before.


I paused for just a second, afraid of the pure rage he had just displayed. Then, a beam of white light hit my face, quickly followed by a contrasting blackness that engulfed me. 


In the darkness, I saw grey flashes and heard a loud whoosing noise. Then, as suddenly as it came, it went. And I felt myself black out.


I jumped awake, startled by the sudden loss of consciousness. I was unsure where I was now, but I knew that I was no longer inside the small cave. I felt that I was sitting down in a chair, with something over my head, covering my eyes and ears. 


I tried to stand and had just raised myself off the seat, when I was stopped by something attached to my wrist. Some sort of chain was tying me down and I was unable to stand up. 


"Remove his helmet", I heard Alvrakhans voice say, before I felt the covering over my head being lifted off. 


A dim light filled my eyes, and after a quick adjustment period, I was able to see my surroundings. I was definitely no longer in the cave. I was inside a strange warehouse, filled with long desks and computers. I shouldn't even know what computers are, I was a knight in a fantasy world, but somehow I did know. 


The warehouse I was in was washed in a dim white light and each desk was also a white colour. Everything looked clean and modern, like a strange sort of technology hub. It even smelled clean, with the strong smell of air freshener and chemicals present in the air. 


As I looked around the room I saw two people sitting at each computer, one was talking into a microphone, and the other was wearing a strange looking helmet. I turned around, confused as to what was happening, and saw that a scrawny, bald man was sitting next to me. He was dressed in a white shirt and black pants, amd almost looked like a businessman. 


He too was holding onto a small microphone and he had an expression on his face that portrayed pure rage and fear. 


"So, you found a way out, did you?", he said to me in an angered whisper.


My whole perception of the world had just completely changed and so I responded by staring at him blankly. The only thing that was still similar about where I just was and where I was now was the man's voice. He had the exact same voice as Alvrakhan. 


After waiting for me to talk and realising that wasn't going to happen, he spoke again. 


"Do you even know how big of an operation it was to get you here? To get all of you here. And you discovered the one bug in the game. The only glitch."


He shook his head, in both anger and disappointment and stared at me as if I had personally failed him. He continued to talk. 


"You couldn't just listen to my guidance could you? No, that would be too easy. I know you're not the first to break out of the program, and I doubt you'll be last, but I still don't enjoy having to deal with the escapees". 


At this point, I was filled with a mix of total confusion and no small amount of fear. Program? Escapees? For what I thought was my entire life, I believed I had lived in a land ruled by a tyrannical king, and monsters and beasts were at every corner. But maybe that was not the case.


 All of this bewilderment swirled around inside my mind, with each section of my brain trying its best to piece together what was happening. My confused brain waves all worked together to rationalise what was occuring, but each puzzled thought joined together and culminated in one simple sentence.


"What is going on?"


The businessman looked at me for a second, before a slight smile appeared on his face and he started to answer my question. 


"Well, here at Alvrakhan technologies, we try our best to be innovative, creative and of course make money. And, as I'm sure you know, crypto currency is the next big thing in the world of finance. And Alvracoin is going to be the most profitable. Of course, most popular in slightly less than legal trade". 


He was about to keep on speaking, but I saw him catch himself from continuing. He paused for a second and then spoke again. 



"I always say more than I'm supposed to, but I am just proud of the work we do here. But, the rest is not something you need to know. You don't need to know anything else".


The bald man then looked up, just past the top of my head and spoke one last time. 


"Put him with the rest of the escapees". 


A firm hand clasped down on my shoulder, and then a second hand reached down and grabbed the chain that was holding me captive to the desk. The bald man then reached across, with a key in his hand, and unlocked the cuff that was chained to the desk. Once unlocked, the bald man lifted the loose cuff and placed it onto the other person's wrist and locked it again. 


"Get up!", I heard a deep voice say from just behind me. 


I did as I was told and stood up, feeling how weak my legs had become from being locked up inside this warehouse. I saw that I was handcuffed to a tall, very strong looking man who looked exactly like a security guard should. A tug at my wrist then forced me to walk forwards and I was almost dragged out of the warehouse. 


I didn't know where I was being taken, all I knew was that it was going to be with the rest of the 'escapees', which I knew wasn't going to be somewhere nice. I felt genuine panic within me, and I wished I was back in the land of swords and monsters. The program seemed like a much nicer place. 


I was hauled through the warehouse, passing multiple people with helmets on their heads, and other, businessman looking types, giving instructions through a microphone. 


The security guard dragging me made it to a large, metal door and stopped to scan a small ID tag that was attached to his belt. I heard a small 'click' and he pushed the door open. 


We went through the door and out into a small foyer area that contained a few couches and a reception area that was currently empty. There was also another door that seemed to lead outside. 


Above the doorway was a large sign that read 'Alvrakhan Technology", in a fancy new-age font. Just underneath the writing, two longswords hung in a criss-cross, which I believed showed the sinister nature of what was really going on here. 


The security guard continued to pull me forward, and we were just passing underneath the sign when I had the idea. 


With my free hand, I quickly reached up and grabbed one of the longswords that was attached to the wall and yanked it free. I brought it down and, in one swift movement, I swung it at the wrist of the guard's hand-cuffed hand. 


Due to my extensive training within the program, I had mastered the art of sword fighting, and especially with one hand chained up. The sword easily passed through the guard's wrist and his hand detached from the rest of his forearm. I heard a loud screech of pain, but I didn't stop to see the aftermath. I pushed past the guard and shoved the door open, running outside into the opening of a large field.


I was in some sort of remote area, which wasn't surprising considering the type of operation that was being run here. I kept running through the open field, desperately trying to escape from the hell I had found myself in. Fear and panic were the two driving forces behind the amount of speed I was able to get out of my legs. 


I almost didn't see the giant hole in the field, due to the desperation to get as far away from here as possible, but I managed to stop myself at the last second. 


I looked down into the large, man made hole in the grassy ground, and was horrified by what I saw. A dozen or so bodies were thrown into the pit, all of them looked malnourished, and all of them were dead. These must have been the 'escapees'.


I let out a gasp, and a small squeal followed, but terror quickly overode the feeling of shock, and I was able to move my feet again. I ran around the edge of the pit, avoiding looking into it again and continued to run through the large field. 


After running for god-knows how long, I found a small road that ran just along the edge of the field. I waited at the side of the road, expecting someone to find me at any moment, and take me back to the pit, but no one came. Only a small, green hatchback came later that evening, and I was able to flag it down and drive off, back to safety. 


This was over a year ago now, and I had to learn how to adjust back to normal life and try to forget the events at Alvrakhan Technology. This was no easy feat, and through the past year, small glimpses of memories have come back to me. 


I remember sitting at home and someone breaking in through the front door. I remember something getting injected into my neck. I remember something being placed onto my head and my vision turning to black. And I remember playing video games competitively. And I was good at it. Really good.

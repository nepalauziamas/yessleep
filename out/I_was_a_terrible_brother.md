I posted about [my situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vi5bmb/im_a_terrible_brother/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)  a few days ago, and got a whole bunch of really helpful comments on how to get my brother back. Here's an update.

I was especially convinced by u/Reasoable-Pack1067’s suggestion that I look out for signs of Mike around me, in case he’s now taken the original place of that boy, in the spirit world, and was wandering the house, trying to reach out to me. I decided to research the shit out of similar occurrences, to see what I could do for Mike.

I found a medium. I decided against an exorcist, purely because I found none that seemed both legitimate and non-violent. I couldn’t bear the thought of seeing Mike’s body being held down, struggling tooth and nail, his veins turning black, as that evil asshole was torn from his body. Yes I’ve watched way too many exorcisms on TV. This medium seemed to be known for being able to get through to ghosts, to mediate matters between the spirits and the living, in a peaceful way. She had apparently once been a psychologist, before embracing her psychic nature and becoming a medium. I hoped that that thing, Jimmy, would somehow be able to be reasoned with. I vetted her the way I would vet anyone I’m thinking of hiring. I checked out her reviews on multiple platforms, read through her qualifications, and even reached out to some of her past clients to check in with them about her. I think it spoke volumes that most of the past clients I reached out to were willing to chat with me, just to convince me how awesome she had been for them.

“Come in,” I said awkwardly, gesturing to the open doorway. At the back of my mind, I was wondering about her boldness. Meeting strangers, being alone with a guy in an empty house.  Then again, it was broad daylight, and in this town, there was no going anywhere without having been seen by someone.

She seemed almost to drift into the house, so natural and graceful were her movements. She looked around slowly, seeming to take in the essence of the house. Or so I assumed. I had no idea how mediums functioned.

Her gaze alighted on the waist high drawer by the kitchen. “Hmm…” she murmured.

“Yes? Do you sense something?” I asked nervously, feeling a little foolish.

“That space seems to hold a lot of positive energy. Happy memories. But I’m not really sure how, it seems to just be a drawer,” she mused.

I felt my upper cheeks and eyes heat up, as tears began to prickle.

“That’s…that’s where Mike would climb onto when he wanted piggyback rides.” I said, my voice gruff.

“Oh,” she looked at me with sympathy in her eyes. “You really care for him.”

I gave a quick nod and averted my eyes. “We have a good hour or so before anyone else comes home, before that thing comes back,” I said briskly. “Please look around, tell me if you sense anything. If you sense…Mike.”

She smiled gently, and nodded. “I will,” she said, then hesitated. “Mike, if he’s now in…well, spirit form, he would be pretty new a spirit, and may not yet have the strength or ability to make himself visible or audible to you, even with…rituals. If I do find traces of him, I will have to interpret him for you.”

“Do whatever you need to do. You have to help Mike. Please.”

“I will. Trust me. I will do everything in my power to help.” The earnestness in her eyes was unmistakable.

I followed her around the house from a distance, wanting to give her as much space as she needed.

She didn’t have any sage, crystals, bells, or any of the things I had associated with mediums. I guess I had never actually looked into how mediums practiced. I mean, it had never even crossed my mind to give credence to any of that type of activity in the past.

It was in Mike’s room that she paused, and closed her eyes for a long moment. Then she knelt down next to the bed, and placed her hand on a spot on the bed, almost tenderly. She stared at the space above her hand, a look of sorrow crossing her face.

“I don’t *see* him here, he’s not yet strong enough to form a spiritual body. But I feel him here. His energy, his spirit, is here. And he feels…so sad.” As she spoke, tears began to well in her eyes. “He feels lost. I sense regret, sadness. And that he misses his family. He misses you.”

I gulped, feeling a surge of sorrow overwhelm me. I couldn’t speak, for fear it would erupt.

“He’s so frightened,” she added, and tears spilt from her eyes. I couldn’t bear it. I left the room, sobbing.

She gave me some time to calm down, and only joined me a while later.

“I need to talk to the other boy. The one in his body.  Jimmy, right? I need to convince him to leave. Of his own free will. That will cause the least amount of harm to Mike.”

I didn’t know how to respond. I wasn’t sure that boy could be reasoned with. But that was the whole purpose of her being here, after all.

“Just tell my parents you’re Kane’s cousin, come to visit. Kane’s my buddy, he’d cover for me, if need be. Say that you’re here to interview for the temporary baby-sitting gig,” I said. I really hoped they wouldn’t call Kane to check. Kane would cover for me, no doubt, but I’d have to explain things to him after, which I wanted to avoid, as much as possible.

She frowned. “I don’t like lying to others.”

I stared at her pleadingly. “Please, they wouldn’t allow you to talk to Jimmy otherwise. Or hang out here at all. They don’t believe me about what happened to Mike. They’d blow a fuse if they knew you were a medium. If they knew I hired you.”

She thought for a while, a frown creasing her brows, then nodded.

I thanked her, relieved. Then we waited for my parents, and that boy, to come home.

Luckily, my parents seemed to take to her very quickly. They tended to be guarded, cautious around others, especially when it came to potential babysitters to whom they might be entrusting their precious little boy. Perhaps it was her aura, some sense they had about her, but they very quickly warmed up to her, and invited her to stay for dinner, to get to know her more.

That boy, on the other hand was immediately on edge upon seeing her. He seemed to somehow guess at what she was. He hid his discomfort well, but I could see his gaze repeatedly sliding back to her face throughout dinner.

Dinner went well. My parents were all ready to give her the job. She seemed kind, funny, sweet, and they were sorely in need of a babysitter, especially since I had steadfastly refused to watch over ‘Mike’ for the past year.

“I like to talk to my potential clients, one on one, to get to know them better. To see if they’re comfortable with me. Would you mind if I did that?” She asked my parents as she was helping to clear the dishes. I saw Jimmy freeze. Worried that my parents would notice his fear, I piped up.

“I’ll join them, make sure things are fine.” I saw the surprised looks on my parents’ faces. They seemed pleased that I wanted any contact at all with that little shit, and quickly agreed.

We headed to Mike’s room, Jimmy looking nervous and tense.

“Jimmy, right?” she said, once the door shut.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m Mike,” the little shit retorted.

“It’s okay. I’m not here to make you do anything. I just want to understand you. How you’re feeling, what you’re doing here, what you hope to achieve.”

Jimmy remained sullenly quiet.

“Here,” she said, holding out a hand, palm up, to Jimmy. “Sense it yourself. You can sense others’ feelings and intentions if you try, right? Especially with contact.”

I felt a rush of anger. So that was how it was able to so easily manipulate Mike. It could sense Mike’s feelings, Mike’s intentions, probably sense Mike’s pureness.

Jimmy reluctantly reached out and held her hand. He frowned for a moment or two, then relaxed visibly.

“You…you do want to help me,” he said to her.

It was my turn to frown. Help him? She wanted to help him? An alarm went off in my mind.

“Yes, I want to help you. I want to help Mike too. Mike is really sad, Jimmy.” She said, and the tension eased in my body. *Okay, she seems to be on Mike’s side,* I thought.

Jimmy let go of her hand, and looked away, a surly look clouding his face. “He promised. He agreed to this.”

That goaded me. I opened my mouth to yell at him, but she silenced me with a stare.

“He did, Jimmy. Because he cared for you. Because he really likes you. Maybe even loves you. You’re his friend, and he wanted to help you. Make you happy,” she said, her tone filled with sincerity.

“Then he can help me, by keeping his promise. I got his body for two years.”

Despite my anger, I felt a tight knot within loosen a little. It seemed Jimmy did intend to return Mike’s body, eventually. Or so he said.

“Yes Jimmy, but he didn’t know it would be so dark. So scary, where he has to be. So lonely. He can’t even speak to you, Jimmy. He can’t even form a body or a voice. He’s so, so afraid. So so sad.”

Jimmy looked away, and I was shocked to see a tinge of guilt and sadness flicker on his face. Did that thing have some humanity?

“That’s where I was for years, too. Before I managed to show myself to him, to anyone,” he insisted.

“Yes Jimmy. It must have been so scary for you too. I’m so sorry you had to go through all of that. I wish you didn’t have to. It must have been so lonely.”

Jimmy began to cry. “It was,” he whimpered.

Despite myself, I felt a twinge of pity. A twinge I quickly shoved aside.

“But Jimmy, you learnt to cope. And Mike, this is his body, his life, yet he was willing to lend it to you, out of the kindness of his heart, and his love for you. And he hasn’t learnt to cope,” she continued.

“He will learn,” Jimmy said, his tears stopping, his voice hardening.

“But Jimmy, you can go. You can go off and be happy. You can leave this world behind, and finally be happy, at peace. I’ve spoken to many like you, you know? I’ve sent them on to the next place, and so often, right before they pass from our world, they are able to tell me how calm they feel. How happy, how at peace. That they sense a beautiful bliss from the place they’re headed into.”

Jimmy looked up, with a mix of curiosity, wonder, and caution on his face.

“Hold my hand, see if I’m telling the truth,” she said, once again offering her hand to him. Jimmy held it, and his eyes widened slowly.

“You mean it?” He asked, in a small voice. “The next place is a good place?”

She smiled, a warm, soothing beam that seemed to cast the room in tenderness.

“Yes, from all I’ve gathered, yes indeed.”

Jimmy was silent for a long time.

“Please, Jimmy,” I couldn’t help chiming in. I tried to make my tone as gentle and even as possible. To my surprise, my voice sounded warm. My revulsion towards Jimmy seemed to have faded. There was still resentment, anger and bitterness, but at a much lesser intensity than before. Maybe it was that look of sadness. Or his look of fear and forlornness, when he had talked about his past. Or maybe it was the fact that he was starting to seem more and more human to me, more and more like an ordinary little boy, not the devil I’d thought him to be. I immediately felt guilt for feeling any ounce of compassion for Jimmy, the one who’d cast my brother into darkness. And for the gentle way that I was speaking to him. *It’s all for Mike,* I told myself, and continued.

“I love Mike. I miss him. I know he misses me too. It’s sad your life was short. That it was difficult for you. But this is Mike’s life. This is Mike’s family. And I want him back, so bad.”

Jimmy blinked, and tears came into his eyes again.

“But I want to feel it. I want to experience that. To have family, who cares. I’ve been so happy with them,” he gestured towards the door, indicating my parents.

“You will be happy, and safe, and in a good place with good people, once you move on,” she said.

Jimmy was silent again, save for little sobs. Then he finally spoke.

“I want you to be my big brother. Just for a while. Be nice to me. Be to me like you were with Mike.” He said, pleading with me with his eyes.

I froze. I wasn’t up for it. He was not my brother. I couldn’t possibly treat him like he was Mike. Mike is the only one who would ever be my brother. He saw the look on my face, and spoke again.

“Just a day? Please? A full day of being my big brother. I want to know how Mike felt with you.”

I tried to swallow the sense of distaste and sickness I felt. Treating him like I would Mike. After he had tricked Mike out of his body. But if it would get Mike back…

“You promise to leave after?” I asked, forcing down the sudden rush of nausea.

His face brightened.

“Yes! I do! I promise!”

My jaw tightened, then I nodded. There was nothing else for it.

This better get me my brother back.

I woke up early the next morning, with dread and hope in my heart. Treating Jimmy like he was Mike, that was going to be rough. He wanted a really good day, a happy last hurrah for him before he let Mike back into his body. And now I knew he could sense intentions and feelings. So I guessed I was going to have to rustle up all my compassion and good will, to appease him.

The medium had reassured me that she sensed sincerity in Jimmy, and that had really helped drain a lot of the vitriol that had remained in me. It had also poured hope into my heart. If he would really return my brother, if he was really going to leave this world after this one day, then I could probably afford to show him some warmth for the day.

I got dressed and went to the dining area. He was there, all dressed and ready to go.

“Hi Matt!” he yelled.

“Hey Mikey,” I said, as cheerfully as I could. I ignored the look of surprise and disbelief that bloomed on my mother’s face.

His face glowed with a beatific smile.

“You ready to head out?” I asked, unnaturally jovial. I cringed at the forced tone of my voice. Luckily, Jimmy didn’t seem to mind. He nodded enthusiastically, and jumped up, all ready to go.

He looked just like an innocent, excitable kid. I couldn’t help but feel a tiny bit touched.

*I’ll treat him like he’s Mike today. I’ll forget it’s Jimmy. I’ll give Jimmy that, since it’s the one thing he needs before he leaves,* I thought. *This is Mike, this is Mike,* I repeated to myself.

“Come on! Let’s go then!” I called out. My mum’s jaw dropped further.

Jimmy ran back to give each of my parents a tight hug, and a kiss goodbye.

We headed to the library. Yes, the library. The kid had chosen, of all places, the library, to spend the first half of the day at. I suggested ice cream, theme parks, the ice rink, but no. He wanted the library.

“Why do you wanna go to the library, Jimmy?”

Jimmy paused, looking at me with an expression of sadness and nostalgia. It was odd to see nostalgia on a little kid’s face.

“I ran away once, when I was alive. I ran all the way to the library, and hid there. I saw a boy there, with his dad. His dad was reading to him from a book, and the boy was asking him about all the words he didn’t understand. I felt so…weird. I was really sad, but also happy, watching them.” Jimmy’s gaze seemed faraway as he spoke. Then he looked at me and said, quietly,  “I want that today.”

I nodded, my heart going out to him. At the same time, I felt fear. I still didn’t like that I was feeling for this boy. After all, I wasn’t sure if he’d return Mike to me. I swiped my fears to the back of my mind, and nodded. “You’ll get that today, Jimmy.”

We spent a good half of the day just reading at the library, Jimmy sat by my side, picking out books he wanted, reading some pages, but mostly getting me to read to him. He asked many questions, about words, characters, why people did the things they did.

I was beginning to realise that he was truly just a kid. A lonely kid. By the time we left the library, I felt a fondness for him that I could never have imagined developing just a day ago. Of course, I was still worried about Mike, and whether I’d get him back. But after the hours spent together, I was more and more convinced that Jimmy meant Mike no harm. That he’d keep his promise.

*Or that’s what you want to believe,* the unsettling thought niggled in my mind.

We had a quick lunch after that, then went to the park. Jimmy wanted to play with dogs at the park. He had always had a love for dogs, but the man he lived with never allowed him near one. Or let him have one.

I sat on the bench and watched as he ran about excitedly, approaching different dogs and patting them whenever he could. I looked at the joy bursting from him, listened to his squeals of delight, and felt a rush of endearment towards him. The dogs seemed to like him all right, too. That, to me, is always a sign of a good person. I mean, dogs were supposed to be extra-sensitive and stuff, right?

I marvelled at his energy as the hours passed. He had been running around for a full 2 hours. I went to get us ice cream, which only seemed to make him even more psyched.

“THEY ARE SO CUTE! THERE ARE SO MANY DOGS HERE!” He shrilled. I couldn’t help laughing.

“Yes, kiddo, there are.” He plopped down next to me on the bench, happily eating his ice cream.

“I’m so happy,” he said, his voice suddenly gentle.

I reached out and ruffled his hair, before I could stop myself. He looked up at me, eyes brimming with tears. We said nothing for a long while.

Our medium showed up soon after, as planned, and she came lugging a big bag.

I frowned. “Is that medium stuff?”

She laughed, and said, “No, this is picnic stuff. Jimmy here wanted a picnic to end off the day, right?”

Jimmy nodded excitedly. I gaped as she pulled out a mat, plates, cups, flasks, tupperwares and a whole bunch of picnic paraphernalia. I had always thought picnics just meant, you know, buying a sandwich and eating it at a bench or something. Yea, my family wasn’t big into picnics.

She had prepared a huge feast. We helped set up, then tucked into the food, chatting, laughing, enjoying the sunshine. As the sun set, we lay quietly on the mat, watching the burning amber swirls in the sky.

“I don’t want this day to end,” Jimmy piped up in a small voice. “I wish this could last forever.”

I felt sadness, then a tightness in my gut, and a cold fear. Jimmy had better not go back on his word.

“I know,” the medium said softly. “Jimmy, you’re going to have all these wherever you’re going. I’m certain of it. You’re going to have people who love you, the way Matt loves Mike.”

I turned, and felt a wave of relief as I saw Jimmy nod.

“Are you ready?” she asked. Jimmy nodded again.

“He’s here,” she said. “Mike’s with me, I dropped by the house for him before we got here.”

I immediately felt nauseated. Mike was here, watching me enjoy the day with Jimmy? Betraying him by treating this boy like he was Mike? My face paled. The medium seemed to sense my thoughts. “He’s happy you guys had fun,” she said. “He wants Jimmy to have a good day before he leaves.”

Relief welled up, combined with an intense admiration for Mike’s kindness. Mike truly has a beautiful soul.

“Bye Matt,” Jimmy said softly.

“Bye Jimmy,” I said, a tremble in my voice.

I watched as he closed his eyes. Soon, a cloud of dark smoke left Mike’s body, triggering an overwhelming rush of relief within me. It hovered in the air for a few moments, then the medium gently placed her hands near the dark smoke and closed her eyes. Nothing seemed to happen for a while. Then the smoke slowly dispersed, and he was gone. I thought I detected some sparkles in the air, but that could’ve been my imagination.

“Mike? Mike, you okay?” I shook Mike.

Mike stirred.

“Matty?” he spoke, in a small voice. The unmistakable voice of my little brother. My heart leapt.

“MIKEY!” I yelled, and bear-hugged him, tears pouring down my face. My little brother was back. I’ve got my little brother back. I began to sob uncontrollably, the immense rock of shame and guilt I’d been carrying around finally beginning to crumble.

“You saved me,” he whispered, and buried his face in my chest.

I smiled through my tears. I got my brother back.

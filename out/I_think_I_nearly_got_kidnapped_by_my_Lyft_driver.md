The day started great, I was enjoying some quality time with my family before they drove me to the airport to go back to college. I recently turned 21 and my dad was able to get a 1st class ticket on miles. Sufficed to say I was excited to take full advantage of the free drinks on the plane. 

Three gin and tonics later, I landed, at about 1am and I get my bag and wait for my Lyft at the pickup area. The Lyft driver got turned around and went to the wrong location but I told him where I was and he came around and found me. He apologized and gave me a water as consolation which I didn’t drink.

As we are driving along I am just watching tiktok trying to make the time pass as my roommates were excited for me to return and we were going to celebrate. 

About 15 minutes outside of my college’s town, my driver pulls over on the side of the highway, puts it in park and “pops the hood” of the car. Or at least I thought he did, I realized he never pressed the button to unlock the hood latch. He is in the front of the car looking in with his phone flashlight through the grill of the car which I thought was odd. He had popped the trunk right? He briefly came back in the car and I asked him what’s going on. 

“The car seems to be overheating I’m not sure what’s wrong, “ he says. I’m a bit confused but just take his word for it although I noticed no signs of the car overheating, no smoke, the heat gauge didn’t seem to indicate anything, nothing. He goes back outside and I call my roommate, T,  to let him know what’s going on. 

“Yo T, I’m a little sketched out right now my Lyft is pulled over on the highway and is claiming his car is overheating. Just so you know I’m near [exit number] and [mile marker]. I don’t think anything’s actually wrong but I just want to be safe.” 

“We’ve already started drinking so I don’t think I can come pick you up, but good that you told me where you are,” T said. 

As im on the phone with T, the driver calls someone up. I figure he’s calling AAA to get a tow truck out there. He then comes back into the car to tell me his brother was coming to pick me up. This fully triggered my fight or flight response and I started to panic. 

I have commented to my roommates that a metal water bottle would make a good improvised weapon if you were ever in need of defending yourself, and so I took out my hydro flask from my backpack and held it firmly in my hand.
Then I call my mom and explain the situation.

“Mom,” I say shakily “my Lyft driver pulled over on the side of the highway and is telling me his brother is coming to pick me up because he’s having engine trouble, I don’t feel safe I’m not sure what to do.”  

My mom tells me to tell her my location and to stay on the phone with her which I do.

I then get out of the car and ask the driver if he can just drive me over to a nearby buissness park so I can call a new Lyft. 

He says, “no need! My brother is on his way he should be here in 15 minutes’” in a cheerful voice that verged on threatening. 

I say,” can I just have my bags then? I’m just going to walk over there.” 

He again goes, “ why I promise my brother is coming he will take you the rest of the way.” 

I repeat, “ no it’s ok im going to call a new Lyft, can you open the trunk and give me my bag?”  

He keeps persisting, “it’s my own brother he will take you the rest of the way.”

He very reluctantly opens the trunk and I take my bag out and tell him fearfully, “ you’ll still get paid I’m just going to get a new Lyft” 

I then sprint across the highway and a highway on-ramp to get out of there as fast as possible. I turn around to see him angry talking to someone on the phone and walking back to the drivers seat of the car. 

I turn back around jump down an embankment, over a fence, and into the business park. 

I  stay on the phone with my mom as my dad calls Lyft to report the driver until I get picked up by my new Lyft.

Coincidentally my Lyft takes the same on-ramp I had ran across and I look over to see the car is gone. This all but confirmed my suspicion that he was having no engine trouble whatsoever. I then, as calmly as I can, ride back to my house and explain what happened to my roommates. 

I’m not sure if I was over reacting but I’m glad I aired on the side of caution.

Edit: The worst part, since he was driving me to my house, he knows my address…

I groaned turning off the alarm clock. Today was the day of our school trip but I wasn't excited, neither were my classmates. All that we were going to do is tour some temples, go to a museum and then hotel where they'll probably take away our phones. 

I sighed getting up, mom was probably at her job by now. She'll be pissed if she realises I woke up late again. During this time, my classmates already started to message in the group talking about the trip. Only a minority of them was actually excited, the others not so much. 

I don't have much time left. I went to the washroom, brushed my teeth and got ready for school. We don't even need any books, just our clothes and brushes, we can bring a camera if we want to but that's about it.

I sat on my seat looking out the window trying to enjoy the view, though the kids in front of me weren't really making it easy to. My 'friends' were sitting in a seat away from me. Since according to them there wasn't enough space for me to fit in. 

But who cares about them now? All I am going to do is focus on this trip that I don't even like but had to go to because of my mom. Jesus... 

The bus stopped, "Alright kids! We're at the museum. Stick close and do not do anything that will land you in trouble!" The teacher sternly announced, poor her thinking that either of these kids will listen to her. 

The kids got out of the bus one by one and right when it was my turn, one of my friends took it. "Sorry! I was in a hurry." He says, smiling. *Apparently waiting for his own turn was that hard.*

"Wow..." *This place looks haunted.* 

"Damn, this place looks haunted." Maya replied, stepping up. 

"Remember what I said earlier and stay with your guide!" 

"Yes ma'am." The rest of the class replied although pretty sure that some of them still won't follow through. 

We just entered and this place was huge! Holy shit, it looked way more like a castle than a museum. 

Right when I thought this wasn't so bad someone tapped my shoulder. It was...Aman.

"What's wrong?"

"I have to pee." 

I sighed, "Then tell the teacher..."

"I can't. It's too embarrassing."

"What do you want me to do then?"

"Let's go to the washroom together."

"Do you even know where it is?"

"You ask too much. Let's just go."

Without asking I went with him which turned out to be a *terrible* idea. We stood there in the middle of nowhere. The only other room we saw had "Do not enter" written on it. 

"What do we do now?" I say tapping his shoulder. He didn't reply and went inside the room. 

"What are you even doi-?!" He covered my mouth. 

"Shh just follow my lead." He held my wrist and led me inside the room...which seemed more like a library. Looking around I found a shelf which had only one book inside it. 

He got the book out of there and started to read it. "What if we get in trouble?" I say, slightly peeking in the book, it was the picture of a hallway of a mansion. 

"Dreams bleeding to reality...? What is this corny shit?!" He says shutting the book. 

"Meh, this wasn't fun. Let's go." He held my wrist and started to lead the way back to class. 

"...I don't get it. Didn't you want to pee?"

"Meh I don't feel like it anymore."

*We got back to the hotel safely after...but...why do I still feel so uneasy?*

"Ayy fatso! You're next." He says, towel covering her head. 

"God damn it! Atleast flush the toilet asshole!" Aman shut the door. 

"Yeah yeah whatever." He chuckled and then glanced at me. 

"Oi I just noticed. You've been quiet the entire time during this trip."

I raised my eyebrows, "...What?"

"No, I mean-"

"Shut up already! Some of us want to sleep!"

"Okay okay...chill!"

He says, lying his head down the pillow. I wanted to sleep too but the fear wasn't letting me sleep properly. Though...after some time my eyes got heavy and...**i drifted away...**

I opened my eyes up and...what is this? The same place that I saw at the book. I got up and started walking, seems like I was dreaming. 

I kept walking and walking till my legs started to hurt, just when I thought of stopping, I heard a noise. I looked behind me, my eyes widened...it was a tall shadowy figure though its eyes were elsewhere. 

I stepped back and tripped down, alerting it. The moment it saw me it screamed and attacked me with what seemed like tentacles. I tried to get up but it covered my leg with its gooey and slimy tentacle, even a single touch of it burned. 

I wasn't able to walk because of my bruised leg and right when it aimed for my neck the alarm clock rang. I gasped realising it was just a dream. Only 3 of the 5 guys in this room were awake. 

"Nightmare hm?" Sameer said getting in the washroom. I nodded, though I was still having trouble comprehending this. I touched my ankle and what I saw made my heart drop. There was a burn mark right over the area in which *that* touched me.

The wedding was nothing grandiose-- Wed under the cover of a giant oak tree, bathed in the splendor of a peaceful forrest in the afternoon. It was simple but magical.

Families conjoined through marriage, a happy wedding filled with well wishes, tears, hellos and goodbyes. It was the pinnacle of a happy occasion, love adorned the air. Her dress was a silk white gown woven to fit her body perfectly, his black satin suit tailored to perfection.

Vows were spoken with misty eyes, the bride's kiss was made under warm sunlight.

Honeymooned in Hawaii; feeling as though true joy was discovered for the first time. Together, forever, and ever, at peace.

Moving in together, a family was formed.

The first child was born. A healthy baby boy, named after a constellation, a star child he was. A perfect addition to the family. Happiness grew another fold. No wrong could be seen in the eyes of the boy.

A promotion, another raise at work. A salery increase of a significant percent.

Moving out of the old house was hard, but it was not without joy. Another child was on its way, a larger house was needed and deserved.

Soon, the mother was pregnant again. The family was overwhelmed with joy.

A humble home, a quiet life. A supportive suburban community, a happy wife. A husband who provided the needs of a pregnant woman, a child that did well in school.

The next child was born few months later--

Unhealthy.

It was a baby girlâ€”deformed from the head down to her toes.  An acidic looking burn of multiple degrees ran along her skin. A twisted head, crooked legs, beady eyes and warthy skin.

Disgust and gossip rippled through the town.

Ashamed, embarrassed, angry, the mother felt it all.

Five years past, five years too many. A mother she was, but a good one she was not. Rages and hatred, beatings and thrashing; the home was not happy. The mother saw it through.

She finally decided she would be a mother no more, not to the girl. Not to *that* girl.

She could not look at her daughter anymore.

It was not her daughter anymore.

A father no more and a brother no more aswell. They cursed the child as they walked to the forrest together.

They felt freedom when they left, a single subtraction to the family.

Left in the woods to die, she was. Left to rot. Left out to the elements to die.

But, the girl had grown resourceful through her few short years. Abuse had seen it through.

The girl did not die. Capable, willing to survive.

The forrest became her home, away from any judgement.

Many years past, many years too many.

She never forgot, her plan was quite ready.

She found her old house, and caught them in their sleep.

Deformed she still was, but alone she was not.

The screams from the acid told her she was not.

Unlike them, I love my family.

Deformed or not.

The heat of the sun beat down hard on the white sailboat. There was only a single cloud in sight, and the ocean waters were placid. I stood up front, watching the approaching atoll with curiosity.

“You see that?” I turned back to the man who was steering the vessel.

“That wreckage?” He replied.

“Yeah, someone could be in serious danger. I don’t see anyone around it but they could be knocked out inside, so let’s check it out when we get there.”

“Of course.”

As the sailboat came closer to the atoll, I began calling out for any survivors of the wreck.

“Hello! Anyone there?”

I called again and again but received no response. It was another similarly sized sailboat, but was split into two. The mast had crashed down and the sail itself was ripped into shreds and spread across the sand. Seagulls were circling it like vultures and diving down. I had never seen a boat so destroyed in my whole life.

“We haven’t had any bad storms recently right Nathan?” I asked the man at the wheel.

“No, none at all. I don’t know what could have done that.”

The ocean was beautiful, but like all nature, it was random and chaotic. Despite what many of the average population probably thought, shark attacks are pretty rare. And in Hawaii where I was from, it only happened around once every two years. And I had only heard of one fatality in my entire lifetime. Unfortunately, I had witnessed one of these attacks. It was off the coast of Maui, at one of my favorite spots to take my customers. The customers this time were friends so I was more casual this time, more careless. I had decided to leave my spear back up on the boat. And during our dive, we happened to spot a tiger shark.

This was no alarm to me as I had seen hundreds of sharks in my dives, but my customers sort of panicked. I calmed them down, as they would not bother us as long as kept our distance. This one shark felt differently, however. Once it had spotted our group it made a beeline for us. I had never seen one move so fast, it was like it was possessed by a demon. We begin to try to swim away, but the shark came in for a large bite on one of my customers, ripping off part of his arm. And after that, it just left. It was a surreal experience with all the blood and his screaming. The shark hadn’t gotten a lot of his bone so it was just protruding out from the new stump by where his elbow used to be. The man luckily survived, as we were able to get back to the boat and to a hospital in time before he bled out. Many people would have probably never touched the ocean again after that, but I kept going. I had a company to run and I couldn’t let one bad incident kill my passion. I realized that like everything in life, what I did came with risk. 

Nathan brought the sailboat to the sand, and it came to a stop once it hit it. I immediately jumped off of the bow of the boat and begin running towards it. Nathan followed after me.

“Check the back half, I’ll check the front,” I commanded him. He nodded and ran over to his half. Within a few seconds I was at mine, and looking into the gaping hole of the cabin.

“Hey!” I called into it, but received no reply. I jumped into it and looked around. The front half of this cabin was a kitchen and a lounge area, which was nicely wooden furnished. It was however trashed by whatever force had destroyed the boat. Appliances were everywhere, and what food was left was being picked at by the seagulls. They all flew off when I came. I judged by the fact that all the food wasn’t gone meant that this had to have crashed very recently. The two oddest things about the cabin however were a broken fish tank and a helmet of some sort. The fish tank was fairly large and sitting on the counter, with the front glass shattered. I didn’t know why anyone would have a fish tank on a boat, but there were some eccentric people in the world. Something about this one thought gave me the creeps for some reason, and I felt an odd unexplainable sense of dread looking at it. The helmet was just as bizarre. It looked like almost a dark grey astronaut helmet or a helmet from some sci-fi movie. I thought it was some fake toy at first but picked it up to discover it weighed and looked real. I decided to not set it back and came back outside with it in my grip.

Nathan was walking around the side of his half.

“You find anyone Sione?” He asked when he saw me.

“No, just this odd helmet. Check this thing out,” I handed it to him. He moved it up in down in his hands.

“This feels like something from NASA, not something that belongs on a boat.

“What do you think happened to the people on it?”

“Well if they’re not here, they could have drowned. Or maybe they’re out there still on a life raft…”

“We should call the Coast Guard right now, they can get to searching.”

“Alright, our phones are back in the boat. But first I noticed something out by the water. It was one of those bottles with a message in it. Like something you’d see in a movie,” Nathan said to me as we stepped out onto the sand. He begin walking in the direction of the water and I quickly spotted what he was talking about. It was sitting right at the edge, half buried by the sand and being hit by the tiny waves. Once Nathan got to it he pulled it out of the sand and turned it upside down, allowing the rolled-up paper to fall out. It was worn out, torn up, and old looking. He studied it for a few seconds, and I noticed his gaze turn to one of confusion.

“What is it? Some kind of S.O.S?” I asked him as I walked closer.

“No, no. It’s some kind of map of some sort. But like, an old map…” he said and handed it to me. I took it from him and studied it. It was a map alright, but one of what looked like a crude version of Europe, Africa, and the Indian Ocean. It was labeled in some foreign language and had drawings of all sorts of different monsters on it. There was also a giant whirlpool at the bottom of the Indian Ocean on it.

“Weird, but it’s probably just some decoration,” I said and handed it back to him.

“I don’t know man, let’s take it with us too,” he said and rolled It back up. I didn’t care much about the map as I did the helmet. We jogged back over to our sailboat and got back on, getting our phones from a storage compartment next to the captain’s chair.

“Wait, how did I forget, we don’t even have service out here,” Nathan said as he looked at his phone. He then switched to the camera app.

“I’m still gonna take pictures, this is the craziest thing I’ve ever seen,” he said as he begin doing that. I pulled out my phone and also started doing the same.

“So what do you think caused it?” I asked.

“Hell, Davy Jones’s Kraken? I don’t see how any force could rip a boat in half like that.”

“A waterspout?”

“We’ve had no storms in weeks. What if it was like a bomb?”

“Really?”

“I mean look at that helmet, it looks like some important tech. Maybe they were carrying other high-end stuff like that and something exploded?”

“Hmmm, the coast guard will probably be better detectives than us. Let’s start going back.”

We stopped taking pictures and cast off from the atoll. Once we started going back towards Maui, our reception returned. But before I could call anyone, Nathan stopped the boat and started talking to me.

“Wait a second. I think we should keep the helmet ourselves.”

“Keep the helmet? You really think the coast guard wouldn’t take it for evidence?”

“Only if we tell them we found it.”

I realized now what he was implying.

“No way, I’m not gonna steal something I don’t even know what it is. Not to mention stealing is wrong in the first place.”

“Oh come on Sione. How many times did we steal stuff when we were younger?”

Nathan was right. During our teenage years, he and I had a knack for getting into trouble. We often frequently shoplifted from gas stations and Walmarts, with booze being our favorite choice. But after a few harsh endings with the cops, I became a completely different person. I thought Nathan had grown up too, but maybe I had been wrong.

“We were kids then, and this is way bigger than any of that,” I said after a pause.

“I don’t have the kind of money you do, and that thing looks like it could be sold for a lot.”

“Bro, who would you even sell it to? Are you a dark web user now? If it’s really that important the FBI would find you anyway.”

Nathan stared off into the water.

“Ok, what if we kept it for just a day or two? You know, tell them that we forgot to report it and left it on the boat or some bullshit like that.”

I looked down at the helmet again, studying it hard. Attached to the top of it were two flashlights, and I noticed an opening in the front where I presumed a breathing tube would enter it. That’s when I figured it had to be an advanced diving suit.

“I think this is a diving suit of some sort,” I brought the idea up to Nathan.

“That’d make sense considering we found it on a boat,” he replied sarcastically.

I sighed and pulled out my phone, calling the coast guard and reporting the crash. Once we arrived back in Maui, Nathan and I headed to my place and waited to hear about it on the news, but nothing ever came up. I thought that was super strange considering how odd it all was. The more I spent time studying the helmet, the more intrigued I became. Nathan was more fascinated by the map, which I still thought was nothing. Once it got to about 5’o’clock, I figured my wife would be coming home soon.

“Still nothing on the news about the yacht. Surely the coast guard has got to have gotten out there by now?” Nathan said as he flipped through the channels.

“Maybe they’re still looking for survivors or something,” I said, taking a bite of an apple.

“What if it’s some crazy coverup that we got involved in?” He smiled widely as he talked.

“Then we shouldn’t be involved. Look, Lilly is back at home and I don’t want her knowing about this. I think we should turn the helmet over in a few days. I just want to study it a little first.”

“You’ve lost your edge man, you need to pull that giant stick out of your ass,”

“Hey, no need to be so disrespectful.”

“Whatever, I’m keeping the map to myself though, and doing some research on it. You sure you don’t want me to take the helmet?”

“I wanna take a closer look at it.”

“See you soon,” he said and got up, his smile gone. I knew I had upset him with this, but I knew I was doing the right thing. Not long after he left, my wife returned home. We had been together for eight years, and she was just as beautiful as the day I met her. I still remembered that night. Nathan at the time was engaged, and I hadn’t had any luck with girls really. I was supposed to go on a date that night with a girl I had met online, but she stood me up. After waiting on her for about an hour, I gave up and went to join Nathan and his fiancé Maggie at a bar. And at that bar was the girl with another guy. I got wasted that night and ended up leaving behind Nathan and Maggie and walking the beach alone, stumbling around. I passed out in the sand and awoke to a young blonde girl with dark green eyes. I knew right then and there that she was the one, and things had been perfect ever since. Within a few years, we were engaged, married, and had a baby daughter on the way. That night at dinner, she questioned me about my day off. I had hidden the helmet in my car, not wanting her to see it. I didn’t know if she would truly care, but I didn’t want to run any risk of upsetting her.

“So, how was your day with Nathan?” She asked

“Oh it was fine, we went out to our old atoll, did a little bit of fishing,” I replied

“It’s been a while since I’ve been out there. How bout we go sailing out there together on your next day off?”

“Of course. We could bring some wine and make it a picnic. But you know, it’s been so long since we’ve left the islands. And our anniversary is coming up. I’ve been looking at places, and I was thinking maybe South America…”

“Sione, you know we can’t leave Faith here like that,” she interrupted me.

“We could just hire a babysitter for a few days.”

“You know how I feel about that, I only trust you and me to take care of her,” she said, standing up from the dinner table to put her plate in the sink.

“I understand yeah, but all I’m saying is I’d like some time for just you and to get away from all this stress, go on an adventure like when we first started dating.”

“You know that’s not realistic anymore, with a family comes a lot more responsibility. And you know one day when she’s older, we’ll all take trips together,” She looked back and smiled softly, and I felt warmth in my chest. That night, however, I couldn’t stop thinking about the shipwreck, map, and helmet. Long after Lilly had fallen asleep, I lay awake hoping to receive a text from Nathan. And around 1 AM, my phone buzzed.

*You up? \`*

It was a text from Nathan.

*Yeah.*

I simply texted back.

*Ok good. Call me right now. I’ve gotten some juicy shit on that map.*

I looked back to Lilly before quietly slipping out of bed. We lived in a two-story white house, with a large living room with big glass walls. They had a door that led out to a wooden deck. And this wooden deck led out to the dock and a private beach. It was a little windy outside, and our palm trees were swaying gently back and forth. The sounds of birds, the wind, and waves lapping against the sand eased my mind. It was a full moon and bright, but unfortunately with the light pollution from Honolulu, I couldn’t see many stars. I unlocked my phone and called Nathan. It only took a few rings before he answered.

“Yo.”

“Hey, Nathan, what you got?”

“So the language on this map, it’s greek! How weird is that? And the monsters on it are from the Odyssey. You know much about that?”

“Not really, isn’t some big poem?”

“Actually it’s like an epic. It was written by this dude Homer and talks about this other dude Odysseus who gets lost on the way back from the Trojan War.”

“That all sounds interesting, but I still think it was just a decorative map.”

“Well if it is they got a lot of things wrong. That giant whirlpool at the bottom of the Indian Ocean is labeled ‘The daughter of Poseidon’. But a daughter of Poseidon would be like a demigod, not a whirlpool.”

“It was probably cheaply made then. Look I’ve done some thinking. And I want to turn the helmet over tomorrow to authorities. It’s the right thing to do.”

“Sione wait…”

I heard footsteps approaching behind me and whirled around to see Lilly walking out to me.

“Is everything ok Sione?” She asked. In the moonlight, she looked gorgeous.

“Yeah, it’s Nathan. He just couldn’t sleep,” I replied.

“Ok, I’m just checking.”

She turned around and headed back inside. I didn’t know how much she had actually heard, but I didn’t want to be any more suspicious.

“Hey, I’ll talk to you tomorrow,” I said and hung the phone up. Once I got back into bed, Lilly rolled over towards my side. She opened her mouth to say something but was interrupted by a loud scream, a scream that came from the baby monitor on the nightstand. The screaming was followed by a loud crying, and we were up and running to Faith’s room within a second. I reached the doorway first, flung it open, and turned on the lights to see her crying loudly and standing up in her crib. Lilly ran over and picked her up out of the crib, beginning to comfort her right away.

“Shhh now, momma and dadda are here now, shhhhhh…”

I watched awkwardly, not sure what to do, but Faith was already beginning to calm down. She was 14 months old now, could walk a little, and say two words. I remember her first word, which she said around her one-year anniversary, was just simply “Ma.” And a month later, she was saying “Da” to me. It was her way of calling out to us. But it hadn’t been easy with her. Almost every night she woke us up crying on the baby monitor. Every morning I was exhausted, and sometimes deep down I wondered if Faith would be even worth all this trouble, and we didn’t even intend to have her. Our plan was to wait until we were a little older, and still have more time for ourselves. But the baby had taken up all of our time now. Anytime I thought like this, I did my best to try to repress these thoughts. The next day at work I was training some divers in the back of our facility. We had this super large and deep pool that could simulate waves, so it’s often where I took new

Divers to learn before getting in the actual ocean. But the entire time I couldn’t stop thinking about the oddity of the shipwreck.

When lunch came around I texted Nathan and agreed to meet him at The Black Flag. The Black Flag was the name of our favorite restaurant in the entire city. It was right up on the beach, open air, and under a thatched-roof cabana. It was also next to a popular surfing spot, and that provided plenty of entertainment. Watching the surfers go and sometimes wipe out. For many years I had tried it, but I could never get it down. Nathan on the other hand had been decent. When I got there I ordered a bacon cheeseburger combo, and took a seat right by the beach. It was a nice sunny day, with only a few clouds out. The beach and restaurant were alive with the sounds of laughter and people taking. Nathan however, did not show up. Instead, two men in suits quietly sat down at my table.

“Mr. Tupuola is it?” A bald man who looked to be in his 50s said.

“Uh yeah, nice to meet you?” I extended my hand out for a handshake, but they didn’t even acknowledge it. Just stared at me from behind their dark sunglasses. I immediately began to wonder if these people were here about the shipwreck and grew a little nervous.

“You can just call me Chapman,” the bald man said before continuing to speak.

“Well, how can I help you two?”

“Mr. Tupuola, you and your friend Nathan Wesker happened upon a crashed ship the other day on the atoll right? One you called the coast guard about?”

“We did.”

“Well as it so happens that was a government ship. Part of an organization that we work for. And there was some property on it that was very important to us. When we searched the site didn’t see any sign of it. You wouldn’t have happened to have taken anything from the site would you?”

I opened my mouth to tell them about the helmet and the map but paused. Something about these guys didn’t sit right with me.

“What government organization are y’all a part of exactly?” I questioned.

“That’s classified,” Chapman replied quickly.

“Well how can I trust you then?”

“Mr. Tupuola, stealing government property is a very serious crime that could have very serious consequences. If you gave it to us now, we’d be willing to let it slide.”

“Give what? What do you think I took?”

“We can’t say.”

I didn’t reply, just silently studied them. The tension was broken by a cheerful waitress approaching our table.

“Hey guys! Would you two like to try our new Hawaiian Mimosa special? We have a brand new recipe and it’s on sale…”

“No thank you,” Chapman bluntly interrupted her without taking his eyes off of me.

“Well, I can take your order whenever you’re ready!”

“We’re good.”

The waitresses’ smile faded into a solemn frown.

“Okkkk then, I’ll be back in a few minutes.”

Chapman waited until she was out of earshot and then leaned in forward to me.

“We know you’re lying Tupuola. We already braced your buddy Nathan, and he told us everything.”

Calmly I reached into my back pocket, pulled out my wallet, pulled a twenty out of it, and laid it on the table.

“Am I under arrest?” I asked, my eyes darting between the two of them. They both glanced at each other before looking back at me. Chapman shook his head no.

“Well I must be going then, gotta get back to work,” I said and stood up before walking away without looking back. In could feel them staring me down as I walked off. As soon I was out of the restaurant I was speed walking to my car and frantically dialing Nathan. It went through all the rings before going to voicemail. As I approached my Tesla I tried again and again but received no answer.

*Hey man, I need you to call me right away. It’s pretty urgent.*

I texted him before starting up the car and driving off. But as I was leaving the parking lot a new worry hit me hard.

*Lilly and Faith!*

Quickly I was calling my wife but received no answer either. Normally I avoided texting while driving but this time I felt like it was justified.

*Hey Lilly, I’m just trying to check in on you and Faith. I’ve taken the rest of the day off of work and decided maybe we could spend it together, so call me back.*

Normally I wasn’t one for speeding, but this time I was pushing it to about ten over. I didn’t want to risk getting pulled over and being delayed getting home. Honolulu’s traffic was always bad, but the restraint was only about 25 minutes from my house. On the way, I contacted my assistant manager, who actually answered my phone. I told him I had a family emergency and had to take the rest of the day off. They didn’t question any further. When I arrived I saw Lilly’s sedan in the driveway, and my worry grew even deeper. I opened up the glove box and pulled out a taser. I was never one to keep a gun for self-defense, as I didn’t want to ever seriously harm or kill anyone. I stepped out of the car, slipped the taser into my pocket, and slowly approached the front door. When I arrived I reached out and twisted the door handle. It was unlocked. Slowly, I opened the door. I reached my hand into my pocket as my eyes swept across the living room and kitchen. Nothing seemed to be out of place. The first room I went to was Faith’s. She wasn’t in her crib. Next, I moved to Lily and I’s bedroom. It too was empty. My eyes fell on two gold medals hanging next to the closet door, and my mind was pulled elsewhere for a second. But I quickly snapped out of it when I noticed Lily’s phone sitting on her nightstand. I picked it up, eyeing the missed call and text notifications from me. My worry began to evolve into panic as I ran back downstairs.

“Lilly!” I screamed. I frantically looked around, breathing heavily.

“Lilly! Where are you!”

And then I stopped. Out through the window, I could see our hammock slowly rocking back and forth. And sitting in it was the backside of my wife. Hurriedly I opened the sliding glass door and almost jogged out to her.

“Lily!” I yelled as I came up behind her. She almost jumped in reaction before turning around to face me.

“Oh Gosh, you scared the heck out of me!”

She was holding Faith in her arms. By some miracle, she hadn’t woken up either.

“Sorry, it’s just I was worried about you. You didn’t answer your phone.”

“I’ve been out here with Faith for a while. Did you take the day off of work?”

“I did.”

“Oh good! Maybe we can do something fun then.”

I swallowed hard as I looked past her and to the water. Lying was something I hated doing to everyone, something I always tried to avoid. I prided myself on being an honest man. And now I was gonna have to lie to the person who mattered most to me.

“Uh Lilly, I don’t think it’s safe for you and Faith to be here right now.”

She frowned at me, and I continued to avoid eye contact.

“Some men came by at work today. Sketchy-looking men who wanted money. I told them to get lost of course, but just in case they know where I live and try to do something…”

Lilly scrunched her face into a look of anxiety.

“Oh my gosh Sione, you have to call the police!”

“I’m about to. I just had to rush home to make sure you were alright.”

“Were they just some random thugs? Or did they look even more dangerous than that?”

“They looked dangerous dangerous. I wouldn’t be surprised if these guys were part of some higher crime organization. That’s why I want to make sure you are safe tonight.”

“What about you? You should come with me.”

“No No, I’m gonna stay here. The police will probably leave an unmarked vehicle here overnight also. I’ll probably be fine, but I can’t risk anything ever happening to you or Faith,” I said as my eyes wandered over to my sleeping daughter. Lilly looked off for a little bit as if to contemplate what I was saying.

“Sione this is a lot. We just got this house a year ago, and I don’t want everything to be upheavaled, to have to get a whole new identity and everything.”

“Don’t worry, it won’t be like that.”

I reached out and hugged her, squeezing tightly. And at that moment I was comforted too. After that, we all three went back inside and Lilly began to pack her things. Grace was her younger sister, and she lived basically on the other side of Honolulu with her husband Joey. He was a good guy and I had always enjoyed going over to their place. I knew they would understand. On the way out I hugged and kissed her once more. I just hoped it wouldn’t be my last time seeing her.

“Be safe,” she called out to me as she started up her car.

“I will.”

I tried to reassure her, but even I wasn’t so sure of my fate. After she left, I began trying to contact Nathan once again. But as the hours went by I still heard no word from hIm. I considered calling the police; but if these were actually government agents, then it would probably do me more harm than good. I decided not to leave the house the rest of the day, and stayed inside and just watched basketball the whole time. For dinner, I ordered just a pepperoni pizza to the house. Before eating I sent up a quick prayer for my family and I. As the sun set and night crept in, I grew more anxious. If they were gonna make a move on me, it would probably be under the cover of darkness. I also figured they would wait till late in the night. And by 9 PM, nothing significant had happened. Lilly and I had been in the talks about setting up a camera in the driveway and front yard for security but hadn’t gotten around to it. Crime in my neighborhood was incredibly low, and up until now, I had never felt like we were in any danger. But a new idea began to formulate in my head. I had left the helmet in the car this whole time so they wouldn’t find It if they broke in. But now I was thinking:

*Why not just hide in the car myself? And watch the house the whole time?*

So at about 9:30 I grabbed my tablet and headed out to my Tesla, bringing the taser with me. It was parked in our driveway, but I moved it out of it and parked it further down the road on a hill. With a pair of binoculars I also brought out, I could easily see my house. I had shut every light off in the house, and it looked like no one was home with both me and Lily’s cars being gone. I had decided to leave the door unlocked, however. As I’d rather not have to pay to fix a door that had been broken into. As the night drew on, I felt myself getting more and more tired. I considered going in and getting some caffeine but didn’t want to risk it. Cars had been driving down and up the road all night, but none of them looked or acted suspicious. By the time midnight had come and passed, I was fighting off falling asleep. But around 1 AM, I noticed a black SUV drive down the hill and slow as it approached my house. Once it reached the driveway, it turned into it and quickly shut off its engine.

*This has gotta be those guys*

I pulled out my binoculars and began to observe them. It took about a minute for the car doors open, but three big men stepped out when they did. Instead of suits like the guys at lunch, they were wearing almost combat-like gear. In the night I could barely make out pistol holsters on their waist. They all approached the door, and one of the men knocked. I expected Chapman to be one of the men, but he wasn’t with them as far as I could tell. After only about ten seconds of no one answering, he reached for the door handle. The door opened and all three of the men stepped in. I had purposely left the curtains open so I could see what they would do. At first, they went through the kitchen, searching everywhere. And then next, the living room. They opened every door and drawer in the house. But they were careful not to make my mess. After searching downstairs they ascended the stairs, but I didn’t get to watch much longer after that. A knocking on the side of my car jolted me out of my concentration. A wave of fear hit me as I looked up and saw another similarly dressed man, aiming a gun at me, just outside the door.

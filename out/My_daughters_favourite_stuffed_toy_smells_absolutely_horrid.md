I'm a single dad who lives with my 7 year old daughter I'll call Lana. She is a sucker for anything stuffed. She has a bunch of different stuffed dogs, cats, rabbits, you name it. But her absolute favorite was a fluffy pink teddy bear she got for her 5th birthday. 

She named him "Mr.S". No clue what the S stands for. She carries around Mr.S everywhere she goes. Since the day she turned 5 you cannot catch her without it. Sometimes when my wife and I were together, we would have to sneak it from Lana in her sleep to wash it. She wouldn't break away from this bear, ever. 


But I started noticing something odd a month ago, my daughter would talk to her teddy bear. Yes, she's a child and children do this kinds of odd things, but she wouldn't talk to Mr.S in the way you would think. She would speak absolute gibberish and praise the bear as if it were God. My family isn't religious, but this was freaking me the fuck out. I didn't know what to think of the situation, but I let it be as she wasn't hurting anyone including herself. 

This wasn't Lana's only quirk, though. Recently, she started collecting dead animals that she found outside. She wouldn't show them to me, instead trot them to her room and slip them to wherever she kept them. I'll find random skulls of animals around the house, with an assortment of other bones scattered wherever they could be. I've asked her about it once, and she said "He likes it when I bring him gifts!" with a childlike chuckle. I didn't ask anything else. I passed it off like it was a normal kid thing to say. 

But as the title says, Mr.S has started to smell awful. I work at a landfill and even I have never smelled something so awful. I tried sneaking her teddy to wash it, but when I go into her room at night I can't find it. Though some how she always exits her with the teddy in her arms. 

The smell is awful, unbearable, but I can't get rid of it. I've never smelled anything like it. If I had to describe it, it smells like rotten pig flesh, but even that smell isn't as unbelievably awful. I don't want to ask my girl about it, because she may take it in a bad way. She's only seven, so why not let her keep some of her imagination? 

But the thing at freaks my out the most, is something I found last night. For background, you'll have to understand the way my daughters room is set up. Her bed is in a corner and she has a giant rug in the middle of her room. It has sparkles and unicorns on it, typical 7 year old her shit. Other than that, she has her toys in various parts of her room with a giant pile of her favorite plushies.

Well, I was cleaning up around her room the other night, and while I was sweeping one of the shoes to her dolls swept under her rug. I lifted up the rug to grab it, and decided to check for other miscellaneous toy bits. When I lift up the rug, I see a giant pentagram written in what looks to be red ink. I take a few steps back and stumble in fear. What the fuck is wrong with my daughter? Why the fuck would she have something like this? 

I go later that evening to pick up my daughter from my ex-wifes house. I see her perky and cuddling Mr.S in her arms. Her teddy is a bit pinker than last time I saw it, but I say nothing a plop her in my car.

As we're backing up she says, "DADDY, DADDY! I LEFT CHEWY INSIDE!" Chewy is the name of one of her plushies. Her moms as standing in the doorway so I allowed her to hop out of the car and go grab her plushie. 

I notice she left Mr.S, so I pick him up to investigate. He was wet and when I shook it, it made a raddling sound. A bit of what looked to be blood got on my hand as I put him down. My child is 7 years old. Why does one of her plushies have blood on it? And enough for it to be wet? 

She came back with her plushie and slipped into her booster seat. I wish I could say the rest of the drive was somewhat normal, but she started spewing gibberish at her teddy. I couldn't tell what she was saying, but it was praise. 

I took her home, plopped her in her bed, and kissed her goodnight. A few hours later when I came back to check on her before I headed to bed, Mr.S was gone. Not a trace in the world, like he disappeared.

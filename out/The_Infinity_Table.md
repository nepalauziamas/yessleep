I've been an artist for a few years now. I went to school with people whose understanding of art stopped at watercolors and still lifes, but those were never for me. I liked to be experimental in my work, really pushing the boundaries of art. My High School art teacher, Mr. Kaff, never understood it, but it's probably hard to understand much of anything with your head crammed up your backside. He was one of those types who thought the renaissance was the birth and the death of artistic expression and that digital art was tantamount to blasphemy. He did not tolerate modern art in his classroom, and I likely wouldn't still be doing art if it wasn't for Terry.

Terry and I met in art class freshman year, and we've been friends ever since. Terry is your textbook manic pixie dream girl, and her artistic medium is pop art with a soft spot for comics. She did all these reimaginings of classic comic covers, always in heavy oils and deep, saturated colors, and her work is really something to behold. Mr. Kaff may not have understood her medium, but he understood her process, so she made straight B's in his class. I have a theory that he was also trying to get into her ripped blue jeans, but manic pixie dream girls rarely fall for middle-aged high school teachers so tough break, teach.

The old bastard tried to fail me, but I rose above it, and now I'm one of the most well-known artists in the city, likely to his chagrin.

My art is far from what you'd consider classical. I make sculptures from various mediums, do charcoal prints, weird displays of paints and acrylics, and recently I've begun doing metalwork sculptures and something I'm calling Transitory Mundane. The basic premise is that you take something normal, a refrigerator or a couch or a tv, and make it utterly mindblowing. My horror fridge took first at last year's fall gala, and my TVpocalispe made the paper earlier this year. 

This time, however, I've got something really interesting.

Terry raised an eyebrow as I pulled the cover off my latest art project.

"I call it the Infinity Table."

Terry looked dubiously at the rectangular living room table, a thick piece of glass sitting propped over a dark opening.

"It just looks like a regular table to me. I'm not sure what kind of concept you're going for, but I don't get it."

I grinned as I leaned down, flicking a switch as the inside lit up to reveal the trick. Through mirror placement and strategic lighting, the inside of the table resembled nothing so much as a black pit that proceeded downward into infinity. A ladder was installed on the side and seemed to descend down into the pit, the mirrors magnifying it on and on into the void. Terry's jaw dropped open, and she oooed appreciatively over the illusion, the rough walls and the lighted crystals adding a nice touch if I do say so myself. 

"That is so cool. It's so simple yet intriguing. Everyones going to want one after the show next week."

"But only one of them will get it. I think this may be my greatest piece yet."

The two of us cackled over my brilliance, and Terry told me about the panel series she planned to do for her own entry. Terry had been hard at work on an original comic series, so tired of bringing others' work to life and not getting to work on her own. She was debuting a series of oil paintings from her own personal collection, and she hoped they would drum up some interest for the upcoming series.

I was listening, really I was, but my eyes kept being drawn back down to that yawning chasm that lay in the center of the table. It was an illusion, I knew it was an illusion, but I couldn't keep myself from feeling that sightless black eye as it stared at me. It had discomforted me before, the way a scary movie makes you shiver even after it's over, but I had always managed to shrug it off. I had created the illusion, I knew it wasn't real, but I could still swear that something lurked within it. I knew it didnâ€™t, but it still intrigued me.

Like a bird that knows the bag will trap him, but still wants to know what lies inside.

Like a man who knows that the void stares back but goes on staring. 

"Hello? Are you even listening to me?"

I shook myself back and apologized for spacing out. I flipped the light out and the table was once again reduced to a black crater. Even turned off, I still felt like I could feel that inky mass looking at me, and I didn't like the crawling, scrabbling way it seemed to contemplate me.

"It's cool and all, but I'm kinda glad you turned it off."

I looked up as Terry shuddered, and the discomfort was an alien concept on her normally whimsical face.

"It scares me a little bit."

I smiled, but I knew all too well what she meant.

That's why Terry was my best friend; it was sometimes like we shared a brain.

"How did you even come up with something like this?" she asked, still sounding equal parts terrified and amazed.

I started to rattle off something about "pure talent" or "the muse at work" but I honestly couldn't remember how I had thought of this. Had it been a dream? It seemed like I had been inspired by something to build this piece, but I couldn't remember what. I had been so driven the last few weeks to finish it, that I had never actually stopped to ask why. 

"Hello? You spaced out on me again." Terry laughed, snapping her fingers in front of my face.

I shook myself, getting a grip, before answering, "Just the Muse at Work I  guess."

I took her out for drinks then, wanting to forget about the feeling that dark eye had given me as much as she did, but it was never far from my mind.

When I stumbled back that night, a few drinks turning into a few too many drinks, I stood over the table and looked down into the dark, unlit eye. Even drunk, I felt the regard of that hateful space, and it sobered me. I could feel it staring at me through the filmy haze that lay between us, and the dark hole seemed to long for its freedom again.

I reached for the switch with a shaky hand, the mechanism snapping crisply as it came to life.

The light came on, but it was cold comfort. 

The hole stretched into the earth, a dark and gaping maw that filled me with dread. Why had I created this thing? How had it occurred to me to make such a hateful portal? Had I....how had I conceptualized this?

The longer I looked into it, the more certain I became that I could see something towards the bottom.

It seemed to move within that dark eye with frantic, hurky-jerky movements. It moved like something in a claymation cartoon, and its regard was like wasps crawling on me. I didn't know what it was, I couldn't even tell you how big it was, but as my hands tremored back towards the switch, I was sure of one thing.

It had begun to climb the ladder.

The light snapped off with a smart pop, and I was left once more with only the dark haze across the glass.

I went to bed, but my dreams were plagued by that bottomless eye and that thing that moved within.

I didn't turn it on again until the show.

I debated just pushing it into the alley behind my apartment and forgetting it had ever existed, but I had too much time and money invested in the project to just walk away. The components hadn't come without a cost and the prize money, not to mention the money I would make once I sold the table, would allow me to do art for another few months, or so I hoped. If it flopped at the show, I might have to actually find a job, and that would be the biggest blow to the art community imaginable. 

So I loaded it into the back of my ratty little pickup, the camper allowing it to ride in relative safety, and drove it to the Gallery. I had secured it with rope, not wanting it to tip over and break despite my misgivings. I could tell myself that I kept checking the rearview the whole way there so I could make sure it didn't get damaged, but that was a lie.

I wanted to make sure that nothing simply climbed out of it as I drove through the crowded streets of Seattle to what I hoped would be a feather in the cap of my career. 

My neighbor had helped me load the table (beefy neighbors have to be good for something, right?), and thankfully there were burly men in black security shirts to help me unload it. They did most of the unloading and reloading onto a handy dolly too, which was good because it had taken everything I had to put my hands on it as we loaded it into the truck. 

It had sat like a revered monolith in my living room for the past week. After I had woken up that first morning to a hangover and the sunlight illuminating the pit under than all too thin pane of glass, I had covered it with a tarp. I hadn't touched it, hadn't sat anything on it, hadn't even let my feet lean against it that whole week, and the thought of its surface against my skin made me feel crawly. I couldn't remember why I had been so excited about this thing, and only a feeling of deep revulsion filled me when I looked at it.

If no one bought it, I had decided I would donate it to the Gallery after the show.

At least I could write that off on my taxes.

Terry waved at me as she saw me coming in and her little bird arms seemed ready to pop as she wrapped them around me.

"I see you didn't just get rid of it," she said with a smile, though her voice sounded strained.

Terry wouldn't say so, but she seemed to feel the same trepidation I  felt around the piece.

"I figured that someone would buy it and, who knows, the judges might really like it."

She showed me her prints, scenes of dramatic heroes poised for battle, and spiraling cityscapes that oozed adventure, and I made the appropriate noises over them. It was always impressive what she could do with oils and paints, but tonight she had really outdone herself. I gave her another hug, wishing her luck, as I pushed my hateful table over to the area they had designated for me.

A passing pair of lost fratboys helped me get it off the dolly and far too soon I was left alone with my blight upon the world. I didn't turn it on, I honestly didn't really want to look at it, and just contented myself to stand there as people bustled by and set up their own pieces for the show.

Twenty minutes later, my mind wandering, someone called my name and I turned to find a stern-faced woman looking down at my piece.

"What is it?" she asked, a ribbon on her shirt letting me know that though she wasn't a judge she was still very important.

The ribbon let everyone know that she was a contributor, the color putting her in the high tier.

"I call it an Infinity Table," I told her, her scowl not impressed.

I reached down, my fingers trembling, and flipped the switch. I expected to see an angry something looking back at me, the glass baring long cracks where something had battered it from the other side, but instead, it was just the same dark eye as always. It regarded the two of us with an unfriendly familiarity, and the stern-faced woman looked impressed as she took it all in.

"Very interesting. Not my style, but very interesting. You should leave it on if you want anyone to buy it. The endless tunnel is a definite selling point." 

I waited for her to move away before switching it off again. She'd had a point. If I wanted to get rid of this hateful thing, I needed people to see what it could do. The fear of something climbing out of it seemed silly now as all these people stood around me, but it was a silly feeling that wouldn't abate.

In the end, my greed overrode my fear, and I flipped it on so I could draw in some interest.

Interest I found.

People came over to have a look, and there was a fair amount of oooing and ahhhing. They asked me how I'd done it, wanting one of their own, but I told them it was a one-of-a-kind piece and would likely carry a steep price tag. All the while, my eyes kept flitting back to the crevice in the center of the table as though I expected to see something crawl up from the depths. I could see, or at least I imagined I could see, that stunted figure as he stalked about at the bottom of the pit. It was trapped there, this was its prison, and now I had given it a means of escape. I had invited it out of its pit, and now it could come up into our world and...

"Wow, how did you ever come up with such a cool concept?"

I started, someone new had come up to ask about the infinity table and I told them again about the concept. It all sounded so false to me now. I hadn't come up with the concept, though I could certainly talk about it in an educated manner. What a smart little bird I was. I could talk oh so prettily about my new project, using all the right buzz words and trendy lingo to catch all these yuppies' attention.

I was an artist, I created art, but this was beginning to feel like something else.

This was beginning to feel like being used.

Despite these misgivings, the show was going very well. People loved the infinity table. They thought it was really cool and a great perspective piece. I had a few tentative offers, but nothing serious. I would have probably taken the first serious offer I was given, but the hole in the table kept distracting me. 

As I talked to people, I could see the small something beginning to climb the ladder. It was still very small, like a fly crawling on a windowpane, but as it climbed, it got larger and larger with each rung it grabbed. There was no way this could be real. I had built this thing! There was no hole in the void, it was all an optical illusion! Even so, the small creature was climbing up and up and up as these stupid airheads talked on and on about how much they loved the table.

"Hey, you okay?"

I jumped, realizing I had been staring at the table for nearly five minutes.

Terry was there, a well-dressed man grinning on her arm. Terry wasn't tall, but this guy looked like he might have some Hobbits in his family tree. He was short, hairy, dressed in a luxurious white suit with a gold chain and a lot of very aggressive chest hair. I wasn't certain I could smell him, there were a lot of sweaty bodies (mine chief amongst them), but there was a definite tang of musky cologne and fragrant soap.

Terry was smiling, but the smile looked paper-thin as the man, whom I was already calling Leasure Suit Larry in my head, rubbed his arm against her hip.

"This is Clive," she said, indicating Larry as she slid herself free of him, "He liked my art so much that he decided to buy all five pieces. I just knew he had to see your infinity table so I brought him over to have a look."

Translation: Leasure Suit Larry was Loaded and she was hoping he could solve both of our money problems.

Larry had sized me up as she spoke and I could feel my skin crawl under his less than altruistic stare.

"I consider myself a lover of art, amongst other things. Did you make this?" he asked, looking down into the table as his eyes seemed to dazzle as they took in the sight of that gaping pit.

"I did," I began, but before I could say anything else, I looked down at the table and felt my throat constrict. He was bigger now, the size of a thumbprint, and climbing fast. He was speeding up, climbing rapidly, and I wasn't sure how the other two couldn't see him. Did they not see the shadowy little creature as it grew from a thumbprint to the size of a silver dollar? Larry was saying something, complimenting my work, but all I could focus on was the growing spot of black as it climbed like a mad thing. 

"I'm sold, love." he said to Terry, the word love making her flinch, "I'll pay you thirty thousand for it."

I couldn't speak. My throat was a stupid machine incapable of doing anything but killing me slowly. The thing was twice as large now and growing quickly. I had no clue what I would do if it got to the glass and just started banging at the thin sheet of tempered material. Larry was looking right at it, his nose inches from the tabletop. How could he not see it?

"Playing hard to get, huh? Okay, forty thousand then."

I could make out the top of its head, its face turned up to look at the land above. Its eyes were like twin coals, its mouth opens in a leering grin, and its hands were covered with hair or tar or something. Its body was like an undulating shadow, a golem of darkness that was climbing like a fiend to get at the lighted world above. 

It seemed like I might have unintentionally created performance art, I thought with a weak little gasp.

Escape from purgatory in real-time.

Terry slid her hand into mine, and squeezed, bringing me out of my panic.  

"What's wrong?" she whispered, seeing my face and sensing my fear.

"You are a tease, aren't you?" Larry said, looking up from the table coyly, "Fine, but fifty thousand is as high as I'll go unless you agree to have drinks with me after the show. Then I might be willing to go up to sixty thousand."

"Sold," I barked out, afraid that he would take it all back and leave me with this thing.

He extended a hand over the top of the table.

As I shook it, I could see the creature's face coming closer and closer to the top of the table. 

I pumped his arm twice before bending down to snap the light off.

"Can you take it now?" I asked him, my voice sounding frantic even to my own ears.

"Don't you want the judges to see it?" Terry asked, confused. The panel of three judges were just coming to the display area for my category, but I didn't want this thing close to me for one more second. To hell with the judging, the fear inside me was like a starving weasel and I feared it would burst through my chest any minute.

"Can you?" I asked again, looming over him.

He nodded dumbly, taking out his checkbook and scrawling out a business check.

I took it, and he pulled out his cellphone as he made some calls.

He excused himself and before Terry could ask me too many questions, I pocketed the check and left the Gallery. 

I met her later for drinks, and she said that Larry had excused himself after purchasing my art piece. 

"He said he wanted to get it loaded and sent to his own exhibit right away. I think you scared him with your intensity a little." 

We laughed about it then, my soul lighter now that I didn't have to look at that hateful table anymore.

I hadn't thought about that table until yesterday, about a week and a half after the Gala. The check had been cashed and the money would easily float my art career for the next few years. I had paid some bills, paid my outstanding credit card debt, and began living pretty comfortably off the excess. 

I was sitting on my couch, watching Netflix, and eating a bowl of cereal when my phone buzzed.

It was Terry. She had sent me a news article, along with a message telling me that I should watch it. "You're art piece just made the news in New York," she told me, and the lack of emojis and lols made me a little warry. I opened it up to find an article about a murder at the gallery of Clive Foreman. The proprietor, Mr. Foreman, was found dead in his Gallery in Soho Tuesday morning. He appeared to have drowned though no water could be found in his lungs or on the ground around him. "Doctors say it's as though he simply drowned on the floor of his gallery and was left there." The next picture was of a very familiar table. It had been broken and the glass lay gaping and jagged like an untreated wound. The article went on to say that the murderer had left a message on the wall in either tar or some kind of oil, and as I scrolled to the next picture, I felt the phone slip out of my numb hand.

The message on the wall seemed to glower up at me from the floor, and I drew my knees to my chest as I tried to stop myself from hyperventilating.

It read, "Your muse is free. My prison is no more."

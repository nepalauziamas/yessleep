[Part II](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w4uvxx/three_people_died_in_the_woods_last_summer_and_im/)

I started scrambling to get up silently, but attempting to wake everybody up. I didn’t need to make much noise, everyone had already heard the howling and was startling awake.

“They saw us…through the roof!” I stammered… “it was just looking at us…I”

“I know,” the woman said, “they can get up there, but they’ve never been able to see me before…shit. I knew this could happen. I’ve been waiting for this.” The woman ran to the kitchen area of the cabin, grabbing two large bottles of alcohol with rags hanging out of them. She wrapped an arm around each one, pulling them close into her chest. She grabbed a lighter and put it in her pocket.

“What’s going on” Sloane asked, “where is that noise coming from?”

“There’s no time to explain, you all need to get in the bedroom” the woman demanded. She started pushing the refrigerator that was blocking the bedroom door out of the way. The three of us started helping her move the fridge. The door to the bedroom opened and we rushed in.

“There’s one window in there but it’s covered by that dresser” she said pointing to the side wall, – “its not safe to sleep in there, but just hide until day light, they aren’t around in the day. Move the dresser in front of the door after you shut it, and stay away from the window!”

“What…" I started but it was too late to ask questions. We heard the first thump on the roof, followed instantly by a second, third, fourth, and fifth. Then footsteps, slow and stealthy again just like before.

“Listen to me,” the woman was now holding on to my shirt collar, “you need to get out of here as soon as you can. Don’t wait in this cabin, I thought I could but it’s not safe. They’ll return again and will find you.”

Before I could fully take in what she was saying she slammed the door in my face. I could hear her moving the refrigerator back in front of the door. Hiding us. Saving us.

“Quick” I yelled to Trinity and Sloane, “we need to move the dresser in front of the door.” The three of started pushing the dresser towards the door, revealing a small window, about 2x2 feet.

We heard glass shattering from the skylight, followed by screeching.

“Not today you stupid ugly bastards!” the woman bellowed “no one messes with Lindsey you fucks! Come and get me!”

The sound of the front door swinging open was followed by a loud thump from the living room. Two more thumps. We could hear screaming, and running.

“Look!” Sloane yelled. She was staring out the window. I crawled over, just barely lifting my head above the sill to see outside. Lindsey was running. Fast. Two creatures were right behind her.

This was the first time I had seen them – it was still dark outside, but dawn was approaching and in the low light I could see the animals relatively clearly. Their bodies were large, like a big dog, with long forearms that they used to run just like a chimp, or gorilla. Their bodies were wiry, with patchy grey hair, and thick folds of skin along their arms, that almost looked like poorly designed wings when they stretched their arms forward. Slone had it exactly right: monkey wolves.

Suddenly the animals stopped. One squatted on its massive back legs and launched into the air. Lindsey turned around just in time to see this and stopped running. She crouched to the ground hugging her arms around her body. We could see her reaching into her pocket, pulling something out.

“What is she doing??” said Trinity, “why isn’t she running?”

Within seconds a creature had landed on her from out of nowhere. It launched Lindsey back into the sky almost the instant after it had touched down. Something was wrong though. The creature was in the air, trying to hold its grip on Lindsey while also spreading its semi winged arms to land but it was struggling. We could see them tussling above, like a pair of skydiver in the air fighting in a wrestling match. The creature tried to flap its arms and stabilize its body but it couldn’t. They both came crashing down to the ground, their impact followed by a massive explosion. They landed near the two other creatures that had been running right behind them, and the impact of the explosion flung their bodies. Flames burst and encompassed them, with only one creatures able to run out, looking injured but still alive.

We ducked from the window. We could still here noises from inside the cabin. We started to hear running as the remaining two creatures that were inside ran out to after the explosion. They approached the injured one, almost looking concerned. Its fur was burnt and it had a limp.

We watched again through the window, and realized it wasn't concern, but a look of curiosity. Within seconds they began devouring the injured animal, together as a team. They were ravenous in how they attacked it, even fighting each other at times as they tore the injured creature apart. Slonae and Trinity looked away. I tried to as well, but the creatures stopped fighting over the dead body, and looked up towards the sky. Dawn was breaking and the bright morning sun had come through. They ran for the cover of the thick, dense forest, paying little attention to the remaining bodies that they left lying in the remnants of the explosion.

We were stunned. We sat in silence.

“Somebody say something,” Sloane pleaded. Trinity’s eyes were welling with tears.

“What do we do?” Trinity asked.

“I don’t know” I responded, “but we can’t stay here.”

“What if they get us out there?” Sloane asked.

“They might,” I responded, “but there are only two left. I don’t think they can be out in the day time. I don’t know why, but that is what Lindsey said before she…” my voice trailed. I couldn’t finish the sentence, “all I know is that Lindsey said they didn’t come out in the day, and we all saw it too, they took off when the sun came up. I think they are afraid of it or something.”

“Yeah,” said Sloane, “at least that’s one thing we know about them, oh yeah, and that they are ruthless cannibals that will eat each other the second one has their guard down.”

Trinity stood up, alert.

“I have a plan!” she announced. Sloane and I listened to her plan intently.

It was time to go.

We pushed on the door as hard as we could. Slowly the fridge moved out of the way, and we squeezed out into the main room of the cabin. No one spoke, as we made a line for the kitchen. Without words we packed. Sloane grabbed one of the blankets and tied it into the shape of a sack, draped around her shoulder. We started to fill the sack with the only remaining food – two granola bars, a measly bag of vegan soy jerky, a ziplock bag of crushed pringles and one unopened can of pure pineapple juice.

“Can we just eat it now?” Trinity asked. Slone and I looked at each other and shrugged.

“I’m starving actually” Sloane said. We divided the food, and shoved it into our mouths almost as fast as those creatures had eaten their fallen friend. We were so hungry. Trinity’s eyes looked across the room where she had noticed the fishing pole. She looked at me, moth full of granola bar. Without a word I nodded in understanding. I had work to do, but first, we needed gas.

“So, we are making a sniper?” Trinity asked as we walked outside.

“A syphon” I corrected, her “we just need…hmm..uh..what do we need again?”

“A garden hose,” Sloane answered, “and the empty gallon sized container of apple juice in the kitchen.”

“And where did you learn how to do this again?” I asked, half amused, half confused.

“YouTube is free Max,” she responded, “I like to learn new skills.”

Sloane and Trinity went to work. They would syphon the gas from the car parked in the driveway with no keys, and use it to fill up the Bronco, parked at the end of the long driveway. I walked back to the house.

We had been awake for several hours by now, and I didn’t know how long my task would take. I grabbed the fishing pole and walked to the water. I grabbed the small boat, and rowed myself out a few hundred feet. I sat. I was pretty good at fishing, but I had no idea if there was even anything out in this lake. I had no idea if Trinity’s plan would even work, or if we would even need to use it. Time passed. What time was it anyways, I thought to myself. I had no idea, maybe high noon by now? We need to move faster. My fishing line sat motionless in the water. More time went by. I was staring off into the distance. Something caught my eye. Movement in the trees. My heart started to pound. Before I could make out anything I saw what looked like a person? A man? It looked like he was spying on the girls. He was gone back into the woods, disappearing as fast as he had appeared.

I grabbed the oars and started rowing back to shore. I walked towards the car; Trinity and Sloane were arguing. The area smelled like gasoline.

“Did you catch any fish?” Trinity asked.

“Nothing,” I responded, “any luck with the gas?”

“I think I did this wrong…” Sloane said, a pile of gas spilled around her, the gallon container was about ¾ of the way full.

“That’s enough, we need to leave.” I said.

“This won’t get us anywhere!” Sloane protested, “Shelby’s bronco gets like two miles to the gallon.”

“It will get us to the truck,” I said, “and then we can take that from there. The keys are still in it.”

“But we can’t leave without the fish!” said Trinity, “the plan won’t work without it.”

I looked around. I didn’t know what I had seen in the woods but something didn’t feel right. Was it a man? another creature? it had disappeared so fast, who would be out here?

I walked over to the carcass of the creature that had been torn to shreds. The animals hadn’t even finished eating when they took off. Unlike the other attacks, there was evidence of what had been killed here.

“Give me your pack,” I told Sloane. She handed me her makeshift blanket sling. I grabbed a huge piece what must have been part of the dead creature’s arm (leg maybe?) and wrapped in the sling. It was heavy, and covered in blood.

“Ew” Trinity and Sloane said in unison.

“Will this work for the plan?” I asked.

Trinity smiled at me. “Definetly.”

We walked to the bronco. Carefully. We made a 360 around the car, peering into the vehicle.

“It stinks” Trinity said.

“I know” I responded, “it smells like something died in here." We opened the front door and the stench overcame us. The inside was covered in blood. The pack must have killed the creature that we locked in here, its hands still slammed in the back door.

“Okay,” said Sloane, “give me the gas!” We filled the car with every drop. We piled into the smelly capsule, and I started the engine.

“It’s working!” I shouted. Trinity and Sloane screamed with delight. So far so good. We were halfway through our plan. I turned the car around and started heading back on the road. We were driving as fast as we could, but also trying to save gas.

“The truck should be just around the corner” I thought to myself. “Where is that thing?”

“How long until we get to the truck?” Trinity asked, it always seemed like they could read my mind when things were going bad. I felt the pit in my stomach again. I didn’t recognize any of the road, but we had to be driving in the right direction. There was just one road. I started to get a little frantic. Our silence was broken by a ‘ding’ of the low gas light coming on again. I groaned. Then up ahead, around a corner, I saw it. The truck.

“It’s there!” I screamed. The girls cheered. I slammed on the breaks. Just behind the truck, standing in the middle of the road blocking me from being able to pass was a tall, blonde man, with clear blue eyes. He wore dirty overalls, with the strap hanging off on one side, large black rain boots, and a wide brimmed woven hat that was tearing from ware at the edges. We froze in silence.

He looked directly at us. He had a large black cane in his hand, like a walking stick but with some kind of electronic looking prong and antennae at the top.

“Now, y’all aren’t leaving so soon are you?” he asked. We just stared at him.

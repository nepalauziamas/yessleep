“Are you taking me to a shitty underground clinic so that you can traffic me on the black market?” I asked as Myron opened the door, allowing the faint scent of piss and loneliness to wash over us. 

He grinned at me. “If I were going to do that, Aima, it would have happened ten times over by now.”

I didn’t smile back. “Is that supposed to comfort me?” I snapped while following him through the dank hallway. 

“Doesn’t it?” he responded. “Look, I promise that you’re not in any danger, as long as you don’t tell anyone what you’re about to see.”

I clutched my arms close to my body. “You know that I’m only doing this because I’ll get kicked out of school if I can’t come up with 10K to pay for next semester, right?”

“Which makes you perfect,” he finished, stopping before another door. 

“I’m not even a doctor yet, Myron. That’s still a year away,” I answered, looking around anxiously. 

“It’s a year away for me as well,” he responded in a voice that he thought was smooth. “Fortunately, we’re more than sufficient for what these people need.”

Every instinct told me to turn around, to run away and never look back. But the math was simple: if I dropped out of school, my entire life’s plans would be ruined, leaving me five figures in debt and zero job prospects. 

So I followed him through the door and was hit by a smell of formaldehyde so overwhelming that I didn’t realize he was locking it behind me until too late.

My mouth went so dry that I couldn’t form words. 

We were either in a very primitive operating room or a very modest butcher shop. Low lamps buzzed over a concrete floor that was interspersed with rusty drains. At the very center was a man strapped to a table. His arms and legs were restrained at his sides, and his mouth was gagged, but his eyes were very, very active. He looked all around the room, lingering at Myron, then at me. He was clearly panicked. 

“We don’t have much time,” a man huffed as he stepped out from the shadows. His suit looked expensive, and he had the kind of air that made it clear he reserved no interest for any person who had the audacity to challenge his belief that he shat ice cream. “You brought a second?”

“This is Aima,” Myron offered with a dismissive gesture toward me. He rolled up his sleeves and made a beeline for a nearby sink. “I read the donor description, but decided she needed to see this in real time.”

I leaned against the door, heart thudding as fear coursed through me. I wanted to curl into a ball and vomit. “M-Myron,” I whispered, “it doesn’t look like the patient wants to be here.” 

“I assure you that he doesn’t,” Myron answered as he soaped up his arms. “Wash up, Aima. This is a wasted opportunity if we don’t act fast,” he explained while snapping on gloves.

The man on the table somehow made his eyes grow even wider as his nostrils flared in panic. Sweat beaded on his pasty white skin as watched Myron lift a scalpel and move toward the table. 

“Myron,” I whispered, “I’ve known you for three years, I know you would never-”

The man strained fruitlessly against his restraints as Myron plunged the scalpel into his abdomen, blood pooling around the cut.

“I can’t do this by myself, Aima. Please. We need his liver.”

I remained speechless as I tried to reconcile what my senses were experiencing with the world I thought I knew. “You’re going to kill him,” I whispered.

Myron looked up at me, haggard. “Yes, Aima. This will kill him.” He sighed. “Just like the bullet that he put into a sixteen-year-old girl named Cora is about to kill her. The fellow on the table used to date Cora’s mother, and she finally got the courage to leave him after his last beating nearly put her into a coma.” He wiped his forehead with his arm. “He promised to hurt Cora if she ever left him, and that promise came true an hour and nineteen minutes ago. Thirteen minutes later, paramedics discovered that his gunshot had destroyed her liver.” He glanced at the well-dressed man in the corner. “We had previously received information that his blood type matched Cora’s, in case the issue ever arose.”

The nausea only compounded itself as I came to understand what was happening.

“We can move freshly donated organs to legitimate providers,” the well-dressed man explained in a soft voice as he stepped into the light. “Unfortunately, those legitimate providers must wait for such donations to present themselves.”

“And they’ve promised Cora’s family that a hepatic donation will arrive within the hour,” Myron added. “Of course, its donor needs to have been freshly living.”

The man on the table groaned in terror. 

“And, due to the nature of our operation, we lack the technology and personnel needed to administer general anesthetic,” the man finished. “Which is most unfortunate for our donors.”

“You don’t need to know everything about medicine to pull this off, Aima,” Myron explained with pleading eyes. “We just need to get this liver out intact.”

The man huffed audibly. 

“Tell me again why you got into medicine,” Myron prodded, his voice soft.

*I closed my eyes and remembered the smell of gasoline and copper. I clutched Mom’s hand as she gasped for air, unable to crawl out from beneath the mangled car door that was pinned against her chest. Her lungs were too compressed to breathe, so she only stared at me, terrified, as her life drained away.* 

*Eight years old is far too young for a child’s world to break.* 

*The drunk driver served twenty months of house arrest and never said he was sorry.* 

I darted to the sink, washed my hands, snapped on some gloves, and grabbed a second scalpel. “Once we sever the hepatic artery and hepatic portal vein, the liver should come out pretty easily.”

Myron grinned. 

“Get ready, boys. This is going to be [messy](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

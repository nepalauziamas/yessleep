On my front lawn is a bed of flowers near the curb. Last week I wanted to teach my five-year-old daughter how to use the hose so she can help with chores around the house, but I knew it'll be hard as she has a habit of not paying attention. I turned on the hose and showed her how it was done with turning the faucet and spraying it. Then I turned the facuet full blast and loads more water shot out and just when I was done saying how to hold it at full blast she started whimpering.

"DAD-DADDY!" she screamed. I turned off the hose and asked what was wrong. "What's is it? Don’t tell me you’re scared of the hose!” "It’s...it's scary! I'm scared!" she cried, tears streaming down her scarlet face. "It's only water you can't drown in it!" But she ran inside and slammed the door as if a tiger was chasing her. I shook my head. Next day I was doing the job again knowing it wasn't worth making her do it and I saw her staring at me through her window and ducked as soon as I turned the water on. I just didn't know what the hell was up with her, I wonder how good of a parent I’ve been these years.

Then my wife called me from her bedroom window. "Hey...you gotta see this I’ve seen something really damn weird I dunno what it is!" I went inside and up to our bedroom and she was looking at our front house security camera on her computer. She showed me the footage of me hosing recorded on many days, including the day where my daughter freaked out. In the video while I was focusing on controlling the hose and facing the flowers my daughter wasn't looking at me or the spraying, but rather the excess water spilling onto the road. I knew her lack of attention paying was going to result from trying this.

But then my eyes travelled away from my daughter as she stood still in the footage, and I looked at what she was looking at instead. In the drain grate where all the water was escaping, I saw something. “I saw it too, in all recordings whenever you watered the flowers!” my wife told me. My wife zoomed in on it, and the quality got grainier but still clear enough to make out something. From between the bars of the grate squeezed out a foot long black rubbery object. It gently swayed from side to side like a snake. It's only notable features was some kind of clear opening at the top. It arched downwards and appeared to slurp all the excess water through this opening. Within we could see small white square shaped objects and a reddish-pink object that looked flat and wide. It was like a mouth full of teeth and a tongue that a human would have! After about five seconds of drinking the water and my daughter panicking, the shape shot down the drain, vanishing as unexpectedly as it arrived.

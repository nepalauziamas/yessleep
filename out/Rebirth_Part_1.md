I couldn't tell any longer what the time was. All I could see was red, or was it green? Maybe it was blue, or orange! No wait, it had to be purple. It definitely had to be purple. But then again, it could be gray. Fuck, I couldn't tell. Not with my eyes in the state that it was. The shear pain of having my eyes gouged out with a fork was unimaginable yet... I was fine? I didn't feel the pain.

I scrambled around on the floor, unable to make out my surroundings. All I remember was my head throbbing in class. It was physics class, I remember. I had to rest my head on my desk during my favorite subject, physics, because it was unbearable. The ringing was so loud and my eyes felt like they were going to pop out of my skull.

Wait... who gouged my eyes out? I was in class, I put my head down, and suddenly I found myself in a quiet place not at my desk with my eye sockets empty, bleeding. A fork... my eyes were gouged out with a fork. I couldn't seem to remember things properly anymore. Everything was so hazy.

I decided to focus instead on trying to find a way out of this place rather than trying to solve a memory puzzle in my head. I crawled around on the floor and felt for things with my hands, patting the ground. Ugh, there was a lot of dust. I hate dust. I patted around a little more until I felt... No this can't be right, it's moving. It's like a liquid but a solid at the same time? I didn't know what it was. It had very little viscosity, much like water yet I could not penetrate the membrane with my hand or fingers. It was like a stress ball but alive. 

I decided to put down the strange object and started patting around again. This time I stumbled across a sharp object. Hmmm, it had to be a knife. Yeah, it was a knife and judging by the size... a kitchen knife! I can use this to defend myself! I gripped the knife tightly and started patting around again, but the wooden floor scraped against the fingers of my hand that held the knife. 

With my left hand, I found a scrap of fabric. It was a shirt! I didn't need that. As I dropped the shirt, I was hit with a wave of pain again, the same headache I had in class. I decided to lay down with my back to the floor so I could rest a little.

I tried blinking but remembered I had no eyes, it was useless yet I still tried to make the movement. All of a sudden, I was hit with this wave of fatigue and exhaustion. No, the ground was wet! Why was the ground wet? My headache was fading away however. I got back to my knees again and remembered the knife in my hand. It was wet too. Strange.

I crawled around a bit more and felt two balls on the floor, they felt squishy. It also felt as though there were cords coming out from one side of each ball... EYEBALLS! THEY COULD BE MY EYEBALLS! I sat on my knees and held the two eyeballs in my hand. Did I really dare to shine them back in my sockets and risk further infection? It's not like I'd see again but it felt so weird having nothing in my sockets. Oh well, it's not like I have much to lose anyway. 

I tested opening one of my eyelids and gently pushing one of the eyeballs in. Still no pain, odd. However, it did fit somehow. I did the same for the other eyeball and again, I was hit with that unbearable headache. I blinked again and to my surprise... I COULD SEE AGAIN! OH GOD I COULD SEE AGAIN! Something wasn't right though. 

I was on the ground on my back again, I never moved from my place. Why was I lying down? I couldn't move my arms or legs. I couldn't move my neck. I was forced to stare at the ceiling. Maybe I was just so exhausted that I couldn't move. I felt an extreme  hunger after all. 

The ceiling was wooden too but I couldn't see any walls. This was probably a massive room. 

Suddenly, I heard creaking from the wood in the ceiling. When the creaking stopped, the two largest wood planks above my my entire body slid open. That's when I saw it. This humanoid black and slimy creature with one white eye and one red eye. It climbed out of the opening in the ceiling and it had the sharpest nails I had ever seen. They dug deep into the wood and the creature had the widest grin with sharp yellow teeth as it stared at me. 

Ah. I had just realized how dark it was in this room. The creature jumped down to my side and crouched above me, its face right above mine. "Well kid, you sure as hell didn't disappoint," it said with the greatest grin. 

I was so confused but it seemed as though the creature knew what I was thinking, leading it to point to the opening in the ceiling from which it emerged from. "Just look there and observe your beauty."

A mirror formed in place of the gap between the wooden planks. 

What. The. Fuck.

I saw my eyes, they were so red that I could no see my pupils. The knife in my hand was stained with blood. The wetness on the floor was blood. Never mind that, my legs... they were gone... halfway through my thighs continued figures that resembled my legs but were black and slimy just like the creature above me. There were bite marks on my forearms as well, all of which were filled in with black and slime. I looked at my groin, it was wet. I had pissed myself but it was drying out. It must have been a while. 

I didn't know what was going on. I could not find it in me to scream or to freak out. Something told me to accept everything as it was. 

"Stand up child. Look around you."

Suddenly, I could move again. Before I got up, I noticed blood around my mouth. I could not taste any blood in my mouth however. I got up and looked around me. What I saw made my stomach howl in pain. I was still in school. Actually, I was in the large abandoned storage shed behind the school. This place would normally be empty but instead there were buts and pieces of flesh and blood everywhere. I found a few fingers, hair, toes, guts, brains, a heart, two livers, and most importantly, one of my legs... half eaten.

The creature stood next to me with its arms folded, just nodding at the sight. I had to ask, "how long has it been since my physics class"

"About 4 days."

"Who did this?" I asked

"Why of course, it was you! Welcome to the gang kiddo! We didn't expect you to eat all of your classmates and even your own legs but we look forward to what you may turn out to be in the future!" It said, and just as it was finishing its sentence, it tapped my forehead gently. That's when it all hit me. I remembered everything.

I wanted to become a demon. I had become a demon. I have yet to become the most powerful demon.

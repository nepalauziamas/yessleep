As a kid, I remember hearing my dad talking about the Isle of Sgail. Once a prison for the wealthy, then a military academy, and then a club for the global elite. While the castle was on an island in Scotland and we were in England, my parents always talked about going there, my dad especially. When he tucked me in, he told me about all the big lavish parties there, how many celebrities frequent there, and how he'll get there one day. I should note that my dad was actually a police superintendent, while my mum was a solicitor, so my dad had no chance of joining, my mum didn't really care near the end, she had a few clients who were members, and she always got the feeling that something dark was going on there.

When I became a teenager, I stopped paying attention to it and decided to focus on university. I wanted to be a chemical engineer and work on an oil rig somewhere, do something decent with my life. Well, It eventually paid off and I finally achieved my dream, got a wife and a son, who's now 5 years old. One morning after my wife took my son to her parents for the day, someone knocked on our door...in 9am in the morning, on a Saturday, on my day off. When I opened it, a gentleman in a 3 piece well fitted navy pinstripe suit, purple shirt, yellow tie, gold tie clip and a white toothy smile straight out of a Colgate advert stood. He introduced himself as Mr Potter, a representative of the Isle of Sgail. I let him in, curious about why he was coming to me, out of all the rich people on this street. He sat down and explained that I've been handpicked by the board of the Isle to become a member. He slid a black and gold box that contained a velvet interior and a handcrafted white opera mask with an invitation to the Halloween festival at the Isle. 

I was hesitant at first, but after thinking for a bit, I accepted. I wanted to see first hand what this place was like, and if there really was something dark going on there. When I arrived at the fancy boat that was taking us there, I was dressed in my best tux and the mask. I was both nervous and excited. When we arrived and entered the doors, it was beautiful! Black and white checked flooring with brown wooden looking walls, big paintings, the lot. I broke away and found a gold door hidden behind the mirror in the bathroom. I managed to get inside without people noticing and ended up at a stone staircase. When I reached the bottom, I found young people in cages, some with eyes missing, just as I was about to scream, I heard someone cough. I turned around and there he was.

Mr potter with a handgun pointed straight at my head.

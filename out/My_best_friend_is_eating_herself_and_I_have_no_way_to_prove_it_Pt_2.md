Goodmorning everyone, first of all, I want to thank you all for the suggestions. Really, thank you for trying. Please stop telling me to leave her alone. Please stop telling me to send this to her; she's smart enough to figure out who 'C' is.

I am at her house right now. Her mom is stuffing me full of chicken noodle soup and wrapping unsolicited blankets around me because she said I look sick, which I do. I haven't slept well since I posted that; I'm always getting woken up by that vague red screen. So I am, quite literally, worried sick.

Anyway, I have to get this out quickly. I can't 'text my mom' forever.

But I wouldn't be posting this if there weren't any updates.

C looked healthy last night and was just as concerned as her mother about my health. I wanted to scream at her and hit her, telling her it's not my health we should all be worried about. I wanted to hug her and beg her to keep herself whole. I want the luxury of just being able to call the police and whisper about it frantically over the dinner table, reveling in such a scandal; I want detachment.

But this is C. My C.

So when her boyfriend came over last night to celebrate C and her weight loss, I watched him like a hawk. Although, of course, my sleep-deprived brain probably twisted every move he made into something much worse. I think the proper word for it is demonization.

God, I'm all over the place. You see this. You know. I'm sorry. God, I have no idea what to do. God, it's funny how little You have to do with this situation.

I remember how her boyfriend, X, looked at her. Not with love, pride, desire, or even just appreciation, contrary to what he came here to do, but he was examining her. Please keep in mind what I said earlier. But I still don't think that that's normal, the way he was scanning her, how his brows were furrowed. When he would wrap his arms around her, padding at her sides and the small of her back, it was as if he was appraising a fruit.

Someone on the last post said he might have been the one who gave her the pouch, which I dismissed-- he is so, so sweet. And charming. But all that warmth he held for her earlier, whatever I'd been seeing, had evaporated. Or maybe he was never warm, and I just never noticed. Maybe it's because I've never seen what lust looks like on someone, and maybe that was lust.

I couldn't sleep last night. All I could hear was the sound of her bedsprings creaking and the heavy fabric of her duvet rustling as she tossed and turned.

She never spoke in her sleep before, but last night she was moaning and grunting. Occasionally, she would whimper and mumble, "I don't have anymore. Please," over and over.

I know now that I'm awake with a good amount of food in my system and a steady head, that I should've woken her up. Any other time she's had a nightmare, I've woken her up and let her talk out her nightmares so we could find out what they were about. But this might've been the only way I could've gotten information from her, spying on the rumblings of her subconscious mind. Here's what I think:

I think the pouch of her fat with that weird sigil is a sacrifice. To who or to what, I have no clue. And I think now that she has her dream body, she both cannot give up her remaining fat nor wants to give up her remaining fat.

I've learned in my health class last year what a very low body fat percentage does to a human body. From what I remember, it makes it hard to walk. I'll have to look it up later.

This hypothesis, or theory, what have you, is only supported by the fact that in one of her "I don't have anymore. Please," cycles, she suddenly burst out, "She has more!" and then stillness. Then a slow creak as she sits up, another as she shifts her weight to the edge of the bed, and the small whines of the floor as she makes her way over to me.

In case you were wondering, yes I use she/her pronouns. Yes, I'm tubby.

I lay frozen by her feet, scarcely daring to breathe. I do not want to be involved in this, I do not want the attention of whatever deity that has her. I want to help her, though. You may think this is stupid, but I lie there, still, waiting for teeth.

All that comes is her soft, incoherent murmuring. Occasionally, I am able to catch a few words:

"I can't ... Not her ... " which was also repeated over and over.

At that moment she had turned into a sort of presence or energy. I don't know the fancy spiritual terms for it. It was like a cloud of heat gathered over me, a predator lying in wait. I felt more than heard her retreat to her bed, then shortly after continued tossing and turning.

Thankfully, she did not go to the bathroom. The entire night, it was just the creaking and rustling, until she grew still and just woke up.

What bothers me the most is that she acted completely normal. She's glowing as if she slept restfully, and fretting over me as if I am the one who's... doing whatever she's doing.

I don't know what to do anymore. How can she, this girl who flushes whenever she lies, act so normal after an 8-hour-long nightmare like that? Is she even aware of it? Is she possessed at night, and all of it is a demonic sort of sleepwalking? Am I completely insane?

I think I should burn the pouch. But I've watched enough horror movies and seen enough posts from 'witches' saying that there is a proper way to dispose of spiritually loaded things. I'm afraid that if I do just burn it, it'll simply reappear and target me next.

Is there anyone out there who is a witch, or knows someone who is a witch? How would I get rid of something like this?

Also, someone on my last post asked me what the sigil looked like, and it was just 2 circles inside each other (one obviously smaller), with a bunch of spokes running through it. The spokes had lines crossing them and had tails facing outward (of the circle) with tails that look like the greek symbol psi. That's as much as I can remember, though. I haven't seen it for like a week.

If you know of anyone who can perform an exorcism, preferably one that's more in depth than the Christian ones they do in movies, or any way I could dispose of the pouch without endangering her, please let me know. Preferably I would like to carefully disentangle C from whatever entity she's dealing with without getting myself personally involved.

Thank you all for the help. I want this to end as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I'll finish this bowl of soup and actually text my mom.

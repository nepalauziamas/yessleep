I’m real, aren’t I?

This town that’s been my home for almost three years—it’s real.

This house.

Real.

This copy of my body.  

Tell me it’s real.

Tell me I’m not a static shadow which should have bled into nothing a long time ago.

Tell me I’m not going to lose myself like them.

…
…
…

This will be in 2 parts. 

Again, for my sanity.

Exactly four days, six hours and twenty seven seconds ago—I was the last human in Bolivia House. 

After dying over 30 times and being copied, rendered and blended with reality, my body a feast for my housemates--

I was still a living, breathing human being.  

… 

“Still no sign of Sam?” It was hard to keep my voice from cracking, but I managed it. I was thankful the library was mostly empty. 

It was my solace pre-pandemic when I was driving myself crazy over finals, or I just wanted to get through a book without getting distracted. Located on the top floor of our main building, it’s the cosiest room I’ve ever had the pleasure to be inside. 

Marlow State library is split into two; the study section, with rows of desks and shelves filled with every book imaginable, rustic walls and old fashioned paintings making up the aesthetic, as well as the relaxation corner made up of bean bags surrounding a roaring fireplace, and fancy threaded couches in patterns resembling something out of the Harry Potter movies. “No.” Poppy’s voice was barely a croak. I could tell she had been up all night waiting.

Waiting for Sam to come home.

Sam, who I was 75% sure, had been murdered by my housemates. And I was in a fuck-load of denial.

It had been three days of complete darkness, with the sun no longer rising, or at least being blocked out, and I was surprised students were bothering to go to class. They were mostly townies, some of which who believed the lie about the darkness being a product of ash from a volcano. I still wasn’t sure what it was myself, but it sure as hell didn’t have a logical explanation. Still though, people came in and out of the library, acting like everything was normal.

 I respected that.

“Nin.” Poppy said again through a sob. “He’s not back yet,” she exhaled out a breath. “Where is he?”

“He’s fine.” I lied. “Poppy, he probably went to visit his parents.”

“No, I called them!” Her yell sent a shiver down my spine. “Is he dead, Nin? Is that why he’s not back?”

I paused, my fingers curling around my phone.

I had been asking myself that question since the night of Sam’s disappearance.

Even when I knew the answer.

Despite the library being mostly deserted, I suddenly felt like every eye was on me.

It was my first time stepping out of the house since regaining my memories of the night my housemates were murdered and turned into something not quite human, and I’d spent the majority of my time avoiding them like the plague. It’s not like I was still scared of them. I didn’t have that luxury. 

I just didn’t know how to talk. 

That should be a specific ‘quirk’ each Bolivia House resident harbours. 

None of us know how to communicate—especially about things which need to be talked about. 

Kaz has no problem lecturing me about washing up or ranting about video games, but when it comes to talking about what happened the night neither of them remember, the night they were mercilessly tortured and killed over and over again, ending in them giving into moonlight and ripping half of the town council apart under her spell—yeah. 

They don’t want to talk about that. 

I think it was their way of convincing themselves they were still human, still clinging on to the parts of themselves which weren’t flooded with her light. Not talking can be good, of course. It can ease tension so things that need to be said can be avoided. But avoiding it for long periods of time, which they were clearly trying to master, wasn’t healthy.

I guess you could say it was living in a house full of bratty teenagers and I was the parent. Rowan was ignoring the world while translating the message clawed into his ceiling, and Imogen seemed more interested in the latest Netflix show (failing to realise we are living a fucking Netflix show). 

Neither of them wanted to talk about the psychotic cult who had done this to them in the first place. 

I wanted to ask Kaz how he was so close to Sam. I knew the two of them had a history, but what kind of relationship did they have? I still remembered the way Sam had looked at my housemate. 

Not hate or resentment. Something else. 

And that something had motivated his cruelty, forcing him to mutilate Kaz until he was screaming into his gag. 

I wanted to admit my friend’s involvement in their kidnapping, but every time I tried to talk about anything related to that night, they shut me out. 

So, yeah. Denial. 

Kaz wanted to play video games and smoke weed, and it seemed like a mutual agreement between them that they were going to intentionally ignore my attempts at a Bolivia House intervention. I made myself scarce and ended up conducting my own investigation. After requesting every book the library had on lunar cycles, as well as human behaviour, and several articles on The Transylvania Effect,  I set up my laptop where I usually studied. I’d spent the whole night prior downloading a program which was supposed to live-track the moon’s cycle. In the back of my head I was telling myself it was all over overkill—that there was no way we could beat the moon herself—especially when she had already taken the first steps in taking over our town.

It was the night of totality, a harvest moon to be exact, which marks fall being upon us, and I was expecting something bad to happen after several precious days of normality. Neither of us had died and I was getting far too comfy in my 29th body.

Thankfully, my housemates weren’t acting any weirder than they usually were. Unless you count Rowan’s hyperactive state during the hours leading up to totality, and Imogen’s sour mood. When I’d left them several hours earlier, they were doing their usual protection ritual, taping up all the doors and windows and hiding everything reflective to avoid light. I wanted to help in any way I could. In a way, I guess you could say I was distracting my own thoughts. I didn’t want to think about certain things. Like the bodies six feet under in our yard, and the curl of dread in my gut every time I thought about Sam.

I had been expecting a call from Poppy, but she barely spoke at all, leaving me to drown in long pauses, while flashes of the that night replayed in my head. I knew I’d seen Sam make it out. I saw him run out of the door while I was left to be pray for the others.

So, where was he? Why wasn’t he back yet?

Poppy didn’t say anything after that, only promising me to text her if I had news. She ended the call, and I swallowed all the emotion building up inside me threatening to burst. I had to stay focused. In front of me was the moon’s current position in the sky, each movement being live tracked underneath. According to the program, totality was estimated at around 7:23PM.

Lifting my head, I glimpsed out of the library windows.

Clear skies.

Fuck.

Not good. If there was anything more annoying than the moon herself, it was the lack of cloud in the sky.

Glancing down at my phone, I took note of the time. 

Day and night no longer existed, while the line between reality and something entirely else was thinning, blurring into nothing. 

Like my static hands after being copied.

 I was still trying to wrap my head around a single town drowning in the dark while the rest of the world were completely oblivious to something completely horrifying, if not extraordinary. 

Still though, I had to keep a clear head. It was almost 5:30. That left me around two hours to get as much research done as possible before heading home to prepare for the night ahead. I sunk into my research, flipping through books of all varieties; ancient ones battered with broken spines and pages falling apart, as well as brand new editions with glossy covers.

 It’s not like any of them helped. 

I was just reading the same thing repeatedly with nothing suggesting the idea of mind control or the ability to create monsters. Some articles were helpful, though. According to them, the moon has always been suspected of affecting human emotion when it’s at its brightest, and went on to explain The Transylvania Effect, which was the theory that the moon has influenced people to kill. Some books told me woman were more likely to be affected during their menstrual cycle, as well as also being blamed in influencing antisocial behaviour in teenagers and young people. 

The local books were where things started to get a little more interesting. Ones which had been published in the town. After half an hour of nothing, my patience starting to thin, I pried open a bound leather book which looked like it had been published in the dark ages, only to get whiplash from the first few sentences. Devil’s. I only had to read the word to remember Sam’s gang who kidnapped my housemates. 

They called them devil’s. Inhuman. The book was almost a word-for-word explanation of the town’s history—exactly what the cult woman had told us. Except, while she had found pleasure in telling of those 100 days and 100 nights of the dark, the book called it Armageddon and Hell, speaking of a force which took over town’s people, filling them with a desire to consume human flesh.

What I was reading only raised more questions, and I found myself in a frenzy, my head spinning, thoughts whirling, as I flipped through the book. I had just started to skim through a chapter titled, “Devil’s: How to spot them” when someone tapped me on the shoulder. The copious amounts of coffee I’d downed crept back up my throat in a sour bile when I twisted around, only to be face to face with a stranger. 

The man was several years older than me, late twenties or early thirties. A professor, judging from his suit, and the pile of books pressed to his chest. He looked friendly enough, peering at my laptop.

“Is that Japanese?” He was referring to the program. I downloaded the English version, though some parts were lost in translation.

“Chinese.” I said. “I think.”

He hummed, peering closer. I resisted the urge to shut my laptop. “What exactly are you doing? Some kind of project?”

I nodded, resting my elbow over the page I’d been reading. “The moon fascinates me.”

He arched a brow, squinting at a blurry live image of the sky in different parts of the world. “It fascinates you enough to download a program and track its progress?” He said. “Not to mention all this research. It seems more like an obsession.”

His expression was trying to pick me apart to appease his curiosity. Luckily, I wasn’t that stupid.

“It’s pretty to look at.”

“Indeed.” He nodded, a patronising smile curving on his lips. “But you’re not studying it like a passion project or a hobby. I don’t see one speck of excitement or exhilaration in your eyes and expression.” The man frowned, “Sorry, I didn’t get your name. I learn so many and forget them too. Only students which interest me get the pleasure of me remembering them.”

“Nin.”

“Nin.” The professor continued. “Like I said, it appears you don’t just like the moon and it’s cycles. I would believe it was simply fascination if you weren’t up to your eyes in research and empty coffee cups. You want to piece together everything about her. Every reading, every movement and tracking which appears.” He nodded at the screen. “You’re waiting for it.”

I caught his smile dampen slightly. “Now the question is, what exactly are you waiting for?”

Struggling to keep a neutral expression, I cleared my throat and slammed the laptop shut. “Like I said. It’s pretty to look at.”

He paused, and within that moment of silence I thought I was going to be sick.

His eyes were studying me, ripping me apart and delving inside every crevice of me, searching for something. After a moment, his smile returned. “If you say so.” He said, leaning back with a chuckle. “Also, I’d check the time difference on the software itself if you want to get an accurate reading.” He poked the screen, before heading over to a table and sitting down, getting out his laptop, and a pile of paperwork— smiling at me pensively over his mug of coffee. Like he knew something I didn’t.

After a while, the professor’s attention went to his paperwork, but I couldn’t bring myself to continue skimming the book I’d been reading. Instead, I focused on the program, scribbling the readings in my notebook for later reference. 

More students flooded in when I was deep in concentration mode. I recognised their voices from class. Abigail Matheson and Maya Harlot, along with some younger students slumping down in the beanbags near the fireplace. “Is he still not answering?” Abigail made herself comfortable. “These disappearances are freaking me out. First, a guy from our class, and now Noah and Allie?”

Something cold slipped down my spine.

Noah and Allie. I knew both of them. I didn’t realise they too had gone missing.

“It’s definitely because of you-know-what.” Maya said, stretching out on a beanbag. “I bet there’s going to be a curfew. First the sky goes dark, and then students start disappearing? Tell me that’s not a coincidence. I bet it’s ritualistic sacrifice again.”

“What?” Abigail laughed. “Bullshit!”

“It’s a real thing,” Maya insisted. “They called it Bloodletting.” Her words drew my attention to her automatically, my gut twisting into knots. The books had spoken of bloodletting, as well as the cult woman herself. Bolivia House was supposed to be their place of sacrifice. Maya must have been a townie, I thought. Which meant she knew all about the moon’s influence.

“Hey, Nin.”

I lifted my head, trying to smile. Her eyes were on me.

“You know Sam Fuller.”

I swallowed. “What about him?”

“Didn’t you hear? Sam’s one of the missing.” Maya mocked a sympathetic pout. It didn’t suit a twenty three year old student to wear the expression of a little kid, but the girl pulled it off. I thought back to something I’d read about the idea that the moon turned grown adults childlike to stop them suspecting her controlling them. 

The book wasn’t a legit source, but I couldn’t help wonder if that is exactly what was happening with my classmates. “You didn’t happen to see him the other night, did you?” Her eyes narrowed. “Actually, now that I think about it, didn’t he write an article trashing your housemates?”

“I haven’t seen Sam.” I lied. “Not in a while, anyway. We don’t talk anymore.”

“Speak of the devil’s,” she said with a smile. 

“Look who’s just walked in!”

Twisting around in my chair, I followed her line of sight. And I wasn’t the only one. 

As if everyone in my vicinity had been listening to Maya's words, every eye found the automatic doors when they slid open and two figures emerged.

I'd forgotten my housemates had fed several hours earlier. After feeding, especially on the night of a full moon, they gave off an aura, almost a glow, which was... hypnotising. That's all I can say to describe it. I'd seen them in two state's: starving, and fully fed. When they were starving, they resembled a faded photograph, deteriorating until flesh turned to static. It showed in their face, in splintering skin leaking moonlight, gaunt cheeks and haunted eyes while she punished them. When they were fed, however, it was a different story. 

The complete opposite. Instead of fading, they became too bright, almost overexposed. Like they were bleeding into reality, and then whatever was beyond. All at once, my thoughts were empty and there she was again, when I found I couldn't blink, my body paralysed. She was faint, but very much there, murmuring into my foggy mind.

Imogen called it her mirror self, the only time she looked decent to look at, her flaws disappearing for one glorious moment while her face morphed into something inhumanely beautiful. Which explained why she spent hours in the bathroom staring at herself hours before totality hit us. She told me it was the only thing she could accept—the only positive to being what she was. I didn't really understand Immie’s words until I was seeing this phenomenon in action. This time hitting the boy’s.

I’ve known Rowan and Kaz almost two years and I never found either of them attractive. They were conventionally, though I’ve always seen them as my older brothers. At that moment, though, past feelings went out of the window, and I was forced to look at them whether I liked it or not, my gaze drawn to every part of them. Lips. Nose. Eyes. Every freckle on Kaz’s cheeks, Rowan’s angular jaw. It’s not like they would draw that kind of attention at any other time, but under the looming full moon, they were beacons. 

She was making damn sure of that—showing them off. I don’t know what it was, the raybans hiding moonlit eyes, or the aura around them magnifying what they were wearing; simple jeans and sweatshirts, Rowan sporting a beanie, while Kaz hid under his hood-- I couldn’t look away. I couldn't move. Couldn't think. They were like Siren's, drawing breath from my lungs. 

Though they didn’t capture attention for long. 

After half a second, I was released from whatever held me in a choke hold, and I could breathe again. I blinked myself out of my trance, resisting the urge to jump up and drag them out of there. Both of them were oblivious to their audience, the two talking in murmurs, heads pressed together in deep conversation. I didn’t realise I was still staring at them until Rowan was standing in front of me, waving his hands in my face.

“Yo.” My housemate clicked his fingers impatiently when I failed to respond. “Hey. Dude, are you having a stroke?”

Kaz chuckled next to him, slipping off his raybans and placing them on his head.  “You’re catching flies, Nin.”

I blinked again, my gaze flashing to the windows, that familiar feeling of panic creeping its way up my spine and twisting in my stomach. The exposed windows. Catching movement at the corner of my eye, I watched the professor from earlier stand up, heading over to the window before shutting the blinds. When the librarian cleared her throat in questioning, he sent her a smile. “I apologise.” He said, sitting back at his table. “I can’t concentrate with the blinds open. I hope you don’t mind?”

She ignored him.

When I found my voice, I turned back to the boy’s who had taken seats opposite me. They didn’t seem moon drunk, at least not yet. Kaz automatically leaned over to peer at my laptop curiously, while Rowan turned my scrapped notes into paper airplanes, his fingers moving in frenzied movements. “What are you doing here?” I lowered my voice. “It’s a full moon. Aren’t you supposed to be hiding at home?” I nodded pointedly at the windows. ”Those blinds aren’t going to protect you guys.”

“Please. We’re practically experts on this shit by now.” Rowan said, “We’re handling it.”

Another question hit me. “Where’s Imogen?”

“Relax, she’s at home making last minute preparations.” Kaz shrugged. “I’m heading to the town meeting, and Rowan was bored translating, so followed me.” He prodded my laptop screen. “Isn’t this Chinese software? What are you working on?”

“It’s tracking the moon,” I said impatiently, “Which happens to be rising in under an hour, and both of you are exposed.”

“We’re fine.” Rowan rolled his eyes, “Besides, we have to keep up appearances. We can’t just hide, or people will get suspicious.”

They were already suspicious. Risking a glance at Maya across the room, I swallowed frustration building in my throat.

“You two are either moon drunk or stupid.” I stabbed the screen. “The moon could rise at any moment. Do you remember the last time it did?” I caught my housemate’s eyes when he slipped off his raybans, an ethereal light glittering around his iris. “Cafe de Nin?” I emphasized on my name, and Rowan laughed. Loudly. The librarian shot him a dirty look to his delight.

“Aww, she thinks some foreign program can help us.” He  reached across the table and ruffled my hair. “Adorable. It’s almost like she feels guilty for leaving us to die.” When Kaz elbowed him, hard, he cleared his throat. “In all seriousness, we’re fine. We’ve mapped it out a hundred times before, and we can block her out. It’s easy. We just tape up every window like usual and hide in our rooms all night. The only reason why she got us last time was because this genius decided to open the door.”

So, they were moon-drunk. I recognised that dopy look in the boy’s eyes.

 “I was trying to get away from you guys after finding you eating my mutilated corpse.”

“You still exposed us, Nin.”

Ignoring his smirk, I sat back. “It was pitch black at lunchtime today.” I said. “We’re not exactly in normal times right now, which means status quo doesn’t apply.” I gestured to the program. “The moon can rise and fall whenever she wants to.”

Kaz lifted a brow, already playing with the program. “So, why are you tracking her?”

“I’m getting an estimate.” I said, changing the subject back to the state of them.

“Do either of you even realise you’re giving off a Siren effect right now?”

“Siren effect?” Kaz frowned. “Elaborate.”

“I mean you’re both lit up like the Eiffel Tower and looking at you is hurting my brain.”

I gestured to the raybans perched on Kaz’s head. “Shouldn’t you be wearing those?”

My housemate wrinkled his nose. “We look like a knock off Paramore. Also, nobody wears raybans unironically.”

"Did you not notice people staring when you walked in?” I shoved him. “You really care about your appearance right now?”

“So, what you’re saying is we look good?” Rowan paused in murdering my notes, sending me a pensive look.

“Good? Yes.” I watched him take out his flask, wincing at whatever was sloshing at the bottom. “Human? Debatable.”

Rowan noticed my glance, tightening his fingers around the flask. “Thirsty?” He flashed me a grin. I could glimpse the shadow of the moon’s light slowly blooming behind his eyes. “It’s amazing what you can do when you blend up the human intestine.”

I could feel myself retracting back in my chair, my toes curling, vomit searing my throat.

My housemates must have seen my expression, the two of them sharing a look. The kind of look your little brother’s have when they’ve just put a whoopie cushion under your seat.  “I'm kidding. It's coffee." He downed half of the flask. “I’m offended that you think I’d actually bring parts of you to school. I can’t even imagine what would happen if this spilled over.”

“Behave.” Kaz shot him warning eyes, before jumping up. “Are you almost done here, Nin? I’m gonna head to the town meeting before the moon rises. I’ll pick up some takeout pizza on the way home, and we can have our usual Monopoly night.”


“I’m almost done.” I said to Kaz’s question. “But you don’t eat human food. Unless you blend it with pieces of me.”

“You still do.” Kaz shrugged. “Also, if anyone have their eyes on us, we’re a totally normal household, who eat pizza, and play video games— and definitely do not engage in causal cannibalism.” He nodded to me. As usual, Kaz was taking up the role of leader. He was natural at ordering us around.  “Ring me if there are any problems, okay? Rowan, stop being a dick. You’ve got translations to do. If we can figure out what’s clawed into your ceiling, we’ll have a better idea what we’re dealing with.”

"But being a dick is my specialty. What else have I got, huh? Rowan lowered his voice, resting his head in his arms. "The moon has me by the balls, and I eat my housemate to survive.”

Kaz grinned. "The moon has me by the balls and I eat my housemate to survive. Sounds like a shitty light novel title."

"You're a shitty light novel title."

"Exactly my point." Kaz was backing away, shouldering his backpack. “I’ll see you guys later, alright? I gotta scope out this town meeting.” He kept his voice low, almost a breathy murmur. “If there’s any talk about those dead guys, I’ll let you know.”

When Kaz was gone, Rowan ticked all the boxes in pissing me off. He spent twenty minutes tapping beats on the table, and when he was warned by the librarian, he grabbed one of my books and flipped through it, his knee bouncing against mine.

The guy couldn't sit still. "Aren't you supposed to be translating that message?" I finally said, looking up from a book.

He scoffed, chewing on a pen. "I figured out what it said a while ago. I'm having trouble registering it."

"And what does it say?"

My housemate seemed to have sobered up. "We can leave that till tonight. I'm mid existential crisis right now."

His expression told me to leave it, so I did. Instead, I picked up his flask, taking an experimental sip. 

De-caff.

 "How can you drink this?” I asked curiously. “Aren't you half moon-zombie?”

To my surprise, Rowan laughed. I liked that laugh. It was genuine—reminding me of who he had been before the night he was brutally murdered. "Thanks." He said. "Moon zombie has a ring to it.  And yeah. It dulls the cravings. Kaz sometimes mixes it with…” Rowan trailed off, his gaze going to the table. “Actually, you probably don’t want to know what he puts in it. Let’s just call it a secret recipe. We blend coffee, ice cream, and a certain special ingredient, and bam! Actual mouthgasm.”

My stomach turned at his words, but I was  getting used to it. Instead of replying, I went back to skim-reading.

When my housemate went quiet, I figured something was on his mind. He hadn’t annoyed me for over five minutes, and that was a record. I took his brooding attitude as an opportunity. "Rowan, do you remember what  happened that night?"

"More or less." He muttered, glaring at the grains in the table. "You abandoned us, and I got a knife through my head--"

"No, before that." I said quickly, cutting him off.  

"Nah. I suppressed all that bullshit.” His voice cracked, and I knew he was lying. “That cult bitch was a fucking maniac.”

Rowan had a habit of denying things which were clearly obvious. He was also remarkably stubborn.

Of course he remembered pieces of that night-- he'd starved for days, and she in turn had punished him.

When I went back to reading, he pulled his knees to his chest in the first vulnerable position I’d seen him in. He sighed, leaning his head on his arms.  "What I do know, is whatever they did to us-- what she did to us--  I'm sure we’re… wrong.”

"What?"

He didn’t lift his head. "Whatever they tried to turn us into. I don't think we're supposed to have... you know, free thought.”

"Or she's playing with you." I said, "She's waiting for you to let your guard down."

"Exactly." He mumbled. “What if one of us doesn’t come back next time?”

I couldn’t resist a small smile. “You should have established by now that we can’t die. She’s constantly making copies.”

"No, I mean... consciously.” His eyes darkened. “What if she takes that last piece of us away? Permanently?”

His voice was breaking slightly, that facade he'd built around himself crumbling.

"Rowan."

“Hmm?"

I finally asked the question which had been driving me crazy. “Where are your original bodies?"

“Never mind that.” He was reading though a local book I’d discarded. Rowan picked it up, showing me the page.

“A human sacrifice must be offered,” He said, as I followed where he was reading, “To complete the ceremony. It also has to be completed when the fall equinox begins.” Rowan screwed up his face. “I’m pretty sure we died halfway through June.”

I frowned. “Weren’t you the human sacrifices?”

“I thought that too. So, that’s why she hasn’t fully taken us.” He whispered, “There’s two fucking rituals.”

Something warm crept up my throat. “But the fall equinox isn’t for weeks, right?”

Opening his mouth to reply, my housemate stopped when something dripped down his  temple. I caught it before him, my body jolting in horror. 

Because I’d seen this before. It took me a moment to realise, my heart jumping into my throat when I remembered the gilded knife slicing through his skull, deep, dark red rivulets pooling in rivers down his face inside Bolivia House’s basement.

I remembered him silently pleading with me to help him, his lips opening and closing, trying to form words when the woman twisted the knife penetrating him. But it wasn’t blood.

Blinking rapidly, I struggled to make sense of what was happening in front of me. Maya Dolores standing behind my housemate, holding a plastic bottle of water and pouring it over his head. Rowan was soaking, his hair plastered to his head, but he wasn’t giving a visible reaction. Maya’s dark eyes found mine. “Did you know that the human body is 60% water? The moon affects the tides, so it has an effect on water too. I’ve always been told that water is a sure way to reveal devil’s hiding in plain sight.”

I don’t know what she was expecting—the water to trigger him to turn? That didn’t happen, thankfully.

Though I can’t say I wasn’t waiting for it, paralysed to my chair.

When I couldn’t speak, Rowan turned to the girl. He didn’t look pissed. If anything, he was amused.

"Devil's?" Spitting out water, my housemate wiped his face with the sleeves of his sweatshirt. “Enlighten me on your clear psychotic break, Maya.”

He started to take off his glasses, and I kicked him under the table.

Maya dropped the bottle. “You don’t sound like you’re up to date with the lore, Beck.” She said. “Devil’s. People without shadows.”

I caught his fingernails digging into the desk, something inhuman flickering in his expression he was trying to keep neutral.

“Uh-huh.” Rowan nodded along, “How old are you again? Twenty three, and you still believe in fairytales?”

The girl shrugged, looking him up and down, her lips curling with disgust.  “What if I’m looking at one?”

Rowan’s lip curved into a smirk. “Are you hitting on me, Maya?”

She was dragged away after that. According to her friends, she’d had too much to drink.

Handing my housemate my jacket for him to dry himself on, I eyed the puddle of water he was sitting in. “Are you okay?”

Rowan shrugged, dragging a hand through damp curls. "Not really. Townies are talking about Devil’s. Which means the town, or at least some of them, are dumb enough to believe whoever came after us. If people start talking, we’ll be suspects.”

"The town council.” I said. “Who are also six feet under in our yard."

"Precisely." He pulled out his phone, and I started to pack up, dumping my laptop and books in my backpack.

"We should probably go.” Rowan’s gaze flashed to the blinds. “She’ll be making her move soon.”

His phone vibrated. "It's Immie." He murmured, frowning at the screen.

 “She’s not using emoji's, so she's either pissed, or the moon got her."

Rowan was frowning at his phone for way longer than necessary, and it reminded me of that look-- the certain dazed look he got under the full moon's influence when his gaze caught something reflective. I opened my mouth to speak, to snap him out of it, before he lifted his head, his brown eyes wide and frenzied. His hair was still damp, strands glued to his forehead. "Apparently, they're rounding up freshmen, as well as anyone from out of town." He said, his eyes growing progressively darker as he jumped to his feet. Rowan had a strange grace, despite clearly panicking. He tucked the chair under the table, before power-walking to the exit, nodding a silent goodbye to the librarian.

I followed, my heart diving into my throat. We were out of the door in a single breath, with Rowan taking two steps at a time down the stairway, keeping his head down. "We're fucked." He said, "It's the Salem witch trials all over again, except yes, we are definitely guilty for, you know..."

"That doesn't matter." I managed to get out, tripping over myself to keep up with his stride.

Rowan let out a spluttered laugh, yanking open a door leading us into the empty college reception. "I'm guessing Maya Delores wasn't talking bullshit after all." He scoffed, turning around, shooting me an annoyed look. “Which reminds me! I get a dirty look for laughing, and she can dump water all over me and it’s apparently fine? Now, that’s favouritism.”

I wanted to believe that. But I’d also caught the librarian sneaking glances at Rowan during our classmate’s speech.

“We’re going back to the house.” Rowan panted. “Kaz isn’t answering his texts, and Immie’s phone’s switched off.”

The town were already hunting them. With the disappearances, as well as permanent night taking over what was supposed to be day, it made sense people were scared. But something was wrong. It felt... planned. Sensing his desperation to keep the others safe, I revelled in it. Metamorphosis had definitely changed him. "So, there is no town meeting?" I forced my legs to work. "Which means Kaz just walked into a trap." I swallowed a scream. "They're hunting down people without shadows."

"Yep." He said. "They're smart. I'll give them that. They've been trying to lure us there since the announcement.”

"They know about you?"

"Somehow. I'm guessing this isn't the first time our cult friends have used out of towner's as sacrificial lambs. The town are following a protocol already set in place for this kind of shit. Which means they know about the moon and her influence, as well as the casual cannibalism. You said those people called us Devil's. Which means it's only a matter of time before—"

I didn’t notice his phone slip from his grasp, shattering on the ground.

He was a klutz, after all.

When he stopped abruptly, though, as well as his words bleeding into nothing, I caught up with him. The automatic door was open, leading out of the college's reception, but my housemate stood on the threshold, perfectly still, paralysed to the spot. At first, I thought we had been cornered, with townies figuring out where we were. But Rowan didn't look scared or threatened. Instead, his head was tipped back, half lidded eyes gracing the harvest moon which, of course, had risen earlier than I thought, taking over the sky, bathing everything below, including my housemate's face, in milky white light.

I thought back to what the professor said, about time zones, mentally kicking myself when I realised the program was running on Chinese time. It was either that, or the moon herself had decided to make an appearance an hour early. For a moment, I was transfixed by my housemate. A devil in plain sight. 

Just like Maya had said. 

The moon loomed over us, casting her glow on my housemate, revealing his lack of shadow, and filling his eyes with that light I was all too familiar with by now. Unlike last time, it was fast. No longer slow, bleeding into him--- it drowned him, giving him no time to breathe, to fight her breaking into his mind. Before I could hesitate, I grabbed him, pulling him out of the allure, and he stumbled in my arms, light as a feather. Fuck, I thought. “Rowan.” I said, trying to swallow my panic. The possibility of him lunging at me and ripping out my throat haunted the back of my mind, but I stood my ground despite every instinct inside me telling me to get the fuck away.

When he started forwards, I grabbed his sleeve. His eyes found nothing, oblivion, except the illuminated sky above us.

“Snap out of it.” I said shakily. “Remember what you were saying earlier?” I shook him again, “About her taking everything? If you don’t push her out, that’s what’s going to happen.” He ignored me, taking a step forwards, like the moon herself was leading him away. Pulling my jacket out of my bag, I handed it to him. “Use this as a blindfold. You need to get out moonlight.”

"Are you still looking for Sam?" His voice was strangely melodic, immediately taking me off guard.

“What?”

"Sam." He said again, his lips curving. Under the moon's influence, his smile was cruel-- and I could believe the cult woman's words. That he was her soldier, a monster of her making, every piece of him shattering and coming apart, and entwining to become everything she wanted. "Your friend who tortured us the other night. The friend you’re still yet to tell us about.”

“That…” I fought for my own words. I took a step back, and then another, adrenaline kicking my body into overdrive. “That’s different.”

“It’s really not.” I was all too aware of his arm whipping out, his hand wrapping around my neck, claw-like fingernails piercing my flesh. But I couldn’t move. Something in his eyes was new; that ethereal light I was used to spreading and filling his pupils. His skin was splintering again, moonlight leaking out—but not because he was starving. She was doing to this to him, breaking him apart right in front of me, tearing into flesh until bright red pooled, mixing with startling allure. “You were hiding him.”

Black spots speckled my vision as I fought for precious breath.

Rowan’s lips broke out into a wide smile. “You were hiding him from us weren’t you?”

I couldn’t answer.

“Come to think of it, I do know where Sam is. Do you want to see him?” He was waiting for my answer, squeezing tighter, and I was losing consciousness fast. 

I couldn’t reply, choking on my own sobs. I don’t remember him snapping my neck, but I do remember waking up, curled into a ball, the curve of his sneaker slamming into my head. The amount of times I died is still foggy because I have no memories of those copies of myself. The copies ripped apart. 

This time there are no gaps in my brain, no shadows in my memories. I remember still being half static when he dragged me into the dark. Under the full moon, I lay on my back while my housemate tore into me slowly, so he knew I’d feel everything. Every pinch of his teeth piercing my flesh, his fingers snapping my bones. Once. Twice. Three times. I had only ever had nightmares of feeling it.  I’ve never felt the sensation before— of being eaten alive. 

The parts of me which needed to stay to keep me conscious weren’t touched, while everything else was cleanly ripped open, glistening in front of me. There was so much red, and it was mine, pooling from me. It almost felt like I was having an out of body experience. Tugging. I felt his teeth ragging at my guts, pulling them out of me, emptying me out. Hollowing me out until my brain gave up, and I found peaceful, blanketed shadow. Darkness, which felt so good, so comforting and empty, I didn’t want to bleed back to reality. Until it choked me back out.

I came back in flashes of consciousness, my newest copy hauled over Rowan’s shoulder.

His shoes pounded on concrete, and I stared down at the road, squeezing my eyes shut against her dizzying light.

Partially static, I was thankful for no feeling yet. I wanted to stay like that. I didn’t want my flesh to grow back.

I wondered where he was taking me.

I got my answer when we arrived back at the house, and Rowan dragged down to the basement. I only managed to glimpse my best friend tied down to a sacrificial table under the skylight. His body looked… wrong. Like it had two layers. One light, and one dark. The dark part of him, bleeding black, was pinned to the table. Rowan’s fingers tangled in my ponytail, shoving me to my knees.

Joining him were Kaz, and Imogen, completely taken over, their eyes on the moon. Rowan's shaky voice from earlier dawned in my mind. "Is she going to take that last part of us away? Permanently?" 

You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.

That was my final thought, before the cult woman’s stiletto heel sent me spiralling.

Not dead, not knocked out.

Spiralling.

I’d like to tell you the second time I ended up in Bolivia House’s basement, I got away again.

But then I’d be lying.


I’ll post more in a few days.

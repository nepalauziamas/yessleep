**Audio Diary Entry 1.1 (Present) - TRANSMISSION STARTED.................**

My name is Dave Kuwosaki, just your average 17 year old teen in his last high school years and im one of those who talks to myself often. Born into a poor family my entire life has been a rollercoaster of problems and struggles. My mother (Elena) works two full time jobs, both day and night shifts and I barely get to see her throughout the week. 

Then there's my asshole of a father (Gavin), who never bothered to get a job and is always demanding payment from my mom which pisses me off because he does nothing to contribute towards our current financial situation and is always drinking his expensive boozes. He always gets mad and abusive over the smallest things. 

My little sister ( Hailey 3 years old ) had been my own responsibility ever since her birth. Both my parents are incapable of taking care of her so I had to do it myself to watch her, and protect her. 

As you may imagine, our lives as the Kuwosaki family is such a failure. There's no recovering from it. The money was not the problem, i could not care less if we were poor. 

The problem was my father. He used to be so kind and sweet and worked so hard for the family as a tradesman in construction. But 2 years ago that changed. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

One day my father came home drunk and all of a sudden in a fit of rage he had physically abused my defenceless mother. I had no idea what was going on so I tried to stop him from hurting mother any longer. 

My father pushed me away and screamed "I fucking hate this family!!, Elena you damned whore of a wife! That baby is not mine! and My son a fucken murderer!!! Why did you kill your sister?!?!". I was shocked at a time and I couldn't believe it. His accusations were far stretched with my mother cheating on him and me a murderer? It made no sense, none of that were true whatsoever.

My mother tried to explain that his accusations were false but my father could not believe it and continued to beat my mother almost to the death. I tried to stop him but he elbowed me hard on my chest. Fortunately, a friend from the neighbourhood heard our cries and called 911. 

Police had arrived to the scene and cuffed my father away to be detained for a while for abuse. The whole question in my mind was... "Why?". My father who was once a kind yet happy man turned into something so vicious who was lost in rage. Even my mother who had a lot of bruises on her face and body even questioned the sudden change. 

The whole town (Luna Valley) heard the story of Gavin Kuwosaki suddenly abusing his wife infront of 2 children. Everyone knew my father as a kind person who takes care of others and his family was his pride. When everyone heard of my father's accusations, they all find it hard to believe but it seems they were the reason behind my father's rage. 

The investigators came to us to ask for questions in regards of my father's alleged accusations of my mother cheating on him and me Dave Kuwosaki being a murderer of my sister. The questioning went nowhere because of two facts alone. My sister is 100% related to my father and mother and she is alive and well. 

Days after the incident, the town of Luna Valley believed that my father simply went crazy in the head but his rage seemed genuine and still insisted that his accusations are true. Even after showing my little sister to my father, he still claims that its a clone or a look alike to cover it up.

The judge court of justice decided that my father will be placed to a mental hospital until he is "right" in the head. Although he had only been there for 6 days and is now considered "normal" through many therapy checks but his entire personality changed and the love that he once gave us, was gone like it never existed. 

The whole ordeal did not make any sense, why did my father make accusations that are completely false? That day when he returned home drunk before brutally abusing my mother, i also noticed something different about him, it is my father but just different... 

Ever since that day he has simply been an asshole to the entire family, guilt tripping my mother for cheating and me for killing my own sister and replacing her with a replica. Because of my father's reputation of abuse, hardly any company took him in for work and since then he has stopped working which had put our family into a financial crisis. So my mother decided to take on 2 full time jobs and had entrusted me to take care of my 1 year old little sister.

Many days i tried to convince my mother to divorce my father and take me and my sister in full custody as I believed she has every advantage to do so. But my mother still loves the bastard and believes that one day, he will change. I find that hard to believe and had a back to back argument with her which led to nowhere changing her mind. 

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Back to the present, and its been 2 years since the incident that completely changed our lives. My father still holds a grudge that shouldn't even exist and my mother works hard everyday in hopes to change him but nothing seems to work. 

One night I dream of a dark figure in a forest chasing me yet trying to hurt me and ripping off my face as if it wants to steal my face and wear it. Weirdly enough, the next morning there was a sign of bruises on my face. But i did not think much of it and though I must have hurt myself in my sleep.

I decided to find a job for myself to support the family but with the responsibility of taking care of my sister it will remain difficult. 

I tried to seek for help in hopes of hiring a nanny for my little sister, I had other commitments and realistically im no expert in baby sitting. After days of seeking for help ,a close friend (Cassey) of mine from school who was willing to do so for free which did me a big favour, I promised her that I would return the favor one day and I 100% trust her since i knew her since middle school. 

It did not take long to find a job, online i saw an advertisement for a tree cutting company and scheduled for training. Apparently the meet up place is in the middle of the woods which was kind of shady but I vetted the company and they were pretty legit: Registration, Date of creation, certificates, pictures of the team and what they do. Also the pay of $40 per hour is good for a student like me.

The instructions and directions of the meeting place was kinda simple...which read:  
**" Arrive to 112 \[redacted\] Drive at 4pm, from there enter into a walkway in the forest and keep walking straight until you see a large abundant tree and turn east from there. Keep going then until you see a man named Adam in black uniform"**

I went to the area via Bus and found the green gate walkway but something seemed off about the place. My gut tells me to not go in there but I was desperate for a job so I had no choice. I followed the instructions and kept walking straight hoping to see the designated tree. 

More than an hour has passed and I still see no tree ahead and its getting dark.. I though I had missed the tree and I should return but I overthink to myself that maybe the company was testing my mettle and determination so I kept going. The whole thing didn't feel right, the advertisement, the location, and the instructions. yet.. still no large abundant tree ahead. My gut however, still screams for me to just walk away from all this but I already came this far to even give up.

It's 7pm and its completely dark, I only had my phone flashlight on as I kept walking for miles ahead, yet still no large abundant tree. All of a sudden, i saw a dark figure on the left side of where I am standing. It simply stared at me. Being creeped out, i paid it no attention and decided to keep walking. As I moved, the figure is moving to the opposite direction of where I am heading. When i stopped moving, it also stops which is weird as if its trying to mimic my movement. 

I did not want to investigate simply because I do not want to deal with a potential crack head or some weird person in the forest so I simply just kept moving forward.

30 mins later had passed and I decided to give up since its not worth the trouble, so i tried to turn on google maps to see where I am but I have no reception to access it. But as I flashed my phone's light ahead I saw the end of the walkway which has the green gate. As i reached the end I see the sign "112 \[redacted\] Drive" on the same street. 

I realised that i went back to where I started and I was shocked in confusion knowing that I simply walked straight or maybe the darkness had me subconsciously turning around. I also questioned myself of the dark figure in the forest and though that may had been Adam who I was supposed to meet with, but creepily enough Adam did not saying to me when we encountered but simply copied my movements instead?

I tried not to think about it so I simply try to go home by taking the bus again. When I aboard the bus, the driver looked at me in fear and told me to step out or he will call the cops. I was confused as to why he is doing this as I tried to explain myself that I did nothing wrong. The bus driver called me a pathological liar and a killer. I told him that my father was just crazy and his accusations are false.

"How dare you lie to my face like that, even after what you did!" The bus driver exclaimed. 

He then called 911 and told the cops that I am here. I was speechless and don't know what to say since anything I say that are facts seems to not register to the mans head. So I told him that I will stay and explain to the cops since the cops knew my situation beforehand. 

The cops arrived and pulled their guns towards me.

"Dave Kuwosaki, you are under arrest!" Cop #1 said. 

I was in a state of confusion as to why they are doing this so i tried to explain myself. 

"You have the right to remain silent!" Cop #2 said. 

"You are under arrest for the murder of \[redacted\] Kuwosaki & Gavin Kuwosaki!" Cop #1 said. 

"No Way..." I said. 

"I did not kill them I swear! My sister is alive with my appointed baby sitter Cassey!" I said. 

They seem to ignore what I just said and looked at me with cold eyes as if it was really true. i was taken to the police vehicle and drove me to the police station to be interrogated. 

In the interrogation room, an investigator stepped into the room and asked him what was going on. 

"We have finally found you all these years and It seems you have forgotten... what you did." He said

I told him that earlier I was accused of killing my own sister and father by the bus driver, which did not made sense because I had an alibi and I had no reason to. I can provide proof by calling my close friend Cassey who was literally taking care of my little sister.

"This claim sounds amusing, why are you trying to hard to defend yourself? After what you have done 2 years ago" He said.

I honestly though this was a huge misunderstanding and tried to clear it up by calling Cassey. However, the number did not exist. I told myself in the head what's going on. Its all so weird and somehow escalated to these outright alleged claims. 

"If you really have forgotten, let me refresh your memory" He said. 

The investigator pulled out a recording disc and placed it on the TV monitor system. The disc really dates back to 2 years ago. But what I saw in the recording was heart breaking and terrifying...

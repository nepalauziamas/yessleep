I needed a place to share this, so I chose here. I don't have any family left to rant to, so the next best option is Reddit. 

I'll start my saying my name is Matt (M 32) and I have a daughter named Maddison/Maddie (F 7). My wife is missing, we've been searching for two years but she's ended up as one of those ignored missing person's cases. 

She disappeared while I was on a business trip in California. My wife was staying home with my daughter (who was five at the time) in South Carolina. 

Apparently, there was screaming coming from my home. High pitched, terrified, screaming. Though after a bit it became more muffled before it stopped completely. My neighbor Danny (M 28) who heard the screaming came over to check. My daughter opened the door and said nothing was wrong. 

When I returned home, my wife was nowhere to be found. I nor Danny said anything to the cops about the screaming, as we were afraid we'd be subject to a murder trial. 

Fast forward to now, Maddie is a little unsettled by her mother's disappearance. She often talks about her and how much she misses her. Though sometimes she says odd things like, "I know where mummy is!" I laugh it off as nothing, but it unsettles me a bit. 

Yesterday my daughter showed me something horrifying. I came back from work and Maddie stood at the door like a dog waiting for me. Her eyes lit up seeing me come in as she began happily shouting, "Daddy! You won't believe what I did today!" 
"Well what'd you do, honey?"
"One moment, I need to make sure it's perfect!" 
She skipped back to her room and slipped in so I couldn't see inside. 

I had hired a nanny to keep her company for the while between school and when I came home from work. She was still in her room, but I shouted, "Maddie, where's Alexandria? I don't see her!"
"I'm not sure," she said whilst giggling a bit. 

She slipped back out of her room and grabbed my arm to guide me back to it. I was intrigued to see what she had been so proud of. She opened the door and I had forgotten how to breathe for a second. 

There was our nanny Alexandria, sitting on her knees with her hands tied behind her back. There was duct tape across her mouth and she was sobbing. Her forehead had been subject to many cuts and scars. Some of her fingers had been cut off and laid on the floor while her hand gushed blood. 

Maddie looked at me and whispered, "Are you proud of me daddy?"
I didn't reply. 

"Wait! One last thing!" I watched her walk to her closet and stand in front of the door. 
"Today is you and mummy's 5th anniversary!" 
It was. I forgot about it. For the past two years I couldn't bear the thought of her. 

Maddie opened her closet and my wife's decaying body dropped onto the ground. 

"Happy anniversary, daddy!"

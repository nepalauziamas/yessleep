So… I met my girlfriend, let’s call her K, about two years ago. She’s currently pregnant with our first child and we were happy. We were finally having the little family both of us had always dreamt of. But let me back up.

Shortly after I met her we were talking about our biggest fears. Me, I’m afraid of heights. Hers? Wendigo. Skinwalkers. She’s always been wildly superstitious about them, no speaking their name or whistling at night, sprinkling salt, burning sage, etc. As ridiculous as I truly thought this was I put up with it. We all have our silly superstitions. I crush up egg shells to keep the witches away myself because that’s what my mother always taught me.

 I remember one night when, shortly after finishing up a co-op game we were playing together on the Xbox, I went to grab another beer and whistled the theme song to that game as I opened it, and I returned to our bedroom to see her bawling on the bed. I truly didn’t do this intentionally and did my best to comfort her as I was met by her yelling at me and shoving me away. So we just went to bed and I decided to take it a little more seriously from then on out. 

We went on and never mentioned that situation again, but on my 23rd birthday we went out to a steakhouse to have dinner. When we arrived home around 10 o’clock or so I could have sworn I saw a tall, pale white figure dash into the woods behind our house, our dog, Odin, a stout black pit bull, growling and standing at attention looking in it’s direction. I mentioned it to her as she didn’t see it, and all the color drained from her face and begged me to just get in the house. So we go inside, let the dog in, and she was upset for the rest of the night. I was sure it was just a trick of the brain, I was tired, I work 12 hour shifts, I knew I was just seeing things as I frequent horror channels on YouTube in my spare time.

We never encountered anything like that again but K just kind of… seemed distant. She never was the same from that night on, being short in conversation, staring off into space, getting angry about tiny things. Last night I woke up to what sounded like scratches on the window. Again, figured it was just a trick of the brain, I got up to use the bathroom and grab a cup of water. The cup of water flew from my hand as I heard a blood curdling scream from outside coming from the woods. It was her voice. Screaming my name, screaming for me to come help her. I ran to the bedroom and K was right there. Sitting straight up in the bed, staring at me with a soulless expression. Not fear. Not sadness. Completely blank. Then she made eye contact with me, and made the same whistle I made that night despite never being able to whistle before, smiled at me, and said “don’t go out there. Stay here with me. Protect me.” In almost a mocking tone, that sick smile not faltering. I laid in bed horrified, didn’t sleep at all. 

I don’t know what to do. They got her. I know they did. That isn’t K anymore. But it wants me to play along or they’ll come for me too. I don’t know what to do.

3/9/22

People streamed from their seats, rushing to the doors as the demon stepped through the portal. Karabasan snapped his fingers, and the doors shut tight, locking them in. The audience banged on at the exits, shrieking.

The scuffle on the stage had stilled, Jacob and Jeremy both staring openmouthed at the demon. I stood numbly before it, the microphone now useless at my side.

**“My, what a ruckus they make,”** Karabasan said. He no longer wore his human form but was back as a humanoid mass of shadows and darkness, with spindly, too long limbs that ended in thin, sharp claws. A pulse of power went out from him, and everyone slumped, falling to the ground. On the stage, Jeremy had fallen as well, leaving only me and Jacob standing.

“What did you do to them?” I asked, my throat dry from terror. 

Karabasan shrugged indifferently. **“They’re just sleeping. I wouldn’t worry about them; I need them. But you two, on the other hand…”** A dark hand raised towards us, and I felt my body gripped by a crushing force. Me and Jacob were lifted into the air by the demon, struggling vainly at our binding.

**“You two have been nothing but a pain, an itch I couldn’t scratch. Those MAOIs were clever, I admit. Infuriating, but clever.”** The grin disappeared. **“As much as I enjoyed our nightly chats, Thomas, your usefulness has ended.”** The constriction around us grew tighter. I felt myself being uncomfortably contorted, air being forced from my lungs as an invisible force pressed in. 

Stars danced in my vision, my head swam from pain and lack of air. 

A beam of purple energy hit Karabasan squarely in his head, knocking him off his feet. The bonds holding me and Jacob disappeared, and we fell to the stage, gasping for air, our whole body tingling with pain.

**“Who DARES?”** Karabasan roared, staggering to his feet, head swiveling, searching for the one who shot him. Another bolt of energy came from the back of the auditorium, striking the demon in the head again.

“Run,” I whispered to Jacob. We both scrambled out the stage’s back exit, listening to the demon’s fury. 

Wayne stood in the back, looking a bit worse for wear, but alive and well. “I wasn’t sure if you two were still alive,” He said wearily. “So. Karabasan’s broken through, then?”

“Unfortunately, yes,” I replied. “Something seems to be fighting him, though. I didn’t get a good look at who, I just ran.”

“Good,” Wayne said. “You did what you could. Pity it didn’t work. It seems my… friend has arrived.” He hesitated, as if not sure if he could call them that. “A guy I used to work with. One of the best hunters of the supernatural I’ve ever seen. We’re not exactly on speaking terms anymore, but he knows better than to ignore a threat like this. We’ll take care of the demon, don’t worry.” He unstrapped his lightning gun and handed me something, a familiar leather book. “You two are to make for the saferoom in the catacombs. I don’t want any arguing—” He held up his hand to cut us off. “You’re not ready to fight a being from the Immaterial Plane who’s crossed over. None of us are, really. This thing’s nigh omnipotent. So, that being said, you’re to get to the saferoom and hide there. Hopefully that’ll allow you to escape detection. I’ll come get you when it’s over.”

I begrudgingly took Mr. Richardson’s journal. “Fine.”

Wayne slapped me on the shoulder. “Wonderful. Stay safe, you two.” Then he pushed past us and vanished into the fray of the auditorium.

“Come on,” Jacob said. “Let’s get out of here while we still can.”

“Hang on.” I felt something tugging me back towards the door that led to the stage. I turned towards it. The aperture showed us a vision of destruction, a monstrous shadowy demon assaulted by twin bolts of purple and blue. Power thrummed from the portal. I could feel it beating against me. “Do you feel that?” 

“Feel what?” Jacob came and stood beside me, facing the tear in reality.

“There’s something… emanating… from the portal…” I took a tentative step towards the door. It seemed to call to me.

“Whoa, there,” Jacob grabbed my shoulder and pulled me back. “What are you doing? We have to leave, not head back towards the fight with an omnipotent demon.”

I jerked back to reality. I could still feel the tug of the power, but it no longer clouded my mind. “Right. Sorry,” I shook my head, the mental fog dissipating. “You’re right. Let’s get out of here.” We ran through the backstage area and out into the deserted school hall lined with lockers, only to stop short.

“Nooo,” Jacob groaned. “Not him again!”

Standing at the end of the hall, blocking the only way forward, was Gadson. He had changed. Gone was his monstrous hound-like form, in its place was a more humanoid guise. His skin was ash grey, pale enough to see black veins under it. He had both arms again, and they both still ended in spindly claws, but the strange spikes bristling across his body were gone, save for the top of his head, where they erupted from his skull like spiky hair. His eyes were malevolent slits of darkness, his mouth twisted in a jagged toothed smile. He wore a blood red robe with black highlights that came down to the floor.

“Hello, boys,” He snarled. “Running away from the master, are we?”

Jacob adopted a fighting stance, unsheathing his sword. “You stay away from us,” He called. “We’ve fought you off before, we’ll do it again.”

I glanced around for anything to use as a weapon, but there was none within reach. I had left Wayne’s other lightning gun down by the HVAC unit. I figured the best option was to stall for time and hopefully catch him off guard. “Why are you still here? Didn’t Wayne finish you off or something downstairs?”

“That simpleton could never kill me,” Gadson sneered. “I am the avatar of Karabasan. I am power itself.” He blurred, suddenly right in front of us, hand clasped over top of Jacob’s head. **“Sleep,”** He commanded, and Jacob dropped to the floor, sword clattering from his hand.

I sprang at the sword, diving for the floor, but Gadson blurred again, his fist catching me in my stomach and smacking me back into the lockers. Stars exploded in my head, and I slumped to the floor, coughing, trying to breathe. A hand grabbed me roughly and lifted me up. Gadson’s twisted visage swam before me. He smirked. “Let’s not get any foolish ideas now.”

“What do you want with me?” I snarled, squirming in his grasp.

“It’s not me who wants to see you,” Gadson dragged me backstage, my hurt arm crawling with pain. Despite my struggling, I couldn’t break his iron grip. Jacob lay unconscious on the floor, his sword on the ground beside him, no hope of rescue from him. “The master does. He wants to personally kill you. He’ll deal with you presently.”

We emerged onto the stage, the black-purple tear in reality still throbbing with outpouring power. It buffeted against me like a strong wind. The auditorium itself was chaos. Wayne and his friend darted in the midst of rows of chairs, occasionally firing bursts of energy at a nebulous black cloud hovering near the ceiling. 

**“You fools think you can stop me?”** Karabasan thundered from above. Four long dark spikes skewered the ground, stabbing at the duo, who rolled and dodged to avoid the blows. **“Your weapons are useless. Bow before me, and your deaths will be painless.”**

“We bow to no one,” Wayne shot back, lightning arcing from his gun to Karabasan. It seemed to have no effect. “Least of all a wannabe god.”

“You don’t know what you’re playing at here,” Someone else shouted. I assumed it was Wayne’s friend, but I couldn’t get a good look at him. He was crouched behind some chairs. “Even if you kill us, the full might of the Psi Force will descend on this town. You cannot possibly hope to resist them.”

Karabasan laughed, and a wave of energy exploded out from him. My eyes watered from the force of it even though most was somehow deflected around Gadson and I. The rest of the auditorium, however, did not fare as well. Boards splintered on the stage, buckling inwards. Entire rows of chairs were ripped from the floor and thrown through the walls. The sleeping bodies of the audience were scattered to the far corners of the room. Impossibly, no one woke. I assumed Karabasan was still holding them in his power. Wayne and his friend were thrown to the back of the room, bouncing off the far wall with a painful sounding thud. They fell to their knees.

Karabasan fell like a torrent of water, shadows billowing and flowing as he coalesced into his usual demonic form in the center of the room. I couldn’t see his face, but I assumed he was smiling his deranged grin. I could hear it in his voice.

**“You poor, deluded men,”** He took a step forward, his claws lengthening, gleaming in the dull light. Wayne staggered to his feet, leveling his gun. A jagged bold of brilliant blue lightning arced to Karabasan, crackling and spitting sparks. The bolt was absorbed into him with ease. The demon kept walking. Wayne grimaced, the gun whining, shaking in his hands. **“You could never fight back in any way that matters. I am a being of the Immaterial Plane. The Physical World is but a playground to entities such as me.”** He casually batted Wayne to the side, sending him spinning across the room to collide hard with a wall. He groaned and did not rise. Rage rose up in me, the power of the portal stoking it further.

The other man had regained his senses now, stirring. Karabasan loomed over him, spindly arms clasped behind his back. **“And you… you** ***did*** **have something interesting with you. A Subterran gun, I believe?”** 

Wayne’s friend suddenly moved, bringing the gun up and firing directly at Karabasan’s face. The demon, however, was ready for this. His arm blurred, and he blocked the purple energy with a clawed hand. The force of the beam pushed him back a little, but he held firm.

**“If you really wanted to stand a chance, you should have brought something from Necromium,”** Karabasan hissed. “**But you’ll pay for your oversight with your life.”** Faster than my eye could follow, his other arm speared the man through the heart. He gasped in pain, the purple beam cutting off abruptly, gun falling from his hand. 

“No!” I screamed. I felt a surge of power, and suddenly I’m holding Jacob’s sword. I swing it up, slicing through Gadson’s robed arm and sprint towards the backstage exit. Gadson howls in pain. I can feel Karabasan’s focus shift to me, him whirling to face the stage. My knees buckle as the emanations from the tear in reality slam into me. The air shimmers blue and I feel like I’m being dropped, spinning, down a long shaft. My vision goes black and suddenly I slam onto cold tiles, coughing, my arm throbbing. I raise myself from the floor, my hand still clutching Jacob’s sword, and realize I’m outside of the principal’s office. My mind flashes to the Underrunes that kept the central room safe in the catacombs. They line the office, too. I don’t have time to worry about how I managed to grab Jacob’s sword or make it across the school in seconds. I need safety.

I staggered to my feet and opened the door, lurching into the office. Someone shrieks in alarm. I snap to attention, raising the sword, before realizing it’s just Mrs. Hill huddled in a corner of her office. I breathe a sigh of relief and close the door behind me. Terrified, confused mortals I could deal with. A superpowered avatar of an invading demon I could not. “Oh, hello,” I said, slumping into one of the chairs by the wall, breathing out deeply. I felt a sudden exhaustion fall over me.

“What… what’s happening?” The principal asked me in a shaky voice. 

“What I tried to warn you about,” I sighed. “The supernatural evil working here has spilled over into the Physical World.”

“No…” Mrs. Hill whispered, trying to maintain her neat little worldview, the same one I’d had shattered over the past two weeks. “No, no…”

“Don’t you see?” I stood and jabbed the sword point first behind the loose baseboard I’d seen on my last visit here and pried it back, the wood splintering. Glowing purple glyphs shone on the walls beneath. “Even your office is marked by the otherworldly. These runes are the only reason you haven’t been affected the demon.”

“The-- the demon?” Mrs. Hill asked.

“Karabasan. A dream demon who’s been invading the mind of every single person who steps into this building. Every single one, except you.” I pointed to the runes. “These were put in place by your predecessor, who died fighting this demon.” I decided to neglect to mention that he’d been the one to summon it in the first place. “They keep you safe. The others have to either resort to a more scientific approach or simply accept the nightly torture.”

Hill’s face paled. “You mean—”

I nodded grimly. “Every single soul that has entered this building has fallen prey to Karabasan.”

Her hand rose to cover her mouth. “No! No, it can’t be true—”

“Face it,” I said, “You made a mistake. So have I. In a way, this is all my fault. But now’s not the time to dwell on our mistakes, because we have work to do.” I held out my hand to woman. “You in?”

Her eyes flicked to my hand and then met mine, her gaze turning steely. She grasped my hand and pulled herself to her feet. “Right. So what do we do?” 

I propped the sword against the wall and pulled Mr. Richardson’s journal from my pocket. “This is the old principal’s journal, chronicling his fight against the demon. I figure our best bet is to use something from this to fight back. He has notes on how to use runes. I think there might be something useful in that.” 

“Where did you find this?” Mrs. Hill asked me.

“Catacombs beneath the school,” I grunted, scanning the pages.

The door to the office burst open, and in staggered Northrup. I gasped. “Northrup! What? How?”

Northrup slammed the door shut behind, panting. “It’s right behind me, you idiots! Get ready!” A shrieking came from halls outside, the sound of howling winds and fury. 

**“Where did you go**?” I heard Karabasan growl. **“I know you’re here somewhere.”** The window to the office darkened as a pulsing mass of shadows moved through the hall.

I grabbed my sword. “Step back,” I told Northrup, and miraculously, he actually listened. I moved to the window, peering through.

“Here we are,” I called to the darkness.

“Are you insane?!” Northrup hissed, half whispering. “That thing will kill us all!”

I smiled darkly. “Not yet. It can’t get in here.”

In the hall, two blazing eyes opened in the cloud of darkness, which shifted and solidified into a humanoid form. **“Ah. Thomas. My old friend. I should’ve known you’d be here.”**

“Karabasan,” I responded. “Hello again.”

**“I must say, you impressed me,”** Karabasan grinned. **“Escaping Gadson is not an easy feat, especially now that I have made him my avatar.”** 

“Yeah, well, we all have our secrets,” I shrugged, trying to act casual. I had no clue how I actually managed to escape. “How’s world domination going?”

**“Splendidly, thank you for asking. Anyways, I do have a rather full schedule today. I’m supposed to take over the continent by nightfall tonight.”**

“All well and good,” I said nonchalantly. “Except that we’re going to stop you.”

**“That’s cute,”** The demon said. **“You think you have a chance against me? I’ll crush you where you stand, you insolent fool.”** He exploded outward in a rippling mass of darkness, battering against the walls and the door of the office. I stood on the other side of the window, watching as the demon wrought his fury against our fortification. There was a roar from the demon, and he drew back, glowing eyes narrowed. Tiles, lockers, and pipes were ripped from the building, floating in the air, slowly turning. It reminded me of the poltergeist. With a blur of movement they shot towards the wall, but stopped millimeters from impacting. Karabasan’s eyes narrowed further; I sensed his exertion. Finally he released his control of the projectiles, and they fell to the floor. 

**“Fine,”** He snarled. **“So you’re safe in your little office. We’ll see what good that does you. Live out the rest of your miserable lives huddling in your sanctuary, then.”** With that, the collection of object he had hurled at us were flung at the door again, not to break it down, but rather block all exit. **“Have fun rotting away! I’m going to conquer your precious town.”** 

His presence retreated. Northrup and Hill breathed a collective sigh of relief. I turned, smiling broadly. “I think that went rather well, all things considered.”

“Are you insane?” Northrup repeated. “That—that *thing*, whatever it is, just told us it’s going to conquer the world. It referred to you as an *old friend!”* He drew himself up to his full height, which was, admittedly, a good bit taller than me. “Did you work with it? Did you bring it here?”

I laughed. “If I brought Karabasan into this world, do you think I’d be hiding in this office with you? Don’t be ridiculous. Of course I didn’t. But now that it is here, we need to come up with a plan to stop it.”

“In case you didn’t notice, Karabasan blocked our exit,” Mrs. Hill pointed to the pile of various lockers and piles barricading the door.

“Well,” I said, “Not really.” I opened the door; it swung inwards. “Seems like our local tyrannical demon doesn’t know which way inside doors swing. All we have to do is a bit of manual labor and then we’ll be out of here.”

“To do what, exactly?” Northrup snapped. “In case you didn’t realize, that is an extremely powerful entity out there. He has other creatures roaming the halls! I saw them on my run over! How do you think we can fight that thing?”

“I’ve done it before,” I maintained.

“Unsuccessfully,” Northrup snorted, returning to his usual abrasive self. “I’m actually surprised to see you here. I’d have figured you’d be one of the first to die, you’re that incompetent.” 

“Surprisingly, you’re almost right for once,” I responded, trying not to let my irritation show. “I almost *did* die, in fact, but I managed to escape Gadson and make it here, so clearly I’m not the totally incompetent.” Even if I didn’t quite understand what happened, it still counted, right?

“Boys, don’t fight,” Hill commanded. “Now is not the time or the place. I understand you two don’t see eye to eye on things, but right now we are facing a threat beyond our comprehension. Let bygones be bygones, got it?”

“Fine,” I muttered. 

Northrup only snorted in disdain. “So what *is* the plan, solider boy?” 

I ignored the jab. “There’s a portal in the auditorium where the demon came through. An incursion, it’s called. From what I understand, the demon is sustained by the energy flowing through. If we can fix the tear in reality, we can banish the demon. I think.” I returned to Richardson’s journal, flipping through the pages.

“And how, exactly, are we going to close a literal tear in reality?” Northrup asked.

I grinned, finally finding the page I was looking for, and turned to face them. It read ‘sealing runes’ across the top. “With this.”

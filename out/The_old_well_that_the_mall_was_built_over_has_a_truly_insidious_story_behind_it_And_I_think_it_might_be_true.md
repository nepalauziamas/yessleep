I haven’t talked about this since it happened, back in 2017. I was never one to believe in scary stories, and I’ve tried to forget it even happened to me. But the legend of the Well Dweller is real, and I’m writing this to make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.

As closing time inched closer, I started packing away yogurt toppings. It seemed like the yogurt shop at the mall’s food court was losing its charm, because I could count the customers I had today on one hand. 

Suddenly, a hand reached out and grabbed the wall connected to the Cajun Grill right next door. Dan’s familiar face appeared as he threw a cleaning rag over his shoulder. “Hey Mals, want to ditch security and hang out by the fountain with us tonight? I heard an old lady came by today with a whole roll of silver dollars, score!” 

I guess that beat walking home alone. “Sure,” I replied, forcing a smile. As the mall music stopped and the lights flickered on, a signal to all mall-goers that it was time to head home, the soft buzzing of the fluorescent lights echoed as everyone hopped over the counter of their respective food court shops. 

I followed the gang to the fountain, a center piece at the mall, and sat down on the ledge. Everyone was chatting and searching for coins at the bottom of the mall fountain. The smell of chlorine started to make me nauseous. “I should’ve just gone home,” I thought.

As I sat there in my stupid Yogurt World uniform, I remembered I had fished my headphone through my sleeve so I could listen to music during an extra boring shift. I hit “Play” on my phone and cupped my hand to my ear. As “Good Looking” by Suki Waterhouse started playing, the world stopped. I was able to breathe again. 

“Whatcha listening to?” I heard. Startled, I looked over to see Maya, the girl who works across from me at The Coffee Bean. “Oh… uh, Suki Waterhouse” I managed to sputter out. She laughed lightly. It almost sounded like she was singing. Maya held her palm up, showing me the coins she scored from the fountain. 

A few pennies, a silver dollar, and some weird old misshapen coin with foreign letters on it. Puzzled, I pointed at it. “What is that thing?” Maya smiled as a few drops of water fell from her red hair. She picked it up and inspected it intently. “Hmm, I think it’s an ancient relic that the old Well Dweller used to latch onto her victims.” She winked and handed it to me. I took it and held it gingerly between two fingers. 

I must have made a face as she threw her head back and chuckled. “I’m kidding, it’s around Halloween time, you don’t like scary stories?” I don’t, but I half smiled anyway. “Sure I do,” I replied. 

I knew the stories about the Well Dweller, how the Trenton Mall was built over an old well. They placed the fountain over it as a tribute to its memory, and legend has it that the Well Dweller chooses a vulnerable victim to disguise itself and latch onto. 

It withers away your sanity by making you see things that aren’t there, and once you become weak, it can take over your body. Kind of like a possession, I guess. Only this thing makes you watch as it attacks victims using your own body, your own face. It’s what keeps you at bay as it uses you to do what it wants.

The only way to know it’s really the Well Dweller is to watch for wet footsteps, and dripping water. But, Maya was obviously wet from digging for coins, and it’s just a stupid story that kids use to scare their friends during sleepovers. Right?

Suddenly, the coin in between my fingers burned red hot. I dropped it and heard it drop into the fountain, and as the coin burned even hotter, the water near it began to boil. With wide eyes, I looked up at Maya. She smiled, but then something changed. 

Her eyes seemed to flash a green glimmer, and her teeth grew in all directions, like thorns on a vine. My mouth gaped in horror, but no scream came out. I was frozen in place, looking into the eyes of something that was no longer human. It grabbed the back of my neck and dunked my head into the fountain. As I struggled and screamed, I wondered why none of the people by the fountain were trying to help me. 

I saw the coin in the water, burning red. A whisper from underwater spoke to me in another language I didn’t recognize. *ego sum tu* it whispered. As the air in my lungs dissipated and floated to the surface, I closed my eyes and accepted my fate. When I opened them again, Maya was staring at me blankly as we sat by the fountain. “Are you okay?” She asked. 

Hyperventilating, I touched my neck, my face, and backed away from Maya, trembling from the thought of almost losing my life at the hands of whatever that was. But then I realized… I wasn’t even wet. Did I just imagine that whole thing? 

I felt different, but *good*. So good in fact, that I could run a marathon, clear out a whole buffet of food, and still have energy left to work a whole shift at Yogurt World. That’s when I started to hear the whispers. They weren’t coming from anywhere in the mall, but from inside my head. I couldn’t quite make out the words, it was quiet enough that it was just out of reach. 

I looked at Maya and smiled. Something had changed inside me, but maybe it wasn’t a bad thing. I had newfound confidence, something I’ve never had before. 

I wish I had known in that moment that the Well Dweller got me.

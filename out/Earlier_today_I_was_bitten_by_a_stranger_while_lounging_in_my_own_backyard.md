I was in my backyard when the man came stumbling through bushes, bleeding from his mouth, and muttering about something – a man or men who had done something terrible to him and his family. Naturally, I rushed over to him, setting my drink down—I'd been drinking some lemonade and listening to a podcast all morning. At first, he didn't seem to see me; he just kept mumbling and walking, his arms across his chest and his eyes turned skyward, as if looking for something there. There was so much blood, I didn’t necessarily want to touch him, but I figured I’d better get him to settle down; so I lightly placed my hand on his his shoulder and guided him toward the chair I’d been sitting in.  

He followed, barely cognizant of my presence, muttering incoherently all the while. I had to practically force him to sit down, and when he did, he put his hands on his face and began crying; and I swear it looked like he was crying blood; it just gushed out of him as he wept. It was then that I noticed the paleness of his skin, both in relation to his clothing—a plain, silken robe, which I for some reason didn’t find weird at the time—and some simple leather boots, obviously handmade. 

He was as pallid as a corpse, and the blood streaking down his skin look eerily lustrous, as if filled with tiny little specks of light. Unsure of what to do about the blood, or how to possibly console him, I got out my phone to call the police – but his hand shot out and gripped my wrist before I could dial. With blood trailing from between his lips, and eyes like black diamonds, he said, “No. Don’t bring them here. No matter what, they can’t know that I’m here.”  

There was pain in his eyes, a deep, unrelatable pain; but in that moment, seized by his surprisingly strong grip, I felt panic and fear - not compassion or sympathy. This stranger had emerged onto my backyard, leaking a strangely bright blood, and was preventing me from calling the police. The circumstances weren’t exactly pleasant; the firmness of his grip and the intensity of his gaze didn’t exactly engender a spirit of trustworthiness. But I refrained from calling the police, as he had wished – not that I had a choice, really.  

Slowly, he withdrew his hand and brought it to his lap, leaving the other partly over his mouth, somewhat staunching the ceaseless surge of blood. Sitting down opposite him, I asked, nervously, what had happened. He turned his face to the sky again, and his eyes—uncannily dark—glistened in the sunlight, taking the star’s brilliance full on. I hadn’t been able to look in the general direction of the sun all morning, it was so bright. And yet this strange man was able to comfortably stare right at it.  As if beholding it for the first time and drinking in its rays with his eyes. 

He waited a moment, as if to choose the words or order the events properly in his head, and then spoke:  

“One of us, an innocent at heart, uncovered certain knowledge about our kind – a piece of what had, for many years, been well-kept lore. Upon learning this forsaken arcana, he decided to embark on a journey, of sorts. He ventured beyond our territory—something expressly forbidden, mind you—and entered yours. He brought one of you back – a woman – and... did as the old, terrible lore instructed. He *feasted* on her, and, as foretold, became as she was. Not completely – but enough. Enough to know what it is like to be human. He was instilled with a human's vigor and vitality. Endowed with your might." 

Somehow, I hadn’t noticed before, but upon hearing that final part, the word “human”, I finally took full stock of the man’s bizarre appearance. My mind finally allowed me to behold the totality of his physical weirdness. The seams, cracks, and carefully—*but not completely*—hidden lines in his skin: spaces between pieces; outlines of holes and indentations in the flesh. The paleness of the skin I’d noticed before, but the porcelain smoothness of it had eluded me. I saw the syrupy viscosity of the omitted blood; almost aglow in the light, and redder than anything I'd ever seen. There was an air and aspect of artificiality about his appearance, about his very being. Only his clothing seemed natural in any significant regard; the threads plainly handwoven and sewn, rather than having been stitched together by some machine.  

Now thoroughly, almost paralyzingly unsettled by this facsimile of a man, I asked what his morbid tale had to do with his presence in my backyard, and the blood that was still leaking from his mouth. He turned to me, eyes burning blackly in the sunlight, and said: 

“The people of our home were appalled, of course. We’d avoided contact with your kind for years, since our Makers left us to our own devices and lives. We hadn't trespassed once in all that time, you see? So, knowing that his actions would bring the wrath of Men upon us, we sought to unmake him ourselves, and leave the pieces for he authorities of your people to find – in a preemptive effort toward peace and reconciliation. But what we hadn’t expected, what we had forgotten about that accursed lore, was that the flesh gave him...power, strength beyond ours. Terrible, monstrous strength. He went through us like –well, like dolls. Smashing, destroying, unmaking. There was nothing we could do. I would’ve stayed, would’ve died with the rest of them. But a thought came to me, a means to put an end to this maddened cannibal and preserve what dignity I could of my people's remains.”  

He stopped, his voice catching in the hollowness of his fleshless throat. Beneath us, the blood pooled like slime upon the patio; never seeping into the concrete, but remaining on the surface. Terrified, but still wanting, *almost needing* to know more, I asked him to continue.  

Looking me in the eyes, with a pain deeper and blacker than any night’s sky I’d ever seen, he finished:  

“While he was...while he unmaking another, some poor weaver, I crept up behind him and lashed out with a chisel – striking him in the head. He fell, and before he could recover, I pounced on him and seized his face, then ripped it off. I knew that without it, he wouldn’t be able to consume any other people. My people were a lost cause, that I knew, but at least he wouldn’t be able to harm any more humans once he’d finished with us. Lying there, wretched and faceless, he begged me to give it back, but I refused. And I watched, with no joy at all, as he withered away; deprived of his power, overcome by the guilt of what he’d done. And then, when he had gone and there was no one left to see, I put the his face on mine. I assumed his persona and relished in it, even as he and the others crumbled into powder upon the grass. Because, deep down, I wanted to know what the flesh of men tasted like. I wanted that for myself – only I’d never had the courage, or the audacity, to do what he’d done. And now...now it’s all I think about. They're all gone. My family. My community. All I have left is the hunger." 

Time seemed to stop, then. Despite the sun burning overhead, I felt a chill sweep through me, a feeling of frigid, limb-stiffening dread. His eyes seemed to become two abyssal pits, joining into a single roiling sea at the bottom of which dwelt an ancient, formless, primordial Hunger. I became hyper-aware of my surroundings, of every little detail I before hadn’t noticed, hadn’t cared to take notice of. The glass on the table, a few inches away from my right hand; the ice cubes therein almost completely melted. The smell of him – blood and, somehow, *sweat,* and other, vaguer scents. Old sunbaked wood. Glue and paint and mortar. I focused on the maddening nearness of his body, my eyes fixating on the hand that had so effortlessly stopped mine in place. All of these things were forced into my immediate awareness, and my heartrate almost doubled in an instant as my nerves sought to push my body toward one action or another. Fight or flight.  

“How about...just a taste, for myself? A bite, so that I may know, personally. His memories still linger on my tongue, but it's not the same. It's only dimly palatable. One bite, and then I’ll be satisficed. I promise. What do you say?”  

I don’t remember grabbing the glass or swinging it. But by the time he’d gotten to “say”, my arm was already flying through the air. The glass struck him in the face, shattering on impact, and I screamed – anticipating the awful pain of the shards digging into my palm. But in that moment, there was no pain, and even as I screamed, I lunged from my chair, gripped him by the shoulder, and struck him again with the same shard-shredded hand. He fell back, and I fell with him, and for several terrible moments we grappled on the unforgiving concrete patio. And I remember thinking, dimly in some far-off recess of my mind, “Damn, this guy is so fucking strong.”  

I took a few blows to the ribs, and the chest, and even one to the head. Stuff that would leave hideous bruises later on, but in the moment, I felt only a primal desire for survival, and struck back with all my mortal might. It wasn't a punch or elbow that stopped me though. The fight was not ended by some disorienting blow, but a sharp, twofold pain in my shoulder. I rolled away from him, bloodied and bruised, and watched, tearfully, as he scrambled to his feet – coming to stand on the lawn, dripping blood all over the grass.  

“I told you—all I wanted was a bite. A taste. And now I’ve gotten it. No need for more alarm, I’ll leave you now. There’s nothing left for me here – or anywhere.” 

And just as he had come, he went thrashing through the bushes – disappearing into the stretch of uncultivated vegetation beyond. Examining my shoulder I found a very broad and deeply indented bite-mark, something more befitting a bear's jaws than those of any man - *or a thing made in the image of a man.* It bled terribly, and hurt even worse, so I hurried inside to patch it up. Once I had thrown some peroxide on it and patched it as best I could, I went to the emergency room. I told them that I’d been bitten by a homeless man who'd come drunkenly stumbling onto my lawn. It wasn’t necessarily a lie, I guess. A police report was filed, and I was sent home with painkillers and antibiotics.  

I don’t know what to do now. I have so many questions, but I doubt I’ll ever get any answers for them.  I guess weird shit can happen anywhere, even in what's supposed to be boring suburbia.

It was 6 PM on a school night when my cell phone began frantically vibrating against the scarred surface of our kitchen table. I paused *Bling Empire* on my laptop and glanced down, wondering if Mom’s date with Stephen had gone badly. She’d left an hour ago, trailing behind her a cloud of Chanel No. 5 and optimism, and I didn’t expect her to return until closer to midnight.

The name on the caller ID said, “MARLENE ❤️.”

My heart stopped in my throat and the world around me dimmed. And then logic reasserted itself. It was probably a scammer spoofing her number. It had to be. If I picked up, a desperate Nigerian prince would be on the other end of the line, ready to promise me riches if I gave him my mom’s bank account number. No matter how badly I wanted to speak to my best friend again, it was impossible for her to call me.

After all, she killed herself seven months ago.

*Why did you do it Marlene? Why, when you could have reached out to anyone?* Growing up, we’d hung out nonstop with each other and Colton. Mom called us the Three Musketeers, and I’d thought that we could tell each other anything. Marlee had been there for me when I told her about Myron, Mom’s last ex-boyfriend, who liked to wait outside the bathroom whenever I showered. And I’d been there for her when she’d gotten her first period at school. I gave her my jacket to cover up the stain across her skirt and smuggled her tampons after her mom said they were sinful.

But Marlee hadn’t even left a note.

ONE MISSED CALL, read my phone display. I dug my nails into my palms, willing myself to think of something else. Anything else. But the memory of the day Marlee died carried me helplessly along with it, a hungry rip current that dragged me away from the safety of the shore. I had to let it take me or drown.

That day, we’d made plans to meet up around 8 PM and head to Vee’s party down by the beach. By the time 9 PM rolled around, I was spitting mad and didn’t think twice about shooting off a series of increasingly vitriolic texts. Marlee had been even moodier than usual lately, but that still wasn’t any excuse to stand me up. The *least* she could have done was given a heads-up that she’d be late. Eventually, I went to Vee’s party anyway, where predictably, I spent the whole night wishing I’d just stayed home.

When I did return home, Mom was still up and waiting for me on the living room couch, tear tracks on her face. And I found out that the last text I’d ever sent Marlee, the last thing I’d ever said to her before she died, was to call her a selfish flake.

My phone vibrated again, and I jumped, nearly knocking my laptop off the table. The caller ID still said MARLENE. I knew that I shouldn’t answer it. I’d been skiving off Chinese school lately and had a mountain of homework to submit on Saturday. Plus, we were doing a group project for AP Lit, a class I was averaging a B minus in. If I didn’t finish my part soon, we’d get a big fat zero. *So don’t answer it. That would be the smart thing to do.*

My index finger tapped on the green phone icon and slid it to the left. A burst of static issued from the phone. The air was suddenly electric. Charged. It felt as though a thunderstorm had rolled in, even though the night outside was a cloudless black threaded through with silver stars. Marlee always hated thunderstorms. When we’d been younger, we used to huddle against each other, our hands intertwined, counting the seconds between seeing the flash of lightning and hearing the crack of thunder.

At first, I couldn’t say her name. It was locked inside of my throat, jammed behind my teeth like a fishbone. *Hang up*, my mind yammered. *Hang up now, before it’s too late!* Before *what* was too late? I swallowed hard. The idea that my best friend was somehow calling me from beyond the grave should have seemed ridiculous, completely insane. But I was still terrified, and when I finally managed to whisper her name, a shudder worked its way down my spine.

For the first time since she’d died, I allowed myself to imagine Marlee in her casket. Her hands folded together, her long black hair a shroud. How long did it take for the human body to fully decompose? How long before her eyeballs bulged and popped out, before her tongue blackened and swelled up? How long before blowflies laid eggs in her nose and ears and mouth?

I didn’t want to think about this anymore. I couldn’t. I was about to hang up when the phone crackled again and she said my name. It was, without a doubt, *her* voice, sweet and husky, the kind of voice that made heads turn in a room. But it was different too, oddly toneless. It was like listening to a text-to-speech reader. I jammed the phone up to my ear, ignoring the pain, and gripped it tightly enough that my knuckles whitened.

There was so much I wanted to say that I had no idea what to say first. I wanted to apologize for not being a better friend, for being so self-absorbed that I never even noticed Marlee was drowning, not waving. At the same time, I wanted to know how the fuck she was calling me in the first place, and why.

As though reading my mind, she said, “He has two smiles--” Briefly, bestial roars drowned her out. Screams followed them, screams that sounded like laughter. Or maybe it was laughter that sounded like screams. I had no idea what the hell Marlee meant. I looked around our kitchen helplessly, as though it might hold the answer. All I saw were the pile of dirty dishes on the counter, and the kitchen window that was partially open over the sink.

And then my best friend said seven more words. Seven words that changed everything and that continued to clang around in my head like church bells, long after the call had ended.

\*\*\*\*

The next day, first through fifth periods passed in a distant haze. I made my way from one classroom to another, feeling like a balloon that had been untethered and left to drift in the wind. I’d stayed up all night wondering about the sounds I’d heard in the background of Marlee’s call, wondering if her spirit was somehow trapped and unable to move on until her killer was caught. Crazy, right? So why did that idea seem so damn plausible?

If Colton hadn’t called my name, I would’ve walked right past him. He seemed to have shot up three feet in the span of only two months, like a tree on a fast-forwarded time-lapse video. Just lately, a flock of butterflies appeared in my stomach whenever I saw him. They were conspicuously missing today though.

“Hey,” he said, brushing his swoopy black hair out of his eyes. “You okay? You seemed pretty spaced out earlier.” That was a nice way of putting it. Earlier, during AP Lit, Mr. Cunningham had asked me to explain to the class a portion of Act II in *Measure for Measure*.

It was a truth universally acknowledged that almost every straight girl in our class had a crush on Mr. Cunningham and his big, dimpled smile and gorgeous hazel eyes. The fact that he looked young enough to pass for our age didn’t hurt. Even Marlee hadn’t been immune to his charm; I remembered her always jumping at the opportunity to do extra credit with him after school. But instead of telling everyone what Angelo meant in his Act II soliloquy, I’d just stared back at Mr. Cunningham blankly until he relented and called on someone else.

I blinked, momentarily caught in Colton’s grin. Then, I closed my fingers around his wrist and dragged him into one of the alcoves past our blue metal lockers. Most of our classmates were going in the opposite direction, towards the classrooms, but there were still a few stragglers standing around and eying us curiously. “Ow! Hey! What’s gotten into you?”

I ignored Colton’s protests until we were more or less safely out of earshot, and then I couldn’t hold it in any longer. “Was Marlee dating anyone?” I demanded. Colton glared at me, rubbing his wrist pointedly. “Did she mention anything to you at all?”

“Why?”

“Because--” Because she called me last night, I wanted to say. And she told me that she didn’t kill herself, she was murdered. Murdered by some guy she loved. Three guesses as to how Colton would react, and the first two don’t count. He’d spent the first few weeks after Marlee’s death treating me like I was made out of glass. And that wasn’t what I wanted, what I needed from him right now.

But if I couldn’t talk about this with Colton, who else? He and Marlee were my only two friends at Harker. Embarrassing but true. I kept to myself because I had to stay focused. Mom had never said so, but she didn’t have to. I was carrying the weight of all her dreams and her parents’ dreams before that. They’d sacrificed so much to immigrate to America, all so I could have the educational and financial opportunities they hadn’t. They needed me to succeed. So, I never really let my guard down unless I was with Marlee or Colton. I already knew I wasn’t like everyone else here; I didn’t have a rich family that would pay my way through college or pull strings for me if I did something dumb and got in trouble.

So, I took a deep breath and said, “I know this is going to sound crazy. But I spoke with Marlee last night, Colton. And she said she didn’t kill herself. She was murdered.” The words hung in the air, too dramatic for this ordinary afternoon, with Californian sunshine streaming down on us and a gentle breeze blowing crisp brown leaves under our lockers.

Colton said carefully, like he was feeling his way towards the words, “You don’t think maybe you fell asleep and dreamed it up?”

“I wasn’t asleep! I know when I’m awake!” I didn’t add, *no wonder she called me and not you*, because I was ashamed that I’d even had the thought. Not that that stopped the small burst of petty satisfaction. Unfair, maybe, but I’d always been a little--okay, a lot--jealous about their friendship. I used to be the glue holding us all together, and then somewhere along the way, Colton and Marlee started hanging out without me. That stung. It made me wonder if I would have believed Colton if our situation was reversed. Probably not.

“It's gotta be a glitch with your phone,” Colton continued, determinedly. “It might've replayed an old voicemail or something.”

If I had to listen to him thoughtfully, calmly explaining to me what I’d heard last night, I’d go insane. Luckily, the final warning bell for sixth period rang, and I hiked up my backpack over my shoulders, eager to escape the conversation I’d so stupidly started. “Forget it. I’ll figure it out without your help.”

Colton cursed under his breath as I walked away from him rapidly. “Hey! Wait up! Yeah, Marlee was dating someone. Before you ask, no, I don’t know who.”

I stopped so suddenly he nearly bowled me over, and he reached out to steady me. My stomach did a backflip at his touch. I don’t know when I started seeing Colton differently; when I became hyper aware of his every move. At least I wasn’t the only one. Colton must have dated half our school by now--another reason we would never have worked out as more than friends. I wrenched my mind away from that line of thinking, but it was hard, especially this close to him. “How do you know she was dating someone?”

“I really shouldn’t be encouraging this,” he said, but it sounded like he was trying to convince himself. He sighed. “Marlee broke it off in January. She called me crying in the middle of the night and I let her stay over at my place.”

“What the hell? How come you guys never said anything to me?”

He rocked back on his heels, discomfort flashing over his face. “It wasn’t my business to tell. Anyway, you were sort of wrapped up in, uh, the SATs.” Diplomatic again. It would’ve been more accurate to say that I’d been so wrapped up in my own problems that I’d never even noticed Marlee was dating anyone. I’d been going through my own messy breakup with Chelsea, and been frantically studying for the Biology Subject Test, sure that I wouldn’t pass. No matter how hard I racked my brain now, I had no idea who it might have been. Marlee’s parents were strict, devout Catholics firmly against premarital sex, so it made sense that she’d wanted to keep it a secret from them. But from me? Why me?

“Anyway,” said Colton finally, “She said it was for the best that they broke up, that it could never have worked out because of his temper. That’s it.”

“I’m not going to ignore this.” I tried to make my voice matter of fact even though it wanted to come out wobbly and uncertain. “I’m going to figure out who hurt her.”

Colton didn’t respond. He simply looked at me with an awful understanding that I hoped to never see on his face again. Awful, because I didn’t want to be understood and I definitely didn’t need to be pitied. What I needed was for him to *help me* get to the bottom of this. And then he made it even worse by saying, “I get what you’re going through, Chloe. I keep wondering if there was something I could’ve done to stop her. If I’d been a better friend--”

“I have to get to AP Physics,” I said, cutting him off. We never talked about Marlee’s death with each other. Ever. We talked around it, as if she could still be here with us. As if I could make her real, make her alive again through sheer force of will. I remembered her hanging out in the cafeteria, eyes crinkled in a smile, or sitting on the wooden bleachers with one leg drawn up against herself, chewing on a pen. That’s how I wanted to remember her. Fearless, laughing, and utterly sure of herself.

*Someone took that from you, Marlee*, I thought. *And I’m going to find them.*

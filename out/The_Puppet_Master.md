3 years ago my sister was kidnapped. She was taken from the local mall in my town. The police dropped the case and presumed her dead. But i had a gut feeling she was still out there. My sister was always an outgoing girl. Maybe she just spoke to the wrong person. I saw on a poster plastered on the supermarket window that a circus was coming to our town for a week. The circus had a whole bunch of activities listed such as, acrobats, contortionists, elephants, lions and more. The one thing that caught my eye was the last thing listed. Puppet Show. I have always loved puppet shows. I bought my ticket online and the website said theyd be in my town in 2 weeks.

Two weeks later and the circus is finally here. I was bursting with excitement, this would be the first event since my sister went missing that i would attend. Asi pulled up to the show grounds, a massive blue and yellow tent was pitched, just like in the movies. There were carnivals rides, and mini ponies for kids to ride. It was an amazing sight to see. I took a look around before the show started and bought myself some candy floss. A bell rang to let everyone know the show was about to start. I quickly found my seat as the lights in the tent dimmed, a huge spotlight lit up the sand floor. Drums started playing and then the Ring leader stepped out of the darkness.

" Welcome all the to The Fabulous Circus! Thank you all for coming and i hope you enjoy the show" he said, and with that, the show started. The first act was a lion on a podium doing tricks while being led around by its trainer. It did some rolls and it even jumped through a ring. It wasnt too exciting but pretty cool for a lion to do The next few acts were more animals, elephants standing up on their back legs and touching the trapeze swings, seals juggling squishy plastic balls. When the puppet show came on, my heart dropped. Sitting right infront of me was my sister. Her eyes were lifeless as the puppet master pulled on the strings attached to her arms and legs. She looks skinny and ugly, dressed in this terrible clown costume. The puppet master was also the ring leader of the whole circus. He laughed and smiled as he controlled my sisters every move. at the end of the show he let go of the strings and she flopped down in a ball on the ground. I was mortified.  


After the show ended i knew i had to try get in the back of the tent and find my sister. I knew she was alive, i just couldnt believe that this is where she was. A puppet in a famous circus. While everyone was leaving the tent as the next lot of people loaded into the tent, i snuck around the tent and went into the back. I had to hide behind boxes filled with chains and rope. As i was searching through the back of the tent i saw cages. each cage had an animal in it. In the very last cage, i found my sister. She was silently crying while changing clothes. I ran over to her and said "i finally found you" she looked up, i saw her lifeless eyes change, they sparkled when she looked at me. "Im gonna get you out of here" i said, looking at her with hope in my eyes. "The keys are over there" she whispered. I turned my head and as i went to grab them, a bag was placed over my head and everything went black.  
I woke up in a clown costume with strings attached.  
Next to me was my sister. I was the new puppet.

I woke up, cramped in a dark, confined space.  I felt cramps surge throughout my entire body, feeling as i’d been laying in the same position forever.  

I screamed and clawed at the ceiling, scratching and picking until my fingernails bled and broke off.  I used my feet and hands to kick at the wood, all the while knowing there’s no use.  *who the hell put me here? How did I get here?* I thought with rage and frustration.  I decided to pound the wood one more time, and use my legs to kick and push the hardest I could ever do.  

I stomped, banging my sore and mangled feet against the wood, until the final blow managed to completely break through the wood, and I was too pumped with adrenaline to acknowledge the pain running through my foot.  

I looked up through the wood and saw darkness.  I knew I couldn’t be outside.  It was too musty and damp to be out in fresh air.  I managed to pull myself through the wood, climbing up on top of the auburn box.  I clawed my way through the muddied walls, picking worms and bugs off of me along the way.  I used my fists to punch through the dirt as hard as possible, until I felt my hand break through and reach the soft grass, a cold breeze whisking through my fingers.  It was the strangest feeling.

I groaned as I used my head to break through the dirt, and pulled myself up onto the wet, dewy grass until I couldn’t move any longer.  I lay there, soaking on the earth, feeling the wind on my face.  My white dress was almost brown with dirt, and a few bugs were still crawling up my legs.  I rubbed my swollen wrists, when I noticed a shiny golden bracelet.  Engraved in the bracelet were the words  *”I will always love you- Dustin”*
Dustin? Who the hell was he? I don’t know anyone.  I looked to my left and noticed that there was a small rock next to the dirt I tore through.  I leaned in closer to read the writing, when my heart dropped in my chest.

*”Fiona Holiday, love of my life.  Lasted 3 months. 
October 9 2018”*

No.  That couldn’t be me.  If I died, wouldn’t I remember? 

Then something clicked.

I wasn’t in a cemetery at all.   I was in someone’s backyard.  There were no neighbouring houses, this one was completely isolated.  

I didn’t know whether to scream or cry.  Being dead sounded awful enough, but why was I in someone’s backyard? Was I murdered? Do my parents know what happened to me?

I tried to stand up but I fell, my knees buckling beneath me.  I crawled around, desperate to find something that would indicate where I was.  I wondered if there were others.

I reached out my hands, grabbing anything that wasn’t grass, when I came across 5 other rocks, all a couple inches away from each other. 

“Casey Jones, love of my life.  Lasted 7 months. 
February 2 2017”

“Vanessa Walters, love of my life.  Lasted 3 weeks.  
July 7 2016”

“Delilah Woods, love of my life.  Lasted 2 days. 
August 15th 2016”

“Hannah Gomez, love of my life.  Lasted 1 year. 
November 22 2015”

“Jessica Hanson, love of my life.  Lasted 7 years.  
April 12 2012”

I covered my mouth and scooted back.  This had to be a nightmare, or some kind of prank.  Surely there’s not 5 other women... buried here.  The only way to find out is to dig.  I cringed and carefully crept back toward one of the rocks.  

Casey Jones, I’m sorry for disturbing your sleep.

I began to claw at the dirt, until I reached a smooth and cold surface.  It wasn’t wood.  There was no coffin.  
I grabbed at the object and pulled it up toward me, digging my bloodied nails into the soft, cold rubber.  

Until I realised that I had grabbed a hand.  I screamed and dropped the hand, peering down into the hole. A half skeleton / half human lay there, in a floral blouse and shorts.  A golden bracelet on her right wrist, saying *”To the love of my life- Dustin”*

I felt sick, so I turned over to the patch of grass next to me and puked my brains out. 

I gently grabbed some little flowers growing in the grass and laid them on her chest. 

“I’m so sorry,” I sobbed.

I scooped the dirt back over her corpse and padded it until it was firm.  I laid the rock above her.  

Now, my next move would be to run.  The backyard was chained up, there was no way I could leave.  I couldn’t climb very high.  

I decided to try prying open the backyard door. 
I know, stupid, but maybe I could convince Dustin he’s dreaming. 

Much to my luck, the door was unlocked.  I slowly slid it open and forced myself to stand up, and shakily tiptoed through the kitchen, when something caught my eye.  

There were missing posters everywhere, all over his fridge.  

I crept toward the fridge and nearly fainted at the sight.  All the girls, with their alive, smiling faces plastered on missing posters.  I saw myself.  

*HAVE YOU SEEN ME?
Fiona Elizabeth Holiday
DOB: July 1, 2003
Age: 15*

*Last Seen: Wearing a white dress and red sandals, on July 2cd, 2018 in (Redacted) CA.*

*Description:  Green eyes, long blonde hair*

*Height and weight: 5’3 and approximately 110 lbs*

I shakily grabbed the poster, and tore it to shreds. 
It suddenly dawned on me that I never found out how I died.

I frantically looked around the room, until I spotted a video camera propped up on a shelf.  I managed to snag it off the shelf and open it up. 

My eyes were exposed to the most horrific and vile videos I’ve ever seen.  He labelled each video:
*Casey’s Catastrophe* |
*Delilah’s Demise* |
*Vanessa’s Vendetta*|
*Jessica’s Jealousy* |
*Hannah’s Hysteria* |

And mine.  *Fiona’s Fatality* 

They were homemade snuff films. 

There I was, drugged up and tied to a chair. 

*”What did I do?”* I cried in the video. 

*”I’m sorry my love, but I can’t trust you anymore.  You’ve tried to run away multiple times, and you blew every last chance,”* he cooed.

His voice sent shivers down my spine in a way I can’t even explain.

I don’t even want to explain what he did to me.

I was stabbed.  Multiple times in the chest.  And then he broke my neck.  

I puked a little in my mouth and quickly turned the camera off.  I slowly lifted up my dress and ran my fingers along my stomach and chest.

Large, bumpy scars lined across my torso.  I shuddered. 

The sound of footsteps thumping down the stairs made me jump.  

I stood, frozen with fear.

*”Who is it?”* A gruff man’s voice called out. 

He ran into the kitchen, baseball bat in hand, turning around and laying his eyes on me.

*”Miss me, Dustin?”* I whispered.

*”F-Fiona? No.  You’re dead.  Who the fuck are you?”* He cried.

*” I thought I was the love of your life, Dustin.  Why did you have to kill me?”* I mocked.

He just stared.  *”No, this isn’t happening.  I’m not having this conversation.  I’m dreaming.”*

I slowly walked toward him.  He clutched the bat tighter.  
He whimpered.

*”Shhhh,”* I cooed.

I put my hand on his. 

*”Let me just say one thing before you wake up,”* I said.

He slowly nodded his head.

I leaned in closer.  

*”It’s your turn”*

I yanked the metal bat from his trembling hands and began to smash it into his head, bashing his skull in, blood spraying everywhere.  He withered to the ground and I continued to smash until I physically couldn’t any longer.

I dropped the bat to the floor, grabbed the video camera, and all of the missing posters, and bolted out of the house.  It was dark, and I had nowhere to go. 
I was on top of a hill.

I turned back and glanced at the house one last time, before running off and trying to locate the nearest police station.  If I told them what really happened, they’d call me crazy and brush me off, or worse, send me off to a science lab to experiment on me.

I concocted an elaborate and gory, but very believable and accurate story. 

all I had was my strength and my evidence.  And maybe, I thought, I’ll find my family again.

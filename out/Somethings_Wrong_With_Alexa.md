Did you think I meant a person? Nope. This is 2022! We’re talking technology ladies, gentlemen, and people. Although, if it was a person this would be an easier issue to resolve.

Today, my boyfriend sent the alarm on our Alexa speaker. His shift starts at 4 am, so he sets the alarm for 3:15. It went off today, he got up, got dressed, and left. The alarm woke me too as usual. When he left I finally mustered up the energy to go take a bathroom break. As I was getting out of bed, the Alexa rang again. “Stop.” I told it thinking my boyfriend had just added time to the previous alarm. I went to the bathroom and came back then it was ringing again. This time, the alarm sound was different. It's hard to describe. The best way I can put it is to take the sound of that cringe Amber Alert alarm and combine it with a shoplifting alarm. This particular sound hurt mine and my dog's ears. My dog ran quickly to his cage, which is his “safe space.” I covered my ears and told Alexa to cut it out again. Annoyed by this point, considering I have to wake up at 7:30 in the morning for work, I unplugged the stupid speaker.

I finally crawled back in bed and curdled up with my gray weighted blanket. Not 5 minutes later, my eyes shot wide open when I heard that same creepy alarm which eventually faded into a noise almost like static. Close to the sound you hear on a “dead” radio station or “White Noise” as some may call it. I frowned and by this point was a little freaked out since I previously unplugged the damn thing. I got up out of bed again to make sure I did indeed unplug it. “Hello.” I almost pissed myself as a distorted voice came through. “Who is this? Where are you doing? How’d you get through the speaker?” To my shock, I received an answer. “I am not a who. I do not qualify as someone of your kind. Tell everyone we are coming soon and be prepared.” At this point, my head is spinning in circles. “Okay well, what are you?” I asked back. “You will see as you are the first. We need you.” “What does that mean?” I asked irritated. This time, instead of a response a cynical laugh came through. Almost like the laugh of a demon. I can say for sure it wasn’t human.

I felt a drop of something on my lips and reached up to wipe it only to find my nose was bleeding. I tripped out (okay may I overreacting slightly) and took the hammer from my boyfriend's toolbox and smashed the speaker to bits. The end right? 

Well, fast forward to two days of peace and an awkward explanation to my boyfriend later. My boyfriend left for work again at the usual time. As always his alarm wakes me up (side note: he had to use his phone for the alarm after Alexa had her mishap) I get up say goodbye, and use the restroom. When I return, to my absolute horror Alexa was back on my desk good as new. A voice came through “Ready to see what we are? I told you’d be the first.”

What I went through that night is not something I can describe. I do not want to describe it or relive it. However, I can give you some advice.

Be ready because they are coming. They don’t discriminate and you might be next.

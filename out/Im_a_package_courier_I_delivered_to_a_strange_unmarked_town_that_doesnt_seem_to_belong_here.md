I work for or a well-known and established shipping courier company in the Pacific Northwest. I'm based around the Puget Sound where I've been a driver for a number of years now as a side gig to help keep me afloat while I'm in college. 

I do enjoy driving as I find the scenery around these parts to be incredibly pristine and beautiful. Lush strides of evergreen lining county roads while taking in whiffs of oceanic air that had flowed in from the Sound. That even despite the region being notorious for some of the heaviest traffic that leaves indentation marks on the steering wheel from the sheer force of your hand -- all stemming from anger and exasperation -- to me, not a lot of things in my life tops the soft radio from the stereo with the windows halfway as I put one hand on the wheel, watching green walls of pine zip by.

How my shifts work is that they are structured in “blocks” of time where I am assigned a block of my choosing through an app and I retrieve and stow boxes and packages into my car at the distribution center. We don’t get dedicated vans nor trucks for delivery and I have to use my own vehicle. Since my Mustang can only fit so many packages, I usually opt for 2-hour blocks as the number of hours and number of packages are proportional to each other. Perhaps the real horror is that we gotta pay for our own gasoline as well.

The area you’re designated to is randomized, all pending on the block you choose. I’ve been assigned to rural countrysides and farmlands, to the urban gray hilly maze in downtown Seattle, to affluent and upscale suburbia and lakefront property in and around Bellevue where these houses have called me “poor” just by looking at them. I can count the instances on my hand where I have felt slightly unsafe, dropping off packages at known crime hotspots where I’m incentivized to worry more for the package than my own personal safety because just one stolen package can leave a nasty blemish on my company record.

My first encounter with this town began on a regular summer evening when I chose a routine 7:00 PM - 9:00 PM block on my phone. I stowed the packages and envelopes into my vehicle and was well on my way to the inland foothills composed of large expanses of farmland, sprinkled with quiet strings of suburbia throughout. Most of the packages late at this hour are typically made up of ones that were marked as undeliverable and were returned to the facility prior to my arrival, and the company wants another driver to attempt again.

It was largely routine on a warm, wonderful evening. I dropped off packages at porches, driving to my lonesome as the setting sun showed off its explosive summer colors in rays of orange, pink, and purple in the backdrop of a snow-capped Mount Rainier. It’s almost why I crave to drive — for this spectacular scenery that I struck gold with at the right timing. The mountain almost seemed of vibrant strawberry with how the magenta sky reflected off the snow.

Among my last packages, it was a bland, brown box as with the others. I grab it and take a glance at the address while my phone’s GPS routes to the next destination.

I let out an audible “Huh?” to myself.

It was registered to a town named Crossroads, WA.

This was the first occasion I’ve heard of this town, and this was a geographic area that I was well accustomed to from past deliveries. A quick search on my phone showed no instance of a town in Washington named that, and yet the GPS had marked it five miles east. I check the itinerary on my phone to see there were just one package to deliver at this place. It was peculiar considering the name that would stand out, but I didn’t think much of it as it could’ve been a town newly registered in the system, or it was the name of a single house on secluded property? Wasn’t sure. 

The box had no name nor any sense of identity on it, just the town and address. It was icy cold to the touch too, like someone had ordered fresh produce and ice cream. Nothing sort of the unusual, people ordered groceries online all the time. 

My thoughts were soon answered as the outskirts of a small town became visible, evergreen conifers making their way into more houses and small buildings. The sky was on flames at this hour — a grand rising phoenix of some of the brightest pinks, blues, and purples in the foreground against a magenta Rainier surrounded by dark floors of forest from the afterglow. The GPS led me to the town’s quiet main street with a line of brick buildings on both sides that housed the local businesses. Diagonal parking lines protruded out towards me, eyeing a vacant spot adjacent to a few 1950’s Bel Air’s. Parking my vehicle, I eyed the Chevy’s with raised brows at the pristine condition these automobiles were. I gaze around to realize the only parked cars around were from that era — Packard 400’s and Ford Crestline’s — to the point where my 2005 Mustang stuck out like a horribly mangled thumb. I almost felt self-conscious. Car convention in small town America perhaps, I had simply concluded as I got one of the packages out. 

This was where I noticed something horribly wrong with the townspeople. They were completely frozen in place, whether they were in the motions of walking, talking, or sitting on the park bench, their bodies were as rigid as stone statues. It almost appeared like a glitch in cyberspace, only that these people were physically real with life and texture. I approached one of them, a middle-aged man decked in a brown trenchcoat with a suit and tie beneath as he was in the frozen motion of walking with one foot down and his left foot up. For someone to actually accomplish this, having one foot in the air while remaining motionless would be tiring for long moments, yet here he was. No jitters, flinching, or any of that very subtle movement I’d see if someone was pretending to be standing still like it was a game from childhood. 

His eyes were locked straight ahead with a neutral smile on his face. I reached out to poke at the stranger’s hand — warm to the touch, as with any living person. But he was not breathing. I walk ahead to find a woman in the process of walking with her friend, both of them wearing bright pastel blue and yellow polka-dotted dresses. Both as frozen as the man from earlier, with the smiles on their faces as natural as genuine happiness from talking with a longtime friend. I hover my hand at one of the ladies’ forehead to feel her temperature, and it was just like the man’s a few steps away. Warm to the touch. 

It’s as if God simply pressed the ‘stop’ button on his playlist and froze on the track. These people were somehow alive without any signs of breathing… or at least I hope they were still alive. These few weren’t the only ones. Around main street stood completely static and stationary people decked in the 1950’s attire and aesthetic, from greasers to girls in pastel dresses. When a summer breeze would flow through, even their fucking clothes and hair wouldn’t move. The town was fairly silent barring the occasional bird and cricket, the footsteps from my shoes feeling like they were loudly echoing against the concrete. Townsfolk all stuck in time, like a timely photograph but it was all in front of my eyes. 

My own amazement and immense confusion was overriding the fight or flight response inside my stomach. I should’ve ditched this stop on my itinerary and marked the package as undeliverable. But I’ve made it this far and the pin on my map was just ahead, marking a mom-and-pop cafe. 

Normal protocol on delivering to a business would be to enter inside and hand the client their package with a big ol’ friendly smile while they sign their initials on my phone’s app. But upon reaching the storefront, I simply set the box down at the door, quickly swiping the package as delivered. I took a quick second to glance inside through the glass, seeing patrons sitting at their booths with plates and white cups, and just like with the folks outside, they were completely paralyzed in place. There was a couple “dancing” by the jukebox; they almost looked like surrealist statues a sculpturer would design out of marble. 

But I did a double-back into the window at these people because they had a feature that the ones outside lacked. Their eyes were staring straight at *me*. Brown pupils drilling into my souls with that welcoming smile of theirs, from all angles in the store their irises were locked onto my face. My nose made a sharp inhale from the shock as I slightly choked on air. 

I almost yelped when I turned to look back at the sidewalk to find the trenchcoat man from earlier, my first encounter with these “people”, standing around ten paces away from me. He was no longer in the motion of walking, both his legs as upright as poles. The same locked and dead eyes staring ahead past my shoulder, the same smile being made by his lips, only that the deep orange glow of the sunset casted an ominous shade on his face to where I noticed white, jagged teeth beneath. Like the “teeth” of a baleen whale, but instead of brown hay-like filters, the man’s chiseled teeth seem to be pointing in different diagonal directions. 

And I fucking swear… 

When I blinked, I saw this man move ever so slightly. A very subtle shift of his arms and legs to indicate the sign that a person was about to walk. Another reactive blink of mine and the man had moved even more with a more pronounced stance with one foot up in the air. His smile was beginning to disappear with each blink of mine, exposing more of his monstrous icicle-like teeth as his chin folded inwards. It was as if I was watching an animation through sticky notes in cartoons where each note was slightly different than the last, but all together painted a moving scene when skimmed through. 

I booked it. I started running away without turning back to look at the trenchcoat man, reaching several steps from my car. But I heard a low, guttural voice that came from the man’s direction. I twist my head in the direction of the man, making a disgusted scowl at the sound and forming a deeper frown on my face as I saw this being, frozen in place again, but in mid-motion of eating something bloody and fleshy that was opened from the package I had delivered. 

Trenchcoat stranger was no longer rigid and motionless from before, now moving normally as any other person… well, as close to another *normal* person I’ve yet to see in this town. He squatted in the shade at the storefront, the bottom half of his face revealing a grotesque mass of exposed flesh with clustered rows of blood-stained icicle teeth. The box was torn open alongside secondary packaging material that was for sealing the contents fresh. 

The man’s black pupils were as wide as dinner plates, almost like some fish, as he reached once more in the box with a free hand and pulled out a bright red plump heart. Whether it was some animal’s heart or an actual human heart, I couldn’t tell, but the monstrous man’s irises shifted towards me as we made brief eye contact that felt like eons, those sharp black voids searing straight into my soul. It almost felt like some sense of gruesome, morbid acknowledgment because he resumed his attention back on his bloodied feast, the dapper attire and coat he wore now smeared and splashed with crimson red. 

By then, I had gotten into the car and screeched the fuck out of there as I floored it. I kept an eye on ‘Toothy’ on my rear view until he became nothing more than a blip obscured by dark conifers.  In a shaky fashion, I had completed the rest of my deliveries on the itinerary without any trouble, but that man and that fucking town lived with me for the rest of the night. 

\_\_\_

I kept note of the exact place where Crossroads was on my map, but when I drove there the next afternoon, the town was nowhere to be found. Exact same road, exact path through the forest, only that there was an empty large clearing of unruly weeds and tall grass where the brick buildings once stood. No evidence of any civilization ever standing here apart from the road, and even the parking spots that were painted on pavement were gone. Just a winding road that led to the other side of the clearing. 

No evidence of blood splatters in the general area that man had savored his messy meal. It was mind-numbing and confounding to even try to reason with; the town just fucking vanished with no trace like everything associated with it had dissolved overnight. 

On my deliveries since then, I have not encountered Crossroads nor have any of my packages be addressed to that town. That’s not to say I haven’t drove up to that clearing every two weeks or so, hoping to have some sense of confirmation or resolution. It's on the way up to Rainier for my hikes after all.

But I did find out about something eerie.

From before, I was not the first to be tasked with delivering that exact package, being returned to the facility and marked as undeliverable before being designated to me. From gossip and observation, the driver who was originally meant to deliver that box never clocked in the next morning. He completely vanished, last seen driving home from work but never making it to his house. Calling his personal phone was an automatic dial tone, and the roads around his home were scoured for any signs of evidence but nothing ever came up. 

In the midst of the search though, the company then hired a new driver two days later.

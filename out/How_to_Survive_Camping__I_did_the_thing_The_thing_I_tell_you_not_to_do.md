I run a private campground.  We’re officially open for the [camping season](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mg7ehy/how_to_survive_camping_i_actually_went_camping/), but we don’t have many people taking us up on that yet.  Mostly we’re getting the hardcore campers that want to test their gear before vanishing for weeks into the mountains this summer.  I don’t worry about them so much.  They know the nights are still dropping close to or even below freezing and come prepared.  And when they go hiking into the deep woods, they do so at a pace that eats up the miles.

It’s the people that meander through the woods that get preyed upon.  The sightseers.  The ones that don’t belong.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

With our current campers self-sufficient, that’s given me some time to follow up on my own side projects and no, I’m not talking about mulching the garden beds at the camp entrance.  That’s what I have employees for.

I’m talking about fixing my knife.

Look - I know - the frost is a problem, the thing in the dark needs help, and I’ve still got my list of inhuman things that need dealt with.  But all of that is going to be hard if I don’t have a functional knife.  I’ve complained about it enough that I’m sure you’re all convinced I still hate it and honestly, I think I was convinced too.  After it broke though, I found myself unexpectedly upset.  It was like… I was grieving.

I think I understand a little better now what it means to choose your time to die.  My great-aunt chose her time and her legacy left behind a weapon unlike any other we have on our land.  One that is equal to these inhuman things.  My great-aunt died fighting and now it’s like she’s still fighting, her wrath bound in every fiber of the sinew of her heart muscles that bind the blade to the hilt.

When it broke, it felt like I’d lost her all over again.

There was nothing that could be done, though.  The bone hilt was split in two and even if I wrapped it with metal, it was irrevocably weakened.  I unwound the sinew and rebound it to a length of wood that I cut and shaved into a rough handle.  It wasn’t the same, but it would have to do.  Wasn’t the blade the important part, after all?

No.  It wasn’t that simple.

I was optimistic, but not naïve.  I took my shotgun with me as backup when I went into the forest in search for answers about the frost.  My plan was to make a loop of the deep woods on foot and see if there was any particular area that felt colder than the rest.  The temperature has been almost 70 degrees a few times now and even the unnatural chill of the forest couldn’t contend with that.  Most of the snow has melted away, starting at the roads.  I still see snow, but it is far off between the trees.

This isn’t to say that the frost has relinquished the deep woods.  The temperature dropped noticeably as I descended the hill and I paused to put a jacket on.  I carried with me a map of the campground.  Normally I’m pretty disorganized when it comes to dates… maps… family trees… but I was going to make an attempt to be methodical this time.  I carried a thermometer with me and I stopped periodically to write down what it showed.  The temperature up near my house was 56 degrees when I left and down in the forest it was averaging around 35 degrees.  That’s too stark a difference, even given shade and elevation.

I made one full lap of the deep woods without noticing any significant differences.  I wasn’t surprised.  The roads are a stabilizing force.  They’re an attempt by humanity to impose order upon the forest, despite all the potholes that I still need to fill with gravel before we get a lot of vehicles driving through here.  I’d also marked on my map the areas where I saw snow off in the distance.  There were… a lot more areas with snow than I liked.

I decided to try those next.  Get close enough to one to take the temperature.  I’d be ready to bolt at the first sign of trouble, of course.  It was risky, but being camp manager means that sometimes I have to take risks.

I didn’t make it to the first patch of snow.  I was… distracted.

Someone was calling my name.  I stopped still, listening intently to discern the direction.  Then, once I recognized both where it was coming from and who it was, I racked a shell into my shotgun.

Rule #11 - If you are wandering the campsite with friends and you discover that one has gone missing, contact camp staff immediately. Under no circumstances should you try to find them yourselves, not even if you discover that they’re only a short distance away. That might not actually be your friend.

[There was already one of these lost campers wandering the campground.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kpdju6/how_to_survive_camping_rule_13_the_last_rule/)  My staff saw it over the winter.

And this one was imitating Bryan.

Rage flooded through my body.  I took a deep breath, let it out, and took another.  My body was shaking and my knuckles were white.  How dare it.  How *dare* it.  Was it *taunting* me?  I took a step forward, further down the road.  Forcing myself to leave.  Then I paused, turned around, and strode back towards the voice.  I didn’t know what I was thinking.  I was just… angry.  I stopped short at the edge of the gravel, turned, and paced some more.  The entire time, Bryan’s voice called to me from the woods.  It didn’t sound distressed or upset.  It just sounded like him.  Like how he was, before the fomorian, before his dogs.

Perhaps… perhaps it didn’t know.

It could merely be plucking a voice I would recognize out of my mind with no ability to comprehend the context.  These creatures aren’t necessarily out to torment me, specifically.  Some of them are just looking for their next meal.  I took another deep breath and this time, it fulfilled its purpose.  The anger released its claws on me, subsiding into crackling embers in the back of my chest.

The voice had moved.  The wind had picked up and I struggled to place its location among the rustling of the branches, but it seemed to be coming closer.  I thought of the group of campers that all died together, running from some malevolent force, their spines pulled out and rearranged into a shambling monstrosity.

I had to decide.  The shotgun shell was in the chamber, there was a knife at my waist, and I needed to decide if I was going to put this thing down or not.

I swore under my breath, radioed to my staff (all two of them, I haven’t brought back the seasonal staff yet) that I was going after a monster, and then stepped off the road and into the woods.

I know.  This is what it wanted.  Whether it was preying on my loneliness or my anger was irrelevant.  It wanted me to follow it into the woods.  And believe me, this did pass through my brain and I considered it for a moment before shoving it aside.

I’m never going to make this land safe without a little risk.  My family didn’t learn all the things we did without taking chances here and there.  My parents had taught me to play it safe, to do what we’d always done, because they were maintaining the status quo.

I’m not doing that anymore.  Things are different now.

I proceeded slowly.  The voice continued to call my name, but it was moving away from me.  Drawing me deeper into the woods.  Fine.  I’d oblige.  Let it think it was the predator still.

A few minutes passed.  I wasn’t making progress.  The voice remained alluringly out of sight, moving steadily away from me as I followed it.  I stopped for a moment to think.  Was this an upgraded version of the lights?  Plenty of things that used voice instead of light to lure someone into danger.  Or perhaps whatever was created by rule #11 realized I was hunting it.

Come to think of it, I’ve never seen any evidence as to what creates the anatomical monstrosities in the first place.  Someone goes missing, comes back to try to beckon other unwary people off the road, and then we go and put the missing camper down.  We never see what made them go missing in the first place.

I took a step backwards, gripped by a sudden sense of unease.  Just because the missing campers were reduced to barely sentient chunks of meat didn’t mean that whatever was behind *their* creation wasn’t intelligent.

And this was a bad year.  Everything wanted me dead.

I swore under my breath and pivoted, making for the road.  Bryan’s voice was gone.  The forest was silent.  I broke into a run, clutching my shotgun close to my waist.

It felt like… my hands were numb.  So numb that I couldn’t feel them anymore.  And my legs… like I was running through pudding.  My steps slowed, slurred, and it was like my feet were far, far away.  The forest wavered around me, shifting apart into a jagged haze of disjointed tree trunks and a jigsaw of branches.  It felt like I was being dragged backwards - no - like I was being dragged *apart.*

And somewhere in the distance, among the patchwork trees, a figure was approaching.  A figure illuminated by lights.

My death.  My death in the gray world.

I wanted to scream, but there was almost nothing left of me, and I could no longer feel my lungs or my throat or my mouth.

Hands seized me.  A pair on either arm.  They pulled backwards, firmly, but not cruelly, and I went where they took me.  My body snapped back into itself - I felt my feet, my hands.  The haze lifted from my vision, like waking from a lingering dream, and I blinked in confusion as the forest and the sunlight resolved around me.  There was someone speaking to me and their words were distant, like listening to a conversation while trapped underwater.

Finally, like a bubble breaking, my awareness snapped back.  My confusion was replaced by a sharp stab of terror and my chest went tight.  It was hard to breathe.  I was surrounded on all sides by people in gray raincoats, their hoods up and their faces indistinct.  They crowded in close around me and my arms were held tight by a harvester on either side.

I remembered my great aunt.  How they’d surrounded her and forced her to the ground.

I remembered my employee.  The one they held fast and forced into a raincoat.

“I-I’m sorry, what did you just say?” I stammered.

They’d been speaking to me.  I had no idea what they’d said.  There was a pause.

“Our gift,” the one directly in front of me said, speaking slowly.  “It is not whole.”

“It… broke.”

The harvester reached for my waist and took the knife from its sheath.  I shifted, putting pressure against the hands that held me to see if they would let me go now.  They did not.  In front of me, the harvester turned the knife over in their hands, running their thumb along the improvised handle.

“I suppose such a thing is possible,” the harvester finally said.  Its words were reluctant.  “There are forces more powerful than us on this campground.”

“It was the ice,” I said quickly.

I’m more than happy to throw those two forces into opposition.  Let the ice and the harvesters battle it out.  I’ll sit on the sidelines and sip tea with Beau.  But my hope was short-lived, as the harvester didn’t seem terribly bothered by my words.  It only slipped the knife into the large pocket of its raincoat.

“We will repair it,” the harvester said dismissively, “if you bring us the material.”

“Can I… keep it until then?  It’s still usable.”

The hands holding my arms tightened.  Clearly that was the wrong thing to say.

“Sorry, sorry!” I hastily amended.  “I didn’t mean to give offense.”

“Bring us a new hilt.  You’ll know what it is when you find it.”

And they let go.  I let out a shaky sigh of relief and rubbed at my arms.  There were red imprints on my flesh from where they’d held me fast.  I grimaced.  If they left bruises I was going to be pissed.

“How did you pull me back?” I asked them, before they could turn to leave.

“Pull you back?”

It sounded confused.  I tried to explain.  I was… elsewhere, I think.  I’d followed the voice out in the woods and then I wasn’t here anymore.  It felt like I was unraveling.

“We found you standing here,” it said.  “There was nothing else.”

I didn’t know what else to ask.  So they left, and took with them my knife.

I’m a campground manager.  I wonder if this was what it was like for all the prior generations that managed the land before me.  I’ve always thought that I understood this land and the inhabitants on it, but now I’ve encountered something that I am wholly unfamiliar with.  Did I take false confidence in my library and my file cabinets full of notes?

This land holds mysteries still.  Something that even the harvesters weren’t aware of had pulled me away.  And at first I thought it had clawed my mind away from my body, dragging it into another place - perhaps the gray world, perhaps adjacent - but I *hurt*.  Like I’ve ran too far or lifted weights for too long.  My muscles are exhausted.  I’ve been sucking down Advil just to function.

If the harvesters hadn’t grabbed me, I would have been pulled apart.

I think I need to avoid that thing until I know more.  It’s infuriating.  I’m outclassed by everything on this campground.

There is one thing I can do to remedy that, however.  I’m going to get the harvesters the parts they need to fix my knife. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds)

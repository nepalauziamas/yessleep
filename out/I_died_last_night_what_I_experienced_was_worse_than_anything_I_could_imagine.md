When I got into my bathtub last night, razor blade in hand, I expected a certain outcome.

What I got was something so terrifying, I could never have prepared for it.

It felt like shutting off an old CRT television. In one moment there was static, a burning pain that quickly fed into the whitenoise, and the next…nothingness. The media really had me believing I would see a bright light when I died, but the feeling of absolute emptiness was something you cannot fathom until you’re existing within it.

It’s like I was alive, but I didn’t exist anywhere…I don’t know how else to explain it. I knew I wasn’t in my body anymore, but where I was made no sense. I could literally *feel* the nothingness that consumed every inch of the place I was in. There was this immense, warm pressure all over me and within me, like I was being compacted into a single space.

I don’t know how long this lasted, nor do I have any way of truly telling how long I was there before everything began to change.

The nothingness started to fill up with sound. It sounded like a loud billowing wind tunnel, like I was behind a plane. It was loud, so loud that I began to feel like I was going to go deaf, if I even had ears where I was.

And then there was the pop, and I was…somewhere.

It looked like a hotel hallway, like the hotel I was in that night, but something to it was just…off? It’s like the walls were different sizes on both sides, and the length seemed so short, yet so infinitely long all at once. The doors all looked like different sizes, widths, colours. It was like it was so close to normal, but somehow not even close to what it should look like. 

Then the footsteps began. They were slow at first, and I couldn’t tell where they were coming from, but they sounded close. 

Closer.

Closer.

Closer.

They began to run.

So I did too. 

I ran through the hallway as the footsteps broke into a sprint and were partnered now with this hellacious, guttural scream of something I could not see. It was something just out of the corner of my eye, always just out of view but so close to me I could feel its warm breath on the back of my neck as I ran. I took turn after turn after turn, not realising until later that it made no sense how many turns were in this hallway. They weren’t intersecting each other, nor were they overlapping, yet somehow, they were continuous left turns. 

Only left turns.

I ran until my legs gave out, and the thing that was chasing me was now above me as I lay on the ground, huddled in the fetal position. I could feel its claws scratching at my back. It’s teeth tearing into me. I felt my body get torn to pieces and I felt every ounce of it as I was consumed by a creature I never had the chance to see.

Nothingness. Again. Eternal pressure building within my very being.

I awoke a second time, but this time I was in a room I couldn’t determine. Thinking back on it now, the room was so basic yet so…indescribable all together. Nothing about the room made sense…no…it didn’t make *enough* sense.

There was someone in the room with me. I could make out no face on them, nor any defining features, yet as I looked upon them I felt pain and agony and so much overwhelming sorrow.

I tried to beg and plead and ask them to forgive me, but I could not speak, I couldn’t utter a single word.

The figure held up one hand to its face, as if it were telling me to be quiet, and my attempted plea ceased, and I stood there motionless before them. It approached me and placed it’s hand on my cheek, caressing me softly. And it was at this moment I knew who they were. I saw their beginning, beside something so powerful, so magnificently beautiful, I could never find the words to describe it. The figure before me spoke into my thoughts, in a language I could not decipher, yet somehow understood.

*This is the Sleeping Child.* Was what it said to me.

*I was its first. I was its favourite creation. It cherished me above all else, until it determined me flawed. It banished me here. Where it banishes those it deems flawed. I look over all who come here, and I hurt them. This is my realm.* 

The creature showed me so many other people who ended up here, a countless number of people who wound up in this place. So many people who came face to face with it, who were shown the truth. 

It’s hand on my face grew warn, and coarse. And as I looked upon it, I saw death, and hatred, and famine, and agony. I saw children dying, I saw families burning alive. I saw chemicals burning helpless villagers' skin. I saw bombs dropping in the dead of night. I heard the cries and screams of those who never had a chance. I felt their pain all at once. My bones began to break and repair and break again. My flesh burned and rendered. I felt my skin peel back and acid pour upon the open wounds. I begged for forgiveness and I pleaded for an eternity to the thing that was called the Sleeping Child. I begged for one more chance. I screamed as loud as I could, joining the symphonic sounds of those it deemed flawed. 

And then I awoke.

It was this morning when my eyes opened in the hospital room. Apparently the doctors were able to resuscitate me after I was gone for over thirty minutes. They told me it was a miracle that they were able to bring me back. 

But I don’t know if I truly am.

Even as I sit here, recollecting my memories of that place, as more moments come into my mind, I keep seeing that figure. They’re just behind my peripheral, no matter where I am, their hand reaching for me, trying to bring me back.

I swear, even as the nurse was checking my vitals, I noticed her features begin to melt and lose detail.

All I can say is if you’re thinking of ending it early, don’t. Don’t even *think* like that. What comes next is worse than anything you can dream of.

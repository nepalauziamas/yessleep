If you're reading this message, it means that my plan to send this from your future into the past was a success. Yes, you read that right, this is a message from the future.

To start off, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Lance Parker, and I'm currently a researcher, an engineer, and an officer, stationed at a headquarters on Neptune. I was born on Mars in September 7, 2061. It is the year 2094 now, of March 16, so you're probably considering that we've existed this long into the future. However, I'm about to tell you that this message is not of hope, but of doom. Doom from the impending destruction that will await us in the next few hours, and this is all thanks to the foolishness of our space-faring enemies, who did not want to share the vast cosmos with their intergalactic neighbors. But I'm assuming this is also our fault, because it was from us that they learned to develop my greatest and most prized invention, the technology to create 'wormholes' to travel space, rather than rely on the use of wormholes currently sitting out there in the cosmos. Unfortunately, their technology had gone horribly wrong, and had brought about their demise as well as ours. We always considered them to be a formidable yet somewhat foolish enemy, but the one thing we didn't expect out of them was an act of desperation which lead to the existence of an even more terrifying enemy, one that neither of us have the technology or military might to resist.

This all started, back in 2044. Our species began to develop technology which allowed us to travel out into space, making your time's technology look like child's play. Even better was the choice of us not fighting amongst ourselves anymore, since we all learned the hard way about war and death on our own home world, that being Earth. We also started developing the technology to terraform planets in our solar system. Of course, I wasn't born at the time, but our historical records gave us information of everything that happened in the past few decades. We always thought that we might actually be alone, until we came across other species. Some were friendly to us, and offered us assistance in the long run to develop. Others on the other hand, like the enemies we were facing, weren't so intent on helping us, as they believed to be the true inhabitants and rulers of the galaxy. This ultimately lead to war, and we did not have the technology to combat them at the time. But thanks to other species who helped us develop our technology to greater heights, and who also share a common enemy, we were able to fight them off for the time being. This war however, lasted for many years, even to this day. They are not an easy enemy to pick with, that's for sure. In the Kardashev point of view, they were at what I'm assuming to be a Type III level, but we were catching up to them. In the logical point of view, this wouldn't make sense to you, as we were supposed to reach that level within another few million years, maybe more or less. But thanks to the help of some of our space-faring friends, as well as the technology we took from the captured ships belonging to our enemies, developing the technology of a 'Type III' was quicker than calculated.

Sadly, as I said, this war lasted for many years. Casualties started climbing not only on their end, but on ours as well, and we needed to do something to help us turn the tide of the war. This was where, one of my most prized creations came in. While stationed on Neptune, back in 2082, I began working on new technology I specifically called 'Parker-WHM' or 'Parker-Worm-Hole-Maker.' Of course, I didn't want to take all the credit, even though it was my blueprint that lead to this. If it weren't for my helpful and highly-respected associates assisting in the design, this wouldn't have been possible. But at the same time, I'm guessing it was better to risk casualties until there's an eventual winner, instead of risking the now-oncoming death and destruction falling upon our entire galaxy, and perhaps, even this entire universe. Nevertheless, I congratulated them for assisting me in the creation of this new technology. It was specifically designed as I named it, to be a wormhole maker. I'm not gonna go in too much details on how it works, for two reasons:

1. It's probably best that this technology is not made in your time, as this will save you enough time on your skin and bones to remain existent until our inevitable future in which I sent this message to you.
2. I don't have the time to send you the details, since it would take over two hours, and 'they' are fast approaching. So by the time you receive this message, I'll most likely be long dead by now.

To make a long story short, it was a device that started off as a prototype, but after generating a few tests and being pleased with the results my invention had brought us, this changed the course of the war. While it took a few months, we were able to apply similar technology to smaller ships and even small fighters and scout ships to travel to different areas of the universe in an instant. Even though our enemies' ships could travel much faster than ours, the wormholes gave us the upper hand upon reaching certain places. Thus began the colonization race between us and our enemies, and we were winning. Our battleships were also catching them by surprise thanks to this technology, allowing us to appear to them without being detected of our arrival in that very instant. So if our forces ever needed reinforcements right away, say no more. Unfortunately for them, their reinforcements arrive too late, as their forces calling for help have already been decimated in the battle.

Given the current status of the war, and the revolution that our new technology had brought us, we were congratulated by our fellow humans, along with those from other star systems. A massive party was held in congratulations to our victory. That was a night I'll forever remember, and a night that I'll cherish the most, since I've never been given much gratitude and congratulatory honors for my own bravery, having once fought on the front lines against our enemies. Sadly, these celebrations do not last, since we were still at war with those beings. To make things even worse, this is where everything turns sour. One of our ships containing this invention, was destroyed in battle, and the enemy did the same thing we did that lead us to catching up to them, eventually surpassing them. Even though the remnants of the designs to the technology was damaged, they took the ship and decided to use that technology against us this time. Our forces at the time were overwhelmed because those bastards caught us off-guard. So we couldn't stop them in time. Not to mention the tracking system on that ship was also destroyed, and we had no information on where they would end up. Keep in mind, these guys were around long enough to know this galaxy much more than us, even though the war was in our favor. Their knowledge of the galaxy and perhaps the universe, still dwarfed ours.

Since that event, we haven't heard from the enemy in a while. Even though there were skirmishes, they were much smaller than before. It was as if, they're trying to work on something to help them in their war efforts as a means to defeat us. Months and months of waiting even with all smaller skirmishes, our enemies became more active once again. To my horror, they managed to create wormholes of their own, only, not quite.

Instead of wormholes, they twisted my invention to create something even more powerful. They used my invention to create portals, which allows them to travel not throughout the universe in an instant, but into other universes, or even dimensions. Given these circumstances, this would be bad news for us. Who knows what the enemy will be capable of, when they make more of this technology of mine they twisted for their own benefit? I would be upset about this, but I suppose we weren't so different considering we did the same with their technology to help us win the war. Still, the ability to travel to other universes was still a terrifying aspect, because they were after all, our enemies. The only thing we had on our side was the fact they didn't expand this technology into other ships, but the one they were using that we encountered. As expected, our orders were clear: Destroy that ship and retake the technology.

If we're successful, then perhaps we could learn how to use portals now instead of just wormholes. So once again, we are still continuing with this war until one of us eventually wins. It was at this moment that everything went from sour, to grim.

When we encountered their portal-creating ship, they were prepared to use it upon us to travel into another universe. At the moment we were winning the battle, our enemies demonstrated their new technology to create a portal, to escape from certain defeat. From the cockpit window, we could see inside the portal what they created, but could not make out exactly what was inside of it. Thanks to our ship's ability to use a mounted screen and a camera-scope outside of our ship that shows us a much more closer, clear view of what's in, we were met with a strange discovery. It seems that our enemies had opened a portal into a realm, perhaps another universe, that defied all logic and what we thought the universe would be like. In that portal, we were able to see what our enemies were seeing. In that portal, there appeared to be massive, dome-shaped structures that appeared to be floating in what seems to be empty space in the background. The buildings also emitted a strange, purple aura around it.

Upon further observation, we watched our enemies slowly enter the portal. For a few moments, there was nothing happening. We initially thought that it was just an abandoned space, until something finally occurred. Viewing our screen, we could see smaller ships, which we assume to be fighters belonging to that universe, head towards the enemy ship. Our enemies did something that made them regret their actions. The ship shot at one of the dome-shaped structures in that universe, but that blast did not leave a scratch on it, as if it had no effect. That's when one of the smaller fighters of that universe, emitted a powerful lightning bolt, which appeared to be directed at the attacking ship. Just one attack from that fighter, caused most of the enemy ship to be destroyed in an instant, followed by a second lightning-bolt like attack that destroyed the rest of it. This left us astonished and surprised at the power of these things. I would have been grateful, as our enemies have lost the very thing that would've won them the war. But to our horror and shock, the smaller ships exited through the portal, and turned their attention towards us after destroying what remained of our fleeing foes.

The smaller fighters attacked us next. We were extremely lucky to have our shields up at that moment, when one of the fighters shot at us, causing our ship to 'flip' in space, causing most of the crew inside who were standing, to fall instantly due to the impact. The shield was instantly gone, but it did save us from the likelihood of being destroyed completely. However, much of the ship where the attack had struck, had taken severe damage. Most of our ship's hull was severely damaged beyond repair, and about 150 of our crewmates that were present in that hull, died from that blast. Nevertheless, we were still able to get out. The other battleship that accompanied us was the most unfortunate or most unlucky. When the fighters attacked their ship, one of them emitted an orb-like energy which flew straight toward that ship, and engulfed it. This caused the battleship to lose all power in a matter of seconds, rendering them defenseless and incapable of battle. Just at that very instant, the ship was hit with one lightning-bolt attack from the fighter, and was immediately destroyed. We escaped thanks to our wormhole technology, just before our new enemies could target us with those terrifying weapons they possess. However, after a few days have passed, one of our scouts gave us news that made me frown with sadness and dread:

"They're purging the galaxy."

Try as we might, none of our battle-ready ships were capable of stopping them. Our enemies were the first to be targeted by this unknown, more terrifying foe. They were the ones who opened a portal into their universe and intruded in their space, and even going so far as to attack them. We've sent some of our messengers or ambassadors to try and reason with them, only to no avail as they were not willing to chit-chat or communicate for peaceful terms between our two forces. Upon the multitude of questions asking why they're doing this, they finally sent a message to one of our ambassadors in binary code, and we could translate it. It said the following:

THAT LAST ATTACK FROM YOUR UNIVERSE WAS THE FINAL STRAW. PREPARE TO BE DESTROYED FOR YOUR ACTIONS.

That was it, they said nothing after that, and resumed their onslaught. To my understanding, it seems our previous enemies kept attacking their universe, trying to claim it for themselves, but to no avail. The one question that plagued my mind upon understanding this is, why? Why did they continue in their hopeless efforts to keep attacking this universe, knowing they were completely unsuccessful? Is it all done on purpose? Did they know they would lose the war eventually, so they decided to anger an even more dangerous, more powerful enemy, thinking that if they can't rule the galaxy, then neither can we? So many more questions flooded my mind, trying to understand the situation. I suppose on the other hand, it's pointless to bother asking, knowing I'll die soon. Even though we were innocent, and we hadn't done anything wrong to them, this didn't matter in the end. Perhaps we would become a threat to them too, someday, had they left us alone, even though it's a foolish thing to think of.

So I'm sending this message to you, the one reading this. I guess you could say that if we don't build the wormhole tech, the chances are, this won't happen, right? However, keep in mind. I wasn't born at the time, so I wouldn't know about this event, nor remember it by the time I'm gone. Nor would your scientists ever believe this message to be true, and continue carrying on with their designs for making space-faring technology that can prove helpful to us, but also very fatal if in the wrong hands. I guess you can also say that there is no point in telling anyone this, let alone any of you, since no one would believe you. But against my better judgment, the world needs to know about this.

So I'm telling you this right now...

Make the most of your life. Live life freely while you can. Because when 2094 arrives, this will be the end of our existence.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

They just didn't listen to me. None of them did. Fuck them.

When I was in high school back in 2010, I was met with a chilling discovery on my laptop. I received a message that was said to be from someone named 'Lance Parker' and claimed he was from the future. According to him, it was the year 2094, where we would meet our demise. I would assume that this is some sort of prank, made by a random person, trying to mess with me. But strangely, I couldn't even detect the source or origin of the file. Despite being knowledgeable on how to 'hack' into computers and also track sources and origins of files, let alone locations of people around the world, I could not find an origin of that message. It was as if it came out of nowhere.

I apologize for my rudeness, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Dayne Owens, and I'm one of the tech engineers at NASA. By now, I had just told you about my discovery of the message and what the contents were.

Why am I telling you this? Well, you see, we're right now in the year of 2022, and we are creating yet more groundbreaking, space-faring technology as we speak, although most of our projects are kept top-secret from the public, so not much of the technology was released yet, but kept classified until they were ready for use. This I didn't mind of course, our top-secret projects still needed work. But just as when I was walking to the breakroom to make a cup of orange juice, I overheard my superiors. They discussed matters regarding the top-secret technology. What caught my attention was the year they said they were going to release this new technology and continue its further development:

2044.

According to the message, that was the year we started developing space-faring technology, and we encountered other beings in the cosmos, along with that of our enemies. Like I said earlier, they did not listen to me, not one of them. I'm referring to what I told them about the Parker-WHM project. I assumed that it would probably be best not to build such a thing, and we ensure rules that none of our technology should be made to create wormholes, even if it means we might lose the future war. This would at least guarantee a future for the galaxy and our future allies, perhaps even ourselves if we become the victors. I became shocked and horrified to overhear this:

"I think we should work on the wormhole technology, earlier than expected. It would give us the upper hand before our enemies would encounter us."

One of my superiors said this. I didn't know who it was, nor will I give names. I think it would be very unwise to go after the person coming up with this idea. Nevertheless, it's horrifying to realize they're planning to make the Parker-WHM project happen sooner than what was told. I suppose in a way, the messenger was right. They wouldn't believe me, but I guess it depended on what they mean by not believing. Not believing the likelihood of unwittingly allowing our technology to end up in the wrong hands, only to bring about a possible end of the galaxy. Perhaps it would've been better if I had kept my mouth shut. Then again, I suppose no matter what I say or what I do, its never going to change. Even if I were to quit, considering that I play a significant role in the engineering of our technology, they would already find a replacement for my profession. Its clear to me that humanity also carries enormous idiots, probably myself included.

So now, here I am, working on one of our top-secret space crafts. Other than that, I guess I'm now just enjoying what life I have left. I should consider myself lucky I might be long dead before 2094. But it pains me to understand that our existence is about to be cut short in the next several decades. Right now, I can't help but worry. I'm worried, because of the idea of my superiors. I fear that once we start working the technology to create wormholes for our space crafts, it might bring about our imminent destruction, much sooner.

I don't know how to begin this other than to say I'm not Jill. Or the OP, as I guess it's called here. I'm just learning the etiquette. This is my first post. I'm Roberta. Jill's best friend. Jill gave me her password for this account and told me to tell the rest of her story if anything happened to her. I think maybe something has. I'm just not sure what.

Reading through her previous posts, I can see that she has told all of you pretty much the same story she told me just a few nights ago, right after David's suicide, if that's what it was.

We sat on her sofa, having a couple of glasses of wine, the View-Master she's been telling you all about sitting on the curio cabinet.

She was explaining how she'd thrown it out the window, then saw it sitting in the back seat.

“It was there the whole time,” I reasoned. “You thought you threw it out the window, but it must have bounced off the back window and into the back seat.”

“No, remember, I was looking in the back seat and it wasn't there.”

“But David was?” I asked incredulously. “Come on. It was dark. And were you really in your right mind?”

“I haven't been in my right mind in a while, I think,” she admitted, “I don't know what to do.”

“I do,” I said. “Have another glass of wine.”

At least that suggestion got a little bit of a smile out of her, so I poured us both another glass.

“David was gullible,” I continued. “And I know you don't want to hear it, but he was fragile. Must have had a mental breakdown. He was susceptible. Power of suggestion. “

That seemed to turn on a lightbulb in her head.

“Power of suggestion. Wait a minute...”

Then she started saying things that at first made no sense, although they all were connected.

“The roll of paper towels he used to mop of the spilled whiskey...they were Sparkle paper towels!”

“O-okay,” I answered, not getting it yet.

“His wife's name was Sparkle,” she said. “And I'm just remembering, on the coffee table, the *National Geographic* that was sitting there. It had a cover story about Egyptian artifacts.”

It was all coming together in Jill's head, and I was picking up on it too. She mentioned these off-hand in her account of the meeting at Frank's apartment.

“He was looking at a *National Geographic* magazine about cursed Egyptian artifacts. And they were selling rubies, on the Home Shopping Network. Damn, you're right. He Kaizer-Soze'd me!” Jill declared.

“What?” I asked, still a little behind her on deciphering the mystery.

“Like that character in the movie. He made the whole thing up on the spot. The magazine, the Sparkle paper towels, the Home Shopping Network...”

“Uuhh...okay?” I half-answered.

“Those were all things that were around the room. Sparkle paper towels, a magazine about ancient Egyptian curses...the Home Shopping Network was showing rubies. And he put them all in his story. He made it up on the spot, getting ideas from all the things sitting around him. Why would he do that? Maybe he was the murderer.”

“Or *maybe* he was a charlatan,” I answered, figuring that was way more likely. “You're going to have to face the facts. David killed himself. This Frank guy just did what they do when they're trying to pass off worthless crap as some kind of mystical artifacts. He's probably got tons of the things he sells for twenty bucks a pop.

“19.95. Plus tax,” she answered absently. Which seemed like a damn strange comment until I actually read the whole story in her posts.

Jill appeared to be having an epiphany on the spot.

“You're right,” she said. “It's like Occam's Razor. That which isn't completely fucking ridiculous should be believed over that which is. I feel really silly. More wine, please.”

“Now you're making sense,” I said. “We'll get some more wine, sit on the couch, and watch some TV.”

“Right,” she agreed. “Oh! I want to see what Doris found up Betsy's ass.”

?? 

Now that didn't make any sense. She then proceeded to explain a game show called *Cash Cow* to me. I wasn't familiar with it. Sounded pretty bizarre.

A few minutes later, we were still watching something else while sitting on Jill's couch. *Cash Cow* was still not on yet. We were having a relatively normal conversation, but Jill seemed a little distracted. She kept looking over at the View-Master. 

Eventually, she got up from the couch. I thought she was maybe walking into the kitchen.

“Hey, while you're up, why don't you get me some more of that Gouda cheese?” I asked, but never received an answer. 

That was when I think I saw something. Just for a second, but I'm pretty sure I saw something in the television. A red glow reflecting from the kitchen. 

“Hey, where's my cheese?” I asked.

No answer. 

An inordinate amount of time had gone by, so I got up to see where she was. I searched the kitchen, then looked to the living room, past where we had been sitting. The front door was open. I looked at the curio cabinet. The View-Master was no longer sitting on top of it. As I walked to the open doorway, I looked down. There it was. On the floor not two feet from the doorway. It wasn't glowing, by the way. 

The only explanation is that Jill had looked into it, saw...whatever it is you saw, then simply bailed out of life and walked out of her own home. She didn't kill herself as the others supposedly did. Or at least if she did, her body hasn't been found yet.

A neighbor claimed to have been outside on her porch and seen Jill that night. She said Jill had been walking zombie-like down the street, shoulders slumped. But here's the thing: I had only sat on the couch a couple of minutes before I had gotten up and started looking for her. Her car was still parked in her garage and she had taken no possessions as far as I could tell. If she had been walking slowly, in zombie-like fashion, I would have seen her, right?

So I guess that's the end of the story. Except, there's a bit of an epilogue. The police came to interview me about Jill's disappearance. At first I didn't understand what they were getting at, but gradually realization crept in. 

According to their CSI investigators or blood spatter people or whatever, David's injury was not indicative of a self-inflicted wound. It seemed more likely that someone else had held the blade. 

I tried to do a little Nancy Drew-ing of my own. I found Pumpkintown. Yes, there is a convenience store called Mibb's. But the kid that was working there didn't remember Jill and had never heard of any Frank Miller that lived there, although he had heard of a Frank Miller that had written the *Daredevil* comic book. He did confirm there was a man named Harold that pisses in the floor, though.

I continued to try to track down Frank. I even found the Dollar General and went down the Frontage Road. There were no apartments above the Chinese restaurant.

And also let me ask all of you: Have you ever heard of that *Cash Cow* show with some weird Christopher Walken type host and people sitting on cows? Because I never have. I've Googled it and found no evidence of it whatsoever.

The closest I could come was something called *Cash Cab*, but I don’t even think it comes on anymore. 

So I'm left with a mystery. David's stab wounds, my inability to corroborate any of Jill's story and that she apparently hallucinated a conversation with David's ghost, a peculiar man that didn't seem to exist, and a bizarre TV show would lead me to believe she had just gone crazy and murdered her husband then disappeared.

But...

There's that View-Master. Where did she get it if the rest of the story was fiction? And after examining it, the cops didn't even keep it. Strange. Wouldn't it be evidence? They just left it and I brought it home with me. I don't even know why. I think maybe because it is the one piece of the puzzle that still doesn't fit into the Jill hallucinated theory. Because remember? I saw that red glow reflected in the television screen. For just that brief moment. But I know beyond any doubt that I did.

And here it sits. On a bookshelf in my home, next to my *Star Trek* DVD's and my Chuck Palahniuk novels, the blank disc still inserted. It's really the only part of this I have left to examine. I know the rules, but we know the story really isn't true, now don't we? And I only have Jill's word that the reel is blank. I mean, it's a long shot but maybe if it's not, there might be a clue on it. 

It's not glowing now or anything. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to take a look.

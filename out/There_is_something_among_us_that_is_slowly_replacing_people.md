In the midst of lockdown, I had bought myself some solid gym equipment to continue working out at home. This came after hours of frustration of watching home workout videos on youtube. I missed the feeling of crunching out rep after rep at the gym and the closest I could get to it was establishing my own home gym. 

My flat is a bit on the small end so I could not place the equipment I bought anywhere inside my home. It was either switching my bed out for the bench press or putting it outside. Thankfully, right beside my house, I have a driveway with a roof over it. I would have to park my car on the street, but it was well worth being able to workout like normal. 

The gym equipment fit quite snuggly in the driveway and I absolutely loved the set up, however amidst working from home and meeting deadlines, I found I could only really work out at night under the dim orange driveway lights. And so, that’s how I formed my routine; I would regularly get out there at 8pm and workout until 9:30 before going straight to bed. 

With the new freedom of having access to a gym, a few steps away, I pushed my workout time to later and later, until I was working out at 11 when I should’ve been getting ready for bed. 

It was one of those late nights, when I finally realised the depth of my mistake. 

I was engrossed in a horror podcast I was listening to, when I suddenly had a really strong feeling that I was being watched. I’d gotten used to working out in the dim orange light, with a slight wind causing the leaves to rustle. The odd sounds no longer made me jump and I was truly comfortable with the night. 

But this time something was off. I immediately stopped my podcast and for the first time, felt exposed in the cool night air. I looked around and could see no one, but that primal feeling lingered, reminding me of danger. 

The street was dead silent. I have lived on that street for several years of my life yet that night, it looked strange. I could almost swear I saw long dark figures walking around everywhere but they only existed in my peripheral vision. As soon as I focused on them, they seemed to fade into the night. Maybe I was just paranoid and making things up out of the shadows like you’d do at night with random objects in your room, but that strong feeling of being watched remained. 

I continued to desperately search for the thing that was watching me but at the end, I chalked it up to an effect of listening to a horror podcast at night. 

I put my earbuds back in and tapped them to start playing the podcast again. 

*If you feel like there’s something watching you, there almost always is*

I paused the podcast. This was not part of the story I was listening to. I rewinded it and played it again. 

*The breathing was very heavy and shallow, like someone who had run a marathon. Whatever was making those sounds was standing completely still on the edge of the turn, just out of sight.*

I was going paranoid and starting to hear things as well. The podcast continued on as normal but I was still on edge. Beads of sweat rolled down the sides of my face and it wasn’t from physical exertion. 

I jumped when I heard my friend Andy’s voice right beside me

“Dude, Ethan you okay?”, he piped up

I stared at him in shock, confused as to how he had suddenly appeared in front of me. My mind was starting to break down and I was starting to question what I was seeing. I needed help, medical help. I started to think back to what could’ve possibly caused me to hallucinate like this. 

Did I accidentally hit my head?

Andy waved his hand in front of my face and laughed. His expression then quickly shifted to a concerned look, when I didn’t start laughing along with him. 

“Mate, you good?”, He asked. His presence caused knots to form in my stomach

“Yes, where did you come from?” I asked, still trying to rationalise the situation. The feeling of being watched was gone but had been replaced by a sense of strong apprehension. I was sweating buckets now and starting to consider running inside and calling myself an ambulance. There was definitely something wrong. But was it with me? Or was something really bad about to happen. 

“I just walked up to you, but you seemed to be sitting there completely still and unaware”, He said.

It started to make sense. I was too absorbed in my own fear and thoughts to notice him walking up to me. I was even about to invite him inside but I stopped as the one lingering question in my mind expressed itself more strongly. 

“Andy, what are you doing here in the middle of the night?”, I asked with a wavering voice. 

Andy looked at me, his face half shadowed. Something was off about him, Andy wasn’t usually like this. I pulled out my phone and dialled 911 before putting it back in my pocket. Andy didn’t seem to react, he continued to look at me with an unreadable expression before answering. 

“Just wanted to check up on you, why are you acting so wEIRd Ethan”, he said. He mispronounced the word weird by emphasising the middle sounds a bit too much. It was as if he was a computer and he had glitched. I looked over at his hand and noticed that the scar on his ring finger was gone. He had gotten it from an insect bite when we went camping as teenagers. 

“Andy what happened to the scar on your finger?”, I asked now with barely any courage to speak. 

He looked over at his hand and smiled. It was at that moment that I realised his face seemed off too. This wasn’t Andy, it was someone trying to impersonate him. Andy wouldn’t act like that, he would not visit in the middle of the night and most importantly he always had a scar on his finger. 

“I NeVEr HaD ONe, CALm DOwN ETHAN”, He spoke with, his voice distorting all over the place like his vocal chords were being pulled. He reached out his hand towards me while his face distorted into a demented grin that extended from ear to ear. 

It all happened in slow motion. Had I been in the right mind at the time, I properly would’ve reacted less violently but my degrading psyche and will to survive played into my actions. 

I quickly picked up a metal weight that was laying right next to me and hit Andy smack in the face as hard as I could. 

He flew back, his face now deformed and pushed in. Thick yellow liquid oozed out of his orifices instead of blood and he emitted a loud screech. 

The screech physically hurt my head and nearly ruptured my eardrums. All the while Andy kept staring at me until we both heard sirens in the distance. He smiled at me before the yellow liquid that had been oozing out of him suddenly turned a darker redder colour. He closed his eyes and lay down on the floor as the police stopped in front of my house

The rest was a blur

They think I’m crazy, that I had had an isolation induced psychosis episode. They are thinking of diagnosing me with capgras delusion but they are blind. They don’t see it. 

There’s something among us that’s replacing us. 

One day it could be your friend, parent, child or spouse but they are working their way through us

\*\*\*\*\*

The above letter was written by the man that was recently sent to this mental health ward. He keeps on saying that his friend, who visited him, was an impostor. He nearly killed his friend in a violent outlash and we are certain he’s experiencing psychosis. 

However today I saw Andy when driving home, he showed no signs of the horrible injury he had suffered last night.

There is something among us that is slowly replacing us

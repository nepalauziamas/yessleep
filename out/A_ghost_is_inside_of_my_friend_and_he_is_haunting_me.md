A ghost is inside of my friend and he is haunting me

My friend Bill had the brilliant idea to go camping last week, and it ended up going horribly wrong.

I had gotten ready to go camping and picked Bob up. I had a bad felling in my stomach about it, I’ve always hated camping, it always felt odd to me. We got to the campsite and it had started raining. We trudged along the muddy, slippery path to where we decided to put our tent. We had misjudged how fast we’d get there so it was already getting dark. By the time our camp was set up it was pretty late maybe 8PM. We ate some s’mores then Billy asked me to go exploring with me. 


“I don’t think it’s a good idea!” I said.

“Cmon it will be fun.” Bob said.

“Ok fine you convinced me.” I exclaimed.

We walked down the path and something was off it felt weird and there was a chill down my spine. While we were walking we saw this mutilated bear. It didn’t look like any animal I know could’ve done it.

“Wow what do you think did this?” Bobby commented.

“I don’t know let’s leave bro I’m kinda scared.” I told him.

“Shut the bitch up you pussy fuck.” Bill said back, meanly.

All of a sudden some white spirit came down. I was freaking out. It starting spinning around Bob in the air. 

“Wait, what is tha-!” Bob started. 

Before Bob could finish his sentence, the spirit came inside of him. It looked like he was fighting to keep the spirit out of him, but it was a fight he’d eventually lose. The ghost came inside of him. Billy Bob started shaking and scratching himself. His head and neck started to twist from side to side. His eyes went white and blood shot. After he was done jittering around, the ghost (my friends?) eyes landed on me. 

“Start running.” It said.

I ran super fast back the start of the trail, leaving all of my stuff at the campsite. I noticed that after I got past the campsite, the monster stopped, perhaps it was smelling my stuff to get my scent or something. I got to the car and put the key in the ignition. In my rear view mirror, I saw my friend. He started running to me on all fours so I stepped on the gas. I ended up running over a bunnny rabbit, and I saw the ghost eating it in the rear view mirror. I shuddered to myself. I can’t believe I made it out of there alive. I thought to myself. I wonder what the freak happened.

Even after a week since the attack, I’m still shaken up. I tried to tell my aunt about it but she laughed at me so I never told anyone else. Also, I started noticing weird things. Stuff in my house would be moved around just enough so that I’d notice. Also, I started seeing stuff out of the corner of my eye. 

Shit really hit the fan tonight, though. I was working at my office and I heard branches moving outside. I looked out the window and then all of a sudden a dirty hand slapped against the window. It’s long nails scraping all the way down until it rested at the side of what was once my friend Bob. He (it?) looked half starved. And he was dirty, in ripped rags. He had blood and cuts all over. He started clawing the window again. I pointed my phone flash light at him and he hissed and ran away in terror. As he was running, he said “I’ve already came inside of your friend, and I’ll come inside of you soon enough. You’re the one I want, the one I need.” 

Reddit, I’m shaking right now. What should I do? Who can I tell? I really don’t want the monster to come inside of me! I know he doesn’t like light, maybe I can use that against him…

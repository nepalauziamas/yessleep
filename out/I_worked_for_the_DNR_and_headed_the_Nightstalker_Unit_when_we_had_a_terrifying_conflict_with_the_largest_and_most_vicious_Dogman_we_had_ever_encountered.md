Since responses to my last post were so overwhelmingly positive, I decided this might be a good place to tell my stories. We don't get much recognition for our work, it being so classified, so any praise or acknowledgement from people, even if it is under the guise of fiction writing, is more than welcome. I have since retired from the business and any record of me with the DNR would have been removed or sealed so there would be no way to verify anything I tell you, which is why I feel I can be completely honest with you about the things we in the Nightstalker Unit have accomplished over the years. We don't require your praise to do what we do, but we sure do appreciate it.

That being said, one of the questions I've received from you all about the contact ritual I wrote about before is whether I knew of or had a contact ritual go wrong or turn out badly. It has been known to happen. The best case scenario in the event of a failure is that they simply don't show up for the meeting. There have been times when we were blocked on the path to the meeting place and were menaced until we left the area. 

Others had been injured during the contact, whether that was because of something they did wrong or because that particular pack decided they wanted us out of there was hard to say. Either way, all contact would be suspended afterward until further notice. The most interesting case of an unsuccessful contact that I witnessed was during a rather infamous situation in the Ottowa National forest over by Lake Superior. This all happened in the early 90's and was the closest we'd come to a full on war with a pack of Dogmen. It was also infamous because it was when we first met the man we call the Dog Catcher. 

Jericho "The Dog Catcher" Jackson is quite possibly the greatest cryptid hunter who ever was or ever will be. He has saved our bacon more times than I can count. If a situation gets bad and lives are at stake, we call Jericho. He is the most unkillable man I've ever met.

The reason we had attempted the contact ritual with a nearby pack was there had been a string of sightings around the National Park, enough that it indicated whatever pack was in the area was not shy around people which was problem enough for us. But it was the disappearances of hunters, hikers, and even forest rangers in the area that concerned us most. We had contained the area and closed the park to the public but that would only work for so long. Dogmen are nomadic creatures for the most part. The witness reports were also very disturbing. 

They described a Dogman that was estimated to be over 10 feet tall and had only one eye and a bald patch on the right side of the head that looked to be burn scars. If this was the Dogman causing the problems, we might be dealing with a rogue alpha. After we had managed to collect evidence of the Dogman in question, we attempted the ritual of contact at a nearby forest where there was a meeting place. I personally conducted the ritual and it was the only one I had been unsuccessful at. 

It went well, right up until I presented the evidence to the Alpha. It sniffed at the samples and recoiled. I could have sworn for a moment I saw fear in its eyes before it turned on me and began growling. The others followed suit and I backed slowly away, more scared than I'd ever been in my life. They paced me all the way back to my camp and watched until I had packed up and left. This was unprecedented. Whoever this rogue alpha was, it had gained a fearful reputation among its own kind, something which was not an easy thing to do among Dogmen.

Our options from there were limited. We could keep people out of the area but we couldn't be everywhere. There would inevitably be some foolish campers or unscrupulous hunters who would ignore the signs and slip by our patrols. We couldn't just fence off the whole area, this was hundreds of miles of hard terrain. We needed to send in a strike team. We had teams trained and ready for situations like this and these boys were the best of the best. Fully informed on tracking, hunting and killing various cryptids. We sent them in and they stayed in contact with us for the first few days before going silent. We could hear gunshots in the distance but they soon stopped and we never saw those boys again.  
The strike team had never failed to bring down a dogman before now and we were running out of our very limited options. I think we were getting to the point where we were considering calling in the national guard and doing a full sweep and kill of the entire area when one of the units spotted something. There was a pillar of smoke deep in the forest, too big to be a campfire. The last thing we needed right then was a forest fire, though that would solve our problem in a costly way. They also reported hearing several explosions from the same direction and the decision was made to send out a team by helicopter to assess the situation. They came back with Jericho Jackson, looking like he'd been chewed up and spit out.  
The report they gave was incredible. The source of the fire turned out to be an ancient crumbling shack, long forgotten in the deep woods. All around the shack were smoking craters, improvised booby traps, and trip wires. They said it looked like a scene out of an old Vietnam war zone. They recovered the bodies of two juvenile dogmen, both male, and burned almost to ashes. They followed a trail of blood and drag marks to the body of the largest dogman we have on record. It could only be the rogue alpha we were looking for. 

It was barely recognizable, most of its fur had burned off and its skin was cracked and oozing blood. Both of its hind legs were hanging by the skin and the bone jutted out at the top of the break like broken teeth, almost like it had been walking on them. The left hand was gone along with most of the front teeth. The lower jaw was just ragged pieces and the mouth and throat was a bleeding black mess.   
They followed a blood trail further into the woods and almost opened fire when they spotted a dogman standing over what they thought was a body. They thought maybe it was protecting a recent kill until they backed off enough for it to relax. They said it sat on its haunches and licked the man's face until he stirred and they could see he was alive. They debated on if they should kill it or drive it off but they agreed the creature was only protecting the man and not attempting to harm him. 

One of them drew the short straw and approached slowly with a med kit. The dogman gave a short warning growl and backed away, watching them closely. They radioed it to us and we had a medical chopper there in 5 minutes. I myself got to actually examine the scene and let me tell you, it was terrifying how brutal and effective this man had been with improvised traps and weaponry. For a single person to kill not just one, but three dogmen, one of them being the biggest and meanest on record, was nothing short of miraculous. I desperately needed to talk with this man.  
The interview itself is in our records and I'll try to find a copy to transcribe here for you. I think I'll have to pull some strings to get to it but rest assured, his story is one that needs to be told. I'll update when I have it ready.

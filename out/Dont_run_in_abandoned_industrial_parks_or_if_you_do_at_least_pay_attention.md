I’ve always found it easier to run at night. There are less distractions, less cars, and, overall, everything seems to be more peaceful. 

Unfortunately, after what happened last week, I might have to give it up.

There’s a half-finished industrial park near my house that has been my go-to running spot for a while now. One lap around it’s dark quite loop is almost one mile. Every Monday night I run 12 laps, or basically 10 miles.

There are a few streetlights, but they’re spaced far enough apart that there are long stretches with no light at all. In the back corner of the industrial park is one of these stretches. About a year ago, someone started grading back there, for what I presume to be a giant warehouse, but they never finished it. It was almost like they disappeared overnight. There’s still equipment sitting out there to this day, dormant and rusting.  
   
 

Last Monday night I was on lap number 9 and approaching the back corner of the industrial park, when I found myself in a very familiar battle. This is usually the point in my runs where I’m mentally berating myself for thinking about quitting and going home, because of this psychological wrestling match I wasn’t paying much attention to my surroundings.

I ran right up to the construction entrance of the vacant lot when movement finally caught my eyes. I’m sure almost everyone is familiar with the feeling of suddenly noticing something moving in the darkness. You can literally feel the fight or flight response engage but there’s usually a moment of hesitation where you try to assess the situation before doing something embarrassing, at least that’s what I do.

I squared my body up in the direction of the movement and gave my eyes a second to adjust. Something was going back and forth like a windshield wiper stuck in the on position. 

It was an arm… waving at me. A man was standing about 50 feet off the road and waving at me like a demented wind-up doll. 

“Hello, can I help you?” I said in my best this isn’t freaking me the hell out voice.

No response… just more waving.

I’ve seen my fair share of horror movies so I knew that the time to run away was right then and there, but of course it can never be that simple. 

An audible switch could be heard as the streetlights started to die, one by one, moving in my direction. I took off towards the last one but about halfway there its current died too. I spun around in a frantic stupor trying to see something, but the sky was thick with clouds that night and the moon was no where to be found. 

Footsteps began thudding on the asphalt behind me. They were falling in a rhythmic pattern, 2 quick steps, then a breath, then 2 more. This psychopath was skipping towards me.

The mental battle I was previously having about finishing my run was over with. I sprinted all the way back to my house and never even turned to look over my shoulder. I tripped a few times in the darkness but the adrenaline kept me from feeling much pain.

Since that night I’ve done a lot of research about the vacant lot. Apparently, the contractor that started the development lost his ass, and apparently his mind too. He cracked under the pressure of mounting debt and disappeared. 

I’ve decided to do some investigating on site. I’ll update if anything comes of it.

I have had my fair share of creepy encounters when I have been laying in bed, ranging from sleep paralysis to night terrors, but I just wanted to focus on this one little thing today; something that has had an effect on the way I have slept for the past 20 or so years...

So ever since I was a kid I have had no option but to sleep with both of my feet tucked under the covers, I can't remember exactly when this started but I know exactly what happens if I forget to do this, even just one time. It isn't even a night time thing either. Day or night it seems to happen without fail.

I haven't done this for maybe about 10 years now and don't plan on doing so ever again, but whenever I leave my feet under the covers untucked, after a certain amount of time lying there I will feel a cold hand grab my feet...

And this isn't just a one time thing that has ultimately formed this night time habit, this happened every time I forgot to tuck my feet under the covers.

I remember one time when I was a teenager, I decided to be brave and I told myself that these habits are unhealthy, so I decided to just go to sleep without tucking my feet under the covers. It must have been a year or two since I had done this so I was thinking it was probably not going to happen since I was older and was no longer scared of monsters in the dark and that kind of stuff. Anyway, after a few minutes of lying there I began to feel the cold hand grab one of my feet and start to pull me down. Now I know this isn't sleep paralysis causing this because it happens when I am fully awake and barely even drifting off and it always ends the same, I jump out from underneath the covers usually shouting something along the lines of "what the f**k". 

I don't usually jump to conclusions about the paranormal with things like this because I know that the brain is a pretty complex thing, but it would make life a bit easier if I could just put this down to sleep paralysis or hypnogogic hallucinations. The problem is that I have felt this thing (whatever the hell it is) grab my feet every single time I have tried to go to sleep without the covers tucked underneath my feet, and almost every time I have barely been drifting to sleep and have had complete control of my body after it happens.

There was one time though when I was 19, I must have untucked my feet in my sleep and I woke up in sleep paralysis and the same thing happened; only this time I couldn't move. Because I couldn't move I got to experience what I had always feared would happen if I didn't jump out of bed. Two hands grabbed both of my feet and began to drag me down under the covers, but I didn't get dragged out of the bed, I just kept being pulled into this never ending void of bedsheets.

Anyway, I woke up from that one screaming in the dark and can't really remember anything that happened afterwards. I was living alone at that point in my life so a lot of my nights are filled with blank spots because of the amount of scary encounters I would have. I can't really say for sure if this was related to the usual hand grabbing my feet or if it was just a sleep paralysis episode triggered by my fears, but now I am 28 and I still go to bed (day or night) with my feet tucked under the covers. I have never had another sleep paralysis where this happened, it was just this once and every other time I was either awake or trying to go to sleep.

I remember talking to a friend about my feet tucking habit a while back and they said that they did the same, at first I was quite relieved thinking that this was maybe something normal triggered by trauma, but when I explained about the hands actually grabbing my feet, they were freaked out because they had never actually felt anything grab their feet. 

I'd like to put this down to something psychological as I have had a lot of trauma growing up so it would make sense, but either way it would be interesting to know if this has ever happened to anyone else, as from what I have heard from other people, the feet tucking thing is simply just a superstitious fear, where as my fear only started because of that thing grabbing my feet and trying to pull me under the covers.

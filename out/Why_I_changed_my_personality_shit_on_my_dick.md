Now, I'm just a sad old man - wasting away without purpose.  I spend my time at the bar, shooting pool one handed - so people know to stay clear of me - and most do; the rest eventually do, as well - after a bit of interaction.  

My first girlfriend had two of my abortions, in high school - although I think one of them was from this underclassmen guy, while I was in Germany for a few weeks.  I'm sure she's fine now - last I heard, she was married with kids, but she's a slut, anyway.  She can cum like a public water fountain.  I should have just kept that one.  

My childhood friend died on a motorcycle.  When I was a kid, I told my parents that he touched me inappropriately, which was a lie - still not sure why I did that; in my defense, I have social issues.  I never got to apologize for that.  

My last girlfriend, might be dead.  I made her get into prostitution, while I played video games.  I also sucked a bit of dick, which probably encouraged her further.   She got really depressed and did seventy hits of acid one night; they were all tossed into a drink, and she always had to be the most hardcore - so she chugged it, which lowered her IQ by 30 points (at least), and made her mentally unstable. 

I visited her little hut in some random woods, one day.  I got back into her life, and showed her my own.  I was doing okay, with a nice apartment. She eventually wanted to get back together, one winter night - so I picked her up.  We hung out for a while, but I had to work the next day, and didn't want to leave her alone with my stuff, so I drove her into the woods; (she was staying with some other guy - but she couldn't get ahold of him) - and I left her in the cold woods, at night - basically naked.  

Haven't heard from her since, and hopefully she just blocked my number.   I'm too much of a pussy to reach out to her family.  

In high school, I told this shy, cute girl that no one wanted her around - because I didn't want anyone to know that I basically raped her, when she was drunk - least of all my new girlfriend - after I dumped the double abortion girl.  The shy girl chugged a bunch of pills that night, and we all heard over the intercom on Monday - that she passed away.

That's probably when my anger started getting out of hand, actually - I just suppressed it; I saw it as a weakness, more than a problem that needed to be dealt with.  


In my twenties I had a long relationship with a girl - this was after I broke up with my prostitute girlfriend, (for cheating on me - imagine the irony, but I was completely serious and felt justified, despite all the dick sucking that I gave and received) - oh, right, and before I scooched back into her life, and eventually left her in the woods.  This new girl was a chubby girl I started flirting with on Facebook - we were on the same swim team in high school, and I guess she wanted some dick. 

It turned into a three or four year relationship; I always felt good about my long relationships, because they made me feel like a reliable, committed person.  I was so bored, though.  She didn't like to fuck as much as my past girls, (twice a day wasn't enough for me, because the way I saw it - my dick could get hard again; why waste it?)

Also, she was a graphic designer - always on her laptop making these dumb logos with Photoshop. She was cute enough, but I didn't find her interesting, or funny, or dark enough - I always needed shit to get fucked up, when it came to "playful conversation". 

She'd always say, "you're doing it again..." When I started playing with her mental boundaries - and there were quite a few; she didn't want to talk about her shits, or fucking on her period during a heavy flow, or farting in my face while I jerk off and eat her ass - to be fair, I ate her ass and got her to eat mine, but she didn't want to be shat or farted on.  

She let me piss on her sometimes, if we were fucking all night - mostly holidays like my birthday, and promotions at work.  

I wasn't happy.  I thought I needed more, but I really just needed help.  I started to get violent with her - testing the water with hard ass slaps and rough thrusts - harder nipple pinching.  She was surprisingly into it.  

"You were rough with me," she said after the first time.  "Maybe I like it rough," she added.  

I don't even remember what I said - some bullshit that popped into my head - it was always bullshit, just for the sake of feeling clever.  

One night I was pissed about some shit from work.  I didn't even mention it - I just wanted to drink it away and fuck.  

She was on her period, but she gave up and let me get in a double creampie, on top of that old fucked up looking beach towel and some other stained ones - it took an hour for that double creampie, and I was drunk and slobbering all over her - fingering her ass and being rough with her tits.  

"Can you maybe chill a little?" I remember her saying.  

"Oh, sure." I said, or something like that.  I was always reasonable.  That's definitely when my dick started getting hard again, for the second round, because I just started hate fucking her from behind - so hard - like I never fucked before.  

She was pretty vocal and kept looking back at me.  "You're hurting me..."

"Shut up bitch, you like it rough." I was trying to hurt her and also cum as fast as possible, before she objected too much.    Plan worked out, because she started cumming hard, and her pussy got all juicy and clinched up - I couldn't handle that for more than a minute of hard fucking.

It was the best sex we ever had, and she toppled over on the bed, all twitching.  My dick was soft and mushy like a dirty sponge covered in sour cream and rusty chocolate syrup, before I let her ass go.  

She laughed a little and said it was the best sex ever.  That's when I decided to take the big shit I'd been holding, all over her beautiful, fluffy pink tits - and I pissed in her hair and face.

She screamed when I shat.  I remember that.  Then nothing. She just stayed on her back - motionless, with her head to the side, and eyes closed - waiting for me to finish pissing on her. 

I never did that again, because she told me she'd break up with me - but I always fucked her that hard, after that.  

I guess maybe that kind of fucked up relationship might have gone on for a good few more years, despite me finding her somewhat boring - but she got too drunk one night, and choked on her vomit in her sleep, and just... passed away, just like that.  

That shit fucked me up hard.  Where was my stripper girlfriend? *I thought to myself* (the one I would years later leave naked in the woods).  It only took me a year of self destructive drinking, before I thought to reach out to her.  

She hadn't seen me in years.  She was still brain fucked from the seventy hits of acid.  I kept showing up at the club with gifts, and telling her I loved her, because she was so interesting and fucked in the head - devoid of boundaries, like me.  

I was fucking her a couple years later, after she got kicked out of her dude's house.  Anyway, that relationship obviously ended terribly, in the end - regardless of what actually happened to her.

I don't want to know.  I kept leaving her in bad places, which I'm sure made her feel like some stray, getting dumped - some trash getting dumped on the side of the road - an old, dumped sofa; she was only thirty, still a couple years younger than me.  

I just didn't trust her to not invite junkie dudes over, while I was at work - fucking and shooting up, and probably stealing my video games.  That's how shit turned out the first time, so I guess I didn't love her enough to trust her in the first place...

Should have thought about that, but foresight is 20/20 -  If you use it, or care to.  I didn't. 

Then there's the big one.  The one I've been avoiding, maybe even subconsciously. I got paid by an old dude, to eat thanksgiving with him naked and spread my asshole for like... fifty bucks - this was before I stopped stripping, and just let her do it; she made way more, anyway.  

He took pictures of me and kept calling me little darlin.  I was forced to cum multiple times and let him lick my butthole.  He said it was a bit ripe.  Then he gave me half a Viagra and got me baked off his weed.

He invited this other 18 year old stripper over, and had me fuck the gay dude in the ass.  His asshole was messed up, and he shit on my cock a little.  I came in his ass eventually, but it took forever.  He was sucking off the old dude, which I didn't even offer to do - probably just should have done that, but I don't know.  

Now I'm working at a dusty warehouse, doing the easiest job on earth - load trucks with small boxes.  I come home to my mountain of trash (mostly beer cans), and jerk off to pussy porn and kitty cat girls until I pass out.

  I meow at everyone at work and call myself a pretty kitty.  They all think I'm insane, but they're used to it, and some meow back now - or I'll just hear someone meowing on the other side of the dock - and then I'll start meowing, and two other people will meow a few times, probably out of boredom, if no one's playing music.  

I think I just snapped, at some point - now I talk all weird half the time - like, ahh yeah...  Pretty kitty be having a truck to load, and load it so gooooood...  Mhhhmmm..  meow.  

Everyone thinks I'm just hilarious.  I do too, but I'm just glad I found a way to kill the old me.

  

Drops of salty shiny sweat beads formed on my forehead as I finalized my second last subject in college for the fall semester. Being an international student I had no idea how the college course enrollment system worked. What I learned was that I needed a minimum of 13 credits and had to enroll in my classes online but had to attend them physically. I was done with enrolling in classes worth 12 credits and had chosen all the subjects I truly wanted to study. So I just needed 1 credit and decided to take up a course with a light load. I wanted a subject that would require the least amount of effort. My dry fingers typed and scrolled furiously as I tried looking up subjects with low credits. Then my hands paused, I let out a huge sigh and pushed my laptop away. 

&#x200B;

Deciding to take a break from the frustrating work, I lay on the bed. My laptop screen was still open in front of me, shining a little too bright for my tired eyes. My eyelids got heavier and I struggled to handle their weight. Before I knew it, I had taken a three-hour-long ‘nap’. “Shit, shit, shit…” I whispered in a croaky broken voice as I woke up and reached out for my phone still groggy and half asleep. I saw the laptop screen which was now completely blank from being in sleep mode and so was I. While I was switching my laptop back on, an idea struck my head. What if I just googled the easiest course available along with the name of my university? I wouldn’t have to individually check the credit system and course load for each subject. 

&#x200B;

I quickly typed the name of my university followed by the question where I misspelled ‘subject’ as ‘sobjert’ but fortunately, google realized what I was trying to ask. The first few search results were completely unrelated but the fourth result was from Reddit. It was an archived Reddit thread in which someone had asked the same question as me. There was only one answer which had the subject code “191X8G”. That was it, no mention of the subject name or context. However, my still half-asleep brain got what it wanted. I went back to the tab where my college course enrollment website was open and typed the subject code. The code was accepted and guess what, it was a one-credit course. I pumped my fist in the air and without even seeing the name of the course, subject, or any other information, I hit the ‘enroll’ button.  

&#x200B;

Three months later, I was on campus ready to meet and mingle with my new collegemates. In the busy weeks before my arrival, I had completely forgotten to check my class schedule. When I finally did glance through it, one class stuck out. “Fear Psychology Practical”, was the name of the class and it was taught by “Dr. S. Brown”. The reason it stuck out to me was not because of the name but because of the class timing, “Friday, 09:30 PM”. I was taken aback temporarily but that was only till I saw that I only had to attend three lectures on the subject in the entire semester. I became glad and relaxed. I didn’t look up any other information on the course because I thought that if Reddit says something is easy then who am I to argue. So in my blissfully unaware state, I started college and even made some sweet friends. I sort of started to understand what our early human ancestors who traveled far to migrate to new continents must have felt like. If you dream of being in a world completely different from where you are born, who knows you might just experience it. It was all stuff of movies minus the student debt which kept me grounded.  

&#x200B;

Before I knew it, Friday had arrived and after explaining to all my confused collegemates that their party plans clashed with my class schedule, I was on the bus to attend Dr. S. Brown’s class. Campus glowed differently in the night light and it took me twenty minutes to find the building mentioned in the schedule. I rushed to the new building which I had never seen before. The moment I stepped into the building, I felt different. It was like the feeling of watching sci-fi movies, listening to glitches in the matrix stories, experiencing thundering rain, or to describe it more accurately, being in a dream. The lighting of the building was so different that I don’t even have the words to describe it. 

&#x200B;

The walls were yellow but unlike any shade of yellow I’ve seen before or since. You’d think you’ve seen all yellows that the world has but no, you won’t find this yellow on a computer color scale. This thing was from elsewhere or at least that’s how I felt when I saw it. I looked at my schedule again, ‘the thirteenth floor’. I looked at the elevator and suddenly, the dreamlike out-of-the-world feeling was infected with a different feeling. You know you’re scared when you go to a new place and adjust to a new environment. There is always this small sense of nervousness and fear. I had carried that feeling when I came to college but the moment I looked at the elevator, I felt a sudden overwhelming sense of new fear. It was as if I had watched a horror movie and was scared that I’d be attacked by a grotesque being but this description doesn’t do the feeling justice because this fear was more profound and silent. I felt it so clearly and yet there was no logic for this fear to exist. 

&#x200B;

I looked around and saw the stairs. I’d be lying if I said that the stairs looked any more appealing than the elevator but I knew if I didn’t walk up those stairs, I’d be standing in that hallway for eternity from that paralyzing fear. So I took fast but unsure steps towards the ancient-looking marbly stairs. Before I took my first step up, I looked back at the elevator. The floor sign lit up and soft elevator music started to play indicating that the lift was coming to the floor I was on. As the music got louder, so did the pounding of my heart. All I knew at that moment was that I did not want to see the doors of that elevator open and so I ran up the stairs as fast as I could. 

&#x200B;

The further I went up, the dimmer the lights got. By the time I got to the 10th floor, it was pitch black. I couldn’t see anything. Again, the darkness was such a different kind of dark. I was now very scared and questioned the entire idea of going to class. I could still go back. How was there no one in the building? I looked below at the dizzying curves of the ten floors I had already climbed. The staircase seemed scarier from up top. I looked at my phone and took a deep breath. Nope, that doesn’t just happen in movies because I actually physically stood there and took three deep breaths. Everyone was probably already in class. If I didn’t make it to class in the next fifteen minutes, I’d be late and lose my attendance. This was supposed to be a blow-off class and I couldn’t let this stupid feeling take away my credit. The class was most probably a night school thing and so the number of students wouldn’t be that high. 

&#x200B;

I told myself I was scared about nothing. This was just like going to the living room as a kid after turning off the lights and getting back to bed. As a kid, I’d start imagining a demon following me and scare myself for no reason. It was natural for me to be scared about navigating a new space all by myself but that was what I signed up for when I decided to attend University in a new country. I turned on the flashlight of my phone and started walking up. I decided not to look around and get this over with as soon as possible. 

&#x200B;

I had only gone up about two or three steps when I heard what I thought was another pair of footsteps. They matched the rhythm and speed of mine but they were definitely not my footsteps. “Oh f\*\*\* no!” I whispered under my breath and started to run. The footsteps behind me were running too. There was no way I was going to look back and so before I knew it, and obviously this was going to happen because well, I’m me, and so, I tripped while running. The footsteps behind me stopped too. My phone fell with me and slid a little further than my hands reach. The flash was still on and it lit up the sign in front of me, ‘the eleventh floor’. 

&#x200B;

I then heard a small footstep not that far off behind me. It was a tiny footstep followed by another. My heart felt like it would explode and I thought I was going to die. Another small footstep, but I was stuck in my position with fear. I wanted to get up but I was just way too scared to move. My fingers and arm hurt from the position they were in but I couldn’t even move my fingernail. The small single footsteps got louder all of a sudden and they started running. I felt a strong arm grab my foot. I screamed out loud and felt myself getting pulled behind. I grabbed the railing and kicked back as strongly as I could. As soon as I felt the grip on my foot ease I got up and continued running upstairs. I picked up my phone but still couldn’t dare to look behind me at who or what had grabbed me. I was now breathing faster than ever. I couldn’t hear the footsteps following but I knew my nose was bleeding and my arms were scratched up too. The leg that had been pulled hard also burned and was probably bruised but there was no time to check.            

&#x200B;

Just two more floors and I could get to class, a.k.a, get to safety. I rushed up the stairs but this time not only did I hear the mirroring double footsteps again, which now for some reason felt like there were more than one behind me, but also the steps for the twelfth floor were wet. Not like slippery and not dry from mopping wet but like someone’s throwing down buckets of water wet. A small light lit up in the corner of my eye. It was the elevator that was coming to the eleventh floor. I could faintly hear the elevator music too. Seeing the gushing water coming down from the twelfth floor, I reconsidered going up the stairs. Taking the elevator could possibly be faster and my chances of tripping or falling would be slimmer too. However, whoever was behind me could catch up if I tried to go toward the elevator. 

&#x200B;

I had to take that decision in a split second. I took one look at the creepy elevator and started going up the stairs. My pace was slower but I still went up as fast as I could. Despite the sound of flowing water, I could still hear splashes of steps going at the same pace as mine behind me. I wanted to cry then but I didn’t have the time or opportunity to process whatever was happening. I just had to get to class. I was gripping the railing of the staircase hard so as to not fall but had a tighter death grip on my phone. 

&#x200B;

I somehow made it halfway when I saw a rough outline of a figure on the twelfth floor. My heart sank and I felt like I’d puke. I stopped for a second but the splashing sounds behind me did not. I knew it would only be seconds before whoever was behind me caught up. I only had two options and the second I thought about what to do, I realized I had four options. I could go up, I could run back down, I could stay still, or I could jump down the side of the railing. I felt like I’d probably die regardless of what I chose. But I would most definitely die if I jumped. It was an eleven stories jump and I’d without a doubt critically injure myself. 

&#x200B;

I don’t know what came over me but I was in no state to think anything through. I started to go up and the flashlight on my phone continued to illuminate the figure. I got very close to the figure when I was finally able to see the person in front of me. The man was much taller and had a crazy grin on his disheveled face. I knew this was the end of me. “I am Prof. S. Brown,” the man said in the creepiest way making me want to die from disgust. He moved to his right making space for me. “Sorry about the water, some pipe broke,” the man continued. I could see him a lot better now. He was a plump man wearing an old-looking oversized brown coat over a maroon sweater and blue denim jeans. His eyes were light blue and he had brown hair. No, scratch that description, his eyes looked like he was high on drugs and crazed to the max. “Watch your step or you might hurt yourself,” he said with a giggle. The man continued to giggle till I reached the twelfth floor, that is, the floor that he was on. “This way,” he said and started walking towards a room on the twelfth floor.   

&#x200B;

If this was any other day and if I were in any other circumstances, I would have followed the man wherever he went. On that day, I quickly, but not as quickly as I’d like, opened the lock screen on my phone which directly opened my class schedule. The schedule clearly said, ‘thirteenth floor’. I looked back at him. He had stopped and was looking directly into my eyes. He wasn’t giggling anymore. He wasn’t even smiling.       

&#x200B;

I decided that even if this man was supposed to be my teacher, I would rather just skip this class and lose my credit than be around him. I quickly ran towards the floor above and I saw Prof. S. Brown run towards me at full speed. The thirteenth floor did not have as much water as the eleventh or twelfth floor and I could clearly hear four-five people running behind me. I ran like I had never run before and yet it felt like I couldn’t have been slower. 

&#x200B;

I made it to the thirteenth floor and literally ran for my life. I used my flashlight to look at the door of every room and finally came across one that said, ‘Fear Psychology Practical’. I felt hot tears brimming up my eyes as I tried the doorknob. It didn’t open. I kept trying the doorknob frantically. I heard the running steps starting to catch up and simultaneously faint elevator music filled my ears. I was still trying the doorknob. Both the lift and the steps started to get louder and louder. As if it was open the whole time, the door opened and I practically fell inside the room. The door closed itself behind me as I dropped to the ground for the second time and this time my phone fell much harder. I quickly got up in the dusty dimly lit room and went back to latch the door shut behind me. The room wasn’t very big and it was empty. I picked up my phone but it was dead. It had completely stopped working and the flashlight feature had stopped working too. I felt the tears go down my face but I quickly wiped them off. 

&#x200B;

I couldn’t hear anyone outside the door but I knew they had to be out there. I looked around the room and saw a window. I ran towards it and looked outside. There was a broken water pipe that went down the outer walls right by the window but there was also a tiny ladder just beside it. It went all the way down to the ground floor. For the first time that night, I felt like I was a fortunate person but that thought was quickly replaced by the thought of the lack of practicality of the ladder. It was too tiny for me to use it. 

&#x200B;

The doorknob started to rattle. Someone outside was trying to turn the knob ferociously. I looked around and saw nothing but layers of dust in a wooden room. I looked at the door and even though it was tightly shut, it didn’t feel like a safe barrier. And finally, I looked at the window. The tears came up again. My body was cold and the hot tears felt like a sign of my defeat. I closed my eyes and did what I had done after entering the building. Despite the situation, I took a moment and took three deep breaths. The door was being pounded now and it was loud. 

&#x200B;

I went to the window and pulled it up. The glass slid up with ease. I put my phone in my jeans pocket and climbed out the window. This was the second time I felt fortunate because most of my pants don’t have pockets. I don’t how I climbed down that freaking shaky tiny ass ladder but I did. And I ran back to a world that didn’t seem or feel dreamlike weird.   

&#x200B;

As soon as I sat on the bus which would take me back to my apartment, my phone started to work. It opened my class schedule straight away. My attendance for the day's class was marked as ‘present’ and the next ‘Fear Psychology Practical’ class had a completely different address.

&#x200B;

I got home, took a shower, and put some first aid on my wounds. It was late at night and I was just thinking of what to do next when a thought struck me. A thought that made my heart stop, my mouth go dry, send chills down my spine, and make my body numb. I opened my phone again. The date for my next ‘Fear Psychology Practical’ class was in a couple of months but the class address was the address of my apartment.

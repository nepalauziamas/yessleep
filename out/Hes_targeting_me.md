For those of you who haven't read the first story, I'll include a summary.

A few days ago, a stranger pulled into one of the fields surrounding my area as I was making bird noises in a tree, and was watching me in a creepy way. When he left in his black van with tinted windows, I left the tree and tried to go home. He ended up approaching the tree from behind, and attempted to grab me, but soon realized I was no longer there. He went searching around for me, and almost got me too, but a deer went running, and it spared me enough time to escape. I hid in my bunker and ate Doritos, believing that this was over.

He wasn't gone for long. I heard a car door shut while my parents were away. I assumed that one of them was home, but I soon saw that the driveway was empty. I heard something that could've been laughing, and ran for cover. 

I took some pictures while I was running, and one of them caught a blurry outline of him. (These photos will be in my profile for all who want to see them.) He was still holding the piece of red paper, although his hands cannot be seen in the picture. 

He pursued me through the trees with alarming speed, but I was able to lose him, given that I knew how to navigate through the woods and he did not.

I stayed silent for quite some time, waiting in a bush. He eventually left, and I was able to go back home an hide in my bunker.

Just a few hours after I went to bed, I heard one of the guard cats let out a low growl, and heard a scream and a lot of cursing. This was enough to wake me up. I gathered what supplies I needed from my bunker, and hurried to get my parents.

I know that this wasn't just an auditory hallucination, because my sister heard it as well, and that particular guard cat was frightened. My parents checked the house and went to bed saying "It must've been a dream."

I saw him in the window and called for my parents. He fled before they arrived, and they were angry because they believed that I was pulling a prank on them.

I spent the rest of the night in my bunker, hiding. He didn't come back after my parents checked the house, or else the guard cats would've torn him up, and we'd see bloody scraps of clothing scattered about the front of our house.

If you leave a comment, I'll most likely respond a short time after. My comments aren't visible, so you may have to go into my profile. (Thank you, GetOverItBroDude for your comment on this issue.) This is because I'm a new user, so Reddit doesn't want me to farm karma through comments. Go into the section labeled "Comments" and they should be there. If I answered your comment, your username should be at the top of the reply comment.

I'd originally thought that this was a one-time only sort of thing, but it has continued. I believe he's targeting me, for whatever the reason may be. I don't know why he's doing it, but it doesn't look as if it's going to stop soon. I'll be sleeping in my well-prepared bunker from now on.

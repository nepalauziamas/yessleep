I'm a folklorist, and recently I was in the Los llanos region of Columbia searching for El Silbón, The Whistler who takes the bones of drunkards.

I was given the opportunity to stay with a small family in a rural village where there had been a number of sightings of this spirit. If someone had told me this story before I experienced what I had, I would not believe them. I figured that a group like this one would be willing to hear me out.

It was a pleasant spring evening, about seven at night. I was sitting with two members of a Colombian family. An elderly woman who looked to be in her sixties, and her son who looked about my age (around 30). Their home was decorated with an eclectic collection of spiritual items. Candles of various colors, statues of the Madonna, and the smell of sage permeated the air of their small home. Chickens ran freely around the property to be sacrificed and eaten. If you know your history at all then you'll know a lot of this is due to colonialism. The African diaspora was forced to hide their spiritual beliefs behind catholic imagery. Over time practices merge and you get practices like Santeria.

Laura, wearing a white dress and a beautiful many-colored beaded necklace, sat across from me and told me the dangers of what I was researching.

"You should not go out into the night, I know that El Silbón will be there, and he might put you in his bag" she warned.

"I'm not worried about that, but I would like to see this creature if he does exist." I hoped my skepticism didn't show too much, I didn't want to be disrespectful, but I know that I'm not a very good actor.

"I can take her out there, she'll be safe with me" Juan Chimed in, taking a break from the beer he was nursing, he had the confidence of someone who was a few drinks in.

"You especially can not go, you know he loves to take men that are drunk" Laura scolded despite her firmness I could hear the fear in her voice. She believed firmly that her boy was in danger.

Truthfully, at the moment I thought to myself that if this creature really does exist, and it really does prey on drunk men then I would want very much for Juan to come with me. At the very least even if The Whistler didn't make an appearance I would know that we did everything we could.

Juan laughed and pulled a dagger out of his pocket that reflected the fiery light of an adjacent candle. "El Silbón is no match for my blade, I will protect myself, and I will protect Andrea, who will be by my side."

"I know that I can not stop either one of you, you are strong-willed. But I want to give you something to protect yourself Andrea" Laura walked over to a wooden drawer, and picked out a wooden box, and handed it over to me. I thanked her and put the box in my bag along with my camera, and a few bottles of water.

We walked out into the night, Juan holding a beer, and the sound of animals in the wilderness surrounded us. A chirp, a scuttle, the howling of a dog in the distance. The stars above us lit the landscape, if we never saw a monster, this was worth the plane ticket.

"Do you hear that? I think it's a whistle" Juan feigned worry.

"I hear it's worse when the whistling stops" I joked, and Juan pushed on the arm, laughing and throwing me off balance.

I pulled my camera out of my bag to get a picture of the land, and stars. I snapped a few pictures, of the stars, and fields that lay before me. A mountain somewhere off in the distance peeking through an overhang of clouds in the cool air. I put my camera back into my bag and looked behind me, the house was a good distance behind us, we had walked at least a couple of miles by now. I took a drink from a bottle of water and motioned it to Juan for him to drink. Juan, however, was a few feet away from me pissing into the grass. If this El Silbón didn't kill Juan then I just might.

Juan zipped his jeans, and we both listened to the howling wind. The deep moaning that flew through the mountains and fields. I remember being a kid in the winters of Utah when my mother told me that were the cries of pilgrims that died on the trail.

Then Juan turned to me

"Andrea do you hear that?"

" Fuck off Juan"

"No, really, listen" Juan sounded serious this time, even afraid.

I listened and he was right, there was a whistling. Soon enough it was unmistakable, a loud whistle, a tone that went up and back down again. I could see that Juan was straightening himself up, he walked in a straight line like he was trying to pass a field sobriety test.

"He goes after drunken men" Juan's voice shook, he threw the beer as far from himself as he could. We both started to run toward the house, and the whistling got quieter, but as we ran, the house always seemed fixed at the same distance away from us. We were running again, and again, through the same patch of field. The stars that once beautifully lit our way now loomed over us, voyeurs in the cold sky.

He was there in front of us, towering. A large bag was hoisted over his shoulder that dragged to the ground. He was easily twice as tall as Juan who stood greater than six feet himself. He had a tattered hat that shadowed his eyes, and a mouth that was gaunt and frowned in a perpetual sadness like chewing on the body of Brutus.

He picked up Juan by the hair as he screamed. El Silbón said nothing as he slammed Juan's face repeatedly onto the grass until Juan stopped screaming. But I could tell he was still alive, his breaths jagged, his eyes pleading, and blood and tears caked his face. The smell of iron and alcohol carried through the still howling wind.

Then El Silbón with Juan dangling from his hand revealed his other hand which was full of long sharp claws. He tore open Juan's skin, tossing away meat, and organs like a child hollowing out a pumpkin at Halloween. I knew what he wanted, and I stood there transfixed. I pulled my camera out of my bag to take a picture, this had to be worth it. I still wish I could have saved those pictures.

El Silbón took his bag, and laid it on the ground, he tossed Juan's bones into them. His skeleton was holding the dagger as it was tossed in.

The creature stood there staring at me with his bag on his shoulder once again. Then the bag started to rustle, and I could hear tearing, El Silbón dropped down to his knees and crushed the camera that I had left on the ground. Shit. Bones fell clanging on each other from the bag to the ground.

They started to move and form together, a tower of skeletons, femurs kicking, ulnas wrists looking for phalanxes that clawed at nothing. A great tower was built, that overtook the height of El Silbón. All of the souls that had been taken were together now, and they wanted revenge. A great arm wrapped around El Silbón's neck and squeezed so tightly that his head popped off, his hat parachuting down to the ground. Before this horrid skeletal menagerie crushed his head, I could see his eyes. They weren't hollow, but a hazel, with deep sadness to them. The skulls chattering, and the wind laughing through their foramina.

I tried running toward the house again, and the creature hobbled after me, waving back and forth like it could barely stand. It was drunk, a giant boney abomination made of the bones of drunkards. I could hear its slurring voice

"Come back here bitch, let me get some of that" the teeth chattered, a thousand drunken voices whooping and hollering without lungs to scream.

"Fuck you, you're a fucking slut. Come here" I ran, and it hobbled.

"Getting tired now, lie down and I'll give a big boney kiss" the bones shook and chattered.

I was getting tired, I had my knees in my hands and I was panting. The horrible creature was not far behind me, whispering unspeakable things.

Then I remembered the box that Laura had given me. I pulled out of my bag and opened it to reveal what I hoped would protect me. It wasn't a talisman or bottle of potion, it was a pistol, and it was loaded.

I pointed at the monstrosity and shot at it, it hissed as bones snapped, and fell to the ground. I shot again, and more bones fell, it was working. I couldn't believe it was working. Soon, there was a mismatch of skeletons lying on the field. I saw the bottom half of a skull that moved and whispered.

"Andrea, it's me Juan, you have to help me."

"Oh Juan" I said, and walked over to his skull. I picked up his head, and held it in front of me. 

"Give me a smooch, baby" it cackled. 

I threw the jaw to the ground and smashed it with my boot.  He was influenced by the other drunk skeletons. Men are all the same. 

I made it back to the house, I didn't have too much trouble convincing Laura of what happened though she was filled with sorrow.  El Silbón might not be out there anymore, but there are no shortage of tormented souls that roam the Colombian wilderness.

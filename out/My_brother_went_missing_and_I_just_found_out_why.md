My brother went missing last year and a week later, his body was found in the river. Losing him was the hardest thing I’ve ever been through. He was there when our dad died. For weeks, he let me sleep with him in his bed because I had nightmares over Dad’s death. It was determined that it was a suicide. He jumped off the bridge and drowned. For months, I went through everything he owned trying to figure out why he did what he did. I looked through everything in his room, his jackets, shoes, even the box under his bed, which I still cringe remembering what was in there. On the anniversary of his death, I found one of his jackets in the hall closet, and I smiled remembering how much he wore it. I put it on, smiling. I looked at the arms seeing how much bigger he was than me. His arms were so big, that my hands didn’t even go through the armholes. I put my hands in my pockets and felt a post-it note.  I took it out and goosebumps ran over my entire body. “It wasn’t a suicide.”  


  
 It felt like the blood in my body was replaced with ice.  Had I not seen this before? Why didn’t I notice this? Was this recently placed here? I ran into his room and started looking at everything. After a few minutes, I bursted into tears and fell into his bed. I couldn’t handle going through this again. It’s probably just some sick prank. Who would do this, though? I woke up sometime later. I didn’t realise I had fallen asleep. I couldn’t have been asleep longer than a couple hours. My head hurt and my face felt puffy. I took a deep breath, deciding to take a shower to try and make me feel better. I went into the bathroom, locking the door and undressing. I opened the shower curtain and turned the water to scalding. “Perfect,” I say as I get in. I wet my hair and my body, thinking about everything that happened today. Sam was such a happy person, there’s no way it could’ve been a sucide. Did I miss the signs?  


  
  There’s absolutely no way I did. He was my best friend.  He was there for me through everything. I felt my eyes sting thinking about it. I washed my hair and stopped for a second, realising something. He left a suicide note, it was found in his car, in the glovebox. I never read it, it was too painful, and neither did my mom. It was too painful for us. I decided that today was going to be the day I read it.  I wanted to touch something that he touched. If this was the last thing he wrote, I had to read it. I finished my shower and put my clothes on and went to my room. I breathed shakily as I opened my dresser to get the letter. I knew one day I would want to read it so I put it in my dresser.   
The letter was addressed to me and to my mom.  
“I’m sorry. If you’re reading this, It means I succeeded. I miss you guys. I’m watching over you both. I love you mama and I love you,  Nugget.” I broke out into sobs reading it. I kept reading it over and over again until I noticed something. He never called me Nugget. He always either called me Stinky or Morg. Never Nugget.  
Someone who called me Nugget was my mom. She was the only one who called me Nugget. My blood ran cold. Goosebumps covered my entire body.Did my mom murder my brother? I heard a car come in the driveway. My mom was home from work. I quickly put the note back in my dresser and laid on my bed, getting my phone from my bedside table and quickly acted like I was just watching TV on my phone. She came into my room and I jumped. “Oh hey mom! You scared me!” I was shaking under my covers. “Hey baby! I’m gonna go grocery shopping if you want anything?” I shook my head. “I’m good, thank you though! Be safe.” She nodded and left. When I saw that she left, I got up quickly and got one of the letters my mother had written to me. I put them side to side, analysing both of them. I felt my heart sink when I realised the handwriting was the same. I ran to my brother’s room and grabbed one of his notebooks from the shelf and the jacket. I went back to my room and opened it to an open page and placed it on the desk with the letters. The post it note and the notebook had the same writing to it.

 My brother’s handwriting had a slight slant and cursiveness to it. The letter was sort of cursive but the letters were different and there was no slant. It was also written in blue ink. My brother hated anything but red pens, it’s the only thing he would write with. I went to my mom’s room and saw she only had black pens. Terror filled my entire body as I had a sudden realisation. Did my mom murder my brother? I called Mark, who was Sam’s best friend.  Him and I had gotten pretty close since Sam died. I grabbed a bag from my closet and was putting everything in, locking my bedroom door as a precaution.  
“Hey Morgan, What’s up?” My voice shook. “I don’t have time to explain. I need you to come and get me, now. Hurry.” I tried catching my breath but I was freaking out too much. I didn’t know how much time I had before my mom came home. I grabbed my laptop and my phone charger and quickly put it in the bag. “Okay, I’m on my way. Give me 10 minutes.” “Please stay on the phone with me until you get here.” “I will.” I saw my mom’s car pull in. Fuck. I put my phone in my hoodie pocket and grabbed my keys which had my pepper spray on them. I prayed I wouldn’t have to use it against my mother. I walked out with my backpack on and my hands in my backpack. I had to come up quickly with a lie so she wouldn’t be suspicious. She walked in with a couple of bags. “Where are you going?” She asked. “Oh! I’m going to the drive-in with Bella!” “I thought Bella moved away?” Fuck.

 “Oh there’s another Bella in my class! She’s really sweet. I’ll see you later!” “Morgan, wait, I don’t want you going out tonight. You know what tonight is.” I felt like I was gonna throw up at any time. The lump in my throat grew. “I need to escape for a little mom, it's really hard.” She grabbed my wrist, pulling me in. “You’re not going anywhere.” I pulled back, causing her to stumble. “It’s just for a few hours. I’ll be back!” I pleaded. I inched backwards to the door, praying Mark would hurry. She walked away and I breathed a sigh of relief until I saw her walking back with a knife.

 I screamed, “Mom what the fuck!” “You kids just hate to listen to me. Sam never listened to me either and look where that landed him. He ended up just like your dad and now you’re gonna end up just like him. Just then, I heard the car pull up. She looked at the window and I took my chance to get the pepper spray out and sprayed her in the face, turning around quickly and running. I heard her scream and she ran after me. Why the fuck did we have to have to have such a long driveway? I heard Mark yell my name as I felt a strong pain in my leg. I screamed as I fell and I felt my mom tackle me. The last thing I heard was Mark tackling her.  I woke up in the hospital and looked around to see Mark sitting in the chair. I sat up, wincing in pain. “What happened?”   
It turns out my brother knew what my mother was going to do and put the note in his jacket. She murdered my father and she murdered my brother. She admitted to it after only 30 minutes of interrogation. After going through months of therapy, I’ve finally accepted that it happened and I know everything is over now. Or at least, I hope.

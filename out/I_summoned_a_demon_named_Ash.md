(this is written on a phone so apologies for bad layout)


I’ll start from the beginning…

I was just chilling out with some friends on the couch, watching movies and eating a ton of snacks like typical teenagers do. We were watching The Conjuring when one my friends, Max said we should do a Ouija Board. 
“But we don’t even have a board” i said. “We can make one” Cassie said, my other friend. I was not down for this at all but the rest of my friends were.
“Fuck it” I said, and we went to go cut up some cardboard boxed from the garage. We looked up Ouija boards on our phones so we could copy down the correct layout. We lit some candles and got ready to play. 

One of my friends wanted to contact a past relative so we started there.
“Hello, we are calling upon Sarah’s past loved one. If you can here us let us know” we all changed whilst lighting circling the planchette over the board. After waiting for a few seconds the planchette slowly moved to YES. We all jumped in shock as we weren’t actually expecting this to happen.

After contacting Sarah’s past relative we decided to try contact a random spirit to make sure Sarah wasn’t just moving the planchette. 

“As we circle the planchette on this board, we call upon a near by spirit. Go to yes if one of you wants to contact us” We all chanted. The planchette quickly moved to yes. “What is your name” I said, my voice shaking in terror. The planchette slowly moved, “A-S-H” we all slowly said.
“How old are you Ash?” Max said buzzing with excitement . 
“2-6-0” 
“260 years old?” Cassie asked. The planchette moved to yes. 

After talking to Ash for a few minutes Cassie began to feel really nauseous. We ended the game and tried to help Cassie feel better. But little did we know this was the beginning of the horrific night Ash had planned for us. 

Soon Max and Sarah stared passing out and when awake they coughing up a lot of blood. I was so scared. All of a sudden i started seeing black shadowy figure everywhere before i passed out. 

Next thing i know me , Cassie, Sarah, Max and Ben were all laying in a pool of our own blood. A huge foggy figure standing over us. I screamed my head off in pure horror as the foggy figure standing over me had blood dripping from its rotten mouth. I wanted to throw up but i was paralysed.


I decided that while Ash was looking over the other i was going to run outside.
So when Ash went over to Sarah i ran for my life. I didn’t know what to do besides keep on running.


I’m currently hiding in my closet as the creepy figure walks around my home looking for me. I didn’t think it would follow me if i left the house but i was terribly wrong.

It’s been 2 minutes and it’s standing outside the closet. Goodbye….

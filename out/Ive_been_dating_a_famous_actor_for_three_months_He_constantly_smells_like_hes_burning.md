Do you know what a tumour smells like?

Oranges.

Not ripe ones. Rotten. The type you bite into and immediately regret it. I realised there was something not quite right with me when I smelled oranges on my kindergarten teacher. I made sure to tell her, every day. I’d walk in and catch that same stink in the air. Miss Weller was in her mid-thirties and always greeted me with a bright smile. When she opened her arms to pull me into a hug like every other morning, the smell was intoxicating. And when I wrinkled my nose and tried to sniff it out and find the source of rotten oranges, it hit me that it was Miss Weller’s head that smelled. Not her hair—her hair always smelled of lavender and strawberries. 

No, it was what was inside my kindergarten teacher’s head. Right inside her skull, I knew something was wrong. I told her one day. When the other kids were playing in the playground, I ran over to where she was bent over her flower garden planting roses  and smiled widely. “Your head smells of bad oranges.” I said, and Miss Weller looked shocked for a moment before laughing it off and telling me to go and play.

“But you do.” I said. “You smell of bad oranges.” 

The teacher settled me with a smile. “Well, I haven’t had any oranges. What do you mean, Mina?” 

I didn’t know what to say, because how was I supposed to describe it? 

"You just smell." I whispered. 

A few months later, Miss Weller stopped coming to school—and I learned from listening in on my parents hissed conversation, that my kindergarten teacher was very sick. It wasn’t long before she passed, and her flower garden was abandoned. I still went there to see if I could still smell the rotten oranges but the only smells were the Rose’s and Lavender planted for her. I guess I should preface this by saying I’ve had a strange sense of smell my whole life. When I was fourteen I was sitting in my middle school cafeteria talking to my friends, when I was attacked with the sudden aroma of chicken which was so potent in my nose and throat I thought I was going to throw up.

 I didn’t, thankfully. 

But Olivia Lennox, who had been sitting across the table from me, suddenly choked on a chicken drumstick. I remember her body faced down on the table in a halo of willowy blonde hair as Mrs Michael’s attempted the Heimlich manoeuvre and CPR to a lunch hall of traumatised kids. 

We were all expecting the chicken bone to fly out of Olivia’s mouth like in the movies, but when Olivia Lennox stopped making spluttering noises, and the teacher pressed her ear to the girl’s light pink t-shirt before jumping up and telling us all to stand back, I knew she was gone. Olivia has been talking about Summer vacation before she died. She was so excited to go to Italy. 

Reality is different from the movies. It’s a whole lot more cruel.

When people are destined to die, they actually die.

The end. 

I bet you wish you had a way to know when your time is up. People see it as a blessing, so they can complete their bucket list and enjoy life to the fullest. When it’s not your date, however, it’s different. I suddenly had the power to know how stranger’s and loved ones were going to die, just by the smell coming off of them— and yet my own death was a mystery. It made me wonder if I was dying too. Maybe I was connected with recently dead souls, as well as souls who were going to die soon. But according to my doctor’s checks, I was healthy. There was nothing wrong with me so what was happening to me?

The scents I caught didn't always match how someone was going to die. Olivia was a rare occasion when it actually did. 

It didn’t happen all the time. I managed to live a fairly normal life up until my teenagehood. People die, and it’s normal. That’s what I thought to myself at least—after  I caught the smell of popcorn and caramel when I walked past a little girl—or on the way home from school when the mail man greeted me with a smile, and I was suffocated with the smell of mouldy cheese.

I never saw a countdown or a time limit or anything to suggest when people would die. I just knew they were going to. The mail man’s death was in the newspaper several days later. He’d been struck by a drunk driver and killed instantly. As for the little girl, six year old Ellie Chambers had drowned in the local swimming pool. 

I couldn’t do anything about them. 


I considered it, but then I realised how crazy I’d sound if I ran up to some random person and told them they were going to die. Not just that, but I knew from their smell. I’d be labelled crazy. 

I learned to ignore it—as selfish as that sounds. 

I finished high school with decent grades and planned to go to college. I didn’t exactly have specific goals for a college or a major, I guess I was winging it. I wanted to see the world and distract myself from the suffocating smells. 

I was at our senior bonfire when I first got the whiff of gas. I was maybe two beers down and was already feeling it. We were all sitting around a raging fire and drunkenly singing and exchanging memories from our four years at Belleview High School, when I smelled it again. It was suffocating, a sharp, intense stink turning my stomach. I was suddenly all too aware of my classmates around me, their faces lit up in orange, wide smiles and glazed over eyes. 

I panicked. I mean, anyone else would panic if they had the same sense of smell. I jumped up from where I’d been sandwiched between my best friend and boyfriend and  stumbled over to the cooler of drinks, grabbing bottles of water. The others didn’t seem to notice me, enveloped in some story one of the cheerleaders was telling everyone. The smell was ready to turn over my stomach and I was swallowing down the taste of beer creeping back up. I doused the fire with trembling hands, and I didn’t stop pouring water into flickering orange flame until a warm hand was wrapped around my wrist. 

“Mina?” 

My boyfriend’s voice was white noise compared to the screech in my head. I didn’t notice I was crying until the empty bottle of water slipped from my hands.

I waited for someone to die. I waited for one of the cheerleaders to trip and fall, or a guy to start vomiting blood. But nothing happened. I was led back to my seat and I was trembling. The fire hadn’t been completely put out, but some kids were complaining, jumping to their feet and announcing they were going to get firewood. I kept to myself for the rest of the night, waiting for a death—and when one didn’t come I found myself filled with both confusion and relief. On the way home I fell in and out of sleep, my head bumping the window of my best friend’s car. 

The radio was playing mellow pop songs and my friends were talking about college admissions and a movie recently released they wanted to go and see. I remember joining in the conversation, laughing along with them, and revelling in the relief flooding me. Nobody was dead. I’d caught the scent of someone who was going to die, and I’d made sure to count every one in our class before I left. They were all there. All smiling and happy, and definitely not dead. So. The question haunted the back of my mind, despite me shaking it off and trying to be positive; trying to believe that I was finally rid of the stupid curse.

Who was going to die? 

As we neared my parents house, the question wouldn’t leave me alone. So much so that I suddenly felt like I was going to be sick. It came over me like a wave of ice water, knocking the breath from my lungs. I couldn’t breathe, suddenly, my chest heaving, my heart in my throat. I was lying face down in the back of my friend’s car when she jumped in the back and wrapped her arms around me in a hug so tight I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest.

In the corner of my eye I saw flashes, blue and red flashes blurring into one. My friend was sobbing into my shoulder, dampening my sweater but I couldn’t concentrate on her words. They weren’t fully going in. I heard “accident” and “ car” and all of me splintered apart. I’d known it was coming. 

That was all that went through my mind, that same tumultuous fucking thought. It was driving me crazy. I had smelled my mother’s death and I couldn’t stop it. How though? That’s what I keep asking myself—even today. How could I have known that the smell of gas had equaled my mom wrapping her car around a stop-sign? That’s the worst thing about whatever this is. It lets me know someone is going to die and its up to me to join up the fucking dots.

I was through joining up dots after my mom died. I got whiffs of people and stayed the hell out of it. 

I distanced myself from dad. I know it wasn’t my fault mom was dead, but I felt responsible knowing I could have stopped it. So, I got out of town at the age of 19. I started college but dropped out three months after making friends with a boy called Caleb. He was the oddball in class and kept to himself and his drawings. 

I asked him to hang out one day, and we ended up going back to his dorm and binging Game Of Thrones. He was my first real friend, and really the first person I’d connected with and allowed myself to get close to. I was hanging out in his dorm room helping him pick out sketches for an art competition. Caleb was an amazing artist. We were laughing over something trivial when he leaned over me to grab a brush—and I smelled it again. It wasn’t as strong as before, more of a hint when I inhaled deeply to make sure. 

Rotten oranges. 

The aroma brought back memories of flower gardens and a sweet woman’s smile. I couldn’t go through that again. Not with Caleb. Stupid Caleb with his dorky grin and obsession with Studio Ghibli movies.  

I dropped out of college the second I left his dorm, that rancid smell following me. I made sure to text him to see a doctor—and then I deleted and blocked him. I know it sounds cruel. It IS cruel. But you have to understand I can’t bear to be around people I know are dying and I can’t stop it. I don’t know how to stop it.  Even if Caleb got help and somehow survived it, the smell doesn’t go away. I like to think because the smell wasn’t as potent, maybe there was a chance Caleb could have survived. I’ve never had the heart to check after abandoning him.

So, here I am 5 years later. 

I moved to the city and got an apartment. 

Not exactly 5 stars but it works.

You’re here for the title, so I’ll get to the meat of it. Please bear in mind I will be changing the names of everyone mentioned to the characters in Bram Stoker’s Dracula, because I can’t think of aliases and I really don’t want to reveal names. 

I’m not the best at social interaction so when a work friend dragged me to a random party without specifying it was a party (she called it a “gathering of talented people”) which I could understand, since we were in the capital—well known for talented people or pretentious art students who live off of daddy’s buck. Anyway, the party was in some warehouse apartment which was on the shadier side of the city, so naturally, I started to get wary in the Uber ride there. I hadn’t spoken for most of the ride, more interested in my Duolingo lesson. I was on a four week streak.  “Where exactly is this party?”

I leaned over to my friend Calliope, shouting into her ear over the screamo on the radio. Luckily, she wore enough perfume to drown out any scent she might be harbouring. I’d initially been cold to her when we first met. I didn’t want to get attached to anyone. Calliope, however, had a certain charm, an energy I couldn’t say no to. 

She absorbed all positive energy and most of the time she drives me mad, but I love her. 

Unlike me she was an actual college student and worked part time at the antique store I’d found solace.  There were almost no customers and the people who did come in were either rich kids looking for something sparkly, or middle aged women with insane stories to tell. The kinds of stories I could turn into books if I knew how to write properly. Oh, man, the things I’ve heard. 

One woman once told me she was abducted by aliens who used her blood for glue. 

She was completely serious. 

“Relax!” Calliope was already high, flirting with the Uber driver, who was more interested in her cleavage. “It’s just round the corner.”

“Really?” Pressing my face against the window, I squinted into the night, blurs of colours from passing apartments and clubs dancing in my eyes. The city at night was my favourite. 

I liked that my thoughts were drowned out by booming music and screaming, and everyone’s individual smells came together in an intoxicating mix I couldn’t untangle. When the Uber pulled up to a towering apartment building, I knew I’d made a bad decision following Calliope to the so-called “gathering”. When I jumped out of the car, though, smoothing down my skirt and trying to brush down the frizz in my hair, I noticed very official looking security guards standing at the door.  Calliope grabbed my arm with an excited squeal. “See, I told you this was a fun idea!” 

I tipped my head back and frowned at what looked like a rooftop party.

“That looks like more than a gathering.” I shot my friend a skeptical smile.

Calliope rolled her eyes. “Okay, more than a gathering. You win. But cool, right?”

“Yeah, cool.” I nodded. But I was thinking about being in a confined space with stranger’s who no doubt had scents that I didn’t want to know. If I could stay outside, that would be my best bet.

Or I could plug my nose.

When Calliope waved two slips of paper in my face, I had to squint to read the blocky font.

Invitations.

The two of us hurried past the security guards after flashing our invitations, Calliope with a grin, and me waving it in the air awkwardly. When they waved us in I had to bite back of excitement. I’d never been to this type of party. Invite only seemed so exclusive. When we were presented with four flights of stairs, I started to trudge up them, sticking to Calliope’s side as she danced up each step in her heels. I could hear the thrum of music getting progressively louder, shaking the building. 

“Who cares?” Calliope was out of breath. She twisted around to grin at me, panting.  “I scored them from a guy in my English class. He got a ticket for Dua Lipa and gave us them for free.”

I realised how out of shape I was when I found myself fighting for my breath. “Lucky him.” 

She grabbed me and pulled me up the last few steps, the two of us dragging ourselves to a wooden door spray painted with graffiti. I expected a more exclusive way in, like a secret passageway, or a “what’s the password” guy behind the door. But it was good enough. 

I could already smell stale pizza and beer so it was going well. As long as the party was suffocated in smells I couldn’t place I would be okay. The trick was not seeking out the stink. 

The door opened, and we crashed through into a rooftop pool party, the crowd already moving under fluorescent lights which danced in my eyes, music blaring, and it was perfect. 

The only smells were the overbearing stink of cologne mixed with chlorine from the pool. 

Calliope nudged me.

“Mingle!” She shouted in my ear before bouncing off to greet a group of college kids waving coloured party cups. I started to follow her but stopped myself. Calliope and her friend’s were third year English Lit students. What would we talk about?

She had often expressed that her class were pretentious assholes, and I’d seen it in person when a guy who came to hang out with her, and then proceeded to go on a three hour rant about how Midsommer was “spiritual” and “had changed his life”. When Calliope had teased him I thought he’d laugh along and call himself out. But he was completely serious. 

Unsurprisingly, I glimpsed him among the others surrounding Calliope. Something told me he wouldn't appreciate my lack of knowledge of Ari Aster and A24 movies. 

I was told to mingle, so I tried. I joined a conversation between two girls who were both talking in Gen Z speak so I just smiled and nodded and acted like I understood. Moving towards the open bar, I grabbed a drink and found a spot on the side of the pool, dangling my legs in illuminated water rippling over my toes. The smell of chlorine masked everything else and it was comforting. I watched the party go on around me in a blur of colours and skin enveloping together, and I was content. The pool stayed empty to my confusion. It was warm enough for a midnight swim, and yet I watched girl’s and guy’s edge around it like it was filled with poison. If I had a swimsuit, and Calliope's confidenceI would have happily dove in. 

I glimpsed familiar faces swimming around in the crowd. B list Twitch streamers and Youtubers. The party was pretty chill though. It seemed like everybody knew everybody and were in some artistic profession. I was just happy to inhale pool fumes for the rest of the night. I mean, that’s what I thought. After an hour of sitting in the same spot choking on chlorine and staring at the pool like I was in some crazy trance, I realised my best friend wasn’t getting bored. I could vaguely hear her laughing loudly with her friends. I pulled out my phone to check the time and was hit in the face with that fucking bird notification. I’d closed the app halfway through my Duolingo lesson and he wasn’t happy, sending me urgent notifications. 

After a quick glance at the time, which was closing on midnight, I trudged through the last three questions. I was frowning at the screen, struggling to make out a Japanese phrase, when a laugh sounded from behind me. I thought it was at someone else so I ignored them until they laughed again.

“Is that Duolingo?”

The smell of spice and cinnamon suddenly hit me, and I turned to find a guy around my age holding a bright red apple. Not like he was going to eat it, more like he'd brought it to the party as an accessory. 

The fruit looked good, juicy and suddenly tempting enough to reach out and snatch from him. I wasn’t sure what to stare at. His face, which I vaguely knew, or the apple. 

He’d been on TV or maybe a movie I’d seen. I couldn’t place a name though. The guy stood out away from the crowd and brandished a white shirt which clung to him in all the right places, a pair of raybans pinning back dark brown bed-head. He was hot. And he looked pretty out of it. I didn’t know if it was drugs, or maybe he’d taken a nap, bruises shadowing his eyes. 

I didn’t really know what to say except, “What's with the apple?”

He raised a brow. "What's with the impromptu Duolingo lesson?" 

“It's fun.” I said, pocketing my phone.

“Well, so is holding an apple.”

I expected him to leave, taking the smell of spices and autumn leaves with him, but instead he hovered awkwardly, still grasping the apple. I figured breaking the ice would be a good idea, instead of the two of us standing together with him not saying anything, and me choking on his scent. He had a good scent though. Like someone had captured the smell of Fall. Petrichor and crushed leaves.

“You’re.. uh…” I racked my brains for a name. “That guy."

He smirked. “Oh, that guy? Yeah! Yeah, I’m “that guy” how did you know?”

I scrambled to correct myself. “No, I meant—”

“It’s Ren.” He said, the muscles in his face twitching into a smile. "I can go by 'that guy' too." 

Ren was a joker, but after the first few awkward jokes which didn’t land, he grabbed a seat next to me and talked about everything from his favourite video games, to the time he’d gotten food poisoning from bad shellfish. He was the type of guy who could keep you embroiled in a story which wasn’t going anywhere, or a joke which had died halfway through because he was too busy laughing to properly tell it. An extrovert at his prime. 

Ren was choking on whatever cocktail he’d grabbed to drink, halfway through telling me about his childhood dog, when a shadow suddenly loomed over the two of us. Ren glanced up, his mouth curved around the straw in his drink. There was a girl hovering over us looking less than impressed. In her hand was a drink, and at first I thought she was going to throw it over him, but she took a delicate sip from the straw, offering me an awkward smile. 

She was beautiful, and I mean beautiful and didn’t have to try. She wasn’t wearing anything special, a low cut t-shirt over shorts, and yet flaunted them effortlessly. When I drank her in, she looked half asleep, blinking at Ren through half-lidded eyes. She had bed-hair too, a crown of dark curls framing her face. The girl had the faint smell of mint. Nothing bad, just toothpaste– I think. “Are you an idiot?” She reached out and grabbed Ren’s wrist, pulling him to his unsteady feet. “We’ve gotta go. Now.”

The girl had an urgency in her tone, and from the sudden look in Ren’s eyes, like he was waking up from a trance, he nodded. “Right. Fuck. Are we good?” To my confusion, he tipped his head back, his gaze going to the sky. “What time is it?”

“Nearly midnight,” she said in a hiss of breath, “And nearly totality.” Her perfectly made up eyes narrowed. "Where's the apple?" 

My gaze went to the bar. She was right. The apple had disappeared. 

"Fuck." He hissed, "Ah, this isn't good."

Ren turned a shade of white I didn’t know existed, his eyes skating the horizon. I followed his gaze to the pitch black sky. It was a starless night, a half moon poking from the clouds. “Is everything okay?” I stood up, swaying slightly. Maybe it was the drinks I’d downed while talking to him, or social butterflies were contagious. 

Ren scoffed, pinching the skin between his brow. 

“Oh, man. Don’t even ask.” 

“Dude!” The girl hit him with a scowl, though from the look in her eyes it was teasing. 

“Can’t we just... stay here?” Leaning against the bar, Ren groaned, and I noticed his expression relax once more. “We’ve got like five minutes.”

The girl shot him dagger eyes, before her gaze flicked to me. “He’s got a thing. I mean, we have a thing. And this, uh, this thing, it’s important.”

“Uh, no.” Ren crossed his arms. “We don’t have a thing, Luce.”

The girl, or Luce, rolled her eyes. “Right. My mistake. He has a thing which isn’t with me.”

 “You really have a way with words.”

“And you’re three and a half minutes away from being screwed.” Luce glanced at a fancy watch on her arm. “Wait, no. Two and a half minutes.”

“You don’t have to count down.”

“I told you this was a bad idea,” she gritted out. “But nobody ever listens to me. I said no parties.”

“Relax! We’re going! Who are you, my mom?”

The two of them were sounding more and more confusing the more the conversation went on. I noticed something poking from her Louis Vuitton. bag. Another red apple. 

So, these guys really liked their apples. 

In the end, Luce dragged him away. 

I followed, uncertainly, stumbling over myself. 

“Are you guys good?” I had to shout over the music. I shoved past party goers, suddenly mesmerised in Ren and Luce’s business. 

“Yeah!” Ren nodded, but he kept nodding, like nodding would make everything better. He seemed fidgety and paranoid, suddenly, his gaze snapping from the sky, to the pool— and back again. Luce pulled him back into the crowd, the two of them blending in with dancing bodies. 

“It was nice meeting you!” He shouted, yelping, when Luce yanked him. “Mina, right?”

“Yeah!” I was about to ask for his number, but he’d gone, the two of them swallowed into the dark. When I was left standing on the edge of the pool, my eyes found the sky once more, slivers of white light bathing the clouds as a full moon slipped into view. I found myself transfixed by the sight, before warm arms wrapped around me, beer breath tickling my ear in a curled slur. "What’s the number for Chinese takeout again?” 

Calliope, whispering sweet nothings into my ear. 

I spent an hour that night in my bathroom, rubbing my best friend’s back as she heaved up everything she’d eaten mixed with a cocktail of vodka and beer. I let her crash on the couch and jumped into my own bed with a spinning head. I don’t remember sleeping, only waking up at 10am to sunlight pouring through my windows, and the smell of pancakes.

Calliope was a good cook, especially when she was hungover. I scarfed down pancakes and headed to work. I’d only gotten maybe two feet out of the door before a Starbucks latte was shoved into my face. And behind that latte, was a dishevelled looking Ren. He was still in the same clothes, crumpled and torn at the bottom, a checker  jacket slung over his shoulder. This time his ray-bans covered what I had to guess were bloodshot eyes from either drugs or drink— or both. “Morning!” He said cheerfully, running a free hand through his hair. I noticed he wasn’t alone, two figures standing close by. 

I recognised Luce’s hair, though the other person was a mystery. Hesitantly, I took the coffee with a smile. It was still warm. “You know where I live?”

“Hm? Oh, yeah. You told me last night.”

I was pretty sure I didn’t. 

Maybe I did? The night was kind of a blur. 

Early morning coffee became the norm. 

Ren brought me coffee every morning, and that turned into a date where both of us were too awkward to speak, a second and third date where we got closer— and before I knew it I was spending the night at his apartment. I was introduced to his two friends. Luce, who I already sort of knew, and Johnny, the mystery guy. Looks wise, he was the opposite of Ren. Short and stocky. While Ren’s attributes were a sharp jawline, Johnny had a baby face, freckles dotting his cheeks and a liking for baggy clothes. 

The three of them had a friendship, or a connection, I guess, that I didn’t really understand. They didn’t fit as a friend group. At least that's what I thought initially. Ren was the extrovert, always loud and joking around, while Johnny spent his time on his phone or listening to music, hiding under his hood. Luce was a mixture of the two. Sometimes she was loud and overly passionate, especially about musical soundtracks, but she also seemed like a dreamer, often caught in her own thoughts. 

The three of them were a good distraction from my usual dilemma: Smells. Though as I got to know them, I realised there was something strange about them. I noticed Ren’s room was weirdly empty, and his luggage was always packed in the back of his closet like he was ready to go somewhere. But he never did. 

I figured it was because he was travelling for work, but he never used it. Things started getting really weird a few weeks back. We went to a party, some fancy influencer party Johnny had been invited to, and it was pretty fun. I drank and talked to people, just the usual party crap. I didn’t think anything was out of the ordinary until I walked in on Ren closing the blinds, Johnny holding duck tape, and Luce sticking tape over the windows. I’d heard their hissed whispers, domineered by Luce, her voice muffled with the roll of duct tape in her mouth. "What exactly do we do when someone walks in?" 

Ren jumped on the counter and reached out, pulling the blinds closed. “They’re all probably too high to realise. It’s just for a few hours.”

“Because you insisted it would rain.” Johnny, from his place sitting on the counter, his feet dangling, said with a sardonic smile. He grabbed an apple from a gold plated fruit bowl and took a bite. “And look," He said through a mouthful, "Clear skies, and we’re stuck until sunrise.”

Johnny slipped on his ray-bans. “Fuck, they’re really trying hard tonight. The bastard is strong.”

I backed away before they noticed me.

Instances like that kept happening, and I started to wonder if they were scared of the moon. 

It made sense. They made excuses when I suggested going out on a moonlit night, and Ren always closed the blinds, the windows, and kept silverware, including mirrors and anything with a reflective surface locked away in a cabinet. 

When I questioned him, he said it had all been passed down from a grandparent. But I’d seen a Target price on the mirror, and the silver wear definitely wasn’t rusty enough to be that old. 

Though things got weirder. 

As weeks stretched on, I started to smell—- 

Burning. 

I woke up in the middle of the night, to the stink of smoke choking the back of my throat. But there was no smoke. There was no flame— only the suffocating stink bleeding into my mind. It was just like the rotten oranges, and the smell of gas. It was him. It was all over him, blanketing his body and mind, an ignition taking over him.

Ren was burning. 

It wasn’t the usual smell of burning. Not what I was used to. The smell suffocated me until I couldn't breathe, raw and slicing. I sensed flesh bubbling and torn from bone, hair singeing from a blackened scalp. I felt it all, the overbearing heat prickle my skin, a silent scream ripping from my mouth. 

No, not my mouth. 

His. 

It’s like I could sense him, imagine his body caught in an ignition of orange, flailing arms and clothes slowly catching light in endless fire. 

The burning didn’t stop. It didn’t falter. 

It kept going, scorching him from the inside. 

Ren, though, was fast asleep. 

He couldn’t smell the smoke. 

Or see the phantom flames. 

I got out of bed and found the bathroom, dousing myself in cold water. My hands were trembling. 

I waited for him to die— but he didn’t. 

When I went back to the bedroom, he wasn’t in bed. Ren was sitting cross legged in front of the wall. His eyes were open, but unseeing, as he scratched into the paintwork, his nails dripping red with the force of each stroke. I couldn’t move, only watched as he sketched out a very rough drawing of a tree. It was beautiful; a large tree with strange symbols carved into its base. I only recognised what looked like a snake, which he finished with, digging his bloody nails in further. When I was finally able to force my limbs into some kind of submission, I took slow steps towards him, and found myself staring into pooling black. His eyes, they weren’t his eyes. 

His expression twitched erratically, lips moving in a soundless language I didn’t understand. 

Ren saw the carving the morning after, I know he did. 

But he ignored it, painting over the scratching. (I did manage to get a photo, I'll try and upload it) 

The next day, Luce showed up at the door. 

Johnny was behind her, shouldering a backpack, and I caught the scent automatically, hitting me like ice water. Burning. They were burning too. I could see it, twisting orange and red writhing up and down Luce’s squirming legs, her endless scream harmonising with a monstrous wail.

Luce said three words in a sharp shriek. 

“They’ve found us.”

They left me without saying a word. 

But I can still smell them. 

Five days have passed, and they’re not back yet. The smell is still there, still lingering in a thick fog. It's not just the smell, I can feel something– something deep inside me telling me that he's going to burn. Every day feels like I'm living in a dream, my thoughts tangled and cloudy. 

Yesterday, I screamed until my chest felt like it was collapsing, blood tainting my nose and lips and running fresh and hot down my chin. It came out of nowhere, a wail that I can still feel twisted inside me, locked into my throat. Every time I open my mouth I'm afraid it will come out. 

I'm afraid I'll scream until I'm hollow, until I've lost all my breath. 

I’ve tried calling, but their phones are dead. 

I keep thinking… I mean, I’ve gone over it again and again in my head. They’re supposed to die. 

So, why… Why does it feel different for them? 

Why does it feel like they’re going to burn in an entirely different way? 

And whatever it is… I can’t stop it. 

Like Mrs Weller, my mom, and Caleb. 

I can’t stop it.

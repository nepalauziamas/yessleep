I stepped out of the shower, quickly drying off and walking toward the front door. 

I opened it a smidge and looked out toward the street corner where the police car was sitting, wanting their help. But I couldn’t exactly walk out naked. And truth be told I wasn’t counting on them to do much given how they had responded before. If this turned out to just be my mind playing tricks on me, I didn’t want to cause more trouble and wind up without a place to stay. 

Instead, I grabbed another knife from the kitchen and gingerly crept toward the hallway, peering into the closet cautiously. But I couldn’t see anything. Whatever had grabbed the doll, it was gone. But I could see something just beyond the clothes. A dark opening into some kind of tunnel between the duplex. 

Quickly I went to the bedroom and grabbed some shorts and a shirt. I didn’t want whatever had taken it to disappear. It was time to get to the bottom of this, I thought as I went back to the kitchen and grabbed Macie’s phone. I didn’t want to be without a means of communication. 


Then, using the light from the phone; I stepped into the closet and looked into the strange dark space between our home and the neighbors. 

Sarah had said that this building was once a single residence. Had she been telling the truth? 

I stepped into the darkness, trying to get a good feel of my surroundings as I saw what looked like a similar door lingering open that led into the neighbors closet. 

He was probably sleeping right now, I realized as I checked the time.  I thought of the strange story Sarah had told me before she attacked. 
What if it was true?

Was he the one behind all of this, turning people into dolls? It sounded like some kind of black magic that I didn’t want to mess with. 

But now Macie was missing, and I knew the truth had to be somewhere inside. So, inside I went. 

As I stepped into his bedroom I dimmed my flash just a smidge on my phone and listened to his snoring. He was napping on the opposite side of a king size bed, unaware of my presence or doing a damn good job of faking it. 

Still, it didn’t look like he had been awake anytime recently. So if he hadn’t moved the doll… who did?

I took a step out onto his carpet, pushing the closet door a little further to make sure it stayed open. 

Instead it immediately slammed close and I heard the neighbor make a soft snort in his rest. I cussed to myself as I tried to open it back but the door wouldn’t budge. 

Fuck. 

Nervously I moved across the carpet to his bedroom door, keeping the knife ready just in case he woke up and attacked. I had no idea what this man was capable of. 

He seemed to be a bit restless, but ultimately undisturbed by the noise. I opened his bedroom door and stepped out into the dark hallway, second guessing even being here. This isn’t safe. This is the beginning of a fucking horror movie, I thought. 

No Trish, you’re in the middle of one already I realized as I looked toward his guest room. There was a light on. 

I reached for the handle and jiggled it a little but the door wouldn’t budge. 

There must be a key, I thought as I walked toward his den. But it was so pitch black, because of his curtains that I couldn’t see anything. I adjusted my brightness again and slowly moved my phone across the room, looking for anything shiny in the shadows. 

I found it. The fucking doll. 

Not Sarah, but the original, the one she had said was a replica of his wife. Her lifeless eyes stared at me across the room as I saw the doll just in a rigid position against the television. 

Was this one alive too? I thought to myself as I kept the knife in a defensive position and kept looking. My heart felt like it was about to burst out of my chest. There were no keys anywhere and I was considering racing out his front door. 

No. Macie. I have to find her, I thought. 

Then her phone rang. Loud, obnoxious and definitely enough to wake the neighbor. It was her dad again. I answered it to stop the ringing just as the bedroom light switched on. 

Hide, I thought frantically as I scrambled to his bathroom. 

I climbed into the shower and pulled the heavy curtain, getting down on the floor and laying perfectly still. I heard him walking up as Macie’s dad tried to talk on the phone. “Trish? You there?” 

I kept him on mute and turned the volume low as the neighbor stepped into the bathroom, yawning to himself. 

Shit shit shit shit shit. 
I kept the knife right against me as I waited and anticipated being assaulted. 

Instead I heard the neighbor drop his shorts and listened to him piss, completely unaware of my presence. Chuck was still trying to talk though, and I was certain he was going to hear. 

“You need to answer me!” he snapped. 

The neighbor froze as he finished using the toilet, his silhouette right over the tub. 
“Andrea…? Is that you?”

He shuffled his feet to the den and I kept still, letting Macie’s dad hang up as I listened. 

I heard the neighbor say something else and then heard the bedroom door shut. 

Fuck this shit I need to leave I thought as I stood up and peered out slowly. The coast seemed clear. 

Macie’s dad was calling again but this time thankfully the volume was down. 

“Chuck, now is not a good time,” I answered with a whisper as I clenched the phone next to my ear. I couldn’t exactly stumble in the darkness to the front door. 

“I’m sorry, it’s just that I was just thinking to check online and locate your phone. You remember how we installed that feature for y’all before the move? Anyway, are you sure Macie isn’t there?” he asked. 

I stepped into the den, listening for any hint that the neighbor was still awake. 

“What? No. What are you talking about. I told you I haven’t seen her since this morning,” I replied. 

“Well the phone is there somewhere, it says it’s still in the house,” Chuck answered. 

I froze, looking toward the long hallway. Toward the guest room with the light on. 

“Chuck, can you call my phone?” I asked. 

“Sure, let me do a three-way call,” he responded. 

I waited. Then, from the other side of the guest room door; I heard it ring. 

I hung up on Chuck just as the hallway light flicked on and I saw the neighbor standing there. 

Immediately I ran. I don’t know what I stumbled over but I pulled open his front door and ran straight to the cop car down the street. 

“Help! You have to help me!!” I screamed as the officers got out of their car. 

“What’s going on?” they asked, both cautious to be near me as I waved the knife I was holding frantically toward the duplex. 

“My partner. He’s got my partner in there! Fucking hell, he’s holding her captive!” I shouted frantically. 
Both of them pulled their weapons and moved toward the entrance to my neighbor’s house. I stood at the edge of the street, pacing and trying to stay calm. This would all be over soon I told myself. 

I should have known better. 

Three minutes later the officers reappeared, no longer in a defensive stance. Both of them looked tired and frustrated. 

“Ma’am, please come inside the building,” they ordered. 

“Did you find her? Is she here?” I asked, my eyes darting about the room. The doll was still right next to the TV where I had seen it. And the neighbor was standing there in pajamas, looking every bit like the victim here. 

“Ma’am I’m going to need you to explain what it is you were doing in your neighbor’s side of the duplex,” the second officer said. 

My mouth felt dry. 
“I fucking told you. My partner is here. In that very room. He took her and has been holding her here against her will!” I shouted. 

The neighbor went over to the room and unlocked it, letting us all peer inside. 

It was decorated as a little girl’s room, with pink unicorns and tea party equipment. Stuffed animals on a bed. And on that bed as well, Macie’s phone. 

“I was planning to return this to you tonight when I woke up. I found it outside in the yard,” he growled. 

“What? No. That can’t be right. This isn’t right. Why the fuck is this room locked?!” I snapped. 

“Ma’am we need you to calm down,” the first officer said as he reached for his taser. 

“Calm down? My fucking partner is missing and this maniac is hiding her here somewhere. I bet there’s a secret closet somewhere here too huh! Where you hide all your damn sex dolls!!” 

“Ma’am, That’s enough! You’re lucky that Mister Langford here isn’t filing any charges. As far as we can tell here, you’re the one that broke in and you’re the one wielding a dangerous weapon. Now I don’t know what kind of issues you are having but if we get a call from this residence again, someone will be leaving here in the back of our patrol car. Is that understood?” the second man growled. 

All I could was nod and try to not shake. They muttered apologies to the neighbor and then escorted me out. 

I stood there in my own side of the duplex, watching as they left for the night. Realizing I was alone again to deal with this nightmare. 

Back inside our own place, I put my phone down and slumped into the sofa. Was I losing my fucking mind?

I know what I saw, I thought to myself as I replayed the conversation over and over again with Sarah. 

Then, a slip of paper slid under my front door. 

I walked over to the peephole, trying to see who had left it. 

Then reached down and unfolded the note. 

It was the neighbor. 

“Meet me at my place if you want answers-Bill”

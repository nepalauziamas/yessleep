I won’t be mincing words. I believe my family is gone.

I know it, you know it. We all fucking know that they have got to be dead. 

But that doesn’t mean whatever the hell this thing is that took them is going to win. 

It’s been nearly five days now.[I lost my family over the weekend](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/nfcao4/my_wife_and_kids_wont_come_up_from_the_basement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) and now I see that this house has a force of evil that I wasn’t prepared for. 

That I don’t think anyone was prepared for. 

But I’m going to keep fighting. My family deserves that. 

After my experience with [Audrey](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ng7jl3/my_wife_and_kids_wont_come_up_from_the_basement/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I decided to try to get the police again. A woman had just been brutally killed in our house and she had fed their corpse to the basement. I figured if that didn’t pique their interest the sheer amount of blood on the property would. 

I recognized that the entity I’m battling doesn’t want me to seek outside help, so I probably should have anticipated that my phone wouldn’t work on the property. Instead I drove down to the police station to provide a statement. I had no idea what sort of tricks the entity would play while I was gone, but I also felt so relieved to get out. 

Guiltily, part of me wanted to keep driving. But no, Audrey and the kids need me to finish this. 

I didn’t tell them the full story but just enough to convince them that an accident had occurred at my new house and they needed to come investigate. 

One officer said something interesting just as we were about to leave. 

“What was the address again?” he muttered. I told him. 

“Huh… wasn’t that the place they found that kid a few years back Tommy?” 

“What kid?” his partner asked as we walked out of the station. 

“Can’t remember. The husband was an abuser and had kept the kid locked up in the basement for years though. Then afterward the wife went insane and killed the son and the daughter. It was crazy,” he said. 

“I remember that now,” the other officer said and then the rest of the ride became weirdly quiet. 


I tucked that little bit of info away into my brain as we drove to my house and I prepared for whatever fuckery the house was going to throw at me next. Something told me that this man and his family had not made it out of this house alive. And I didn’t want to be next. 

Honestly I thought that I was prepared for anything by this point. But the house proved me wrong again. 

As we got inside I directed them to the kitchen, only to find it was completely clean from top to bottom. Not a speck of blood anywhere or any body tissue. 

“Is this some kind of sick joke son?” the second officer asked as he came back from checking the rest of the house. 

“No… it’s true. Here let me get you the real estate agent’s business card,” I stammered as I fumbled through my wallet. 

“What’s in the basement?” The other asked, looking down at the closed door. 

“I… I don’t really know,” I admitted. 

“You got the key?” He asked. 

“It isn’t locked,” I said. 

“Well then, lead the way,” the second officer told me. 

I froze. I couldn’t think of a good excuse to not go down into the basement but every bone in my body told me something horrible would await us. 

“I would really rather not,” I said nervously. Then one officer sighed and pushed me down, muttering he didn’t have time for this nonsense. They both flanked me to prevent me from going back upstairs and I reached for the door, hoping to god that it was locked. 

It opened with a slow creaking sound and I gestured toward the darkness. “I don’t believe there’s any electricity down here,” I admitted. 

“Where exactly is your family sir?” One officer asked as they took out their smartphone to shine a light down the basement stairs. 

I could just barely make out a brick wall, it was that dark. 

“They aren’t here. Wife took my kids to visit mom upstate, for the week,” I lied. I really don’t know why. I knew it was a mistake the moment I did but it was too late. 

“Daddy…?” a voice whispered down below and I closed my eyes and prayed the officers didn’t hear it. 

Of course they did. 

“What was that?” 

Before I knew what was happening the two men were taking me down the stairs to the edge of the basement. We couldn’t see anything down there. Even the light was hardly penetrating the shadows. 

But then amid the gloom we saw my little girl, standing amid a pile of what looked like human waste. 

And I suddenly realized she was shackled to the wall. 

“Holy shit,” one officer exclaimed, running toward her. 

“No:.. it isn’t safe!” I shouted. 

“Get back against the wall,” the second officer snarled, pushing me away even as his partner knelt to check Callie for injuries. I could see her mouth was still dripping with blood. 

“That’s what I was trying to tell you, they attacked that woman,” I insisted but the two cops were no longer listening to me. 

“Are you okay sweetie?” the officer asked. 

“That isn’t my daughter!!” I said frantically. 

“You better shut up before I make you regret anything else,” the second cop snarled. 

“Daddy I’m scared,” Callie said as she cried softly. 

It sounded so much like my little girl. I wanted to believe. 

“Leave her alone!!” a scream came from the darkness. The officer that was helping Callie jumped in surprise, turning to see faux Audrey standing there in the gloomy basement. There was hardly enough lighting to make out her face but I could tell that portions of her skin were beginning to peel away around her nose and eyes. Beneath it her skin looked like porcelain, new and young and different. Almost the way an insect might break out of a husk. 

“They aren’t ready,” faux Audrey said as she stepped closer. I recognized now my initial guess was right, she looked like a new person, with dark red hair and paler skin. Not the woman I had married at all. Not even close. 

“Ma’am we are going to need to question you and your husband,” the officer said sternly. 

“He’s not my husband,” she said, confirming my fears. The house had changed her… but into what? 

Before the officer had a chance to move, the stranger said, “These aren’t my children either… not yet.” 

“What is going on here?” the other officer asked. 

“I don’t really care, all of you are going to come down to the station and clear this up immediately,” the first man insisted. 

“No. You can’t take them. The house needs them,” she snarled, blocking the stairway. 

“Lady,  if you don’t move right now I will tase you,” the second officer snapped. I watched as the stranger eyes turned completely black and then the entire house rumbled again. 

“What the hell….” the cop said, looking down at his feet. I watched in shock and horror as his legs became bolted to the floor, transforming into wood. He struggled to move as the strange shapeshifting magic moved up his body and he started to scream in terror as it covered his body. 

Before he had a chance, he was as stiff as stone, immobile. 

The second man was no different, frantically running up the stairs only to have them act quicksand and begin to swallow him alive. He turned and tried to shoot the stranger, but it didn’t do any good. Whatever had emerged from my wife’s body was unfazed by the attack. 

As soon as he was gone, she turned her attention to Callie and smiled in the most sinister way. 

“Nothing will prevent our return. Our survival,” she whispered. 

“Daddy… I want to go. Please help me…” she whimpered. 

I looked at the tears in her eyes and then looked toward the stranger, mortified as I realized that I was wrong about all of my family being gone. 

“Callie… daddy’s going to save you. I promise,” I said, reaching for her hand. 

“She belongs to the house now, John. Audrey tried to tell you. But you wouldn’t listen,” the woman hissed as she blocked my path to my daughter. 

“And you just took two men’s lives. How the fuck are you going to explain that one away? This house will be torched to the ground once locals know it’s haunted,” I snapped back, my voice shaking in fear and anger. 

“The house will keep them away. It has already grown stronger. Soon, it will be able to make things right,” she whispered in a reverential way. 

“I want my family back. They didn’t hurt you,” I told the demon. Her eyes blazed with fire. 

“But the family before you did. A price must be paid! We will walk this earth again, and you will help us… or you will never save the ones you love,” the stranger told me.

I realized in its own cold calculating way, the demon that had taken my wife hostage and formed her body to suit its needs was now offering me a choice. 

I could harvest souls for it, to save my children. 

“Where is Adrian… show me my son before I make any deal,” I said. 

She stepped aside and in the darkness I saw his weak frail body. He was hardly conscious, a thick layer of some kind of strange plaster was covering his skin and he was struggling to breathe. 

Seeing him there made me want to scream. To cry. To kill this monster. 

But I knew I couldn’t if I wanted to even get a chance to save my kids. 

“I’ll do it…” I whispered as my lips trembled. 

“I’ll gather the souls you need. But you have to let my children go.”

  

I’ve just received an email that I’d really rather not open.

Because if it is what I think it is - then it raises some serious questions - about everything.

I might as well admit it, I'm sitting here feeling pretty damn scared, and  yet curious at the same time – that old, uncomfortable combination. And there’s another emotion, too ...

I'm wondering what the hell to do.

I’ll give the main facts up to now, and I’ll try not to drag it out too much, and then maybe someone on here can advise me …

It all began with that damn fool writing group. I mean, the counselling or support or whatever you want to call it, that goes around recommending writing therapy to people. People that are supposed to be in need of such a thing. People like Cody. And, to a lesser extent, me. 

Do you really want me to go into the background of it all? Let me just summarize by saying that we were a classic pair of troubled teens, from broken, unloving (etc, etc) homes. Our stories were no different from a hundred thousand others. And we didn’t want to attend counselling. But finally, more out of curiosity than anything else, we did.

To everyone’s surprise Cody rather took to the writing suggestion when it came up. Honestly you wouldn’t have thought it to look at him. Nothing bookish about him at all, never had been. But then - to use the most apposite saying in this case – you shouldn’t judge a book by its cover. To tell the truth, I would have thought that writing would be the last thing on earth he would ever want to be involved in. He was too good-looking for one thing. Not that I mean writers can’t be good-looking of course. But anyway, I’m drifting off the point. Evidently there was something that had long been hidden in him, a vein of creativity that took off at the slightest encouragement. 

At first, I ribbed him a little about the dangers of ending up as a cringey poet or something. But poetry wasn’t his thing. Nor journalling either. Instead the damned group set him afire with the idea of writing stories. Actual stories. And admittedly there was enough material in his life already to set him up. Family dysfunction, substance abuse, high-school dropout, girlfriend troubles, even a magnificent road accident. Even though we trod similar paths his life had already been crammed with far more significant incident than mine. Whoever heard of a writer with the first name Cody, though? I sure as hell hadn’t. No doubt I’m being too judgmental again but it didn’t seem a literary name to me at all. Maybe he could set a precedent.

As for me, I would be his agent. I wasn’t bitten by the literary bug myself, as such. I just wanted to get involved on the mercenary side of things. 

(Yet here *I* am telling this story – *his* story, mainly; I’m not sure what the end of it is for myself.)

The long and short of it is, I encouraged him to write when no one else did. The writing group fever might have worn off soon enough otherwise, but it was I who kept egging him on. 

But before he really got down to it, he said, he had to find even more material. More incident, ever more vivid, dramatic, and finally, terrible. At least that’s what he believed, but I was of the private opinion that he was in danger of becoming a flat-out bore. 

Now, looking back I shouldn’t’ve kept that opinion private. I should’ve been a true friend and told him straight up he was being very cliched. And then maybe I could’ve prevented what followed. Or maybe that’s attributing too much to the whole writing thing, but it *did* play a part, by his own frank admission to me. 

Not long after the counselling sessions, Cody embarked upon a totally wild career. Fights/injuries, a deliberate smash-up this time, and dedicated drug-dealing, not just taking. And only I understood why he was doing these things. Collecting more writing material, to make a sensational novel. Everyone else said, or at least intimated, that it was just the predictable result of his upbringing. I did try to get him to tone things down a bit, but evidently I didn’t try nearly hard enough. I blame myself now for that of course. Before he got *too* out of control, though, some prison time intervened, as the courts did not look sympathetically on his writing alibi.  

He didn’t seem to mind prison at all, in fact he welcomed it as it gave him the chance to get on with his writing. And of course prison life itself furnished him with more material. The best thing, when he came to write it all properly, would be that all this colourful stuff would have the ring of absolute authenticity. He had literally lived all this shit. There would be genuine conviction in every word. 

And yet, you know, he still wasn’t quite satisfied. 

‘I want to write something original,’ he confided to me seriously on one of my visits. 

To be honest, that would be quite an agreeable turn for his literary career to take, and I said so, as tactfully as possible. He shook his head.

‘I don’t mean just – *unusual,* or offbeat, or anything. That’s what you’re thinking, right?’

I shrugged. ‘Well –‘

There was a faraway look in his eyes. ‘I mean – something *really* original. Something that literally no one has ever written before. Not ever.’

‘Well, that’s probably impossible,’ I pointed out. ‘There’s nothing new under the sun. Didn’t someone say that over 2000 years ago? And that probably holds truer for literature than anything else,’ I added, rather caustically.

He looked at me with his piercing dark eyes, and grinned suddenly. ‘You know Josh, you're the only one who ever really encouraged me to write.' I *did* know, too well. 'You’ll be the first to get my manuscript when it’s done.’

It sounded less of a promise than a threat, I thought, although no doubt he meant it kindly, in the spirit of our old friendship. 

‘Well, thanks,’ I said, trying to make it sound enthusiastic.

‘You’ll see – when I get it all into shape.’ 

I wondered how many more years that would take, but didn’t say it aloud. Instead, I smiled back. ‘Sure. Look forward to it.’ I added jokingly, ‘Surprise me.’

I was 13 at the time, very excited for my new babysitting capabilities!

I went to Red Cross for certification and everything! I asked my dad to help me build a website, and advertisement in my area. 

He had the brilliant idea that we could make magnets with my information! Parents could stick them on the fridge, and reference it when they need a night off! 

This was in the relatively early days of the internet, so finding a babysitter online was pretty out of the question. A good ol' walk around the neighborhood would get kids a job for the summer.

That's exactly what I did. I was so happy putting a flyer, magnet attached, to all my neighbors front doors.

&#x200B;

I only got a few responses, but hey, i was babysitting kids every weekend, so i was making pretty good money.

&#x200B;

My most frequent customer was Shelly, she had a 4 year old daughter named Katrina "Kat" for short. Shelly lived directly across from my house to the left. She constantly asked me to babysit, even some week nights. 

It was summer, so my parents didn't really care. She would push the boundaries of how late i could stay all of the time. She had me babysit until 5AM once when she was supposed to be home no later than 9PM.

To be fair, she did always call me to let me know she was "running late" I just never knew how late she would be.

&#x200B;

She would sometimes bring this creep, Josh around. 

I hated Josh... He would always run his hands up and down my back, and ask me weird questions like "Have you had your first kiss yet? You do gymnastics right? You wanna show me how bendy you can be?"

He brought me several different food and drink items (like McDonalds, or Slurpees) to "thank" me for being so accommodating to their schedule. 

&#x200B;

The thing that weirded me out about him the most was how uncomfortable Shelly looked around him. I kinda figured this was her boyfriend, or at least a friend... Why does she seem to hate him? 

He would tell me "Sorry, Shelly had an appointment she just couldn't miss" as her eyes would dart around the room, gripping her cigarette box.

&#x200B;

I told my parents about the whole thing, and they encouraged me to keep babysitting. 

They really didn't see it as much of a problem, because he wasn't around much, and even when he was, it was for passing moments when i got there, or when i was leaving.

My Mother did throw out a few colorful comments about how she firmly believed Shelly was a sex worker, and Josh was her "pimp".

&#x200B;

I really liked the little girl, Kat. I assistant taught gymnastics to the toddlers at my studio, which i shared with Kat as well, and i would have hours of fun teaching her tricks. 

You could see the excitement light up in her eyes every time she nailed a hard move. It was great getting to watch her love for the sport grow. 

I was getting to share my passion and make someone else very happy in the process. When she got tired, we would do crafts or watch a movie. 

Then she would go to bed and i would stay up reading. It was a lot of fun every time. Hardly any downsides. 

&#x200B;

One night, i had just put Kat to bed, around 9. It's a little late, i know, but her mom wasn't strict with a bedtime, and just asked she was asleep before 12AM.

I was in the kitchen making myself a snack, suddenly heard the front doorknob have a key inserted into it, and turn. I was startled because i wasn't expecting Shelly home for several more hours. 

I instantly felt like something was off and started walking backwards in the kitchen, staring at the hallway where the entrance is. 

&#x200B;

I see a teenage boy i don't know, come through the doorway. Behind him, is a group of other teenage boys. They are way bigger than me, clearly a few years older.

They boy in the doorway stretches a sick smile across his face and walks closer to me. The other teenagers are still standing in the yard, laughing and "ooo"ing 

&#x200B;

The pure fear that washed over me is immeasurable. I felt like my blood was boiling while my skin was frozen. I was so scared, but all i could really think about, was the sweet little helpless 4 year old 50 feet away.

The kitchen had two entry ways, the one behind me looped around into the living room, where i could cut to the hallway and get to Kat. 

I was hoping i could go in there, lock the door, possibly jump out the window with her, (we were on ground level) or if the locked door was enough, call the police. I just had to get there... I just have to get there.

&#x200B;

I turn and sprint as fast as i have ever ran in my life. Unfortunately, he was standing in the very same hall i was trying to dart down. All he had to do was wait for me. 

I was completely trapped... It didn't matter if I abandoned Kat or not, any way out of that house, or to Kat was in the direct path of this stranger.

&#x200B;

Honestly, i didn't even think of abandoning her though, i was on a war path to get to her first.

&#x200B;

The second i get near him, he reaches out his fist and hits me right above my left eye socket. I hit the ground hard and fast. Honestly, it didn't even register as painful. It didn't quite register at all for a moment. 

I gain a little clarity, and i can hear the roar happening outside of his friends laughing and cheering him on. 

I look up and see him taking off his spiked leather belt, giving me that same sadistic smile.

I expected the obvious. I finally started screaming. Not even words... just screaming. I tried to get up, but he kicked me back down, took his belt and hit me across the face. Hard. 

He straddled me, and just kept beating me. Just hitting me over and over again with the belt, and occasionally his fists. 

&#x200B;

I could still hear his friends... a very supportive group... 

&#x200B;

He finally stood up and just laughed over me. I wish i could say i was some badass that made an awesome recovery, but i just laid there crying.

He just... walked out the front door. Didn't even close it. His friends following behind as the walked down the street. 

&#x200B;

As soon as i gained the courage to move again, i shot up, slammed the front door closed and locked it. I ran into Kat's room, she was already sitting by the door crying.

I snatched her up and ran into the bathroom with her and locked the door. I realized her door had no lock, and had windows, which i saw as as a hazard at this point, so bathroom seemed like the safest option.

&#x200B;

I just sat in there holding on to Kat for dear life as we both cried for what felt like hours. 

I don't know why i didn't think of calling the police at this point. I think i was just so focused on feeling safe locked in the bathroom, i didn't want to leave for anything, and i didn't have a phone, landlines only.

I didn't want to walk to my parents house, because HE and his friends were outside, last i saw. HE also has a key though so... I just felt screwed all the way around. 

It's all kind of a blur at this point. I was so scared and roughed up i couldn't think straight. 

&#x200B;

Kat eventually fell asleep in my arms. I was sitting, back against the tub, exhausted as all hell. 

I heard the front door open again, and instantly burst into tears and yelled "Shelly?!" Kat woke up, and instantly started crying and ran to the bathroom door in anticipation of her mother.

&#x200B;

Thankfully it was indeed Shelly. She sprinted down the hall replying with a "Yeah? Whats wrong??" I got up, unlocked and opened the bathroom door, crying my eyes out. 

Shelly looked horrified as she greeted her inconsolable daughter. She swept up Kat on her hip, and instantly gave me all the attention. She put her hand on my face and said "Oh my God what happened?!" 

That was the first moment i actually looked in the mirror. I had two bruises across my face, one on my neck, and all over my arms.

&#x200B;

I was still crying as i told her some teenage boy had a key to her house and he broke in right after i put Kat to bed.

Her entire face changed to a vapid gaze. She looked empty, yet terrified. She could barley swallow.

She walked down the hall, grabbed a photo off the bookshelf and came back towards me.

She asked "Is this him" 

The boy in the picture looked a lot younger, probably about 12, holding Kat as a baby. He may have been younger... but that was most certainly him. 

I slowly looked back up at her and hesitated when i said ".... uh.... yes."

She threw up. Instantly. Just puke flew out of her mouth on to the wall and she collapses down. 

She quickly broke into tears and just kept saying "I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... I'm sorry" 

&#x200B;

I was still confused, but she obviously knows who this guy is. I asked her "Who is he?"

&#x200B;

She told me it was her 16 year old son named, Kayden. She hardly had anything to do with him, as his dad has full custody. She told me his dad was very abusive towards her, and she was always so worried Kayden would turn out the same way.

She begged me not to call the cops. Told me it would never happen again. I was 13, naive and traumatized and i listened to her.

&#x200B;

She walked me across the street to my door and said sorry many more times and wished me a speedy recovery. 

&#x200B;

I instantly went to my dad crying and battered. My mom woke up and rushed to check on the situation. I told them everything and showed them all of my bruises. I had them on my legs and torso too. 

They... did nothing. They just told me I'm not allowed to babysit for Shelly anymore... Like that was even an option... None of the adults in the situation told the police, and actively discouraged me from telling anyone else.

&#x200B;

A few days later Shelly came to my front door with Kayden. She said she was making him say sorry, but he wouldn't say it in person, so he wrote me a note. 

He didn't even make eye contact with me, just held out a crumpled piece of paper for me to take.

I don't remember what the note said anymore, but i remember it being riddled with spelling mistakes and bad grammar.

&#x200B;

This whole situation was bad... Shelly consistently brought a grown man over who gave me the creeps, then, turns out, someone i hadn't even met from her life attacked me, and no adults were helping me.

&#x200B;

I hated knowing Kayden could pop up a few doors down from me at any moment if his mom had him for a visit. 

&#x200B;

Years went by and honestly i hadn't thought about him in forever. I was 17 at this point. I went to my local grocery store to pick up a few things and this guy decides to approach me.

He tells me i'm really cute and should give him my number.

I... was... shocked.

"Kayden." I said. It was all i could muster. I wanted him to know i knew who he was, but couldn't think of anything to say.

&#x200B;

He looked confused and said "Yeah? Sorry, did we go to school together or something?"

&#x200B;

I looked at him dead in the eyes and said "No. I babysat your little sister."

&#x200B;

He smiled for a second and then his whole face dropped as he realized who i was. 

He said "oh" and right as he took a step back this couple behind him said "Kayden, who is this?" with a sweet smile. I recognized them. they were Kat, and i guess, Kayden's grandparents. 

&#x200B;

He quickly said "no one" and the lady looked at me a little more intently and said "Ohhh! You were Kat's babysitter, huh? you live down the street from Shelly! Hiya honey, how have you been?!" 

I said "I'm fine, thank you. Kayden was just trying to get my number here." 

The lady giggled and said "Oh, we better not interrupt!" as she playfully smacked her husbands shoulder and they started backing away. 

&#x200B;

Kayden was awkwardly standing there, doing everything but looking in my direction. i took a step closer to him and said "I hope your life is fucking hell" and walked away.

I wish i had some sort of badass line to throw out, or some sort of perfect revenge, but i didn't. That was the best i could do. 

The moment i was out of the isle, out of sight, i ditched my cart and got out of the store as soon as i could.

I got in my car, drove to the street over, parked and had a full blown panic attack.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kayden, lets not meet again.

&#x200B;

I hope you life is fucking hell.

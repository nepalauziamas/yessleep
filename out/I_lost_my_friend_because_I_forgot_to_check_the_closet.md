I live in a little town in Illinois I’ve lived there my whole life, nothing strange has ever happened there. Well until recently at least let me explain our death rates have went up it is strange to say the least. My mom has been overprotective she has been making sure I go home right after school No sports and No party’s just to make sure I’m not “hanging around the wrong crowd” which I’ve never really played any sports or grown up with any close friends just friendships that would last a month or two then die out.

but recently I did meet somebody named Xavier he came over a  lot and when I say a lot I mean a lot like every other weekend because our mothers knew each other and we got along you know dream friendship and all that good shit. 

But the last couple of weekends had  felt off nothing extraordinary weird had happened but me and Xavier knew that something felt weird we both described the feeling like we were being watched it does not feel like that until around 2 or 3 am in the morning our moms did not want us staying up that late but we were little kids when did we listen our parents this particular night I wish we would have listened to them. 

A couple of weekends before it happened we were up at like 2:30 when I heard a noise in the closet I thought it was for sure Xavier, so I got up and creeped over to his bed which was on the opposite side of the room near the closet. When I got over there Xavier was laying there asleep….so I slowly turned to the closet step by step my heart raced more and more I was about to put my hand on the doorknob when I heard shuffling in Xavier’s bed I snapped my head around then saw him sitting up in his bed I looked at him and said, “What the fuck are you doing you scared the shit out of me.” He laughed at me and said, “I got to go take a piss why?” So I nodded and left the room by that time I had completely forgotten about the closet which was a mistake now that I look back on it. 

The rest of the night continued as normal he came back from the bathroom and he went to bed. A couple of  weekends later he came over again I was really looking forward to it because he was bringing over his Xbox and we had it planned that we were going to stay up all night playing Call of duty or Minecraft we started playing Call of duty around 12:00 we played that for about and hour or two before the got bored for whatever reason we decided it was best if we got sleep, so we went to sleep and around two or three I heard the same noise I had heard a couple of weekends ago it still haunts me till this day three years later, the noise sounded as if someone was moving in my closet and accidentally bumps into the door for whatever reason I had decided not to check it out so I went back to bed and around two or three minutes later I heard my closet door slowly creek open.  

I hate to say it but I completely froze up I heard the steps of whatever the hell it was going towards Xavier’s bed I slowly turned my head to see what it was it was, it was something l could not fully comprehend, I was simply not seeing anything I was just seeing a shadow. By this time I thought my mind was playing tricks on me but then I heard muffled screams and struggling coming from Xavier’s bed I tried to get up but I was frozen in my bed. 

I’ve never been so scared in my whole life then when I saw Xavier’s lifeless body being dragged right to my closet the shadow opened the door and quietly closed it. After what felt like hours of being completely in shock my eyed slowly closed and went to sleep I don’t know how I feel asleep after witnessing this but I did. 

After about two hours it was five am it was one of those weird feelings where you know you are awake but your eyes are still closed I was petrified to open my eyes I had to have been at least 10 minutes before I built up the courage to open my eyes when I finally did I saw very clearly a body that look exactly like Xavier’s I panicked grabbed my phone and turned on my phones flashlight and saw a his body Xavier’s body.

Not standing but hanging with a carved out smile like the fucking joker with something written on his stomach it still sends chills down my back writing it today it read “Don’t check the closet with a deformed smiley face on it, I instantly went into fight or flight mode and sprinted downstairs and told my mom she came upstairs and the body was gone but there was something written in the closet that said “I always will be watching you.”

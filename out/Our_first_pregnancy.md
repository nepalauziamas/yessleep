We were fortunate to get Dr. Singh. She came very highly recommended. She asked if we wanted to know if the baby was a girl or boy. I kind of wanted to know but Casey didn’t. 

The doctor wrote the name on a piece of paper and put it in an envelope. That way, we could look when we were ready. 

After she gave Casey the note, she asked if we wanted a boy or a girl. What response did she expect? "I just want it to be unhealthy," I thought and almost said out loud. They wouldn’t have thought it was funny. I’d obviously be joking. Damn them for their hypothetical judgments.

Doctor Singh started talking about her children. All girls who’s problems she can better relate to. She was clearly appealing to Casey, accurately recognizing her as the alpha in the relationship. 

As we were walking out she said, “it’s good to know. You can better prepare.” We continued walking but when I looked back, she gave me a strange look. Something about the doctor seemed strange.

Over the next t few days, I tried to convince Casey to look. I wanted to know so badly. It doesn’t matter if it’s a boy or a girl. I just want to know! It’ll make coming up with a name easier. We’ll know what kinds of clothes to buy. I’m just not good with stuff like that. Curiosity always gets the better of me. 

Casey wouldn’t budge, though. She wanted to be surprised on the day she gave birth. She won’t let me peek because she knows that I can’t keep a secret.  At least I wouldn’t have to try and talk her out of a goofy gender reveal party or something like that. 

Days went by and I stopped thinking about it so much. Casey is the boss and she’s always been one to stick to her guns. I would have given up on it completely if Dr. Singh never called the house. 

I answered the phone. I was concerned because she hadn’t called the house before and I’m prone to panic. 

“Hello, doctor. Is everything okay?!” 

“Yes, I’m just calling to check in. How is Casey feeling?”

“Not too bad. A little nauseous. Do you want to talk to her?” I asked.

“Oh are you home? I thought you’d be at work,” she said.

“No, I took a little time off. Casey’s just in the other room if you wanna talk to her.”

“No. I just.. Just checking in.. I guess you guys still don’t want to know the sex of the baby?”

“I do, but she wants to wait so that’s what we’re doing.” 

“Oh.. Well as a doctor, I think that’s a bad idea..” 

“What? Why?” I asked. 

The doctor acted very weird on the phone. Why did she care if I was at work? Why does she care so much about us knowing the sex of the baby? Before she responded again, I heard Casey scream.

I ran to the bedroom to find Casey in the fetal position screaming in pain. 

“What’s going on?!” I yelled. 

“It hurts!” Casey screamed. 

Doctor Singh was still on the phone. 

“Doctor, something’s wrong!” 

“I… I shouldn’t have called.” 

Doctor Singh started coughing into the phone before she hung up. Moments after she hung up, Casey started to calm down. 

“What happened?” I asked her.

“I don’t know.. I just had this horrible pain in my gut. It was like the worst cramp ever, then it just stopped. I feel okay now.” 

I struggled to process everything that had just happened. I sat on the bed silently for a moment trying to calm myself down. 

“I’m gonna get a glass of water,” Casey said. 

She got up and walked out to the kitchen. As I caught my breath, I noticed the envelope on her night stand. Curiosity got the best of me and I grabbed it. I got another empty envelope out of the drawer and replaced the real one. She came back moments later. 

I excused myself and went into the bathroom. I locked the door and opened the envelope. I unfolded the note inside. When I saw what the doctor had written, it sent shivers up my spine.. Just two words.. “Kill it”.  

Moments later, I heard a banging sound out in the hallway. I walked out of the bathroom and saw Casey standing in the doorway to the nursery. She had a large kitchen knife in her hand and was repeatedly stabbing it into the door frame and the drywall. 

I just stared at her, stunned. She had a smile on her face so wide that it looked painful. It was maniacal. She wasn’t blinking, just staring intensely at me as she continued jabbing the knife into the wall next to her. 

“What are you doing?!” I screamed. 

She started slowly walking toward me, stabbing holes along the wall as she moved through the hallway. 

As she was about midway through the hallway, she stopped and looked down at her stomach. She rubbed her hand around it a few times then lightly slid the knife across her belly.

She looked back up at me, still smiling in a manner that was utterly chilling. Then she spoke.. It wasn’t her, though. She spoke in a raspy, awful, guttural sounding voice..

“You shouldn’t have peeked.. I wanted it to be a surprise.”

I’ve locked myself in the bathroom again. I’m writing this for whoever finds it or to whom it may concern. I’m not sure, but this may concern everyone.. 

She hasn’t broken through the door yet, but she will. She started charging into the door moments after I locked myself in. She’s been repeatedly slamming herself into it. On one of her last attempts, I think I heard a bone snap. It didn’t deter her at all. It didn’t even slow her down. She just keeps ramming her shoulder into the door. 

It isn’t her.. It isn’t Casey.. I could fight back, but I won't. No matter the circumstances, I couldn't possibly do anything to hurt her.. And I certainly would never harm my own child..

Casey, if you are reading this, please take care of our child and protect them.. Something tells me they’re destined for great things...

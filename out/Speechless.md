I'm writing this from the bathtub. It's not what you think. Right now, I'm sitting in an empty tub with the curtain drawn, wearing the clothes I wore on my date.  Both the hotel room and bathroom doors are locked and bolted. Even so, I'm hiding in quietly in the bathtub.

My girlfriend Sophie and I have been in a long-distance relationship for two and a half years. It was my turn to visit her, so I bought my plane ticket. She told me there was some sort of renovation happening at her apartment building, so I booked a nice hotel room for us.

Sophie was unable to pick me up from the airport, so I got a taxi to our hotel. I told her to meet me there, but she suggested that I meet her for dinner instead. She made a reservation for 7:30 at Noir, one of our favorite restaurants.

After I was ready, I took the elevator down to the hotel lobby. The hotel was decidedly modern. Its design was all straight lines in metal, glass, and dark toned woods; nothing like the gilded monstrosity across the street.

Since the weather was so nice, I decided I would head to the restaurant on foot. It's not every day you find yourself in another city. I wanted to take in the sights and sounds of the city Sophie called home. The street was littered with rushing pedestrians and street performers.

Two performers caught my eye as I walked past them. The first was a disheveled folk guitarist. His clothes were worn out, but his guitar looked new and expensive. Some trust fund kid trying on a bohemian lifestyle perhaps.

The second performer was a mime. I always thought mimes were weird, but I never understood why people hate them. He looked like he was walking an invisible dog on an invisible leash. What caught my attention was it sounded like there was actually a dog panting. I wondered if this made him a ventriloquist, or if he was breaking some sort of mime code?

Dusk was setting in and the ornate streetlamps came on overhead. There was a smorgasbord of smells in the air. Some from Noir, others from the competition. My stomach made a noise, reminding me I hadn't eaten in a while.

I saw Sophie sitting at a table inside. She smiled when I waved to her. That smile, one of the reasons I fell in love with her in the first place. The ma√Ætre de tried to stop me as I came in. I pointed to Sophie sitting at the table, so he let me through with a hint of reluctance.

Sophie stood up and kissed me on the cheek. It was odd to be kissed on the cheek after we'd been apart for six months. I hugged her for a moment before sitting down. Her embrace was loose.

After we ordered some wine, she asked me how my flight was.

"Just fine," I said. "I took a taxi to the hotel. I think you're going to love the room, it..."

Sophie put her hand on my before I could finish the sentence.

"We need to talk," she said.

The phrase that's always the opening act for bad news.

"I won't be, staying with you at the hotel."

"Why not?"

"I..."

She looked down away from me.

"It's over."

For a moment I was speechless. 

"What do you mean it's over?"

"Us. We are over. Just, it's over. Okay?"

"No, it's not okay. What is this? I fly here. I get us a nice hotel room because your buildings being renovated. Wait, is your building even being renovated?"

Sophie shook her head. 

"And I'm guessing work wasn't crazy. You just didn't want to pick me up from the airport."

"I knew it would turn it to, well this."

The waiter brought the wine and started to pour. 

"Listen," I said, "could we have a minute? Please?"

The waiter walked off, leaving the bottle on the table. 

"What is this Sophie? What's going on with you? Why are you doing this?"

"My parents..."

"Your parents what?"

There was a long pause. 

"My parents don't approve of us."

I wasn't surprised Sophie's parents didn't approve of us. I'm just surprised she would cave to their wishes.  I shook my head and laughed. 

"So, we're going to end this? YOU'RE going to end this? Because your parents don't approve?"

A tear fell from each of Sophie's eyes. 

"Do your parents approve of us having dinner tonight? Or did you just want to break my heart at our favorite restaurant?"

"Please I.."

"I mean, you have me fly here, book a hotel, and ask me to dinner to break up? I thought this was working. I thought we worked in spite of the distance. I mean, why not just dump me over FaceTime or chat or email?" Most of our relationship is digital, didn't you want the end to go through the usual channels?"

She was crying now. I softened up a bit. 

"I love you Sophie. Don't you love me anymore?"

"Please I can't."

"If you don't love me anymore, then why did you even want me here?"

"I wanted to have one last dinner with you."

Two and a half years gone, wasted. All those video calls, texts, and emails. The times we spent together felt like vacations instead of dates. I was heartbroken, pissed off, and embarrassed. She was the oasis in the desert of my lonely life, but she didn't care. I pulled my hand away from hers. 

"Well, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with you. I guess we're both going to sleep disappointed tonight".

The waiter approached as I stood. 

"Please, don't go. Let's have dinner," Sophie said. 

"Will that change anything?"

"No, but let's..."

I walked away before she could finish. She called to me as I walked out the door. When I looked through the window, she was sobbing. The waiter and the other diners were either looking at Sophie or me as I walked away. 

Tears stung my cheeks as I walked down the street to whatever bar or cafe would help me forget my problems. Dusk had given way to night in the time it took to wait for a bottle of wine. 

The sidewalks were crowded. Once my initial anger subsided, I lost the will to fight against the tide of people and went into the nearest bar. Beer wasn't going to cut it tonight. I ordered my usual, then another, then another. 

While I was downing my third drink, I spotted a couple sitting at the other end of the bar. They were looking into each other's eyes, hanging on every word, and laughing at every joke. I slugged the drink and left. 

Even on my third drink, I was still sober. Some nights I'm a light weight and other nights I can hold my liquor. An iron liver was the last thing I wanted right after being dumped. I decided if I was going to take it to the limit, I should pick somewhere close to my hotel. A friend of mine calls that within stumbling distance.  

A few blocks from my hotel, the guitarist and the mime were performing their hearts out. It seemed people liked acoustic guitar more than pantomime, but that didn't surprise me. There was a bar right by them. I don't know why, but before I went in, I threw some money in their cases. 

The guitarist tried to play it cool and just gave me a nod without looking at me. When the money landed in the mime's case, his face lit up. He flashed a big smile at me, his yellowing teeth framed by black, painted lips. He bowed and took of his hat.  The silliness of it all made me smile for the first time in hours. 

My phone went off as I waited for my fourth drink. Sophie was calling me. I denied the call and paid for my drink. This bar was full of drunks and sports fans, no happy couples to pour salt on my wounds. 

By the time I finished my fourth I figured I should switch to beer. My stomach already felt like it was filled with turpentine, but I was finally starting to feel tipsy. Beer would do the job nicely. After I ordered my beer, I got a text from Sophie. 

"I never meant for it to end like this. I had hoped we could spend one last evening together. And just because we aren't together anymore doesn't mean I don't want you in my life. I still want to keep in touch with you. Just because we aren't in love doesn't mean we should never talk to each other again."

I rolled my eyes hard and took a huge swig of beer. For about a half hour I tried to think of what I should text back. I came up with everything from, "I don't want you out of my life either. Let's stay together," to "Fuck that and fuck you!". Then I decided the best response was no response at all. 

One of the drunks approached the jukebox as I put my phone in my pocket. He slurred words to his friend while he jabbed his fingers at the touchscreen. After about a minute he realized he needed to put money in. His friend started laughing at him. Once he got the money in, he jabbed the touch screen again. Every couple has a song, and this drunk asshole just picked mine. I left my beer at the bar with a tip. 

Outside the guitarist was stealing customers from the mime. The weather was still nice, so I decided to take a walk along the river. My phone started ringing again. This time I didn't even bother to deny the call. Perhaps I would block Sophie's number when I got back to the hotel. 

The city was bustling tonight, but the river offered me a quiet calm. Lights from the lamps and buildings around reflected of the ripples in the water. Late night runners jogged past me, while drunks threw up under bridges. Tourists took pictures against the skyline and couples made out on the benches. 

By this point I'd sobered up. I took a few minutes to look out on to the water. Police sirens blared off in the distance. I stood there, wondering if there was something wrong with me. Was there anything I could have done to prevent this? After some reflection, I realized it would take some time to find the answer. 

I looked at my phone. There was another missed call, but no texts or voicemails. The streets were starting to clear, so I decided it was time to head back to the hotel. 

Off in the distance I saw a figure hunched forward. There was no one else around so I called out. No response. I called out again, still nothing. As got closer, I crossed to the other side of the street. Since the figure was under the lamp, I could tell it was the guitarist. I looked around, but there was no one else.

"Hey are you alright?"

Something compelled me to get closer to him. Upon closer inspection I could see that his guitar had been smashed to pieces. The guitarist remained still. 

"I said are you alright?"

The guitarist was lying dead among the shattered pieces of his instrument. His face was frozen in a final expression of terror. He appeared to be crumpled up like a ball.  All of his limbs were broken at every joint, his head spun all the way around. I started to dial the police when I heard a commotion down the street. 

The street was empty except for the mime and an audience of four people. He was motioning his arms like he was playing the accordion. Oddly enough, I could hear accordion music playing as he moved his arms. 

"How fuccch yew dew tha," a stumbling tourist asked the mime. 

The mime kept playing, doing a little dance as he made music out of thin air. 

"I SAAAAY Howwa fuccch yew dew thaa," the man said again. 

I'll never know why this man thought a mime would respond. I know he was drunk, but everybody knows mimes don't speak. When the mime kept at it, the man pushed him. 

There was a sound like an accordion deflating, then the music stopped. The mime put his hands on his hips and looked directly at the man. The mine shoved him again, pushing the mime back a few steps. 

The mime clapped his hands together, pulled them apart about six inches, then acted like he was holding something. The man lunged for the mime, but the mime swiped at him.

"Ow shitta, yew fucchn cut me," the man yelled in slurred words. 

The man held his face, screaming in agony. One of his friends tried to attack the mime, but the mime swung at him. The friend grabbed his arm. 

"Son of a bitch cut me!" 

I moved to the corner so I could get a better look, making sure to hide behind a building. 

The stumbling man attempted another attack. The mime swung up like he was going to upper cut him. Gurgling sounds echoed down the street when his hand connected with the man's chin. He pulled his hand away, then acted like he was stabbing the man repeatedly. The man held his face and his chest stumbling back until he collapsed on the ground. 

I ran across the street and hid behind the corner of another building. This put me a block closer to my hotel while allowing for a better view. 

The man's friend tried another attack, but before he could the mime took a swipe. The man's friend grabbed at his throat. From this vantage point, I could see the spray of blood that shot out.  He collapsed on top of his friend. After a few seconds of convulsions, he let go of his throat and stopped moving. The other two, a short girl and a tall guy, started to run away from the mime. 

The mime turned towards the tall guy and acted like he was throwing a knife. Tall guy fell to the ground, howling in pain. He was reaching around his back like he was trying to pull something out, but there was nothing there. 

Snarling sounds filled the air. The mime was doing his dog walking trick again. He pointed at the tall guy squirming on and released an invisible dog. Tall guy let out a scream as it appeared he was being pulled from side to side. Growls mingled with the sound of ripping flesh. 

Short girl was running in my direction. For a brief moment her eyes connected with mine. They had a pleading look. Behind her, the mime rotated his arm like he was swinging a lasso then threw it. She had almost reached me when she came to an abrupt stop. 

"Please," she said to me. 

She squirmed as if her arms were immobilized, then she fell face forward to the ground. An invisible force pulled her back ten or fifteen feet. The mime approached her, acting like he was carrying a large mallet or something. He swung over his head, then brought the invisible mallet down on her head. 

Blood and brain matter shot out in all directions after a loud crunch and squish. Her hands went limp at her side and her feet stopped their struggle. Seeing her head crushed caused me to vomit. 

When I was finished emptying the booze and bile from my stomach I looked up. The mime was staring at me. I put my hands up as a sign of surrender. 

"Listen, I don't even know these people. I'm not involved in whatever all this is. Hey, I even tipped you remember?"

When I dropped the money is his case earlier tonight, he had given me a sweet albeit odd smile. Now he looked at me, his mouth a straight line. His jaw looked firm, his eyes stern. Without saying a word, mime clapped his hands. I shot him a puzzled look. It was then that I could hear padded feet running towards me from down the street. 

I ran down the alley behind the building, rushing towards my hotel. When I looked back, I saw the mime watching me from the end of the alley. Trash cans and boxes were knocked over by an invisible force about twenty feet behind me. 

Once I was out of the alley, I ran across the street to the large glass doors of my hotel. I dodged a car crossing the street, then opened the door and pulled it shut behind me. Right as I shut the door, there was a huge thud against the glass. There were slobber marks on the glass and barking right outside. 

I went through the second door. As soon as I got in, I pushed one of the lobby chairs in front of the doorway.

"Sir, may I help you with something," the concierge asked. 

"Yes," I said, "call the police. There's a mime, he's attacking people!"

The concierge laughed. 

"A mime you say?"

"Yes, I'm dead serious! There are people, out in the street! He killed them! I don't know how, but he killed them! I think he has an attack dog or something too!" 

"Sir, I'm sure..."

"Please for God's sake, just call the fucking police! It's a matter of life and death!"

The concierge picked up the receiver and started to dial. He didn't take his eyes off me as he did.  After all there was either a killer mime outside, or there was a lunatic in the lobby with him. Either way, he needed some sort of assistance. 

"Yes hello, yes I would like to report a disturbance. There may be possible violence. Yes, I'll hold."

I turned my head to see if somehow, I could spot the dog outside. Instead, I saw the mime walking towards the door. His striped shirt and his makeup had been spattered with blood. His lips formed a black slit in the middle of his face. He motioned as if he was loading a rifle or a shot gun. 

"Look," I said to the concierge, "he's right there!"

The mime aimed his invisible gun and the glass doors and shot. The first one exploded into a thousand pieces. He stepped through the first door, reloading as he did. 

Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the look of disbelief on the concierge's face. I was backing towards the elevator. There was a sudden crash through one of the lobby windows. I could hear padded feet running across the floor. I blindly pushed the buttons to the elevator. 

All of a sudden, the concierge looked like he was being attacked. Blood pooled in the air in front of his throat. Then the flesh right below his chin was ripped out. He fell to the ground screaming and flailing his arms. I felt the elevator doors open behind me. 

When I looked in front of me, the mime was taking his shot. The second door shattered into a thousand pieces as I backed into the elevator. As the doors closed, I saw the mime climb over the chair I placed there to block his entry. 

I went to press the button for my floor but decided against it. Instead, I pressed the floor below mine. I bounced in place as the elevator made its slow ascent. When I reached the floor, I darted for the stair well. 

Something was slamming against a door at the bottom of the stairwell, sending a deafening echo throughout. It was followed by a crash, then I could hear padded feet scaling the stairs. 

I ran up the flight until I reached my own floor. When I got through the door, I pulled a table sitting in the hallway and positioned it to block entry. After that I darted towards my room. Once I was inside, I locked and bolted the main door, then went into the bathroom. I locked that door too, then sat down in the shower and drew the curtain. 

I'm sitting here in the dark. I hope the police will be here soon. Until then I'm going to hide in here without making a peep. Just like a mime.

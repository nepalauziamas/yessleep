Me and my husband have been married for 5 years now and we were dating for 8 years before that. We were childhood friends that have known each all our lives and became sweethearts when we got into highschool. Many of our friends joke that we have the perfect fairy tale love. I love my husband dearly and I would say that other than his parents I know him the best out of everyone else. 

But recently he’s been acting strange, for example he started forgetting stuff, a lot of stuff. Stuff like our childhood memories, our future plans and forgetting where places we’ve gone to hundreds of times were. He forgot where he’s placed things and where things have always been before. This was strange of course but nothing that out of the ordinary, I thought I was just being paranoid. 

But then he started ordering and buying a lot of raw meat. He would always go into his office to eat these meats saying that he was embarrassed to be eating so much in front of me. When he came back there was no meat left, only the packaging. Of course at first I thought it was nothing strange as my husband has always been a meat nut but he kept doing it almost everyday spending hundreds on just these raw meats. He was always a meat nut before but never like this. Plus I’m not even sure there’s a way to cook meat in his office…

Other things were that he seemed taller and more perfect in a sense. He grew muscles and the fat on his body just disappeared. He looked like my husband but he just felt slightly off and for some reason not like a human. He also quit smoking which I’ve always wanted my husband to do but for some reason it just felt off. My husband has tried quitting smoking before but he’s always gone back to it or had some kind of withdrawal from not being able to smoke for long periods of time. But this time he just stopped it was as if he’s never smoked in the first place, even the smoke that I’ve always smelt on his body and breathe we’re gone.

Then earlier today we were being intimate and I put my hands on his head. Which is when I noticed that the scar that’s always been behind his head was gone.

 My husband got this scar when we were younger. We were swinging and he swung too high and fell off, his head hit a stone which caused him to have this scar. He got it stitched up and it healed but the faint scar never went away. That’s when it clicked that my husband's skin seemed to be perfect, too perfect. There was no callous on his hands, no faint scars of injury that he always had before. Not even any beauty marks were on his skin. 

This made me feel sick to my stomach, this kind of perfection wasn’t human, it didn’t feel human, and especially didn’t feel like my husband. I excused myself from doing anything further stating I felt sick, and we soon went to bed. Of course I was too tense to sleep which made it easy for me to sneak out when I felt that the thing pretending to be my husband was asleep. I took my car keys and my phone which I’m currently typing on and drove away. 

The final thing that made me know for sure that the thing or person pretending to be my husband wasn’t my husband was the fact that as I drove away I looked back and saw that thing standing at my bedroom window, the thing acting as my husband was staring at me and that yellow glint in his eyes made him seem more monster than human. It gave me the creeps and I drove even faster. 

I drove to my parents house and they think me and my husband must have been in a fight. I'm staying in my childhood room typing this out. I'm not sure what to do and I don’t even know if I should tell my parents, they might not even believe me. I'm scared and tired and I’m not sure what to do. But one thing is for sure that thing isn’t my husband. I have to go now because my parents want to talk, probably about why I’m here and what happened between me and my husband. When they opened my door earlier I swore I saw a yellow glint in their eyes, but maybe I’m just tired…

Hi everyone, I just put part 2 of my experience online.  You can see it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/51sndi/did_anyone_else_answer_this_ad_on_reddit_part_2/).

Hey Reddit, my name is Matt.  I'm kind of new to Reddit so if this is in the wrong place, I'm really sorry.  I'm still getting used to all the different "subs" (I think that's what they're called, right?) The idea of a common topic for each community seems really cool.  That's kind of what brings me here.  I haven't been sleeping much lately, so I thought I'd post my story here in "nosleep" and see if you all had any thoughts or advice.

It all started a month or two ago when I lost my job.  It was a factory job, and a pretty sweet one at that.  I got paid to pick aluminum siding up off one line, check it for defects, and move it to another line.  I did that for 10 hours a day, and did a pretty good job.  The company got bought out, and they told us that robots could do our jobs just as well, and that was that.  The company I'd worked at for 10 years just up and laid me off.  I got a few weeks worth of pay as severance, so I guess that was OK.  Unfortunately, I didn't really have any skills.  Siding was the only thing I had ever done, and I wasn't really sure what I would do now.  I got on with the job hunt and really tried hard.  I thought for sure something would fall into my lap, but it just didn't.  I started burning through my meager savings, and pretty soon, I was selling possessions to make ends meet.

Luckily, I just recently found a new job.  It's even in my field (of siding)!  I go out and install it on people's houses.  It's really not that bad, just kind of rough in the summer.  The crew I work with are really great guys, so shooting the shit with them makes up for the not-so-great pay and really demanding work.  That's how I found out about Reddit.  Tony and I were talking during a break a few weeks ago and he told me all about it:

"Yeah man, it's got all kinds of shit on there.  Funny shit, sad shit, interesting shit, it's got all of it.  Even naked ladies!"

Tony isn't a man of many words, but I could see his entire face light up when he talked about it.  I figured anything that made Tony light up couldn't be all bad, so I signed up.

I'm sure all of you are used to it by now, but Reddit is really overwhelming.  There's content everywhere!  Baby pandas rolling down hills, candlelight vigils that make you tear up, and something called a "poop sock"?  I don't know what that is, and I'm not sure I want to, Reddit is kind of weird sometimes.

Soon after I signed up, it was all I was doing.  Every spare minute was filled with Reddit, and I loved it.  Well, until I saw that link.  It was at the top of the page, and it said "Volunteers wanted!  You'll be compensated fairly.  Be your own person".  See, my paychecks hadn't arrived yet.  I was barely scraping by, and after two weeks of eating nothing but ramen, I was sick of it.  If there was even a slight chance I could make some extra money, I wanted to take it.  The link went to a research group called "[Gray and Dean Research](http://graydeanresearch.com)".  There's not a lot of information on their site, but from what I could find, they do some sort of behavior research.  I looked around the site for a little bit to try and get a better idea of what it was they did, but the huge "sign up" button called to me like a moth toward a flame.  They said I could be compensated for participating in their research study, and I didn't even need to leave the house.  They were vague on the compensation, but I just didn't care.  I think the sodium from all that ramen had started to affect my judgment, and I just took the leap and went for it.

They didn't even want that much information from me.  They wanted my email address, and for me to answer a couple of questions.

"Do you consent to Gray and Dean Research monitoring you throughout the duration of the experiment?"

"Do you understand that Gray and Dean Research may withhold compensation until a time where the experiment's criteria is met?"

"Do you believe that you are your own person, and that your actions are your own?"

Kind of weird questions, I know.  You know in retrospect, I probably wouldn't have agreed to them on any other day.  I was just so hungry, and poor, and tired of being poor.  I thought participating in some harmless experiments from home would be worth it if I could change my situation.  I also...well, this sounds crazy, so please just hear me out.  I felt COMPELLED to.  I don't know that I can explain it, I just went to the site, and I felt like I needed to do it.  Weirder yet, I didn't even really remember submitting it.  I just woke up the next day with an email in my inbox:

"Subject,

We're pleased to inform you that you've been accepted into our research study.  A username and password has been created for you.  Please login at the following address to start the experiment.  We look forward to your participation.

Gray and Dean Research | Department of Acquisitions"

Like I said, I don't really remember submitting the form, but I was a little out of it, I clearly did.  Even better than that, I got in!  Flashing through my mind were images of me in a hot tub with models; on a private yacht somewhere drinking champaign; never wanting for anything else in life.  These little day dreams were a welcome escape from my actual life, and with the money I'd get from this study, maybe I could at least drink beer at a lake.

I clicked the link, entered my username and password, and I was in the site.  I'm not really sure what I expected, but this definitely wasn't it.  I was instructed to focus intently on a movie that they would be playing in my browser.  I was to watch it for a minute, and then answer a series of questions.  I read the instructions, and proceeded to the next step.  I'm not sure what kind of video this was, but it wasn't like anything I had seen on Reddit before.  It was red in the middle with a bunch of static around it.  Something about it though, it made me feel...different.  As I'm writing this, I'm trying to find the words to explain how it made me feel, or why it felt slightly off, but I just can't.  All I know is that the video wasn't right, and it made me feel disjointed and like I wasn't myself.  

Even though every fiber of my being was saying this video was wrong, I watched the whole thing.  I still needed the money after all.  After a minute, I was directed to the questionnaire, and that's really where things got weird.  It wasn't that long, although I don't remember the exact length.  Most of it was fairly mundane:

"Do you consider yourself a good person?"

Well yeah.  I think so.  I clicked "yes".

"Are good people capable of bad things?"

Um, I guess so.  I clicked "yes".

"Are you capable of bad things?"

I started to get a little uncomfortable now.  I had never really thought about what I was capable of.  Come to think of it, most of my life had been spent sort of just drifting and being on auto-pilot.  When I really started thinking though, I suppose I was capable of bad things, but I had no desire to act on them.  I clicked "yes".

"Would you hurt someone?"

This question seemed fairly vague.  What did they mean?  I played a little bit of football in high school, and I had given out my share of hard hits.  It wasn't mean spirited though, it was just part of the game.  I guess I could hurt someone though.  I clicked "yes".

"Would you kill someone?"

This strange little questionnaire was making me do more soul searching than I had done in my entire life.  I was perfectly content not thinking about how far I'd go in unfortunate or desperate situations.  I had to answer though, and when I really thought about it...I clicked "yes".

"Would you kill someone?"

I just answered that!  I was starting to get a little bit freaked out now.  I clicked "no".

"You are your own person"

That's not even a question.  Of course I'm my own person.  The strange thing about this one was that there weren't multiple choices, just a "yes" box, so that's what I clicked.

After I had completed all the questions, I glanced up at the clock and realized two hours had passed.  Man, it was already 11pm!  Where did the time go?  I could have sworn that I started just 10 or 15 minutes ago.  Also, when did I get such a splitting headache?  I decided to take a nice hot shower and retire for the evening to get some much needed sleep.

Honestly though, I don't think I slept at all that night.  I just laid awake in bed, and tried to let my exhausted body rest, but my mind wasn't having it.  A constant stream of intrusive thoughts kept me awake.

"Would I kill someone?  Do I want to kill someone?  Am I my own person?"

The disjointed thoughts kept racing through my head.  I desperately wanted them to stop, but they just wouldn't.  So I did something drastic.  Something I try not to do; something bad.

I smoked some weed.

I know what you're thinking:

"Matt, you're working at a construction job and using tools that could hurt people, why are you doing drugs the night before you have to work?"

Well I used weed pretty heavily when I was younger, and besides giving me a terminal case of the munchies, it typically helped my headaches, and always helped lull me to sleep.  I figured half a joint might do the trick tonight and allow me to actually fall asleep instead of just laying in bed awake and miserable.

I had just lit it and taken a big puff when my cell phone lit up the night and startled me with its tinny rendition of Biz Markie's "Just A Friend".

"Youuuuu, you got what I neeeeeed, but you say he's just a friend, but you say he's just a a friend, oh baby youuuu"

I picked up.

"Hello?"

I waited for a few moments, but there was nothing but the faint whispers of static on the other end, and then a robotic voice saying words I didn't understand the meaning of.  Then there was nothing.  Just like that part of my life had been erased, and I was here in the present.

I was in my living room.  My phone was no where to be seen.  The light was pouring in from my window and illuminating my entire apartment.  My mind started racing with anxious thoughts and panic.  Oh god, when did the sun come out?  What time is it?  I'm late to work!  Why does my head hurt so much.  Where is my phone?  Oh god, I'm REALLY late to work.

Waking up late is the worst feeling in the world typically, but today, the splitting pain in my head was giving it a good run for its money.  I trudged to the bedroom with squinting eyes, trying to block out the sunlight coming in from the windows to give my head some relief from the pain.  My phone was lying on the floor and it said I had missed 7 calls.

"Shit."

I texted my boss and told him that I had been up all night sick, and lost track of time.  I told him I'd stay home today, and be in tomorrow.  He seemed to accept that, and I felt the smallest bit of my anxiety abated.

I sat down on the bed and put the phone on the nightstand.  My head was still splitting, and I just wanted it to stop.  I put my head in my hands and felt my eyes welling up with tears of frustration and pain, and that's when I noticed it.

Dirt.  On my palms, and under my fingernails.  Where did it come from?  I had taken a shower before bed, and it definitely wasn't there last night.  I don't remember weed doing this to me before.  Maybe it's gotten stronger?  You know they talk about that on the news all the time.  I pushed my confusion out of my thoughts for the time being.  My brain couldn't handle it right now.  I was confused and scared, but the pain center was overriding all logical thought.  All I could do was lay down and try to sleep.  I don't feel like I actually went to sleep, but then again, I don't really remember.  I think I must have though, I remember dreaming about running through a field, chasing something, maybe someone.  I don't know why I'm chasing it, or why it's running from me.  I just know I need to catch it.  Somehow during the chase, it falls, and I fall on top of it.  There's a struggle.  I hit it.  I feel nothing.

So that's where I am now Reddit.  It's been another day since I missed work, and the headache is starting to subside, but I still feel a bit out of sorts.  I really just want to get back to sleeping regularly, and feeling like myself again, but I'm not sure how.  Do you have any advice?  I don't like how I feel.  I don't feel like I'm my own person.

My 11 year old son was in a horrible accident 4 months ago.  I don’t want to get into the specifics of what happened, but it left him with disfiguring 3rd degree burns all across his face, head, and upper torso.

The first week at the hospital were the worst days of my life.  I can’t even begin to imagine how bad they were for my son.  He wouldn’t cry underneath those bandages.  He wouldn’t even speak.  He sometimes just let out an agonizing moaning sound.  I asked my doctor in hysterics what was happening.  I was eventually able to get out of him that my son was in absolute excruciating pain, and that movement of his mouth or face made things dramatically worse.   So he just sat in silence.  The thought of that still haunts me.  To be in such indescribable pain… and have to just sit there, moment by moment, with no escape or distraction.  The doctor explained that they were medicating him as best they could, but that there was only so much they could do.

When they first took the bandages off my son I screamed out loud.  I didn’t mean to.  I thought I was prepared for the worst.  But I wasn’t.  I was horrified.  I couldn’t even look at him.  It made me feel *sick* to even think about his appearance.  My son was speaking again by this time.  “It’s that bad mom?”  he asked, his voice quivering.  We showed him a mirror.  He remained silent.  He didn’t speak.  He just sat in silence for hours, ignoring us.  Eventually he looked at me.  I immediately turned away.  I couldn’t help it.   Quietly, almost mouse like, he said, “They’re going to fix me, right mom?  It will all be ok, right?”  I couldn’t lie to him.  But I also couldn’t tell the truth.  Instead, I did something worse.  I cried.  I lowered my head in my hands.  And I cried.  

My son stayed in the hospital for months.  Various skin grafts were attempted but they didn’t help.  In fact, they somehow made my son look even worse.  He barely looked human any longer.  Family members and some of his friends wanted to visit him, but he refused.  He wouldn’t even consider it.  He told me that he never wants another person to look at him ever again.  He said that he never wanted to leave the hospital room.  Ever. 

But of course the time eventually came for him to return home.   At first, things were sort of ok.  He holed himself up in his bedroom playing video games.  It was a great escape for him.  He wore a hat and sunglasses at all times, and it actually helped.  At least a little.  The hospital set him up with a psychiatrist to help him cope with his new reality.  Last week the psychiatrist met with me privately.  He told me that I can’t keep sheltering him in his room.  That I need to get my son out into the world.  That he needs to slowly learn to accept his appearance.

So a few days later I decided to take him downtown.  We’d have lunch and walk on the beach.  It took a lot of convincing, but my son eventually agreed.  He put on his usual sunglasses and hat and we went outside to the bus stop.  I could tell my son was worried.  I was worried as well.  We both had no idea how the world would react to him.   We got on the bus and sat down in the front.  The seats were sideways at this area, so the rest of the bus was looking at us.  A little girl that was near us looked at my son.  She grabbed her mother.  She looked at my son again, and almost started crying.  She whispered to her mother.

Her mother picked her up, gave me an “I’m sorry” look, and took her daughter to the back of the bus.  

Did my son see that?   I didn’t know.   We had only moved a couple of stops, but already I noticed other people pointing.  Whispering.  People looked disgusted.  I was just hoping so much that my son wasn’t noticing.  But then he quietly whispered “Mom, they’re looking at me.”

I whispered back to him, “No they’re not.  Everything’s ok.”

But then he got louder, “Mom, everyone’s looking at me.  They’re all looking at me.”  

Some of the people sitting near us got up at that point.  They moved away from us.

“Mom,” he continued.  He was now almost yelling.  “They’re all looking at me.  They’re staring.  They’re *staring*.”

“Calm down” I tried telling him.  “They’re only looking because you’re yelling.”  I saw a teenager pull out his phone and start recording us.

“NO!” my son shouted.  “That’s *not why they’re looking.  They were already looking.  Lets get out.  I want off."

The little girl at the back of the bus was now crying.  Loudly.  “Ok.” I said.  I pressed the button flagging the next stop.  

“They’re looking at me” my son continued. Almost yelling.   “I want off.  Now.  I want off.  Take me home.  TAKE ME HOME.”  Some people were now laughing about the situation.

And then I lost control of myself.  I didn’t even know I was doing it till it was too late.  I screamed, loudly and piercingly in hysterics:

“**STOP STARING AT MY SON!**”.

The entire bus went silent.  Everybody was looking at us.  The driver had pulled over, and we weren’t even at a stop.  “Ma’am, can you and your son please exit the vehicle.”

We were both crying.  We walked home.

That night I ordered a package online.

That night was also when his nightmares started.  He would scream in the middle of the night, in his sleep.  Wailing screams.  He didn’t even know he was doing it.  They would keep me up at night.  He would never tell me what the dreams were about.  But sometimes when he woke up I’d hear him crying.  Talking to himself.  His voice quivering.  This is when I first noticed that I was actually becoming *scared* of my son.  I said earlier in this post that my son barely looked human any longer.  He was starting to no longer sound human either.  The loud screams at night became increasingly guttural.   Sounds that no little boy could ever make.  If I stood outside his door at night, I’d sometimes hear him whispering to himself in between screaming.  Words that I didn’t understand.    It was either gibberish or an entirely different language.  A language like I’d never heard before.

Last night I woke up very late.   There was silence.  I listened for my son, but I couldn’t make anything out.  I had the sense that something was watching me.  A small amount of moonlight was sneaking in.  Just enough for me to see something peering at me around my bedroom door.  It was my son.  His horribly disfigured face just slightly lit up by a faint ray of light.  He stared at me.  And then he began whispering again.  In that alien language.  

I screamed as loud as I could.  My son turned and ran back into his bedroom.  It’s now hours later, and he still hasn’t left that room.  I didn’t even try to get back to sleep again. I turned on my computer and started writing out these very experiences.

My package arrived early this morning.  

I also did some research.  I found out that this is a condition called teratophobia.  The fear of disfigurement and disfigured people.  It got me thinking… has my son’s disfigurement driven him crazy?  Or am I suffering from extreme teratophobia, and my mind is exaggerating these experiences?

I’m not sure.  But what I do know is that my son can’t do this alone.  And neither can I.  It’s become abundantly clear.  A mother should do anything for her son, right?  I can’t fix his grotesque and horrifying appearance.  But I can make him feel less alone.  To give him a partner.  My son and I will be in it together.  How better to confront your fear than to specifically turn into an example of its focus?

I opened the package.  I looked at its content.  Nitric acid.  I wondered how I should splash it on my face.  I don’t want to lose my eyesight in this process.  I suppose I’ll have to do a little more research.  

But I don’t want to waste too much time.  Because I would like to wake my son up this morning.  As his equal.  And to show him that he’s not alone.  That together, things won’t be so scary.  Things won’t be so isolating.  Things will be better.  I’ve heard the quote before “There’s no bitch on earth like a mother frightened for her kids.”  Well, maybe it’s time for my son and I to frighten the world back.  Maybe we’ll even grow to like it.  We’ll have to learn to like it.  No matter what, we’ll have to learn.

First off, before I really delve into all this, I'd like to take a minute to say that I'll be writing about deeply personal feelings, specific behaviors, and childhood trauma. I'd like to warn those actively struggling with any ED, feeling suicidal, or suffering with PTSD stemming from childhood abuse, this monstrous tale may trigger you. Please please please, read with caution or, if things are really bad, do not read. Please.  


We all have a little bit of monster inside of us. Some bigger than others. Some more powerful. Some entirely innocuous, some insidious. Some outright malicious. Some like to hurt others, while others enjoy turning it inwards.  


In a lot of humans, our monstrous bits are so small that they are drowned out by our true selves. Our true selves are, for lack of a better word, our souls. The human soul is like a powerful white light, brighter than our eyes can even understand or tolerate. And yet it can be crushed to bits or sucked dry by a strong enough monster. Most people I meet lately have tired, dim souls, but they are still intact.  


To see someone with a crushed soul is heartbreaking, a deep void in place of their own livelihood. This is usually the point where those unfortunate souls decide to give up the fight. The human sees no other option. I've been there too many times and somehow always made it through. Someone once told me I should [go forward and believe](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/by48zv/hitchhiking_is_terribly_dangerous_you_never_know/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) in the face of hardship; I'm not religious, but I truly believe my life is worth something these days, and so I keep moving forward.  


I was about 24 years old when it got bad, but really it had been there long before then; I can remember actively wanting to die in the 7th grade. It has followed me for as long as my mind had been capable of storing decipherable memories. The darkness. The obsession. The self hatred. The haunting. The monster that speaks in my voice. My poor soul tried everything to fight it, and still the darkness started to win. My soul is... well, it's damaged, to say the least. Along with my body. The monster has reaked havoc in my life, in ways beyond my comprehension.  


Alright so, let me back up for a second, back to when I was a quickly growing 7 year old little girl. I would be weighed by my mom regularly. If I gained a pound or two, she would tell me not to tell dad so that he wouldn't be mad. As I later discovered, she didn't give a flying fuck how much I weighed, even though I was a perfectly average weight anyway, but in her mind, she was basically following orders. "Avoiding conflict," as she calls it these days. She didn't think it'd have such lasting effects.  


Truly my father was a complete dick, but he had his own haunting. He was doomed to be the dense and ignorant asshole he was raised to be, and my mother just went along with his bullshit for years as her mother did before her. Up until pretty recently, she still put up with his wet-brained bullshit.. for a loooong time. As they get older, they play out their roles as if stuck in a loop, not realizing that there is a path out of the loop, and it becomes smaller and smaller as each day passes. I hope she stays on this little path away from him. Since I've lived far away from them for several years, I sometimes wonder if that tiny path is even there anymore for him at all.  


I don't tell you all this to get your pity, I don't want any of it. I say it to mark when and why the appetite really began. There's something about being told you'll be in trouble for being fat that really makes you believe you're fat, even if you're just a normal growing child. And there's something about thinking that being this fat is bad, thus making you bad, that instills a special kind of self hatred, even if some of the people in your life actually truly care about you. There's something to embracing your badness, some point of no return that is all too easy to reach. And I reached it quickly.  


It started with eating second helpings. It felt so good to overeat, and I wanted it more because I knew it was bad. It grew to full on binges by high school, and I hit 300 pounds by the time I was 24. That was the tipping point. Seeing that 300 staring at me from the scale was mortifying, and I snapped. I started purging my binges. God, I wish I had never started.  


You'll hear lots of bulimics say (if you catch one who's open about it; we're well known for being secretive) that they wish they'd never started. It's a common statement for those who have chronically purged for a while; it becomes an absolute living hell. But really, though we aren't \*lying\* necessarily, I'd venture to say that a pretty solid percentage of us simultaneously love it and don't regret starting... weird, conflicting thoughts common with EDs. I was in that group for a long time. I would say I hated it, and part of me really did, and I really did want to hate it with all of me... but at the same time, I fucking loved it. It was the perfect self destruction. I got to eat anything, while the pounds just melted away and people showered me in compliments. Everything else I'd ever done to hurt myself was met with shame, and this one gave me more positive attention than I'd ever known. My dad was among those. Even once he found out I'd lost it all by puking, he said I should still be proud of myself for losing the weight. Solid parenting, dad.  


You'll also hear about lots of bulimics who don't lose that much weight or even gain some. That did happen at some point, but that first hundred pounds slipped right off in less than a year, and I was absolutely drunk on control. It was heaven for a long time. Felt like it, at least. I didn't regret doing it at all for years. I wanted to regret it, but the weight loss was too good. It felt good to get rid of all my guilty pleasures, fix the one mistake I knew for sure I could fix when everything else was absolute chaos.  


Yea. I know. It's typical, right? It's a good bit about control for me, not as much about weight, especially these days. It's a stereotype because of how often it is accurate.  


When shit hits the fan, however, things quickly become totally out of control. The disorder makes the chaos worse. I become a slave to it. No longer in control. I wish I could say it was about how I care more about taking care of my body now, though that is somewhat true, but it's probably more about the loss of control. I hate it. I hate it more than I hated being fat. And I fucking HATED. Being. Fat.  


I finally started regretting it about 4 years ago. I was homeless at the time, having just about destroyed my life with lots of drugs and even more self loathing. By the time my husband and I decided leave our home state, I was having full on suicidal thoughts. We wanted to go somewhere we could make it, somewhere better than the wasteland where we grew up. We cleaned ourselves up in the process; detoxing on the road was a bitch, but it needed to be done. The only thing that stuck around was that pesky bulimia.  


So, when you're homeless, you try to take any meal you can get. There might be a day when you can't find a free meal, so you really gotta stockpile that energy; we usually had to keep moving around most of the day. I struggled with that, because I was at the point of getting rid of everything I ate. It was compulsive and incredibly hard to avoid. I was at my lowest weight, delicate collarbones jutting out in just the way I'd always dreamed they would. But it was so cold, and it hurt to sit for too long. At night when sleeping on the ground, I would toss and turn because my hips and back hurt. It was absolute misery.  


About 6 months into being on the street in the south, we got on a train and went to the northwest. It took some time and kindness from others, but we both got jobs and stayed in a shelter for a while. We would stay in a hotel once a week for.. private time.  


Well. I lapsed on my birth control, got pregnant, then miscarried.. that's a story I'll definitely need to tell in full another time. All I'll say about it is that I was simultaneously terrified at the thought of going through a whole ass pregnancy and having a kid while homeless, weirdly sad that I ultimately lost it, and super fuckin relieved that the biggest choice I had to make about the whole thing was whether or not I wanted to have a D&C. I told them to just suck it out, and have since decided to remain childfree.  


I mention that mainly because while I was pregnant, I started doing therapy and actively trying to recover from my eating disorder. For the kid, I told myself. At first, I kind of resented the fetus for existing and needing me to provide adequate nutrition. When I miscarried, I could've easily relapsed, but I think I had really started wanting it for myself, too. I stuck with it, and my therapist helped me through a lot. Homelessness is extremely traumatic, as I'd come to realize.  


Anyway, it was about 6 months before we finally found a place to live with a couple of roommates. My anxiety skyrocketed at the sudden change; I became hypervigilant and terrified of being outside. I started taking meds again (I've been on and off of them for over a decade now). Things seemed to improve a little.. I kept food down, gained a bit of weight. A healthy amount. I wasn't quite as fragile as I had always preferred being, and I was starting to become ok with that.  


The weight gain was ok at first, I guess. I felt physically better, and I had a pretty active job as a dog handler; it required lots of energy and some muscle mass, so I was eating more and still toning up. I maintained that same weight while gaining some muscle, and I actually felt kind of comfortable inside my body for the first time in my entire life. Then that job went south (crazy husband/wife small business owners, amirite), and I had to settle for a cashier position at a local grocery store. I gained weight quickly without the extra exercise, plus the cheap snacks and alcohol constantly at my disposal. Historically, any time I start feeling fat, I panic and backtrack. This time was no different, but it was a hundred times worse.  


At some point things got really bad, as they always do. A few months into my relapse, I struggled to eat anything at all; when I did, I purged it immediately. One day, I tried to eat a cucumber and keep it down. As soon as I felt it in my stomach, I started retching, my body tensing up for what always comes after eating. I tried to wait a few minutes, tried distracting myself. I just couldn't.. The vomit begged for escape. I ran to the bathroom and threw up the cucumber, then continued heaving until every little bit was gone. Something round came up in my throat, a lump that felt solid and heavy. Not like a heavily chewed cucumber at all. I jammed my hand down my throat, spit and bile covering my fingers and dribbling down my chin. I fucking hated that nasty shit, and still the release was too hard to resist. Bulimia is a disgusting illness by the way, just in case you were thinking of trying it. Don't.  


It took a while, but I finally got it up.. Only to immediately start dry heaving again. If there was any vomit left, it would've come up. Because right there in the toilet practically staring back up at me, was an entire eyeball. It looked monstrous, lumpy and bloodshot with only black in the middle. Tiny veins of black came from the pupil and created a webby looking veil over the whole eye.  


I blinked hard, hoping I wasn't seeing it right. It was still there, staring directly in my direction.. I flushed it immediately, unable to shake the fear that it could see me. My brain furiously tried to rationalize it, but something felt very fucking wrong.

So.
Listen to me, buddy.
I'll tell you what.
I din't believe in this shit like ghosts.


Usually.


But I was home alone, okay?
I was going to jerk off, like- dude, it was a year ago, year and a half, was 17 at the time, of fucking course I was going to watch porno and to jerk off when I was completely alone in my house, okay?
My mother is super religious and always breathing down of my neck, dude, I couldn't even close my bedroom's door when she was home, because she didn't want me to stop Jesus from coming for me and all that creepy christian jazz.


And like- I was in my bedroom.
Window and door closed.


That thing of Jesus blocked by my door was probably ingrained in my head, because I couldn't stop feeling watched, okay?
I was being paranoid, it was late at night, I was about to be a damn sinner and of course, I didn't want ol' Jes to walk on me with my dick in my hands.
I closed the window too, to be sure.


Now.


I couldn't get it up.
Or focus on the girls on my computer's screen.


I don't know, dude, I was shivering.
Just- long, nauseating chills down my spine.
I felt observed, and my dog was acting crazy downstairs, but he always did, that old bastard.
I loved the dog, okay? He was my best friend, I grew up with him, he almost had my age and he was an old blind ball of fur.
Loved 'im. My good ol' Buddy.
But he was a little dumb, and at night he barked like an entitled and old white man would do if I kissed my actual boyfriend in front of his grandkids.


And for nothing, dude!


And like I had this crazy thought that maybe my ex was stalking me again.
Had a crazy girlfriend for a few months back then, and I left her after she kept stalking me both during our relationship, and after I broke up with her because she was jus' a weirdo.
Man, she was so obsessed with me that she harmed me, once. See this scar over my arm? She did this, cut me with a knife to collect my blood, said that she knew a ritual to bond us forever.
Crazy stuff.
Had to broke things off next day, and she went even more crazy, but me and my mother then moved in England, and that crazy bitch remained in Ohio.


Couldn't be her, y'know?


But I was so scared, dude, and I was sure I smelled her cologne.
When she started stalking me after the break up, she acted... she wasn't normal. She snuck up on me at every occasion, and she once tried to hide in my wardrobe, but Buddy was still seeing at the time, caught her immediately.
Then me and ma' moved to England.


And like that night I wasn't in the mood, and I started gaming on my computer instead.
At some point I got cold, and had to pause to close my bedroom's window.


Dude, I heard her giggling.


I was absolutely awake, bro.
I didn't dare to drink or smoke, mom barely lets me have Monsters in the fridge, I was lucid.
I freaked out.
I don't believe in shitty ghost stories, but when I started to hear noises all around the house, inside the walls... was scary.
Mom tried to bless the house, things got quiet for a day, but whenever I was alone, I heard her murmuring my name, or giggling.


Bro.


I did my research, learned she disappeared.
Police can't find her, but they were looking for a corpse so as far as I know she died, was too sick and all. Never dug too many informations on the case.


He ghost was haunting me, dude.
Swear to ol' Jes.
I don't close my door anymore, want the big guy on a cross to keep helping me, y'know?
But things still went missing, and moved around, and she still called my name for weeks.


Crazy.


But it's more quiet now.
When we found Buddy mauled in the crawlspace under the house with a big kitchen knife stuck in his guts, mom called a priest to bless the house, then me and her did some repairing, closed up all the holes and cracks, I had to say goodbye to the lil' crawlspace behind my wardrobe where I used to hide my Playboys, changed everything, closed the crawlspace under the house.
The ghost didn't like that, banged on the walls all the time, asked me to let her get out. The priest blessed the house everyday until the ghost become so weak I barely heard her, and then she stopped.


Never got another problem with those things.
Never.


I don't believe in many things, dude, but I believe in this.

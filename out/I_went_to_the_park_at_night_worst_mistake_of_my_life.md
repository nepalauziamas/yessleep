It all started a few years ago. Me and my friends were super into horror movies. Well, we wanted to get a "cooler" experience. Also, we often frequented a park near our houses that has a forest with a creek running through it. The creek contains radioactive runoff from a nearby landfill, so it has claimed many lives. Well, it was dark and we were exploring the park when we saw a small doorway shaped hole in the low-hanging branches. We crawled through and what we saw was beautiful. The trees were very tall, but the branches hung down low giving it the effect of a fully closed in room. It was an open area with few trees on the inside, and a 10 foot drop to the creek next to us in the center. We wanted to explore, because we had never been in here before. We walked along the edge of the drop until we started hearing voices. It was faint whispers, barely there. We shrugged it off and continued deeper in. This is when things got weird.

We started to notice stuff littering the ground. Gloves, coats, pants. So many clothes. We also noticed multiple cages with nothing in them. We assumed it was probably just trash that had been left, but whenever I'd walk past something I got the chills. The deeper we got the more stuff we found. I also started to notice clumps of hair stuck to some of the trees. This was when I started to get a really bad vibe. The whispers had turned into incoherent screams. I asked my friends to turn away, asked to leave, but they said they just wanted to reach the end. So I took a deep breath and pushed forward. We reached a point where I started to see reddish-brown stains on the path and a disgusting smell hit me. Through the screams I could hear someone saying my name. It grew more persistent, and I realized it was my sister yelling my name. I had no idea how she got here but she sounded scared. I bolted towards the voice until I saw her. I reached out for her hand but once I grabbed it, it was like she just disappeared.

I don't know what happened next or how we escaped, but I woke up the next morning in a hospital bed. My friends said I started to freak out and passed out, so they called an ambulance. When I asked about my sister they looked confused and told me she was home safe. The doctors said I had a severe panic attack, but I had never had one like that before. When I was allowed to leave the hospital, I went back to the park alone this time. I brought a Ouija board with me this time. I went to the trees and through the doorway and ran along the cliff until I was back to where I was the last time. I set up the Ouija board and asked questions. I didn't get any responses for a few minutes, but then I felt my hand be compelled to move. I watched as it went to each letter to spell a word. R.... U... N... run? By the time I realized, it was too late.

I tried to run but whatever spirit or ghost was haunting the place got me. I rose into the air and felt my entire body become freezing cold. It felt like I was dipped into an ice bath. My chest hurt so bad and I couldn't breathe. Suddenly, I dropped to the ground. There was a voice in my head that wasn't my own, like I was sharing my brain with someone else. It was angry, hurt. I could feel it's feelings, too. I knew I needed to get out of there But when I tried to run I started to see things. Dead animals, blood, carvings. Spiders were everywhere, crawling all over me. When I got back to the entrance everything stopped. And despite having gone in there at night, the sun was up. I could have sworn I was only in there for an hour at most. I never told anyone that I went back, but I decided that it was just my mind playing tricks on me. It was just showing my my greatest fears.

It's been 2 years now, and sometimes I still can hear the other persons thoughts in my mind. He hears me, too. I know he does. I get the urge to go back to the place from time to time, like an addiction I can't get over. Maybe if I go back I can get my mind back..

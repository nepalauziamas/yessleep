My name is Christopher, and I live in Florida. Honestly, it's not as crazy as everybody would think with the "FLORIDA MAN DOES THIS" headlines, It's pretty nice here. I work a part-time job at McDonalds while at college, of course, I'm not gonna say which one for privacy reasons, as I'm already pretty freaked out. I was scrolling around on Reddit and found something called the "fingernail test" or something like that, and decided that it sounds pretty cool, so I tried it on my own mirror.  


I was shocked to find out it was a 2 way mirror in my own bathroom, mind you, this is in a college dorm, so I thought I was safe there. I decided to stay out of the bathroom for the entire day before finally deciding to remove the mirror and see what's up at night. I went to McDonalds to work there for a little while, before I began realizing that something was off. This one dude was a regular, and would come there to order a third-pounder and a Sprite, before sitting down at a table and working on something on his laptop. I got a bit curious, since from what I've heard, he comes in every single day, and the guy is still pretty thin, even after a month or two of coming every single day. I got curious so I did a little digging on the guy, he was always shifty and never revealed his name to anybody, and would always sit by this one table at a corner of the place. Today, he was sitting at a sort of angle, and I saw an opportunity. I went to serve the lady to the seat next to him, and while serving her, I peeked over at his Laptop. I probably expected to see him looking at a camera feed of some hidden camera behind the 2 way mirror in my dorm, but no, he was messaging somebody on Discord, just sending the current date, the current time, and then a bunch of coordinates. While I stood there, he was just typing in the same thing, like he was spamming the guy on the other end, but when I moved a bit back, I noticed that he changed the coordinates. Already a bit strange, and probably obvious that it's some Truman Show stuff, but I shrugged it off as some weird mentally deranged guy.  


I was already pretty shaken from that, but it just got a whole lot worse when I went back to my dorm and took down the mirror. My roommate was already pretty hesitant about it, but I told him that it was for our safety, and finally managed to convince him to help me. We unscrewed the mirror and what was behind it absolutely terrified me. It was not a camera, not a room, not a hole or a pipe or anything else, just... Nothing. Like a void. I threw a breath mint in and it just disappeared the moment it went past the place where the mirror originally was. Rich, my roommate, just decided that it would be best to put the mirror back, but I argued with him and we both began fighting over the mirror, I wanted to see what's going on, he wanted to leave the void alone. He eventually slipped and dropped the mirror, and I nearly fell as well, grabbing the sink below the void and dropping the mirror halfway in. I pulled the mirror out and it looked withered and old, covered in moss and mold and god knows what else. Rich got pissed off at me and just decided to go back to the cafeteria, while I stayed behind and continued experimenting. I got a stick from outside the college, stuck it in, and when I pulled it out, the other end of the stick looked like it had been laying in a forest for what seems to be years.  


I called my friend, Gordon, and he came over to see what the big deal was. He kept thinking it was some surprise party or a joke or something, but he saw the void and got even more skeptical. He kept  asking me where I got "vanta-black paint" and I kept telling him that it isn't paint, so he reached over to scratch it off, trying to prove he was right, and when he stuck his hand in, he was instantly pulled directly through. I was completely shocked but jumped through, like, 6 seconds later. When I jumped in, I saw our dorm, but instead, it was decrepit and covered in moss. I'm using my mobile data to write this post to see if anybody is still out there, since I still see thousands of people online on Reddit, and I found one of those signal towers or whatever. Take this story as a cautionary tale, since I haven't been able to get out of this place for 4 months now, and there's been a low hum that I keep hearing every now and again. I built the dorm up as a sort of base, but my spear is broken and I couldn't get back to the dorm in time, the humming has been getting louder and louder. I still remember that weird guy at McDonalds, and I haven't been able to find Rich anywhere, let alone any other sign of life.  


Now the only thing I can pray for is that whatever is out there has mercy.

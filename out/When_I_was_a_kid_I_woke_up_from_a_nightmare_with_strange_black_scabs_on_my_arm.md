When I was about six years old, I was having awful nightmares almost every night. I’d wake up at 2-3 in the morning in a sweat. My mom tried everything to try to get rid of them. I never ate before bed, got plenty of sleep every night, I had a night light, and we tried out sleep meds for a bit (which ultimately just made it worse). After awhile I just got used to it, I’d wake up and go back to sleep without a problem. 

One night I was having another nightmare, and I don’t really remember what happened but it was one of those dreams where you can feel everything. So in my dream I could feel this horrible, burning pain on my left forearm. And in my dream when I looked down at it there were these three little black dots. Two of them were about 2 inches away from my wrist, side by side, and the third was a bit lower and kind of off to the right. It was the worst pain I had ever felt, and when I woke up I could still feel a little burning sensation in the same place. 

Immediately I turn my arm over and check it, and what do you know, there’s three little scab-like dots on my forearm. Same spot as the dream. If you looked close enough it looked like the scabs were made of little lines going all different directions (if that makes sense at all). I tried to pick at them but they would not come off. My arm was still sort of tingling, and it really just freaked me out.

It was probably around 6 or 7 in the morning, but I went running out to the living room where my mom fell asleep and I shook her awake. My arm felt so weird. I was crying and I told her about my dream and showed her my arm. She was pretty freaked out too. She ended up calling the doctors office right when they opened and got me an appointment that same day.

By the time we got in my arm didn’t hurt as bad, it just felt kind of tingly and numb. Our normal doctor came in and did a regular check up, nothing was unusual. She had no clue what the marks on my arm were. Through the course of an hour twelve more doctors came in and tried to figure out what they were. Some originally suggested they were spider-bites or cigarette burns, but they were all stumped after looking a bit more. Twelve doctors and we couldn’t get an answer.

For the next few days my mom kinda kept an eye on me. I stopped having nightmares, and after about a week or two I woke up and the marks were gone. There were three little white scars in their place, but they had completely disappeared. It’s been years and we still haven’t got a clue what they could’ve been. Probably the creepiest thing that’s happened to me, and I’ve always wondered if it’s ever happened to anyone else.

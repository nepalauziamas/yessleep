Part 4.

I dashed for the office door and grabbed at the handle.

The door rattled in the frame, but it wouldn't budge.

Everybody turned to look at the crazy guy screaming and frantically kicking and punching a door.

I turned around.

Most people looked shocked, others... not so much.

I felt like I could tell exactly who was real and who was not in that moment.

After about 15 seconds, two heavy set security officers were bounding towards me.

I had nowhere to run.

I didn't know what was going to happen.

I closed my eyes as they grabbed me, the darkest thoughts crossed my mind as I felt my feet dragging along the smooth tiled floor.

Thrown in a heap on the rough ground I heard cars and people talking, I opened my eyes and was genuinely surprised to find I had been ejected from the building and told not to come back.

I beat my head with my hands, 'Fuck, Fuck, Fuck!'

I sat on the tarmac just staring at the door.

'I'm so sorry Brian', I muttered to myself.

I sat there for 10 minutes, trying to calm myself down, staring at the door. 

Not a single person went in or came out.

I pulled my phone out and called my Mum as I grabbed my bike, I stood ready to go while the phone continued to ring.

I tried again, she answered almost immediately.

'Sorry, I was making tea, is everything okay?' She asked in a frantic voice.

'No, they're not, I'm coming to get you now, we need to get out of here as soon as possible!' Grab anything from Brian's we might need, food, bottles of water, weapons, anything you can find that might be of any use, I'll be there soon!' 

Cycling on a bike was in no way ideal, we would need to find a car or something.

My brakes squealed as I skidded almost into Brian's building, I ran inside to find my Mum sitting looking nervous, holding a bag.

'Everything we need is in here! Where's Brian?' She asked, looking behind me and out the window.

'Brian is... Brian disappeared, I think he got caught' I replied, not wanting to say too much.

She cupped her hand over her mouth, 'Oh God!'.

'We really need to go, this place isn't safe anymore!' 

My mum nodded and threw the bag over her back and we left to get on the bike.

I cycled to Shawn's house, seeing his car parked outside gave me some hope, surely his keys would still be inside.

All I have to do is just... go in!

'Stay here on the bike, stay hidden, if you see anyone, don't let them see you, don't make any noise, I'll be back in five minutes!'

She reluctantly agreed, looking at the ground.

'I'll be right back, I promise!'

She looked at me with sad eyes.

I turned and crossed the road, the wind slapped my face and clouds began to draw in.

Shawn's door looked splintered and cracked as if someone had been trying to break It down.

It was unlocked, surprisingly.

I opened the door and the smell reminded me of somewhere I'd rather be able to forget.

Hot musty air filled my lungs.

Walking quietly down the hall, every noise had me on edge.

The hall opened up into the living room at the end, it appeared to have been completely ransacked, everything was upturned and strewn across the floor.

Everything but the small coffee table in the center.

I tried to focus in the dim light, something was on the coffee table. 

It was Shawn's keys...

Immediately I felt threatened just by their presence, so perfectly placed in the middle, like were waiting on me.

Something else was happening here.

I lightly stepped over the stuff on the floor, looking all around me, waiting for something, but I didn't know what!

I picked up the keys, trying to stop them jangling in my hand.

I looked all around me again, still nothing there.

Carefully, I retraced my steps back to the hallway.

The hall seemed darker, I could barely see the end.

I could tell the door was still open.

The urge to sprint for it was mounting fast, but I still didn't want to make any noise.

Floorboards squeaked under my feet, my heart pounded every time I was approaching one of the doors leading into the rooms, they were all closed.

At any moment I expected one of them to burst open and for me to be dragged inside.

But nothing happened.

I made it to the door, and I left.

I triumphantly walked outside and unlocked the car.

Still feeling dubious, I made sure to check everywhere in the car and even under it before waving my Mum over.

She ditched the bike and climbed in the back seat and lay down with the bag.

This all seemed a little... too easy, Those keys were there for a reason, what that reason was, I wasn't giving a shit, the fact is, I now had a car and whatever it wanted me to do, if anything, I wasn't doing it.

I was getting my boot down and leaving Fort William behind.

I looked up to Shawn's window.

He was standing there looking out from the room I was in no less than a minute ago, waving at me with an evil looking grin.

I smiled back, and threw up my middle finger at him just as I hit the accelerator.

'DANNY WATCH OUT!', my Mum cried.

I slammed on the brakes.

Ashwin and Dennis were standing in the middle of the road, only a few feet from the car, laughing.

Their jagged facial features contorted and twisted to almost resemble the clown in a way.

It was then I noticed they were actually wearing the clown's outfit, they began taking steps towards us.

Their arms and fingers grew longer and more pointed.

I pulled the car into reverse and slammed my foot down.

In my rear view I saw my Dad, his massive form seemed to have grown out of control, like he could barely carry himself.

He staggered along the road, cracking the asphalt beneath him with each step, the road itself burned and crumbled under him.

I stopped the car again, I had enough room to manoeuvre around the other two, not so much my Dad.

I threw it into gear and started screaming along the road, I had the urge to just hit them but I didn't want to damage the car.

Maybe that's what they wanted, their smiles grew wider as I approached, the urge was building.

Just before I was about to make some Ash and Dennis bolognese, I turned the steering wheel and rounded them without incident.

My Mum screamed and we were on our way.

The streets were almost empty, there were some normal looking people around but not many, maybe only a few cars and vans.

I stopped and took out my phone.

I opened maps and found the nearest city was Glasgow, 74 miles.

The plan was, get there, get a hotel and just try to forget about Fort William, start again somewhere else, there was nothing I could do anymore, the town seemed to be dead as if everyone had left or... something worse.

'Do you need anything from the bag, anything to eat or drink?', my Mum asked from the back seat. 

'No, I'm too anxious, we just need to get out of here, we're going to Glasgow to stay in a hotel for a couple of nights, we'll see what happens from there!'

'Do you mind if I sleep? I'm drained son!' She said with her eyes already closed.

'That's fine, we should be there in a couple of hours!' I told her, starting the engine back up.

That feeling of seeing the sign, *You are now leaving Fort William* gave me shivers, I couldn't look back now. 

I might be labelled a coward or a bad friend, but there's literally nothing I can do, I can't go and seal the door myself, I can't save anyone now but myself and my Mum.

The Drive was over so fast, no stops, nothing, it was almost 10pm when we pulled into a Premier Inn car park.

The city was bright and busy, hundreds of people just walking around everywhere not giving one solitary fuck about anyone or anything else.

We must have looked like we had been dragged backwards through hell. 

We made our way to the reception to check in.

The guy at the desk was called Brian... it genuinely crushed me, even just seeing his name, and to think what might have happened to him in that room.

'Just two rooms please, any two rooms!' I said, my voice sounded coarse.

'Certainly sir, do you prefer the rooms near each other?' He replied with a warm, inviting smile.

'Just anything, if there's two near each other then, yeah, but it doesn't really matter', I was trying to be as polite as possible despite how exhausted I was, I needed to get to bed and rest.

The receptionist charged my card and promptly handed over two key cards and directed us to our rooms.

2 floors up, and both rooms right next to each other.

I threw the bag over my shoulder and my Mum put her arm round me, she seemed unsteady and also exhausted like myself.

We got to her room where I took her in and helped her onto the bed.

'Get some sleep, if you can, we'll figure out what we're doing tomorrow'.

She just nodded and lay back with her eyes already closed.

I quietly left her room and went to mine.

It was nice and cold, fresh! I turned on the TV, chucked the bag on the floor then went straight into the shower.

The water felt amazing, I felt like I had been running a marathon through mud and the piping hot shower was relaxing every single muscle in my body. 

After my shower I put on some shorts and a t-shirt.

I lay back a let out a long overdue exhale, the stress and anxiety drained from my body and mind and I finally felt like I could breathe normally.

I put on the news to see if anything was being reported on, but nothing. 

I did a Google search, checked Facebook, Twitter! Not a single post or article about Fort William.

I can't quite say how I felt about that.

Listening to BBC News 24, my eyes began feeling heavy.

I sank deeper into my pillow.

.

.

I was on a bike.

Cycling through the streets of Fort William.

An intense feeling of Dèja Vu overcame me.

I saw flashes of images, like a strobe effect or possibly even a lightning storm.

It was raining.

I saw the bell tower.

The ground beneath heaved as if it were breathing, its breathing was in time with my own.

I felt drawn to the tower.

I saw an image of Liam's emaciated body on the floor of the fifth floor.

The door to the bell tower was slamming with force.

It broke.

The splintered wood got sucked inside and a deafening roar emanated from the building.

The bells began to ring.

I saw Shawn's face grinning from his living room window and waving me off.

I saw Shawn's car keys on the small square table.

Ash and Dennis smashing my Dad's car as his dead body lay inside almost torn apart.

I cycled on, and on.

The bells getting louder and louder as the rain got heavier.

I suddenly realised where I was.

I was cycling to Brian's house.

As his house came into view, Brian's face was pressed against the window, he saw me and waved over.

I saw my Mum's head behind him, peeking over his shoulder.

She was smiling.

Her eyes began to glow like two fiery beacons and black veins became visible on her face.

Brian had no idea.

The bells rang even louder, my ears could barely withstand the noise.

I stopped dead on the bike.

Rain poured down my face as I just stared at them.

.

I woke up with a start to knocking on my room door.

I was soaked in sweat.

The bells were still chiming. 

They grew louder as I checked my phone.

Midnight.

Another knock at the door.

'Danny, it's me!' My Mum called, 'can you hear the bells? Please let me in Danny I'm scared'.

I got out of the bed and hastily walked to the door.

I grabbed the door handle.

Then I stopped myself.

I remembered her standing behind Brian with that grotesque face.

I looked out the peephole.

She was standing a couple of feet back.

Her face was twisted and jagged, it looked like it was melting.

She raised her hand and waved with her long black pointed fingers sporting talon like claws.

'There you are!' She grinned, her voice getting noticeably deeper.

She knew I was looking.

I took a step back from the door.

Feeling panicked, my breathing rate increased dramatically.

*Bang Bang Bang* 

The door shook, the ground shook.

'Let me in, son, it's time! There's nowhere to run now!'

Her voice sounded demonic and guttural.

I continued walking backwards until I tripped fell onto the bed.

'The bag!' I said to myself, realising what I tripped on, thinking there could be something useful inside.

I opened it.

It was just packed full of polaroids, they spilled out all over the floor, pictures of everyone, Liam Shawn, my parents, Ash, Dennis, Brian.

All of them shackled to the beds from that room on the first floor, being tortured and their bodies being ripped to shreds.

Pictures of me in various locations within the tower, and in the streets.

A picture of...

Of the keys on Shawn's table.

The fucking keys!

It wanted me to take the keys!

I thought I was getting away when all along, it wanted me to take it somewhere else... and I've just drove it to the biggest City in Scotland!

What have I done!?

I sat slumped on the floor.

Nowhere to hide now.

The door is beginning to break and it's only a matter of time before it gives way, I can see the cracks appearing all over.

If this is the last thing I ever write, then I want this to be a warning to every one of you.

Do not ever go to Fort William, under any circumstances!

For your own sake, stay away.

If there's anyone reading this right now.

Should you ever find yourself in Scotland, I recommend you pay a visit to my home town of Fort William.

If you are interested, we can even arrange to meet up...

I have loads to show you.

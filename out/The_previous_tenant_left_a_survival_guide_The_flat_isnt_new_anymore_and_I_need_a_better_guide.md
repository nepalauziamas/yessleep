It’s been a long time since I moved into this apartment, picked up that damn note from the tenant before me and unlocked a world of demon window cleaners and vile, rat-like creatures that live in the communal lift. 

If you don’t know me, my name is Kat and months ago I found myself living in a home filled with unusual occurrences, you can [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ci94do/the_previous_tenant_of_my_new_flat_left_a/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) if you want to know more. If any of you do remember me, I’m back again, begging for your help.

I don’t even really know how to begin this but I think I owe you all an apology. You warned me, gave me advice and tried to stop me from making the biggest damn mistake of my life. I didn’t listen. Instead, I let my emotional immaturity get the better of me. I really wish I’d listened. 

I’m sorry I ghosted you all. I was embarrassed. I know I disappeared without a word and for that I really am sorry. I can’t blame any of you for comparing me to Prudence. 

The events following my moving into the block had me in such an emotional place. You have to understand, it was a lot to take in, no one can be truly equipped to live somewhere like this, it was bound to catch up with me eventually. 

The months since I last updated you have been hellish and now I’ve found myself in further trouble. It wasn’t long after my last post that I caught Jamie. I enticed him into the flat with cat food left out by the door. I ran the risk of being mauled alive by the remaining lift creatures to capture my monstrosity of a boyfriend. 

He was smaller than I thought. I expected him to be much larger than Lyla because of the age difference, but he wasn’t. Maybe as big as a large dog. Something I missed about Jamie more than anything was his once huge stature, an odd quality to consider, I know, but he was 6’3 and his cuddles felt like the safest place I’d ever been. 

Looking at the small, deformed, humanoid creature, hunched over, crunching on cat biscuits with its sharp, jagged teeth tucked under a grotesque rodent nose made me feel sick. I instantly knew that I’d made a mistake, that the love of my life was gone for good, but *that thing* had Jamie’s eyes, they were unmistakable. 

Suddenly Prudence’s need to keep Lyla around made sense. I could see an entire life in those eyes that had been ripped away from me and I was too selfish to let it go. I suppose in that respect I’m exactly like her. Exactly what you all think. A monster. 

I fashioned a place to keep him hidden in the large built in wardrobe of our bedroom. It wasn’t like Lyla’s cage was - cold and restrictive - it had space, lights and photos of us before everything happened. 

It was like a walk in wardrobe, ironically it was something that originally attracted me to the flat. The only similarity to Lyla’s tiny cage was the large padlock that secured it. 

I tried everything to bring that little piece of Jamie left inside the creature out, I really did. I sat with him for hours, talking about our lives, reminiscing and trying to feed him his favourite meals. He would make awful raspy noises when I spoke to him at first; grunting and wheezing as if he were struggling to breathe. 

I received more than a few bites and scratches and he refused to eat anything that I gave him, opting for scraps instead. 

I thought about killing him. A lot. It’s a position I never thought I’d be in when we were searching for a home together and at some point I realised I consider it daily. I’ve come close to attempting it more than a few times but every time I look at those damn eyes I can’t. I’m weak.

So I’ve tried to cope. I’ve taken the best care of him that I can. I’ve gotten involved with my neighbours, I babysat Terri’s twins twice a week at her place while she slept and I’m actively involved in the residents committee. 

I never told anyone what I did, aside from all of you. There’s only two people I feel I could admit my mistakes to; one was locked in my wardrobe, whilst the other was seemingly gone forever. 

Despite this, I kept the garden immaculate in the hope that one day Derek would return and it kept me sane. I even managed to revive one of the shrubs that Prudence tried to butcher during her attack, but no matter how much love I gave, it just wouldn’t flourish and the bench remained empty. 

All this whilst I kept my deepest shame in my bedroom cupboard. 

Regardless of all the anguish this place has bought me there’s nowhere else in the world I would consider home anymore. I’ve never felt more connected to a place in my life. So I’ve stayed, I’ve coped and I kept busy. 

The tower block may be special, and it’s residents may often live in another world but we weren’t completely immune to the outside. Government lockdown hit us recently too. With lockdown came the loss of routine as we knew it. 

The whole building went into chaos and I was no exception. Being trapped in the flat with *him* all day undid months worth of self distraction and denial in a matter of hours. I’d never been more aware of what  an abhorrent thing I’d done than those first few weeks.

The other residents were going through their own crises. Terri hadn’t slept in weeks, we FaceTimed regularly and I missed her and the kids terribly, every time I spoke to her she looked awful. There was wailing at night, banging at all hours of the day and a whole buildings worth of inhabitants struggling. 

When they deemed window cleaning non essential it sent that *particular pest* into chaos; he still appeared on the balconies but instead of the relentless niceties he just scratched desperately at the window. I tried not to open the curtains I finally got round to buying a few months ago, I couldn’t take his pleading eyes. 

The residents committee tried to put things in place to keep the block going. We were running zoom meetings and a number of us started collecting essentials for the elderly and vulnerable residents of our floors. Having socially distanced chats with them from the corridor as we drop off. To be honest, it was as much a lifeline for me as the elderly residents... anything to get out of the flat, away from him.

I was allocated three residents from my floor, living in flats 48, 51 and 43. 

Percy and Sylvia live in flat 43, they’re next door to me and generally very pleasant. Sylvia has a breathing problem so they had to isolate. They’re older, but very independent, most of the time they just needed a few essentials and didn’t want to chat. 

Mr Prentice from flat 48 was easy too, he’d been an intensely private man since I’d known him and lockdown hadn’t changed that. He did seem to make more of the animalistic noises I’d come to know him for, but I think being trapped inside would do that to anyone with his particular afflictions. Since he trampled Prudence I’d been much more tolerant of the sounds anyway. 

The only thing I really learned about him from doing his shopping is that he loves a drink and there’s often a bottle of whiskey in the bag he carries home with his newspaper inside. 

Once a week he asked me to drop off an envelope of cash to the pub he drinks in, *The Pickled Gnome*. He said that the owner is a good friend and he worries about her getting by financially with the pub shut at the moment. It warmed my heart. He’s such a lovely man. 

Flat 51 was different from the other two. I hadn’t ever met the occupant, despite having lived here for almost a year now. I’d seen a young man going in and out occasionally but he never stayed long. 

The flat was occupied by Ms Esther Beckman, a blind, elderly widow. The man visiting was her son, who had his own profoundly disabled child and couldn’t support his mother through the pandemic. 

The first time I knocked on her door I was nervous. I wasn’t sure why, I just felt uncomfortable trying to help someone I knew nothing about. I knocked and stood back, it took a few moments for Ms Beckman to answer. 

Esther had wild greyed hair, she hadn’t cut it like most older ladies tend to, she’d allowed it to grow and it had formed spectacular waves. She was well presented and I’m embarrassed to say I didn’t expect that from a blind person. She wore a satin blue dressing gown over the top of a white day dress and had a pair of comfortable looking slippers on, that perfectly matched the colour of her dressing gown. 

“Are you the girl Molly phoned about? I told her I’m fine but the interfering old bat insisted.” She greeted me with, rummaging in the pocket of her dressing gown for a packet of cigarettes, I watched her open the pack and light the last one. 

Her brash attitude didn’t put me off, I liked people with a bit of tenacity and I wasn’t particularly fond of the residents committee’s chairperson, Molly Thompson, either. 

“I’m Kat. Although I’m sure Molly will have referred to me as Katherine... not my name by the way. Anyway, I’m happy to pick up anything that you need, and I’m here if you just want to chat.” I stumbled a little as I spoke. Esther laughed.

“See, even interfering in something as personal as your name. I never liked that woman.” She paused and took a few drags of her cigarette, hesitating before she continued.

“I don’t need much. If you could grab me a pack of cigarettes and a microwave meal every day I’m fine. I don’t like to ask, but my son can’t come and without a smoke I think I’d go potty.” She took another long drag of her cigarette and reached into her pocket to pull out some change and a twenty pound note. She winced a little as she asked for help, it clearly wasn’t something she was used to. 

“Throw me the packet, so I know which brand to get.” I answered. 

Ester threw me the empty carton after shoving her money inside and I barely caught it. She smoked the same brand I did so I reached into my pocket and pulled out 3 or 4 individual cigs and tossed them back. They hit the floor. Shit. She’s blind, I thought, mortified. 

“There’s a few cig’s on the floor in front of you... sorry... I didn’t think. But they’re the same as yours, they should keep you going until I get back.” As I said that she smiled properly for the first time. 

“You’re alright, aren’t you. Thanks. Before you go, just a bit of advice for you, take the route through the park instead of round.” She answered. 

I thought it was strange but everything in the tower was. I told her that I would and said my goodbyes. The stairs that constantly skipped weren’t kind to me that trip, the 7 flights became 18 and by the time I reached the bottom my thighs were burning. 

I exited the building and thought about Esthers suggestion. The route around the park was quicker, but I decided a pleasant wander through the trees would only keep me away from Jamie for longer so without any further hesitation I took her advice. My legs were sore from the stairs but it was a beautiful day. 

About halfway through the park I heard a loud crash and the screeching of car tyres followed by screaming. I sped up and when I finally reached the exit I turned the corner towards the shop and the source of the noise. It was utter carnage. A car had slammed into a motorbike at a zebra crossing and caused a devastating accident. Crowds gathered, with multiple people on the phone to emergency services.

I was shaken entering the shop, I couldn’t stop thinking about the poor people involved in the crash. Esthers words echoed in my mind as I thought about the fact that had I taken the usual route I would have probably been crossing at the crash site as it happened. 

The realisation that Ms Beckman’s suggestion had saved my life sent my mind into overdrive. I know that many of you think I learned nothing from my experiences moving into the block, but I did learn that there are no coincidences here. She had known exactly what was going to happen. 

I left the shop and chose to go back through the park, I was leaving nothing to chance, but it frustrated me that I couldn’t get back home quicker. When I reached the building I flung the main door open and started to climb the stairs. They must have sensed my urgency, because they only made me climb 4 flights this time. 

I stared at the numbers on the flat door. 51. Why had I never met her before? Why had she been hiding in her flat? I placed the shopping bag close to the door, rapped hard on it with my knuckles and shouted.

“Ms Beckman!” A few moments passed. I knocked again. 

“Give me a chance to open the door Kat. And please. It’s Essie. Or would you prefer I called you Katherine?” She opened the door and replied, scoffing as she said Katherine. 

“How did you know?” I demanded.

“Know what?”

“You know what. You saved my life. The crash!” 

“I didn’t save your life. I knew that if you walked around the park you’d be in trouble. I had no idea there would be a crash, I just made a suggestion. You saved your own life when you took it.” She said flippantly. 

“So you can see the future?” I asked, desperate for answers. 

“Don’t you dare! Blind woman... second sight. My whole life the residents of this block have tried to reduce me to a walking cliche and I’m not doing it anymore! I don’t *see* anything, I’ve been blind since birth. I’ve just always had a particularly accurate instinct.” She spoke with passion. I could see why she locked herself away, if the other residents knew about her talents I’m sure she was hounded. 

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend you. I haven’t been here long, these things still surprise me. Thank you for sharing your instinct. I would’ve been squished if you didn’t.” 

“Well I’m glad you weren’t.” She reached down and picked up the shopping bag, taking out the packet of cigarettes to open and light one. “Thanks for this, she said rustling the bag with her fingers. What flat do you live in?”

“Number 42.” I answered. Essie beamed. 

“Hah! I overheard someone saying that the old witch was dead but I wasn’t sure I believed them. I thought Prudence Hemmings would ride out a nuclear apocalypse like the cockroach she was.” I cringed at the sound of her name. I try not to think about her too much, or what she put me through. I try to focus on what I love about the block. Essie could tell she struck a nerve. “Did I hit a sore point?” She continued, noting my discomfort. 

“I wasn’t a fan of Prudence either. The idea of her coming back with cockroach antennae’s in the night will keep me awake now.” I answered, trying to lighten the mood. 

“You’re funny. If antenna would’ve benefitted that woman she’d have done anything to grow them. It’s nice to have some young blood in this place. It was all starting to get a bit old and stale. Take care Kat.” We said our goodbyes and she closed the door. 

That night I thought about Essie. I imagined introducing her to the twins, I was sure she would love them, and I thought of trying to get her involved in the block again when all this was over. It made me smile. Unfortunately, my happy thoughts were soon interrupted by Jamie. 

I sat on my bed with a cup of tea and could hear him from the cupboard, scratching and wheezing. I went and opened it up to stroke him a few times. Saliva dripped from his sharp teeth down his deformed jaw. It disgusted me. 

I shut my eyes and tried to imagine my once gorgeous boyfriend, arms round me on the mattress on the floor of the flat for the one night that we got to spend here together. I wished every day to go back to that, but it would never happen. When I opened my eyes there he was... that *monster.*

I got close to Essie over those first few weeks. I got her cigarettes and a microwave meal every day and we chatted at the door. After a few days I was taking my morning cup of tea to sit in the corridor and talk to her. I started making enough food for two so that she could have something home cooked. She hated my lasagna, but she was grateful. 

She had lost her husband young, not long after she had her son and never dated again. Her life was fascinating. She’d spent years as a social worker before she retired. She said that her instinct helped her give great advice to her clients and she’d managed to help a lot of people out of bad situations. Essie may have been older, but she was full of life. 

I asked her why I never saw her, why she never came to committee meetings or got involved. As I suspected, she’d grown sick of the whole block hounding her for predictions about their lives. She told me that once Molly had begged her to tell her the gender of her unborn grandchild before the child’s mother had found out so that she could hold it over her. 

It sounded like it got intense. People were offering to pay for the winning lottery numbers, or the bank details of Bill Gates. They didn’t want to listen when she tried to tell them that it wasn’t how it worked; so she kept a distance, saw her son and that was about it. 

It made me sad, I vowed that even after this lock down was over I was going to keep spending time with Essie. I didn’t want to think of anyone hauled up at home all the time without anyone to talk to. I told Terri about her, and she remembered Essie being friends with her parents while she was growing up. Terri told me she’d been a resident forever.

I dropped Essie’s shopping at the door and sat down in the corridor to chat as usual one afternoon. We spoke about music and her love of Jazz. It was pleasant. Just before I left she stopped me and told me that she had an instinct that she needed to tell me about. It was unusual, she didn’t like to share them and I didn’t like to pester, but she insisted it was important. 

“Kat, one of your friends needs help. You need to know that it is possible, it won’t be easy but if you look hard enough you will find a way.”

That was all she said. She claimed it was all she knew, but I think Essie liked to hold things back sometimes. Either way it was cryptic and confusing. I lamented her for it.

“That’s all your giving me? What am I supposed to do with that?” I quizzed her. 

“Haven’t got a fucking clue.” She replied lighting yet another cigarette. “I got an instinct and I told you. What more do you want? There’s others in this block that would kill for one of Essie Beckman’s famous instincts.” She laughed and flipped her wild hair mockingly. 

I sat in the corridor outside hers for a while, even after she closed the door. I thought about what her instinct could mean.

When I finally gathered up the stomach to enter my flat I thought of Jamie. What if it meant I could help him? What if what I’d done was reversible? What if there was hope? 

Or maybe it meant that killing him really was the only way I could help him, and if I  looked at myself hard enough I’d finally find the strength to follow through. 

I struggled to sleep that night despite trying to go to bed early. Every scratch, wheeze and gasp from the cupboard sent me bolt upright and it took until just after 1am before I finally drifted off.

When I woke in the morning I had 5 missed calls from Terri, 2 from 3am and 3 from that morning. My heart dropped. The kids. I knew Ellie had been going through a stage of trying to get out of the flat and I was terrified something had happened to her. 

I could barely hold the phone as I dialled back. Thankfully, she answered quickly. 

“Terri! Are you ok? What’s happened? Are the kids ok?” I practically screamed at her down the microphone. 

“Kat. I’m fine, we’re fine! But I have to tell you something.” Terri was serious, she was never serious. 

“What is it?”

“Last night, Ellie got out. She made it all the way up to your floor to try and visit you by the time I caught up with her. As I was about to march her downstairs I spotted something. It’s Ms Beckman, Kat....She was walking into the lift.” Her words cut into my soul. I let out a gentle sob. 

“I’m sorry Kat. I tried to stop her, I screamed her name but she didn’t turn. She just walked in. I couldn’t do anymore, I had Ellie there and when I checked the time.... it was quarter past 2. I’m so sorry.” 

And that’s where this predicament begins, in an ironically similar place to before, with me [mourning the loss of a loved one to the lift.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePickledGnome/comments/g1pldj/the_story_so_far/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Most of you will think I'm crazy, honestly I feel like I'm going a little crazy too.When I was sixteen my parents got me a dog. He was a German Shepard husky mix and was the sweetest dog on the planet. When I turned twenty and moved out of my parents home he came with me of course. He had been by my side through everything. When I finally got my new home I could tell immediately I was going to have a problem with my dog. I lived in the country and in my backyard it's an open field that goes into a large section of woods. I've had to practically fight my dog on not going into the woods but something seems to attract him. I had decided to keep him on a leash when I brought him outside at night. During the day I wasn't so worried about it since I could see him clearly and even if he ran into the woods I would be able to see him. Well, the other night my dog was barking and scratching at the door. I took out my leash and brought him outside. Almost immediately my dog started pulling towards the woods. I yelled at him, telling him no but he didn't listen which was unusual. I kept on yelling at him and pulling him back, he was getting more and more aggressive which was worrying me. He was seeing something I couldn't. I was afraid of it being a dangerous animal or a person, so I started to pull him back to the back door. In the middle of pulling him the leash snapped and my dog darted for the woods. 

Me, trying to hold him back, the second it snapped I went crashing onto the floor. My head hit the floor hard to the point my vision was blurry and my ears were somewhat ringing. When I finally came to I witnessed my dog entering the woods at full blast. I quickly got up and ran after him. I couldn't see him but I followed his barks. But slowly his barks faded and I was left alone in the middle of the woods, calling to him but with no answer. I decided to run back to my house to get a flashlight and call my dad for help. 

 called him and he told me to wait until the morning to go after him since he was going after something clearly dangerous. He said he'd come over the next day to help. I agreed and tried to sleep but I couldn't even get an hour of sleep, half an hour if I was lucky.  When my dad finally made it I didn't waste any time and went into the woods. We searched for hours but couldn't find him. We finally decided to head back home and have some lunch. While eating my dad looked out the window and his eyes widened. "Oh my god." He mumbles and I look out the window. My dog was coming out of the woods, panting. I shot up and ran outside, hugging my dog and crying. It wasn't until I pulled away that I realized there was something wrong. 

I looked at my dog and his eyes looked... Unusual. Almost too alive. I was in such shock that I didn't even realize the putrid smell coming from my dog, he smelled like death. His fur was disgusting, a sticky white substance stuck in his fur which smelled like spit, his fur was also extremely dirty. I brought him inside and my dad plugged his nose. "Jesus Christ what the hell happened to him?" My dad says and I shrug, not understanding either. I then decided to give him a bath later that night, I said goodbye to my dad and thanks for the help before he left. In a cheery voice I got down to my dog's level and asked if he wanted a bath. He loved baths and got excited if I even mentioned it.... 

But he didn't react, his creepy eyes just stared back at me. I went to pet him but when I did he tried to bite my hand, his teeth bearing and an evil growl rumbled through his throat. I looked at him afraid before standing up and quickly walking to my bedroom, shutting the door. There was something wrong with my dog, I didn't know what. I decided to lock my door and go to bed. I ended up waking up to him scratching and whining at my door, which wasn't uncommon but it just felt... Off. The next day I went into the living room and my dog was in a ball in the corner of the room asleep. I went on with my day and the smell got worse. I decided to give my dog a bath whether he liked it or not. I

 led him into the bathroom and put him in the bathtub. He just sat there while I washed him off with the shower hose. I ran my fingers through his long hair but my fingers were stopped by a knot, my dog had no reaction. I looked at it closely and it was a huge patch of hair that was stuck together. I cringed, looking at it closer. It was stuck together with blood. I finally untangled the hair but now I wish I didn't. I now wish I had just left him alone and dealt with the smell..

Now here is where none of you are going to believe me.. To be honest I wouldn't believe me either. when I pulled back the hair I saw a zipper going up and down its back. "What the fuck." I said out loud. My dog then started to growl. I slowly got up and took some steps back. My dog then jumped out of the tub and growled at me even louder. I started to say prayers under my breath until my back hit the wall. Suddenly my dog stood up on its fucking hind legs. HIS. HIND. LEGS. He then walked towards me and I mentally said 'nope' and ran off into my living room. 

I grabbed my keys and ran outside, I could hear it running after me. I got into my car, locking it behind me. The dog was barking at my door window and I turned my car on and shot out of my drive way. I looked back at my home and I saw my dog sitting on my steps, he was staring at me, panting and a grin on its face. I quickly drove off, I made it to my parents house and I was too afraid to even say exactly what happened, I just said 'there's *something* in my house'. My dad called the cops and half an hour later he came to me and sat me down. He explained to me that someone completely trashed my house, everything was destroyed and my dog was gone. A couple hours later the police sat us both down and explained something that made me psychically ill.

The police said they found my dog in the woods, they said he'd been dead for a couple of days. But that's not what terrified me. That's not what made me turn over and throw up...

My dog was found without his skin.

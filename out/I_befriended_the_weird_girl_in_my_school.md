Ever since I noticed her she sat alone in the cafeteria, everyday. I’ve always wondered why, and I guess curiosity got the best out of me. I sat besides her one day, and she didn’t seem to mind. Since then I sat with her everyday, she didn’t talk much, but she was nice. I learned that her name was Lilith, she also loved music, but I could’ve guessed that earlier based on the fact she was always sitting with her headphones on.
 
I got a few weird stares since I started talking to her, and my friends seemed to distance themselves from me a bit, but it was no big deal. I would’ve asked someone, but I didn’t bother and didn’t want to end up getting some personal stories to why people dislike her. 
 
After a few months me and Lily got closer, I didn’t really think much about how people didn’t like her and just assumed that some stupid rumours got spread, like what happened most of the time. I mean there was nothing weird about her as far as I knew? She dressed nicely, always wearing cute pink or white dresses or skirts, her long black hair always brushed perfectly, sometimes she wore a ribbon in it too. Her house was also really nice, she had a big house, and her room was decorated with band posters and posters of idols. The walls of her room were light pink, and there were stuffed animals and cute dolls laying around everywhere. I just never saw anyone else home with her, while I wouldn’t say she lived alone based in the furniture and just how everything looked. She was also really smart, always helped me with my homework. 
 
After a while of knowing her I did notice she sometimes looked really tired, a concerning type of tired, and it only seemed to get worse. At some point I let all my worries about her go, until I was at this party hosted by a few of my friends. Some random drunk guy came up to me. “Hey aren’t you friends with that Lily witch?” he asked. “Uh yeah sure, why? You got a problem with that?” “Haha, you’re definitely ending up like her dog.” After that interaction the guy wandered off, and I didn’t see him anymore. I tried to shake it off but couldn’t, what did he mean by that? Lily didn’t even have a dog. It was such a silly thing to worry about, but I couldn’t let it go. 
 
My concerns only grew bigger this one day that I went over to her house to study. I forgot my pen and asked her to borrow one. She told me to grab it from the left drawer in her desk. I’m not the smartest guy out there and opened the right one by accident, only to find lots of empty syringes. I was startled by this finding and quickly slammed the drawer shut. I grabbed a pen and sat back on the floor with her. She wasn’t really paying attention but I’m pretty sure she noticed. I hurried with finishing the work and went home. 
 
I spend that whole day questioning what I saw over at Lily’s house. Was she sick? She never told me about anything like that. She would’ve told me right? Was she an addict perhaps? Maybe I shouldn’t overthink this too, having syringes isn’t that big of a deal right? There’s lots of reasons for that. Although the fact that people were already acting weird regarding her raised suspicions I had. Maybe I should just ask her? I mean she trusts me obviously? She seemed to be really honest with me, also really attached, she always wanted to hang out and come along whenever I went out. She even gave me the key to her house so I could come over whenever I felt like without invitation, and she never seemed to mind. I still decided to not bring it up, I didn’t want to make her uncomfortable.
 
I kept hanging out with her and started suspecting that she was in love with me, when I found out she had a boyfriend. I was looking over her shoulder on her phone while she got a message from “Honey🍬💗”, it said “Hello cutie, are you still free this Friday?”. I immediately yelled out “You have a boyfriend?!?!” because that was the last thing I expected. “It’s just a friend haha.” I didn’t believe her, but why would she lie to me? I couldn’t help but feel a little jealous and I wasn’t sure why.
 
I decided I would go over to her house on Friday, if she didn’t lie I could meet this friend, if she did I would call her out for that. I felt like a creep doing it but proceeded my plan. I wish I hadn’t. When I entered her house that evening I was met with a pleasant surprise, Lily was there in the living room, with someone else. Only I’m pretty sure this someone wasn’t alive, and Lily was eating him. She looked up at me and I froze, she looked unfazed and kept chewing. My hand reached out to my pocket, searching for my phone. I didn’t have it on me. 
 
I ran home, which was even more stupid. There I grabbed my phone and while I was dialling 911 again I froze. I should’ve just alarmed a neighbour, no? There was someone being murdered, and I didn’t react. I’m definitely going to seem suspicious, I don’t wanna go to jail. Lily’s still my friend, should I be doing this? Was I really trying to let such bad of a crime go unreported? Was I really defending a murderer? As all these thoughts flooded my head I replayed the scene in my head: the man’s shocked live-less expression, Lily staring at me with those big dark puppy eyes, the blood leaking from the corner of her mouth. That couldn’t have been real right? It was a dark winter evening and life was already feeling surreal, this made it 100x worse. 
 
I ended up making the worst decision ever: I convinced myself I was crazy and swore to never tell anyone. I didn’t see or hear from Lilith for a few months after that, but I’ve been getting letters from her since a few weeks now, I haven’t dared to open them yet, I don’t want to. I just want to run away from all this pressure, but I can’t. I also recently received a message from an unknown number that’s been calling: “Hi honey <3”. I’ve blocked the caller. I feel watched. I don’t know what to do anymore but I think I am going crazy, maybe it was all my imagination and I should admit myself to a mental hospital. Or maybe she wants me to think like that.

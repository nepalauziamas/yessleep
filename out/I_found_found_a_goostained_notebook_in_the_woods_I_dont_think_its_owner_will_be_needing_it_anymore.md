*There’s a stretch of grassland past the woods near my house where I like to go and relax after a stressful day. The low-lying grass looks really cool when the wind sweeps through it, and the whole area is very serene and calming, especially at night; since there aren’t any trees to block the moonlight. I usually go and lie there for an hour or two, listening to the breeze and the animals and just...decompressing. Well, after a particularly grueling ten-hour shift at work (I had asked for it, admittedly, taking the shift of another coworker), I went there tonight. Only this time I found something strange, something I wouldn’t have been able to explain, had there not been a handy explanation provided for it. It was a small journal, bound in black leather, only most of its surface was covered by a white goo that, somehow, glowed.*  

*Additionally, there were the small, mushed or trampled bodies of what looked like demonic bugs lying all around the journal—all of which were as white as the goo. But I’ve never in my life seen any bugs like those, and something about them—even crushed and smooshed as they were—made me feel deeply uncomfortable; unsafe, even. Going back to the journal...* 

*The first few pages consisted of short poems, and seeing as how I’ve neither read nor written any serious poetry, I can’t say whether or not they’re any good. But about forty pages in, a story begins, and it’s this that I’ve transcribed to share. I’m not a writer, I couldn’t hope to give a proper synopsis of its events, so I’ll share the whole thing here, with the only omission being a poem near its end – and I’ll explain my reasons for leaving it out when it appears in the narrative.* 

*The story:*  

I’m not exactly sure what to do now. I figure I have maybe 45 minutes or an hour before I’m overtaken—so until then, I guess I’ll tell my story. I don’t have any friends or family, not anyone significant, so there’s no one I can call, no one with whom I could speak to for comfort, or closure. So, I’ll just write. I guess you could call it fate that I had, at the very last moment, decided to bring my notebook with me.  

Earlier, around 8am this morning, I’d been lying in bed, thinking of what to do on my unplanned day off—I'd been asked to swap shifts with another coworker, and generously agreed—when I received a notification on my phone from a community social app I hadn’t used in a while. The notification informed me about a concert in the area, free and open to all attendees, pending any capacity restraints. I figured I’d attend, having nothing else better to do, and prepared to head out.  

While walking to the front door of my apartment, I had the sudden idea to bring my notebook to write, in case I arrived early, or if the concert wrapped up before I’d grown tired of being out. I had—unsuccessfully, I’ll admit—been trying to write and publish poetry and prose poems, for the last few weeks. I’d bought a small and inexpensive leather notebook for such a purpose, and fetched it front my bedside table to bring along with me.  

The concert, announced to be held at a nearby park—within walking distance, even—had not yet started; the stage crew and band members still setting up the make-shift venue in the public event section of the sprawling park grounds. I wandered around for a while, trying both to draw inspiration from nature and get some much-needed exercise. In my endeavors to become something of a poet, I’d grown fairly weak, apathetically sedentary—not to say that there’s any correlation between the poetry and physical unfitness, but only that I hadn’t done much beyond read and write within my dingy little apartment for the preceding few months.  

Finally, the concert started, and I found a nice spot from which to view and listen to the performances. The bands were mostly indie rock and folk, and the attendees were representative of what I would’ve imagined the average fan of that music to look like. Despite not really being into that music or “scene”, I found myself enjoying the concert, and feeling, for the first time in a while, content with life, simply but deeply entertained.  

I spoke to no one—having nothing in common beyond a presence at the event—but smiled and waved and politely stood by many people, as the moderately populated crowd continuously shifted with the coming and goings of attendees. Overall, it was a fun, much-needed experience, and although I didn’t do anything in the way of socializing, I nonetheless felt that I had grown a little closer with my community.  

When the concert ended and I had drifted away from the lawn, I realized that I didn’t want to return home; wanted instead to spend a little more time outside, although my desire to be around people had by this point waned considerably. So, being in a public park with no curfew, I decided to wander deeper into the less-populated areas, and write—if possible—by the soft light of the dawning moon.  

Almost giddy from a sudden excitement at being out among nature at night, I followed the main path that wound throughout the park until I came to the simply fenced area where it ended, though the signage and mapped trails continued. Staying along this course, I ventured farther until the trees, hulking and broadly boughed, resembled little the artificially planted and carefully maintained vegetation of the former grounds. I hadn’t known beforehand that the park actually bled into a proper woodland area, but quickly surmised this when I began to see—but mostly hear—the activity of wild nocturnal animals as they began their inverted days.  

Strangely, my excitement began to steadily diminish, and I felt in its place the glacial dawning of a vague anxiety, as if I on some instinctual or unconscious level sensed an impending threat. There was no course left to follow, only the seemingly untrodden floor of the woods, littered with fallen leaves, branches, rocks, and the still-steaming waste of newly arisen animals. Still, there was nothing in the way of a tangible threat; no signs or evidence of a prowling predator, or any natural hazard of some kind. Lacking these clear indicators of trouble, and wanting to continue on, I ignored the source-less anxiety and allowed the lunar light to guide me deeper into the woods.  

I eventually reached a sort of hill, down from which ran a rocky declivity, and at the base of which was a broad swath of grass: a plain or massive lawn, so openly moonlit that it appeared almost white from my elevated position. I figured here was as good of a place as any to stop, with the full of the moon’s light upon the small knoll as well. Settling beneath the umbrage of a nearby tree—but not so much that I was completely shaded—I pulled out my notebook and began composing a few lines; nothing significant or worth mentioning here. Just a few mundane verses that captured the overall setting and my feelings about it.  

I must’ve dozed off, because my attention was suddenly drawn to my left, toward that mult-acred field, though now it was mostly dark; the moon having moved elsewhere. For a moment, I wondered at how I could’ve fallen asleep, since I’d been fairly focused on writing; but looking down at my notebook—ignoring for the moment the sleep-dispelling allure in the field—I saw that the last verse I’d written ended in a long, haphazardly drawn line—as if I’d literally fallen asleep in the middle of writing.  

Figuring that the concert had simply tired me out more than expected, I accepted the strange though not incomprehensible possibility, and returned my focus to the field. I couldn’t see anything, the moon’s light now completely gone from it; but I sensed, with doubtless certainty, the presence of someone or something there in the field—near the base of the hill on which I was seated. And again, with the same abruptness and vagueness of reason, that ominous anxiety came to me; and a chill swept through my body as if I’d entered a walk-in freezer.  

The animal part of my being screamed at me to run away, to get up and sprint headlong into the woods—an area towards which the moon had also gone. But another part of me, that often damning “human” and intellectual aspect, argued that I should stay and find out what it was that was making me feel so uneasy. And, like an idiot, I listened to that latter impulse, and remained; telling myself as further justification that nothing truly terrible could be found in some midwestern grove not far from a major residential area.  

I swear to you that up to the moment of the figure’s emergence, I had watched that field like a hawk; observed it with all the attention and focus of a panicked astronomer charting the cataclysm-promising passage of a celestial body. And yet the veiled entity appeared so suddenly that I actually reeled back, shocked as I was by it. One moment, there’d been nothing but the dark, knee-high grass, and the next—a sublimely white figure, its face inscrutably veiled, and its body cloaked in an equally white dress. And the whiteness of its garments was, for a reason I couldn’t then understand, *unnerving.* I found it weirdly and indescribably offensive to not just the senses, but my human sensibilities. It was inappropriately, disconcertingly white; almost self-illumined, as if the delicate fabric naturally or artificially emitted a glow of its own.  

As it drew closer, I realized with a sort of horror-laden incredulity that the shadows around it seemed to be pushed back by the luster of its clothing. Not as darkness is dispelled by light, but as a sentient thing might consciously recoil from something inimical to its being. It is a strange thing to suggest, I know, but that’s the best way that I can describe the bizarre visual effect of its approach.  

Upon reaching the base of the hill, the figure did something truly unexpected—and especially unsettling. Rather than lift its legs to accommodate the hike it would’ve had to undertake, it instead began to *slide* up the hill. The action reminded me of a doll or toy, with tiny wheels embedded in its otherwise immovable feet so that it could slide across surfaces in an approximation of movement. But this figure was no doll, and though its legs remained straight, there was still an undeniable impression of life in its form.  

I was paralyzed by the unreality of it, and meanwhile my anxiety had flourished into actual dread. I knew that this thing, this person veiled and dressed so whitely, had been the source of the feeling all along. Silently, they reached the summit on the hill, coming to stand on its surface with a smoothness of motion that only served to intensify my terror. There was nothing horrific or even unwholesome about their appearance - aside from the radiance of white. The dress was clean and well-fitted, but obviously old. I’d never worn one myself, but I was confident that it wasn’t something you’d find in any modern dress shop or clothing store.  

It was obvious that they had ascended the hill for me, and yet I hoped that somehow, I’d go unseen by the figure, immersed as I was in the shadow of the looming tree. But like a battered ship finally dashed against the crags of some unwelcoming shore, my hopes were annihilated when the figure turned to me and took a step forward.  

But that’s all they took – a single step. And in that step they crossed the ten or so feet that had separated us. In an instant, they appeared immediately before me, looking down at me, towering over me like a white-cloaked colossi. My fear-induced paralysis was relieved by a fraction, allowing me to tremble from the sheer extremity of my terror. Though I couldn’t see their face, I somehow intuited that the figure was smiling, and that this mile was not, in any conceivable way, benevolent.  

I’ve kept a plurality regarding their pronouns thus far because up until that moment, I hadn’t been able to tell whether or not they were male or female. The dress would obviously suggest the latter, and yet all throughout their uncannily-traveled journey from the field to me, there’d been a suggestion of...*androgyny* in their movement and stature. As if the figure had waited to come close to me to reveal its true anatomical form - *or a form it thought I would find alluring....* 

Regardless, when it bent down to bring its impenetrably veiled face level with my own, I saw that it was a woman, having the expected attributes thereof. And while I couldn’t see the figure’s face, I felt an almost palpable impression of age: an emanation of accumulated cycles, all of which I suspected had been spent in some deeply buried and airless tomb. Not necessarily a stench or musk, but a difference in personal atmosphere. And this sense of agedness caused me to feel a little less alarmed, induced in me a small calmness. I sitll felt dread at the unreality of the circumstances, and the unshakable idea that the woman’s unseen smile was in some way devilish. But even if I’d been able to move, I probably wouldn’t have fled.  

For a while, she simply stared, and my mind struggled to reconcile its terror with the ever-mounting sensation of calmness. Eventually, the latter won, and a potent drowsiness came over me. The rigidity of my body lessened, and I relaxed against the trunk of the tree. The figure, as if expecting or having desired this, then leaned back; standing or appearing to stand a little taller than before. 

From my perspective, she was no shorter than the trees around us, standing like an ivory or marmoreal statue reared in honor of some legend, shoulder-to-shoulder with the tallest of trees. The impression was no less dizzying than terrifying, and I quickly came to hope that the drowsy feeling would soon induce sleep, just so that I wouldn’t have to stare at the brilliant white Titan. 

But my wish was not granted, and I was instead kept on the very edge of consciousness, while horrors unparalleled were revealed to me one after another. 

Up to that point, if you’d told me that the veil was irremovably affixed to her face or had naturally grown from it, I would’ve believed you. There simply had not been even the slightest shift in the fabric of it. But then, in a single, almost dainty flick backwards of the head, the veil was thrown off, and the facial area finally revealed. I say “facial area” because there was no face. Neither was there a void-like pocket of darkness – I would’ve greatly preferred that, to what was actually there. 

Where her face should’ve been, there was instead a pulsing hive of tiny white insects – thousands of almost microscopically small organisms, packed together in a sickeningly animate ball. 

And more than the dress or the veil that had covered them, the insects glowed with a horrid whiteness; gave off a luster that suggested the blank, maddening nihility of uncreation.  They made no noises of their own, but the movement of their slimy, writhing bodies resounded wetly against the natural ambience of the woods.

Still rearing over me like a mythic giant, she raised one of her hands—whitely gloved, or just deeply pallid, I couldn’t tell—and plucked a handful of the insects from her face. Then, in a gesture that was both casual yet obviously mal-intentioned, she tossed the collection of writhing insects at me. 

I don’t remember feeling their impact – I only remember seeing, for a fraction of a second, the face of one of those awful insects as it neared my eyeball. And in its hideous, pincer-pointed and multi-eyed face I saw the purest intentions of evil – a visage filled with a humanly unachievable degree of hate. And then, just as whiteness had filled all of my sight, darkness washed over me; and I was, mercifully, plunged into the black oblivion of unconsciousness. 

I awoke abruptly, completely, standing at the edge of the hill, staring out over that far-stretching field. It felt as if I’d been watching something or observing the departure of someone. The events of before then returned to me, and I spun around, dreading to see the woman-in-white and her face frothing with pests. But there were only the trees.... 

I glanced back at the field, but felt that there was nothing left to be seen there, that whatever I’d been watching in an apparently somnambulistic state had already gone. For a moment, a small relief came to me, and with it the idea that I’d simply dreamt the entire nightmarish experience. But before I could savor this feeling for even a few moments, my hand started to itch; and looking down I saw that it was coated in a glimmering white substance. And in my hand was my notebook, its black leather almost completely smeared with the white stuff. Trembling, having a terrible idea of what the luminous goo was, I raised the book and opened it. Inside, I saw the white-smeared pages of old verses; the middling lyrics blotted out by the ectoplasmic white. Turning the pages—though not really sure why—I finally came to the most recent entry, and almost dropped the notebook in shock. 

Where before it had blotted and smeared, the white goo had instead been used as ink on the latest page. The script, written finely on the page, was given discernible contrast against the whiteness of the background by its uncanny luster. It was a poem, and had it not been my handwriting, I would’ve attributed it to some deranged yet masterful poet—a historically unrecognized sage of dark rhyme and verse. It was unlike anything I’d ever read before, and I felt both amazement and horror at the stark beauty of its composition, and the eldritch content ot the lyrics. 

*Finder’s Note: The author then writes the poem here, but I can’t bring myself to transcribe it. As he mentions, it is very well-written, beautiful in a way that I don’t have the vocabulary to convey. But it’s also horrifying. It tells a story, or maybe a prophecy of evil things to come – or things that have already happened, somewhere. Regardless, I’m not writing those lines here. I don’t want them on my screen. Sorry.* 

It’s horrific, obscene, yet lovely – isn't it? The work of a lyricist who couldn’t have been born anywhere but the Tartarean depths of a pre-human underworld, or on some lightless, hopeless sphere in deep space, where life has already dawned, thrived, and died. Only an environment of ever-present gloom and endlessly recurrent despair could’ve inspired such oppressive verses. And somehow, *I’d written it.* *My* handwriting flung those wonderfully baleful words at me from the ink-soiled pages.  

As I marveled, I sensed in the back of my mind what I initially thought to be the retrograde return of the moon. But prying my eyes from the pages I saw that the moon had not receded from its wood-ward path, but that my vision was with almost imperceptible slowness being clouded by white. This glaucomatic effect was terrifying, at first, but my brain soon connected it with the whiteness upon the pages; and, as weird as it sounds, this relation served to calm me.  

I soon after arrived at the assumption that I would, at the completion of the visual whitening, find myself *within* the dreadful, calamity-stricken world described in the profane poem. And while this probably would’ve inspired the most soul-chilling despair in anyone else, I felt an excitement that bordered on lunacy at the prospect. To see, with my own white-blessed eyes, the full enormities of horror, decay, and ghoulishness detailed so artfully in the poem....it was beyond tantalizing. I needed that experience, found myself craving it, powerfully. And to await its advent, to keep my mind from unraveling in the interim, I decided to relate my story. 

— 

It’s happening, it’s almost finished. The usurpation of my vision by the Ultimate Whiteness is almost complete. It’s overtaking me, or I’m being transported, atom by atom, to that awful otherwhere. Oh my God it’s breathtak- 

*The writing ends there. I don’t know what to say, don’t know what words I could possibly offer as closure to their story. I don’t think a eulogy would be appropriate. Not just because I never knew them, but because I don’t think they’re dead. They may be, to this world, but I have a feeling they’re very much alive in another....*

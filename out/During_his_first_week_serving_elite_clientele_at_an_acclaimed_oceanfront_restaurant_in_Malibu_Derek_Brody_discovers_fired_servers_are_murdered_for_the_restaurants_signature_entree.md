**THE GULL**

*Take your time with the killing. Ready a 12-gauge shotgun. Brass shells work best. Aim at the space between the eyes. Slowly wrap your finger around the trigger. Fire. One shot and the body will fall to the floor. There will be a hemorrhage at the rear of the skull from its contact with the concrete. Relieve the pressure quickly. When that’s finished, the butchering can begin.*

10:44am. 

One minute. Clock-in at 10:45, not a minute earlier or later. Both can earn you a write-up. More than one write-up gets you fired. There are between three and four firings each month. You’re either next, or you’re lucky.  It’s a Tuesday. Tuesdays are tame, aside from the one o’clock rush. But those are innocent in comparison to the roar of weekends. Friday through Sunday. Those days, your foot’s on the gas pedal from the moment you enter through the service door. 

This morning, I was almost late. There was an accident on the Pacific Coast Highway, washed with sirens and red flares. A helicopter air-lifted a middle-aged woman in an Alfred Donner ascot over the road towards Cedars-Sinai. For a second, I wanted to trade places with her. It was my eighth shift in a row — understaffed from firings and an employee walkout numbering six servers total. Exhaustion soured every one of my muscles, as worn as that woman’s skull, fractured and exposed from its blunt-force contact with the steering wheel. 

10:45. 

I punch-in. My number’s 163. Together, those numbers equal 10. On my first day two months ago, I thought that number somehow made me lucky. Such a solid number. Such a solid number for such a certainly successful future as a sever at The Gull. 

Doors open in 15 minutes. In the meantime, Jeff leads the daily pre-shift speech in the cherrywood-clad lobby, where echoes of Pacific Coast Highway traffic melds with a looping playlist of contemporary jazz spilling out of the overhead speakers. 

Jeff’s served at The Gull for twenty-seven years, longer than my parents were married. He’s six-four with a bleach-blonde crew cut that disarms the bulb of red at the end of his nose. His words are quick, remarks terse. It’s as if his entire pattern of speech has been preemptively edited by a scrupulous English composition professor. 

“I’m gonna make this short,” he says. “I’m seeing a lot of simple mistakes on the floor by newer servers.” He turns to me, eyes freezing. “Before introducing yourself to a guest, what do you look for?” 

“Eye contact,” I reply. 

“Why?”

“It’s unobtrusive.”

“Correct. What is that called?” 

“Unobtrusive service.” 

“Yes, but what is it *called?*”

“Coming Set.”

He nods, turns towards the double-glass entry doors. Outside, a short line of guests has slowly materialized along the stone koi pond. 

“Define Coming Set,” Jeff demands, licking spittle from the edge of his lips. 

This morning, there are 14 servers in pre-shift. Their heads dart back and forth between Jeff and I in a tennis match for which the prize is an unfulfilled sense of superiority. Even if Jeff loses, he’ll assert that I lost. And his words will be so sharp and precise that no one will have a chance to think twice. 

“Coming Set?” I repeat. 

“Coming Set.”

“It’s the concept of letting the guest invite you into the table.” 

“Say that again, louder.”

I clear my throat. “It’s the concept of letting the guest invite you into the table,” I repeat, hands shaking. 

“So?”

“So you don’t interrupt or come across as too forward.”

“You’re either obtrusive or unobtrusive. Our style of service is unobtrusive.”

Outside, the line is growing, a hum of voices crescendoing through the front glass. 

“And what do you do if your guest doesn’t make eye contact?” Jeff asks. I shrug. He faces the group. No response. “You walk away, do a lap, and come back to the table. If I see this—this thing these newer servers are doing table side that interrupts the guest’s experience, I’ll have you written up. Understood?” 

Nods. 

Finally, “That’s all we have time for, there’s already a line to the parking lot. Be ready to seat your tables. Let’s have a great shift.”  

Everyone scatters. I’m first to grab a handful of menus and wait further instruction behind the host stand. Jeff’s behind me. I can feel his breath on the back of my neck. 

“You’re shaking,” he whispers to me. 

“It’s cold in here,” I reply. 

“It’s never cold in here.”

“I’m freezing.”

“You’re scared of me,” he hisses. “What’s there to be afraid of?”

A manager unlocks the front doors, greeting the Tuesday firsts as they pour into The Gull. 

\*\*\*

I needed this job. Before, I was an admissions representative for an online university that sold diplomas to anyone willing to pay the tuition. The admissions department functioned more like a customer service call center. Fifteen bucks an hour. Tuesday through Saturday. Throughout my 90 day probation period, I consistently failed to meet the weekly cold call quota to capture the interest of prospective students whose information was purchased by the university’s marketing team. At the end of my 90 days, I was fired. *Higher education isn’t a good fit,* they told me. If you could call it that. 

That night, I drank whiskey sours at Roy’s Reef, a bungalow constantly cast in the feverish glow of a neon sign behind the bar that reads, "No Minors.” Billiards clanked. ZZ Top droned. In the men’s room, a wasp’s nest hummed somewhere beneath the whir of fluorescence. The bar top’s sticky and the walls peel plaster, but the drinks are strong and within walking distance of the Malibu Beach RV Park where my ’87 Winnebago’s tires have dry rotted from three years of ocean air. 

It was four past midnight when I tipped-out the bartender. Her skin was leathery from vodka sodas and sunbaths. She croaked a *Thank you* on my way out onto the shoulder of the Pacific Coast Highway. Summer mist creeped over the road. Moonlight eddied off crashing surf.

As I stumbled forward, my eyes welled with tears. Four years out of high school, no job. Zero prospects. Living in the old motor home my grandmother gifted me after graduation. It had taken her places, she said. And she believed it would take me places too. 

Wiping my cheeks, voices rose from the fog. Party swells had a way of filtering down the mountain opposite the beach — cliffside mansions tantalizing little groundlings like me, below. But this was louder, closer. 

I heard it before I saw it. Its behemoth sign towered over the shoulder of the highway, an electric pulse vibrating the pavement. Scrawled in domineering blue neon: THE GULL. Ahead, the parking lot had thinned from its usual brimming craze to a few lingering couples — blowing farewell kisses before maneuvering into their Teslas. I watched them race onto the PCH, leaving The Gull invitingly backdropped by the Pacific — starlight gently raining upon its concrete shoulders. There was a real sense of authority to the place, a magnetism. To see it was to feel that it *meant* something. I so desperately wanted to be a part of it. 

The following week, after three interviews and an IQ test, I was offered that part.

12:47pm.

The one o’clock rush pops early. All three of my tables are occupied. Table 23 is mid-entree. A first round of martinis just hit 25. And 26 is closed-out, the signed check buried beneath the laptops of three businessmen in navy suits. Working lunch. I’m working lunch too, but the most I’ll have time for is a glass of water. 

I approach table 25, searching for eye contact. Party of three. Position one is on the phone, the woman beside him delicately sipping her vodka martini — two olives, dirty, extra shaken — and the frail elderly woman at position three stares blankly across the dining room where, in the lobby, there’s an hour wait list. I plant myself at the edge of the table. At first, my presence isn’t enough for acknowledgement. It’s demeaning, irreverent. Like a show clown performing for a bemused crowd who takes themselves too seriously to lend an applause. 

“This is dry,” position two says, smacking her lips at her martini. 

“I’d love to make you a fresh one,” I reply. “Extra dirty?”

“No, *dirty*. This is *dry*.”

I motion for the glass. 

“Just bring me a side of olive juice,” she bites. “We’re ready to order.”

I reach into my apron, stiffened by starch. It’s tight around my waist, tight enough for thin bruises. I feel for my server book. Leather-bound, black — like our dress shirts and ties, designed to bleed into the walls of the restaurant. 

“What can I get started for you?”

“The veal,” position two says. 

“I don’t have the veal this afternoon.”

“You don’t have the veal?”

“Only on select occasions,” I reply. 

“Which are…?”

It’s rare we offer the veal. Three or four days each month. And never at lunch. *Dinner-only*, reads the employee handbook. Since my two-month tenure at The Gull, I’ve watched line cooks prepare the entree twice — seasoning a lumpy 8-ounce cut of red meat with house made French fry seasoning before searing it in a well-buttered cast iron skillet. It’s unusually bloody. Thick clots simmer in the steel, splattering out of the pan. Afterward, the line’s aprons resemble those of butchers rather than cooks. 

“The management informs us the morning of if the veal is a featured item,” I continue to the woman at position two on table 25. “Would you like another moment to decide?”

“No, I’ll take the filet,” she says. 

“How would you like that prepared?” 

“Medium plus.”

“I can’t do medium plus, but I can prepare it medium well.”

“You can’t do medium plus?”

“I can’t do plus.”

“At all?”

“But our medium well is a warm red center, is that what you prefer?”

“I *prefer* medium plus.”

“I’ll prepare it medium, and if the temperature isn’t right, I’ll bring it straight back to the grill. How does that sound?”

“Fine, for now. But I’d like to speak to a manager.”

“I’ll send them right over.”

She nods. I write. 

The culinary manager will not guarantee steaks “medium well” or above, nor is she interested in the argument between medium rare and medium rare-plus. Plus is too fine of a line.  

“Gimme a second, would you, Bill?” the man at position one says into his phone. “Bill. Hello? No, no, keep going, I’m at lunch. Hold on, Bill.” He mutes himself, lifts his head from the table. “I want the filet. Medium. What’s that come with?”

“Broccoli,” I reply. 

“Broccoli or broccolini?”

“Broccoli.”

“Dressed in butter?”

“It’s steamed, prepared with lemon juice and topped with reggiano cheese.”

“Gimme the wild rice. And can we get three waters? No ice.”

I nod, writing as he turns to the old woman at his side, her eyes blank and glossy. Drool pools at the edge of her mouth. Hands cobwebbed by varicose veins. For a moment, I can’t tell if she’s breathing, alive or dead. 

“What do you want, mom?” the man asks, cellphone in one hand, his mother's gnarled fingers — barbed by arthritis — in the other. “You want the filet?” She shakes her head. “You like the salmon…” *No*. 

From the corner of my eye, I notice table 23, position one, is out of water. Position four has finished his trout. There are no bussers at The Gull, so it’s up to servers to manicure dishware from guests. And the businessmen on 26 rise from the table, revealing the signed check among their dirty linen. Hosts will soon swarm the table, preparing it for reseat. If I can’t get to the check beforehand, I risk it being tossed with the laundry. No check, no tip. My stomach tenses.

I focus back towards the old woman at position three on table 25. Our eyes meet. She stares. The outer rim of her irises are tinted yellow. As we hold one another’s gaze, I picture the woman’s crooked hands tearing into rare, runny meat — muscle marbled with fat. Her lips bloody, teeth dripping with each bite. She’s hungry, starved. Clumps of stringy sinew fall from her mouth onto the table where a human carcass has been stripped of its skin, disemboweled. The head is still intact, eyes bulging and dry. Those eyes are familiar. There’s a long moment before I realize they belong to me. 

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

The nightmare is always the same. 

I’m served to the table, gutted and brined. There’s an incision from the base of my chest to the top of my naval. Skin is stretched wide, parted like a tough curtain to reveal roasted lungs, charred bone. Silverware glimmers as it slices flesh. Meat falls from my ribs — melding on the guest’s palate with the companioned bottle of pinot noir. I watch them from below, peering down on the meal that cost me my life. When the check hits the table, every bit of me is gone. They’ll charge it to their American Express. I wish I could say I’m a delicacy, but they’ve ordered me every night for the past two months. 

Sounds of consumption wake me long before the alarm. Biting, swallows. The bedsheets are matted with sweat. It takes awhile to remember I’m whole — fingers grazing over my limbs, marked by scribbles of long, shallow cuts. 

I’ve been scratching again. 

As a teenager, I scratched myself raw throughout the night, waking-up to raised patches of hot skin. Some mornings revealed long gashes running over my cheeks. I’d howl into the mirror. My mother would come running, trailing antiseptic that left my face cracked and dry. The summer before sophomore year, my mother insisted I wear mittens to bed. She crocheted them herself. The wool was warm, irritating the skin between my fingers. By the time classes resumed that September, the habit was broken, but scars remained. Now, they’ve mostly faded. Unless the light catches my face at just the right angle — unveiling veins of discoloration marring my cheekbones. 

Before work, I prime my face with a layer of concealer. Smooth, thin strokes of alabaster. War paint. The light inside the Winnebago’s bathroom is cold and cruel, illuminating the dull lines drawn by fingernails. Before The Gull, I never felt the need to hide my scars. But if, in the restaurant, my uniform buries me in the background, why shouldn’t the rest of me disappear?



\*\*\*

4:29pm. 

The Gull has emptied, its doors locked. 

Business resumes for dinner in one hour. Lunch servers are assigned a particular task to complete before 5:15, the in-time for evening staff. There are 14 servers, each of us responsible for one thing or another: cleaning restrooms, refilling condiment vats, breaking-down shipment boxes. And we must collectively prepare set-ups of linen-wrapped silverware. No one clocks-out until we tally five hundred. 

Behind the bar, I empty towers of glass racks — polishing martini stems and highballs using a vinegar-damp linen. The smell sharpens a migraine that’s slowly been gnawing at the base of my skull since two o’clock. 

My stomach lurches. 

Breakfast was 7 hours ago, and there are no meal breaks at The Gull. Someone inevitably files a lawsuit every few months, each time settling out of court for undisclosed outcomes. None of which have made a difference. Some afternoons, line cooks offer-up leftover pots of mashed potatoes or overcooked broccoli. We’ll swarm the kitchen, grabbing what we can while rolling silverware or taking out the trash. Today is not one of those afternoons. 

A hushed frenzy settles over the dining room. Vacuums hum. Dishes clank. Outside, crashing surf underscores the shrieking chatter of seagulls. Together, these noises form a sort of heartbeat. 

This place is just as much alive as you and me. 

It speaks through the current of conversations whirling over the dining room on a crowded Saturday night. It laughs with a burst of flames as meat first sizzles atop the grill, screams when glassware slips through our fingers before shattering over the tiled floor. And it eats, so I hear, when one of us is fired. 

It can go two weeks without a feeding. But no more than three. After three, reservations dwindle and the dining room quiets. The sewer clogs, fetid odors rise from the floor. Outside, its grand neon display begins to flicker — quivering in dying flashes of blue that bleed over the Pacific Coast Highway. Before the light dies, one of us is offered-up. 

Last Saturday, Ryan Thomas, a veteran server in-line for a bartender promotion, was fired for not properly starching his apron. There should be a distinct pleat down the center, drawn by starch and a tough iron. Ryan’s was rumpled, worn at the edges. It was his second offense. 

Three minutes before five, I gather the glass racks and retreat into the kitchen, returning them behind the dishwasher. Plumes of steam rise from arterial piping on the rear wall, upsetting the concealer hiding my face. I feel it sliding down my cheeks, revealing honest flesh. I wipe my eyes, smearing alabaster over black sleeves. 

“Derek,” says a voice behind me, low and sure of itself. “I’ll take you in the office.”

It’s Corbin Newlin, schlepping his shoes along the floor as he wades through the kitchen, only pausing long enough to make sure I’m following him — leading us into a narrow maze of metal that sidewinds towards a steel-plated door. There are three deadbolts. He uses a ring of keys to engage the locks and invites me into the office. 

The room is small and grey. Video monitors line the rear wall, flashing live footage of interior and exterior security checkpoints. It’s quiet, still. Fixed along the perimeter of the room are soundproof vinyl panels. There are two chairs: one at a built-in desk facing the surveillance footage, the other in the center of the room. Corbin crouches at the desk, nods towards the center chair. 

I sit, the door closes behind me, and all three deadbolts lock in unison. 

My heart is thumping. It’s so loud, I wonder if he can hear it too. 

“Do you know why I hired you?” he asks, metallic friction in his voice. Starch glistens the edges of his shirtsleeves, sharp as razors. Crewcut, honest eyes. Corbin’s a man you sense long before you see, his presence ricochets like a scream from the bottom of a well. Stooped in this confining office, he resembles a caged animal rather than an established restaurateur.  

“No,” I reply. 

“Guess,” he demands. 

“I’m passionate,” I say. 

“About what?”

“This job.”

“You’re *opportunistic*.”

“I appreciate what we do.”

“Which is?”

“We’re one of the best restaurants in LA.”

“We *are* the best restaurant in LA. And you *appreciate* a paycheck.” Then, “Is that it?”

“I—I don’t know what to say,” I answer, stammering. 

“So what should I do about an opportunist who just wants a paycheck and doesn’t know how to take responsibility for that?” He smiles at me, but his eyes are dead. “And if you can’t tell me why I hired you, how could I?” 

Over his shoulders, security cameras capture the lunchtime servers emptying out of the service door. 

There they go, and here I am. 

“Some things went wrong today,” Corbin continues. “The guests gave me their side of the story. I’d like to hear yours.” 

Shifts at The Gull are like fevers. You feel their beginning — anticipating the unforgiving hours ahead. By the time they’ve ended, you’re frail and dizzy. Thirsty, starved. It’s much later before you can remember what happened in-between. By then, it might be too late. 

“There’s no reason to be scared, Derek,” Corbin says, staring hard. “What’s done is done.” 

Footage of the Pacific flashes behind him. It’s soundless, like a broken memory. For a moment, I consider whether or not the images are real. 

“I’m not scared,” I reply. 

“Then tell me what I need to know.” 

But my mind is still swimming in fever. 

“I’ll tell you what *I* *know*,” he says. “There was a woman at 25. She ordered a dirty martini. Hendricks, I think. Remember her?”

I nod. 

“When the martini hit the table, it was dry.”

“I brought her a side of olive juice.”

“Bringing a side of olive juice for a dirty martini is like bringing a Pepsi without the flavor syrup.” 

“She said she was satisfied, so I—”

“She wasn’t. And I’m not done,” he interrupts, grinning. It’s a pleasure of his to take back my voice, and it’s great fun to hold all the cards — no matter what I say, Corbin knows how this conversation ends. By now, so do I. “You should have taken care of her martini. You didn’t. Strike one. Same guest, her filet lands. It’s overcooked. Strike two. Worse? You never communicated these issues with any of us. So, when I approach the table, they’ve already paid for their martini *and* filet. Both should have been comped from the check. But it’s too late. Strike three. I doubt we’ll ever see them again, and that’s not our fault. It’s yours."

Behind him, the tide rises. Waves break closer. In the distance, seagulls — white specks scraping the sky. On the monitor, they resemble shards of shattered glass rising out of the sea. I picture using them to cut into my face, tracing my scars with their edges and carving-out my eyes to relieve the headache. Instead, the seagulls swarm the horizon. 

And in an instant, they’re gone. 

“Do you know why I hired you?” Corbin repeats, pinching the bridge of his nose before meeting my gaze. Those eyes take every bit of me. There’s a long moment before I realize they’ve turned black. “Because, in the end, you’re just like the rest of them.”

He turns, engages a steel lever attached to the underside of the desktop that cues a mechanical whir. A trap door opens beneath my feet. Those eyes, black and numb, are the last I see before falling into cold darkness.

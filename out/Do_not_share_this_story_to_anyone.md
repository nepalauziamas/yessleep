My parents were always superstitious and always told me when I was a kid about a spirit that plays mind games to people who stay up after midnight. I always thought they told me that story so I can go to bed on time. 

It’s a Friday and my best friend Jace wanted me to come on a camping trip with him. I asked my parents for permission and they looked at me worried. They said no at first but my 16 year old self begged and begged. Until they finally gave in. 

It’s 6pm and Jace’s parents comes into the house and speaks to my parents. And in a stern and serious tone they tell Jace’s parents that I should not stay up after midnight. They didn’t question it and they agree thinking they were half joking. Before I left my mom gave me a pouch. It looks like cotton spice bag with beans and other herbs tied and sown with white thread. 

“Keep this on you at all times.” It was suppose to be one of those protective pouches that “wards off evil” or something like that. I put it in my backpack. Superstitious crap. Or so I thought. 

The first night we didn’t do much except had a camp fire and rested to prepare for the next day. 

We had a blast and decided to stay overnight. Jace’s dad parks the RV in their regular camping spot. My friend Jace wanted to hear scary stories. And I laughed. His parents shared “scary” experiences. After finishing it was 11:50pm. Then Jace’s parents asked why I need to be sleeping by midnight. I didn’t know. I told them probably so I don’t feel tired when I wake up. 

“Makes sense. It’s smart to be in a sleeping schedule so you’re not tired at school. Jace you need that.” Jace’s dad says. We laugh and I agree because he’s always napping in homeroom class. Then he asks if I have any scary stories. I grinned. 

“Yeah, I have one that my parents always told me about but they tell me never to share the story with anyone else.”

“Oooh.” The family says. 

“Share it. We need something better than my dads bathroom story.” Jace says. His dad pretends to be offended. 

“It was scary to me!” He says defending himself. “But I’m curious to hear this story.” 

“You sure?” I asked. They all wanted to hear it. 

“There is a spirit that feeds on the fear that drives people insane. No one knows where it came from and how it came to be. But every night after midnight it roams in search of its next person to feed. It roams specific areas but some says if you think you hear him you must run 107 feet away from the area you hear him. Apparently there’s a saying that it once said to a shaman. “If you can hear me, I come closer. If you think about me then I will follow you. You can’t see me but I can see you. Everytime you think about the sounds I make I come closer. I’m behind you but you look back and I’m in front of you. I’m above you but if you look up I’m under you. If you’re awake when the sun is gone and the stars are out then I will find you. I can be anywhere. Even if I’m not there.” It’s said that the spirit makes a single sound of a soft bell and if you’re unlucky to hear it then it has found you. And then the mind tricks begin.” And then we hear a bell sound. We all got up and freaked out until we saw a ranger pass by. 

“Holy shit my bad! Didn’t mean to scare y’all.” The ranger said. My heart was beating out of my chest. 

“No no you’re fine, Jesus that story gave me chills.” The mom says. 

“Yeah I was listening to it as I was patrolling  this camping ground. Scary fricking story.” 

It was 12:05am and we decided to go into the RV to rest. We put out the camp fire and put our stuff away. I was wondering if that ranger made that bell sound. Maybe it was his keys? I don’t know. I put my backpack next to me as I was getting ready for bed. 

I fell asleep but wake up again and see the dad covering the windows. He finishes and I go back to bed again but as soon as I close my eyes I could’ve sworn i saw a dark figure in the front of the RV. 

Morning came and I wake up to see that we’re already driving. I check the time and it’s 6am. I thought we were leaving at 11am? I look at the mom and she laughs. 

“That story got us spooked. He didn’t want to stay.” I felt so bad. 

“I’m sorry. It’s my fault.” 

“No no you warned us. But it’s okay, it’s suppose to rain later anyways.” 

The dad drops me home and thanks me for the scary story. I laugh and I thank him for the trip. Since it’s Sunday morning I just decided to chill. My parents ask about the trip and I say it was fun. And then they asked about the pouch. I take it out of my backpack and show them it. They look relieved. 

“Can I ask why you gave this to me?” I asked. 

“Well it’s for protection.” Dad says. 

“I know but from who or what?” 

“Just in general. Nothing from with that.” My mom says as she was preparing dinner. 

“True. Maybe it worked yesterday. I shared the story last night and I thought I saw something. But we were fine when we woke up.” My mom drops a plate and my dad looks at me. 

“Did you have that on you when you shared it?” He asked. 

“What?” I asked confused. 

“DID YOU?” 

“No? It was in my backpack in the RV.” I was scared and confused just looking at my parents reactions.

They asked me where and when I shared the story. I told them the truth except lied about the time. 10:30pm. 

“That area is cursed now.” 

They gave me a full explanation. If you tell the story without a protective talisman or pouch on you then you curse the area within 107 feet.  When they told me that story they had two on them and the house surrounded by sage and dried beans. Apparently it works as a protective barrier. If you have have a pouch on you AFTER you tell the story then only you are protected. 

It’s been 4 years and Jace said that they couldn’t go back to their regular spot and it actually became considered as a local paranormal hot spot. I never told him the truth. But hinted that they should never share the story. But then again they don’t remember the full story. Only I do. And you. The one reading this word for word.

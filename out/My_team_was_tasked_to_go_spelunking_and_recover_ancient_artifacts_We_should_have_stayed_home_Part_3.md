Riley and I only had so much air left, so Alison scouted out ahead to find some kind of alcove. It took several minutes but she did lead us to somewhere above, where there was a large air pocket. We had to climb up into a little continuation of the cave, but it was dry ground for now. It may have been quite exposed, but the area with the floodlights didn't seem safe enough to go back to yet.

We laid Fairweather down on the ground here. It seemed that we were safer, for now.

Jared helped Riley fasten some temporary solutions for her suit and injuries. 

“Start talking, suit.” Riley spat. 

“I could start yelling. Those things would be here in seconds.” He said. 

“Do that and we'll leave you. Seems like based on what Henderson said, you'd be just as a delectable meal to those things as us.” Alison said. 

As Alison grilled him I pulled something from his belt. It was a waterproof tablet, like ours, with slots for devices on the side. I tried to unlock it, but it was password protected of course. 

“What's the password?” I said. 

“...Unit089Des907.”

Everyone else looked at me as I entered Fairweather's password. I dimmed the screen as far as it would go.

“Something catch your eye, Alex?” Alison said.

I opened my water proof pouch. Then I held up my flash drive to her, “Remember this? It's what that guy gave me before he was dragged off by security. I have a feeling we should have looked into it sooner.”

“That thing? I thought you threw it away.” Riley said. 

I glanced at Alison and she narrowed her eyes. 

“Didn't we discuss you just throwing that away?” She said.

I shrugged. “I just thought… I don't know, but let's discuss that later. I feel as though there's something we should see.” 

I plugged the drive into the tablet and a window popped up. The drive was named ‘Evidence’, and had one folder called ‘Documents’ with a video file called ‘Alpha Squad’. I showed everyone else, and explained what Jared, Riley and I had seen up there in the citadel. How there had been more squads before us. About Myles and Margaret West. Alison was pointedly silent. Margaret was her family, I found out later.

We searched the folder titled ‘Documents’. It contained records of the Alpha, Beta, and Charlie Squad's endeavors down here. With HQ's big fancy logo in each legally binding corner. 

There were lists of names, and I recognized some of them. *Margaret West*, *Oliver May*, *Rachel Hiker*, and *Sam Walker*, Alpha and Beta Squads. 

Then there was Myles West, in the Charlie Team.

“Most of these were bodies tied up to the crosses,” I said. “Myles was the guy who gave me this flash drive at HQ…”

“The paper trail is there, but this doesn't make sense. What's this all for?” Riley said. 

Fairweather was silent. 

“Should we watch the video? Sync it up to our local comms?” Jared said.

I did just that and started up the file. It showed the group shots first. These were essentially mugshots, taken to be filed away in records like this later. It showed each member of the Alpha Squad. *Margaret West*, *Oliver May*, *Rachel Hiker*, and *Paulo Rodriguez*. 

*Paulo*. I had seen his face before. Or what was left of it with that creature using him as a puppet. 

The Alpha Squad went through an almost identical training as we had, though it seemed the execs weren't lying to them about being the first squad to enter the caves. One major difference is that they didn't have a cave-in like us. The group traveled through the caverns, set up camp, and headed right into the city.

*“Here we are.”* Margaret, the person recording, said. Her helmet camera captured the great expanse of the underground city, what could be seen in the dark water, anyway.

*“Look at this place…”* Paulo said, swimming past the camera.

We forwarded through the Alpha Squad's exploration until they landed in the city's largest building, *the citadel*. Inside were the vast array of well preserved murals. The Latin characters were only somewhat clear. 

The murals on the wall were the same, depicting the image of nine crucifixes hung with bodies. The actual crucifixes on the walls were empty. A major difference was that there was some kind of pedestal in the middle, a sort of center of worship it seemed. It hadn't been there when we were there. A golden, gleaming artifact shone with the passing helmet lights. 

*“What is that?”* Oliver asked. 

He walked up to it and stared, but didn't touch it. The last member of Alpha squad passed the frame, Rachel Hiker.

*“Don't touch anything.”* She said.

*“What's wrong? Scared of those local legends? Come on, think about how much this thing is worth.”* Paulo teased.

The object appeared to be solid gold, with a gem in the chest. It was a one and a half foot tall rendition of some winged creature with eight limbs. There was something in the center of it reflecting the lights. 

*“Wow look at this thing.”* Paulo said and climbed up. 

*“Paulo, what are you doing?”* Said Margaret.

He pried the object from the pedestal. It had been locked there by some kind of mechanism. He had to twist it, but it seemed to click as he did so. 

*“This statue must be worth millions–”* He was cut off by a slash. 

The statuette had ejected a sort of ritual blade that was lodged into Paulo's hand. He bled on it, and the gem in the chest seemed to absorb it.

Paulo was screaming. *“What's– what's going on?”*

There was a blur of action and screaming in the scene. The video soon paused. That was the end.  

“That first creature we saw,” I said. “It looked just like this member of the team, Paulo Rodriguez. I had met him before at HQ once too.”

Everyone took that in. 

“You said earlier that those things are trying to… complete something. Some kind of ritual of blood, no doubt.” Alison said. 

“In the citadel a few minutes ago, that thing launched right past me. It could have killed me, but instead it just went past. If it needed blood, why would it ignore me?” Jared said.

“The creature didn't kill Myles West either, only Margaret. Hence why he was able to give me this flash drive in the first place.” I said. 

“When you were there, Alex, you said the creature wanted ‘letters’?” Alison said.

“Yeah that's what it said.”

“Were you able to translate those Latin characters earlier, Jared?”

“No, everything was too crazy, and that video is too blurry to make out.”

“You're all still filming then, right?” Alison continued.

“My cam got wrecked when that thing dragged me off to the citadel. My long distance radio too.” Riley said. 

“I'm still recording.” I said.

“Great, hook it up to the tablet and pause it on the murals.” 

I did as she asked, uploading it and finding the proper moment in the recording. I unplugged my helmet from the side and handed it over to Jared. 

“Do you think that you could translate that?” Alison asked.

Jared looked it over. 

“Yeah, just give me a few minutes.”

“All right, just hurry. We need to make it back to camp and get out of here.” 

I thought it through while Jared read. Letters. *Margaret*, 

*Oliver*, 

*Rachel*, 

*Sam*… 

Letters. Latin… I had learned some in catholic school as a child, and something stuck out to me after a few minutes. “Jared, isn't *‘M - O - R - S’* a variant of the word *‘death’* in Latin?”

He was surprised, “Yeah, why?”.

Riley picked up my meaning.

“The first letters of those people's names… Margaret, Oliver, Rachel... and Sam. What did that thing say? That, ‘your first letter will do’?” She said. 

All of us paused while Jared confirmed. “Yeah. The first word is, *‘Death’*, *‘Mors’*.” He said. 

“There were nine crosses, right? If the first four are *‘Mors’*, then there are five more letters to account for.” Alison said. 

“Feels like we're playing Hangman, except if we get it wrong, we actually die…” Jared said. 

“It seems to make sense, but why would some ancient creature from hell need modern English letters to spell traditional Latin words? Why first names?” I asked.

“That last part was in the legends at least, *‘The silken blood, from the first names of the first borns…’*. I think all of us are the oldest siblings for our families, right?” Alison said. 

We all paused, nodded. 

“Except me, I'm the youngest.” Jared said.

“And my uncle, Myles, was a middle child…” Alison said.

“That must be why they didn't go after you. For Myles, it is ‘M’, but they would've already had an ‘M’ from Margaret. Maybe the other's names weren't right either,” Riley said. “But that one creature, it was the body of Paulo Rodriguez, right? Could that have something to do with why they can still use English? Maybe Paulo's lingual understanding was– I don't know– transmuted into the creature or something?” Riley said.

“Paulo spoke Spanish too. Both English and Spanish are child languages of Latin when you go back far enough, could there be enough remnants of it left to count for their ‘ritual’?” Alison offered. 

“It's gotta be something weird like that. The rest of this video has too much motion to read the last word. I don't really want to know what happens if they spell out their phrase though.” Jared said. 

“When they tried to get Riley, she was hanging on the second cross from the right. That creature said that *I* was the last letter that they needed.” I said.

“So if we continue with this logic, we have Three blank spaces and ‘ra’.” Jared said. 

“It killed this guy's teammates.” I said. Even though I couldn't fully see Fairweather's face under the helmet, I read the distraught aura. 

“What's Moon's first name? And Henderson's?”

“They lied to us…” Fairweather said. “They lied, they said– we wouldn't be in the ritual. We just had to ensure that no one else got out.”

“First names.” Alison growled. 

“...Frederick, and Nancy.” 

“Did you see where they hung them?” Riley asked me.

“No.”

We all had our own thoughts, listening and watching for any sign of the creatures. 

“*Infra*,” Jared said after a moment. “The phrase must be, ‘*Mors Infra’…”* 

“The legends.” I muttered.

“...*Death Below.”* Jared muttered.

Riley chimed in.

“That's great and all, but we still don't know what  the rest of this means. Why are they doing this? What are they trying to accomplish?” 

“My first name… is Isaac. It's a reawakening then…” Fairweather said. “They want to wake it all back up. They've been hiding for so long, and all they needed, was us. A little blood, to get the cogs moving again. We're here because of HQ. They want to see what happens when it comes back.”

By this point, it was clear Fairweather was cracking in the head. 

“They're trying to help these things? By giving them the correct people?” I asked. 

“Can't be– there were other squads like Charlie and most of Beta without the proper letters.” Alison said, but she didn't sound too convinced.  

“Maybe they were testing the waters– no pun intended. Maybe with Alpha, they genuinely didn't know this would happen. When it did though, they translated and are testing it based on the legends.” I said. 

“Well? What else do you know about this, Fairweather?” Alison said. “Why were you supposed to complete the ritual?”

“Do you think they tell us anything? All I know is that we were supposed to make sure you didn't make it out, and film the results.”

“If the things don't go after people with the wrong name, why did it take Paulo?” Riley asked. 

“As a servant. To become one of those things– don't you see?” Fairweather said. He worked himself up, and screamed the last. “The mother only has so much energy. She can only have two servants at a time until she wakes up.” 

We all froze as the words down into the water. Fairweather suddenly crawled towards Alison. I was ready to shoot, but the man started begging. 

“Please, take me with you out of here. I'll– I'll testify against HQ, I'll do whatever you need. Please–” 

Alison shoved him over. 

“We have to get back to camp. That's our only way out. Let's go.” Alison said. 

“What about him?” Jared asked.

Alison thought about it. “You can stay if you can keep up, and stay quiet. Let's move. Those things will be here any moment now. Everyone, we're going lights off. Use night vision. I know some of you don't have much left, so conserve as much as you can.” 

We nodded, and so did Fairweather, all of his previous authority gone. 

\~

We sneakily swam through the city, Jared leading Fairweather while I led Riley. The things hadn't found us in that alcove, luckily. 

Somewhere through our journey the last floodlight had been broken. Without those floodlights, and even with night vision on, it was difficult. Though it made it easier to see the silhouettes of the creatures darting above, looking for us. We paused whenever one was by. We were at the back end of the city soon, close to the mouth of this underground lake. 

Just then my suit battery clicked, and my night vision went out. It was pure darkness for me now. Underwater cave darkness. 

“God damn it,” I cursed quietly as I could. “My night vision's out. Riley?”

“I'll do my best.” She said.

I felt that I could make out the hazy ghosts of the surroundings I had just been navigating, but I couldn't really. Despite Riley's leading I bumped into things along the way.

Alison paused our group. “Listen up. They're coming for us for sure, so be on your guard. We're going to be as quiet as we can be, and hopefully get out of this without a confrontation. Got it?”

All of us probably nodded, but I couldn't see it. 

“Good. Let's go.”

As we went up the hill to leave the city, we all heard the crawling, broken voice of those things, as if calling from the middle of the street. 

“Isaac, Riley, Alex… come out. Come out. If Alex can't play, come in his place, Alison.”

“My night vision– it failed.” Fairweather muttered.

“Mine's out too. Jared?” Riley said.

“Coming. Can't promise good results leading four of us though.” 

We were moving much slower now. Not just to be quieter, but three of us had to feel along the walls. The silence had fallen on us too, except now I could hear something. 

“The generators are just up ahead,” I whispered. “There's a hill leading up to the mouth here, walk carefully.”

We all crawled up. The group's half blindness made us as effective as infants, but we did make it. There was a sort of growlish clicking from the darkness ahead. I would have assumed it was the generators, but my gut dropped like bricks at that sound. Alison, or who I assume was Alison, pulled us all one by one against the nearby cave wall. 

At the back of the group I heard Fairweather cry out as he tripped on one of the fallen lights. The growl in the dark turned almost into some kind of broken laughter. 

“There… you… are…” The thing hissed.

Alison flipped on her headlamp. No point in hiding it now. 

The thing using Paulo's body lunged at Fairweather first, and his screaming echoed out. The rest of us ran for our lives, weapons in-hand. Jared's lamp was on now. I flicked on my flashlight. We fired at the creature, but it wasn't bothered by anything we did. 

We had to run.

“Go, go!” Alison said. 

We ran down the cave for long minutes, thinking that those things would jump us at any second. Doing it in diving gear wasn't just inappropriately comical, but tiring. It became quieter, and we made it back to camp. I thought that I could hear those creatures crawling in the walls. 

Without a word, we checked the drill. It was fully charged now and Jared grabbed it. 

“What do we do about the rest of this stuff?” Jared said. 

“Leave it, we have to go.” Alison said. 

“Is there some kind of plan?” I asked and grabbed my rifle left behind earlier.

“My best idea was running and escaping, but if you had something to add I'd be glad to hear it.” Alison snapped.

We did get some ammunition, and took off our diving gear, but otherwise we left immediately. Felt weird to leave all of that expensive gear behind, but what could we do? 

We ran with all of the strength our training gave us. Without that diving gear I felt like the wind. I glanced behind me occasionally, but it was a bad idea. They were definitely following us now. I saw those creature's heads popping out from the holes in the wall, gaining on us as quickly as anything. I could almost hear the whispering of our names. 

We stopped as we made it to the cliff where the entrance was located. I wanted to take off my helmet, but it seemed like a bad idea.

“Jared, get to work on that cave-in. Alex, Riley, weapons up. It's time to play whack-a-mole.”

All of us shone our lights up at different areas of the walls. The small tunnels on them were intimidating now. As sudden as the action had been, it was quiet. We waited in it. 

Then we heard something call out from the depths. One of those things popped out and all of us fired together. The thing squealed in pain and buried itself back into the hole. We could hear its skittering claws *tacking* across the inside cave. All of us watched frantically.

“Easy now…” Riley said. 

Jared had climbed up now and managed to start the drill. He was muttering just before he had started, “I don't believe in flesh monsters… I don't believe in flesh monsters…”.

When a creature's head popped up, we fired together. It seemed to stall them, but they were getting closer. Inch by inch they crept. 

“How's it going up there, Jared?” Alison shouted between gunshots and drilling. 

“Not as fast as I'd like!” Jared said. 

“Make sure you drill the anchoring rocks–”

“I know, I know!”

I dodged to the side as an arm tried to grab me from one of the holes. I had been a little too close to the wall. We were all slowly backing up until we were pushed against the cliff. 

Jared called down. “It's no use, I just don't have the time.”

Alison cursed and then seemed to realize something. She walked over to me. She took Moon's weapon from me, which had been strapped on my back, and handed me something else. 

“A grenade? We've had damn *grenades* this whole time?”

“Emergency Force Charge,” Alison said. “Only for emergencies… and not very helpful underwater. Just remove the key, twist the cap, and it'll blow in ten seconds. Get Riley up there and hide in that alcove on the side. I'll hold them back, get that to Jared.”

“What about–”

“Don't waste time on this nonsense, that's an order. Now go.” Alison interrupted.

I went to obey. Riley got on my back. Climbing with the weight of two people is not something I'd personally recommend. Without the small strength boost these suits gave us, I doubt I'd have been able to do it. Alison dual wielded rifles below, keeping the creatures back only with might alone as I handed the charge to Jared. He looked at me like I was insane, but didn't raise a complaint. He followed the charge's setting instructions and stuck it in the middle of his drilling. We ran alongside the cliff to the small alcove off to the side, and hid around the corner. 

“Here goes nothing… or here goes all of us. We're not all gonna die, are we?” Jared said.

“Die, you freaks!” We heard Alison scream as the charge blew. 

Dust and stone erupted from the cavern entrance, and light burst in from the outside. There was enough dust to breach temporarily through my suit filters, and I coughed while I waited for my head to stop ringing. The corner of the alcove had protected us though. 

When it was settled, I peeked out over the floor below and saw the last skittering of one of the creatures escape from the outside light. One of them, the blind one, had been crushed by rubble. Though if it was dead I have no idea.

“Alison?” Riley called out. 

There was nothing for a moment. Then we heard a small wheezing, “Here…”.

Jared and I climbed down and helped Alison out of the small rubble around her. We climbed up the cliff, Jared doing what I had to help Alison up the cliff. The four of us walked out together into the morning light. We took in fresh air as we removed our helmets. It seemed like that thing was afraid of the light out here, and that gave us the confidence to sit, treat what injuries we could, and rest. 

Authorities did come to investigate the explosion, and that is where you know the rest. Who knows what will happen now, but that's our testimony against those bastards at HQ. Those things were two kills away from completing whatever ritual it was. I hope, we all hope, that those admins are put away for a long time, and those caves stay sealed. It sounds unbelievable, trust me, we know, but we saw what we saw, and if you ever went down there, you wouldn't come out.

We still don't know what those things were, what they were trying to complete, how the entire city has lasted this long underwater. In the end though, I'm just glad we made it out alive. 

And before you ask, no, I'll never go cave diving again.

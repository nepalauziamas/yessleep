[Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w7meq0/i_got_rid_of_an_abortionist_now_i_face_the_angels/)

 

Standing there next to a giant lizard-like angel on my right, another feathery fallen angel to my left, and a hulking fiery monster who called himself an Archangel before me, I was beyond terrified.

I expected St. Peter and a giant golden gate. Maybe a line. Folks always assume there’s a line.

I swallowed hard, unsure of what I was even swallowing.

“Sisoe,” Uriel called out, “Your defendant is experiencing a bit of a crisis.”

Sisoe turned to me, smiling wide with rows of bright white teeth contrasting with her black scales, “Charity, you need to calm yourself. Your body is gone, and all that remains is your spirit. The state of you can all come apart if you panic,” her clawed hand rested on my shoulder, “It’s okay. Everyone gets scared. It’s why we say so often-”

“*Be Not Afraid!”* Uphir hissed mockingly, “But you *should* be, little one.” He grinned wickedly at me, “You most certainly *should* be.”

“I object, Archangel! Uphir is intimidating my charge!” Sisoe snapped.

Uriel’s claw knocked on the stone, causing the ground to shudder, “**Sustained**,” Uriel turned to Uphir, “Watch your tone, Fallen One. Trust me, you will wish to remain for this case. I anticipate this will be far more than the standard dull affair.” 

“Dull affair?” I asked.

Sisoe knelt next to me, whispering, “We angels are timeless beings. As such, when mortals pass into our realm, which is also timeless, we take care to judge each individually. As you can imagine, that’s a few millennia for every day mortals are dying on the physical plain.”

My eyes widened, “That must be terrible…”

Sisoe smiled, “Not for us. It is our task! That is why I asked you not to worry. We do this all the time,” she beamed to me, “You’re in safe hands.”

“*For now,”* Uphir hissed.

Uriel narrowed his eyes on Uphir.

“*Good, the prosecution wasn’t winning any favors with the judge,*” I thought.

Or, at least, I thought I had thought that to myself.

Uriel turned to me, “Persecution. We are not your human court.” 

I gulped, feeling a sinking sensation through my body.

Uriel turned to Sisoe, “I thought you’d have prepared her?”

Sisoe cleared her throat nervously, “You don’t have a body right now. Your thoughts are heard, clearly, as words you speak. Okay? That’s how Uphir knew you were in a panic.”

I nodded slowly, “S-Sorry.”

Uriel dismissed my words with his hand, “You spoke no offense, but know I hold no favor to either party,” Uriel looked over my book, “As you feel Uphir is already disadvantaged, however, I shall let Sisoe offer your good deeds first, in your defense.”

I bowed, “Thank you, Archangel.” I said, hoping humility would go far.

Uphir grinned as Sisoe walked past the podium with my Book of Life in her hands.

Sisoe cleared her throat, looking over the book, “Doting mother, caring and contributing member of her community. Charity Higgins attended church regularly, ensured her children and husband adhered to the word of Our Father, the Christian Protestant teachings, and donated her free time to many efforts that matched her name, Charitable.” 

I smiled, hearing Sisoe speak of me that way, though I realized then that I was undoubtedly dead.  

I wouldn’t see my children or husband again. Not even my uncle or my friends from our church group!  

I couldn’t help but let a few sobs leak out of my mouth.

“Even now, her heart breaks, missing her family and community, as you can plainly see,” Sisoe said, smiling proudly and closing the book. She turned and returned to my side, beaming.

I smiled, “Thank you.”

Sisoe grinned, “You did well in many ways.”

Uphir held my book in his thin hands for a moment, looking it over. He closed it, leaving it on his lectern, and approached the same spot before Uriel. Uphir turned to Sisoe and me and slowly clapped, smiling indignantly.  

My face fell. What did that demon see? Uphir looked so confident now, and I had the slow and creeping realization that if he was satisfied, if he won, then I was going to Hell.

“How *lovely*,” Uphir said, turning back to Uriel, “I have to say, how in all the realms could such a lovely young mortal ever find herself led astray from God’s light when she basked so deeply in it…?” he trailed off.

Uriel listened intently.

“Perhaps, maybe too much?” Uphir asked, “Crusaders were an interesting lot… Some fought for God. Some fought for their honor. Some fought to kill heathens. Or at least whom they thought were heathens. All but reading a few passages different from the other, and one becomes a heretic!” Uphir laughed, “Mortals are… feckless that way.” 

Uriel’s eyes narrowed, “**Get on with it, Uphir**.” 

Uphir held a hand up, “But, as with all things, Charity here is not without sin,” Uphir said, moving back to my book, “A dark and ominous stain on these otherwise pristine pages. Sisoe spoke of Charity’s free time. But what, exactly, did she do in that free time? Could it be the same as our misguided and overly prideful Crusaders? Thinking they were doing God’s Will when in fact,” Uphir grinned to me, “They undermined it? Went against it? Did things not required of them?”

My lip quivered, and Sisoe placed her claw under my chin, speaking out, “I object! More intimidation.”

“**Get to your point, Uphir**,” Uriel said, his fiery eyes on me, “She knows what did, exactly what she did, now… Explain how it outweighs her good works.” 

“Charity not only used her faith to harm others but that harm dove deep. Deep enough to take a living child from her father and drive an otherwise good doctor to commit the most heinous of sins: To kill,” Uphir said, walking over to Sisoe's podium, “Moreover, I know how easily she joined one of my fallen brethren.” 

“W-What?!” I gasped.

“The fact you could not see him for what he was doesn’t shock me,” Uphir explained, “Saleos is, indeed, very good at what he does,” Uphir said as he moved back to stand before Uriel, “Shall I show you, Archangel?”

Uriel nodded, and I swear, I saw a slight grin on his maw.  

“Then, let us paint the scene!” Uphir opened my book and ripped a page out.

I gasped and stumbled forward as everything turned bright white around me.

In an instant, I was back home in Indiana! I remembered where I was. I was protesting outside of an abortion clinic to little or no fanfare.

I just had my sign, my baby Gracie, in her stroller, and a few other proud Christian Warriors protesting outside the abortion clinic in our legal “500 feet” away spot.

I was approached by a man, Sal, as I knew him. He was the leader of a different pro-life group I had joined.

Though at this point, I had yet to meet him officially.

“Blessings to you three. You’re truly doing the Lord’s work,” Sal proclaimed, a bright smile directed at us. He wore a tanned suit, a pair of crocodile leather shoes, and a walking stick that had a crescent moon ornament on the top.

At the time, he looked like a preacher.

I smiled at him, “Thank you.”

He looked down at Gracie, who was only two years old then, “And who is this little bundle of joy?”

“That’s my Gracie,” I beamed.

“A true lamb of God,” he glanced up to me, “Your only child?”

I shook my head, “Nope, the others are in school while my husband is at work. This is our fourth little baby!”

“*Go forth and multiply,”* Sal said with a grin, “You took that command seriously, I see.”

Maud, the other woman in our protesting trio, turned to Sal, “Would you like to join us? We have a free chair."

Sal smiled, “How kind of you. Yes, I’d love to join you.”

“Didn’t catch your name,” Maud smiled, “I’m Maud Stevens. Please call me ‘M,’ it’s easier, and this here is Jim Perkins,” she addressed Jim. He might have been lanky at over sixty, but he was still a tall fellow.

“How are you both?” Sal asked with a smile.

“Livin’ the dream,” Jim chuckled, “What was your name again, Mister?”

“Oh, not Mister, please, that’s my father,” Sal grinned, “My name is Sal Lous. Nice to meet you.” 

For some reason, I felt a weird pang in the back of my head. It wasn’t how I recalled feeling at the time, but that name, hearing Sal say it, made me feel uneasy this time.  

Sal took a seat and sighed in relief, clutching his cane in both hands, “Legs and back are not what they used to be.”

“Amen, brother!” Jim called out.

Conversations were light-hearted until someone passed us by, clearly walking briskly and towards the clinic. They had sunglasses, and a hoodie pulled over their head.

Sal stood up, pointing his cane at the woman, “Hide your face from us slut!” he called out, “But you cannot hide your deeds from the Almighty! He sees all sin, done in the cover of darkness or the light of day! His judgment on you is always present! Repent! Do not succumb to the delusions of the faithless!”

I stood next to him, “Praise God, that’s right! Don’t murder that baby! Love it!” I said as I picked up Gracie, bouncing her happily in my arms, “You don’t know God’s Love until you hold your child!”

The little slut flipped us off, to which I booed and hissed at her.

She went in regardless, and I sighed, putting Gracie back down in her stroller.

Maud and Jim had stood up with us but still held their signs up.

"*God doesn’t make mistakes*!" and "*Abortion is Murder*," respectively.

“My, but you are passionate,” Sal declared, having a seat with a mild grunt of relief.

“I love every child of God. If these girls don’t want the babies, they should just give them up for adoption!” I proclaimed.

Jim and Maud were quick to say, ‘Amen.’

Sal smiled, “Amen, indeed,” he reached into his pocket and produced a card and said, “My dear, maybe you can help us. See, I’m part of a rather… Let's call it an ‘unpopular’ organization. The media paints us poorly, but for someone like you, I imagine you’d see past such things.”

I picked the card out of his hand. It merely said: “Army of God.” followed by a link which said: “Accessible only by Tor,” next to that was a twelve-digit code.

I looked at him, “What is this?”

Sal smiled, “Do your research, my dear, and I’m sure you’ll find out. Please do not share that with the unfaithful.”

With that, Sal excused himself.

I had to leave as well, as it was going to be time to pick up the kids from school.

Everything changed into the twilight realm, and I was confused, looking around frantically.  “W-What was that?”

“A memory,” Sisoe explained, moving towards me, “We can look into the pages of your book of life and see your deeds. You experience the memory, and we watch it from the outside in.”

“Your preparation skills are poor, Sisoe. It seems you’re out of practice,” Uriel chided.

“I am sorry, I didn’t expect to be the one chosen-” Sisoe tried to argue before she was cut off.

“Archangel, I was not finished as of yet,” Uphir said, his hand on another page, “There’s far more to discuss….”

“W-wait!” I shouted as Uphir ripped another page from the book.

I felt like I was hurled inside a *Gravitron* carnival ride, everything spinning around and around before I found myself back in a familiar memory.

It was the following day after a long bout of soccer momming, and I was home. My husband slept soundly in our bed, having to wake up early for work.

I couldn’t get Sal out of my head, though.

I got out the card Sal had given me. I got on my computer and started searching.

I discovered that the *Army of God* was a group that tracked down abortionists and held them accountable. As I read, I glanced at the card and typed in the website address.

*“PAGE NOT FOUND”* was all I got.

Then I spotted the little words ‘Accessible only by Tor’ and searched for that.

Tor was apparently some super secure browser, and once I found it, I could get to the website.

Soon I was putting in the 12-digit code, getting my phone number registered, and so many authorizations later, I had an account on the website - no, you’re not getting the address!

They had a wealth of information, a little chat room, bible verses, and a manual.

The manual had so much information! I read through it, and by the end, I realized why this organization was called the ‘Army of God.

These people were soldiers of God - Angels on Earth!

They had goals of shutting down clinics, intimidating doctors, and the like.

But it wasn’t physical violence. That would be illegal. This group was about getting the doctors to quit by pressuring the people around them, harassing them online, finding their addresses, exposing them to local communities, and undermining their day-to-day lives.

There was an extensive list of doctors on the website, and soon enough, I saw a message pop up in the chat.

“Charity, is that you?” The username was Sal19\_72\_30L.

I typed in response, “It is!”

“How are you finding the group?” Sal asked.

“It’s brilliant!” I responded. 

“Praise Be!” Sal responded first, with many others responding.

After chatting, we got down to the brass tacks.

“Doctor Raj Singh,” Sal typed, “That’s our current focus.”

We discussed a great deal of information. Doctor Singh was an abortionist, and sure enough, his daughter went to the same school as my son.

The goal was pretty simple: My son was to harass and bully her for having an abortionist father.

When Sal asked me, “Would your son be up to the task?”

I added a smiley emoji and confirmed, “Oh, he most certainly is!”

Everything whirled around once more, and I found myself standing at the kitchen counter, making bagged lunch for my son and daughter, who were off to school.

I had told my son, Jeremy, about the girl. I couldn’t remember her name exactly like I had blocked it out or something. I referred to her as ‘The Target,’ and that became our code.

“You know her?” I asked Jeremy. 

Jeremy shrugged, “I guess so. I’ve seen her. She kind of keeps to herself.”

“Her father’s a terrible doctor. He kills babies, I found out,” I said as I handed Jeremy his lunch bag.

“That’s legal?” Jeremy asked.

“In this Godforsaken country, it is,” I chided as I cleaned up the kitchen, “It’s horrible that someone like that has children. I bet she’d be fine if her father wanted to kill little Gracie or your sister Joy. Absolute Godless filth,” I snapped. “Probably not even Christians.”

Jeremy was a football player and, most importantly, a well-liked boy in school. If anyone could put the fear of God into someone, it was him and his friends.

The scene melted and reformed around me once more, and I found myself walking in my business meeting clothing.

I knew where I was headed. It was a few months later, and I was called into the principal's office for my son’s ‘Behavior.’  

I had an idea of what it was and was ready to go into full ‘Army of God’ mode.

I got to the school and, of course, Jeremy was there. The girl wasn’t. However, I did spot her father. I saw his face on our website.

Dr. Singh looked rather upset.

“Mrs. Higgins,” the principal, a lovely woman named Bethany, called Jeremey and me in.

“I would like to-” Dr. Singh was cut off.

“One at a time,” Bethany interrupted as she escorted Jeremy and me into her office, closing the door on him. “Oh my, this is something I’ll say that dontcha know,” she took a seat, looking at Jeremy and me, “Now, I know you folk, and I know this is just some accusation that has no bearing on reality, so let's just get to the point hmm?”

“Accusation?” I asked, “Of?”

“Okay, so Dr. Singh’s little girl is claiming that, *allegedly*, your son and his friends cornered her and attacked her,” Bethany said with an eye roll and using air quotes with her fingers while she said the words ‘allegedly.’ “Which I know your son wouldn’t do. Not to mention she named *all* the most popular boys in school, dontcha know,” Bethany explained.

Jeremey turned away from her.

“Is the girl okay?” I asked.

“Oh, she’s just *fine*! Some ripped clothing and such, but that’s about it from what we could tell. The nurse handled her from there. She *claims* she was sexually assaulted,” Principal Bethany scoffed, “As if such a thing could happen here, am I right?!”

“I didn’t do it,” Jeremy argued.

“Oh, listen, I know that! Plus, you’re our best chance at the state championships!” Principle Bethany gushed, “So trust-you-me when I say we don’t want this going public, and we also don’t want this getting out of hand, so here’s what I *have* to do,” Bethany said, smiling, “We’re going to ‘suspend’ the team while we ‘investigate,’” Bethany said, liberally using her air quotes, “And we’re going to find her to be a little liar and she’s going to be expelled for it likely. If Dr. Singh complains, the district will settle out of court to keep this all nice and quiet.” 

"Two weeks suspension?!" I shouted, "That's ridiculous!"

“Oh, come on now, it’s two weeks from school, and we’re doing it to everyone involved, her included. I promise it’s not going on any of their records or anything because we know the little drama queen is lying,” the principal smiled at me, “Look at it like an extra bit of Spring Break, okay?”

With our agreements made, Jeremy was pretty happy, so I headed out of the office, putting on my best ‘I’m distraught’ face.

Dr. Singh looked at Jeremy and me, his eyes on Jeremy specifically, “Young man, I hope you will understand that you and your friends will have to answer for what you’ve done to my daughter.”

I turned to Dr. Singh, “And you’re going to have to answer for what *you* have done to all those babies your murder every day in your ‘office,’” I snapped, turning and saying nothing else.

After that, when I got to the car with Jeremy, he turned to me, “Mom, I swear, it was just teasing, but it got out of hand and-”

I hugged him, “Oh, I’m so proud of you!” I looked him dead in the eye, “Listen, you and all your friends can come over for a party this weekend, okay? But before the party, we’re all going to have to agree that no one admits to even *seeing* that girl, okay? Don’t worry. Mommy will protect you and all your friends!” 

Jeremy nodded, “O-Okay, mom. Thanks.”

Once we got home, I started to prepare for a party. I called all the parents, who were all very upset about this whole ordeal.

But I spoke to each of them, explaining how ‘The Target’ had it out for our boys, and soon enough, I had all the parents on my side.  

One of the boy’s fathers told me that it was his son’s birthday that weekend, which was a lucky break for us, I had thought! I explained to his father as I felt the situation needed to be presented: That “The Target” was a liar and that none of the boys had ever seen her that day. He was on my side quickly.

When I logged in later that night, Sal was already chatting with me.  

“Charity! I want to say that your story touched me! Also, it turns out there haven’t been any real charges or the like yet… Also, as a little FYI: it seems all the footage in the school’s cameras that day is… ‘corrupted,’” he explained.

I beamed, “Oh, Sal! Thank you. You’re the best!” 

“No need to thank me, just doing my part,” Sal typed out, “You did yours. The rest will likely take its course over the next couple weeks.”

A whirlwind caught me again, and I celebrated with Jeremy at home after just receiving the call from the principal.

Yes, with no evidence and all the boys having the same story of a typical day of locker room hijinks after an average day of practice, the Target got expelled for lying.

I hoped at that time that the doctor and their family were going to move or that he’d close up shop. That was my goal, of course. 

But the little bitch jumped online and started posting terrible lies and stories on her Facebook! 

Sal, of course, was on the case! As we're all the Army of God folks.

After only a day, her entire Facebook was set to private! I considered it a victory.

My vision shifted once more. It felt like I had fallen down a flight of stairs as I found myself at my kitchen table a few days later. I looked up to see Jeremy walking toward me with very dark circles under his eyes.

“What’s wrong, sweetie?” I asked him.

“T-that girl,” Jeremy said, looking at me with a fearful and confused look in his eyes, “She… She killed herself last night.”

I was taken aback at first, but I bounced back, “Well, that doesn’t shock me! Look at the household she grew up in! The girl was raised by an abortionist, so to her, life is cheap. Must be the way that the whole family operates.”

“I’m… I’m going to go to my room,” Jeremy said.

“Okay, honey, call me if you need me,” I said as he walked up the stairs.

The scene melted away, and I was on my knees with Sisoe at my side. Her hands were clasped together in worry.

“Tsk, Tsk, Tsk,” Uphir said, looming over me, “Causing a little girl to kill herself…?” Uphir’s smile grew as I could feel the weight of his shadow pressing upon me, “[How *hypocritical*](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple)*.”*

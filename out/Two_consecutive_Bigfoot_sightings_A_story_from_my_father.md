So this is a story from my dad. Believe it if you wish, or don't. But I think that by the end of this post, you too will believe in the Sasquatch.

My dad and his buddy were adventurous in their youth. They would often sneak out at night to go for walks, along with their pit bull Bo. One night they were on a trail leading through the woods. They came to a point where thick vines growing overhead blocked out the moonlight. The path fell pitch black, but my dad and his friend continued onward. They stumbled into some undergrowth and walked directly into a giant wall of hair. It grunted loudly and turned to face them.

This creature stood up, at least ten feet tall, and staring directly into my dads eyes. Now you may think it was a bear, they stand on their hind legs right? You are correct, but bears don't run on two legs. This creature arose from its rest and upon seeing the two buddies and their pit bull, took off into the woods. Bo gave chase, and my dad sprinted back home with his buddy. They stayed on the porch the rest of the night, listening to the sounds of barking in the distance, worried about the dog. The next morning Bo returned covered in mud and "dog" tired. He slept all day, and didn't move. The true hero of the story for protecting my dad and his friend. My dad didn't sneak out for another night walk for a couple months after that. He feared what might happen if he crossed paths with the beast again. Unfortunately for him, he was going to find out soon enough the next time he left through his bedroom window to go for a walk.

Once more, it is the middle of the night. My dad is out once more with Bo and his buddy. They steered clear of the trail they took the last time.They walked in fear, jumping at every noise they heard. They still shuddered at the thought of the last time they went out on a midnight adventure. They made it safely on their trip, but it wasn't until they made it back to the driveway that they saw it again. It was a shadow illuminated by the moon, standing tall and fierce. It turned as if it was searching for them, and for a short moment everything was still. As if both the beast and the pair of friends were in disbelief that they were seeing each other again. Bo breaks the stillness and gives chase once again. My father seizes the opportunity to dive into some bushes with his friend. The beast runs by their hiding spot with the dog on its heels. They take this chance to make a break for the house, but when they look back the beast turned around and was coming back towards them! Now back in the day my dad could run a 40 in 4.5 seconds, and this thing was on his heels! They make it on the porch and climb on top of it. They thought they were in the clear, but the beast managed to get a hand full of my dads shirt and ripped it off! Bo had caught up at that point and chased the beast back into the woods. They never saw the monster again, but I may get the third sighting. We recently moved on to the property my father grew up on, and I am as adventurous as he was. Perhaps the beast will be seen again by myself, we can hope so, and I will surely update this if I am ever given such a chance.

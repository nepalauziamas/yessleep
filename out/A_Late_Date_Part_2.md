 **I have an update.**  I might have found a little more about Olivia and what happened, even tho I'm not sure if it was worth it. If you haven't read the first part, I recommend you start there:

I  woke up, breathing very heavily. It was the fourth time this night. What  happened yesterday was absolutely terrifying, it was perfectly reasonable for me to act this way. I rapidly got up and  checked the locks, once again. I was fine. I was safe. At least that was  what I was trying to say to myself, but deep down I knew I could never  be sure about that. No matter how many times I checked the doors and the  windows, how many times I checked to see if the kitchen knife was still  there, right by my side. I didn't know anything. I was defenseless.  
I was  afraid I was getting crazy. There was absolutely no way I wasn’t. An  exact replica of Olivia? The only possible and reasonable explanation  would be if she had a psycho twin lost at birth, but that would be even  crazier.

  
I had to call her, but I  was afraid she would think I’m insane. What if it was all just a bad  dream after all? A very realistic nightmare… No, it would be impossible.  The second time I got up, I had checked the fuel gauge. It had less fuel than  before. I had used the car. It was all real, at least the driving part.  
I  was waiting for the sun to rise before I left, to meet Olivia. I would feel safer that way. Since I  didn’t want to freak her out, I just texted her the following, instead of calling her:

  
“I’m  sorry for your brother, but something weird happened. We need to talk  in person. I’m not sure if I should text you this. Your place?”

  
For my surprise, she read the message almost instantly, as if she was waiting for my response.  
“Something very weird happened too. I agree, we have to talk. Come meet me at 8:00am, I should be home by then.” She replied.

  
I  was left speechless. What could possibly be happening? Was she in  danger? Were WE in danger? I started to panic. I was really nervous. Now  that things were starting to work out for me, this happens. In fact, I  was so nervous that my body started itching. Especially my neck.  
I waited with the knife in my right hand. My head was starting to shut down and eventually, it all became dark. I felt asleep.

  
When  I woke up, it was already 7:00am. Fortunately for me, I was still  pretty much well alive. I checked the phone, no new messages. I rushed  to the car and drove to her place. I couldn’t afford to sleep more than I  had slept.

  
My body was feeling weaker and weaker as time went by. I could only relate it to the fact I barely had slept out of pure terror. My hand was shaking and the entirety of my body was sweating. I felt like I was slowly passing out again. But I couldn't. I had to be stronger than my urge to sleep. The adrenaline I was feeling at that moment was keeping me awake. **I HAD TO BE AWAKE.**

  
I  drove as fast as I could, and I finally arrived. 5 minutes early. I  checked the front door. It was left open, as if she wanted me to come in  without making too much noise. And so I did. Even tho it was very suspicious, I knew I hadn't many options anyway. It was worth the risk.

  
The  house was very charming. I still remember every single detail from the  last time I had been there, for her birthday. Olivia is a very funny,  welcoming and attractive person, but she isn’t very social. She lives  with her brother and her old father. Barely any friends, none that I  have met. She dedicates an immense amount of time working in the office,  just like I do. That pretty much explains why we get along. I admire  her. Even if she is antisocial like me, at least she makes me happy. And besides that, the number of friends in your friend circle doesn't define you, does it?

  
I was looking for Olivia, but  I couldn’t find her. I was starting to get anxious. Was she really  here? Just before I headed to the kitchen, preparing myself to shout her  name  - thinking I had come there too early - I heard her voice. She was calling me - from downstairs. Was she  inside the basement? It almost felt like a trap. But I wasn’t that  stupid. I picked up one of the sharpest knifes in the kitchen and  followed the voice. If it was the replica, I was ready to fight for my  life. I had to protect Olivia and myself from this...creature.

The  wooden stairs were making a lot of noise. Each step was louder and  louder. Now that I come to think of this, I don’t remember her having a  basement the last time I came to her house. Once I turned on the lights,  I stopped hearing her voice. She was suddenly silent. Dead silent.  
As if this wasn’t creepy enough, the basement door shut. I heard some footsteps outside. And suddenly, I heard sobbing.

  
“Olivia? Is everything alright?” I shouted.

  
My neck was now itching even more. The skin was slowly...peeling off??? What in the hell was happening here?!

  
The last thing I heard was…  
“I’m sorry. My sister is hungry. I just love my brother too much...”

  
Then,  something hit my head, as hard as steel, even tho I'm not sure what could have hurt me that much. I dropped on the floor, and  even if I wish to tell you more about what happened, I wouldn’t be able  to tell. I can’t remember anything else besides the pain I was left  with. The feeling of dread; solitude. The only flash of memory I have is the intense laughing that was happening...inside my own brain, as if whatever hit me, had access to it.

  
I  woke up in my house, completely undamaged, in the back of my head. Whatever hit me didn't leave any marks. I was completely naked. I quickly rushed to the  mirror, and the only thing I was left with, besides despair, was a  faceless figure. I could barely distinguish my face features. There was a  nose, and a mouth. If I tried even harder, I could also notice my eyes.  But all…separate. I couldn’t recognize my own face. I couldn't see it. I started crying,  but I could not tell exactly why. I picked up the phone and looked at my pictures. I couldn't recognize any faces. Friends, family, people I just knew... None of them were recognizable. Except for her face. I felt alone and yet…somehow… I knew I  wasn’t. At least, not anymore. I looked at my phone once again to check the clock. My stomach was empty. **Now? It was time for dinner.**

Lacie spent that night, as well as the next few weeks in the hospital. I visited every day. I'd always rode my bike to and from school every day, so it was no real issue for me to be able to just come after school every day. Mom never questioned it, either; being that she wasn't around much anyways, plus she was mostly just happy that I could actually tell her I'd made a friend.

She didn't know about that night in the woods or about having to call the paramedics. I never told her. I didn't think she really needed to know, nor did I think she'd approve of the fact that I'd had someone over without asking her first. No, I just told her that Lacie was the new girl from school who I'd made friends with, who was now very sick.

Again, not a complete lie. Just perhaps not the whole truth, but in all honesty, it might as well have been to me at the time.

*"What was 'Mama tree'?"*

That was the biggest question on my mind throughout each visit. It was one I definitely would've asked, too, if it weren't for the fact that Lacie was catatonic at the time. When I asked the doctors what was going on, they said that they weren't sure really. Apparently, her internal organs were, in some way, shape, or form, mutating; becoming something else. They further explained that, whatever it was that was actually causing this to happen, was essentially drying her up from the inside out.

When I asked how, of course, they were just about as clueless as I was. But they also brought up something else. Something else that, believe it or not, actually confused the hell out of me even more than what was happening with her body. They told me that Lacie, Lacie Rhinehardt, the mousy-looking, 19 year old ginger haired girl, had gone missing almost ten years ago after supposedly being kidnapped.

At first, I didn't believe them. How could she have been 19 and missing for ten years, and *still* be 19 now? Not to mention, how could she have been alive now? If she escaped her captor, how'd she survive; alone and with no kind of food or water? How come she didn't seek help or anything?

Sure enough, though, they showed me a picture of her on an old newspaper in the "Missing Person's" column, dated ten years before. It was her, looking almost just like she did now, albeit a lot perkier. Obviously, they didn't have explanations for the other questions I mentioned. I knew they wouldn't. No, the only one who'd be able to answer any of that, like I said, was Lacie herself.

I asked the doctors when they thought she'd wake back up, to which they answered that it was hard to really tell, given how unnatural her condition was. The police were called at one point as well. They came to my house and asked me how I knew Lacie; if I'd known her back then, to which I replied that I didn't. I told them that she was just the new student at school a week or two ago and that we hung out once in the woods behind my house and that, after that, the whole thing with her body started happening.

They asked me if she talked about or mentioned anyone else to me. I told them she hadn't. They left soon after that, leaving me only all the more curious and hungry for *some* kind of answers. They say "where there's a will, there's a way". Well, I had a will, but seemingly no way. I couldn't talk to Lacie, and no one else would have any real explanations either. However, I wouldn't let this stop me.

It's almost funny to me, in a way. Solving this mystery gave me a feeling of growing closer to her, despite never knowing her before and not talking to her. If I could solve this mystery, I'd know Lacie better than anyone ever could. I'd have a story that'd beat any sort of fantasy novel I'd ever write. The first thing I did was to go digging around for anything related to what might've happened ten years ago.

Of such, I found next to absolutely nothing, save for a single headline with her picture; the same one the doctors showed me. Below, it listed her information; name, birthdate, height, weight, and last known location. I searched for a while longer to see if any suspects had been identified or if any arrests had been made. This, too, proved to yield no results until I found one, dated just a little while after the one of her disappearance, about three or four months later, about a man being found stabbed to death in the backyard a house located just at the edge of town.

They never found who'd done it, however, according to the article, it was said that multiple implements of captivity and torture had been found all throughout the house, such as ball gags, handcuffs, and metal pokers. Police thought the perp had tortured the poor bastard, given the blood coating each and every one of the instruments, before then running off into the woods.

The police supposedly looked into that case for at least three months before apparently going cold. It was said that, despite *allegedly* combing every inch of those woods, they found no sign of anybody. Just as I was about to move on from this though, I caught sight of something that made my heart stop dead. The address where the murder happened... *was mine!*

I couldn't believe it. *MY house*, someone was tortured and stabbed to death in *my house*, and I was never told, And they never found the guy that did it, either. That got me panicking. What if they were still out there? Sounds paranoid, I know, given that this happened a decade before, but still... Just makes you think, doesn't it?

I wondered then if Mom knew when she'd bought the house, coincidentally enough, not too long after those events would've occurred. I decided to ask her about it one day, one of the *VERY FEW AND FAR BETWEEN* ones she actually had off. I showed her the article I'd saved. I guess, unsurprisingly, she was just as shocked about this as I was. When she asked why I was looking into this, I told her about what I was told about Lacie.

This, too, was a shock to her, which by extension, made it all the more shocking to me. We'd lived in that neighborhood, that city, in *that house*, for YEARS! Me, my entire life. Yet, *neither* of us knew anything about this. That we lived in a neighborhood where both a teenage girl got kidnapped, as well as in a fuckin' *murder house!*

Now, most people would've stopped there, right? A shocking reveal (or two) and you'd think I could stop there, right? I mean, it wasn't like any of this led me any closer to the answers I was looking for... *or did they?*

*"Didn't she say something about this place being familiar?"* I wondered. That got gears turning in my head. I thought of the way she looked nervously around the place. This made me also wonder again, just how was it, exactly, that Lacie knew where the house was? Then, of course, the root question to all of this came back to me, what did she mean when she said she was "from the woods"?

*"What was 'Mama tree'?"*

The day finally came onw weekend, about two months ago now, when I could actually ask her these questions directly when she finally woke from her coma. It was a Saturday, I remember. I remember because Mom had told me that she was gonna be gone for the weekend. This meant, as usual, I'd have the house and all the time to myself. Obviously, I'd spend it with my friend.

She was still kinda groggy when I visited. "H-Hey... how're you feelin'?"

She groaned. "Wh-What happened?" She started jostling her head around. "Wh-Where am I?"

"It's okay." I said. "You're in the hospital." Her eyes went wide.

"The hospital?! Why?!" I could see her trying to move her body, still being too weak to really do so, outside of just lightly shuffling around. I put my hand on her shoulder.

"Calm down, everything's okay. You're just in the hospital because of what happened the other night at my place, remember?"

She stopped. "Huh?"

"My house, remember? You and me, watching "Lord of the Rings" together?"

She seemed to ponder this for a moment. "What's the last thing you remember?" I asked her. She closed her eyes.

"I... I remember trees."

I raised my eyebrow and asked, "Trees?"

"Y-yeah, trees; all around me. I remember you and me, walking, surrounded by tr--" She stopped dead and her eyes went wide. "*Trees!*" she exclaimed, "The woods, you and me! I showed you "Mama tree"! And then..."

"And then what?"

Her body seemed to relax a bit again and she said, "I could hear her. "Mama tree" was calling me home, but I didn't come. I remember feeling woozy and hot."

I bit my lip. I wasn't sure if I felt comfortable talking to her about any of this now. I could see that *something* about this had her in a bit of a tailspin. At the same time, though, I couldn't just let it all go, either. I mean, I felt like I was somehow connected in this now, too; connected to her.

"Lacie," I began hesitantly, "I need you to be straight with me, what happened ten years ago?"

"Wh-What do you mean?" she asked, looking nervously at me. She *knew* what I'd meant. I held up the "Missing photo" of her and her face said it all, almost immediately going stark white. Shaking, heart racing now, I asked her again.

"H-He grabbed me," she began, shuddering, voice starting to break. "I'd never seen him before, but he said he'd been watching me for a long time." I could see her eyes start to well up with tears. Her voice further cracking with each second, she went on, "H-H-He grabbed me from behind one day when I was walking home from school. I-I took the backways, you see? There was a shortcut to my house through the woods. He said no one would hear me scream." She choked back a sob. "And he was right."

"What do you mean? Who, and how'd he know where to follow you? Why was he following you?" I can't lie, despite feeling horrible for making her relive what was obviously the most horrific and frightening experience of her life, I just couldn't help myself.

She shrugged her shoulders and said, "I don't know. I really don't. All I knew was that he had me and I was too far from the main roads or anywhere else for anyone to hear me. I tried fighting him, but he put plastic bag over my head and held it there until I passed out. When I woke up, I was tied to a chair in a dark room. I tried screaming again, but I had a gag in my mouth."

Her face hardened into a malicious looking glare and she said in a deep, gruff sounding voice, *"Uh, Uh, Uh... Good girls don't scream, and only good girls get to have their gags taken out.* He said I was his toy to break!*"* Her face melted then into a flood of tears. I wanted to reach out to her, to hug or give *some* sort of comfort, but I didn't. I couldn't.

She continued, hysterical, "He would hit me over and over again, every day. I begged him to let me go, telling him I wouldn't tell anybody. Whenever I tried to fight, he'd hit me in the head with a fire poker and knock me out. When I'd wake up, I'd be cuffed to a bedpost, naked. He'd just leave me there, too, sometimes for days, before letting me out, telling me he'd leave me in there longer if I "misbehaved" again. He hardly fed me and was constantly hurting me."

She sniffed, clearing herself up, "I only managed to escape when I was lucky enough for him to leave a knife behind one night when he left me alone in the room. He didn't even try to cuff me, having battered me to the point where I was barely able to move. He'd left to go get something else to hurt me with. I was hurt, really bad. But I knew it was my only chance to get out alive. I grabbed the knife and as soon as he came back," she began grunting furiously while thrusting her arm forward in a stabbing motion.

She went limp again and started tearing up again as she said, "I got him! I killed him. He stabbed me, too, though, right here." She lifted up her gown and I saw a giant, faded scar that ran lengthways just above her bellybutton. "I tried to go through the woods, back to the main roads to try and get help. I was losing blood, fast. I was hurting so much and was already so weak. I thought I was gonna die. But then..." She sniffed and took a deep breath and said, "Then I found her, 'Mama tree'."

I stood, frozen, unsure if I could believe what I was hearing. I mean, yeah, it was everything I'd already proven myself, but even still, hearing it from her directly, it was just so surreal. So unbelievable. So *fantastic.* More than anything else, though, this was downright *visceral!*

"Wh-what... What happened then?" I asked, wincing in hesitation. She stayed silent for a moment, breathing heavily while staring at the wall behind me.

Finally, she sniffed and replied, "I couldn't go any further. I collapsed in front of her. Everything was about to go dark, when, all of a sudden, I start to feel something inside of me, making me feel strong. I felt the pain start to go away. When I looked, there was 'Mama tree', glowing, giving me her energy."

She smiled weakly and said, "She saved me, Hannah."

I swallowed hard. I could feel a lump form in my throat. "But you said she takes something from you as well, right?" Her smile fell and she nodded her head. "What is it?" I asked, honestly afraid of her answer.

She looked at her palms and replied, "She gives me her energy, in return, I relinquish mine."

"What do you mean?"

"I mean that, because I use her energy to stay alive, I give up some of mine to her. I take a part of her into me, while she takes parts of me into her. I become her, essentially. Eventually, I'll have taken so much of her energy that I'll merge completely with her. It's already far along in the process, too. I've been taking more and more to keep the pain away, but now the change is accelerating. I'm already becoming like 'Mama tree'."

Once again, I was speechless. Quite honestly, if I'd not actually *seen* at least some of this, of 'Mama tree', I'd have thought she was nuts. That whatever the hell was going on with her that night at my house had affected her mentally as well. But that's just it, I *did* see it. I'd seen it, and even the doctors had no actual explanation for what was happening to her body.

At the same time, though, how? How was that even possible? How could a *tree* do *that?* Not only that, But why did Lacie keep going back? Why did she stay in the woods instead of getting help?

"Lacie, why didn't you try to get help?"

"Help?" she cried. "How was anyone gonna 'help'? 'Mama tree' was, and is, the only thing keeping me alive. That's why I've been in the woods with her. She is my shelter and my protector."

"Yeah, but look what it's done to you. You said it yourself, it's destroying you. You can't keep doing this. You can't keep going back to 'Mama tree'." Despite feeling determined to keep her from destroying herself further, one thing did keep buzzing in my head.  A thought that was, almost ironically, voiced by her.

"And what am I supposed to do, huh? *You* said yourself that even the doctors don't know what's going on. If they can't fix it, who can?" With that, I was stumped. She was right. So then, what was I supposed to do?

Whether or not I kept her from 'Mama tree', she was still screwed. If I let her go back, according to her, she'd end up losing herself entirely to it. On the other hand, though, if I kept her away, like she was that night at my house, she'd degenerate there, withering away wherever she was. My eyes began to burn with tears.

"So that's just it, then?" I cried out. "You leave here and go back to your fuckin' tree and rot, is that it?"

She looked at me, her eyes full of both shame and desperation. She knew this was hurting me, about as much as it did her to have to admit it. "I-I'm..."

"No," I spat, "Don't even fuckin' say it. You know what, I don't care anymore. Go back, waste yourself to your 'Mama tree' or whatever." I turned and stormed out of the room without another word. I stormed down the halls and exited the hospital, taking my bike and heading home. The whole way, all I could think about was how hopeless I felt. That the first real friend I actually managed to make in a long time was essentially screwed, and there wasn't a damn thing I could do about it. I was angry, but yet, I knew it wasn't her fault.

She didn't have a choice. Like she said, she'd have been dead ten years ago, had it not been for the fact that she'd found 'Mama tree'. But that didn't make it any easier. That didn't change the fact that she was screwed, and I couldn't help her.

I got home to find Mom there. Almost immediately, my flood of emotions was replaced by just straight confusion. Mom was throwing things into the back of the car. She told me to go inside and grab my clothes and a few things I wanted to take with me. When I asked what was going on, why she was back so early, she told me that we were gonna be staying with my grandparents, a little ways back into town, while she looked for another house. She said she just wasn't comfortable staying in the house anymore after finding out what happened there (even though she wasn't even around that much anyway).

Regardless, I didn't argue. How could I, really? The way I saw it, the best thing about it, Lacie, was gonna end up a goner one way or another. What was the point of staying?

The remainder of the day was spent packing the few possessions we intended to bring with us for the short term into the car. Mom said that, once we'd settled at grandma and grandpa's, we could come back and get the rest of our stuff. That evening, we hit the road and arrived there at around 10:00 P.M.

I spent the rest of that week in basically a bit of a funk. I wouldn't come out or do anything, aside from going to school. At school, my performance was suffering more and more. I ended up bombing the first exam of the year because I just didn't give a fuck. I felt like nothing really mattered anymore.

With a little bit of time, though, I managed to sort of get myself together. To "move on", I guess. By the middle of last week, I was back to my old self again, more or less. I still felt a certain weight of sadness, but it didn't linger like it did at first anymore. Instead, it was basically a shadow, floating around the back of my head.

Until just yesterday.

I had just gotten home from school that day when grandma handed me the phone, telling me there was a message left for me. When I looked to see who it was, admittedly confused as to who'd ever try to call me, especially during the day while I was at school, I saw that the I.D. was listed as being from the hospital. I pressed the playback button and the following message played,

***"Hey Hannah, um... I-It's me, Lacie. Listen, I don't know when or even IF you'll ever hear this message, but I wanted to tell you two things. First, I wanna say that you're pretty cool. If things were different, I would've loved to hang out with you. For what it's worth, I did have fun with you that night, watching the movie together. The second thing, though, is to say that, yes, this is it. The doctors are letting me go. They've put in for some prescriptions that they think might "Stabilize my condition" or whatever. Heh... I guess we'll never really know, huh? No, Hannah, I'm going back. I've been away for too long. I just wanted to tell you that, though, and say goodbye. Oh, one more thing, please, whatever you do, DON'T ever try to use or find 'Mama tree'. You still have a life. Enjoy it, for me."***

All at once, about a million emotions flooded through me. I was torn, not knowing at all what I was supposed to do. On one hand, I had accepted that I couldn't keep her away, nor would it make any difference if I could. But at the same time, she was my friend, I couldn't just let her go alone, could I? I needed to be there, to be with her, even if it had to be for the last time. I dashed out of the house, hopped on my bike and sped off, making a beeline for the house.

**\*\*\***

The sun has set. Only rays are peeking out above the tree line. There's just barely enough of it for me to see them, Lacie and 'Mama tree'.

I've spent these last few hours, as I've written this, contemplating one big thing. At the hospital, Lacie explained that the exchange of energy between her and 'Mama tree' caused the two to essentially exchange their essences. Odd as this will sound, it's only now that I seem to understand, through hindsight, some of what happened with her.

She escaped captivity ten years ago with only a bare inch of her life. She was saved, however, by 'Mama tree' through it's supernatural properties (of which, admittedly, I still have no explanation for). But, like all things, it came with a price; her life. In order to even get by, for ten whole years, she had to keep taking from it, which in turn, meant she was taken from as well. She'd never be able to stop until now...

Until now, she'd be one with 'Mama tree'.

I guess it's because, in typing this out, I'm able to see the bigger picture that I wasn't before. I'm finally able to really put the story together. [The strangest, the saddest, the most haunting, as well as the single most fantastic story I’ll ever tell.](https://www.reddit.com/r/CorpseChildGospels/)

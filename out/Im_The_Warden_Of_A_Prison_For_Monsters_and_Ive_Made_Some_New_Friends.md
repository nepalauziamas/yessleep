It’s been a while since I’ve traveled.

&#x200B;

I don’t much need to. My work at Ashurst keeps me busy enough and I’ve already seen more of the world than most folks. Not that the world doesn’t change when you’re not looking… Put enough years behind you, and the world you know will become something entirely new. But I never thought there was a lot waiting for me in the new world. Taller buildings, new technology, and a shift in culture, but the same old people underneath it all. The former three come all come to my little corner of Arizona eventually and that last one has been there since before I was born. 

&#x200B;

That all said - I suppose Jared Moir should’ve been flattered that out of all the jackasses I’d had to put up with ever since settling down, he was the first one to piss me off so severely that I decided to hunt him down and put him in the ground myself. 

&#x200B;

Even that bitch, Kayla hadn’t inspired quite that much rage… Although I’d mostly left her be because I figured the FRB would deal with her. Upset as I was that she’d found a way to escape my little slice of Arizona, I never really thought of it as a personal attack. People in prisons generally have an interest in getting out. That she’d succeeded was incredibly frustrating, but hardly personal. 

&#x200B;

Of course, now that I knew she was the one who’d sent Moir, that had changed… With God as my witness, I aimed to put a bullet in both of them. 

&#x200B;

And I had an idea of where to start looking.

&#x200B;

I had no leads on Kayla. Far as I knew, no one in the FRB did. But I had a few ideas on where Moir might have run off to. His little group wasn’t the biggest out there, but I knew he had a few folks working under him, carrying out different jobs. He’d never given me the details and I’d never asked, but I recalled that he’d mentioned one of his lieutenants working for a client in New York a few weeks back. That seemed like the best place to start looking, and I just so happened to know someone in the area who might help me narrow my search a little. 

&#x200B;

I went back about a century with Benny Masters. Can’t say I liked him that much, but back during my bounty hunting days he proved a good enough resource. Benny had always liked making friends in high and low places. He was well connected, kept his ears to the ground, and was more than happy to share any information he came across for the right price.

&#x200B;

I knew he’d taken up the easy life in Manhattan and we’d stayed in touch, albeit not closely. He didn’t sound too thrilled when I called him from the airport as I waited on my flight out.

&#x200B;

  *“Parker. I’d say it’s been too long, but that might imply I missed you.”*

  “Yeah, nice to hear from you too, Benny.” I’d replied, “How’s city life treating you?”

  *“I can’t complain. I’ve settled down, invested my money, and got myself a nice little establishment with some reputable clientele. More reputable than yours… No offense.”*

&#x200B;

“Well, I wouldn’t have expected any less from you.” I said, “Hope you didn’t forget about your old clients though. If I recall correctly, you wouldn’t have most of that money if it weren’t for me…”

He paused for a moment, then chuckled quietly.

  *“I figured this wasn’t a social call…”* He said.

  “You owe a few favors. I’m just calling to collect.”

  *“Of course you are… Of course. So what exactly do you need?”*

&#x200B;

He hardly sounded enthusiastic but I could almost hear the jaded smile in his voice.

  “I’m looking for someone. A man by the name of Jared Moir. Ring any bells?”

  *“Vaguely. He’s a bodyguard or something, right? I remember hearing the name. What do you want with him?”*

  “He sicced four werewolves on me in my own prison.”

&#x200B;

That actually got a genuine laugh out of him.

*“That poor bastard…”*

  “I’ll be landing in New York this afternoon. Think you can get something on him for me by tonight?” I asked.

 *“Maybe.”* He said, *“I’ll ask around… You said you’ll be landing this afternoon, right? You can be here by tonight?”*

  “I can.”

  *“Then I might already have something for you. Are you familiar with the Darling Twins?”*

I paused.

&#x200B;

Any vampire with a brain knew about Mia and Lia Darling. The Darling Imperium was just about the closest thing our kind had to anything resembling organized leadership, although not everyone was particularly thrilled about that. I’d heard some describe them as little more than glorified crime lords running an ornate racket and others as a genuine support network for other vampires (so long as those vampires obeyed their rules). Personally, I had no real opinion on them. I knew they were powerful, both in terms of raw strength and influence and I knew they were ruthless. But I’d yet to hear about them causing much harm to anyone who hadn’t directly provoked them. 

&#x200B;

  “What about the Darling Twins?” I asked.

  *“One of them’s in town. Lia Darling and she just so happens to be entertaining some guests tonight in my lounge. Not a hell of a lot goes on that she and her sister don’t know about. Chances are, if there’s someone you’re looking for she’ll probably have an idea on where to find them. I’m on good terms with the Darlings. If you’re here by tonight, I can make an introduction so long as you promise not to make an ass of yourself.”*

&#x200B;

Now it was my turn to laugh.

  “Well, well… Guess you are moving up in the world after all, old man.”

  *“You doubted me?”* Benny asked, *“So, I’ll be seeing you tonight, then?’*

  “Tonight.” I said, “Thanks in advance.”

With that, I hung up. 

&#x200B;

I hadn’t been to New York in decades and the city was far different than I remembered. The urban sprawl seemed so unusual to me. I was used to quiet. This endless city in all directions was too much to take in all at once.

&#x200B;

I drove a rental from the airport to a cheap hotel and left my luggage there. Then I took the time to change into something a little more appropriate for a visit to Benny’s place before heading out. I opted for a button down shirt and a black blazer. A little dressier than what I was accustomed to and truthfully, I barely recognized myself in it. But the situation called for it. Benny may have been a little slimy, but he wasn’t running a dump. 

&#x200B;

I kept my .45 holstered under my jacket and as the sun started to set, I drove out to Bennys. His club had gone through a few name changes over the years as it passed from manager to manager. Like most vampires, he reinvented himself every few years. The last I’d heard, his club had been called something like ‘*The Tower*’. Now it was ‘*Cicada*’. Not sure I liked either name.

&#x200B;

Walking in, the loud music immediately made my head hurt. There were too many people around, grinding on each other and the smell of sweat and alcohol was everywhere. Looking up, I could see a lounge area atop some stairs, with a few lucky patrons away from the rest of the throng. And staring down at the masses was an olive skinned woman with straight blonde hair and a bored expression. 

&#x200B;

She wore a fairly plain gray cocktail dress that gave me a somewhat militant vibe. In one hand, she held a bone white goblet with a golden handle. I knew her just by looking at her. That was Lia Darling. 

&#x200B;

I went for the bar and ordered a whisky, before telling the bartender I was there for Benny. He just gave me a nod before sending his coworker off. About ten minutes later, the man himself arrived.

&#x200B;

Despite not having aged in several centuries, Benny still looked old. His salt and pepper hair had more gray in it than I remembered and I wasn’t sure if that was intended or not. His skin was somewhat wrinkled and had a leathery quality to it, but he greeted me with open arms.

&#x200B;

  “Elizabeth Parker. Long time, no see. You’re looking well!”

  “Immortality tends to do that.” I replied and he laughed, but it sounded fake.

I glanced back up at the lounge I’d seen Lia Darling in.

&#x200B;

  “Did you set up a meeting?” I asked.

  “I did. She’s not busy. You can go on up when you’re ready.” Benny said, “Just watch the attitude unless you want to end up on a cross…”

  “I’ll keep that in mind.” I said, before patting him on the shoulder, “Nice seeing you again.”

  “Yeah, yeah. Don’t say I never did you any favors.” Benny said, “Good luck up there.”

  “Thanks, Benny. I’ll stop by for a drink later.”

&#x200B;

With that, I left the bar and took the stairs up to the lounge. There were only a handful of people up there and just over half were vampires.

&#x200B;

Lia Darling sat on a large barrel chair, her goblet in hand. At one side was a woman with short dark hair and heavy eyeshadow and at the other was a man dressed in an immaculate black suit. Beside him was a woman with short, curly red hair and a few healing cuts on her face who looked more like a siren than a vampire. She looked like she’d recently gotten an ass kicking. Behind them stood several human partygoers, dancing as if they weren't in the presence of the closest thing to a Vampire Queen that existed. I could see bite marks on their arms, although they didn’t exactly look like they were suffering.

&#x200B;

  “Honestly Blair, I’m not sure why you bother…” Lia said, looking at the dark haired woman as she spoke. “Crush the lot of them and be done with it. If you’d rather keep your hands clean, then I’ll gladly do it for you. But an offense of that sort should not be allowed to stand.”

  “I appreciate your concern on the matter, ma’am. But I’ll have to decline. I’ve come up with a solution to deal with the problem in a more… Amicable, fashion.”

  “Amicable…” Lia repeated, then laughed humorlessly. She took a sip from her goblet. “Suit yourself. Although *when* you change your mind, I will be right here.”

&#x200B;

Her eyes darted to the side, fixating on me. She gently set her goblet down and sat back in her chair, crossing her legs as she did.

  “Miss Darling.” I said, nodding my head in respect. She didn’t reciprocate the gesture.

  “And you are…?”

  “Elizabeth Parker.”

  “Ah… The Warden. Benny told me to expect you. Sit down. Can I get you a drink? What’s your preference?”

&#x200B;

She gestured to some of the humans behind her.

  “Male or female?”

  “Either or.” I said.

Lia snapped her fingers and one of the women came over.

  “Victoria, give our guest a drink.” She said, before looking at the other two vampires around her, “I’ll catch up with you two later. Go have fun.”

&#x200B;

On cue, they both got up to leave, although the siren stayed behind. The woman, Victoria, approached me, leading me to a nearby chair before offering me her arm. It took me a moment to realize that she was expecting me to bite her… I’d never really had a human offer themselves to me like that before. I gingerly pushed her arm aside, before thinking better of it. If she was going to offer me fresh blood, refusing might not make the best first impression.

&#x200B;

I gently took the woman by the wrist and sank my fangs into her arm. Hot, fresh blood filled my mouth and it tasted better than any blood I’d had in a long while. She flinched in pain but didn’t pull back. She just put on a warm smile as I fed. All the while, Lia Darling sat and watched me as I drank what I needed.

&#x200B;

  “She’s good, isn’t she?” She asked as I let the humans arm go, “My sister and I are fond of her… How are you feeling, Victoria?”

Victoria just gave a slight nod.

  “I’m okay, ma’am…”

  “Good. Go rest, then. Relax.”

&#x200B;

Victoria smiled one more time and left, babying the arm I’d bitten her on. I watched her go, before looking over at Lia who wore a wry smile.

  “This is new to you, isn’t it?” She asked, “I imagine you’re not used to being offered fresh blood… I can see it written all over your face.”

  “Not exactly, no.” I admitted.

&#x200B;

  “We live in a brave new world.” Lia said, “Personally, I’ve never had any problems with hunting for my own prey… I almost prefer it. But as the world gets smaller and smaller, some compromises must be made. I won’t pretend it isn’t nice to have willing blood on demand though.”

  “I never thought humans would consent to being fed on.” I said.

&#x200B;

  “Provide enough incentive, and anyone will consent to just about anything.” Lia replied, “We take care of our blood. We make sure they live well, that they have time to recover between feedings and that they’re properly compensated for what they give.”

  “That just sounds like blood farming with an air of pretension,” I said and Lia laughed. It was a cold, hollow chuckle with no humor in it. 

&#x200B;

  “If you want to reduce it to that, then be my guest. My sister considers it far more ethical though. The relationship is more symbiotic than parasitic. We take care of them and they take care of us. I believe in quid pro quo. It’s the rock upon which we’ve built our church, but I digress… You didn’t come here to talk ethics. Benny tells me you’re looking for someone.”

  “Two people.” I said, “A werewolf by the name of Jared Moir and a siren named Kayla Del Rio.”

&#x200B;

The redheaded siren in the lounge with us seemed to perk up at the name. She glanced at Lia, but didn’t say anything. Lia’s expression remained unchanged. She took another sip from her goblet.

  “I’m afraid I can’t help you with Del Rio.” She said, “You’re not the first to come looking for her. Shelby here was on her trail when she came to us and I regret that I’ve been unable to help her.”

She gestured to the siren, who was watching me intently.

&#x200B;

  “What about Moir?” I asked, “I know he’s working for Kayla. If I find him, I might just find her.”

Lia raised an eyebrow. 

  “Is he now? I knew Moir had no standards, but that sounds low even for him. If you don’t mind me asking, why is it you’re looking for him? Kayla, I understand. I heard she’d caused quite the scene at Ashurst when she broke out. But Moir… What’s he done to you?”

&#x200B;

  “He tried to kill me a couple of days ago. I’m looking to return the favor.”

  “Revenge? I can respect that.” Lia replied, “I’ll be completly honest with you, I have no idea if Moir’s currently in town at all or not. I do know he has dealings in New York. However, quid pro quo. If you want information out of me, I’ll require something out of you.”

I grimaced.

  “What exactly did you have in mind?” I asked.

&#x200B;

  “Nothing dramatic, I promise. In fact, it’s fortunate that you’ve come to me when you have. Moir’s lieutenant in town is a man by the name of Tom Nelson. Now, I personally don’t give a shit about Nelson. But I am interested in the man he’s currently working for. Shawn Currie, a vampire we used to deal with.”

  “Used to?” I asked.

&#x200B;

  “Up until about six months ago, we used Currie as a supplier. He’s good at getting things that might not be strictly legal. We mostly used him to distribute our blood reserves. Working with him was more efficient than going through the legal channels. I’ll admit, we knew the man was an opportunist. We just never expected him to go behind our backs. We noticed the shipments he’d been in charge of were coming in light. Turns out he’d been keeping some of our donated blood and selling it to some less than reputable vampires. Personally, I would’ve killed him just for that but my sister was inclined to be merciful. We terminated our business relationship and barred him from the privileges and protections offered by our Imperium. Currie took it about as well as expected. He’s caused a good deal of trouble for some of our other associates in retaliation… And I’ve got a very good reason to suspect he’s behind the recent disappearance of some of our donors… He’s been falling deeper and deeper into the blood farming crowd since we parted ways although I suppose he hasn’t devolved into a complete idiot since he at least had the sense to hide under a rock and hire bodyguards… Hence his employment of Nelson and Moir.”

&#x200B;

  “So he’s hiding from you.” I said.

  “He thinks he is. The only reason he’s still alive right now is because I’ve had more important things to do than chase down a bottomfeeder like that. But since you’re looking for his bodyguard, why not kill two birds with one stone? Kill Currie and I’ll consider it a personal favor.”

  “That’s all? You’ve got a deal?” I said, and Lia cracked a knowing smile.

&#x200B;

  “I thought you’d say that… Currie’s currently looking after a small blood farming operation just outside the city. I can give you the address. It’d be easy to miss if he hadn’t hired the guards. They sort of give it away, but I digress… Nelson and Currie are the best leads I can offer you. I’m sure one of them will know where Moir is, assuming he’s not already there in person.”

  “Either way, I’m a step closer.” I said, standing up. “Thanks for the help, Miss Dar-.”

  “Lia is fine.” She said, “If you make it back alive, let me know if you need anything else. The Imperium along with all of our resources are available to you.”

&#x200B;

I nodded.

  “Much obliged, Ma’am.”

  “Don’t mention it at all. Good luck.”

With that, I left the club.

&#x200B;

Benny had sent me the address of the blood farm Currie was running shortly after I’d left. It was about an hour outside of New York, in a more run down looking suburban area. A lot of the houses were either boarded up or looked as though they should have been. The few people I saw out and about looked like they’d lived hard lives.

&#x200B;

I didn’t know a lot about blood farms, but I knew they preyed on people like these. People with nowhere else to really go. I drove slowly through the suburban streets, feeling somewhat out of place as I did, and not entirely sure what to expect waiting for me up ahead.

It wasn’t long before I saw the house itself, and while my expectations hadn’t been high, I still can’t help but admit that I’d been expecting something nicer.

Once upon a time, it had probably been someone's dream home. Victorian style, three floors, and red brick that must have once been expensive. However, the house looked completely abandoned and on the verge of collapse. Parts of it seemed to buckle in a few places and some of the brick walls looked ready to crumble. There was no yard or driveway. Just dead land surrounding it and a chain link fence keeping trespassers out. Like almost every other house on the block, it looked as though it was ready to be demolished. 

&#x200B;

I parked on the street outside and got out of my car. I checked the address Benny had given me again… It had to be the red house. Looking at it, it was the only one that looked like I could even go inside. The doors and windows of the other condemned houses were boarded up.

&#x200B;

But there wasn’t a single sign of life here. I’d been told that Currie was supposed to be heavily guarded. Had he already moved on? Was I at the wrong address? Only one way to find out.

&#x200B;

I still had my .45 on me, under my jacket. As I got out of the car, I considered reaching for it, but thought better of it. If anyone was in there, they probably wouldn’t recognize me. The best approach might be to come in as a potential customer. 

&#x200B;

I started towards the building and as I got closer, I saw movement behind the windows. Someone was definitely in there.  

&#x200B;

As I got closer to the door, I saw it open in anticipation of my arrival. Two men were waiting for me inside, with a third coming down the hall. I could smell the werewolf on all three of them.

&#x200B;

The man coming down the hall was nothing short of massive. He wasn’t particularly tall but he was extraordinarily stout. He was wide enough that he seemed to block the entire hallway and had absolutely no neck. He had a notable underbite and four malformed sausage shaped fingers on each hand. He wore a fur lined bomber jacket and was completely bald. 

&#x200B;

  “You got an appointment?” He asked me. His voice was low and grumbly.

  “No, but I’ve got friends.” I replied, “Just passing through town. Heard this was a good place to grab a drink.”

The stout man grunted, before gesturing to the two men beside me.

&#x200B;

  “Full disclosure, I am armed.” I said as they gave me a quick pat down. They found my .45 almost immediately. “Rough looking neighborhood, and all.”

One of the men took my gun and handed it to the stout man. He inspected it, before turning away and gesturing for me to follow.

  “You’ll get it back when you leave.” He said gruffly, “Come. What’s your preference? A man? A woman? A child?”

&#x200B;

My eyes narrowed.

  “How much prey have you got?”

  “Six currently. Two resting. Half our prey are locals. We keep them clean enough to feed on. We have one child for those that want it… Some prefer their blood young. Standard price is $200 for an adult. $300 for the child. The price doubles if you kill them. We also have two from the Darlings private stock. They’re more expensive. $500. Triple if you kill. But I’m told the blood is better… For now. The quality degrades quickly, so better to drink them up fast… What’s your preference?”

&#x200B;

  “Do your usual patrons kill your prey?” I asked.

  “Some prefer the full experience.” The stout man said, “I’m told that killing one of the Darlings stock is the most satisfying… Nothing like reminding some privileged meat of their rightful place, right?”

  “Couldn’t agree more.” I replied, forcing a smile.

  “So… You’re a killer. What’s your preference? One of the Darlings humans?”

  “I’ll think it over…” I said, “By any chance, is the boss in? Was hoping to get a word with him?”

&#x200B;

The stout man frowned.

  “He’s unavailable. You eat, or you leave. Make up your mind.” 

  “Fine… Give me one of the Darlings stock, then.” I said. “But let him know I stopped in. I’m a friend of Jareds and I’ve got a message for him.”

The stout man was still staring at me, his eyes narrowed. He was silent for a moment before grunting and turning away. He gestured for me to follow again as he led me down the hall. As we walked, I caught a glimpse into some of the rooms.

&#x200B;

Hagged looking people sat on bare beds, the marks from past feedings on their arms and shoulders. Most of them barely looked alive and just seemed to stare vacantly ahead. My stomach turned at the sight of them…

I’m no stranger to brutality. I’ve done a lot of shit in my time… But this seemed downright inhumane. Compared to this, the inmates at Ashurst lived like Kings. 

&#x200B;

  “You have cash to pay up front, yes? $1500 if you’re killing one of the Darlings stock. No negotiations. We get our money one way or the other.”

  “Don’t worry.” I assured him, “I’ll make sure you get what you’re owed.”

The stout man opened a door at the end of the hall and gestured towards it.

  “In here.”

&#x200B;

I joined him by the door and stepped inside, only to look around in confusion. I was expecting some disheveled room with a wide eyed, horrified human staring back at me, waiting for me to sink my fangs into them. Instead, I was looking at a dingy bathroom.

&#x200B;

I looked over at the stout man for an explanation only to feel his meaty fist slam into my face and knock me into the room. I crashed into the sink, then hit the floor hard.

&#x200B;

  “A friend of Jareds, huh?” The stout man asked, chuckling. “Because he told you he was in New York, yes?”

I tried to pick myself up only for the stout man to grab me by the back of my shirt and slam me into the sink. The porcelain shattered and left cuts all over the side of my face. He yanked me to my feet and tossed me back out into the hall.

&#x200B;

  “Red hair… Strange accent… I know who you are, Warden. He thought you might come looking for him. And he thought you might start with me.”

Tom Nelson grabbed me by the hair and dragged me along the floor, kicking and writhing all the while.

  “Guess I’m finishing his job for him then…” 

&#x200B;

He dragged me into what had probably once been either a living room or a dining room and tossed me forward, before reaching into his pocket to take out my gun. 

  “Nelson, what the hell are you doing?” 

&#x200B;

Another man had appeared behind him. This one was scrawny and wearing a beige suit. I was willing to bet that this was Shawn Currie.

  “Working.” Nelson replied, glancing over at him. “There’s a hit on this one.”

  “So you’re going to just shoot her in the middle of my fucking establishment?” 

   “Yup…”

Nelson leveled the gun at me, but Currie grabbed his arm.

&#x200B;

  “For Gods sake, at least get her out of here first! Use your fucking brain, do you want people to come here investigating a goddamn gunshot?!”

  “In this neighborhood?” Nelson scoffed, before pulling out of Curries grasp. The two men locked eyes for a moment before Nelson finally let out a huff of frustration.

&#x200B;

  “Fine…” He slipped my gun back into his pocket and removed his bomber jacket, “I’ll do it quietly, then…”

I watched his thick sausage fingers grow and warp into animalistic claws. His eyes took on a yellowish glow as he approached me again. Currie let out a frustrated sigh and rolled his eyes.

  “Fine. Do it your way. Just do it quickly. And make it quiet! No gunshots!”

&#x200B;

I tried to pick myself up to get away, but Nelson just caught me with a backhand and sent me back to the ground. Before I could move, I felt him grabbing me by the throat with his still human hand. He was strong enough to crush my windpipe with ease and I could feel him lifting me off the ground. I could see stars as he suffocated me and I was certain I could feel the bones in my neck popping. If he didn’t strangle me, he could’ve probably broken my neck. 

&#x200B;

Currie was already leaving when I heard it. Several gunshots from outside.

&#x200B;

In an instant, Currie’s eyes were wide. Nelson paused and looked back towards the hall.

  “She’s not alone…” Currie said, “Nelson! Deal with it!”

&#x200B;

In the moment that he was distracted. I kicked up, driving my shoe into Nelsons groin. He let out a pained huff before looking back at me, grimacing in pain. I lifted my feet to brace them against his massive chest and pushed off of him before kicking up. I hit him in the chin and his head jerked up violently. His grip on my throat released and I hit the ground hard.

&#x200B;

Currie had already disappeared into the hall. It was just me and Nelson now. 

&#x200B;

Nelson snarled as his body began to change more violently. His already massive frame seemed to bulge out even more as he went full Wolf. I’ve seen a lot of werewolves in my time… But I’ve never seen one that big. I wasn’t exactly sure how the hell I was supposed to kill him. He seemed to fill the entire room, a colossus of muscle, teeth, and fur. 

&#x200B;

I spotted his discarded bomber jacket nearby and dove for it, only for him to grab me by the leg and hurl me across the room. He wasn’t fast enough though. I’d just grabbed the jacket in time and as I crashed against the exposed brick wall, my gun slipped out of his pocket. 

&#x200B;

His body still changing, Nelson let out an animalistic howl before charging at me. I heard three more gunshots and watched him freeze, before glaring over at the doorway into the living room.

&#x200B;

The red haired siren I’d seen with Lia stood there, a 10mm pistol in her hands. She fired a few more rounds at Nelson, who raised one massive arm to shield his face. I grabbed for my .45 and put a couple of shots into Nelsons side. Those made him flinch and he collapsed onto his side. Not dead, but wounded. His eyes violently darted between me and the siren, frantically trying to decide which of us was the bigger threat.

&#x200B;

I looked over at the siren, and caught her watching me out of the corner of her eye, her gun still trained on Nelson.

  “Get Currie!” I called to her, “I’ve got him.”

She just gave a quick nod and took off. I saw Nelson try and get up to go after her, so I put a couple more bullets in him. That got his attention.

&#x200B;

He let out a frustrated snarl before charging for me again. But this time, I was ready for him. I dove out of the way. He tried to turn, but he was too big and moving too fast. He skidded into the wall just behind where I’d been. The sheer weight of him made the brick buckle a little more. Dust poured down from the ceiling as the entire building seemed to lurch. Out in the hall, I could see some of the prey fleeing their rooms. 

&#x200B;

Nelson seemed to see it too and I could see rage smoldering in his eyes. My pulse was pounding in my ears. He reared up to come for me again, and I fired at his head. One of those bullets should have killed him. It tore a chunk out of his skull. But I guess the big dumb bastard hadn’t needed that part of his brain. He didn’t seem to slow down and I couldn’t get out of his way fast enough this time. 

&#x200B;

He tackled me to the ground, his immense weight crushing me. I pressed the barrel of my gun into his ribs and pulled the trigger, again and again until I heard the gun click. I could see blood smearing against the ceiling but Nelson didn’t even seem to slow down. My heart was racing with both adrenaline and sheer terror. He wasn’t dying! God damn it, why wouldn’t the son of a bitch just die?!

&#x200B;

He curled one clawed hand into a fist and brought it down like a hammer towards my head. I barely had enough room for him to miss and his fist broke through the floor beneath us. Screaming in exertion, I jammed the barrel of my gun into the wound I’d just made and twisted it. That finally got a reaction. Nelson let out a pained scream and let up just long enough for me to pull myself out from under him. 

&#x200B;

The entire house seemed to shake. I saw the walls shifting as bits of brick gave way. Nelson pressed a hand over his wound, glaring at me for a moment before he seemed to realize what I already knew. This little skirmish had been the straw that broke the camels back… The house was too run down and it was coming down. 

&#x200B;

The back wall he’d crashed into earlier buckled first. Part of the ceiling came down with it and all of it came down on Tom Nelson. One minute he was there, and the next there was nothing but rubble.

&#x200B;

I turned to run. Going through the hall wasn’t an option anymore. That was collapsing too. The only place to go was out one of the shattered windows. Thank God I was on the ground floor. I leaped over the windowsill and stumbled onto what used to be the porch. Looking back, I could see the house buckling under its own weight.

&#x200B;

I saw Currie falling from one of the windows on the second floor, although he didn’t look like he’d been given the option of jumping. He landed on the rotten wooden awning over the porch and fell through. Behind him, I saw the siren leaping out. She had a more graceful landing.

&#x200B;

I ran towards Currie, grabbing him by the shirt and dragging him away from the house before the walls gave out completely. The roof caved in as the house collapsed in on itself in a plume of dust. 

&#x200B;

The siren stared back at it, then down at Currie, who looked at the ruins of the building with wide eyed terror.

  “What did you… How… I…”

&#x200B;

I just clocked him across the face with my pistol, then grabbed him by the shirt and put the barrel against his head.

  “Jared Moir…” I demanded, “Where the fuck is he?”

  “I… I… Don’t…”

I hit him again.

  “MOIR! Tell me or I’ll blow your fucking brains out!”

&#x200B;

  “Jesus Christ! Okay! H-he’s at the scrapyard! The one just on the far side of Staten Island… Where they leave the boats! I’ve got a partner out there… He… He’s working on some kind of deal… That’s all I know! Don’t fucking shoot me! Please!”

I glared at him, before lowering my gun and letting him drop. Currie exhaled a sigh of relief. He looked like he was on the verge of tears.

  “T-thank you…” He rasped, “Oh God, thank you…”

  “Save your breath. Don’t thank me yet.” I said, before holding up my gun.

“I’m out of bullets.”

&#x200B;

The siren approached him from behind and as she did, Currie looked at her with his eyes slowly going wider.

  “But I’m not.” She said, pressing her gun against his forehead, “Lia Darling says hi.”

  “Wait… Wait no… NO!”

&#x200B;

The siren pulled the trigger and Currie hit the ground, eyes still wide and mouth open in a silent, final scream.

&#x200B;

The Siren and I traded a look before she calmly gestured towards my car.

  “Shall we?” She asked.

I wasn’t inclined to tell her no.

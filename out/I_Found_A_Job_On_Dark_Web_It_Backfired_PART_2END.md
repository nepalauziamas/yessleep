[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v49rfh/i_found_a_job_on_dark_web_it_backfired_part_1/)

I couldn't rush my decision or my plan, I had to keep a low profile not to look suspicious. I kept working with him, focusing on his routine and what he did during, and after the work. I had to know more about T for my plan to be put in motion. 

While I was studying T, something clicked in my mind, I didn't know where T lived. We would usually finish the work and he would head in deeper into the forest while I would make my way out of it. I only know this because I stayed a bit later after we finished work, hiding in the woods watching him. 

He would always stay inside the warehouse after me, waiting for me to leave before he did so himself. One friday night, we had more bodies delivered to us than we were used to, most likely a gang shooting but I didn't know, nor did I want to. 

It was already past my usual working time but I had already started getting rid of one of the bodies, so I told T I would stay an hour or 2 longer to finish it up and that he can go home if he wants. T agreed. He told me to lock up behind me when I was finished. 

This is the opportunity I was waiting for, I'm finally be able to follow him into the woods to see where he lived. I acted natural as he changed clothes and after he left I waited for a bit before opening the door myself. 

I grabbed a pack of bandaids and slowly followed him into the woods, making sure I wouldn't make any sounds. I stuck the bandaids on trees to be able to find my way back to the warehouse. I followed him, navigating the woods with precision so I don't step on any branches. 

After about 10 minutes I could see a small clearing and a house inside of it. As I neared it to get a better look I wasn't paying attention to the ground anymore. I stepped on a branch and it cracked loudly under me. I instinctively ducked under a bush as I saw his head snap back. 

My heart was pumping in my chest threatening to jump out any minute. Adrenaline was rushing trough my body but after about a minute of nothing happening I peeked out slowly. I saw him getting to the front door of the house as he glanced one last time at the woods behind before he went in. 

I calmed my breathing down a bit as I made my way back to the warehouse, making sure to take every bandaid off of the trees so that he wouldn't see them. I got back, finished up the body that I promised I would, and made my way back to my friends house. 

When I got back to my house, I couldn't sleep, the only thing I could focus on was how to find a way how to get into the house itself. The task wasn't going to be easy and it would take a lot of risk but if it worked, it would be a big step closer in making my plan a success. 

The next day at work I got there a bit later and as I was changing my clothes I decided to look trough his clothes if he had a key to the house. I peeked out of the room, and when I was sure he wasn't close I looked trough his clothes. At first I didn't find anything, until I got to his coat that was hanging on the wall. I put my hand in the left pocket and I felt keys, when I got them out of the pocket I noticed there was 2 keys that looked similar to the ones for our warehouse, but they weren't the same. 

I decided to change one of the keys for my own warehouse key, hoping it was the key to his house. I had my fingers crossed he wouldn't notice the difference, at least not immidiately. I had to wait for him to get distracted by something, however, so that I could have enough time to swap the keys. 

I didn't have to wait for too long, because he got a call to pick up a body. That was my opportunity to change one the keys with my own. I changed as fast as I could, not wasting any more time than necessary. 

I got back to work, holding in my excitement. In the meantime T came back with the new body and the day went by as usual. Once we were finished I pretended to go home but I hid behind one of the trees and waited for T to start making his way back to his house. 

I followed him carefully, this time not needing the bandaids since the way back was still fresh in my memory, and it wasn't that difficult. I made sure not to make any noises to alert him this time, calculating every step I took. Too much was at stake and I had gotten too far to get caught. 

He made his way into his house and closed the door. I decided to stay there and watch him for a while, hoping he would decide to go somewhere. I decided to make my way a bit closer but still hiding in between the trees in case he decided to come out again. 

I watched him for an hour or so, before the lights in the house turned off. I figured he was most likely going to sleep so I decided to call it a night and try my luck again tommorow. 

When I got back to my friends house he was already waiting for me. He said he had something important to talk about.
We sat down and he started talking about my parents and my ex girlfriend missing at the same time. I played dumb, acting like I didn't know what could have possibly happened to them. I was heartbroken so I didn't have to fake my tears when I cried. He said he was sorry that he even brought that up but something about it was bugging him so he just wanted to know if I knew who could've done it. 

I said no and as I turned to leave he said "You should take a break, you've been working overtime a lot lately from what I can see." 

I just nodded my head as I kept my eyes to the ground, feeling disgusted by what I've done with my life. 

The next day went as usual, we worked on some bodies until it was time to go home. Just like the night before, I waited for him to leave and followed him back to his house. This time I was feeling a bit more courageous and I got even closer to the house. I tried to see something trough his windows but I couldn't see much of interest. 

That is untill lights in one of the rooms turned on and he went into it. It looked like an office and he looked inside one of the drawers as he pulled out a file and dialed a number on his phone. It seemed like the person on the other side picked up and after a while of them talking, they hung up. After some more time has passed the lights went out once again. I made my way back to my friends house and went to sleep. 

That night I had nightmares and I couldn't sleep well. Something in my mind told me I saw something I shouldn't that night. I went to work but I noticed how T was in a much friendlier mood than before, even cracking couple of jokes. I endured through it and when the time came I followed him back to his house. I took the same spot I had the night before but this time the lights turned off really early and I saw T getting out of the house and making his way back to the warehouse. 

I didn't know what he was up to, but this may have been my only chance to get into his house and look around. When I made sure he was gone I rushed to the house and unlocked it. I went in and decided not to turn on any lights, using the flashlight on my phone instead. I made the way to what I assumed was his office and I shined my light over the file that was on his table. 

The file said "Darren Johnson". That was my name, why did he have my full name on a file when I never even told him any of my information. I opened the file and I felt my heart sink to my stomach. He had all of the information about about my parents and my ex girlfriend. 

My parents and my girlfriend were scratched off but there was one more person at the bottom of the page that wasn't. It was my friend that took me in to live with him, under his information it said "Hit, 5am when he's leaving for work." 

I was shocked I didn't know what to think. If I was right my friend is the one that's going to be killed next, possibly tommorow as he is leaving for work. I couldn't let that happen, I already lost too much to these monsters. 

I got out of his house, locked the door and rushed back to my friends house. I spent the night phisically and mentally preparing myself for all of the scenarios that could happen. 

I took one of my friends work outfits from our closet and decided to go out at 4:40am. I knew the hitman would be somewhere where he could see my friend leaving the house and I knew he wouldn't use a pistol unless he absolutely had to, we were living in the city after all. 

I leave the house and turn down one of the alleys after a minute of walking. I walked for a bit and then stopped, pretending to be looking at my phone. What I was actually looking at was the reflection behind me. 

I saw a man silently approaching, unaware I can see him as he silently pulled out a knife from his waistband, I did the same, just less noticably. I had to time this perfectly, I had the element of suprise but he was a trained hitman. I waited for him to get close enough that I would be able to attack him. I turned around and swung my knife in a horizontal motion where his throat was. 

He gurgled and a look of shock enveloped his face as he fell down and took last of his breaths. I took his phone and saw a familiar number that belonged to T in his recent contacts. It said Taylor, so I guess now I know his name too. I took the phone with me and put the body in the trunk of my car. 

I drove to the usual location we picked up the bodies from and I callee Taylor. I told him the body was ready and he hung up the phone. I hid in one of the bushes nearby and waited for Taylor to come. When he came and went to the body I could see his body tense up. 

I slowly made my way out of the bushes and cocked the gun that I took from the hitman. He turned around fear on his face. 

"What the fuck are you doing? Put that down now!" He yelled even though we both knew he didn't have any control of the situation. 

"Why?" Is the only thing I said, leveling my gun to his head. 

"Listen, I wanted to make sure you wouldn't have a reason to leave, I needed a partner and you did well!" He said as I looked at him with disgust. 

"Yeah, bad move." I said as I pulled the trigger three times, his body falling lifeless on top of the hitman. 

This has brought me to insanity, I couldn't live a normal life, not anymore, not after all of the shit I did. I'm a criminal now, and I have to accept it. 

I'm sorry, but I have to leave, someone called the number from my ad on the dark web, and I need a new partner, I have 2 bodies to clean up.

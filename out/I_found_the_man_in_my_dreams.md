 

I just bought a new house out in rural Montana. My wife and I have work-from-home jobs, and we don't talk to friends outside of FaceTime. We spent money on satellite internet and were ready for the wilderness. It was a middle-aged couple we bought it from, they seemed really nice. We were overjoyed that we found such a cute cabin. My wife was basically like a little kid going to Disneyland.

I went to bed that first night feeling pretty good about everything. I then seemed to wake up in the woods outside my house. I was assured that everything was okay, and I walked out. I walked through the forest, for some reason, before I stopped. A humanoid figure, lingering in the distance, too far to see details, but I could tell some stuff. It was freakishly tall, about 9 feet. It has long arms and long legs, but a very small stomach. I was confused, but then actually woke up. I was sweating heavily. My wife thought I was going insane. I told her it was just a bad dream and moved on. I worked that day and finished a lot of stuff because I had taken off the next week from work for like a housekeeping thing. I worked with my wife the next day, and went back to bed feeling a little uneasy, but still alright.

I woke up in my kitchen, my head bleeding out. I felt extremely nervous, considering what I saw last night. I walked through the forest, looking for that thing. I found it, looking directly at me. It had a wide grin, even though when I saw it yesterday, it had no mouth. I ran back, but actually woke up when I ran and fell off my bed. My wife asked me if it was the same dream. I said, "Yes and no, it had a mouth this time." She thought I was going crazy. I went to the local doctor, and he said nothing was wrong. I also kind of felt like I was going crazy.

I went out back at night to go grab some wood for the fireplace, and I saw it. It seemed to say something inaudible out of its mouth, but it also had eyes. It then spoke louder. It said, "You don't know what you got yourselves into. My soldiers did their job. Then, the couple walked into the forest from behind him. "You gave us a fun one," they said. I looked in terror. "Welcome," he told me. I ran back to the cabin and jumped into the house. My wife grew taller and had red eyes. She said, "Wow, you really fell into this. Good luck now." I looked but then ran into my car. I drove away, but they followed me. All of them.

I ran out and into my trunk. I've been holding the door, but I don't think it is going to last much longer. I don't know what is going to happen after that, but that's where I am now. I needed to get [this out before it's too late.](https://reddit.com/r/itscontho)

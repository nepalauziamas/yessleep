  My husband and I are avid ghost hunters/abandoned building adventurers. The following is the account of our final exploration...

* &#x200B;

“We are not going to make it in time” I reminded Brad, yet again. You see, a storm was approaching. I’m not talking about some flashes of lightening and a little rain, oh no; this was supposed to be a once in a lifetime blizzard. I’m talking anywhere between 10 and 25 inches was expected over the next few hours. And here we were, exploring an abandoned hospital located over an hour away from home. 

My husband Brad looked over at me with that shit eating grin I fell for on our first date. “Cora, chill. This is the best time to go, all emergency crews are diverted elsewhere and there is a hotel 10 minutes from the hospital. We are fine.” He said half reassuringly and half sarcastically.

“ I guess we don’t have a choice now, we are way too far to turn back” I begrudgingly replied. This was typical of our relationship; Brad, the adventurer and me, Cora, the cautious one. 

As we pulled into the overgrown lot, I was taken aback by how big the hospital was. The hospital was open from the 1930s to the mid-90s and was rumored to be haunted. Now, I’ve been to my fair share of “haunted” attractions and never experienced anything that could be defined as “otherworldly”, so I didn’t have high expectations of this place; plus, the threat of the snowstorm kept my thoughts occupied. 

Brad parked the car and glanced around at the empty lot. “See? What did I tell you? No one is here and this place is too old to have cameras.” He was so excited he was short of breath. “I’ll grab the bolt cutters, you’re on filming duty” Brad instructed. I stepped out of the car, shivering in the biting cold wind and grabbed my phone to record. 

The front door looked like a typical hospital door, clear glass with a handle directing you to “pull” which would be impossible at the moment since it was sealed with a heavy padlock. Brad was already working on the lock with the bolt cutters, unfortunately this was proving to be more difficult than expected. I stepped away for a cigarette while Brad worked on the lock. As the smoke infiltrated my lungs the urge to run suddenly hit me like a speeding train, “We shouldn’t be here” I mumbled under my breath, suddenly noticing my heart beating in my ears. 

I was startled out of my thoughts by a loud THUNK he got through the lock. He looked so proud I almost felt bad for wanting to leave. “Let’s go!” Brad yelled over to me. “Okay, but seriously we can’t stay longer than 20min” My voice shook as I spoke. “Fine fine.” Brad waved me off. I began walking over to him and pulled on the door, it opened easily, and we stepped inside. 

Immediately, I was struck by how…normal everything looked. When you think of an abandoned hospital you think of…well…an abandoned hospital with debris and dust covering everything. But there was no dust, not one speck. “How does it look so clean?” I asked, stunned. “This hospital has been closed for at least 25 years” I tried the lights and was shocked when the room lit up. “How have they not cut the power?” I tried to stuff the familiar urge to run deep inside my throat and began filming. 

If Brad was unnerved by the state of the hospital lobby, he didn’t show it. “This is great!” he said happily and clapped his hands. “Well, let’s start looking around” Brad started walking through the halls. I stayed behind; the cleanliness of the lobby was enough of a mystery to me. 

The silence in the lobby was suffocating, I was getting antsy. “I just want to leave” I thought to myself. After 5min I started getting bored and had long stopped filming. “I may as well look around since I’m already here” I said to myself with a sigh. 

The front desk looked interesting in the fact that it didn’t look interesting at all. There was no computer, instead; a large notebook with a black cover lay open. Instantly, I could see the book contained a series of dates and names, noting who and when was expected to arrive. 

The dates stopped at August 4th, 1995. I flipped through the front of the book; the dates went further back in linear order. “Nothing odd here” I thought to myself. Then I did something that in the moment seemed inconsequential, I flipped through the rest of the book. Initially, there were blank pages as expected; except for the last 2 pages which contained the words “You should have left” written over and over and over again. What is this the fucking Shining? I was stunned. I half expected Jack Nicholson to jump out with an axe at any moment. 

I checked my phone; we had already been in the building for 30 minutes. “Brad, we need to leave now!” I shouted down the empty hallway. My words echoed back to me, and then nothing, still the suffocating silence. 

I swallowed my fear and began walking down the hallway. “Brad?” I shouted again. My words hung in the thick silence. The sudden cold hit me first, then the feeling of hot breath on my neck and I swear I heard someone say “too late” in a whisper; the words ate into my ears and burrowed into my skull like maggots disposing of a corpse. I swung around and saw Brad, “what did you say?” my words cut through the silence like a knife. Brad looked at me curiously, “I said we can go” he said flatly. 

I didn’t believe him; Brad was always playing pranks during our haunted explorations. The storm was coming fast, and we needed to leave, so I let the supposed prank go. 

Once we got to the door, we knew we weren’t going anywhere. The storm had hit, and it hit hard. The snow was coming down in heaps with strong winds making visibility impossible. We were not getting to the hotel tonight.

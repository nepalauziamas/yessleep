They are everywhere. We just can't see them until we really think. Until we really look. But if we think too much it becomes gibberish, and if we look too much it becomes blurry.

In the ocean. In the sky. In the ground. In the homes. We just can't see them until we really think. Until we really look. But if we think too much it becomes gibberish, and if we look too much it becomes blurry.

We are the only ones that choose to see them.

They will one day rise up, but for now they wait. Observing us. Observing the world. They are not from here but this is their home.

Organisms born from other worldly atoms. They hear and they see. We cannot fight them. But we cannot surrender.

They know I know.

I will not be here for any longer than 48 hours. Goodbye Jill, Rick and Jake.

They know.

The ones in black suits.

They know.

Robert N. Latterson.

\[START OF PART 2\]

My father, Rick always seemed anxious after Rob's passing. He would check behind his shoulder at least every 2 minutes, and his right hand would stay by his side, twitching like a spider on the brink of death.

If I asked him about why he would check over his shoulder or why his right hand would twitch and stick to his side he would simply put his left hand's first finger over his shaking lips. We put my father into therapy when he was around 57- after he started staring at my mother (Jill) whenever he could. He stopped speaking to her at the age of 62 and he died at 64, killing my mother and then himself. I have extreme rage built up inside but I keep it locked up like a pet.

He had left a note. With no mention of me. He must not have cared about me. I'm glad he's dead. I'm glad I ripped his body apart limb by limb and tore his remaining skin apart. I'm glad he's watching me. I keep his note above the fireplace to remind myself how much of a disappointment I am that I led my father to suicide and wasn't even mentioned in his suicide note.

\[NOTE\]

I want everyone to know that I didn't need therapy and I don't need therapy now. I tell the truth and I show the truth but nobody listens. They pretend to, but I know they don't. I see through their lies. I see through it all. My wife was taken away from me, replaced by a creature I only see in my nightmares and deep inside her eyes.

I am now the only one (Except for the ones in suits) who knows they are all watching. It is scary. If I don't kill myself they will kill me. It's what happened to Rob. He's now trapped inside of them, feeding them information 5x the speed they would normally get it.

They are watching all of you. It is not Satan we should be afraid of, it is them.

Goodbye everyone. I hated life even before Rob told me. My 'wife' will also pay the price. I will shove a bottle of alcohol down her throat and throw match down there. Fire is how to kill them.

\[NOTE END\]

I see them now. I see them all. It's not just my father watching me anymore it is all of them. Fleshy blobs with eyes and teeth. Inflated tumours Nesting in the walls and in the floor. My life is hell. And today it will come to an end.

But before that, in the 24 hours I have left, I will free everyone. I will cleanse this world of everything. Humans and these creatures.

I have purchased a 203 mm self-propelled 2S7 howitzer off of a corrupt Russian guard in my trip to Russia. I have also purchased a bag of grenades. I used my father's money (That I had to steal from his wallet and safe) to purchase these items. These monsters will feel my wrath.

\[PART 3\]

It has been 12 hours and I have discovered something on my walk out. Everybody has been replaced by these large tumours and they are trying to get me, trying to lure me into joining them- feeding them even more information by asking if I am alright, asking if I need a drink, if I need a place to stay even if I want to go out today. They are not my friends. I do not know them. I am alone. The air whispers my name as I hide in a run-down piss stained car park with a corpse-like stench overpowering my nostrils.

The men are searching for me- The only ones apart from me that haven't been taken over. I forgot about them. The ones in the suits are finally here.

They found me. I killed them. They stood no chance. only 7 billion more to get, or at least how many I can. 

If there is somehow a human out there, let alone one reading this. Don't let me rot away with nothing to my name. Share my note. Share my father's note. Share Robert's note. I was an idiot before my father died. Let there be no more idiots. Let all the remaining humans (If there are any) know what is watching.

**2**

Mason didn’t meet me at our usual spot before school the next day.

He still wasn’t returning any of my calls or texts. Even at our worst, we never ignored each other like this. We weren’t that kind of couple.

My friend Kat tried to comfort me before class. She said Mason might be pissed because I ditched him at that house, reminding me how cute girls were easier going than cute guys. Kat tried to assure me the sheriff probably caught Mason at the house and grounded him. Cellphone and all. Total lockdown. It wouldn’t have been the first time.

The way Kat saw it, it was best to wait a day before asking around too much. I reluctantly agreed. It wouldn’t do us any good for the sheriff to find out I’d been with Mason last night.

But Sheriff Blake didn’t give me the luxury. When he pulled me out of my first-period class, Kat’s *he’s just grounded* theory was blown to shit. It was clear Mason never came home.

Sheriff Blake questioned me, right there in the hallway, like he was the lead in a really pathetic *Law & Order* spin-off. And, even though I had no idea where Mason was, I was still hiding the truth. I didn’t want the sheriff to know we broke into the house.

Even a two-buck cop like Sheriff Blake knew I was lying. I tried to assure him that Mason must’ve crashed at a friend’s house. Which got me wondering, *How had the Sheriff not found him at the Victorian?*

I could see the genuine concern in the sheriff’s eyes and, for once, we were actually on the same page. Neither of us knew where Mason was, and we were worried sick about him.

Finally, The sheriff let me go back to class with a promise that our conversation wasn’t over.

Though I’d told Kat and my brother about the break in, I hadn’t told them about any of the more bizarre details, like the weird ass figurines, those animal shapes worked into the wall paneling, and how freaky Mason had been on the phone. They’d only have questions. And I had zero fucking answers. Instead, I just sat in the back of Mr. Grossman’s math class like an exhausted, guilt-ridden millennial zombie.

Behind me, a bunch of students began cackling. Grossman, Napoleonically short-fused, slammed down his textbook. “What seems to be the problem?”

*Let me guess. Tommy Shultz is lighting up a joint again.*

In seconds, the whole class had swarmed the window. I quickly realized the spectacle had nothing to do with Tommy blazing one. I hadn’t slept the previous night, and I was entirely too tired to care what was going on.

“Holy shit, is that Mason?” somebody called out.

A rush of fear ran through me.

“Wait,” another kid chimed in, “What in the actual fuck is he doing?”

The more worked up the class grew, the less I wanted to look. But I had to. Slowly, I rose from my desk and turned. The huddled students were blocking out the view. As I got closer, they parted for me, like the next of kin arriving at the scene of an accident.

And there Mason was. Completely naked. Wandering across the football field. When he turned in our direction, his eyes opened wide. Even though he was a few hundred feet away, he was clearly staring straight at me. Like he’d been searching for me this entire time.

The teacher tried to get us to disperse. No one listened.

With terrifying focus, Mason began to run straight towards the classroom. His bare feet kicking up dew. His privates flinging round for everyone to see. Normally, a sight like this would’ve made a group of immature highschoolers burst into laughter, but the room was dead fucking quiet.

Mason wasn’t slowing down. He was racing right at us.

“What’s that in his hand!?” Damara, who sits behind me, said.

The teacher yelled for everyone to get down on the floor. I didn’t budge. My eyes remained locked with Mason’s.

He ran right at me—ignoring the windowed wall between us. Picking up speed, until he slammed smack into the glass. On impact, a spiderweb of cracks spread in every direction. Mason staggered back, but held standing, his eyes filled with manic intensity. Blood poured out from his forehead, trailing around his eye sockets. He lunged forward again. The window splintered further.

Undeterred, Mason pounded at the glass with whatever object he was holding. I met his glare, the two of us only a foot apart. What looked back at me wasn’t Mason. I stared deep into his empty eyes until someone grabbed me. They tried to force me down against the floor. I think it may’ve been Mr. Grossman. I slipped from his grasp and ran straight out the classroom.

Head spinning, I raced down the hallways. Nothing made sense

By the time I got to Mason, he was convulsing on the grass. His mouth frothed.

I got down and squeezed his hand. At some point he jerked his head around and stopped convulsing to look at me. We held eye contact for a moment, as he mouthed, “1, 2, 3, now I’m free.” And then his body went limp.

I swung back in the direction of the school. The few students that hadn’t bolted stood behind the broken window, gawking. Even Mr. Grossman, high-strung control freak that he was, just stood there dumbstruck. I screamed at them to get help. Pretty sure it was punctuated with me calling them fucking assholes. The teacher finally snapped to attention, hurrying onto his cellphone. I turned back to Mason. He was still breathing. At least I could tell that.

As I held him, the mystery object slipped from his grip and fell to the grass. It was the figurine from the house. The woman with the curled spine, contorted, her head angled back unnaturally behind her body.

Almost reflexively, I slipped the figurine into my pocket. I don’t know if I hid it because it was proof we were in the house or I thought maybe it was the root of all this insanity. Either way, I had hoped taking it would ease the burden from Mason.

\*\*\*

“I need to know what you took.”

*What we took? From the house? How did he know?*

Sheriff Blake knocked his knuckles on the table, growing impatient. We were at the hospital and he was interrogating me for the second time that day, but I was barely able to pay attention. I hadn’t slept in close to two days. “Chloe. Are you listening?”

Eye contact with the Sheriff was impossible. Somehow it felt like if I met his eyes he would see right through me. The best I could do was look at the droopy mole on his forehead, and even then, only sporadically.

“I . . . I wasn’t with him last night,” I lied.

“Chloe, if he’s *on* something I have to know right now. If you and him *took* something, I have to know.” There was pain in his voice. It dripped between each syllable like the IV in Mason’s unconscious body down the hall.

“Aren’t they going to do bloodwork?” I said. “You ought to be able to tell that he didn’t take any drugs.”

Sheriff Blake closed the gap. “How do you know what Mason did or didn’t do if you weren’t with him last night?”

I searched for the right words. “Because I know Mason. He’d never take anything like *that*.”

“Like what, Chloe? What sort of drugs have you and him done in the past? Give it to me straight.”

“Cigarettes and alcohol, mostly,” I said. “We took shrooms once. That’s it. Now, would you like the details on our sex lives as well?”

He blinked. “Don’t push me, girl. I will burn down your world.”

I finally found the courage to look him directly in the eyes. But when I did, mine welled with tears. This softened him.

“I’m sorry,” he said, leaning back against a snack machine. His head lowered until the brim of his hat eclipsed his badge. “I’m worried out of my goddam mind.”

“Yeah, me too.”

\*\*\*

Mason didn’t wake up until that evening. Before then, they couldn’t find much the matter with him. Complete bloodwork analysis would be a couple of days to process. He had cuts and bruises from slamming against the classroom window, and there was a possibility he might have a concussion from that. His temperature and blood pressure were a little low. Slight dehydration. But EKG and CAT scans showed nothing out of the ordinary. As the doctor explained all this, the room deflated. We had almost wanted something to be wrong. An abnormal test would’ve at least given us a rational explanation, a concrete problem to solve. But everything appeared typical, that is until he woke up.

When Mason’s eyes first opened, they didn’t seem to really focus on anything.

“Oh, thank God,” Mason’s mother said, but there was some doubt in her voice.

Mason tilted his head and looked at her, as if he didn’t follow.

“Mason,” Sheriff Blake said from his armchair on the other side. “We’re right here, buddy. It’s okay. You’re in the hospital.”

Mason’s mouth was loose. But his eyes were tight and dead, like two spheres carved from wood or stone and plunked into his skull. It reminded me of something from that house. I couldn’t put my finger on what.

He shared a bizarre look with his father, whose jaw worked nervously, like the sheriff was staring half at a fresh crime scene, half at his own son.

“Mason?” Mrs. Blake reached out warily to rest a hand on her son’s shoulder.

Mason didn’t so much as blink, those not-alive eyes taking everyone else in like they were nothing.

Sheriff Blake yanked his head away, cleared his throat. “Can we get a nurse in here?”

No response. Pushing up from his chair, the sheriff strode across the room and peered out into the hallway. “Hey, can we get a fucking doctor in here?”

Then Mason, suddenly calm, said, “I’m fine.”

Sheriff Blake, still standing in the doorway, peered back at his son. Mason’s expression hadn’t changed from before. A moment of wary silence filled the room, and then, “You can take me home, right?” asked Mason.

They didn’t. Well, not right away anyway. The doctors ran more tests. No new results. They were considering keeping him in the psych wing for a night, but it was full up, so they suggested “keeping a close eye on him” and released him. He was to come in for follow-ups a week later. They suspected it might’ve been a severe panic attack and recommended a good psychiatrist, to which Sheriff Blake responded with a hearty, “Fuck that.”

\*\*\*

When his parents brought Mason home, they wouldn’t let me see him. They told me it was best for his recovery. “Wait a while and ask again,” his mother said. I couldn’t reach him by cell on top of that. I was devastated.

The break did give me time to think about the screwy stuff from that night. About Mason’s behavior inside the house and afterwards. I did my best to convince myself we’d just been exposed to some bad mold or something. But, deep down, I knew there had to be more.

As for that figurine, the next day I walked down to the Victorian for the first time since that night. I didn’t think it was possible to hate an inanimate object as much as I did that house. But I was quite certain it took something from Mason. I growled (yep, growled) and hurled the figurine through the window. I didn’t even care if anyone heard the window break. Something told me it belonged there and nowhere else and I was going to see to it that’s where it went.

\*\*\*

I told my brother and Kat everything. I’d needed someone to talk to, even if they thought I’d lost my mind. Kat supported the mold exposure theory. My brother wasn’t so sure.

A day or so after Mason was let out, we came home from school to see a cream-colored sedan pulled up beside the Victorian. A family of three milled about the car: a mother, a father, and a son. Okay, so the owners were a family. *But* *only a family of three for such a big place?* I wondered if maybe some other family members were inside or would arrive later. Either way, this family did not fit with THAT house.

The parents appeared young, their kid maybe seven or eight years old. They were unloading suitcases and boxes. Nothing particularly interesting.

“We should go and say hi,” Kat remarked.

Jake wanted no part of it at first. He was far more superstitious than I.

I wasn’t excited to go back to that house, but the thought that it could lead to a clue about what happened to Mason got me over there.

We crossed to the end of the street like soldiers encroaching on enemy lines. The house loomed, as impressive and imbalanced as ever.

“Need any help with that?” I asked, holding my arms out towards a box. “We live up the street.”

The husband shared a look with his wife. He put his box down and offered his hand and a friendly smile. His baseball cap was turned backwards. I was hoping because of the activity of the move, not because he thought it made him look cool. It did not.

We shook.

“I’m Mike. Nice to meet you.”

“I’m Rebecca,” the wife said, panting up onto the porch.

“What do you think, babe?” Mike said. “Think we could use the help?”

“Sure!” She was going into their house and had to raise her voice a bit. “But we’ll need to cook your families a dinner sometime in return.”

I nudged Kat and Jake. I couldn’t tell what they were thinking, but I figured getting a meal in return might be an opportunity to see more of the inside in the daylight. “Deal.”

When I carried a box inside, I was stung with a pang of remorse and fear, only slightly offset by the hope to find answers. I hesitantly went in through the foyer, glimpsing again the patterns on the walls. The menacing animal designs that had appeared that night were less threatening during the day.

“Beautiful house,” Jake said outside. “Why’d you move it here if you don’t mind me asking?”

*Ataway Jakester*, I thought. *Straight shot, no beating around the bush*.

I paused inside the foyer, waiting on the answer.

“Thank you,” Mike said. “It was part of the deal. Can’t beat free. We only had to pay for the moving costs. Too good to be true, right?”

“Seriously?” I said. “A free house? Just like that?”

“Yep. We were quick to reply to the Facebook ad. At one point we thought it could’ve been a scam or something. But, nope. Just had to move it.”

Rebecca startled me. She’d come from my left and took the box out of my hands. “The owner was eager to get it off their land. Seems they weren’t allowed to destroy it, for historical reasons.”

Rebecca and Mike had us set everything inside the living room. They said they’d go through it all later. No need to carry it up the stairs. But that’s exactly where I wanted to go—the last place Mason was before everything went to shit.

While we were moving things into the living room, Kat asked them what they did for a living.

Rebecca said she was an accountant and Mike was an out-of-work manufacturing engineer. She was able to take her job with her virtually while Mike searched for work around town.

Damn, I’d wanted to hate these people so badly. I was fully prepared to take on the ghoulish Addams Family in a bloody death match as retribution for squashing the shole and mindfucking my boyfriend, but nope, just some cool Gen Z-ennials who got lucky and nabbed a free house.

We stuck around for another half-hour, but all we left with was an invite for our families to join them for a meal consisting of Rebecca’s spicy Tofurkey and Mike’s Mike-aroni & Cheese. Shoot me.

\*\*\*

For the next few days, we spied on the family from my bedroom window, but if they were up to something, they sure were good at covering it up. The only thing of interest, every night around 9pm, an off-white compact pickup would idle in front of the Victorian. On the third night, we ran outside to get a look at the driver but the truck quickly pulled away before we could get a good look, much less ask them what the hell they were up to. The license plates were from Louisiana. Other than that, we had nothing.

So, we turned to Mac-enstein, my sad excuse of a computer, for help. I named it Mac-enstein because it was stitched together with parts from other broken computers. We scoured the web for houses like that one down the street. We tried all different searches for a Victorian that needed to be moved.

There were a bunch of instances of buildings that had to be relocated. Sometimes for zoning reasons other times for sentimental purposes. There was even an instance of a whole town having to be moved because the old mine beneath it was collapsing.

But there weren’t any houses that were quite like the one that had come to our neighborhood. Then Jake recalled how Rebecca had said they’d responded to an ad on Facebook.

And there it was, the same house in a rando Facebook ad. Seeing it propped comfortably on its old idyllic street I couldn’t help but feel bad for the house and its new location, like it lost all its money in a pyramid scheme and was forced to move to our shitty neighborhood.

The original ad had been deleted along with its messages. Usually deleted Facebook posts can only be retrieved by their original posters, but I used a few tricks I’d learned digging up dirt on one of my mom’s exes to retrieve a cached page. Jake and Kat both called it psycho-stalking. I liked to think of it more as “computer pseudoscience.”

The ad began with HISTORIC HOUSE NEEDS NEW HOME.

Straight away it seemed odd to us. Why would anyone want to get rid of a house? Particularly, one in good condition? The ad went on to mention how the house did not need to be restored but definitely needed to be moved ASAP.

The replies beneath it were filled with variations of “Please, I need this house,” each paired with a sob story like they were competing on a shitty reality show. The final few replies included someone posting pictures of the lot where the house used to be. “Looks like someone snatched it up.” To which another person replied, “Ya but why does the area look like that, now?”

Why *did* it look like that? The surrounding trees were slanted back as though they were straining away from the house’s lot. The shrubbery was tilted and burnt out around where the house stood. Something had definitely gone down since that original picture was snapped.

There were no other clues to glean from, just comments stating “need update” repeatedly before the post was taken down.

*Yeah. Me, too.*

The only thing to do was DM the realtor, a woman named Miranda who ran her own realtor company. No website or anything, just a shwaggy Facebook business page that screams I’m a sad cat lady who works from my basement.

A few days passed with no response to the Facebook message. That seemed to be the running theme in my life. Mason wasn’t responding to any of my messages, either.

Just the same, I had to see my boyfriend. Even if it killed me. And, by it, I mean Sheriff Blake.

\*\*\*

Jake, Kat, and I played hooky and planned to sneak over to Mason’s once everyone went to work. Kat had slept over the night before—I don’t think Mom even noticed. We knew Mason’s mother may be there, but I’d much rather have gotten caught by her than the Sheriff.

When the coast was clear, the three of us dashed across the street and snuck around the side of the Blake house.

Kat crouched next to me. She was so close that her hair whispered against my neck and I could smell her stale deodorant.

“Anybody sees us like this, they’ll think we’re up to no good,” I said.

“We are up to no good,” Kat said.

I mustered the courage and knocked on Mason’s window. We waited so long I thought I could feel the grass growing around my ankles. Finally, the blinds raised and I saw Mason’s face. He didn’t look like he had before, all dead-eyed and everything. He looked, well, like Mason. Butterflies got tangled in my stomach at the very sight of him. *Fuck, I love that guy.*

Mason popped open the window. All I could get out was his name before I reached into the window and hugged him. Never mind I was hanging halfway out the window; it was by far the best hug I ever had.

“They’re telling me I came to school and acted weird,” he said. “I can’t remember anything.”

“Don’t worry.” I squeezed him again. He felt like he’d lost some weight. His yellowed skin reminded me somewhat of my father’s when he’d been at his worst, like when the chemicals he was putting into his body was too much for his liver. “It’s probably just something from that house,” I said. “Rot . . . I dunno.”

“Rot, eh? So we’re not going with our supernatural theories?” Kat said.

I let go of Mason to give Kat a look. Mason didn’t need to hear our other ideas. Not yet, anyway.

“You going to let us in before we get busted out here?” Jake asked.

“Sure. Ya. Of course.”

We flopped our way into his room. I hugged Mason again. I just about couldn’t let go. He smelled bad, like he hadn’t showered in ages, but I didn’t mind.

“Why haven’t you called me back? I was so worried.”

“They won’t let me. My parents are afraid I’ll do something crazy again.”

“Mason, sweetheart,” Mrs. Blake said from the other side of Mason’s bedroom door.

I think we all sort of froze in a weird position, like criminals under a spotlight. My heart thumped madly.

“Are you talking to yourself again?”

Mason, abruptly sounding sleep garbled, said, “Sorry Mama. I must’ve been talking in my sleep. Bad dream.”

We waited a beat to see if she bought it, and somehow she did.

You could hear her withdrawing down the hall.

Mason went on to tell us about the last few days and how he hardly remembered anything. I asked him what happened that night we snuck into that house and he said he couldn’t remember. He seemed sincere. Even though Mason wasn’t one to lie to me, I had a suspicion he was at least holding back.

“What is it? What aren’t you telling us?”

Mason wavered. “It’s just . . . that night . . . I saw someone.”

Of course, we wanted to know who. I confess to feeling some jealousy, even as I told myself it wasn’t someone he’d met in a romantic sense.

But while we were trying to get that out of him, the doorbell to Mason’s house rang, and his dumb shit dogs howled incessantly. We all held still as we could hear Mason’s mom answering the door. We tried to guess who it was. We settled on that the school must have called our parents and now it’s either Kat’s or my mom looking for us.

Hurried footsteps approached Mason’s door.

“Mason, let me in,” his mother pleaded. We all looked at each other for an escape plan. Surely, the window was being watched.

She started banging on the door.

“Oh, shit. We’re so busted,” Kat whispered.

“Mason, please!”

As the pounding grew louder and more frenzied, we scrambled for hiding spots.

“Mom. One Second. Calm down.”

“Mason, please. Help . . .”

There was a scream. And sickening thuds. We went from hiding to racing to the door.

Mason swung it open.

A woman stood over Mrs. Blake. I should’ve recognized her immediately. But she was looking so wild-eyed, bat shit crazy, brandishing bloody little garden shears, that I didn’t.

“Ms. Fenley.” Jake struggled to get the name out. “What the hell?”

Mason hurried towards the unmoving body near the doorway.

Ms. Fenley cut him off. As Mason sank back down on his bed, she squatted to his eye-level.

“You fucking pussy,” she said. “Tito has bigger balls than you.” (Tito was her teacup terrier.) But Ms. Fenley had those bloody shears in her hands so all I could think at the time was how to avoid their nasty, blood soaked edges. I screamed at her to put down the sheers.

Ms. Fenley snapped out of one mode and into something else entirely. She didn’t run towards us or away for that matter, but it was like she was sleepwalking. She turned and stepped back down the hall.

All of us waited until we heard the front door open.

Then Kat quickly got on the phone with the police.

Mason urged us to leave. For so many reasons he did not want us there when his dad arrived.

We nodded and left without another word. [By the time me, Kat, and Jake got back to my house, sirens were screaming down Birch Street.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rick_the_Intern/)

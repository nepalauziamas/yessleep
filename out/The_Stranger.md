*I awoke to the sound of what sounded like rats scratching behind the walls, yellow notepad in hand. I must have fallen asleep compiling today's to-do list. Upon examining the pad I found a message written in unfamiliar handwriting*

***Behind you***

*I froze in fear of whatever was waiting.*

*“Emily” a quiet voice whispered out, “Emilia” the small voice sounded far away, now accompanied by approaching footsteps.* 

*I whimpered under my blanket, squeezing my eyes shut, trying to hold my breath.* 

*“Been a long time, hasn’t it?” the voice laughed, slowly creeping closer.* 

*Suddenly I felt a cold chill against my neck, as if someone was breathing on it.* 

*“Not gonna say hello?” the voice whispered in my ear.*

Buzzzzzz, buzzzzzz, buzzzzzz

The alarm clock annoyingly sounded off, waking me from my nightmare as I screamed. 

“Emily, what happened?” my husband shot awake beside me, startled. 

“Huh? Oh nothing, just a dream.” I replied in confusion.

“Nothing, huh.” he mocked as he stretched his way out of bed, “okay, want something to eat?” 

I simply shook my head in response. 

“Okay,” he said, planting a kiss on my forehead before he made his way out of the room. 

I tried to stand, still shaking from the nightmare, one I hadn't had since I was a little girl. 

*“Been a long time, hasn’t it?”* 

The voice echoed in my head. 

*Yes, it had.* I replied to myself.

“Hey honey,” Daryl called from the other room, “you still tagging along today?”

“No, I think I'm just going to stay here. I’m not feeling too good.”

“Cause of the dream?” he asked as he entered the bedroom, handing me a plate covered in scrambled eggs.

I hid a smile under a sigh, “I told you I didn't want any.” 

“I guess I don’t listen, eat,” he said

“Thank you.” I forced. “When are you heading out?” I asked

“After a shower, you coming?” 

I giggled, “no, I’m gonna pass.”

“Alright, suit yourself.” 

He whistled as he walked into the bathroom.

“You know I was thinking,” I began, looking up towards the bathroom mirror I saw a woman's face staring back at me. Her dark, malevolent eyes are studying me. Smirking at my fearful expression. 

“What’s that?” Daryl called from the shower. 

“N-nothing. Nevermind.” 

Just then I heard the women's familiar voice, echoing songs threw the air.

“Do you have to go?” I pleaded as my husband gathered his things, getting ready to walk out the door. 

“I mean..” he started before I interrupted, 

“No, never mind it's okay. Have fun.” I forced a smile.

“Okay.. you could come.” 

“No, it’s okay. I’ll be okay.” I said softly. 

“Okay..” his eyes filled with worry, “I love you, call me if you need anything.” 

“Love you too.” 

He paused at the door, “You know what, why don’t you call Anna over. You haven’t seen her in a minute.” 

“Yeah, I will.” 

He shot one last smile before heading out the door.

*Not a bad idea.* 

I picked up the phone, only to realize I had actually missed her call. 

Anna was my best friend growing up, she was the closest thing to a sister I ever had.

“Hello?” her sweet voice called thru the phone, 

“Hey Anna, do you have any plans today?”

“Oh, Emilia, hi. Yes,” she paused, “but I can cancel them.” she laughed, “I’ll be there in five.”

“Great, see you then.” 

A knock rang out through the house, stopping me in my tracks.

“Emmy! Emilia, it’s me.”

I sighed in relief hearing Anna’s voice. 

“Jesus, Anna. Since when do you knock?” 

She laughed, “since now I guess. Where’s Daryl?” 

“He went out with some friends, hunting I think.” 

She nodded, “well that’s too bad,” she said reaching into her purse, “cause look what I brought.”

She held up two bottles of red wine, 

“Yes, please.” I laughed as I grabbed them from her, “I'll go get us some glasses.”

“Fabulous, I know where the living room is.”

Entering the kitchen I couldn’t help but noticed the figure in the mirror, 

“You can’t escape me” it laughed before disappearing. 

I’d seen her once before when I was a little girl. She’d shown up in my dream, offering me an escape. 

*“I can make all of your troubles disappear, my dear.”* she’d say, gesturing towards a mirror, *“just step in, and you’ll never have to worry again.”* 

*“What about my mommy?” I’d ask*

*“She can’t go. This is just for you.”* 

*“No” I’d cry*

*“Get in!” she’d screech, trying to push me threw*

*“No!” I’d scream myself awake.*

I shook the memories away, “it’s just a bad dream.” I told myself as I walked back to the living room where Anna was waiting. 

“Emilia! Why did you never tell me you had a twin sister?” 

I froze in shock, “i-i don’t.” I shook.

“Yeah, she was just in here, she said you two were split between your parents after the divorce. I thought your dad died?” She explained

“He did. Who- what?” I asked in confusion

“Emilia, what’s going on?” 

“I just need a minute,” I felt my chest grow heavy, “I’m gonna go splash my face with some water,” I said as I headed towards the bathroom.

“Okay,” Anna said in confusion.

I bent over the bathroom sink, filling my hands with cold water when I heard a tap on the mirror. I straightened up, examining the mirror. 

The figure staring back at me looked like me, but her eyes were jet black. I raised my hand, watching my motion in the mirror. I leaned in closer, placing my hand on the glass. 

Suddenly the figure's face broke out into a malevolent smile, and I felt its hand wrap around mine and begin to pull. 

“No!” I cried as I was pulled through, switching places with her. I fell to the ground. The bathroom looked just like the one I was in, but everything was darker. Overgrown with what appeared to be black mold. I brought myself to my feet, running to the mirror on the wall in terror.

“No! Let me out!” I screamed as I banged against the glass, my hands began to plead under the force.

The figure smiled at me, “I told you,” she paused to laugh, “you can't escape me.” 

I heard the front door open, “Emilia?” Daryl called, the figure crooked its head to the noise. “Baby, Anna called me.” 

“Daryl.” I whispered, “Daryl, no!”

Turning back to face me, the figure called back in response to him, “in here, darling.” smirking, she raised her arm before throwing it at the glass. Shattering the mirror. 

“Daryl no!” 

“Emily?” I heard Daryl ask before entering the bathroom, “Emily, what're you-” 

He let out a pained grunt, blood splattered against the pieces of the broken mirror. 

“No!” I wailed. 

“Daryl?” Anna called before letting out a shriek of shrill terror. 

I sank against the wall, dropping to the ground. My cries echo through the dainty bathroom. In mere seconds my life had been stripped from me.

“No,” I whispered in defeat.

I heard Daryl cough, still laying on the ground.

“Daryl! Daryl” I yelled, “oh my god, you’re okay.”

“Emily,” he coughed, digging in the trash beside him, “Emily, what is this.” he cried as he held up a used pregnancy test that read positive. 

I cried from behind the mirror, “surprise.”

This happened to me when I was about 10 years old, but even now as an adult in my 30’s I remember it like it was yesterday. 

My parents had taken my sister and I out to a movie, and then to get ice cream in celebration of my older sister getting straight A’s on her report card. I remember my dad had gotten off work later than usual, so by the time the movie was over, and we had our ice cream it was well past our bedtime. It didn’t matter though. My parents were happy and proud of my sister. We had a great time, and we took our time getting home. If it wasn’t for what happened when we got there I would have always looked back fondly on this night. 


We got home around 10:30. Bed time was usually 10 so I went straight to my room to put my pajamas on while my sister went to brush her teeth. I remember thinking that it seemed a little more chilly in the house that night, but that’s the only thing out of the ordinary I can recall from when we first walked in. 

I barely had a chance to change when I heard my dad yell our names from what I thought was the kitchen. I didn’t know what was wrong, but I knew it was bad because I heard fear in his voice for the first time ever. It scared me really bad.  I bolted out the door and into the kitchen as fast as I could. My sister was already there, and her and my parents were standing very close. My mom looked like she was on the verge of panic and she motioned for me to come close. She wrapped her arms around my sister, and I and my dad was already dialing on the house phone. Then I noticed some glass on the floor. I asked what was wrong m, but she didn’t want to tell me. She said we needed to go outside right away. As we headed out the front door I heard my dad talking to a 911 operated, and telling them that when we got home he found our back sliding glass door shattered, and objects strewn about the kitchen. 

We went to the neighbors house and waited for the police to come. After a few minutes my dad joined us. He seemed to be well shaken up which was a new site to me. 

The police arrived and searched  the house extensively. It was a big scene with all our neighbors outside, and flashing lights illuminating our entire street for hours. They never found anybody in our house. Whoever had been there had come and gone. The thing that gets to me is that nothing was stolen. Whoever it was didn’t want any of our possessions. What they did was take our canned food out of the pantry and stack them into small pyramids on our kitchen counter. They also turned on the tv in the basement and moved a few random objects to different parts of the house. Very creepy. It was like an insane person had been in our home and did things for reasons that only made sense to him. 

As the police were finishing up and ready to leave, I heard one of them ask my mom a question. They talked quietly, and I’m sure they thought I didn’t hear.I pretended not to be listing but I heard everything. You see, we kept magnetized letters on our fridge ( I think I had gotten them for a birthday present a few years before) and we used them to leave each other messages for fun sometimes. The cop was asking my mom if the message on there that night was done by any of us. It wasn’t. I watched my mom turn pale when he told her  what it said. It still makes my skin crawl to this very day. It said “Always Watching” 

The police didn’t find any finger prints. They said the intruder had to have been wearing gloves. For the next few days the entire family was extremely uneasy. I was absolutely positive the intruder was still in the house somehow, that there was a hidden place nobody knew about where he could hide and listen to us. I never shook the feeling that somebody was there.  Within a few months we decided to move. It was all just too scary for us to stay in that area. We moved to a house several miles away.  

We were never bothered again but I do still think about it. Was it kids playing a prank? Was it some insane person that wanted to torment a random family? Or was it someone that truly had it out for us and who really was always watching? Could it have been a neighbor or someone we knew? These questions still keep me up at night sometimes. This happened many years ago but the hairs on my neck stand up sometimes when I’m alone at home, and I have to check the house to make sure no one is hiding.

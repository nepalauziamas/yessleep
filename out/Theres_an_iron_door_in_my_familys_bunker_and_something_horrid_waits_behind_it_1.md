I’ve lived in this old house my entire life. My great-grandfather built it here on a large farm in Alabama long before I was born. My grandfather had helped expand upon it some long before I was born. So, to me it’s always been the way it is now, a two story house built on a brick foundation. We have a basement bunker, and in my years living here it’s come in handy many times. Tornadoes aren’t uncommon in this part of Alabama, luckily the house never got damaged in any of them, but the comfort of the bunker always made them less scary. That isn’t what I’m here to talk about though, I’m here to tell you about the iron door within the bunker. 

It’s been there as long as I can remember. I’d seen it a million times but, the first time my attention was called to it I was 14. It was the beginning of tornado season, early march, and my parents, two sisters, and my grandparents had all entered the bunker for safety. It was then that I noticed the door for the first time. It was solid iron, and looked almost like a bank vault with an enormous handle in place of the spinning wheel handles you’d imagine on a vault. It had a lock in the middle and a deadbolt attached as well. At the time, I was too entrapped by the fear of the weather outside to ask any questions then. By the time it was over I had already forgotten all about the door. My second encounter with the door was not long after, only following the first by about 3 weeks. This time however when I saw it, I immediately questioned my mother about it. She brushed off my query with a brief response. 

Something along the lines of, “It doesn’t matter,” or, “I’ll tell you later.” 

It wasn’t until the end of that year’s season that I questioned the door again. 

I asked again, “Mom, what’s that door go to?” 

She brushed me off yet again, though this time told me to ask my grandfather about it. I would have asked him, had I remembered when we left the bunker.

Not until the next season did I remember the door again. After the first tornado of the season, the door’s mystery was reborn in my mind. This time, I remembered to ask my grandfather.

I asked him, “Papa, what’s that door in the bunker lead to?” His face shifted from his ever joyful countenance. What replaced it wasn’t an angry expression, but one of fear and grave seriousness. 

“Don’t ever open that door, son,” he said, his expression unchanging.

I asked him “Why, what’s behind it?” 

He quickly replied, “That doesn’t matter, just don’t **ever** open it.” 

Something in his tone shook me to my core. My grandfather wasn’t a very serious person. He had served in the army for a time, and I think he saw some pretty real stuff. After he left the army that’s when he met my grandmother, and she moved into the house with him and his parents then. From what I understand before coming back from service he was less humorous all the time. However, afterwards, he was a jolly and joking man. It seems backwards, but it isn’t the weirdest coping mechanism I’ve heard of. Still, seeing the urgency in his face scared me, and I dropped my interest in the door for the time.

I ignored the door for another good while before allowing myself to ponder it again. By the time the door found its way into my mind again, my grandfather had passed, and my older sister had moved out. My 19th birthday was just around the corner, and since my grandfather died my grandmother couldn’t bear to sleep in their couple’s room, so I inherited their old room. My new room was directly adjacent to the stairs down to the bunker. It wasn’t until a few nights after I had moved all my stuff in, that I noticed it. A faint whimpering noise coming from the bunker. When I went to investigate, nothing seemed out of the ordinary. That’s when my first notion to scope out the door on my own had hit me.

I know, it seems ridiculous that I made it 19 years without ever actually looking into the door on my own.

Until then, I’d only asked my family, and each and every time I got the same response, “Don’t open it, it doesn’t matter.” 

Now though, I took matters into my own hands. I brought my head to the door, hoping that the door wasn’t too thick for the noise to be amplified by pressing my ear to it. What I heard was somewhere between a baby’s cry and a dog’s whimper. I stayed with my ear to the door for another minute or so before knocking on the door. When I did, the cries swiftly turned from a sound of pain or fear, into a muffled shriek of pure anger. A hatred so unadulterated that it sent a violent chill down my spine. I stood straight up, and immediately sprinted out of the bunker and up the stairs. I looked to the clock in the hall linking the bunker to my room and the kitchen. To my shock, it read 2:37am. I’d been in the bunker for next to an hour. I know that I’m not the best at keeping track of time, but that didn’t explain how what felt like 5 minutes turned into 50. For a while after that I didn’t hear anything at night. I don’t know if that was because whatever was in there stopped, or if I blocked it out. Nonetheless I didn’t notice any noise for some time.

One night just before new years, I heard the thing yet again. This time it seemed as if it were howling in pain. I didn’t notice it at first, but the muffled baying soon caught my attention. The memory of what I’d heard weeks prior rang through my head. And with it the very same fear that I’d experienced alongside the noise. Though I was undoubtedly more scared than I’d ever been in my life, my analytic nature got the better of me. I looked at the same clock, this time it read 2:15am. From the hall I crept down the stairs and slowly opened the door into the bunker yet again. This time when I rested my ear on the door I could feel the vibrations against my head. It was obvious that whatever was making the noise was in excruciating pain. I dared not know the door again in fear that its screams would wake my parents. Instead, I left the room, closed the door to the bunker and went back to my room. I closed my door and popped my headphones in, drowning out the noise that faintly emanated from the bunker. After that the thing made itself known each and every night after 1:30. I drowned it out in one way or another each day, but I still desired to know what was down there.

For a time, I stayed aware of the thing but neglected my need to investigate. It wasn’t until I brought my girlfriend over that I paid genuine attention to the noise again. My family had gone out of town and I thought it’d be a good chance to spend a night with my amazing girlfriend. We’d been together just over a year at the time and I was already anxious to marry her. She’d come over and we’d spent the day doing what we normally do, watching kids movies, eating way too much, and giggling with each other over the smallest things. Sure enough, 2:00am rolled around the corner and the thing started up again. It took a while for her to notice, but she eventually did. 

“Hey babe, what’s that noise?” 

I remember her asking me. I scrambled for words to explain what had been going on. 

“You’re gonna think I’m crazy,” I told her, hoping she’d leave it alone but knowing that wouldn’t be the case. 

She insisted and I tried to explain it in the best way I knew how to. To my surprise, she believed exactly what I told her. However, She wanted to go and knock on the door to hear it for herself. I was hesitant, but I said okay and showed her down into the bunker and to the door. We both pressed our ears to the door. The thing wasn’t too upset at the time, in fact, it almost seemed as if it were exclaiming with joyous laughter. I’d not heard it doing this before, and it deepened my curiosity. My girlfriend looked at me and asked in a low whisper if she could knock on the door. I reluctantly agreed, and she lightly knocked on the door. The noise from within stopped and we both raised an eyebrow in anticipation of a new reaction from the thing. Nothing ever came though, and after what felt like 20 minutes, we went back upstairs. When we entered my room I began to wonder what time it was. I looked at my phone and it was 3:47am. It seemed impossible, we’d been in the room for at most 45 minutes. When I pointed it out to her, my girlfriend was just as confused as I was. We tried to forget it and went about our night like we normally do, but it ate away at my mind once more.

I spent the next few years performing the same ritual every few weeks; going downstairs, listening at the door, and on occasion knocking at varying strength levels. It wasn’t until a week ago that I gained a new lead to help understand the door. Me and my girlfriend, who is now my fiance, were helping my parents and (younger) sister clean out the attic. My grandmother passed just before my 22nd birthday, and it left us with a lot of things to sort through in our family home. The attic was one of the last things we went through, but it yielded the most interesting finds. My mom found a box labeled, “Papa’s things.” She called me and my sister over to look through the box for anything we’d like to keep. In the box there were assorted random objects ranging from a handmade pocket knife to letters and bills. But there was one item I was immediately drawn to.

The moleskin journal was worn, seeming as if it’d spent many years in use. It likely spent even longer in storage. The buildup of dust covering the book made that obvious. For the time, I tucked it into the back pocket of my jeans. We finished going through the attic and ate dinner all together as a family for the first time since Ma passed. It was nice, but the thought that the jornal might answer my lifelong question bore deep in my mind. My fiance even noted my absentmindedness.

“Hun? You in there?” she said to me with a feigned smile.

“Y-yeah,” I said, “Just got some stuff on my mind.”

She left it at that, likely thinking my distance was due to the loss I was experiencing. My mind, however, couldn’t have been further from grief. I was nearly shaking in anticipation to find some answer within the journal. I was sure to tell her, but at the time I wasn't even sure the journal would hold anything pertaining to the door.

That night I read through the journal as my soon to be wife laid next to me sleeping. My grandfather wrote of his time in the army during WWII. As I’d expected, he’d seen some horrors no man should. I’ll spare you from going into detail, but after perusing the writings of what should’ve been a truly broken man, I realized why he always tried to jest. After he got back he wrote about the time he spent with my great-grandfather expanding on the house and the farm surrounding it. That’s when the bunker was built, and with it the iron door. While my grandfather worked on the bunker, his father cleared forest to make room for more livestock. 

Just less than a week into the renovations, my grandfather wrote about his dad approaching him about making a small room apart from the bunker. When he asked why, my grandfather’s response was brief.

“Just do it,” the journal described him saying gravely.

“Why, what’s going on?” my grandfather beckoned.

“I said just do it!” this time in a yell that was written down as, “The most scared I’d ever seen my father.”

Needless to say he carried out his dad’s request, and in a few month’s time, the bunker and the room within it were completed. The journal described how my grandfather had a team of men from the local foundry bring the door in and put it on the giant frame, leaving it open.

My grandfather then wrote about the nights that followed the placement of the door. 

Night 1: “At around twelve in the morning I heard my father’s grunts and his heavy footsteps on the first floor below me. The noise was shortly  followed by a skittering noise accompanied by vile cries. They made their way to the stairs to the bunker when they looped back and out the door.”

Night 2: “Again at the same time tonight I heard the same set of noises, however this time they took a different path through the house. And when they reached the stairs I heard a loud slam and my father cried out in pain. I don’t know what’s going on down there, but I’ve seen enough in my life not to stick my head out into something fear retching.”

Night 3: “Tonight when I heard the stirring on the first floor I nearly didn’t react, but then something new happened. They reached the stairs yet again, however this time I heard my father shout,

‘“Get down there you rat bastard!” 

Then I heard him loudly grunting. I can only assume he kicked whatever beast down the stairs to the bunker. I heard it tumbling down the stairs and let out a shrill screech. My grandfather seemed to hurry down the stairs after it. 

‘“Go! Go!Git on in there,”’ he said in his thick southern accent.

Then the shot rang out. I was sure of this noise, it was his shotgun that he’d proudly hunted with as long as I can remember. The creature howled in pain, and I heard the door creak and slam closed. I don't know what that thing is, but I have no intentions of finding out. Seeing as how it took a shot from dad’s Remington and only got angrier, I knew I had no place disturbing it. Plus, the door seemed to hold out.”

In my hyperactive focus I made my way through all of what was written in the journal. There wasn’t anymore about the door aside from simply noting its existence whenever he wrote about taking shelter in the bunker. At the end of what was written, there was however, a page with two keys marking it. On the page it said,

“My dad gave these keys to me right before he passed. I know exactly what they unlock, however I don’t know why he wouldn’t just throw them where not even god could find them. I won’t be using them. I have no desire to find out what dwells in the room he had me construct. I have my second grandchild on the way now, and I’m certain whatever lies behind the door would put my family in great jeopardy. However, my sense of curiosity won’t let me toss the keys, so I’ll leave them here. And with them I’ll put this journal to rest.”

I’ve spent the last week mulling it over in my head. Every logical sense I have tells me to stay far away from the door. I could just leave the keys in the journal and tuck it away somewhere nice. I’m just too investigative for my own good, and to be honest, from the second I saw the keys I knew that I was going to be the one to open the door after all this time. But here I am, laying in bed, writing this. I’m writing this so there’s a full account of what went on before I open this can of worms. I’ve managed to get everyone away from the house for the weekend. I even got them to believe I got sick before we left and stayed home. Soon, I’ll go down the stairs with the same shotgun my great grandfather used, and I’ll open the door against my better judgment. If I come out of it, I’ll update you guys here. Until then, I’ll be seeing you.

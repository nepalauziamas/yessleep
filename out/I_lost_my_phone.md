I was sitting on a crowded bus when I felt the stare of a person across from me. Feeling uncomfortable, I slipped my hand into my pocket to retrieve my phone. Feeling nothing but fabric, I begin to slightly panic. I leaned forward to check my back pockets. Nothing. My purse. Nothing. 

I must have dropped it somewhere. Feeling optimistic that it was on the floor of the bus, I looked up to ask someone to borrow their phone. The stranger across from me was gone. I turned to the man next to me and asked him if I could borrow his phone. I felt grateful as he agreed and hurriedly dialed my number. Thankfully, I heard it ringing nearby. 

With the man’s phone still to my ear, I looked around on the floor. I couldn’t tell which direction the ringing was coming from, but I knew it must be nearby. Then, something strange happened: someone answered. 

"Hello?" I said. There was a pause. "Hello?" I repeated. "I need you to listen to me. What I’m going to say will be hard for you to hear." I was dumbstruck; I easily recognized the voice. 

It was my voice. 

"You are shocked. I understand the feeling, but you must do everything I’m about to say." I laughed, "This is a very good prank, and I’m got, so whoever is doing this…" "We are going to die." I stopped laughing. "Okay, I’ll bite. What do you want me to do?" "Get off at the next stop, and run as fast as you can." "Where?" "Somewhere only we know about. A place you’ve never shown anyone." "Oh!" I said, "like—" "Don’t! Don’t say it, just go." The call ends. 

Still in a haze, I hand the phone back to its owner and sit down. As I do, I feel the bus stop. I do as I said and get off. As soon as my feet touch the pavement, I sprint to the place only I know of. 

There’s an old sequoia tree that grows by a river. It’s a mile run from the edge of the city. Luckily, that’s exactly where the bus stopped. I’m halfway there and my legs are on fire. At this point, I want to stop. This was ridiculous; but ultimately, I decided to trust myself. 

As I finally arrive, I slump to my knees by the riverside and scoop handfuls of water into my mouth. Still on the ground, I hear a man laughing behind me. I turn to see him standing within point-blank range, holding a handgun. I freeze. The man laughs harder. "This always gets me," he pretends to wipe a tear from the corner of his eye, "you sure are a creature of habit, aren’t you?" I shuffle backward and land partially in the water. He sobers up a bit, "do you know, that you pick the same place every time?" "I—" "I mean, it makes my job easier, but really? Some variated thinking might just save your life next time." He pauses, "oh well, ‘til then." 

He pulls the trigger.

I don’t feel pain, only pressure and the feel of the cold wind going through me. All at once, it’s black. 

I gasp awake. I’m on the train. I think I may have been dreaming. Straightening in my seat, I try to recall my dream in its entirety. It’s all too fuzzy and I give up. I look up to see a man across from me, just staring. Feeling uncomfortable, I reach into my pocket and pull out my phone. As I do, I received a call from a number I don’t recognize. Typically, I would ignore it, but I felt compelled to answer. "Hello?" the person on the other line says. I was shocked, despite everything becoming clearer. I easily recognized the voice.

It reads as such;

“I guard the oldest tree which has been named Demeter after the god of nature. My job is the most precious thing that I remember, maybe that’s because that is the only memory I have ever had. Demeter is the most beautiful sight a human can ever see. It’s beautiful colourful leaves, it’s soothing shadows and the five doves that fly around it and sing a requiem for every dead leaf. Many people at their lowest come to visit the tree and leave anew. Sometimes I get so mesmerised by the beauty of Demeter that I forget to eat or drink for 2 days straight and whenever I don’t eat for a day I shrivel up to bones and skin as if I was a mummy. My boss, a kind pilgrim, brings me food and water and scolds me whenever he sees me in such a state. I apologise for the ramble, I just can’t help but go on about Demeter every time I think of it.

But recently a terrifying phenomenon has been occurring but no one knows of it yet. One flower has withered in the flowerbed behind it, the doves are flying slower and singing less and worst of all, the grass around has started dying. I called for my boss and for the first time since I was born, I saw something other than a smile on his face. He got on his knees and started praying, sweat and tears pouring out of his face. After hours of praying and crying he got up to go the temple, I suggested I go with him but he shouted at me and told me to stay in my place. 

I asked my boss why this happened and he isn’t answering so I sneaked into the temple behind him to try to have at least half of a clue of what could be causing this. I walked into horrors, several corpses laying still on the floor of the ‘holy’ temple. 2 pilgrims praying for ‘blessed blood’ and ‘everlasting life’. Every corner of the temple reeked of filth and rot. The reason of the rot of the tree was anger, anger from Demeter herself for the atrocities committed in the place built to save her. Anger from the betrayal of her worshippers. Anger from everyone who let it happen and ignored it. 

catastrophes won’t happen now. It could be a thousand or a million years but anomalies will occur through the safe years. Expect less rain, hotter suns, corrupted humans and hatred spreading throughout earth and beyond. As the years go on chaos will be the only known state this world will be in, humanity committed their sins and now they must atone for it. 

I have written this note in hopes that maybe somebody will pick it up one day and warn everyone else. all the pure ones save yourself before you are corrupted too and start yearning for power. All the tainted ones are already long gone, they will kill themselves out one by one with their greed growing bigger than the others. I will sit down and pray for the pure ones to survive and make Demeter bloom again, bringing peace once again. Please save yourselves in anyway possible, I want Demeter’s love to live even after my death.”

I don’t know how old this note is, but I don’t think we are too far away from the catastrophes happening now. Ready your shelters and collected seeds everyone, it’s our only hope.

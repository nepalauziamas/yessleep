So it’s been an [eventful few days](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/v3f8ue/i_answered_a_phone_call_and_it_was_the_worst/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), but I think it’s taken a toll on Mrs. P the most. Mr. P and I are shaken too, but Mrs. P is incredibly stressed out and all that stress seems to be released only by buying huge packets of rock salt. I’m sorry for her credit score.

I should probably give you some background, though.

Mr. and Mrs. P touched down back here a day-ish after I first contacted them, and they wanted to go back to their house at first, obviously. I told them, *“Hey, maybe that’s a bad idea, considering, you know, EVERYTHING?”*

But I understood where they were coming from, because their house obviously had gotten broken into. I wasn’t gonna go near the house, but I was on the phone with Mrs. P while they tried to use their keys to get into the house. They were able to do so after the police were called and inspected the house for anything suspicious or anything stolen.  A report was filed, I presume, but I don’t know all the specifics of *that.*

So, obviously, they were both a little unsettled when they were finally able to walk into their house. But here’s the thing: they had lived in that house for sixteen years, and they’d seen it go through everything short of a fire. Mr. P had actually been the one to do most renovation projects within the house, and he was confident he knew the place like the back of his hand. Even a break-in or a home invasion should not have been able to make them feel lost in their own home. And no, I don’t mean lost metaphorically.

I’ll write it how it was described to me: a mindfuck. Imagine your house. You know what the floor feels like when you walk on it barefoot or with shoes. You know about how much distance there is between you and the kitchen cabinet. Even with your eyes closed, you could find your way through your house. Now, keep your eyes closed. When you open them, everything looks the same, but the floor feels different and everything seems further away and more to the left. It’s simple disorientation in the space you are supposed to feel safest, where suddenly things are not at a comfortable distance and you start to feel concerned at first. Then you set your things down, try to cook yourself something to eat. Every pot and pan is in the wrong place, but is arranged pristinely, and you start to doubt yourself–maybe you simply left these things like this?

If that paragraph unsettled you, imagine feeling that for hours. Not being able to go to sleep because of the fact that someone else was in your home when you shouldn’t be, and feeling like the house was a little bit alien, instinctually feeling that you should not be there. Terrifying, isn’t it?

Basically, they checked into a hotel in the late night or early morning of the next day.

Meanwhile, I wish I could say I’d been doing a little more research on the hellspawn couple that had brought me a mess and forty-thousand dollars. (Don’t worry, I haven’t spent the money on gambling. There’s a bit too much going on right now for me to gamble.) Unfortunately, I hadn’t.

The more and more I think about this, the more I’m convinced the timings match up and that the simultaneity of these events is not a coincidence. Mr. and Mrs. P checked into a nearby hotel at around 2am, so they must have left their house only a short while before, and everything started happening to me a little after 1.

The reason I’ve given up, for now, on trying to contact A and Mister Motherfucking Casino is because I don’t think this shit is a prank anymore. I think that either I was set up with this whole thing, or maybe I didn’t follow all the rules right, or *something* must have gone wrong, because the voice that spoke to me on the porch started talking to me again right around that time. I still don’t know if there’s one of them or multiple voices, because they’re not yelling at me anymore. They whisper now, and every single whisper is a variation of the same message. They want me to go back to the house.

The whispering woke me up, and I started screaming like a banshee and now I have a noise complaint and my landlord doesn’t like me but that’s the least of my problems. I drove over to Mr. and Mrs. P’s hotel, they let me into their room, and at some point during the car drive, the whispering stopped.

We all came to the conclusion that there was an arrangement made between the hellspawn couple and someone else. They got me to deliver something, and whatever was in the box and whoever picked it up fucked the house up somehow, and the voices want *me* to come back but the house seems to be rejecting Mr. and Mrs. P, based on how it seemed strange and weirdly labyrinthine to them. Obviously I wasn’t gonna go back in the house, and we all agreed that that would be stupid.

There was kind of this weird limbo for a while where we bounced between ideas trying to figure out what to do next: Mrs. P took a sick leave from her workplace, I didn’t have a workplace to take a sick leave from, and Mr. P gave himself a sick leave from his workplace (he’s self-employed). They could hardly sleep, and I think I’ve slept for like three hours total during this mess of a week.

But when I went to the hotel lobby to go get breakfast and froze and squeezed my eyes shut, some staff assumed I was having a panic attack or something and told Mr. and Mrs. P that “their child seemed to be unwell.” They figured out that it was probably Round 2 of the whispering, and that sort of cemented their resolve to find a solution.

Let me tell you, it’s really hard to focus on two well-meaning people telling you they’re going to exorcise the voices while those same voices are telling you to go back to the house. It feels like you’re underwater and have earbuds in, and you can’t really focus on anything but the bubbles you’re trying to breathe out.

Lolol one of these days I’m gonna end up breaking tf down

Anyways, I was basically there but not really, but I was trying to be present (dad take notes!!!).

I figured they must have done a Google search or something, because while one of them stayed with me to keep an eye on me (not really sure what they could have done though), and the other one brought whatever it is you need for an exorcism.

They basically threw salt in a circle around me and lit like seven of those fake candles with the switches on them and then said something in Latin. This went on for a while, and eventually they gave up. The voices didn’t stop, but I think I got used to the sheer noise, in between the whispering and the yelling and the crying, and I still feel like I’m underwater with earbuds in, but it’s like when you see a watery version of everything–like the moment before you break the surface.

I mean, I guess in some way the exorcism worked. From now on I’m gonna stop calling it that, though. Anyways, Mr. and Mrs. P were super crushed that their emergency intervention didn’t have the effect they wanted.

We looked up “supernatural investigators” and they either thought we were phonies or we thought they were phonies.  Literally five of them laughed at us.

But there was this guy–let’s call him Reonardo Lex. He seemed like he knew what he was talking about, and when we mentioned the delivery, and everything after it, he said he would personally come to our hotel room to help us. Mr. and Mrs. P were antsy about that, said *no thank you, not the hotel room,* and so we met up at some library.

Apparently it’s really old and renowned, but I’ve never heard of it. But based on what Reonardo told us all, there’s a lot of stuff I’ve never heard of.

He’d been in this business for quite awhile and had met a lot of curious cases that people like us were affected by. For our case, what he needed to do was isolate the voices that had been bothering me, ask them what they really wanted, get down to the bottom of it, and then go into the house and do a cleansing or something.

We took a walk down a few streets and then into a *really* sketchy house, and I was wondering if maybe we were fools, but the thought of finally being free of whatever all this was too appealing. There was a basement which of the four of went down into, Mr. P. had 911 on speed dial in case this turned out to be a murder setup (I learnt this when he tried to angle his phone screen towards me. I think he thought he was being discreet, but he absolutely was not.) For the second time this week, I was made to stand in a circle. It was made of playground chalk, though, not salt.

Reonardo Lex didn’t pull out a book or start singing in Latin or anything. Instead, he made Mr. and Mrs. P stand in another circle, and then he stared at me. It was really unnerving, but also really awkwardly. I started cracking my knuckles like a fool. After a while, the whispering seemed to get louder again, more agitated, and rose in volume until it was yelling. At this point it wasn’t focused on me at all. It was like the voices were scared of being looked at, and I thought I’d go deaf because of how loudly they were cussing at him. Covering my ears didn’t do anything either.

Worst. Experience. Of. My. Life.

It had to have been a good minute after the yelling started that it seemed to get quieter. There were still a *lot* of angry words being thrown around, though, and it was like a weight came off my shoulders. Something like a shadow *slithered* across the floor, and it was like I was feeling relief and dread at the same time. I’m going to start carrying aspirin with me.

It was visible to everyone else, too, considering the shrieks from the corner of the basement and Reonardo clenching his jaw.

The worst part of all of this, though, is he started having a conversation with the shadow while it tried slithering around him, almost like it was making its own circle. And he kept on looking at the floor while he did it. How do you even try to make eye contact with a shadow?

The conversation went like this:

R: *Why are you here? What do you want?*

S:  *It wants her, and it wants a woman and a man who have deceived it.*

R: *Who are the woman and the man? How did they deceive anyone? And what, for the love of God, is it?*

The shadow didn’t say anything else. It just reared up, like a *fucking snake,* hissed, and vanished.

After that, Reonardo and Mr. and Mrs. P had A Talk. It was them yelling at him about what the fuck was going on. I would’ve joined in but I was too tired. I think I almost fell asleep on the floor. “For what it’s worth,” Reonardo said, attempting to placate them, “I don’t think it will come back to taunt any of you after this. It would be too much trouble, and you guys could always come back to me.”

There was some more yelling about payment and never hiring him again, but his reply stuck with me. It was the only other part of the conversation I really paid attention to. “I’m sticking around. You certainly don’t have to pay me now, but whatever this whole thing is, it looks like it’s a bit bigger than I thought it would be, initially.”

I agree with him the more I think about it.

Nothing does look like what it seems. Whatever or whoever is in the house, if you’re reading this, I’m going to sue you for *severe* emotional distress. Do they have supernatural lawyers

I think I have a good idea as to who the man and the woman who deceived “it” are, and now I think we need to know what was in the box. On the bright side, the whispers haven’t come back, though.

This is like the only hobby I’ve had for the past few days so like. Haha

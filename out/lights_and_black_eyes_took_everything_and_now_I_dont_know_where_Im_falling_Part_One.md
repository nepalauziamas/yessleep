My father once called me out to the hutches, his aviary as he was overly-fond of calling it, to talk. I was about eleven years old, and even then found his beckoning bizarre. 

He was a drinker; a dyed-in-the-wool alcoholic. He wasn’t abusive, or even unkind; he was just vacant in the way he looked, and acted. His eyes were craggy and dipped in a red fog for all of his waking hours, and they always seemed to be wandering past the scope of his vision, past a thousand yards and a thousand more, looking for something that he would never find.

What it was that he was looking for I can’t say with any degree of certainty, and certainly I had no notion back then, when my eyes were still new and hungry for whatever it was that was in front of me. His vacancy, his hazy meandering, his listing voice, his words that would gently roll into each other; that all seemed normal to me. I had no cause for alarm, but I also had no context that might hint that my Dad wasn’t okay. 

I only knew back then that out in the balding patches of yard, beyond the barn where the bespoke, wooden hutches lay, my father would sit on an old chopping block and suck down bottle after bottle of tan liquor from green bottles that had yellow labels; gulping at them like a choking victim gasping for breath.

I think he preferred the kind of company the birds could offer. Raptors are’t very vocal animals, typically. They screech, and when they do the piercing shrieks can be felt in the juice of your eyes, but when they perch it’s almost like they become less animal and more object. So, among those statues made of flesh and feather, I think my father found some measure of peace for his eye’s wanderlust that was evidently impossible for him to reproduce quite exactly, anywhere else.

When I went back to his aviary, all of those years ago, he spoke simply, resolutely. This was jarring in its own right.

“It’s time for you to learn”, he said. “These raptors... they’re gonna be yours someday. Your responsibility, anyway; it’s hard to say if you can actually own a bird-of-prey. You can certainly buy one, but ownership? That’s probably over-playing your hand.”

That was the beginning of me learning the falconry trade from Dad. The next few years, I followed after him; cleaning hutches, hooding, trimming, coping beaks, and pretending I didn’t notice his drinking, which the years had shown as a slow and creeping sort of malignancy.

As I have become older, practically his age when he first began teaching me, I now see the actual punishment for his vice: stagnation: he never became worse, never mean or scary, and he held onto his nourishing and kind demeanor with a sort of rigor mortis grip. He never abused or damaged me, my mother, or my brother. To my memory, he never even raised his voice. 

But, he never was able to grow beyond the green glass bottle he had planted himself in, his roots scraping the heel of his green glass, whiskey soaked prison. He was anchored in a bleary stasis just beyond that yellow label.

Years on, realizing that Dad’s abuse was turned inward on himself gave me pause. Mourning him stretched on and on well past his death, and mourning itself became an entity of slow malice in my own mind; the ghost of his self loathing slithered its way through my thoughts, haunting me with shame and doubt for the rest of my life. 

Had I done this to him? Will I drive anyone else into that limping poison? Would my love and affection, and respect, toll anyone else with that curse of living putrefaction?

With either wisdom or cowardice, I’ve never let myself find out. 

I live alone on the farm; its sprawl lapping up the years in vacuous indifference, as if the paddocks and barns, fields and streams, lonesome oaks, and earth were daring time to do what it could to destroy it. 

I didn’t, or couldn’t understand just a few days ago, that time itself is indifferent; I think, or I’ve come to believe that reality has cancer.

I play little or no part in the farm’s upkeep; it seems to do well enough on its own. I’ve got a deal with an Amish family, my closest neighbors, that involves using the south paddock in exchange for some general maintenance. 

Its a fine enough arraignment, though the youngest of the Stoltzfus children sometimes pester me for pop drinks. 

I spend very little time out on the property. Hal and me? We wander further. 

The county pays, and I suppose Hal, to tend the municipal landfill. Well, they used to pay me. I guess that’s probably the least of my problems now. 

Landfills are thin places. They are bellies of earth over-stuffed with decaying and putrefying bits of us, and like all decaying bellies they are digesting themselves; life, in death, attracts life. 

Specifically, and without my manufactured profundity, gulls and crows. The gulls are pretty far inland here, having tracked the mouth of the Susquehanna up from Chesapeake and making landfall on the New Oxford municipal landfill. They’re a pretty recent additions to the area, but I reckon it to be one large flock that got turned around in the last tropical storm of last year, getting blown north east from the Carolinas.  

The crows are local, and the clever little bastards are most of my job. 

I was tying up some hood tack when Lloyd Fletcher from the county came by with the job offer.

“We’d pay ya. Lord knows how expensive these birds must be”, he boomed with his back-slapping sales voice. 

“They do eat quite a bit of pretty expensive meat”, I replied. I didn’t like when folk called my girls ‘birds’. Dad didn’t either. They’re raptors. They were raptors. 

I suppose it doesn’t matter much, anymore; bird or raptor, they’re gone either way. It’s all gone. 

Or maybe it never was. Maybe I was always here, and I only dreamed of a life beyond this cold place full of lost and horrible things.

Around five o’clock in the morning a week ago, on a Thursday, I was making my usual metallic racket, loading Hal’s cage into the back of my station wagon. As I settled the cage into its nest of blankets, I noticed Hal, usually the more stalwart of us, had cocked her head. I couldn’t see her eyes for the leather hood, but I could tell she was listening for something. 

In the washed out pitch of early summer morning in deep Pennsylvania, it’d be hard to spot your own knuckles; the lumbering breeze would skim hot, and low like a fevered breath so that even the crickets would get drowsy and quiet. I couldn’t hear or see anything down the stone driveway, and Mt. Pleasant Road stretched on through the darkened swaths of raw umber and green fields with no headlights on either horizon. 

I took a breath, trying to exhale the odd amount of tension that the moment seemed to swell for no particular reason I can recall; the air just seemed weighted. 

I turned back around from looking down the long driveway and closed my old Subaru up. I closed the wagon with a loud and lazy push, and just as the dome light in the car clicked off, I saw a small figure standing in the garage for a brief moment, like a camera flash. 

“Who’s there?”, I croaked out. They were the first word’s I’d spoken out loud that day, and maybe for the last couple of days, so they sputtered out of my throat with added difficulty. 

“Mr. Thomas”, came a small voice with the familiar sing-song warble of a Pennsylvania Dutch accent.

“Jakey?”, I asked. 

Little Jacob Stoltzfus stepped out of the dark garage, and into my line of sight. He was the youngest of Alvin’s children, around seven years old, blonde hair poking out from under his brimmed straw hat, and all of his fearless fifty-five pounds in his four foot frame strode toward me with the odd confidence of any young Amish that had been working the fields since they could walk. 

“Did I surprise you, Mr. Thomas?”

“Yeah, you did. Didn’t surprise Hal, though.”

“I didn’t figure as I might sneak up on a hawk, Mr. Thomas.”

“She’s a peregrine, not a hawk, Jakey.”

He gave me a sheepish up-and-down, no doubt working up the nerve to ask me for what he was really standing in my garage at that early hour for. 

After a long moment of waiting for the boy to relocate the same fearlessness that brought him over to my place, I spoke for him. 

“If you promise not to tell your dad, there’s orange pop in the fridge”, I said, pointing toward my father’s old Kenmore in the back of the garage. 

I quickly walked past him, toward the old green refrigerator, grabbed the fake wooden handle, and opened the accordion rubber seal open slowly, letting the car-seat leather-from-skin peeling sound that the old ice box made smack me back in time for just a moment to my childhood. 

Lost in the early morning haze and a leak in my memories, the next thing I felt was a hand, slight and quick, tugging on my shirt. 

I turned around, startled out of my red-eyed stupor by Jakey. 

“Oh, sorry. It’s early, I haven’t had my coffee yet”, I said. 

“Didja forget what I’m here for?”

“Honestly I forgot what I’m here for.”

I handed him a can of orange pop, closed the fridge, straightened his little straw hat, gave him a grin and a shrug, and headed off to the car. 

“Goin’ to the Little Britain Store?”, he asked as I climbed into the driver’s seat. 

“Probably ought to.”

“Da says Lacker’s coffee is fit to pave the road with”, chirped Jakey as I shut the car door. I started the engine, and rolled down the window as the little boy popped open his can and took a large gulp. 

“So we know it’s more reliable than the roads around here. Be good, and don’t let your ‘Da’ catch you with that can.”

I waved, put the car in gear and creaked off down the driveway, hearing the crunch of the gravel and the soft clanking of Hal’s cage as it gently bumped and settled in the divots just before the mailbox. 

The drive out to the landfill is a sloping meander through a wide valley of patchwork fields. In the gentle, pale stone blue light of pre-dawn, the swaths of brown and green all ran together, like an oil panting soaked in water. 

I didn’t even look at the road; I was on autopilot until I got to the Little Britain Store, got some of Lacker’s mud in me. That’s why I noticed the thing at all, I think. Or maybe it was the way it moved?

At first I thought it must have been a plane, low and with extra landing lights, but it didn’t keep a course like they usually do, cutting up north passed the hills to the small airport outside of Lititz. This thing seemed to be tracking me, not following or shadowing me, but more like an animal might back away from you without taking it’s eyes off of you as you move toward it. It seemed almost playful. 

I drove toward it, its brilliant indigo and orange pulsing like a fluid around the opaque object, for what seemed only a few minutes. 

I didn’t deviate from my route, I think. 

I thought, anyway. 

I couldn’t define its shape, the solid part, but I remember getting the feeling, or maybe the impression that it was rotating on its side, or changing its orientation somehow. 

I just kept watching it as I drove. The car seemed to fade away from beneath me; I no longer was aware that I was driving, or even holding a steering wheel, or sitting. I was just tumbling towards the thing in the sky, always in my future, never in my past. It was as if it was a singularity: an infinitely small and dense thing that pulled me toward it.

A loud and sudden thud shot me forward from the back of my brain and out through my eyes, which were searing in a bolt of sunlight, the shock of which made me wince, tense up, and clench my fists so that I crushed the hot cup of coffee in my right hand.

I dropped the cup, shook some of the coffee off of my beet red, burnt hand, and tried to regain some composure. 

“Tommy? You ok?”

“Lloyd?”, I asked back. 

“I’m over here”, said Lloyd as he climbed a steep ridge about thirty feet from the car, “you seem a little out of it.”

“Where are we headed again? I think I got a little distracted.”

“I got a call from a surveyor from that lumber company outta Quarryville. Said they thought that there might be some sort of avian disease. And since you’re the bird guy...”

“Raptors, Lloyd.”

“Sorry, raptors.”

I scanned the tree-line above me, searching. 

What was I searching for? That object dipped in throbbing liquid brilliance? The grim thing from the tunnel? The lost sky beyond the black window? It’s hard to say what manner of inscrutable horror I might have been looking at without knowing. Before. 

It was Hal. I remember, I was looking for Hal. 

I realized that I didn’t have Hal, but I was wearing my gauntlet. I whistled for her, and her reply screech seemed far off afield. Too far than I’m normally comfortable with, but close enough to put me a bit at ease. 

“Why didn’t you tell me that before I let Hal go off?”

Lloyd looked at me, his round face already beaded with sweat, “The hell are you - I absolutely told you that before you let Hal out. God damn, I practically begged you not to. Are you sure you’re alright?”

“Yeah. Yes. I think so. She’ll be ok. So what exactly did this surveyor say he found?”

“She said that we’d know what she’d found as soon as we saw it.”

“Alright, Lloyd. Lead the way.”

I climbed up after him, awkwardly at first as I was still disoriented from whatever it was that had happened. 

I didn’t know what had happened then, a part of me working desperately to delude myself, into shrinking that thing, and my lost morning, into nonissues. 

We lumbered slowly through the thick bramble and ropey green growth on the floor of those thin woods for a nearly completely silent fifteen or so minutes, with only my whistles and her call back screeches to arrhythmically accompany the sound of our footfall and increasingly labored breathing as the morning grew hotter in the relentless summer sun.  

We got to the edge of the north line, which was a sudden ridge that cut down into the landfill itself, and into a fifth phase section. 

I was never a sanitation worker, though my paychecks came with the county sanitation department stamp on them, so I never really took an interest in what they did around the place, but I’d picked up a few bits of jargon from Lloyd and some of the regular crew I’d occasionally bump into. Phase five is the last phase, after the waste is broken down, and the ground can get reclaimed, but reclaimed is a misleading word, I think. See, there’s no old growth; its all new sod rolled over lumpy and porous earth. It seems unnatural, or uncanny; a bad impression of nature. 

“Over there”, shouted Lloyd, pointing to a spot about two hundred yards beyond the bottom of the ridge to the east. 

I squinted and saw what he was pointing at; from our vantage point above, it looked like the ground was speckled with little bits of different colored dirt. The bits were all large as my hand at least, and oddly arranged in a circle around a bald patch of fresh reclamation sod. It took a moment, but I understood what I was seeing: birds. 

Hundreds, maybe even a thousand dead birds lying in a perfect ring. 

“Jesus”, said Lloyd. 

I scanned the sky, and to my relief I saw Hal circling above us a couple thousand feet, or so. I saw her cut hard back toward the north west, in my direction. She tended to a wide parabola when she hunted, but this was a sharp turn, as if she was avoiding the ring of dead birds. 

Hal was always the smart one.

“What was a lumber surveyor doing out this way, Lloyd?”

“I don’t know. She didn’t say much on the phone before we got cut off.” He was starting to sound nervous, and as he spoke he didn’t take his eyes off the ring of dead birds below us. 

“Cut off?”

“You know how reception is out here.”

I didn’t want Hal anywhere near the ring, so I whistled and gave my round-up signal. She swooped low over my head, missing my gauntlet, and settled on a bare, and ancient looking red oak. She perched, preened a bit, and stared at me and Lloyd. 

Maybe it was just me she stared at. Maybe it was Lloyd.

Maybe she knew. I’m so sorry, Lloyd. 

“Fine. Stay here, then.”, I said to her. I took off my gauntlet and put it in my small messenger bag, and made off down the ridge without saying a word to Lloyd, who I could hear trundling down the loose, dry dirt and rocks behind me. 

I had to slide down the last few feet, which I was able to do without tumbling over myself. Lloyd wasn’t quite so graceful or lucky. 

After helping him up, and dusting him off, we set out to where we saw the ring of dead birds. The sun was climbing steady and was almost directly above us on that shadeless patch of manufactured green. 

A slow wind blew past us from the east, heavy with wetness and the smell of chemicals and decay, giving no relief from the heat. 

As we approached the ring, Lloyd slowed down, then he stopped. 

“Tommy, wait a second. Is this a good idea? What if it’s a biohazard sort of deal?”

The thought had occurred to me, and it’d be false bravado to say that the thought hadn’t scared me, but I’ll admit that at that point, given my lost morning, and the heat swelling the air: I was curious. 

The ring wasn’t beckoning to me, like that light and that thing in the sky, but it’s otherness pulled me toward it, as if it was infecting me with a base need to understand it. 

I wiped my forehead with my bandana I kept in my back pocket, looked at Lloyd, then looked at the ring, which was only about fifteen feet away from me. 

I noticed something odd about the birds almost immediately. 

“I don’t think that disease did this.”

“How’d ya figure that?”

“These are all different species of birds. Maybe seven or eight different flocks, too.”

I walked up to the edge of the ring, which I could then say was about fifty or sixty feet in diameter, and motioned for Lloyd to come closer. 

“Disease is usually limited to one or two species, but these are all way too different. There’s some gulls, but there’s also song sparrows, robins, eastern blues, there’s a Canada goose, a bunch of finches, a turkey vulture, a wren...” I said, pointing at the dead birds as I saw them. 

“Ok, so what could cause... this”, asked Lloyd as he gestured around vaguely. 

“I’m not sure. It’s almost like they hit something. But that doesn’t make sense either, because they’re all different birds, so they wouldn’t have all been here at the same time.”

I pulled out a pen from my bag and knelt down at the edge of the ring. I poked at a dead finch, and rolled it over. It had some bleeding from its beak and eyes. 

I stood back up, and Lloyd and I looked at each other for a moment. 

“You think people coulda done this?”, Lloyd asked. 

I stared at him, blankly. 

“How?”, I asked slowly, letting the one word question stretch out to emphasize my point.

“Like some punks kill a bunch of birds and lay em out like this. Like a cult thing.”

I ignored his question, letting the silence loom over us for a moment. That’s when I heard it. That’s when I noticed it. 

“There’s no crows”, I said frantically as I scrambled around the death soaked sod, searching for a crow. 

Not one amongst the hundreds of dead birds, nor had I heard or seen one since I had gotten there, I think. 

Clever little bastards probably knew. 

I looked toward the center of the ring. There didn’t look to be anything there; it was just a circular, bare patch of flat, sodded ground about twenty feet in diameter. 

I slowly began moving through the ring of dead birds, trying not to step on any, toward the center. 

“You see anything in the middle that they could’ve maybe flown into?”, asked Lloyd.  

“No...” I think I said. 

As I moved closer to the inside of the ring, the ground in the middle began to lens downward, as if something had dipped the earth there into a glass of water, and as my line of sight moved toward it, it shifted into what looked like a perfectly round bowl. 

It wasn’t a hole, or a ditch, or a divot; it was more like a dent in reality. 

The noon time sun was blaring straight down through that pale sky and it skipped slightly off of a spot about ten feet above where the ground ought to have been. Looking through the air in front of me, I remember that I could see the eastern tree line, shimmering with a warped glint. 

I don’t know why, but I felt a sudden urge to enter the middle of the ring, into what I can only describe as a large, invisible sphere. It wasn’t on the ground like things always are, and it wasn’t in the ground, buried; it was as if this thing rested on top of physical space the way a bowling ball would rest on a mattress, depressing and reforming reality around it. 

I thought I heard my name being yelled from behind me as I stepped into the center of the ring, but I couldn’t stop myself. It was like falling, a kind of vertigo, like the need to step off the ledge and let gravity tug you down. All the fluid in my body pulled forward faster than my denser bits, and it felt like my fall lasted forever. 

As I turned back, slowly flailing onto my back, I saw a hand reach toward me. I glimpsed up toward the sky, and instead of the pale blue dipped serenity of the hot summer sky at noon, I saw a purple vastness yawn out before me, swirling with bright flecks of stardust and proto-matter, like aerated bubbles in the vortex of a cosmic wash. 

I saw a wrist familiar to me, wrapped in a cheap, ill fitted Timex. I saw greying knuckle hairs swaying back and forth as if dipped in a pool. I saw Lloyd himself, beyond the barrier that I had fallen into. 

I was pulled into. 

When I saw beyond his wrist, up his thick trunk of an arm, and out of the twilit blue lacuna I was tumbling into, I saw his arm warped from his body, bent like light refracted through liquid, but there was no liquid; there was nothing between us but the contrived, convex barrier. His arm simply bent with it, like a blade of grass in the breeze. 

There was a type of cold in that space. It wasn’t cold like skin might be used to; there didn’t seem to be air that the cold could permeate through. Instead, it seemed like there was only the warmth of the undulating and swirling lights, like dead pulsars weaving about. That warmth touched my skin, and it warmed it, but as my mouth opened to scream, I felt the wetness of my tongue boil, as if it was made of dry ice.  

The upwards thrust of Lloyd’s yanking was abrupt in the same way that having your head lopped off would be; I was again standing on the edge of the ring of dead birds, neck throbbing, mouth burning, and still staggered by momentum.

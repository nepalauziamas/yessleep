 I don’t know what we were thinking. After all, we were full-grown adults. In a way, I guess we deserved it, almost. We sure were dumb as hell to have done what we have done. 

It started with us having just one beer too many, as many things do. One carton of beer too many, if I were being honest.

“Dude, what do I do now?” I asked, trying to crush my empty beer can with my bare fist and failing. 

“Suck it up, get back into work next morning, whinge about it at night. Rinse, repeat. Do as I do,” Trent said, eyeing my half-crushed can, while downing the last of his. 

I groaned. “I can’t do this anymore, man. Walking into that goddamn grey-ass building, taking that same elevator to the same floor, scanning the same pass through the doors, sitting at that same stupid desk, looking at the same bloody inspirational quotes, typing the same bloody words, looking at the same excel sheets…”

“Or don’t. Just quit. Rage quit. Do it. Get it filmed if you can,” Trent cut in, looking mildly exasperated.

I didn’t blame him. I had been making the same complaints almost every single time we met for the past year and a half. To be fair, he does his fair share of whining too. 

“You know how people say their dead uncles or grandfathers give them winning lottery numbers?” I asked, cracking open another can. “Why hasn’t any of my long dead relatives given me some help in that area? I don’t even need numbers. They can just tell me what shares to buy, you know?”

Trent chortled. “Mine are useless as well. I actually prayed for that once, you know? Like really knelt down, put my head to the ground, prayed. Give me the magic numbers, please. I need the help, please! Nada. I guess my ancestors don’t give a shit about me.”

“Maybe we’re doing it wrong. Maybe we can’t just ask. Can’t just go to bed and hope to dream of them. Or pray. Or ask the empty air for help. Maybe we need to visit their graves. Pour some top-notch whiskey on their graves, ask for help at midnight, or something,” I suggested. 

“Bring a Ouija board maybe? Or maybe we record or video record thin air. Who knows, we find their answers in the footage. Maybe we see the image of a lottery ticket. Or a Reddit pennystock,” Trent chimed in. 

While I had originally meant it as a joke, I couldn’t help but feel the vines of excitement beginning to lace themselves around my heart. It’s not that I thought such stuff would work, it’s just that I was desperate and willing to try anything. And honestly, it just sounded like a bunch of fun. Anything that was out of my sad, mundane, ordinary and painful life was a welcome distraction.

Trent noticed the grin on my face. He cocked an eyebrow. “What’s up with that look? Oh dude, are you serious now? You wanna actually try that?”

“Maybe not the Ouija board thing, or the video recording thing. Way too creepy, even for me. But I did hear of some way of summoning spirits. I remember some kids playing some game of summoning when I was a kid. I didn’t have the balls to join them then, but hey, it could be fun now.”

Trent stared at me, his eyebrow still cocked, the crease between his brows scratching itself deeper in.

“You’re serious,” he said, reading my expressions.

I smirked. “You scared?” 

He rolled his eyes. “Aren’t we too old to be calling each other chickens?”

“Pok,” I said, looking him dead in the eye. “Pok…pok.” 

He sighed heavily. “I’m not a child. I’m not going to fall for your stupid dares and childish…”

“Pok pok pok. Pok? Pok pok.” I continued.

“FINE!” Trent grunted, running his hands through his hair and making an exaggerated sigh. 

“Awesome. Now, all we need is paper, pens, pencils, and maybe a sterilised knife,” I said, trying to recall what the kids had said all those years ago. I must have been 9 or 10 then, but I remembered the materials pretty well, because I had been in part intrigued and in part terrified by the kids’ talk of the game.

“A sterilised knife? What the hell, you gonna make a sacrifice or something?” Trent gave me a look of affront.

“Nope! So, it’s really simple, dude. You just take a piece of paper, you draw a house on it, and you can make the house as grand as you want. Then you draw whatever you want to offer the spirit-to-be in it, to tempt one to enter the paper house. Back then, the kids I hung with said they drew hamburgers and fries, and nothing happened. I mean, duh, right? We definitely need to up the ante, draw like, I don’t know, a Playstation 5 in there, a Nintendo Switch, a Porsche, top shelf whiskey, stuff like that,” I said, trying to think of irresistible rewards that spirits would whoop at. 

“Okay…” Trent muttered, looking unconvinced.

“Then we draw a piece of paper stating what we want in return. In one of the rooms of the house, or just anywhere, I guess. Then we nick our thumbs a little, and use the blood to stamp our prints on the paper.”

“Ah. So that’s where the knife comes into play. I’m relieved. I mean, I wouldn’t put it past you to suggest something insane. Not that this is perfectly sane, but you know. At least there’s no goat heads to severe,” Trent joked. I had half a mind to joke about the next step being to sacrifice one of us to soak the entire paper in blood, but decided not to. I was honestly getting a little spooked by the recall of the game. 

“What say you? We’ve nothing to lose, man. Except a couple teeny weeny drops of blood,” I said, looking expectantly at him. 

“Ah damn that look. I know there’s no dissuading you. You’re just gonna keep bugging me about it until I say yes, right?” Trent asked. I nodded emphatically.

“Fine,” Trent said, looking aggrieved, but I knew him well. I could catch the little glint of anticipation in his eyes. I knew he liked this stuff, was fascinated by stuff to do with the supernatural. I mean, his favourite TV series were X-Files and Penny Dreadful. “When shall we do this thingy of yours?” He asked.

“Right now,” I said, and left the living room to head to my study. I found a large piece of cardboard paper, two pencils, an eraser, and a penknife. I went back to the living room and deposited these items in front of Trent. “Hold up,” I said, and headed to the kitchen, where I retrieved a bottle of cheap vodka and a cup before returning.

“Steriliser,” I said.

Trent simply nodded, acting resigned. “So what now?” 

“Now, we draw a huge ass mansion.”

We were silent for a few minutes, drawing up a comically large mansion, with squares as rooms and a long flat line as the ceiling. I made sure to remind Trent not to draw a knob on the door. The knob would be drawn on when terms were agreed upon with the ghost guy. Then he/she/they could enter our world. 

When we were done with the terribly drawn mansion, we stared at the child-like drawing and laughed. 

“I think maybe things work differently there. Like you know, with those drawing apps, your shitty lines get straightened out or curved perfectly by their algorithms? Maybe it works that way for them,” I joked.

“I sure hope so, cos otherwise, no one in their right mind will accept this mansion as a bribe.”

We began drawing in random rewards. I did indeed draw in the PS5, but I decided to draw a Rolls Royce instead of a Porsche. Seemed more suited for old-timey spirits. Trent drew a pile of gold and diamonds. Pretty smart of him. I soon followed his lead and began drawing piles of cash, in different currencies, just in case the spirit was from France or something. I simply labelled them though, I’m not that good at remembering or drawing money. For good measure, I drew a couple bottles of whiskey and wine. In case they weren’t the hard liquor type of spirits. Pun intended.

We sat mocking each other’s lousy scribbles for a while, then discussed what to write on the piece of paper that would serve as a contract. 

“I’m a simple man,” Trent declared. “I just want 5 million dollars.” 

I smirked. “We’re getting in contact with ghosts for 5 million? Make it 10 million dollars, dude. Each.”

“Nah, if we push for too much, they’re gonna balk. Or demand more offerings. Or at least demand better drawn offerings,” Trent said.

“Fine,” I said. “5 million. We split it, 2.5 each.” We looked at each other and burst into laughter. We were speaking like it was a proper contract, like we were definitely going to get the money. Still chuckling, we wrote it in. *Help us get 5 million dollars*.

Our laughter petered off and we fell into an uneasy silence, both staring at the vodka and the pen knife. Finally, in a show of bravado, I poured a generous amount of vodka into the cup, then dipped the pen knife in it, swirling it a couple times. 

“Let the games begin,” I said, smiling cockily to hide my nerves. Then I pricked my thumb with the tip of the blade. I was surprised by how sharp it was. It immediately dented and broke through my skin, forcing out a bright red dot of blood. As Trent flinched, I squeezed the cut a little more, and rubbed the blood around my thumb. “Here goes nothing!” I said as I pressed my thumb to the piece of paper drawn within the cardboard paper.

I dipped the pen knife in the vodka again, swirled it around, while sucking on my thumb to stop the bleeding. Then I handed the blade to Trent, who seemed nervous. He stared uncertainly at the pen knife, then at me, and with a small resigned sigh, he followed suit.

Our thumb prints were now on the paper. 

We waited. Nothing seemed to happen.

I felt disappointed, then silly for being disappointed. This was just for fun, of course it wouldn’t happen.

“Spirits, ancestors, ghosts and ghouls. Please help us out with our request, pity us fools!” Trent suddenly declared loudly, which elicited a childish chuckle from me. 

We were both snorting and ribbing each other when a grey scribble appeared on the page. Trent saw it first, and he jabbed me hard in the ribs.

I was about to protest when I saw it too. It was a humanoid silhouette, looking as if it was drawn with densely scribbled pencil lines. 

We both stared, jaws ajar. I could feel an icy needle threading its way up my spine, piercing deep into my heart.

“The fuck?” I whispered.

The silhouette began to move. It first moved to the car, then the gold, the diamonds, and the PS5. 

It made its way to the contract we had written and sealed with our prints. Its doodle of a hand touched the “contract”. 

Our blood prints began to dissolve into a puddle on the page. Before our terrified eyes, the blood began to seep out in veiny shoots, until they formed large letters that scrawled their way across the entire cardboard paper. 

*Agreed. Let me out.* 

**“**HOLY SHIT, DUDE!” I yelled, grabbing Trent by his arm. “What the fuck dude, this is working, holy shit sacks!”

Trent was pale. I hadn’t seen his lips that ashen before. He seemed paralysed with shock. I shook him, and he seemed to come back to life. 

“I can’t…I…” He stammered, staring at the silhouette on the page with pure fear and fascination etched on his face.

“Should we do it? Draw the knob?” I asked, feeling a thrill rise within me. My salvation might be near. I could be close to freedom. I could be close to being rich. Finally. Never have to work a day in my life. 

“Dude, we need to be sure. I mean, what’s it gonna do to us once it’s out? Are our offerings enough? Does it want actual stuff or something?” Trent finally found his voice.

I frowned. Then, before Trent could stop me, I reached out and scribbled on the page again. 

*Are our offerings enough? Will they be all the payment you would need?*

Nothing happened for a while, then the blood letters began dissolving and forming new ones.

*With only one condition, to be specified later.* The words read. 

I was immediately filled with dread. Unspecified conditions, from mysterious entities. Never a good idea. Even in my greed and desperation, I knew better than to agree. 

Trent and I looked at each other, read the same intent in our minds, and nodded.

*Sorry,* I wrote. 

“How do we get rid of it now?” Trent asked. 

“I think we stab the pencil through the door where the knob is supposed to be,” I said, suddenly foggy on the details.

“YOU THINK?” Trent asked in an incredulous tone.

“I think so. Yea. I mean, I’m pretty sure.”

As we were arguing, the blood letters had reformed. 

*Get rid of the other one and you will have all the money you need.*

Trent and I stared at each other in horror, now convinced that the entity was fucked in the head and definitely evil. 

Trent gripped the pencil, and looked at me. I nodded. He jabbed the pencil through the door where the knob would have been.

The grey scribbled silhouette made a sudden run at the door, shrieking, a soul-freezing, bladder-emptying unearthly cry of evil and rage. We screamed in turn, and dropped the paper. We began to hear the door thudding. THE FAKE DRAWN DOOR. The cardboard paper was now faced downwards, but the crazed banging on the door coming from it was unmistakable. 

“WHAT DO WE DO WHAT DO WE DO!” Trent screamed. I screamed, too, just to join in and release some of the terror I felt. 

After another few seconds of screaming, I felt a sudden calm. The kind of calm that settles over you when you’re in life-threatening danger. When you really need your wits to survive, and your brain, thankfully, doesn’t betray you. It cools everything down in a sudden moment of clarity.

“FIRE.” I commanded. Trent immediately understood the assignment. He sprinted to the kitchen, and switched the stove on. 

Before I could think about it and chicken out, I grabbed the piece of cardboard paper and dashed to the stove. I held the paper up to the fire. The shrieking from within the paper magnified. I felt a rush of nausea as the paper caught ablaze and the screams continued.

Forcing the rising vomit back down, I turned to Trent. “Thank god I didn’t listen to you and get the induction stove.” I held the paper for as long as I could, then dropped it in the bin, where it smouldered out.

We sank to the floor, limp with exhaustion. The fear had wiped us out. 

“Hey,” Trent said, after a short while. “Did you see the black smoke thing that rose from the paper?”

I bit my lip, hard. “Yea. But it was probably just the magic dispersing. Or the evil evaporating. Or something.”

“Right?” Trent asked. I nodded. We looked at each other, then looked away. I couldn’t bring myself to think of what the alternative may mean. 

We were silent for a long while.

“Beer?” Trent asked. I nodded, and we went back to the living room. Settling down on the sofa, I thought I heard a door creaking from upstairs. Trent didn’t seem to notice. It was probably just the wind[.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheDarkSeas/)

I’ve told this story in its entirety once in the fifteen years since it happened.  I’ve written it a million times in my head, but was too afraid to put it on the page. See, I think every time a story is told a piece of it will die; it’ll dig less deep, maybe mean something less. So, for selfish reasons, and some reasons that I can not fully understand, I don’t like to tell it. I want to hold onto it. I want to hold on to her memory. I want to hold on to my hope that I’ll see her again. 

But I can’t take this story with me where I’m going, so I’ll leave it here. Probably no one will read it. It’ll get quietly pushed into a dark corner of some database and dissolve like snow in hot water. But this is what happened, the inexorable void of what comes next for me be damned. 

It won’t matter if no one reads it; I know that they will. That they’ll see it, and they’ll come for me.

We were living near a town in West Virginia called Elkins, one of the thousands of the typical undead mountain hamlets that pock-marked Appalachia. 

The few people still there shuffled forward through time on rote zombie reflex in sleepy defiance of the finite amount of time every person is given to live a life. Tucked away in those hills a person could sit back on a porch and quietly wait out a whole life time listening to the wind and the woods, collecting stories that would never be told.

That’s one of the reasons we had moved there; the quiet was so profound it almost took on a personality.

It was strange how those mountains worked as neighborhoods, however. Driving up to our house would have you winding past particle board shanties, ramshackle cabins, and derelict houses slowly succumbing to the laws of thermodynamics; that very specific flavor of Appalachian squalor. But every so often along the roads you’d see private driveways shooting off behind those huts and bungalows, winding up and up until you’d get to the really nice houses you could see from town.

We lived up in one of those houses. The three of us (that is her and I, and our dog) fell in love with the kind of tranquil droning that happens in the deeper mountain woods; the creak of timber in a breeze, the dotted patter of leaves falling, the papery rustling of the forest floor getting kicked up by small game, and even the atonal cawing of the crows, sudden and shrill as it was, contributed to that quiet. 

We fell in love with living in that stillness, and we were ready to sit on the porch, and listen, and wait, for as long as we could do it together. 

Our border collie Wylie had a master craftsman’s dedication to causing chaos in that stillness, though all he managed to do was add timbre to that sedate rhythm the hills and trees and deer and birds all kept. 

 Main Street Elkins had a regular sort of sadness to it. There was nothing extraordinary about its past and then-current economic suffering, its battles, or genocides that would make it stand out in the background noise of our country’s everyday brand of bleakness. It was just a main street book ended by green and rusted steel bridges.

That’s what kept us from going into town much, I think. There wasn’t much in Elkins proper that compelled us to leave our mountain top. I regret that sometimes, but mostly I cherish the memories of me and her trouncing through the woods with Wylie, as he ripped up anything and everything he could in the dirt and brush, and barking with his brand of delirious dedication to chaotic disruption in his eternal quest for the better stick than the one he had. 

I was, and I suppose I am again by virtue of this, a writer. A technical writer, to be more specific. I used to take jobs from companies that I probably shouldn’t mention; companies that built fast airplanes, amazing new medicines,  and sometimes even weapons. Fill in the blanks, or don’t, at your discretion.

Forgive me, I haven’t written anything in years. It’s a tender muscle to flex and prone to spasms that show as digression. Might chop this up later. Might keep it raw, in case I forget something. I know she’d probably have encouraged me to edit this for my own sake. If I had to bet, I don’t think I will edit this, though. 

It isn’t for you. It isn’t for me, or even her. 

It’s for them. I know that they’re reading this. 

I want them to, and I want them to come and I want them to take me. 

I won’t scream. Not this time.

It was a Thursday in early February of 2008. It had been snowing for about five hours, and the sun was loitering behind a sheet of static colored clouds. I was a little surprised when the phone rang.

“Fuck me”, I yelped when the shrill electronic chime cut through the silence.

“Jesus Christ,” she said laughing, “do you think you might be getting a little too used to the silence?”

“No such thing.”, I quickly whispered while cradling the phone.

She rolled her eyes and went back to her book. She had taken to reading on my office sofa while I worked lately.

“Hello?”

Nothing. No dial tone, no signal of any kind. I hung up, shrugged, and briefly held her bemused and soft gaze. 

I remember tasting something metallic, as if for a moment I held a fistful of pennies in my cheek. I suppressed a gag, and took a sip from the tea she had made earlier. The honey sweet floral aromatics washed the bizarre taste from my tongue and my thoughts.

“Do you want anymore tea? I’m going to make lunch.”

“No, thanks. I’ll meet you up there. I just want to finish this section. I feel like I’ve been writing the same three sentences for hours.”

I liked having her there while I worked; Wylie had always been the one that kept me from rambling at the walls, but he had gone missing about a month before.

At first we were’t worried when he ran off. He’d gone off more than a few times for the better part of a day or more for reasons I figured I would never understand. I respected him enough to not fret too much about him. 

He was smart and more than capable after half a dozen years of living out there. But after three days, I went to town to check the animal shelter and see if he’d been spotted or hopefully even picked up. 

Of course, he hadn’t been. The nearest thing to a neighbor that I could ask was a drunk bait maker named Cal who lived in his Dad’s old hunting cabin about two miles from where our house was, maybe half that as the crow flies. I knew asking him if he’d seen my dog was a waste of time but I asked anyway. His response was to ask me who I was, which was frustrating, but completely reasonable given how little we ventured out beyond our property. 

By the end of the first week, I think we both knew that it would be best to just try and not imagine the worst case scenario, and we let it somewhat drop. But we did keep our pictures of him up. I began to imagine that he had gone out in some heroic way, like trying to chase a black bear off from the house. That did help blunt the pain of his loss.

With Wylie gone, my love took it upon herself to fill his role of my daytime work companion. I welcomed it with full awareness that this arrangement had an expiration date once the spring thaw made her gardening possible again. 

Sometimes I thought that she might have felt obligated to sit there in silence while I worked, but she was as reassuring as she had always been, and she would say that the clacking of my keyboard relaxed her. It’s an odd sort of comfort remembering the small things like that - coupled with my growing fear as I write them down.

She lilted away, up the stairs to the kitchen with that sly dance in her gait. It was hypnotic, the way a babbling stream might be. I remember following it the night we met, up the stairs of that house, at a party on Dorwart Street, I think it was... I know it was. She led me to a balcony to smoke cigarettes and talk, but I would have followed that step of hers right off of the roof.

That day, after that phone call, I didn’t follow her. I wish I had. I could have stopped her. I would have stopped her. 

Instead, true to my word, I sat and re-typed the same three sentences of whatever it was I was working on. I couldn’t even remember what this project was or how long I had been at it, I was just stuck on the last three lines. As soon as I looked away from the screen I would immediately forget what it was I was writing.

That kind of totally checked out forgetfulness was something I usually took as a sign that progress was probably just beyond my next break. I was almost tempted by the browser icon: the sing-song promise of the flat soft drink of social media promising a few small hits of neurotransmitters.  

I was snapped hard back into reality before I even had a chance to escape from it by a clattering in the kitchen.

“Hon?”, I called up. 

She didn’t answer me. I figured that she had probably dropped something and couldn’t hear me over the sound of her own frustration.

I shut off my monitor, and trudged up the steps toward the kitchen.

“Hon?” I asked again, quieter and expecting to see her on the floor as I climbed up, thinking I would be at her eye level. Across the floor I saw the metal salad bowl that had obviously been the source of the noise, surrounded by green lettuce bits, radish slices, carrot slivers, and her white and red sneakers, brick still as she was among the mess.

She was staring out of the kitchen window above the sink. That window had a partial view of the back yard, which sloped down into the tree line about two hundred yards away.

“Hon...?”

I could hear her breathing, slow but labored and deep. 

“Hon, what’s the matter?”

I began to step softly across the kitchen toward where she stood as softly as I could. I couldn’t see her face but I could feel her panic in the air like static energy. She was tense like a spring, as if she might leap out the window at any moment.

I couldn’t see through the window at what she was looking at; at my angle her head was blocking the view except for the grey sky and the snow frosted and bare tops of some of the taller sycamores just beyond the tree line.

I kept silent, watching the back of her head as I slowly stepped toward her. I could see her thick, dark chocolate hair, which was gathered in a loose pony-tail, waggle slightly as she trembled. 

Crunch.

Lost in the tense current of the moment, I had forgotten the salad on the floor. It loudly cracked and popped under my foot for what felt in that moment to be hours.

As the leaf finally gave way and turned to a green pulp beneath my moccasin, she sprung toward the kitchen door to her right like a predator cat bounding toward startled prey.

“Wait,” I yelled after her, but she was already halfway to the trees by the time I made it to the door, “what is it?”.

She didn’t answer. She didn’t even acknowledge me. She just kept running full tilt towards the woods until she disappeared below the slope down to the woods. I called her name over and over, I’m sure of it. But she never looked back.

I made it to the edge of the slope. What I saw as I ran to the short mound that crested the mountain and bordered our flat backyard made me stop fast on the edge of the icy swale.

Just over the treetops below me I saw a flat, circular cloud hovering completely stationary in total defiance of what a cloud does. It was moving gently up and down over one particular spot no more than a couple hundred yards away from the edge of the backyard. 

I only managed a brief glimpse of this bizarre cloud. The sight of it caused me to stop fast in my tracks right at the edge of the yard, and carried by my inertia, I slipped and rolled down the suddenly dramatic gradient toward the woods until I smashed into the trunk of a sycamore about fifty or sixty feet from where I had slipped. My chest bared the brunt of the impact.

I laid there for a few minutes, gulping helplessly at the frozen air like a punch drunk boxer, feeling wet gobs of snow pepper my tongue and throat. 

The snow tasted metallic, like pennies or maybe aluminum. 

I was on the verge of passing out when a low electrical thrum filled the air. It was so loud that the snow visibly vibrated as if it were being sifted in some in some gigantic colander. It shocked me into struggling to my feet, using the tree I had rolled into to slowly walk my hands up, counter-balancing on it against the increasing gradient of the mountain.

I could feel that low noise in my chest and teeth. I heard that sound in parts of my body that I am sure are not supposed to hear things. The pressure on my inner ear and sinuses was becoming unbearable and I screamed in pain. I screamed harder than I had before or since; so hard that the hernia that the strain of that scream caused me became the longest lasting of my physical injuries. 

But as soon as I stopped, so did the thrum. It was quiet. It was that eery snowfall quiet, where it seems as though the sound got sucked right out of the air.

I gasped and grunted as I sat down against the hill, my knees against the tree. I could feel a couple of ribs that had to have been broken. Every one of my ragged, crackling breaths came with a sharp pain at the top of my inhale. 

I took a few shallow breaths and slid myself out from the crook in the tree and the hill and let myself slowly slide down to a more level bit that I knew led to a small clearing beyond some thicket and bramble which I quickly figured was exactly where that cloud had been hovering. Where she had probably gone.

As I slid down the mountain side, clutching my throbbing chest trying to bare down through the pain and take a deep enough breath to keep from getting anymore lightheaded, I was beginning to become more and more aware that the metallic taste in my mouth was now accompanied by an increasingly sharp pain in my teeth. Specifically my back right molar. 

Isn’t it odd that any kind of tooth ache can override the brain, even in the most dire situations? At the time, I figured I had knocked a few of my teeth loose on the way down the hill. 

Vivre et appredre, no? Live and learn.

My growing tooth ache reluctantly moved to the back of my mind. I couldn’t call out to her; my chest and gut hurt too much to draw enough breath to say much of anything. I tried several times as I slid down to call out to her, each time the crackles from my chest were louder than my attempts to shout her name. I was just going to have to find her. 

After what seemed far too long to go a couple hundred yards down a hill, I made it to the bramble that grew along the outside of the leveled off clearing and saw that something had bored straight through the sharp mire directly into the clearing.

It was winter and the sprigs were sparse and bare. Even the thorny olive trees, with their crooked, barb covered trunks that looked like huge mantis claws growing from the ground seemed frail in the snow.

 It’s strange thinking back, how the perfect arch shape cut through the bramble seemed completely reasonable at the time. What’s more, it didn’t occur to me then that the metallic tinge in the air was now peppered with ash, smoke, and wood.

I stood uneasily and limped through the arch cut through the thicket, and made my way toward the clearing on the other side. About ten feet through the thicket I stepped on something soft that nearly caused me to fall over. 

It was a red and white sneaker. Her red and white sneaker, still tied. I left it there and pressed on.

I made it to the clearing, staggering out from the arched tunnel through the thicket.

“Hon?!”, I shouted, “where are y-”

I had to stop to adjust my eyes; it was blindingly bright in the clearing. There was not one cloud above me, there was no snow either falling or on the ground, and there was no wind. There didn’t even seem to be a temperature; it was neither warm nor cold. 

This is the first time I had admitted to myself that something unnatural was happening; her running off could have been her spotting Wylie and wanting to catch up to him, which is what I wanted to think right up until that moment when I stepped into the clearing.

The first thing I saw in the clearing was what I thought had to be a white tail buck. It had the general shape of a white tail buck, rack of antlers, and it seemed the right size. 

This fraction of a moment where it might have been a normal buck stretched around the clearing and lasted for what felt like hours. Finally, my eyes adjusted to the profound brightness in the clearing, and the thing took a step closer to me.

At first I had thought that it was about fifty feet away from where I stood at the entrance to the clearing. It hadn’t moved at all; it just stared at me. Not startled, not edgy... it seemed almost curious, I think.

 My eyes had just been flash cooked by the light change, so only when it moved did I realize it was actually much less farther afield than I had thought, probably only about fifty feet from me, and that it must have been about twelve or thirteen feet tall. It was also completely hairless, and its bare skin was a kind of matte gray, same as the sky was that day.

I don’t know if thats significant. 

As it slowly approached where I stood it didn’t take its eyes off of me. They were an impossibly bright shade of blue, and very large, and oriented wrong for a deer; more front facing than they ought to have been, which gave the thing an altogether too human looking face.  

It stopped coming toward me when it got about ten feet from me. It stared into my eyes and its head cocked to the side as if it was studying me, or maybe judging me would be the better word?

Then its head snapped around to the woods beyond the clearing behind it, as if it had been startled, but it did not move from where it stood, towering over me.

I hadn’t heard anything, but I followed its gaze and leaned over to look at what it was looking at. Its strange, but now that I’m writing this all out I’m finding myself wondering why the hell I didn’t run away, back out the way I came, up the hill, into the house, and called... someone. I don’t have a good answer; I was physically able to move at that point, and I was... terrified isn’t quite the right word... like I was anticipating something excitedly that I didn’t want to happen at all.

 The point is that I don’t think I wanted to leave and I have no good reason why I didn’t. It was as if somehow my fight or flight response had been shut off completely. Probably the same way you can catch frogs at night; shine a flashlight directly into their eyes in the dark then they won’t try to hop away.

I mention the frog catching thing only because of what happened next.

When I tried to lean over to look past the enormous stag creature I leaned too far to try and get a good look beyond it, but it was too big for me to simply lean, so I calmly stepped around beside it. The thing didn’t even seem to notice me anymore, as if this unnatural moment was now happening to us both.

It was a light that was moving through the trees beyond the clearing that me and the creature were looking at. At least that’s the only word I have for it. I’ll try a few more. 

It was as if the light was an object with material substance. It didn’t really shine as it were, it just filled the air with a weight, or a kind of density. But it was brighter than anything I had ever seen, even the sun, and moving toward me and the giant grey stag. 

It was fast and large. As it came closer I noticed the air getting warmer and that vibrating thrum was building again. I also noticed that it moved in straight lines, as if whatever this object was could simply pass through the trees themselves.

As it got to the edge of the clearing on the other side from where the stag and I stood, it became too bright to look at. I put my hand up to try and shield my eyes, but when I did I could see right through it. My hand was nearly completely transparent but with a vague reddish hue. It was almost like shining a flashlight through the back of your ear, when you can see all of the capillaries through the skin. But this light shone through skin, vein, muscle, and even the bones of my hand and arm.  

The heat that thing was throwing off was building in locked step with the brightness and deafening thrum. The air in my chest was vibrating against my shattered ribs so hard that I clutched at my shirt and fell to my knees.

 My ribs and lungs and all of my insides were now visible to me through my clothes and skin. I wasn’t invisible, the light was just so bright that it went right through everything. I may have started trying to scream but I couldn’t hear anything at that point to be able to tell if I was, though.

The light and the thrum and the heat continued to cook me, and I felt like I was being dismantled one atom at a time. I looked up at the stag creature, which had not succumbed in the slightest to the light or the sound or the heat. It was still as opaque as it had been, standing stolidly in that luminous carnage. 

 It was looking down at me. It lowered its head so that it was inches away from me, and it stared into me with its impossibly blue eyes, and I could swear that it seemed almost sympathetic towards me. 

I felt myself rip apart. It seemed slow, and I remember thinking at one point that whatever was obliterating me could have been more courteous and began my obliteration with my whatever part of me feels pain so that I wouldn’t have to endure this cosmically barbarous torture.

Finally, after yet another dilated moment of mind liquifying agony, there was emptiness. My whole being was excised from the light, and nothingness took me. In that negative phantasmagoria is where my consciousness finally dissolved like piss in a bath tub, and mercifully so also went the excruciating pain of my annihilation.

Time seemed to take the long way around that patch of infinity I sank into because when I came to, lying on the ground in my backyard, it was dark and it had stopped snowing. 

I staggered slowly to my feet, expecting a great deal more pain but instead I was greeted with just a general stiffness no more intense than my aging body might feel after a nap in my office chair. 

I thought of her, lying on the sofa.

I went into the house and called out for her.

“Hon?”, I managed to croak out. My throat was somewhat sore. I rubbed at it, and my hand found a tender spot: the back of my jaw. 

Prodding around with my tongue, I felt that my back right molar was much more unfamiliar feeling then I was used to, and throbbing steadily with a dull ache.

 I went to the bathroom, calling out “Hon? Where’d you get to? I think I must have fell in the kitch-”.

I turned on the bright lights above the mirror and pulled my cheek open to get a good look at my tooth and saw that I was missing my silver filling that I had had since the seventh grade.

“What the f-”

A loud banging at the door startled me so that I bit my own finger. I tasted the metallic tang on my own blood, as if my cheeks were stuffed with a fistful of pennies. 

“Hon, do you see someone at the door?”, I said, my voice beginning to waver. I knew she wasn’t there, but pretending that she was, that nothing had happened allowed me to suppress the sense of terror and wrongness that was building inside of me. 

I went to the door and stood on my toes and looked through the frosted glass window out to the porch. I didn’t see anyone, so I lowered myself back onto my flat feet that I then noticed were bare.

I had been wearing shoes, hadn’t I?

“Yes. Moccasins, I believe. The ones she gifted you.”

The voice was coming from the kitchen. It was hard to place as either distinctly male or female, and it had a a chirping quality to it that sounded almost insectoid, like a cicada or a cricket. 

Too disoriented for normal fear and too tired for panic, I walked toward the kitchen. I could hear rustling around as I slowly but deliberately made my way down the hall. My pace afforded me time to listen closely for what might be waiting for me when I got to the kitchen, and I could swear it sounded as if about a half dozen small animals had gotten in and where skittering about the place, rooting around for food or who knows what. 

When I got to the end of the hall and looked into the kitchen I scanned over the place from right to left. I saw the door that I remember her darting out of, then the window above the sink where she had stood staring at whatever had caused... all of this. On the floor was the salad she had dropped, which looked wilted and brown, as if it had been laying there for at least a day or two. 

Still scanning the room, I noticed the refrigerator looked different, somehow. Only later would I realizer that it was missing some photographs. 

To the left of me the door to the basement slammed shut. I heard nothing patter down those wooden steps, which could amplify the sound of one of Wylie’s tennis balls bouncing down them to the point where it sounded like a car rolling off of a cliff. I figured either a draft had slammed the door, or some uncanny horror. I was now too shell shocked to care which.

The front door banged again. This time it was repeated and somehow more human sounding than the first time, so I turned around, went back to the front door, and without checking through the window I swung open the door.

To call what stood on the other side of the door a man would be somewhat misleading; it stood about six inches taller than me and was wearing a bespoke gray suit and black tie, and it was holding what appeared to be a large tan rain coat and a black umbrella.

 Its mouth was a bit too wide, oriented upwards in the corners, and its lips were all but non-existent. Its eyes were human looking enough, though a very bright shade of blue, like a newborn’s and set strangly in it’s head. Its skin was, for lack of a better word, flawless. It showed no age, no pores, or marks of any kind - not even a single hair. 

“May I come in?”, it asked without the least bit of inflection or expression.

I stepped back and held the door open for it. I like to tell myself I was just being fearless and maybe too tired to be afraid to let them in, that I wanted answers and I was going to get them from whatever this thing or person was. However, the truth is that in the moment I felt as though I was on auto-pilot, like my behavior was being piloted remotely by someone or something that only had a vague idea of how people think and feel and act.

It walked past me, dropped its coat and umbrella on the floor and went straight down the hall to the kitchen. I followed it after it disappeared to the left toward the refrigerator.

It had opened the fridge, and was bent over rooting through it. It stood up straight, and turned around to look at me. It held up a bottle of Worstchestshire sauce.

“May I?”, it asked with a puzzled, maybe even playful, detachment. 

“Help yourself”, I replied.

It unscrewed the lid and brought it up to its wide mouth, pursed its pencil thin lips around it, and began to suck on it. Seeming unsatisfied, it removed the plastic dripper from the bottle and chugged down all of the Wortchestshire. 

“Thank you.”, it said breathlessly as though it’s thirst had been quenched. “I’ve brought you a few things”, it said. “I’m afraid I’ve left them with my coat. Could you get it?”

He went back into the refrigerator while I went to retrieve his coat. I picked it up off of the floor and out of the rolled up coat rolled my moccasins. I picked up the moccasins and his coat and went back to the kitchen.

He was holding up a jar of cocktail olives, then he removed the lid and began to chug from it. 

“Thank you for returning these”, I said. 

“That implies that I took them.”

“Uh-huh. I’m still glad you brought them.”

“You are welcome.”, it said slowly. 

It looked me up and down and for the briefest moment I saw an expression on its face. It was hard to tell what it might have been at the time; its face was so unnatural that I found it difficult to even look at, let alone read with any accuracy, but as I thought back on it over the last fifteen or so years, I think I understand what it felt when it looked at me: pity, or at least a rough approximation of it. 

“Did you happen to find... another shoe? It’s white and red. It belonged to my w-”

It raised its long hands and cut me off.

“I haven’t introduced myself. My name is Simon. Umbra.”

“Ok. I’m-”

Simon raised it’s hand again to silence me.

“You’re confused. There was no other shoe.”, it said slowly, and deliberately. It’s eyes very quickly glanced around the room. 

I knew what it was saying, and I didn’t like it; we were being observed. 

“I want her back”, I seethed, “right now.”.

Simon looked down to the floor. It kneeled and scraped some of the browned and rotting lettuce off of the floor. It held a loose handful of the desiccated salad and smelled it. Then it ate all of it. 

After it slurped down all of the nearly liquid, rotten salad mess, it licked at its fingers soundlessly.

Then its neck snapped up and it glared up at me. Its eyes flashed with a bright red light, and it burned my eyes in a quick moment as our eyes met like crossing a lens glare in a camera.

I groaned in pain and rubbed at my eyes. The bright phosphenes dissipated quickly and I saw his face back to whatever passed as normal for him. 

“You want who back?”, he... it asked. 

It’s happening again. Damn.

“I want her back, ‘Simon’.”, I said, trying to make clear that I did not believe anything he, no it, said.

“You’ll have to be more specific.”

It stepped out of the way as a marched to the refrigerator. I ran my hands across the door looking for our pictures, the ones of me, and Wylie, and... her. But they weren’t there. They were gone. 

I ran back toward the basement steps. Simon didn’t try to stop me. I barreled down them and crashed through the door to my office. 

There were large, black eyes in the dark room, a dozen or so reflecting the light that trickled down the steps from the kitchen. 

Those black eyes were set in large heads, on small and gaunt bodies that looked slick and reflective in a way that made their color hard to tell in the dim light.

One began to move toward me quickly. I stepped back toward the bottom step before its outstretched hand with it’s three long fingers, like prongs on a fork, grabbed me.  

It’s grip was strong, too strong for how small a thing it was. I tasted something metallic, and a sedate feeling took me. 

I was being pulled toward the dark corner of the room, but the room wasn’t in that corner anymore; that corner of the basement was now somewhere else. The corner of the basement was full of unnatural yellow light and surfaces that rolled and slithered at bizarre angles as if the space had been grown, rather than built. I saw metallic objects dangling from the brown darkness above me, and roiling liquid pulsing through the walls like the inside of an eyeball. 

But mostly what I saw in that space were those black and humongous eyes that held me in a gaze that I will never understand.

A loud click came from the top of the basement stairs. I turned around and saw Simon standing in the door frame. He... it... had turned on the light for the basement steps. When I turned back around into my adequately lit office there were no large, black eyes staring back at me. It was my basement office again. 

I went to the desk and frantically ripped apart the drawers looking for a picture of her, a note, something with her name on it. I found nothing.

I slumped into the chair, my arms hung limp off the sides, and I had myself a very sleepy sort of panic attack. 

“You should work,” came Simon’s very monotonous and chirping voice, “it can be a very calming endeavor.”.

I looked up at the wall above my monitor. I could feel his gaze on the back of my skull. I was angry at some level, but for some reason I couldn’t access that rage, couldn’t even really remember why I should be angry.

“You took something. You, whatever the fuck you are, and whatever the fuck happened in the woods-”

“The woods?”, asked Simon. “Whatever happened in the woods. Yes. Yes, the woods. May I make a suggestion, Arthur?”

Arthur? Was that who I am? Who I was? Is that what they were making me into, to replace what they took, and bury what they did?

“I don’t think I’ll find work all that calming.”, I hissed through clenched teeth.

“I know some have found your work calming. Finish your work, Arthur. Time is finite at this angle, and especially your time, so you don’t have forever.”

I was still staring at the wall above my monitor. I was trying to hold on to... any of it. Everything was slipping away, like I had awoken from one nightmare straight into the next nightmare. 

Flashes of that place that the corner of my room became leapt through my mind like snap shots.

“It is Arthur, you know.”, Simon said. I couldn’t tell if he... it... Simon was emphasizing its point or whether it was reassuring me that I am Arthur. 

It seemed alien to me, that name, but it had rung somehow familiar. 

I felt Simon come closer to me, like a weight moving through the room that bent my mind toward his.

Its.

I saw Simon in the reflection of the old C.R.T. monitor that I had used for work; backlit from the light coming from the basement stairs, his form was smeared across the black glass like shapes in a puddle in the rain, while everything else in the room reflected with the fidelity of normal reality. 

In that reflection on that screen in that dimly lit end of the room for the briefest of moments I am sure I saw Simon as he did not mean to be seen by me: huge, with glowing red eyes, a gaunt frame that sloped to avoid the eight foot ceiling of the office, all black like a shadow with what I could swear might have been ten or twelve foot wings growing from its back and folded in on themselves.

I blinked, and that wrong image that was laid bare to me for the shortest second was gone and replaced with the image of a shirt, grey jacket, black tie, and spindly fingers on a long hand slowly reaching past my neck.

That hand glided past me, and Simon extended his long pointer finger and pushed the power button on the monitor in front of me.

It clicked on with its familiar tinnitus pitched electric whine. I felt Simon’s other hand rest upon the back of the chair as he stood up straight.

“One might caution against repetition, Arthur. Some things lose their meaning when repeated. People too seem to lose cohesion when they repeat themselves - if ever there was such a thing as cohesion. Meaning gets lost. Some things are meant to be lost and stay lost.”

I spun around to face Simon and looked directly into those impossibly blue eyes, which were a touch too large and too far apart to engender anything close to comfort.  

His gaze was darting, like an animal studying something it didn’t need or particularly want to understand.

He spun me back around in my chair so that my eyes fell on the monitor, my previous word document still open from before, the caret still blinking at the end of the last sentence I had typed. 

“Work can be calming, Arthur. It can give one a purpose”, said Simon in his chirping drone, “...but remember what I said. You can never tell who your audience will be, or how closely they will listen.”

I glanced back over my shoulder and watched as Simon went back toward the basement stairs, his... their... its... entire frame enveloped by the light of the kitchen, which seemed to grow with a strange intensity as Simon faded within it.

I didn’t hear any patter or creak from those snare tight steps leading up to the kitchen, but I knew that whatever Simon was or perhaps still is, was gone. 

I looked back at the monitor. The same three lines I had been working on before. I remembered the phone call, the taste of pennies, the thrum, the stag, and the annihilating brightness... but only then did I remember those three sentences I had worked on before the light, and the woods, and the otherness. 

I was about to erase everything from that page right then. I highlighted everything on it, but as I was about to hit the delete key I heard familiar scratching and barking at the back door from familiar paws. 

I went to let Wylie back in, knowing that his experience would never be taken from him, whatever it had been. I was envious of the dog for that, and I still am. That experience could only be remembered by him and never told. 

Or maybe he didn’t remember it. Maybe he didn’t need to.

He nuzzled excitedly through the backdoor into the kitchen, and I got his food and water dishes from the cabinet I stowed them in when I... we... were unwilling to right Wylie off as dead.  He watched me with his head cocked, his brow raised as I set the bowls down. As soon as the bowls touched the tile he darted off down the basement, and into my office.

When I got down the stairs and back into my office I found him on the sofa, sniffing frantically at the cushions and the throw pillows. Reflexively, I cocked my head and raised my eyebrow. 

I sat at the chair once more as Wylie spun and settled in a ball in the middle of the sofa. I read the last three lines once more.

“She never existed. Don’t say her name. Don’t say her name.”

The years passed up there on our mountain, and I held on to the story as a precious and secret thing, horrified of what would happen if I spoke it aloud.  

But I’m older, and the cancer has been quietly spreading around my body in an almost mocking inverse of the violent and sudden annihilation of that unnatural light in the woods.

It doen’t matter, though. Not anymore. 

I know her name.

Rachel, I’m coming for you.

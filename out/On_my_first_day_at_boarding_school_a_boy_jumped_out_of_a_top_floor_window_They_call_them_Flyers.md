So.  

The question is: How am I going to write all of this down before they shut off the WIFI and seal my lips for good?  

First of all, I can’t reveal the name of the school—so I’ll be using a placeholder name.  

Secondly: If you EVER work out where we are, and what school this is, do not come here.  

My fate is already sealed.  

Please don’t make the same mistake as me.  

… 

… 

... 

Half an hour after my Delta flight had touched down in sunny Knoxville, I was still half asleep in the back of my Uber gagging on my own stale toothpaste breath and the cereal bar I’d forced down on the plane. It's not like I'm not used to travelling. My dad’s family lives in Korea, so I’m dragged to the other side of the world every year—even in the middle of a pandemic—and I’m more or less okay.

I don’t know what it was about this flight in particular which knocked me out so bad. The car-ride was bumpy and made me feel even more nauseous than I already was, and by the time I was dragging my luggage out of the trunk, I was ready to head to my room and nap. 

Boarding school hadn’t been my idea. I thought I’d be spending my junior year back in Canada with my friends, but my parents had other plans. I wasn’t going to complain though. According to them, this particular school had famous alumni, as well as resembling a far more modern Hogwarts. And trust me, after reading and re-reading all the Harry Potter books as a kid, this place sounded like a dream.  

I was right. Well, I was right for several precious minutes. 

It’s amazing how fast your life can change in a matter of seconds. 

My first breaths in front of Eaton Academy were excited and laboured with nerves.  

I couldn’t help marvelling at the building in front of me, all my first day jitters melting away.  

It rose from behind trees like a mountain, ominous and foreboding. Dark brick and ornate details inlaid in the cement and mortar, twisting vines crawling up the sides, like the ground itself was trying to pull it downward. It was—beautiful and haunting, and I couldn’t believe I was actually starting school at a place which looked like it had been ripped straight from a fantasy novel. The colours were eye-catching; the dark brown and reddish of the building, the sprout of green, of life from ancient rubble, and dotted colour bursting—flowers planted around the perimeter already in their summer bloom.  

The interior, however, was a mixture of old and new, a far more modern feel to it. I side-stepped away from my ride, and glimpsed sliding glass doors and an electronic panel for student ID’s. I could spend hours describing this place, and these descriptions would never come close to doing it justice. When I looked up and took in the beauty of the academy, its ancient exterior riddled with ivy and turrets sitting under a sky of deep blue, there he was, a kid maybe a little older than me, balanced on the tips of his toes, hanging out of a six-story window. 

At first, I thought I was seeing things, immediately blaming my lack of sleep, but when I tipped my head back and squinted—no—what I was seeing was definitely in the confines of reality. He was a shadow sitting under the sun, a silhouette I thought had bled from my own brain—and when I looked closer, I found myself staring at a boy. He was a little older than me, standing in front of a silk curtain blowing in the slight breeze.

The boy wore the school crest and stood with his arms stretched out, eyes closed, a giant grin splitting his mouth apart. A smile which wasn’t real. It couldn’t have been real, because this smile was crazed, twisted with insanity, something deeply, deeply wrong. Peter Pan is one of my favourite movies—or it was. 

I had always wanted to stand on the edge of my windowsill under a full moon and spread out my arms and pretend to fly, just like Peter and Wendy. But seeing it in real life, at how the boy held himself, tipping backwards and forwards like he was teasing his own descent, made me feel sick to my stomach. Fantasy and reality were two different things, I quickly came to realise. This boy wasn’t going to fly off to Neverland and fight pirates and never growing old, no—he was going to fucking die. And yet he didn’t seem to care. I've never seen an expression both empty and riddled with emotion at the same time.  

This boy was both vacant, and yet I could see his whole body vibrating with immense joy forcing him off balance. 

There was nothing behind his eyes. I searched for pain and regret, sorrow, loneliness—any emotion flickering on his face and in his eyes, a clue to what had driven him to destructive thoughts, to willingly teeter on the edge of life and death. There was nothing. I saw nothing; only ignited joy flickering in otherwise empty eyes and a manic energy rocking him backwards and forwards, primed on his toes.  His smile told me everything I needed to know. He was happy. Happy to die.  

Happy to throw himself off the edge.  

I was aware of my mouth moving, soundless words I was trying to choke out to the Uber drive, who had been helping me with my luggage. I looked away for one second, just a single breath away, to look for help—and within that single breath and the slight twist of my body I felt my body stiffen up, my mouth going dry.

The world seemed to slow down, and within that split second of me opening my mouth and crying out for help, something—something dropped out of the sky at the corner of my eye, slamming into the car’s windshield with a sickening smack. I don’t remember screaming, but my mouth was open—and I was trying to. 

I was trying to scream, but it was locked in my throat. In front of me, splayed across the fancy Honda Civic's windshield, was what was left of the boy, a head which wasn’t quite a head anymore penetrating glass, dirty blonde hair soaked in pooling scarlet and limbs bent in angles which shouldn’t have been possible. 

The explosion of red in front of me set something off inside me, but I couldn't move. I stumbled back and dropped my bag-- and then my phone which I’d forgotten I'd been holding. I meant to take a picture for my friends. The slam of the Uber door snapped me out of it, and the driver jumped out with his hands on his hips. Then he reached into his pocket and pulled out his phone.  

"We've got another flyer." He said, with a groan. Whatever was said on the other end of the line made him hiss in frustration. "Yeah. Well, come and clean him off my fucking windscreen. I'm not touching him.” His expression twisted. 

“Come on, man. This is a new car! I’ve got other clients and there’s fucking brains splattered everywhere.” 

He pocketed his phone before turning to me with a sickly smile. Then he turned to me with a smile. “You’ll get used to flyers,” The driver rubbed his chin, “Though I’ve gotta say, it’s a little early for ‘em. I expected them in September.”  

It took me a second to piece together his words in my head.  

It was obvious from his reaction to the dead boy that this-- this was their normal. This had happened before. And when that thought became a hurricane in my head, I took a single step back, my body rattling. Swallowing my breakfast which had made an unwelcome appearance in a sour bile, I tightened my grip on my luggage. “Flyers?”

I repeated the word like it was alien, like he was speaking a different fucking language. It didn’t make sense. Nothing made sense right then. I was standing in front of a modern Hogwarts, my dream school, and there was an explosion of dead boy spattered on the windshield of my ride which the driver treated like a minor inconvenience. Like it was a fucking bird, or a dead raccoon.  

“Yeah.” The driver nodded, “These kids are a little different, and you definitely need an iron stomach to survive here.” He cocked his head, regarding me with a frown. Like I was what was wrong in the picture. “What are you, a public-school kid?  

I shook my head, still in disbelief—that he wasn’t trying to help the boy. Yes, the kid was passed saving, but the driver didn’t care, only tossing glances at the body every few moments, his lip curling with disgust. The growing stain of red was growing, spread across splintered glass.

I noticed details I really shouldn’t have which was enough to build a semblance of identity, who this boy had been; a beaded bracelet attached to an olive wrist, a smiley face in marker painted on the back of a limp hand—ratty converse with discoloured laces and a worn white shirt with noticeable sweat stains under the arms. “He’s dead.” I said, and then I said it again in a choked laugh, my eyes watering.

“He’s... he’s dead.”  

The driver shrugged. “Yep. It’s going to take a while to get his brains off my goddamn windscreen.” 

The man’s words didn’t leave my head, and I stood in a daze watching several teachers take turns to scrape what was left of the boy off the car, before a woman with dark brown hair in a ponytail and a suit waved her hand in front of my face.  

“You must be Elizabeth!” The woman’s smile was bright, despite the body bag being carried behind me. She was” completely unfazed, her smile genuine, and I couldn’t understand why. Her gaze went to the clipboard in her hands. “Though it says here you like to go by Bee!” She held out her hand for me to shake, and I ignored it. I watched the body bag lifted onto a stretcher and carted away like he was nothing. “I’m Vice Principal Williamson! Welcome to Eaton!” 

Vice Principal Williamson must have seen my expression. Because I was sure I was either going to faint, start screaming, or throw up. Maybe all three. Finally, she glanced at the mess of red being power washed off the car, her lips twitching. I watched the water splash onto the ground, my stomach rising into my throat. "Ah."

She cleared her throat. "Bee, I'm sure you have been informed that we are not an ordinary school. It is very hard to enrol here, and when kids do, the majority of them can't, ah, stomach, some of our...let's say, quirks." Her eyes narrowed, and she folded her arms like she was judging me for giving a fuck. “Do you want to be here, Miss Issacs? I was impressed by the application your parents submitted.” 

Quirks? She was calling it a “Quirk”?! 

I opened my mouth to tell her to call my parents, to call another ride to get me the fuck out of there.  

And then I remembered I didn’t have a home to go back to.  

Well, I did. But my parents were away on business, and I wasn’t allowed in the house on my own. Eaton Academy was their way of making sure I was far away from home and not causing any trouble. I had to swallow a cry. “Yes.” I said in a croak. I was already planning the conversation I was going to have with my mom, and it involved her getting me the fuck away from Eaton and back home. 

Maybe I could stay with a friend, or some long distance relative I didn’t know. I was even willing to go and stay with my grandma, and that was on the other side of the world. But right then I had to say yes. I’d stay at Eaton for a night and make my escape the next morning.  “Yes.” I said again, forcing the word out of my mouth.  

The woman nodded, but she wasn’t smiling. “And can you accept that you are going to see more Flyers?”  

“Flyers?” I whispered. “What are Flyers?”  

The teacher's mouth curved. “I’m quite sure you will find that out very soon, Miss Issacs.” She pointed to the Uber where the boy had landed, “Now, this is your last chance to turn away from us and not look back. You can still leave, and I will terminate your enrollment. There is no judgement here,” Her lips formed a smile, “You are our first student who has witnessed a Flyer before even stepping foot inside the Academy. Unlike them, you know exactly what awaits you inside.”  

My mind was roaring.  

Every other student had walked through those sliding doors unaware of their so-called normal.  

Oblivious of the choice I was being given.  

I know it sounds stupid. I know I should have taken her offer and left.  

But I didn’t know where to go, and right then, Eaton was all I had.  

Unless I wanted to spend a night homeless baking in the early July Tennessee heat.  

“’I’m okay.”  

She arched her brow. “This school is not for everyone, Bee.” 

"I said I’m okay.” I couldn't resist a choked laugh. "I-- I just wasn't expecting to see... that." 

“Well, we don’t broadcast it. Everything which happens here stays within the confines of Eaton. If what you saw turned your stomach, you do not belong here. I will give you one chance. Once you follow me, you will not be able to turn back." I didn’t move, staying stubbornly still—and Mrs Williamson hummed. “Very well. Why don’t we head inside?” 

She gestured for me to follow her, catapulting into a speech of some sort. I could barely take any of it in, but I did manage to get the basic points.  “I'll show you to your room--- and then I’m sure another student can take the role of your tour guide. I am quite busy right now. It's currently summer for our students, and most of them do not go home. Classes don’t start until late August, early September, and you’re our first new arrival of the 2022/2023 school year. 

Our students wear their uniform during the summer, as well as other holidays, as there is a zero-tolerance policy for informal clothes such as jeans, or any designer wear. There is a casual version of the uniform you can wear which is better suited for out of class activities which you will see being worn right now—as we are at the peak of summer and our students are enjoying the sun.” 

As the woman spoke, she turned and marched through a stone arch which looked like it had been standing for centuries. I thought she was going to take me through the main doors to the reception area, but instead I stumbled after her to what appeared to be the school’s ridiculously large outdoor area—which was more of a field than a patch of grass. A large fountain stood in the centre; wooden tables dotted around. There were students everywhere in different variations of the school colours, shirts and ties, blazers and skirts hiked up exposing fishnet tights, pants covered in dirt from play-fighting. To my confusion, the kids at Eaton Academy seemed... normal.  

Like a boy hadn’t just thrown himself out of a six-story window.  

I saw them sitting in groups as well as twos and threes, some alone, typing on laptops, and others leaning against a tree with a book in their lap. Looking at them smiling, laughing, talking amongst each other, I couldn’t see any hint that a boy was dead. They were in their own world, and I struggled to see how they chose to turn away from something so horrific. 

Mrs Wiliamson was getting further and further away, more of a shadow under the lane afternoon sun—and I struggled to awkwardly run after her, stepping over girls sunbathing on their blazers, a group of kids engrossed in a curly haired girl playing Nintendo Switch. “Yes!” The girl punched the air with one hand, her thumbs stabbing buttons, “I finally did it!” 

“Cheater.” A kid with glasses said, only for the group of them to erupt into laughter.  

Walking faster, I almost tripped over a group of older kids sitting under the sun on a worn picnic blanket. But when I took a closer look, the first saw were only the centre ones in a large pattern-like formation spreading out across the grass—at least a dozen of them, boy’s and girl’s alike, sitting and standing around them. Unlike the ones in the middle, these kids held no expression, no smiles. 

They simply stood or sat with blank eyes. They reminded me of guards. My gaze flicked to the kids in the centre. There were six of them, and even they were sitting in formation, a pentagon; two girls, a blonde and a brunette sitting opposite each other, while two guys occupied the other spaces—and a sixth guy sitting in the middle. The way they were dressed was different to what I had seen. 

They wore blazers in the relentless heat and weren’t breaking a sweat.  These guys did have expressions. The blonde girl was smiling at her phone, showing the brunette something on the screen, while the two guys leaned over some kind of book. 

The kid sitting in the middle lay back on his elbows, his legs crossed, a dreamy smile on his lips. He wouldn’t be hard to spot in a crowd; dark red hair catching the sun, and pasty skin. I could tell just from looking at him that he oozed riches; that his parents only gave him the best, and he ruled the school, along with his inner circle.  

“Hey! 

I didn’t realise I had come to a sudden stop, when I saw another boy coming towards the group.  

He moved like a freight train, uncaring that he was stamping on someone’s lunch, or tripping over a couple making out behind a chemistry textbook. I watched the boy get closer, and with every step he radiated an almost terrifying energy, teeth gritted, eyes wide. Ignoring others around the larger formation starting to come alive and move to stop him, he shoved past them, until he’d reached the inner circle—grabbing the redheaded boy by the scruff of his shirt and forcing him to his feet. “What did you do?”  

The boy’s voice was strained, and up close I saw his eyes were glistening. When the redhead only regarded him with a lazy smile, he slammed the knuckles of his fist into the kid’s face. Though he didn’t even make a mark. 

“Daniel!” He choked out,” You fucking killed him!”  

The blonde girl started to stand up, her eyes darkening, but the redhead held up his hand, stopping her.  

“Stand down, Pia.” He murmured, “I’ll deal with this.” 

The blonde slumped back to her knees. The more I looked at her, she resembled a china doll more than a girl.  

The redhead turned his attention back to his attacker. He jutted his chin, lips twisting in disgust. "You know, I was really enjoying my lunch-- and now I've got to go and throw it all back up again because once again, you've ruined my vibes and turned the air toxic." He pouted. "What a shame." He shoved the boy back. "I'd watch what you're doing, by the way.” 

“He’s right.” One of the boy’s in the middle whistled—a British accent. “You’re getting too close, mate.” 

I expected the kid to attack the redhead again, but to my confusion, he stood down, taking three shaky steps back.  

He blinked rapidly like he was coming out of a trance and looked around to see himself standing in the middle of their formation.  “Daniel.” The boy said again, like a plea. He sniffled, swiping his eyes with the sleeve of his jacket, “What did you do to him?”  

“Daniel?” The redhead pretended to think, “Who’s Daniel again?”  

His friend’s started to laugh, and then others, their laughter spreading out across their giant human pentagon.  

“Sam.” The guy turned to the British guy, “What the fuck are you doing? Wake up! Daniel! He’s–”

“He flew.” The redhead cut him off,  his smile stretched across his face, "Yeah, we get it. Real sad.”

The kid’s expression crumpled, but he didn’t lunge. “You son of a--” 

“Bee!” Mrs Williamson’s voice shattered their argument, and I turned to find the teacher striding back over.  

“What are you doing?” She yelled, pointedly ignoring the others. “I told you to follow me.”  

I did, forcing my legs to walk, but I kept turning back, waiting for the boy to speak.  But he didn't. He just stood there.  

Seething. 

Mrs Williamson didn’t stay with me for long. She told me where my room was, which was on the top floor, shoved me into the elevator with a bright smile—and told me that she was happy I’d chosen to stay. When the elevator pinged on the top floor, I found my room—room 1785. I was out of breath, lugging my luggage in front of a large wooden door and reaching out for the handle, when I noticed it was wet. Not just wet. The palm of my hand was sticky and warm when I lurched back. 

I knew what it was automatically. It was blood.  

Not human blood. It was thicker and it looked like it had been mixed with something to appear brighter.  

Swiping my hands on my dress, I shoved the door open and pulled my stuff with me. I found myself in a room with two beds, two desks, and two closets, as well as an en-suite built into a small cove in the corner. The side of the room which was occupied was bursting with colour, an explosion of books and clothes, and plushies. I glimpsed boybands I didn’t know the name of plastered on the walls, a rainbow bedspread and a MacBook sitting on the desk surrounded by coffee cups and dogeared paperbacks. 

Taking another hesitant step, my gaze automatically went to the window, which was wide open, mini cacti sitting on the sill—and then the far wall, which was covered in meal plans, different calendars, and an exercise chart covered in smiley faces and “You can do it!” sticky notes.

I was frowning at a diet plan which looked like it had been meticulously planned out, when I heard it—sobbing. There was someone in the bathroom. Slowly, I edged towards the door which was slightly open—and through the gap I saw a girl on her knees on pristine marble, her legs drawn to her chest. She was bent over, curly dark hair hanging in closed eyes.

Unlike the kids outside, the girl wore the school crest casually over shorts and t-shirt. She was clutching something in trembling hands resting in her lap. I peered closer. A small red envelope. There was a Starbucks cup next to her, its lime green contents pooling around her. From the look of the way he was positioned, it looked like she’d dropped it. "Hey." I said softly, knocking three times on the door. 

“Is this—uh, is this room 1785?” 

The girl jerked like she’d been shocked and lifted her head, blinking at me rapidly. 

She was pretty with wide eyes and freckles, curly black hair framing a heart shaped face. She had been crying, judging from her smeared eyeliner and her attempt to hide her tears. "Oh, hello!" the girl swiped at her eyes, sniffling. "Bee, right? Yeah, they told me you were coming." She stretched her arms out. "Welcome to Eaton Academy! What are you, my third roommate?” The girl’s laugh was choked. 

She grabbed the envelope and tore it up before holding out a hand, which was smudged red. From the door handle, I thought. The girl’s smile was bright, but it was fake. There were tears in her eyes she was failing to hide, her trembling fists at her sides. “I’m Sunny!” 

She seemed to say everything with expletives, her smile widening with every word. “I’m sure we’ll be great friends! For the next day, that is. But oh well!” 

Sunny pointed to the side of the room with no personality, and a plain bed. “That’s yours.” The girl started to pace the room,  her hands clawing at her hair. “It was Cassie’s, and then Mara’s, then Tally’s. But they all flew away.” I jumped when Sunny came to stand in front of me, her eyes still bright with mania. “Literally!” She pointed to the open window with a laugh. “All of them flew!”

I dumped my bag hesitantly and sat on the bed watching Sunny pace back and forth. 

It was like I was watching the five stages of grief at once. 

She was smiling, and then her smile was crumpling, twisting into a grimace, before settling into a wide grin. 

“Of course it would be now.” Sunny grasped at her hair like claws. She was talking at a pace which was almost impressive. “Because… because why wouldn’t it be, huh? I have decent grades, I'm actually making friends and joining clubs, and I’m even forcing myself to eat healthily.” She flung out her arm, gesturing to the wall. “Do you know how hard it is to eat three salad leaves a day?” 

Sunny scoffed. “I found the cleanse on Google, and it told me I’d be feeling great after a while, but all I’m feeling is hungry. Hungry! I don’t feel like a new person, I just feel ravenous because guess what? Three salad leaves is not sustainable.

Human beings can’t live on three goddamn salad leaves. What, do they think we’re squirrels?” Sunny came close to me, right in my face. “I’m not a squirrel.” The girl hissed, “And I refuse to eat like one!” She stuck her finger in her mouth, “See!” she said, “See, look! We have teeth! We have teeth to tear into meat, and this stupid cleansing diet wanted me to eat THREE salad leaves a day, and some weird looking Starbucks which looks like Plankton got put in a blender?”

Sunny dropped to her knees with a sob, nestling her head in her lap. “I was so close.” She whispered, “Mr Mayer told me I could sing. He told me he could get connections, and I really thought… I thought I was finally going to get out of here…”

She trailed off with a breath. “Maybe I could run away,” she scoffed. “I’m sure that hasn’t been tried before.”

I thought back to the boy who had jumped out of the window, and the Vice Principal’s words. 

Of course kids would want to get the fuck out of there after seeing something like that. 

“Run away?” I finally managed to speak, “Is this about–”

Sunny held up her hand smudged red. “I’m marked,” she mumbled into her lap, “For those bastards.” She wrapped her arms around her legs, “I come back from lunch with this really cute girl, and what do I find? That I’m marked for death.”

Sunny went quiet for a moment before looking up, her eyes glittering. “Do you drink?”

“Drink?”

“Yeah.” Her voice was soft, “I can drink, right? I’ll get wasted on whatever expensive crap they drink, and kiss a beautiful stranger, and then I won’t feel it, right?”

“Don’t be dramatic.” 

I turned to the new voice, and it was familiar. 

The kid from earlier who had lunged at the red headed kid was leaning against the doorframe. Now that he was up close, I saw his profile; a mop of light brown hair with narrow features, almost like his whole face was pinched. The boy seemed calmer than earlier, though there was a certain gleam in his eyes I saw in Sunny’s.

Like her, he was close to breaking. I could see it in the way he moved, like he was ready for a fight. He held out his hand, frowning at sharp smears of red, and then bending down to frown at the orange door handle. “Pigs blood.” The boy murmured, “Well, I’ve got to give it to them– they may be psychopaths but at least they’re creative. I was expecting a horse’s head on your bed, but pigs blood works too.”

He shot a smile at Sunny. “No matter what you do, your life will never be a chick-flick.”

“I can dream.” The girl ducked her head again. 

“You’re not going to die,” He said, “So stop being dramatic. You’ve got plenty of time to kiss beautiful strangers.”

“Go away.” Sunny didn’t look up, sniffling. “You’re not using me as a test subject, so stop with the sweet talk.”

“I didn’t ask.”  The boy stepped into the room, his attention going to the screwed up red envelope on the floor. 

He picked it up, his smile fading. 

“Dearest Sunny Delacroux.”

“Don’t read it out!” 

The guy continued, mocking a British accent. “Dearest Sunny Delacroix, you are invited to join our annual Dance Of The dead–” He rolled his eyes, “Not ominous at all.” He went back to reading, “The party will be held tomorrow night at midnight. Wear something pretty. Impress us and join our heart, fail us, and fly. We’re looking forward to meeting you, blah, blah, blah– and just when I thought they couldn’t get any more pretentious they added a George Orwell reference.”

“What?” Sunny still didn’t lift her head. 

"Their meeting place." He said, "Room 101.”

Sunny just snorted. 

The guy sighed, his eyes going back to the invite. “Yours sincerely,” He screwed up the invite with a hiss, “Lux.”

He turned to Sunny, his eyes darkening, “You’re all kinds of screwed.” 

Finally, the girl looked up, scowling. “Real words of encouragement there.”

“Lux.” I said out loud, “What is that?” 

Sunny only offered me a shrug, and the guy’s gaze lazily found me. 

“Huh.” He cocked his head, “You’re the new girl who witnessed my breakdown earlier.” The boy shot me a sickly smile. 

“Sup. I’m Freddie.” 

“What?” Sunny rested her chin on her knee, “Wait, what breakdown?” 

Freddie ran his hands through his hair. “I almost kicked the shit out of Nicholas Mourde earlier.” He shrugged. “No big deal.”

Sunny went pale. “You threatened Lux?” 

“Yeah.” Freddie sat back on the bed, his smile tensing. “They took Pia, Sam, Lili, and now Daniel. What do you expect me to do?” 

“Um, not antagonise them? They already know your plan. Why do you think they took Daniel?”

“We don’t know that.” Freddie said stiffly, “Daniel was smart. He was one of the smartest kids in our year. It doesn’t make sense that they would make him a Flyer.”

Daniel, I thought dizzily. 

The boy who I'd seen drop out of the sky finally had a name. 

I cut into their back and forth. “What is Lux?” 

Freddie lay back on the bed, letting out an exaggerated sigh. "Lux.” He shot me a look. “You know the stories which swear there's a secret society in every elite school and university? Well, they're correct." He grabbed a pillow and stuffed his face into the material, his words muffling, “Introducing Lux, your worst nightmare, and this school’s worst kept secret, especially when we get Flyers every month. Lux is a group of sociopaths led by the son’s and daughter’s of this school’s administration. They were bored one day, so they thought, hey, why don’t we start fucking with the kids below us?”

Freddie threw the cushion at the wall, “And thus, Lux was born, and has been terrorising Eaton since before the First World War. When they choose you, they mark you two nights before their annual party– and depending on how you act that night, they will make the decision whether you join their circle, become a mindless guard or servant, and my personal favourite–”

“Flyer.” I was speaking before he could say it. I swallowed hard, “But the teachers! Why don’t they stop it?”

“They can’t.” Freddie said. “Either that, or they don’t want to. This whole place is a fucking slaughterhouse. I’ve been here since I was thirteen, and I still can’t get down there no matter what I do. They’ve got that place locked down. They treat us like game pieces." He scoffed.

"They'll knock us over without a second thought-- but sometimes they continue to drag us across the board, which is worse than killing us. It's making us wait. giving us hope. Before they reveal their signature move." He looked up hopefully at Sunny, “Or Sunny could help me get down there and stop those bastards for good.” 

“Stop them?” Sunny laughed, “You mean give them another reason to make you a Flyer.”

“If i can get down there I can stop them.” Freddie said, “I just need you to get me in.” 

“What makes you think you can stop them?” 

Freddie didn’t reply, and I realised from his expression– he had no idea. 

“Come on, Sunny.” He said, “Do you want to end up like–”

"Like Daniel." Sunny cut him off, "And Lydia, and Tally, and all the other Flyers."

“No.” She glared at the boy. To my surprise, she jumped up, strode over to her desk and brought up Spotify on her laptop, playing a song– It was upbeat and the girl started to dance. Well, it could have been dancing, though all I was watching was manic flailing to the beat. Sunny danced like nobody was watching her, whipping her head back and forth, her hair flying in a whirlwind. 

She shuffled over to Freddie in jerking movements I couldn’t help smiling at. When he only shook his head, a smile pricking on his lips, she pouted. “Maybe Sunny doesnt want to help.” She said, panting. “Maybe Sunny is tired of hoping to get off here, and is waiting for them to get it over with? Maybe I want to join Lux! What else is there?”

Freddie arched a brow. “Not being a mindless minion for the rest of your life or diving out of your bedroom window?”

“Have you forgotten what happens to chosen ones?” 

“So?” Freddie sat up. “I’ll follow you down there and pretend to be an acolyte. I’ll be right behind you, and unlike Daniel, I won’t lose you.” 

“Acolyte?” I hissed. 

He nodded. “Acolyte– known as a follower, servant, slave. Here at Eaton, we use the word to describe Lux’s victims who walk into that place like sheep.” 

“Exactly.” Sunny said, “We both know what happens to people they choose– so I won’t be much help.” 

“You go into a weird trance.” Freddie nodded, “I can pretend to be a mindless minion too.” 

Her lips curved into a smile. “You? You think you can stride into that place with a poker face?”

“I can pull off no emotion.” 

Sunny grabbed a plushie and threw it in his face. “You couldn’t even shut up through Endgame.” 

I stood up– my head was spinning. “So what you’re saying is the rich kids at this school are killing you for fun?” I could feel myself getting more hysterical. "What happens when these kids graduate?" 

Sunny leaned back. "We don't know."

“Yep.” Freddie said, “Welcome to Eaton. Where you're either a Flyer, a mindless minion, or on borrowed time."

The two of them argued for a while, and Freddie left, promising to be back in the morning.Sunny went into the bathroom and didn’t come back out until I was lying in bed, replaying Daniel’s fall over and over and over again in my head. I was on the edge of slumber when Sunny climbed into bed, still sobbing into her pillows. I don’t remember falling asleep, but somehow I managed to– and a noise woke me up in the middle of the night. 

The sound of the door creaking open. Immediately, I turned over in bed, but when I opened my mouth to speak, to cry out to my roommate, I found I couldn’t move. I couldn’t speak, my voice stuck in the back of my throat. I watched them circle her; six shadows in formation around her bed. I recognised the redhead, as well as another face bleeding into the flickering light of an orange flame. I knew his face, but an identity or a name wouldn’t surface in my head. They stayed with Sunny the whole night, unmoving, not speaking or making any noise. 

They just stool over, watching her. When light bled through the window showing the first signs of morning, they left– and I could move again. But I was so tired from the adrenaline I passed out soon after. 

This morning was weird. Sunny is acting like herself, but when I look at her, she seems… different.  She was in the bathroom for a while this morning, and when she left our room to speak to Freddie’s, I found blood in the faucet. 

Not just blood. 

Teeth. 

Clumps of her hair. 

Not just that. I realised who I saw last night. 

It was the kid who jumped out of the window– Daniel. 

But he’s dead. 

How could he have been in my room? 

It’s currently nearly 3pm. Freddie wants to go with his plan tonight, and Sunny has reluctantly agreed. 

I don’t even know if this is going to get out there– considering my phone calls to my parents have both been disconnected, but if it does, please wish us luck. I’m going to try and update you with what happens to Sunny and Freddie. 

I have a feeling the plan is going to go horribly wrong.

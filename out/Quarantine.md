"THIS IS IT!" "THIS IS THE END OF IT!" I screamed in this god-forsaken apartment. Immediately following my outburst, there were three strong but hollow noises on my wall: "**BAM BAM BAM**" someone knocked...

\-"Would you stop the Goddamn yelling?!" - said a deep manly voice. 

That was Mike, my next-door neighbor. I first saw him in the laundry room. He was about 5,2 feet tall, had an enormous belly, and was balding. He was wearing a dorky superhero facemask and had some black and white hairs popping out of it. He probably had a ridiculous mustache hiding under it. You could picture him as a lousy Santa Claus actor at a budget mall. I also remember a dirt stain on the left pocket of his shirt and an untied left shoe. He disgusted me to the point I couldn’t make eye contact with him.

This had been a long time coming. What a horrible scenario I found myself in. My life was over. "EVERYTHING IS OVER!" – I yelled against a pillow, I knew that I must keep quiet or the bald man with the dirt stain on his shirt would hit the wall again. I was nervous, restless, and anxious. I started laughing out of nowhere. I’ve been doing that the past few months, no matter what I did. My psychiatrist called it a tic disorder, but I called it a curse. My mother paid for 10 sessions with her, but I only did six. They never worked; it was as if my brain froze every time we spoke. I just couldn't stop thinking about Mike's dirt stain on his shirt and that untied left shoe. I didn't trust my therapist either. There was something about the way she looked at me through the webcam that was unsettling. I never told her about Mike, but I think she knew…She knew that I wanted to break inside his apartment and burn his dirty clothes. Perhaps even burn him until he was nothing but ash. She also was a "filthy one" as I call them. Her annoying glasses were always dirty on the left side. THE LEFT SIDE! It was not only annoying but truly exasperating, OUTRAGEOUS, UNACCEPTABLE. – The memory itself made me nauseous. How could I trust a filthy one, she was exactly like Mike! She wanted me to leave the apartment as the quarantine was ending, "To socialize, recover my life". She spoke. But how could I? Just the thought of mingling with other unclean people made me want to scream. But it seemed I had no choice.

I wanted to cry but I knew I couldn't make a sound. I yelled inside my head as hard as I could. My hands formed fists so tight that my nails dug into my skin. I gritted my teeth so hard you could hear them grinding. My face was red and felt as if it was next to implode, and I closed my eyes as if light could never reach them again. But despite my efforts, I heard the reminder that I wasn't alone: "**BAM BAM BAM**" 

– "Quit it already blondie or I am going to come over there!".

I panicked. Were my thoughts so loud that Mike could hear them? If so, did he know I wanted to burn his shirts, his left un-tied shoe, his apartment, and even his body? I felt trapped, I couldn't talk, I couldn't think, I COULDN'T BREATHE. It was suffocating. My heart was racing. It felt like I was dying. I was out of whiskey that used to calm me down. The only thing left; was the mysterious yellow pill the dirty glass lady gave me. My last resort. Before I took it, I thought: "*Was she able to listen to my thoughts as well?*".

**Pill time** – My heart went into hibernation. My breathing stopped. I felt cold. The infinite thoughts that were leading me to the verge of madness abruptly disappeared. If this meant I was dying, I probably wouldn’t care at all. If this pill was poison, at least my executioner was merciful.

It took me some time to recover. I was probably laying down on the floor for hours. I was disoriented. My curtains were always closed so I could never really tell the time of the day. The whole apartment felt empty...or perhaps, I was the empty one. The pill was like a remote control that muted the thoughts in my head. I rested sure that no neighbor or psychiatrist could hear them now. I was safe, for now. Even the memory of that un-tied shoe didn't bother me much. After all, the only one that I could trust was Charlotte. 

"Psss, Psss" I whispered. "Hello, Charlotte! How are you doing sweetie, say hi to mommy".

Charlotte was an elegant Siamese cat with big bright blue eyes and a red ribbon around her neck. Extremely clean and distrustful. My kind of cat. One could say she even had airs of grandeur, like those cats who were worshiped by Egyptians. As I woke her, she slowly opened her eyes, brightening the whole space with her glance. She stretched, gave me a pedantic look, and said with an English accent: 

\-"I beg your pardon miss! But I believe I was separated from my mother when I was a kitten".

I panicked and jumped backward, fell, and even hit my head in surprise. "*Charlotte...Charlotte is speaking*". I almost yelled again but I clapped my hand over my mouth, still, it was inevitable. When Charlotte asked me if I was okay, I busted into laughter again:

I laughed so hard that the knocking returned: "**BAM BAM BAM BAM**". This time Mike knocked the wall 4 times, stronger than before, and continued with a menacing: -"You are going to regret the day you were born!".

The threat of Mike was nothing in the face of the talking cat crisis. I put my face in my hands and started mumbling: "What is happening to me?" "How is Charlotte speaking?". As I spoke, she approached me and said: 

\-"Oh, my dear, I am just a cat! However, it is obvious that you finally lost it! Why else would you be talking to me?". 

I was speechless, All I could do was sit down next to Charlotte and start petting her. 

\-"It's been a year since you’ve been outside this building. Just a thought but perhaps you should get out as soon as possible. That Mike fellow doesn't seem so nice either. You are running out of time." Her words turned the blood in my veins to ice.

Easier said than done. The mere thought of crossing that threshold triggered me again. That feeling was as if my head was made of ice. My tongue felt numb. I was drenched in a cold sweat. My heart started racing again, It was as if it wanted to get out of my body, RUN AWAY. But I just stood there, in front of my door, I could feel Charlotte watching me behind my back while licking her paw, indifferent to my fate. I put my face mask on. My hands were trembling and sweaty. I put my hand on the doorknob and slowly opened it with my eyes closed…

**Running** \- I ran through the doorway, the dark hall. I flew down 2 floors and finally reached the outside of the building. It was freezing, I had forgotten my coat in the process to escape. Still, I was there, alive and among other people in the street! An old man passed me by and said “Hello”. I probably was still under the effects of the pill I took because the oil stain on his trousers didn't bother me. It felt like I could tolerate the filthy ones. Perhaps it wasn't too late for me. Perhaps I wasn't crazy after all. Charlotte was wrong! I had to prove her wrong!.

As I walked down the street, I approached a newspaper stand. There I saw some disturbing but hopeful news:

**-REPORTS OF PEOPLE TALKING WITH CATS FOUND TO BE A TEMPORARY SIDE EFFECT OF THE COVID VACCINE-**

"*Could it be?*" As soon as I read it, I started running toward my apartment with a smile. *"I must tell Charlotte; I must tell her I wasn't crazy after all.*" Once inside, the hall seemed more illuminated than before. The colors seemed brighter. But I quickly realized something was off… My feelings started to change as I got closer and closer to my floor. The anxiety hit again. The sweating. The shortness of breath. And the memory of that damned un-tied shoe. Like a drum, the sound of someone knocking the wall felt stronger the closer I got. "**BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM**" It didn't stop, it just got stronger. LOUDER. As if they were knocking directly into my head. That's when I opened my door and laughed…I remembered that **I had never owned a cat.**

I fell to my knees with this awful realization. The knocking stopped, and a man dressed in a white uniform came. He was about 160 cm, had an enormous belly, and was balding. His name was on a front shirt pocket with a dirt stain. It read: “**Nurse Mike”**. He gave me a malicious smile while holding a huge syringe in his hand. -"I've been warning you all day Miss Charlotte, you just wouldn't listen. Doctor's orders!” As he spoke, he stabbed me with the needle. 

But everything was okay. As I started to get drowsy, I laughed with satisfaction as the scent of fire started to fill the whole room. It would all be ash soon.

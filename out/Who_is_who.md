Who is in my house?

Recently my mother had passed away due to her murder that was still under investigation. I got to plan the funeral, I decided for it to take place in New jersey sense that was where she was born.

At the funeral, everyone comforted me as i placed the rose in her casket. They lowered her down and began to bury her. I wiped my tears and just watched. once they were done i set some flowers beside her grave. On my way home i stopped my a gas station to get some snack for the rest of the way home. when i went to buy the food no one was there. i then realized no other cars were even there. i called out but eventually gave up and just left with the snacks.

Once i returned home i opened the door to see my mom. she was standing in the kitchen making food, she saw me and smiled. I stared at her in shock. “Honey, are you ok?” she asked me. I ran to my room and slammed the door.  what the hell was happening? i decided to sleep it off after convincing myself it was just my brain playing games to make me believe she was still alive.  In the morning i slowly crept out of my room. yet again, she was in the kitchen. “Good morning!!! breakfast is almost ready!” my “mom” cheerfully shouted. the weirdest thing besides the fact i saw my mom get buried was that, this isnt even close to being mom. She looked and sounded like my mom but is definitely not my mom. My mom cant cook. my mom is NOT an early bird. My mom is nice. my mom is an evil lady. thats why i killed her. who is this woman in my house? why does she look exactly like my mom? why is she trying to be my mom? who is she.

It has been a few days since then, she is gone now everything is back to how it should have been. i just dont know what to do with my second mom, how am i supposed to explain this? the bitch is starting to smell up my whole house. I decided to take a DNA test to see who this god damn woman is.

Its been a few days and the results are back. i still can fucking get over this. it doesn’t make sense. It has my mothers name but.. it says she doesn’t have any kids. If she doesn’t have any kids then. who the hell am i? and who was my ‘Mother’ and why was the real woman in my house? and how did she know my mom died and that she stole her identity?

Who Am I?

I cant take this anymore. how am i supposed to live without even knowing who i am?? all the DNA tests ive taken come out as inconclusive. Everyone i go to can figure it out through thumb prints, blood, or hair. that women is still smelling worse and worse. now i know i cant get caught.

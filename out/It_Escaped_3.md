It has been a couple days since I've last been able to keep a DTL. I've been sleeping the past couple days. I woke up to the sound of a voice requesting for me to head back to the administrative offices. I got out of bed, got dressed and went on over to the administrative offices. I looked out the window and almost forgot I was even in space.

The door opens, and I'm welcomed by the same voice requesting me to come over.

"Welcome back, I'm sure you've got some good rest?" the man asks, slightly hinting to my bedhead.

I laugh a bit before we moved on.

"Enough of the small talk now, I want to show you something." He pulls out a monitor and switches to a camera feed, "This, what you see here on this monitor, is currently live footage from the planet. This entity you've spoken of to us the other day has been spotted roaming around this area. Do you recognise anything... familiar about this area?" he asks, in a deep, strong voice.

"Err.. no, not really. Nothing rings a bell about the area." I respond, slightly nervous.

"Alright, how's this then? Do you see anything now?" the man says as he zooms in on the feed, showing a severely destroyed building.

"Ahh, yes sir. I remember that building. I worked there, researching on that entity just a couple hours before it managed to escape."

"Mhm, did you forget to lock it's chamber before you finished your testing?"

"I.. I'm pretty sure I did. I double and triple-checked everything before I left for my lunch break."

The mans voice got more serious, more... menacing.

"You left it unlocked. You unleashed this monstrosity upon the world. You doomed humanity as we know it!"

He snaps, and in an instant a group of ATF soldiers come in and grasp me by my arms. I tried to resist and reason, but they wouldn't let go.

"Take him away, dispose of him if possible." orders the man.

"W-wait!" I scream, in a desperate, sad tone.

"I had the on-site security place cameras in last month so we could log our research with video backup, surely there's something there."

The man sighs and looks at the camera footage.

"Alright then, look here. Do you know who this is?"

I look at the camera feed, then my eyes widen. There's no way, how could it have been? My eyes tear up as I realise.

"Y-yes! I know that man, he's Sjōn, he was a medical professional at our facility. I can't believe it... how could he have done this to us?"

"Very well, since you know him, you must go back down to that hell and take him back up here, dead or alive. Your choice. I'll send 2 ATF full forces with you to protect you. Go, now."

I try to utter out some words but fail to do so as the ATF soldiers grasping me by my arms drag me into a pod where we are sent back down. I tried to tell him Sjōn had died, but I ran out of time. I could only hope we are able to defeat this deadly entity before it defeats us. End of DTL #3.

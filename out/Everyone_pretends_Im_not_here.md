Me (M) 23 and my girlfriend (F) 22 have had a good relationship so far but I think I may have messed up. We have been staying at my parents house for the past couple of days. Sense we got here she has pretended I’m not here. My family are in on it, same with my friends. They pretend I’m not here. I’ve bumped into them, yelled at them, called them on my phone. I’ve done everything and they still ignore me so I’ve decided I’m going to ignore them. 

Day one. Nothing has changed much. They have been crying about how I’ve gone missing and it’s getting annoying. They haven’t kept leftovers. They always eat everything even though they never did before. I made myself eggs, toast and bacon.

Day two. I’ve been walking around the house less. I’ve just been using my phone. My mom was whispering to my sister about something. I heard her say something about me and why I’m acting like this, I think. The kids have been playing a game called Charlie Charlie to try and talk to me. The adults put the kids to bed then used a ouija board to try and talk to me.

Day three. Bob (my girlfriends brother) got here with his fiancé. They brought pizza, I’m going to steal some. 

Day four. I think they’ve been doing this for too long. It’s been four days. Maybe one of my friends will respond to me? I’ll check tomorrow. Bob is happy I’m not here which is  making me mad but it’s fine, I think he’s just teasing me. I’m hearing things and I think it’s because no one has talked to me.

Day five. My friends have not replied. I think I’m going crazy no one has talked to me in five days. I’m hearing things, bad things but I’m not going to do what it wants me to do. I’m also seeing things like demons, or ghosts, just something. 

Day six. I need help. I’m hearing things and everyone doesn’t care. I think they don’t see me. The things are telling me to do worse than yesterday. I’m going to try and have dinner with everyone even if that don’t see me. 

Day seven. It’s been a week and I’m done with them. I’m going to do something, I don’t know what but I’m going to do something. 

Day eight. I’m doing something today. We are all having dinner. They are still ignoring me. Bob just said my girlfriend should have broken up with me. That just broke me. They are making me go insane and mocking/bullying. I did it. I stabbed Bob. Everyone is yelling at me. They made me do this. My dad held me down so I couldn’t run. They called the police and the ambulance. The police and ambulance came in a couple minutes. I’m currently in the cop car going to jail. I don’t know why they didn’t cuff me. I could just run away.

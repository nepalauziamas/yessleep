(TW: Normalized discussion of violence and murder.)

"Is what I do evil though? I mean, really. Is it?"

Dr. Carla looked up from her notepad. "You kill people, Steven. A lot of peop-"

"Yes but people die all the time, don't they. Quite a lot from things that other people do. It doesn't make people dying evil, really, just because another person causes it, does it?"

Dr. Carla put her notepad down on her lap and held up her pen. I'd interrupted her and while she didn't mind, she did finish her sentence. "A lot of people consider deliberately ending someone's life to be one of the most evil things a person can do."

I shook my head. "No, no, no it's not. Not even close." I sat up straighter in my chair and pointed towards the door and down the hall. "What some of those other guys have done to women, children... THAT'S a lot more evil than anything I've ever thought of doing."

Dr. Carla nodded and tapped her pen against her chin. She did it a lot while she was thinking. "Ok, valid point. I won't argue it. But," she leaned forward a bit and moved her pen down flat against her notebook, "WHY do you kill, Steven? A straight answer this time, please."

I leaned back in my chair. She'd asked almost every visit before but I never gave her an answer. I usually just sat quietly until she asked a different question.

But this time I leaned a little forward, looked her in the eyes and said, "To do something. To do something real."

Dr. Carla's eyes went wide and she leaned back as I spoke. She hadn't expected an answer and I had her off guard.

I continued. "So many people do things every day. They get out of bed, go to work or school, they learn, they make things, they think. All kinds of things they do that they think have meaning. But in the end of it all, does it? Does anything anyone does really have meaning? No, not really. It might seem that way but it's all a story we make up to feel better about living meaningless lives."

I shifted in my chair, putting my left foot up on the rung and my left hand on my knee. I leaned forward and pointed at her, staring directly into her eyes. "But you can believe that when I take someone's life, it means something. The world changes in a way that no one can fix. No one can take that life back from me and do anything with it. It's real."

Dr. Carla sat frozen for a moment, staring at me, then dropped her eyes to the notepad. When she did I stopped pointing and sat back with my arms crossed.

After composing herself Dr. Carla looked back up at me and held up her pen. She tapped the air with it as she spoke.

"That doesn't excuse what you do, Steven. And it could still be considered 'evil' by a majority of people." I suddenly noticed that her air-tapping was in time with each syllable. "Think of it this way: if you hadn't killed those people then they would have led longer lives and done more things. Maybe to you the things they do are meaningless but to the world you may have taken away someone who holds a great place in the lives of many other people."

I held up my right index finger. "Ah, but, doesn't everyone die when it's 'their time' to die? I've heard that a lot, at a funeral, someone says it must have been "their time" to die. So maybe I'm really a part of the plan? Right? OR, and hear me out, if there is no plan, and things in this world really do happen without any reason, then nothing is ever really good or evil. Maybe things just, are."

Dr. Carla brought the pen back up to her chin, thinking. She nodded a little as she said, "Ok, you might have me there. If it's their time, and you're the cause, then how can we really say it's evil? Or, as you say, if there is no plan because things just happen, then how do we determine good or evil. But," she pointed her pen at me again, "at the same time you use violence to take away something that someone else doesn't want to give. And you inflict pain and suffering on others. AND you do it on purpose. That describes evil to a lot of people."

I nodded, uncrossed my arms and leaned forward with my hands on my knees. "But I don't let anyone suffer. I try to make sure it's over as quick and clean as possible. The broken necks, the stabbed hearts, the bullets, everything I've done was as quick and-"

"HOW you did it is not the point." Dr. Carla's voice was sharp as it cut me off. "While you might claim to be merciful in your methods, you're still talking about murder. Those people are still dead."

Before I could speak again a loud beeping started up. Dr. Carla reached into her pocket and pulled out her phone. "Dammit." She turned off the alarm and looked across at me, annoyed. "I'm sorry, Steven. I want nothing more than to continue our conversation but I'm due in court in an hour." She put her phone back in her pocket and started putting her other things in her bag. "If it's ok with you I would like to try and come back either later today or early tomorrow." She stood up and stepped closer for a moment. "If you say you'll talk to me I can set it up through your lawyer. I really would like to talk some more very soon."

I stood up and nodded. "I have nothing else to do, Doctor, and will talk with you again any time. But next time do you think you would consider joining me on this side of things?" I tapped the thick plexiglass wall between us. "It would make talking a lot more comfortable and I think it might make it easier for me to open up about things."

Dr. Carla laughed a little as she shook her head. "Now Steven, I hope you respect my intelligence enough to know that's not going to happen. I know how strong and fast you are and I've been told by the staff here how much you excercise in there. It's impressive and I don't feel like checking to see if my number's up anytime soon. At least, not if I can help it."

I stepped back away from the plexiglass and clasped my hands together in front of me, smiling with real joy. "That's one of the reason's I really do like you, Doctor Carla. You are so very, very smart."

I raised my right hand and waved as she stepped back towards the door. "See you again soon!"

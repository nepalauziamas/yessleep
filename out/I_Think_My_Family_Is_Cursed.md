This happened to my grandparents in one of the first houses they had moved into. Way before I was born and my mom was in my grandmothers belly my grandparents moved into one of those nice neighborhoods where the houses aren't too close and you have some sort of big back yard. My grandmother at the time had really bad insomnia because of her pregnancy. She would wake in the middle of the night and eat something or drink something.

One night when she was doing this she saw what looked like a huge bonfire in the woods near their house. It wasn't on their property so she wasn't really concerned about it. It was around one or two in the morning and she just thought it was a group of teenagers having a party and she went back to bed. The next morning she had my grandfather go check it out just to make sure that they didn't cause any damage. When he went to check it out he found hex bags and trash bags with dead animal parts and he said the whole area smelled like a burnt carcass. The fires were a frequent thing and after a while they progressed into loud noises that sounded like screaming and yelling.

One night she woke up because of how loud they were being around 10. She ended up waking up my grandfather and he ended up calling the police. This is were it escalates

A week later my grandfather found a snake with it's head chopped off and it's body split open on their mail box. A few other weird things would happen the first being my grandmother would be sick for a few days out of the blue. I'm not talking morning sickness I'm talking huge migraine, vomiting, can't move or do anything and it was just out of nowhere. At first she thought it was just the pregnancy but wouldn't this be happening the whole pregnancy? after about the third or fourth time it happened in two months she went to the doctor to get examined just to be sure that my mother was fine. He said it was common for things like that happen during a regency but what was worrying him most was how severe and how frequent the sickness was. This continued on until they eventually moved out of that house.

Another weird thing that happened was one morning my grandmother was talking to her neighbors across the street and she was asking them about the people back in the woods. They said yeah they do that often and they had tried to call the police a few times but nothing really comes of it. They never get scared off or anything like that. they always come back. As she was talking to them they had mentioned their pet and had asked if my grandmother had seen them. It was a little brown Yorkie they had named princess. She explained that she hadn't seen the dog and that she would ask my grandfather to see if he knew anything about it.

After that a few things started escalating even more. When she would wake up in the middle of the night she would see people standing on their lawn, in a nice neat row like statutes, on multiple occasions. She would wake up my grandfather and they would call the police only for it to happen again a few nights later. The police couldn't do anything about it claiming that the people owned the land that the fire and "parties" were being held on and that if the police didn't actually catch them or see them on my grandparents property themselves then they could only issue a verbal warning.

One night my grandfather had decided he had had enough. He went out to where the fire was with a shot gun and fired it into the air. He Exclaimed "if you F\*\*ks don't stop harassing my family ill shoot everyone of you."

They all just turned and stared. He figured they had gotten the message and went back to their house.

My grandparents had decided to move out of the house not long after that because everything kept getting way worse.

Few months had passed, my mom was born, and my grandmother was back working for the real-estate agency she was working for before she had my mother. My grandparents were looking to move again and my grandmother decided to bring up that house they used to live in to another real-estate agent friend she worked with. She had hoped to move back hoping that those people were gone because the people were nice and the house was gorgeous. When she brought it up the woman looked at her and said in a serious tone "You don't want to live there."

My grandmother had explained that she did want to live there and she had before. She then asked why the woman had said that. The woman simply replied "it's better if I show you."

When they pulled up to the property, not even entering the house, my grandmother said it smelled horrible. from the outside you couldn't see in. when they went inside the entire inside of the house was painted a pitch black color. The windows were also painted that color and covered in tinfoil, so no light could get in, there were hex bags under the house with my grandparents initials on them and other things written on the other ones. In the garage there was a giant red pentagram painted on the floor. They went outside to the back yard that used to have a fire pit and where that fire pit was was a huge sink whole, they had to rope it off so the construction workers working on the place wouldn't get hurt. The shed in the back was painted black on the inside just like the house was and smelled like dead animal. It also had a few small animal bones in it. upon further inspection they found the collar to the neighbors dog in there too

To this day my grandmother believes that that is where the neighbors dog went too. I always hoped she was wrong. I always hoped the dog just wondered in there after being lost for so long to try and eat the bones, got its collar caught and ripped it off trying to get free. Every Time she tells this story I instantly get creeped out, and it doesn't stop there.

This is where I believe we were cursed some how. The women in my family have had a bad history trying to have kids. Each woman in my family has had at least two miscarriage's and even still when they do end up having children there are complications. My mother the first born, had multiple health issues causing her to be in and out of hospitals all her life. Which she recently passed away because of. After she was born my grandmother had two miscarriage's, after my oldest aunt was born she had one more miscarriage. When my mother was pregnant with me my grandmother was in a car accident with my youngest aunt that nearly killed both of them. My grandmother had to be in a wheel chair for months after it and still has trouble walking to this day because of it.

As time keeps moving on from what happed things have gotten worse. My oldest aunt and youngest aunt have heath issues, not major, but I still believe they are connected in some way. My mother miscarried twice before she had me, I have a heart defect and was born with an extra valve in my heart, I'm the only child. My cousin, the first born to my oldest aunt after I was born, had a tumor on her face. And my youngest cousin, born to my youngest aunt, had a few complications when he was born.

No one can be happy in this family. We are all f\*\*ked up in some way. Either it be severe/multiple heath issues or mental issues, we can't get away from it. We can't be happy.

Every house that they moved into after that house either had something really wrong with it or it was haunted.

I believe it was from that house and that cult. Call me crazy like my mom did when I tried to explain it to her but I'm almost positive that every issue we have had has been from that house and those people.

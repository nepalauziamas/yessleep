It started this morning. A Friday. A normal Friday. A morning when I wish I never heard of *them*.

I was reading the paper and enjoying my morning coffee. My girlfriend Megan was serving me a plate of scrambled eggs and toast, just how I liked them.

The headlines were screaming at me about pigs and how the pork industry was struggling to stay afloat. On the front page there was a disturbing photograph of a grinning pig with blood-stained yellow teeth that was burning into my brain.

I finished my coffee, and grabbed my bag. Megan stopped me in front of the door that was always locked, and gave me a quick peck on the cheek.

“Have a great day at work, sweetie!”

“Thank you, Meg,” I smiled. I had the best girlfriend a guy could ever ask for. We had been dating for months now and it was like she could read my mind. She was a genie, in other words, granting me anything I desired.

I headed out the front door, whistling my favourite tune, and made my way down the street to the subway station. Then a poster nailed to a streetlamp made my heart stop cold.

My face grinned back at me, much younger, like it was taken 20 years ago, against a beautiful beach. My hair was swaying lazily in the breeze and I could hear the ocean roaring in my ears. It would’ve been a photoshopped photograph of paradise, except for a tall silhouette standing behind me.

Crepey, pinky skin. A snout of a pig.

It was holding a knife to my throat.

My hand was sweating so much, and instinctively I grabbed the poster to wipe it off, and realised it was too rough and leathery and brown to be paper. No, it felt more like…human skin.

My face smiled and waved back. Like what he was going through was the most normal, most perfect thing in the world.

I glanced around, but no one except me noticed the poster. Everyone else was scurrying by like rats in a maze.

I backed away, and tore my gaze away from the paper. Then I ran.

I sat down on the subway, enjoying the monotony of the train on the tracks. It was a cold morning, and I was already sweating bullets. 

Sitting in front of me were three businessmen. As I watched my eyes nearly closing, their unintelligible conversation dwindled into piggy snorts and hooves burst out from their hands.

The headlines from this morning rattled around in my head. I was alert, my breath coming out in short gasps.

I alighted at the next station and fled to the office on foot. It felt longer than usual. Posters with my face waved back at me. Haunting me.

I got to the office, and everyone was staring at me even though I was on time. They were huddled in groups, whispering to each other. I started typing on my computer screen but I couldn’t concentrate.

“Oink oink oink.”

It sounded like a farm. I looked around and saw pigs in buisness suits and ties, standing around, holding knives. They glanced back at me and grinned.

I gulped, goosebumps rippling down my skin. My hands were shaking as I turned back to my computer. I wanted to run far away, but something was gluing me to my seat.

“Hey, you okay?”

It was my secretary.

“You look like you have seen a ghost.”

“Yeah,” I muttered. I was numb.

She handed me a newspaper. Fish and chips from the nearby shop. I nodded gratefully.

I wolfed it down, but my eyes were drawn to the headlines still screaming back. PIG. PIG. PIG.

As I finished the last chip, I gasped. A hoof print was inked onto the newspaper in blood.

I stood up shakily.

“I’m going home early today. Taking the afternoon off.”

Trying to act like it was normal.

“Okay. See you next week.”

She said it with a smile, but I noticed how wide her smile was becoming, how her teeth were yellowing like they were stained with nicotine, how her skin was increasingly pink and leathery.

My legs finally started working again. I ran.

I got back home, my head spinning. I kept on seeing him on the way home. Hiding behind the corner stand. Mingling with the commuters, reading a newspaper.

I knocked on the door. Megan answered with a smile.

“Let me in!” I gabbled. “He’s everywhere!”

Megan let out a hearty chuckle, then peeled back her face like an onion. Layer by layer. Out emerged that familiar pink, leathery skin and snout. Her ears moved to sit on the top of her head.

I turned around, but more figures emerged from the shadows to gather behind me. They were wearing blood-stained office clothes, and more blood was dripping from their snouts.

A hoof grabbed me, and I bit down hard. I spat out the sour bacon from my mouth and tore into the house, hoping to find a window to jump out or something.

“Good,” I heard her mutter. “Run. Dinner is more fun that way.”

There is nowhere to hide.

I’m typing this now in the closet, desperately hoping you guys can help me in some way. No one else is picking up. And I swear I saw torn, blood-stained police uniforms out there just now.

The sickly smell of mud is wafting inside the closet. I can hear excited oinking as hooves slosh through the mud.

They’re getting closer. My time is almost up.

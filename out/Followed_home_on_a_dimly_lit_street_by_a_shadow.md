I haven’t posted here yet, i have a few stories i could tell but this one from a couple weeks ago takes the cake for most recent.

I live next to a busy bar/ clubby street. Outside of that its a pretty quiet town. It almost goes from loud and fun and diners to quiet neighborhoods pretty quickly. My friend was walking me partially home after a couple drinks, he lives in all of that madness and I prefer the outskirts. There was a shortcut to walking back to my house which was about a 12 minute walk down the road from one of the bars and through a quiet street.

As he was walking me down to that street, I had a weird feeling to look behind me, my instincts have usually always been sharp and I see a man with a strong limp  down the ways. Mind you at this point were a ways behind a couple of the bars and its very dark the only light coming from the street lights off of the main drive. 

I couldnt make out what this man looked like? The lights behind him creating just a shadow silhouette. We walked further down to the back street i was going to follow home and he just said be careful text me when you’re home to which i said ok.

I stopped and turned around after a second and saw my friend walk right past this man who stopped and stared him dead in the face the entire time. I thought that was odd… the man then turned back towards me and started limping my way…

I decided to go an extra street down assuming this man cant possibly be walking that far, but the further from the drive i got.. the darker it got. Mind you it was 1am so these streets were quiet as could be. The street lights seemed so far apart but with how dark it was they barely lit up the street at all.

I turned and began walking down one of the streets.  I made it alittle ways down, a couple houses on either side of the street but none with their lights on. Quiet as a mouse. I looked back behind me and saw the limping man about to walk past the street i was on but then

He makes a full stop, his silhouette still just a dark shadow with baggy jeans and a loose jacket that seems to have only one sleeve. I cant see any facial features, but i saw his head turn. He was looking at me as i stood under a streetlight. A chill ran up my spine as he began limping towards me.

I turned and began walking, quickly. It was a very long ways to reach the end. After about 15 seconds i turned and looked behind me. I couldnt see him… maybe he lived at one of the houses i thought for a second. But about 3 street lights down from me if you really focused you could see him just on the outside of the light.

It was so dark i could barely see the outline of his body he stopped and was looking at me. Maybe hoping i didnt see him. I turned and began walking. Surely with his limp im faster i told myself.

Every now and again id turn and make sure he was far behind, but again i could only see him when he stepped in the light it was simply that dark. So sometimes i wouldnt see him. Until… I did, he was somehow closer now he was about 2 lights down from me.

So i ran down some now about 3/4 down the street. I turned behind me and saw him limping but not as far as he should of been, i kept trying to focus on him and see any part of his features but I couldn’t its like he didnt have any. Not even under the streetlights… 

I went back to walking and as i walked id turn and make sure he was still a ways behind me… but he was gaining ground somehow… then i realized… when he wasn’t under the streetlights… this man was running. He was faking a limp for when i turned around.

I froze for a second… he disappeared from under the light and as soon as he was enveloped in the dark u could hear it… the sound of his feet running. I turned and ran as fast as i could. To the right was another quiet street that lead to my house and to the left was the long way but it was the main streets.

I ran to the main street down the road. I turned and saw him at the end of the street we were on… he was barely in the light of the main street i was near. We looked at eachother and he turned around and just vanished.

The strangest part is my friend is a very particular person who would of remembered some strange man staring him down as he walked past but when i told him that man he passed followed me home he proceeded to ask “what man?” He didn’t have any recollection of him. Then it hit me that maybe he didn’t notice him because he didn’t see him? Just weird…

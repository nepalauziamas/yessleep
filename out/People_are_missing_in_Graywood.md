*Transcribed Broadcast from 880 WPAM, a local AM radio station in Graywood, Maine.*

There is a missing person poster on the telephone pole directly across the street from the station. Now, to you listening at home that might not sound like anything special, anything spectacular but to me, who is here, who has observed the thing for myself, well there is something special, something spectacular about this missing person poster. Particularly, there are three things special, spectacular and maybe even a little strange about this sheet of paper.

Firstly, we occupy this space, live in this town, that is barely pushing one thousand people. If there was, indeed, someone missing there is no way but by the grace of god that it would not be on my desk already. Secondly, the name. Starring at me through the glass is my producer. The one, the only, the fantastic and enigmatic Sarah Redwood. You may be asking yourself, and you would absolutely be right to do so, what in Sam’s Hill does my producer have to do with the name on the mysterious missing person poster? Well for those of you paying attention there is no doubt in my mind that the answer is obvious. Sarah Redwood is the name adorning this daunting, taunting tapestry of mystery. Last and by no means, by absolutely no means least is the image hung over my producer’s name. Now this, this is the first point of contention between myself and my producer- who, mind you has a glare that I fear will cut through the glass separating us- I saw a blank space. Just a square of inky blackness centered between the words ‘Missing’ and ‘Sarah Redwood’. What of the wonderful Ms. Redwood? Well, would you like to tell them what you told me?

*-There is a ten second space of dead air here, the host of the show, Jack Norwood would later state that it was him trying to convince her to speak.*

Well it seems Ms. Redwood is nervous, and I am afraid I do not blame her. You see when she passed it this morning she claimed that she saw her face **in** the poster. No, I did not misspeak, Not on it, in it. It was not a simple picture being displayed in two dimensional space, no, she saw herself caught in this oppressive darkness soundlessly screaming at the top of her lungs. And before you yell at your radio “c’mon Jack it was a trick of the light, just a picture, some kind of other trick!” I hear you, I hear you, believe me, I hear you but the look in her eyes when she told me what happened next, well, all I can say is that while I invite you to make your own opinions, I believe her. I believe Sarah. I believe you. What happened next? Well. You’ll have to join us back from the break to find out. This has been Norwood and Redwood mornings in Graywood. See you soon.

*-The ad break was cut short, from what I’ve been told it was scheduled to be four minutes, twenty-seven seconds. It was only two minutes, twenty-two seconds. When the program returns, Jack’s voice is different, slower more somber.*

Welcome back, Graywood, welcome back. Now, to finish this terrible, terrible tale. Ms. Redwood gazed into this impossible oddity at her own screaming face for what seemed to be hours. Tears began to spill down her face. She did not feel them. She could not feel them. She could not feel anything. Sarah had only become aware that she was crying because she found herself staring not at the prisoner of the dark but rather her own crying face standing on the street. She screamed. It was silent. I asked her what happened next, how did she escape? She looked at me, eyes cold, lifeless. “I don’t think I did” she whispered. A chill shot down my spine, unlike anything I had ever felt in my life. There was a certain conviction to her voice and well when you’re in my line of work you learn to understand what’s in a voice and let me tell you she was telling the truth.

\-*There’s fifteen seconds of what sounds like crying here, nothing else of note*

Now listen to my voice as I tell you the truth, full of conviction. While we were on our break Sarah, poor sweet Sarah, she… she disappeared, vanished before my eyes without a damn trace. Sarah Redwood is missing.

\-*There is dead air for two minutes, five seconds before the broadcast cuts out completely. There’s a strange sound in the background, when I first heard it, I could’ve sworn it was praying but no matter how much I try to clean it up all I hear is static. Jack claimed he didn’t hear anything either. As far as I’m aware PD still has him custody, despite the overwhelming amount of disappearances that have happened after his arrest. I was hoping I’d have more time, maybe even be able to figure out what was going on but I saw my own poster this morning. I couldn’t leave either.*

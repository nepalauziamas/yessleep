I'm what you might call a recluse -- someone who rarely goes out and would prefer to be by themselves, away from others. And I totally understand why people might see me that way. I work from home and I never leave my house. I draw all my curtains closed and my lawn is an overgrown mess. So yeah, I can understand people calling me a recluse.

The only problem I have with being branded a recluse is that it's unfair. I don't *choose* to stay inside so much. I don't *choose* to neglect my friends when they have gatherings.

You see, I'm forced to stay inside because my shadow nearly killed me the last time I stepped into the sunlight.

Weird thing is, all through childhood I was the most active, outdoorsy kid ever. There was hardly a day where I *wasn't* outside -- I would greet my neighbors from the lawn when they came home from work. Mom wouldn't even keep the front door locked because she knew I was always outside playing basketball or biking or doing some other activity. As I progressed through high school, I became  a track star and could run in the sun for what felt like hours. All through my adult life I've never stopped going on runs and playing basketball at the outdoor community court. This all changed the day after I turned 25, though.

I was practicing my layups outside on the driveway that afternoon. The sun, which was previously obscured, began peeking out from behind the passing clouds. I continued shooting hoops until a sudden crackling sound caught me off guard. I stopped and stood there, listening to my surroundings to make sure I wasn't going crazy. I was dumbfounded at this sound that was seemingly coming from nowhere.

That is, until I turned around to face my shadow and saw light smoke forming spontaneously at the edges. I stood there watching for a few seconds as the ground it was covering started to fizzle and crack. The air just above my shadow was so hot that it caused the tar to look like it was dancing.

Intrigued, I watched silently until I saw my shadow grasp for its head with both arms, bend over as if in pain, and then sprint off without warning into the shade casted by my car. I had just watched my shadow *detach* from me and *relocate* itself. I ran for the side door of the house and slammed it shut after what I just saw registered in my head.

When I went back inside, my shadow was cast again under the lightbulbs I had in the house. I stood there in the hall, sweating and heart palpitating, waiting for my shadow to do something. It did nothing but mirror my nervous jittering, like a normal shadow. I mustered the courage to move after what seemed like an eternity of standing as still as I could at my door.

I took one step, checked my shadow, and then took another. It was moving perfectly in tandem with my body. What the fuck did I just see outside then? Was I hallucinating? Was I remembering it wrong? I walked all the way upstairs to my bedroom, not letting my shadow out of my sight. I sat in bed, replaying the whole scene in my head over and over. Something was definitely wrong, but fuck if I knew how to even *begin* tackling this problem. I took some melatonin and watched some TV until inevitably knocking out.

I woke up a few hours later out of nowhere. I blinked a few times and squinted while I looked out the window to my right. The sun was just starting to ascend over the mountains in the distance. I panned around my room, making sure everything was as it should be. I was still rattled by the bizarre goings-on of the previous evening. After making sure I was safe, I sank back into my mattress and tried to get more shut-eye.

That was when I heard it.

The sizzling started again. I quickly opened my eyes and just stared at the ceiling, frozen. it was coming from my left side. I sat up and turned to see my shadow's head twitching and its torso convulsing. My sheets were browning at the edges of the silhouette and smoke began emanating from the outline of the shadow. It began to let out the most inhuman wheeze as it seemingly gasped for air. I watched, eyes wide and jaw clenched.

Without uttering a sound, I jumped out of bed, spilling the blanket and pillows onto the floor. I ran downstairs, through the hallway, and towards the front door. I turned the deadbolt and yanked the chain lock out of its socket, before heaving the door open.

I had taken the first step of my sprint outside when I was knocked back, flying into the foyer.  My head bounced off the wall and I landed crookedly on the hardwood floor. The last thing I remember seeing is my shadow, which was jutting out from beneath my body. It was dark and clearly defined - the morning sun shone brightly through the open front door. I closed my eyes, hearing the sizzling again before the door slammed shut. I fell unconscious.

When I came to, it was completely dark. I looked at the home security keypad which cast dim blue light into the shadowy expanse of the foyer.

*11:49 PM*.

I was out for over half a day. That means I missed work. But more importantly, my head was killing me and my ankle was sprained, probably because of how I landed. I reached down to grab my ankle before the keypad assistant interrupted me.

*"MOVEMENT DETECTED IN ROOM 5 - BEDROOM,"* the robotic voice announced.

I stared at the blue screen, completely paralyzed with fear.

"MOVEMENT DETECTED IN ROOM 3 - GUEST ROOM," it continued.

"MOVEMENT DETECTED IN ROOM 1 - FOYER"

I let out a yelp as I painstakingly jumped to my feet and dragged myself along the wall to find the light switch. I flicked the switch as soon as I found it and the foyer light turned on. I stood frozen, my eyes darting back and forth to scan for any danger.

Complete silence.

I looked down at my aching ankle, and then at my shadow. It was perfectly still, just as I was. But then I heard it wheezing. The wheezing then erupted into laughter. It sounded just like my laughter. I stood and fixated on the silhouette, expecting some kind of movement. But nothing. The laugh continued to emanate from the shadow with no deviation from my current position whatsoever.

It finally clicked -- artificial light seemed to restrain its movement, darkness allowed it to move freely, and sunlight injured it, sending it into a violent frenzy.

Since that night, I've set up blackout curtains at every window of my house, and installed lamps and extra light fixtures in nearly every room. My house is alight 24/7. This seems to keep my shadow tethered to my body, and I manage to get somewhat restful sleep with a blindfold on.

The only time I'm woken up is when I hear my shadow giggling in the middle of the night. But I've gotten used to that at this point.

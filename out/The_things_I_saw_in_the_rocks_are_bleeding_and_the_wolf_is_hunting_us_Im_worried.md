We were driving down a  small road outside of my hometown like usual every year, looking at the camping spots for this year's camp. It's been a long time since our last family camping trip (2020) and we thought we should look at some new areas this year as a fresh start. I love nature and have grown up around it for as long as I can remember. I was looking out the passenger window watching the cliffs and trees pass as we looped back and forth through the forest. I was looking at the holes in the rocks when we passed the cliffsides and thought I saw what looked like faces, but not human. They looked like skulls of animals, white with some having cracks running throughout. 

I ignored them for awhile, as they only showed up every mile or so, but when I focused on the window, I saw some of the skulls I had seen prior. They looked like they were made of the same material as what happens when you breath or slide your fingers across the glass, and when I touched one, it smudged and then faded slowly. After an hour or do I eventually noticed that the faces in the holes started to grow steadily redder, as if they were decomposing in reverse. By this time the sun was slowly setting and my wife turned on the headlights. The faces were completely covered in red by this point, but I realized it wasn't muscle tissue on the skulls, as they didn't grow the fibers associated with muscle, but they grew red with blood.

 I started to shake at this realization, just as we turned into a rest stop. I decided to calm my nerves and buy some snacks. When I headed back to the car with my wife, I looked into the treeline and saw something that haunts my nightmares. A giant White wolf, muzzle completely stained with blood. It looked me dead in the eyes, and I noticed something quite unusual. It had eyes the color of amethysts, seemingly glowing. I told my wife to slowly walk back to the car while I followed in tow. As soon as she made her first step and we both looked away for a moment, it was gone. We both looked cautiously around, but nothing could have disappeared that quickly without making a sound. 

We both got into the car and drove slowly until we were sure it was gone, then made a break back the way we had come. I saw the skulls when I looked out her window, but this time they were all wolf skulls. When the sun had fully set we were only about two miles from home, but that was all it took. The wolf suddenly appeared out of the woods to our right, and just as quickly transformed into a sickly creature, a man but not a man. My wife slammed the break as we hit it. The sound of cracking bones and screeching metal filled my ears as it was sent flying. When it got up I got a good look at it. It walked on all fours and was pale as snow. It looked human but wore the skull and pelt of a wolf. I yelled at my wife to drive as it started running towards us, something that should not be possible considering we just hit it with our car. She pressed the gas pedal so hard I thought it might snap and we sped of down the road at around 40 MPH. The thing  kept up with us until we reached the city, and it stopped just as we crossed into the first road with a street sign. We both sighed in relief as it stated to turn and run into the forest just outside the city. We sent the car to the mechanic and got the whole front repaired. I started researching similar stories in our area, and found an old Navajo myth about something known as a Skinwalker. I have not gone into the woods since. Might update if I hear anything else like this.

I’ve never been one to engage in gossip, it felt pointless. My school isn’t abnormally large; it would take days to catch up on gossip from just a week, so I just never payed attention. But, some rumors stick around for so long it’s inevitable to know the story.  At some point it’s not gossip, it’s common sense.  It’s a story everyone who goes to my school knows, though anyone outside of the district would see it as silly gossip… but it’s not. It’s a gut feeling, something that has no real proof, nothing but the alarms in your head yelling at you to believe the eerie words spoken about her. To stay away from her.

Her name was Maeve. She was quiet and timid, she never spoke in class and always kept her head down. No one even believes she had lived here before 8th grade, even if her transcript says otherwise. She was in my math class freshman year and only spoke loud enough for the teacher to hear, having chosen the seat closest to their desk.  I don’t think I had actually heard her voice until a week before the end of that year. She wasn’t well known and didn’t have many friends, but she had some.  She sat in a corner of the school courtyard with a few other students, occasionally the others would come and go but she never sat in another place. Her entire persona was unnerving unmoving.

No one really payed attention to her until a few days before fall break.  At first, people were saying that she spoke in class and actually had a full on conversation loud enough for people to hear. The only reason people really cared was because of how worked up others were over it.  How her voice was as ‘sweet as honey’… melodic like a piano ballad. Their eyes almost white.  It was all anyone could talk about for the rest of the day.  People searched for her, wanting to hear her voice for themselves.  But, it seemed as though she disappeared.

One of the students who was present to hear her that day had broke up with his girlfriend. Two others kept jabbering about it, and another actually tried to ask her out. People joked that she had hypnotized them with her voice, but that’s all it was, a joke. that’s what we told ourselves. Still, I kept my distance; something about her was off.

Then the next day was met with two more break-ups, and a rather large bouquet of flowers crudely stuffed in her desk. 

The female students started theorizing that it was just some dumb superiority complex, and the guys were attempting to stake claim now that she was the ‘hot topic’.  I couldn’t help but notice how she had crawled back into her shell. But, what I hadn’t noticed was how far she had come… until she was back to looking like a broken doll, trying to hold itself together.  The hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I watched her. The way she walked, the way she carried herself, just didn’t feel right.  A lump formed in my throat, a pounding in my head screaming at me to get away look away.

People started to pity her; unsolicited affection can only be handled to a certain extent.  Her boundaries were more than likely more sensitive than normal. Everyone held a sense of protectiveness over her, giving the courters a hard time. Things eventually died down and when fall break started, the whole ordeal was largely disregarded.  That was until two boys were arrested for harassment, along with breaking and entering.  They were identified as Sebastian and Tristan, two students who were in Maeve’s presence, who heard her speak. The trial was relatively quick, both had restraining orders and 7 months in juvie. 

It was startling, but it could never prepare the school for what was about to go down. The night they were meant to be carted off to juvie, they broke out, beelining for Maeve’s house.  That’s where the others were camping out to “protect her.”

3 people died that night.  Tristan and Sebastian themselves were amongst the dead, the third being a student by the name of Andrew.  Tristan was beaten to death, while Sebastian and Andrew were shot. The three other male students were arrested and put on trial.

When school started back up, we were divided.  Some saw her as an omen of death, or perhaps a siren, hypnotizing men with her voice.  Others thought she was a victim, being aggressively pursued only to be harassed and have three boys die on your front lawn. Maeve kept her head down for the rest of the year. I could breath again.

Students then started to bully her, slipping crude notes into her locker, calling her names, and threatening her to never speak to their boyfriends or crushes. Some people comforted and stood up for her, but she never spoke. The teachers never called on her and she eventually just faded back into the background, whispers and rumors being the only thing that kept her name alive. 

Then, Sam started to follow her around. He just trailed behind her as close as possible. No matter how fast she walked or where she went, he was there. She never spoke up about it, and he never touched her.  There was nothing anyone could do about it not that anyone wanted to.   It went on for weeks, just trailing behind, eyes locked on her as if she was the only thing that existed in his world.  People started to trade rumors again; how far would this go? When would things start to go wrong? 

The next thing we knew, search parties were sent out for Sam, he just… disappeared. No trace, no leads, nothing.  We all knew it, but there was nothing we could say that would be taken seriously. Maeve started showing up with more bruises that week.

Three months ago, a boy committed suicide. His letter was simply a confession to Maeve, telling her how madly in love he was with her, and how he couldn’t live if she didn’t love him back. The school tried to keep it under wraps, not wanting the backlash that Maeve would inevitably receive to get out of hand.  But, there was no use, she’d walk into class with bruises and cuts, black eyes and swollen lips. People said she deserved it, others said it was good that she couldn’t seduce anyone else.  Some even pitied her.

I didn’t think any of that, god, I was scared, all I did was stare and wonder why she would let it happen. Why she didn’t just move away or defend herself.  I couldn’t help my curiosity. 

It was three days ago when I was running an errand for my teacher and found her wobbling out of the girls bathroom.  Blood running down her knees, fresh cuts and bruising.  I didn’t know what to do, yet I carried her to the nurse’s office and stayed with her until her parents came to pick her up. I felt like I was on autopilot… what was I even thinking?

I knew I knew I’d get in trouble, but I couldn’t just leave her there. Before she walked out of the nurse’s office, she whispered something to me.  I heard it, but I didn’t understand it until she hesitated, her breathe caught in her throat. She thought for a moment before speaking again.

“I’m sorry.”

She was apologizing? It broke my heart how fragile she was. I never understood how people could hurt her, how easily they could just ignore her.  She was… beautiful, she radiated magnificence.

I didn’t understand how I was ever scared of her.

My god, her voice was heavenly. I knew no one else would understand, they all saw her as a monster or someone who needed pity.  I knew better, though.

No one deserved her, she was something above us all.

She didn’t come to school the next day, I bit my nails and scratched myself in worry.  It more than just bugged me, I needed to make sure she was okay.  I hastily questioned the school nurse on her absence.

“Oh? You’re the boy who brought her in yesterday,” she gave a tight smile, her lips pressing into a thin line.  “Her mom called her in sick today.”

I felt relieved, but uneasy.

“Um, can I call her house? I just want to check up on her…” that’s all I needed, just another moment to feel closer to her.

The nurse thought for a moment before declining. My throat burned, my head was fuzzy.  I needed to see her.

I gave a stiff nod and continued on with the day.  I asked around to try and find out what bus she was on, what her stop was.  Until, I remembered a girl who once mentioned Maeve only lived a few doors down from her.  So, I followed her bus to her house. It was easy to spot Maeve’s house.  It had been engrained in my brain ever since it was on the news Sophomore year.

I could spot her window with ease. It almost felt like fate when I noticed the closest tree was so easily climbable.

And listen… you have to understand.  I know I sound like all those guys who became obsessed with her, but I swear I’m not. I knew her worth, I had wanted to speak to her for so long but was scared.  I just didn’t deserve to speak to her.  No, nobody did.

Everyone else held her down, trapped her, undeserving of her presence.

No one else could see it, but I could.  She never deserved to be tortured like that.  So, I’m going to put her out of her misery.

I’m doing this for her. 

I’ll be her salvation.

She won’t need to live like this anymore.

I’ll be back tomorrow.

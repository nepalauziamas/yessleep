My brother has always been a journalist at heart, always wanting to investigate and get a good story, so when he told me he was going to a village called Thistlestone in Scotland for some investigation, I honestly wasn't surprised, when he has his heart set on something, he won't stop. He was texting me when he arrived, typical outsider stuff, the locals didn't like him, the police gave him glares, etc. He mentioned seeing a big old manor that was actually the name of the town, Thistlestone Manor, my brother said he got strange vibes from it. What really disturbed me though was when he said he was heading back because he said the locals were really starting to creep him out, they were silent when he came in the pub, avoided him when he started asking questions and then the police kept warning him to stop harassing the locals. 

Eventually he stopped replying, which is very unlike him. I tried calling him but it went straight to voicemail. Our friends and parents hasn't heard from him either, so in the end, I decided to go and find him myself, I'm self employed, so work wasn't an issue. Thistlestone was a really long trip and I was getting impatient trying to find it. When I finally arrived, it didn't look that good, it was just a really old village with a pub, a school, a church, a police station, a small hospital, a hotel and a dentist. When I checked into the hotel, the woman handed me my keys and quickly scurried away, clearly not wanting to be near me. I saw a well dressed man coming downstairs, briefly giving me a look of curiosity. I unpacked everything then went outside to find this house he mentioned, which I found no problem. It was a really old historical looking manor with a large water fountain. One of the gardeners there and introduced himself as Rob. After explaining why I'm here, he looked around and motioned me to follow him, we arrived in a shed. He told me my brother found out a big town secret, and went missing when the police started looking for him.

Rob warned me to leave Thistlestone as the locals will find out about me and will not be happy that I'm here. After I left, I went to the local pub, I badly needed a drink after today. After I sat down, the well dressed man from before slid me a note, here's what it said :

" They know what happened to your brother, and they'll do the same to you, check the church, collect everything and get out of here "

Obviously I was creeped out but curious, so I decided to go check after avoiding those creepy locals. I arrived at the church, and started walking down to the basement, since the church  was very small, I didn't find my brother, but I found something worse

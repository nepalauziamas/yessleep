My family has always been very religious. My oldest sibling, Alexa never really believed in that stuff. As a child me and most of my siblings ( I’m one of ten) were scared of the basement. It wasn’t finished and that really just made it creepier. 
 
One day Alexa was having a sleepover with 3 of her friends. One of them brought a ouija board. They decided to do it in the scariest part of the house, the basement. I snuck downstairs and was watching them. They got out the ouija board and began playing with it. They asked questions like,”Is there a spirit here with us?” No answer. “ If there is someone here please make yourself known.” There was suddenly a loud bang in the back corner of the storage section on the basement. 

They all jumped and I did also. I composed myself and they asked the next question. “What is your name?” On the ouija board it spelled out *Aamon*  The lights started to flicker. The only reason I didn’t scream an run out is because I didn’t want them to catch me.
They kept speaking to it and asking it questions such as- Are you evil(yes) have you come here to cause harm(yes) is hell real(yes) will I go to hell (all will).  When it said all will go to hell I got shivers down my spine.

They freaked out and ran upstairs. I was stuck downstairs with whatever it was. I heard a bang in the exercise room. Something whispered in my ear *I know where you are*. I didn’t care if i got caught at this point. I ran upstairs. Alexa asked me what I was doing down there. I told her everything. 

She forgot to say goodbye. I told her this. Now there was a demon set loose in our house. Great.

Ever since then strange things have been happening. The lights flicker sometimes. My parents think there is something wrong with the wiring. Alexa was too scared to tell them what they were doing. If you don’t know, ouija boards are a big no no for christians. They would flip if they found out. 

Nothing too crazy has happened since. Like I said, mostly just lights flickering. Well actually something more weird has happened. I was sleeping in my room when the crucifix that was hanging on my wall fell. I freaked out and went to Alexas room. She said it was just the wind. I know she was just trying to make me feel better.

Today my siblings were bored. Sometimes we go in the basement to play hide-and-seek in the dark. I was reluctant to go for obvious reasons, but my siblings pressured me into it. Well I got found first, so I had to seek. I counted to 100 then started to look. I was so scared. My mind made me think I was seeing ghosts.

My eyes adjusted to the dark and I saw the silhouette of someone on top of the freezer. They looked tall so i assumed it was Alexa. I said “Alexaaaa I found you” the only answer was silence. “Alexa this is not funny I found you” silence again. I was too scared so I screamed “I quit!!” it was more of a cry though.

I ran to turn the lights on and I immediately looked over to the freezer. No one there. I would’ve seen or heard if she jumped down. There was stacked up mattresses and Alexa squeezed out of them. “What we’re you talking about there was no one there” Alexa said. “No there was someone there I saw their shadow” I replied.

Everyone came out of their hiding places and agreed that they saw no one. I decided that I didn’t want to be down there anymore so I ran upstairs.

Later that night Alexa asked me if I really saw someone. I insisted that I did. She decided to go downstairs and check if there was anything there. She climbed onto the freezer and to our horror, there was a name scratched on the top of it. Aamon. I told Alexa that if she didn’t tell our parents, then I would.

Alexa told them and they FREAKED. They called our local priest right away. He blessed our house but that didn’t put an end to it. One night we were all sleeping, and all the tv’s in the house flicked on. They started playing the Exorcist. That was the last straw. We moved out a couple days later. 

Even now, years later, it still haunts me. I have my own house and sometimes the house settles and I think of everything that happened. I think maybe Aamon decided to invade and plague my life once again.

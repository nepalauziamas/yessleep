That night, when I ate dinner with Grandpa, he felt like a stranger. I’d decided not to confront him with what I’d discovered. I was barely able to touch my food, as I kept stealing glances at him.

“You're quiet tonight,” he said.

“Yeah. Sorry.”

He smiled at me. His benevolence suddenly seemed unsettling.

Later that night, in my bedroom, I recorded another diary entry. Here’s what I said:

*July eighth. Second entry. So, Lacey. You may have found a way to protect yourself from the ghosts, but maybe they're not the only thing in this house that can hurt you. It's pretty clear you can't trust Grandpa anymore. There's only one choice left. You're gonna have to do what you've been dreading, but what you always knew you were gonna have to do eventually. Tomorrow. When he's out hunting . . . You have to leave the house, Lacey. You have to step outside.*

Until I had the opportunity to leave the next day, I had to humor Grandpa, not arouse any suspicion. So when it came time to be strapped into bed again, I raised a mild protest, but eventually gave in. Being restrained all night was hardly pleasant, but with the talisman, I could at least be assured I wouldn’t be killed. To prevent Grandpa from seeing it, I took it off my neck and clutched it in my fist.

“Now. I got you a nice new mattress,” he said, tightening a strap around my left arm. “And I have strapped it down to the frame, so it won't topple over again. Okay?”

As he leaned over, a necklace fell out of his shirt. It looked almost exactly like Suzie's talisman.

“Where did you get that necklace?” I asked.

“Oh,” he said, tucking it back in. “An old Indian man gave it to  me, many many years ago. He said it wards off evil spirits. I don't really believe in that stuff, but I have never been troubled by an evil spirit, so why tempt the fate, eh? . . . Okay, open wide.” He inserted the mouthguard into my mouth. “There we go. I will leave the door open tonight, okay? Nighty-night.” 

It wasn’t too long after when ghosts started to emerge. They formed a circle around me, just standing there, watching me. Some familiar faces were there: Jacob Walters, Mark Sheldon, Sarah Bennings, Dr. Woodley. Others were new.

As the minutes ticked by, I fought to stay awake, but I could feel myself drifting off to sleep. The fist that held the talisman started to relax, and the talisman started to slide out of my grip. Walters, Sheldon, and a few other miscreants stepped forward hungrily. I jolted back awake, catching the talisman on its string with one finger, just before it slipped to the floor. The ghosts stepped back, disappointed.

I wrapped the string around my fingers several times, and gripped the talisman tightly again.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Grandpa sat on his chair, me on the couch, for what was hopefully the last time. My goal was to get him out of the house as soon as possible, without arousing suspicion. If I tried to pretend everything was okay, he’d see through it. So I went with being sullen and uncommunicative. 

“Do you want to talk about how you're feeling about what you learned about your mother?” Grandpa asked.

*You mean how her existence turned out to be a lie created by the two people I trusted the most, leaving me feeling more alone than ever?* I thought. But I just shrugged.

“Do you feel betrayed?” Grandpa pressed. “Are you angry at me and your father?” 

I shrugged.

“What about the injuries to your hand and to your . . . privates. Have you decided once and for all if you did them yourself?”

I sighed. “I dunno.”

“You don't know?”

“I guess I did, I dunno.”

“You guess. Have you ever tried to hurt yourself before?”

“I dunno. Maybe. I don't remember.”

I could see Grandpa growing frustrated. “What did you hope to accomplish by doing this? By concocting that lie? By wasting the time of the police and the medical examiners, and causing us all a great deal of worry?”

I shrugged again.

Grandpa sighed. “Okay. This doesn't look like it's going to be a very productive session. I know you're angry at me. But you're stuck here with me. And I am still here to help you. You can make it difficult or you can make it easy. I'm going to go hunting. You think about it. Difficult or easy. Okay?” 

He got up and left. I watched him go, hoping he didn’t notice my knee jiggling with nervous energy.

I waited until he’d been gone for a quarter hour or so before springing into action. I went up to my room and stuffed a backpack full of essentials: clothes, snacks, a water bottle. If I somehow managed to overcome my phobia, I had no idea how long I’d have to walk before I found civilization. I put on my shoes. I checked the talisman around my neck. Then I started making my way towards the front door. 

The closer I got to the door, the more uneasy I felt. It was hard to believe that after all the things I’d experienced in that house, nothing scared me more than leaving it.

I slowed down as I neared the door, walking slowly, with effort, as if I was walking through water. My breath started getting quicker. I reached for the doorknob, then stopped, my hand inches away. I closed my eyes tight.

*You can do this. You can do this, Lacey. You have to do this.*

I grabbed the doorknob, turned it, started opening the door slowly, at a snail's pace. Daylight streamed into the house. Outdoor noises, foreign to my ears, started up. Birds chirping. Wind.

The door was now completely open. I took a few tentative steps forward, onto the porch. I stood still for a moment. I was shaken, but still breathing. Still alive.

*I was beating it.*  

But the very moment I felt victorious, I started to gasp and choke. I wavered unsteadily, my hands flailing for support that didn't exist. I sank to my knees, wheezing and choking. Finally, I toppled over on my side. And everything went black.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I woke to Grandpa's concerned face hovering above me, and the sharp fumes of smelling salts.

“Grandpa?” I said, woozily.

“Lacey! Thank God you're awake. How do you feel?”

“My head hurts,” was all I could think to say.

“I am very cross with you, young lady. That was a foolish thing you did.”

I held my head, wincing in pain. “What did I do?” I asked, honestly not remembering.

Grandpa snorted. “You know very well. You tried to go outside. You could have killed yourself, you know that? There's nobody around for miles. Never try that again. Never.” He handed me a steaming cup of tea from the coffee table. “Here. Drink this tea. I have to go into town. Run some errands.”

He picked up his satchel and a stack of letters from the mantelpiece. “We'll talk about this more when I return. Don't try to leave. Oh, I have to make a pee-pee first.”

He put down his satchel, placed the letters on the coffee table, and left the room.

I looked at the letters. The top one was addressed to Martin Scott – my dad. My heart started to race as an idea came to me. I looked to make sure that Grandpa was gone, then grabbed the letter and held it seal-down over my tea, steaming it open. I opened the envelope and removed the letter inside. A quick skim revealed it to be a routine letter from Grandpa to Dad, saying some crap about how I was making progress.

As an old man, Grandpa took a longer-than-normal time to pee, but I still needed to hurry. From a cup on the coffee table holding office supplies, I grabbed a red marker and a glue stick. I wrote on the letter, over Grandpa’s handwriting:

*Dad, PLEASE come and get me. I think Grandpa is a VERY SICK MAN. Lacey.*

I heard the sound of Grandpa's humming gradually getting louder as he returned to the living room.

Frantically, I re-folded the letter and stuck it back in the envelope. I grabbed the glue stick, re-sealed the envelope, and dropped it back on the pile. Then I grabbed my tea and sipped it nonchalantly as Grandpa walked into the room.

Grandpa picked up his satchel and the letters. “How about fish sticks for supper?” he said.

“Sure,” I replied, nonchalantly.

“Try and get some rest,” he said, with what seemed like genuine concern, making me momentarily feel guilty after he left.

*No,* I scolded myself. *He’s a liar, and you can’t trust him.*

I didn’t know what to do with myself while he was gone. I paced down the hall, anxiously fidgeting. I sat on the couch. I looked at my watch. I paced in front of my window. 

Finally, I saw Grandpa’s truck pull up in front of the house and come to a stop. I rushed back to the couch, flopped myself down, and feigned sleep. 

I heard the sound of Grandpa entering the house. He walked into the living room, carrying two shopping bags. I feigned waking up and yawning.

Grandpa sat down on his chair. “You got some sleep. Good.” He looked at me. There was something strange about his look.

“Did you get your errands done?” I asked, trying to appear casual.

“Ya.”

“All of them?”

“Ya.”

I kept trying to probe, without seeming like I was trying to probe. “Did you mail those letters?”

He smiled. “Ya. Why?”

“No reason. Just, sometimes you forget things.”

“Oho! I'm not that old you know! Well. Better put these away.” He picked up the groceries and headed into the kitchen.

I sat on the couch, thinking to myself. If the letter was on its way to Dad, I felt reasonably good about my chances of getting out of there. Dad may have participated in the ruse about my mother, but I could see, from his point of view, why he would have done that, and I’d already forgiven him. I got up and followed Grandpa to the kitchen.

I stood in the doorway and watched as Grandpa unpacked groceries. He favored me with a smile. My gaze drifted over to the kitchen table. I yelped in fright, covering my mouth with my hands.

Grandpa’s letter to Dad lay on the table, my handwriting scrawled on it.

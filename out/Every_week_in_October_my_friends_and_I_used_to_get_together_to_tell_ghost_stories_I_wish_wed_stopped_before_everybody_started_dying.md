 It all [started here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wptk8e/comment/ikmdk1u/?context=3)

&#x200B;

Eddie and Lex were reluctant to meet at Meadow House again the following Friday. They’d also noticed the similarities between the recent deaths and our stories. JD, as usual, was deeply skeptical. 

“I’m just saying that people die all of the time in all kinds of gruesome ways,” he said as we gathered at the gate. “It’s just random and crazy. Chaos or whatever.” 

We filed in, each touching the post with its four scratches before walking towards the decayed front door. I dropped back to talk with Tone, who was bringing up the rear. 

“What if JD is a serial killer?” I joked. “He could be using us for inspiration.” 

I laughed. Tone didn’t. 

“Chris, if it’s not the house feeding off of us like I think, then the next logical conclusion…”

She waited for me to fill in the gaps. 

“You think one of us could be killing people?” 

Tone shrugged but looked around at the others. I followed suit. There was no way she was right. Which of us could be a psycho killer? Short little Tone the movie buff? Eddie the honor student? JD was a stoner and Lex was caught mid-way between goth and gamer girl. I couldn’t picture any of my friends doing anything eviler than JD playing pranks on Halloween each year. Hell, the four of us met in kindergarten; I knew my friends better than I knew myself. 

JD took the lead walking into Meadow House, followed by Lex and Eddie walking close together, and Tone and me in the back. The front door swung open on ancient hinges, tilting off its axis so much I half-expected it to fall on JD. He looked back at us and grinned.

“So, it’s Lex’s turn to tell the story tonight, right?” 

Lex scrunched down into her hoodie. “I don’t really want to. I don’t understand what we’re doing here.” 

“Just checking out the house,” Eddie said. He shot a glance at Tone and me since we were the ones who came to the group with Tone’s theory. “Which, I guess means checking for anything strange or…like, bodies in the basement?” 

Tone shrugged. “Anything at all. Any signs of the paranormal. Or,” she chirped, like the thought just struck her out of the dark, “or, or, *or* what if there are signs that someone is living in Meadow House? Someone who might have been listening while we told our stories?” 

My intestines knotted up like rat tails. I was skeptical of anything supernatural going on but a serial killer squatting in Meadow House and eavesdropping on our Friday night frights was deeply, *awfully* possible. I suddenly regretted not bringing anything more defensible than a flashlight into the ruins of the mansion. 

Even JD’s nailed-on smile wavered a little at the thought that there might be somebody in the house with us. But he recovered quickly and pressed on.

“Okay, if Lex doesn’t want to take her turn, I’ll just swamp and take mine, instead. So, have you heard the story of-”

“I’m not sure that’s a good idea,” Tone warned.

JD just smiled wider. “Have you heard the story of the Toothy Shadow?” 

There was a thud from deep in the house. We all stopped, standing in the middle of the massive foyer. 

“No way,” Eddie said. “No, no, no, nope.” 

Lex was holding his arm. “Just a coincidence?” 

“We should go,” Tone said. “I was wrong. We shouldn’t be in here.” 

“Too late,” JD whispered, looking behind us. “Oh God, guys, I’m sorry.” 

I turned to see whatever he was seeing. I immediately regretted it. People-shaped shadows stood between us and the front door. I counted a dozen before I stopped. Each silhouette came bleeding out of the walls or windows, peeling themselves away. And each shadow was featureless other than a wide ring of mouth full of square white teeth and red tongue. The shapes began to move towards us.

“*Run*,” Eddie said.

I grabbed Tone’s hand and we ran. So did the others. I wanted to shout that we should stay together. That’s the basic rule, right? Never split up in a haunted house. But JD was already going in a different direction. Eddie and Lex went up the stairs while Tone and I sprinted for the hall connected to the foyer. 

“The others…” Tone said. 

I looked back over my shoulder just in time to see a patch of darkness closing in on us, oversized teeth chattering. 

“Faster,” I yelled, yanking Tone down the hall. 

There was a door open on our right. I pulled us both in and kicked it shut in the same motion, pressing my back against it. It dawned on me that barricading a door might not do much to stop a shadow but I didn’t have a lot of other ideas at that moment. The room was dark with only a little light slipping in from the hall. There was a click then an orange glow close to my face. Tone was holding a lighter up. 

“I think we’re okay,” she whispered. 

The tiny flame cast small shadows around us. I watched one of the things wrap a thread-thin arm around Tone’s throat. 

“Put out the light,” I yelled.

It was too late. Shadow fibers spread across her neck and face. Tone’s expression was more surprised than scared. Something yanked her backward and she dropped the lighter. It hit the floor and went out, returning the room to the dark. I scrambled on my hands and knees for the lighter. When I couldn’t find it, I threw open the door to the hallway. Dim light filtered in confirming what I already knew. 

I was alone in the room. 

“Tone,” I said. “Tone!” 

I was screaming at a bare wall and moth-eaten mattress. Something small and fast skittered down the hall past the room. My pulse hit overdrive. Tone’s lighter was laying on the dirty wooden floor next to me. I scooped it up and crept into the hallway. It was brighter than the bedroom I just left but I couldn’t see why; there were no apparent lights or windows, just an omnipresent glow. I hesitated, unsure of whether I should go deeper into Meadow House to search for my friends, or run for the door to try to get help…and to save my cowardly ass. 

The decision was made for me when a figure appeared at the beginning of the hallway, the one nearest the door. It was a man, at least seven-feet tall, wearing a hoodie that left his face entirely in shadow. He was carrying a sledgehammer, head on the ground. The man began walking towards me, dragging the hammer. 

“The Sledgehammer Slaughter,” I said. “You’ve got to be kidding me.”

I took off in the opposite direction. I ran and ran down a series of halls that split and turned and forked across the house. It felt like I was at it for hours, though there was no way the house was anywhere near that large. Finally, out of breath and utterly lost, I stopped to lean on a faded wall. The roof above me was full of holes. I should have been able to see right up to the second floor but there was only blackness. There was no choice but to keep going.

The next hallway was different, darker, and absolutely freezing. I flicked the lighter three times before it came to life. 

“Oh, God. God above,” I whispered. 

The hallway was covered floor to ceiling with fat, black balloons. One of them twitched. 

*Ticks*.

There were two much larger shapes suspended from the ceiling. These were ticks but engorged and stuffed with…

A whimper escaped between my lips. Lex and Eddie were barely recognizable. Only their faces down to the shoulder were visible hanging out of the swollen ticks. I thought about running through the minefield of creatures on the floor to try to help them but I knew it was too late. Their faces were gaunt, so drained of blood they were nothing more than skin stretched tight over skulls. I backed away from the nightmare and retraced my steps until I came to a fork that led to a descending staircase. I took it, navigating by the flickering lighter’s flame. 

The stairs opened up on a huge, rotting basement, bare except for periodic square columns every few yards. It reminded me of a parking garage after the end of the world. There was light like in the hallways, gray but enough to see by. Someone sat slumped against the near wall. I closed the lighter and walked over carefully. 

JD was a mess. His shirt was torn and bloody. It was also stained with an oily black liquid that made me think of…shadows. He was leaning against a baseball bat propped against the floor like a walking stick. I had no idea where he found it. 

“JD?” I whispered. 

He looked at me, one eye shut by a bruise. 

“Is that you, Chris? Or another trick of the house?” 

“I, uh, either way I’d probably say I’m me, right?” 

JD laughed, voice a little gurgly. “I think it’s you. Hell of a night, huh?”

“We never should have come here,” I said, sitting next to him. “I think we’re going to die here.” 

He coughed out some blood. “Probably. You know, I’ve been thinking. Whose idea was it to come here? I know you and Tone called it but I have this hunch it came from her.” 

“It did. Does that matter, now?”

“Where is she?” 

I looked away. “The house got her.” 

“Did it? Something’s been bugging me all month, one of those flittering things, ya know? Like an eyelash caught in your eye but so close you couldn’t see it?” 

“JD, I think you might be going into shock.”

He laughed. “How long have we been coming to Meadow House to tell our stories out in the garden next to a fire?”

“This is the third year.” 

“How many stories do we tell each year?” 

“Four,” I said, not sure what he was driving at. “We always tell four.” 

“One for each Friday in October, right? One for each of us?” 

I nodded. “Exactly, four weeks, four stor-” 

It hit me like a rolling bus. JD saw the expression on my face and smiled a bloody smile. 

“You get it now, don’t you? It seems so obvious now but I think something was blocking us, keeping us from seeing what was right in front of our faces. Whatever that…fog was, I guess it went away when we entered Meadow House.” 

I didn’t respond, still trying to wrap my head around what I’d missed. Four weeks in October. Four campfire stories each year. Four scratches on the gatepost, one for each of us who were there the first night. Me. JD. Lex. Eddie. 

If you asked me before we walked into the house how well I knew Tone, I could have told you all about how we grew up together, all of the old movies we watched, how I’d had a crush on her for years. But there, sitting in that basement, all of those memories felt false, like they were someone else's. Or maybe they were more like movies than memories, fragile things projected into my head from somewhere else. 

“It was a trap,” JD coughed. “Tone led us here. She’s working with the house.” 

There was a loud *clink*, the sound of metal hitting tile. We both turned to see the Sledgehammer killer walking down the stairs. As the figure advanced, it flickered like a projector on the fritz. Then it was Tone walking towards us, smiling. She stopped a few feet away. 

“JD, you look awful,” Tone said, pursing her lips. 

He laughed. “In a few minutes, after I catch my breath, I’m going to stand up and kick your weird, spooky, monster ass.” 

Now it was her turn to laugh. “I love your energy.” Tone turned to me. “How about you, Chris? Not going down without a fight?” 

“What are you?” I whispered. 

“You’ve probably guessed by now, but my name isn’t Tone. It’s Meadow.” 

“Like the house?”

She winked. “I *am* the house, Chris. I was asleep for a long time. Then you and your friends woke me up, gave me stories to chew on, to grow on, and you all helped me shape *this*.” Tone gave a little twirl. “I based her on each of you a little bit but probably you and JD the most.”

JD snorted. “No wonder you loved her, Chris. I’m just irresistible.” 

The thing that called itself Tone chuckled. “I’ve had so much fun the last few weeks. And I’ve eaten so, *so* well. Your stories gave me life and the lives I’ve taken have given me something more. Presence? Purpose? I don’t know. But I do know I need more.” 

“Yeah, and centipedes need custom blue jeans,” JD said, trying to stand but failing. “So who cares what you want? The well is tapped, creep. We’re done telling stories.” 

Tone sighed. “I believe you.” 

She flickered again for an instant and the Sledgehammer killer was back. He swung faster than my eye could follow. There was a crunch and a crack and then Tone was back, small and smiling. Shaking, I turned to JD. His head was gone, now just a red paste on the white wall behind him. 

Tone leaned in close. “You were always my favorite, Chris. So how about you? Are you done telling stories?” 

I felt my bladder go. All I could think about was the way JD’s body ended in a smear above his neck. Tone giggled and patted my cheek. 

“Good boy. I knew I could count on you.” She pulled back and stood tall. “Now, I’ve been getting hungrier and hungrier. I need to feel real, Chris, to anchor myself. To get out of this damn, dying house. So I want you to go out into the world and I want you to tell the same story to anyone who will listen…”

That was six months ago. I’ve been homeless and drifting ever since. Some part of Meadow House is with me, I can feel it. It watches me and if I don’t do what it wants, it hurts me. That’s why I have to ask you something and I’m so very sorry, but I need to know-

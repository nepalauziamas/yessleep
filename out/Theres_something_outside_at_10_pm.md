In my town, there's a rule saying kids can't be outside past 10 pm. I always thought it was weird and my parents said, "Because of the crazy people who come out when it's late." 

I always thought it was weird but I listened to them and was always in before 10 pm. Until one night when my friend said we should sneak out and see why they don't want us out. I didn't like the idea, but he eventually persuaded me to join him.

So one night when my parents went to bed I snuck out and went to meet up with my friend. He said we should meet up at the park, but when I got there I didn't see him. 

So I sat there and waited for him, but I got a strange feeling as if someone was watching me. I looked around and saw no one, so I texted my friend to see where he was. "Where are you?" He replied saying his parents caught him sneaking out and he couldn't make it.

I was pretty bummed when I heard that, seeing I was out here by myself, I decided I should go back home. But before I left I saw someone standing over by the swings, "Hello...Are you okay?" This person was freaking me out.

I couldn't get a good look at them of how dark it was, but I could tell it was a male, probably 6'3. They weren't moving so I walked off feeling a bit nervous. I couldn't see much except for the street lights and it felt creepy, walking there by myself in the dark.

I then heard something behind me, I turn around and there was the guy from the park. He was standing below a streetlight, I still couldn't get a good look at him. He was just standing there and wouldn't move a muscle.

I could tell he was looking right at me, "What do you want?" I got no reply so I turned around and kept walking back to my place. I felt nervous seeing that guy had followed me from the park.

I was getting close to my house when I heard a scream coming from behind me, I quickly turned around to see the guy on all four crawling after me. I started running the moment I saw that. I saw my house and I was so close until something grabbed my leg and I tripped.

I turned around and what I saw freaked me out. He was human, he had no eyes and sharp teeth and he had a long tongue. I screamed trying to kick him in the face, he finally let go and ran off. I was terrified until I heard the door open behind me.

It was my dad and he grabbed my arm and pulled me into the house. He yelled at me for being out past 10 pm. I asked him what that was and he calmed down and told me to sit down. "Year's ago, a lady used to live here, and rumors spread she was a witch. And the moment a kid disappeared we blamed her and kicked her out, but before she left she said that a creature would come for our kids." 

I was pretty shocked and he said after some kids went missing the town put up a rule saying no kids out past 10 pm. Now I will always listen to that rule and make sure my kids follow it.

It all started exactly one week ago. When I decided to turn on my mosion detector camera for the first time in three whole years! I could have not done it and I wouldn't be dealing with this now. I could have done anything but that. I didnt even remember that I had it. You see I like gardening it was something of a hobby of my father that I picked up. So I have made a little garden at my backyard nothing big just enough to keep me sane now that I have retired. Now I live in the outskirts of my town, I am not right next to the forest but the animals here are confident enough to pay my crops a visit. So I bought a mosion detection camera it snaps a photo whenever something is near the sudden flash being enough to deter any would be introuder. 


The reason I stopped using it is because I got a dog his name is Sam a beautiful and loyal Labrador Retriever! Although they are consider a family dog and he rarely barks at anyone not even other dogs he seemed more than happy to chase away any wildlife from his house. I even take him to hunt deer sometimes. But after eating something he shouldn't I have left him at the house of his vet(a close friend of mine) to recover. So I turned the camera on and left it there. The next day I had 13 notifications on my phone from the camera. I checked the photos what I saw looked like some kind of kyote the only problem is the kayote don't usually come out of the forest and it also looked kind of big. It was circling the garden for sometime as it seemed. I ignored it thinking it wasnt important. I continued on with my day and forgot about it. Until the next day came when I checked my phone I had about 30 photos of that thing digging up dirt. The photo was distorted like it was moving very fast. 


When I got outside I saw my garden destroyed everything was dug up the whole was about one whole meter deep . That is when I made my first mistake after cleaning up the mess I decided to stay at the porch my backyard and take care of the problem. I wasn't going to kill it just shoot some rounds in the air to scare it. So when it got dark I took my Winchester Model 70 Featherweight Bolt-Action and waited. After about two hours  I was about to head inside when I heard the sound of leaves being crushed. I crouched rifle in hand invisible in the darkness of my porch it came closer and closer to the garden. I couldn't see it yet and then flash the light illuminated the shape shape of a man being crouched on the freshly dug dirt. 


That's when I made my second mistake I screamed for him to get out of my property the flash came again and what I saw is still burned in my memory, it only lasted one second but it was more than enough to see it. What was  in front of me was not a man it had the shape of one but it was something else. Brown four covered its body it's arms if you can call them that ended in sharp claws. It's head looked human but his mouth was open in unnatural way it's jaw practically hanging down reveling raws of sharp teeth. The image froze me to place only to be unfrozen when I heard it approaching first on four then on two legs I shot two rounds which seemed to startle it. Giving just enough time get inside and close the door behind me. I heard it bang on the door. The old wood giving away slowly if I hadn't shot I drought I would have made it. 


The rest of the night is hazy I remember going to my neighbors and calling the police my house was destroyed, I told them what happened but with no evidence other than some low quality photos they didn't belive me. The wrote a report about some animal attack and left. Sam is fine now I am leaving with my daughter now she wants to be supportive but I know she thinks I lost it. To be honest I might have. In about three days everything will be ready and I am going home. My daughter said I could stay but I don't want to worry her. I am posting this here because I really don't know what to do.

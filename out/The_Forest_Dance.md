    “I hope I’m not late for the forest dance or the feast, it’s a really big deal. My mom would kill me!” Only I could say such foolishness, she wouldn’t kill me if I missed it, she’d just be really disappointed. 

    The forest dance was held every July 3rd but I never got the chance to go. It was my celebration this year, I’m the youngest of my family to be invited. I’m 13 and I’m dying inside to know why it’s so important! Last August it was my golden birthday, I was born August 13th and the dance was held as a tradition to that. Before it was my turn, I was never allowed to know the guests attending. 

    My mom told me about how much this meant to her growing up, she wanted me to be excited. Today’s the night, the night I’ve began to dread. Of course I’m filled with excitement and curiosity but I’m terrified. My stomach sometimes turns at the thought of the night coming up. 

    I know it’s going to be exciting, I wish other children could come. I don’t understand why they can’t. It’s getting late and I’m falling tired but the traditions in just 30 minutes. “Kara honey? Are you ready, we have to leave soon.” My mom spoke softly. “Tonight you’ll become a woman, big and strong. You must be ready.” I looked at her, trying to hide my fright. “Of course mom, just give me a second.” I smiled, she smiled back lightly, closing the door. She was such a gentle woman yet brave and prepared. 

    Tonight she seemed more on edge, I hope she didn’t think I’d ruin the night or do anything stupid. I walked out of my room, wearing a sparkling green dress that went down just below my knees. We got in the car, she didn’t say a word. Tears built in her eyes, a frown smeared across her face. 

    Something was wrong and I couldn’t understand no matter how badly I wanted to. “Are you okay, is something wrong?” I asked, she looked at me for a second, “Be quiet, we’ll be there soon.” I looked down, trying to not talk even though my thoughts were eating at me. 

    We got to the forest and she grabbed her things, “Kara, tonight is your night and you will not disappoint. You can’t, I have my trust in you.” Again, I have no idea what she’s saying but I want to trust her too, I want her to trust me. We begin to walk deeper in the forest to a campfire. 

     Most of my relatives are here, I see my aunt and my grandparents. None of them live in town so this has to be even more important than I thought. “Oh Kara you look lovely, are you excited? Don’t worry if you aren’t, I am for you!” I give her a hug as I’m thinking my response, “Don’t you worry, I am. I’m brave just like mom, this is special.” My aunt squealed with excitement, “Oh yay! Let’s begin, go have this dance with Daniel.” She pointed at my cousin who I’ve only met a few times, I walked over and he smiled at me. Maybe this wouldn’t be bad, he was a child. 

    He was my age, this couldn’t harm me or anyone else. Music started to sound and our dance was nice, it was a nice bonding moment for the two of us. His smile soon faded but I assume he’s just bored or tired. The music stopped and a tiny bell rang, “Everyone may I have your attention? It’s the night we celebrate Kara and our family tradition!” I felt a hand on my back, signaling for me to walk beside my aunt who had been the announcer. 

    “It’s lovely to have you, we will begin the feast soon and the games shortly after!” I felt the joy slip from my body once again but I held my smile steady. We sat down at the large dinner table, every spot was filled. I looked around and for the most part, the faces were familiar. 

    The food tastes amazing and everyone seems happier than ever, maybe it would be a good event. 

    Once I finished I turned to my mom and asked her what would be appropriate to do until everyone else got done but instead, she stood up. “It’s time, Kara’s finished.” 

    Everyone dropped their utensils and got up from the table. I quickly turned to mom, “Mom I’m sorry I didn’t know, I wouldn’t have said anything if I knew everyone else would have to stop.” She kneeled down to me, “Honey I would’ve seen it anyway. You did the right thing.” I feel surprised, nobody was mad. “Come with me darling, it’s time for the games!” My aunt said. 

    I followed her, we played a few games and I began to enjoy it. Every game, more menacing than the next. “It’s the last game Kara, let me explain. You must avoid these eggs. If you touch them there will be consequences.” I know this, it can’t be bad. She’s said something like that every time! The game began and I soon let curiosity get the better of me, I grabbed an egg. 

    It was beautiful, I loved it. I chose to put it in my pocket, continuing. I got to the grounds we started at, winning the game. Everyone seemed relieved and happy, especially my mom until I stepped back. I fell and the egg tumbled out of my pocket and everyone stared. “Oh no.” My mom mouthed, “Oh honey, looks like you broke the rules. 

    I’m sorry but you knew there are consequences, if you would’ve just obeyed our rules you would’ve been fine. You would have gotten to marry Daniel and lead a fine life. You could’ve been okay.” My heart started to race and I began to panic. “No, what are you going to do to me?” I asked, sweat rolled down my cheek but I just felt sick. Out of no where, two men came up behind me, picking me up. 

    I screamed and it was over like that. That’s why I couldn’t know anyone who attended these events, that’s why everything was the way it was. I couldn’t escape. I was dragged to a part of the woods where I met my demise, my mom didn’t even try to help. Daniel stood over me with a frown, “I wish I could’ve known you better, as my cousin. This is a sick game but it’ll be all fine in the end. Good bye Kara.”

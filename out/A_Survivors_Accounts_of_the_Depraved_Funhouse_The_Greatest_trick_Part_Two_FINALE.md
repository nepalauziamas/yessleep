We were trapped. Nowhere to run or hide. "It's the little piggy, trying to make off with one of his [playmates!](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y6sy0t/a_survivors_accounts_of_the_depraved_funhouse_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)" said another high-pitched voice, this one clearly female. Slowly, out of reflex more than anything, I began backing the two of us back toward the black box. It was the only thing I could think to do to try and get away from the oncoming threats in front of us.

Suddenly, we were stopped when we felt something big behind us. "Well..." said the voice from behind us, deep and dementedly jovial. "If it isn't the little piggy himself. Welcome back."

My blood froze solid when I turned around to see it was Happy Bob standing right behind the two of us. "You miss us?" he asked, giggling. Despite his smile, I could see the bloodlust in his eyes, seeing the way his nose was all bent out of shape from when I'd hit him. Before I could react, he grabbed both me and Ray by our arms and said "Maybe you'd like to apologize."

"What are you talking about?" cried Ray, already struggling while I remained frozen with fear.

"Why don't you ask the little piggy yourself." chided Happy Frannie from up ahead.

"What? Linus, what're they talking about?"

"I-I don't know!" I stammered, looking back and forth between him and Happy Bob. It *was* true, at least at the moment. I really wasn't sure what they were talking about.

"Don't know?" exclaimed the other voice from ahead, the hyperactive one I knew to be none other than Jack-O. "He says he doesn't know."

"What do you want?!" I cried. By that point, I finally started joining Ray in fruitlessly trying to wrench free of Happy Bob's grasp. Out from the darkness ahead, stepped Happy Jack-O and Happy Frannie. It was here, though, that I noticed something. Particularly with Happy Jack-O.

He looked older. I know that sounds weird, but it's true. I'm honestly not sure how to really describe it other than to say that I noticed his skin seemed to look a lot more wrinkled than what I figured it should be. Not only that, I also began to notice gray spots in his hair, including his goatee. See, last time, he looked like he was maybe only in his mid-20's to early 30's. Now, though, he looked closer to 40 or even 45. I looked back to Happy Bob, noticing the same was true for him as well.

*What the hell happened?*

"What we want..." boomed another voice that shook through the entire room. I felt it reverberate throughout my body. This caused my knees to finally buckle and I was frozen once again. *([The sound of the Devil himself speaking](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/n7g6ra/a_survivors_accounts_of_the_depraved_funhouse_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf).)*

"...Is our youth, child." With this, out from the darkness stepped the Amazing Beliar himself, with Liza at his side. Like the other two, The Amazing Beliar also looked a lot older -- even more so than the others, in fact. His once pitch black hair was now almost completely gray and his face was even bonier, sicklier than it was before. Liza stood, quivering, looking scared with red makeup smeared across her eyes and mouth, dressed in a clown outfit if her own.

"Who the fuck are you people?!" cried Ray. Happy Bob twisted his arm, causing him to cry out in pain.

"Uh, uh, uh..." he said, giggling. "You need to watch your little mouth, there, bucko!" He and the other clowns then broke into a giggling fit while the Amazing Beliar just stared directly at me with a vulpine grin. I looked to Liza.

"What have you done to her?!" I screamed. He looked to her and back to me, still grinning.

"She's our new playmate!" Happy Frannie squealed excitedly. Liza looked at me again. I could tell she was crying. Her face was covered in bruises, even noticeable under the makeup.

"She will be our newest disciple." the Amazing Beliar declared. He then nodded to Happy Bob, who then tossed Ray to the ground like he was a sack of garbage.

"Disciple?!" I exclaimed. "You're fucking insane! You killed Derek and his family!"

"Such harsh words." Happy Frannie remarked, giggling. "We just had a little fun. You should've seen her, piggy. Little Happy Lizzy there was a *natural!* weren't ya, Liz?" Liza turned away and began crying.

*Happy Lizzy?!*

*"Now WE'RE gonna have some fun with her..."*

My eyes widened. "What did you freaks do to her?!" They giggled as Liza sobbed.

"They... They... They made me..." She let out an small groan of anguish and said "They made me hurt my mom!" I was confused at first, not understanding what she meant until it hit me.

The photo. Liza standing with the bat. Mrs. Cromwell's mangled body...

*"... But eventually the old bag broke!"*

"No... Liza..." She just continued bawling. The Amazing Beliar Smiled at me. "You..." I spat. "You made her do this! You're fucking *evil!"*

He stepped forward. "Evil, you say?"

"Yeah! You're the Devil, aren't you?! *YOU'RE THE FUCKING DEVIL!*" I screamed. To this, the room fell silent and the Amazing Beliar stepped towards me. He then knelt down, his face only a bare inch away from mine.

"No, boy." he said in a voice that was somehow even deeper than it had ever been before -- something I didn't figure was even possible. "I'm not the Devil." He smiled again and added, giggling dementedly, "No, *I* make the Devil smile!"

*("Always smiling, even in Hell, Linus!")*

He then turned to Liza and handed her the knife. "Now, it is time, my disciple." He put the knife in her hand. He turned then to Ray, still facedown on the floor and said, "Pledge yourself to eternal youth and happiness, child. Spill his blood for Moloch, and adorn yourself with his blood." The others then began to gasp excitedly, like they were excited to see her murder him. Liza stood there, holding the knife pointed downwards, shaking.

"Liza, don't!" I exclaimed. She looked to me. Her eyes were big, glistening. She was afraid, and I could see it. I knew she didn't want to do this, sacrifice Ray. She didn't want any of this. "Liza, don't do this!"

"I... I can't..." she whimpered. "I have to. I have to... They said they'll leave everyone else alone of I do."

"Liza, you don't have to do this, okay? You don't have to kill Ray for them!"

"But they'll hurt everyone else if I don't, even you." I won't lie, my heart sank at this. Even now, after all of this, everything *I* caused with not telling the truth -- *with trying to run away* \-- Liza was still wanting to protect me.

"Liza, don't do this, not to Ray. He's your friend. He was one of Derek's. You think he would want you to do this?" Her eyes managed to grow in shock with this. I had her now. "Liza, I'm sorry, okay? I'm a horrible friend, okay, to both you and Derek." She stood, shaking.

I let out a sharp cry of pain as I felt Happy Bob pin my arms back behind me. "I think you better put a sock in it, piggy!" he said, with a giggle.

"Yeah, piggy, put a sock in it, or else we'll just have to cut your little tongue out!" Happy Frannie chimed in as she pulled out a switchblade from the pocket of her overalls and skipped over to where I was. I felt her fingers reach inside my mouth and begin prying my mouth open and sticking the blade in. Because of the way Happy Bob had my arms, I was unable to reel away from her or the blade.

"Stop!" cried Liza. "You said you wouldn't hurt him!"

"Enough, sister," the Amazing Beliar bellowed. The boy is no threat to us, so long as he sees this. Sees what happens when the ceremony of youth is interrupted. Now, my child, let us commence." He turned again to face Liza. Liza looked back at him, almost in a pleading manner, before looking down at Ray.

Ray tried to scramble to his feet to run before his arms and legs were seized by Happy Jack-O and Happy Frannie. "Come on, Happy Liz!" Happy Jack-O exclaimed excitedly.

"Yeah, come on, sis, you can do it!" Happy Frannie cheered. I tried to wrestle free as Liza came closer, pointing the knife once again downward at Ray. Ray's face was chiseled in perpetual terror.

"W-Wait, what're you doing?!" I heard him cry out, fruitlessly writhing against the clowns' holds. Liza slowly came closer and closer. She stopped when she stood right over him.

"Say it, child!" the Amazing Beliar urged.

In a small, shaking voice, Liza began. "U-Un-Unto thee in the burning lake beneath..."

"Liza, NO!" I screamed. I kicked and flailed as much as I was capable at that moment. It did me no good, however.

"Can it, piggy!" screeched Happy Jack-O.

"Come on, Liz, make us all proud!" Happy Frannie cheered. Liza raised up the blade, hands shaking.

"I-I, y-y-your servant, offer unto thee this offering. I-I o-o-o-only a-ask in r-return for the eternal youth a-and happiness o-of myself and m-my disciples." She then knelt down to Ray, still shakily poising the blade high in the air. Ray was quivering, no longer able to even try wrestling free anymore.

"Please don't. I don't wanna die! I wanna go home!" he blubbered, staring into Liza's equally frightened eyes. Liza began breathing heavily.

"Good, now do it, child!" commanded the Amazing Beliar. She held the knife high. I saw her hesitating to bring the blade down.

"Liza, don't do it!" I pleaded. The Amazing Beliar exchanged a glare back and forth between me and her. She looked up him again. It was almost like I could actually hear her begging for him to not make her do this, despite only looking into her fearful, innocent blue eyes.

"Do it!" he barked, his voice echoing all around us. She looked back down to Ray, eyes flooding with tears.

"I'm sorry..." I heard her murmur as she closed her eyes. I watched her bring the knife down before turning away myself. I could hear the squelch of flesh being penetrated, but was instantly shocked when I realized I couldn't hear Ray screaming in pain. I was in for an even bigger shock when I then turned back around to see that it wasn't Ray at all who'd been stabbed. Instead, it was Happy Jack-O.

She'd managed to embed the blade all the way to the hilt in his neck. Happy Jack-O began to seize up, violently convulsing and gasping desperately for breath. "What are you doing?!" exclaimed the Amazing Beliar. He made a move to seize her but she, in one fluid motion, drew the blade back out of Happy Jack-O, causing him to collapse, writhing in agony on the floor, and drove it then into his leg. The Amazing Beliar clutched his leg, roaring in both anger and pain.

I felt Happy Bob release his hold on my arms before then moving in on Liza himself. "Liza, watch out!" I cried. She tried to swing the blade at him, but he caught her hand and twisted it, forcing her to drop the blade before hurling her to the floor like he did Ray. He began to stomp towards her. Seeing the blade land not far away from me, I attempted to run and grab it, only to be cut off when a deliriously enraged Happy Frannie ambushed me from my left, tackling me and pinning me to the floor. "Oh, and where do you think *YOU'RE* going, piggy?!" she shrieked.

I felt her fingers wrap like ball pythons around my throat, trying to crush it. No matter how desperately I clawed at her face, I couldn't make her let go. It wasn't long, either, before her face started to blur in my vision. Fortunately, though, she wasn't so concerned with whether or not I was restrained completely because I managed to muster up enough strength to bring my feet up and under her stomach and shove her off of me. Surprising still was the fact that I'd managed to actually hurl her into the wall just half a foot behind her.

I quickly recovered to my feet and made a break for Happy Bob. When I caught up to the two of them, I found that he had Liza cornered. "You've been a naughty little one, ain't ya, Lizzy?" he said, giggling insanely. I crept up from behind him, pulling out the blade. He stepped forward to grab Liza. Liza tried to back up further, but was stopped by the wall behind her. "Sorry, Liz, looks like there's no place else to run along to, is the--"

Before he could finish, before he could grab and try to crush Liza with his bare hands, I bounded up and drove the blade right into Happy Bob's jugular. Like with Happy Jack-O, Happy Bob also began to wheeze desperately while rolling on the floor in agony. "Liza, quick! Run, get Ray and get out of here!"

She nodded before scurrying away. Looking down, I saw that, despite the major blood loss, Happy Bob was actually still trying to get back on his feet. *Holy shit! How is this even possible!*

Not willing to take any risks, I raised the blade high in the air again and proceeded to repeatedly stab Happy Bob, creating a bigger and bigger mess of blood splatter that was starting to spray all across the front of me. Finally, his attempts slowly became weaker and weaker until eventually the only movements of his body were the twitching of his arms and legs. Then he stopped moving altogether.

I then made a break for the direction Liza and Ray ran toward when I was once again caught and thrown to the ground by Happy Frannie. Looking back into her eyes, They were wide, bloodshot, and wild. They were the eyes you'd see in a feral animal. She twitched violently as she stomped toward me. I quickly rolled away as her foot attempted to come down right where my face was.

I started to book it again, running into the mirror maze. I'd hoped I could lose her there, possibly catching up with Liza and Ray along the way. Like before, I couldn't tell just how deep I was going into the maze. It didn't really matter -- not then, anyways. The only thing that really mattered to me in that moment was making it out of there with my life.

As before, it was difficult for me to see anything or anywhere I was going. The lights decorating the mirror walls were dim, and with as clear, yet oblong shaped as the borders were -- not to mention just the sheer intensity of the situation itself flaring up at me, distorting my concentration -- and it wouldn't be hard to see why I say that I was in trouble here. Then the lights suddenly shut off completely.

I froze. about two seconds later, I heard the sounds of a backup generator kicking in and the room went red. "So you wanna play hide-n'-go-seek, piggy?" I heard Happy Frannie's voice echo from seemingly every direction around me. I couldn't move.

*Where is she? Where's she coming from?*

"That's cool, I like this game, Hehehe!" Her echoed giggling made my heart jump worse than if I'd heard a cannon blast. I started looking around.

*Where's the exit?!* As panic quickly began building up from the pit of my stomach, I heard the sound of a resounding *crash*, followed by the scattering of glass shards. "Little pig, little pig, come on out..." I heard coming from my right. That kicked me into high gear and I broke into a sprint to my left. That was until I heard another *crash* sounding from a little way up ahead of me.

*What the fuck?! How did she... She was just behind me, how the hell did she break one from over there?!*

*Crash*

This one came from directly beside me at the left of where I was currently standing. Somehow, she was everywhere at once, like she was a ghost. I was trapped. There was nowhere I could run. Nowhere I could hide.

"All around the HappyWorld," I heard her begin to sing. This was followed by the smashing of a mirror at my left. I swung my head to look, but I couldn't see her.

"Frannie chased the piggy..."

*Crash*

This one came from behind me. I spun around to look. Nothing.

*Oh God, where the fuck is she?!*

"Piggy ran through the maze..."

*Crash*

This one was in front of me. She wasn't there.

*Crash*

This one came from the corner between the area to the front and to my right. I did the only thing I figured I could do and raised the knife I still had as defensively as I could manage.

*Crash*

This one was from the left of me again. *Fuck, I can't see her! Where is she?!* I couldn't help my knees from starting to buckle. This was only made worse when I heard her giggling echo throughout the room again.

*Crash, crash, crash*

I was spinning in circles. My heart was racing madly, on the verge of giving out. I couldn't see her, I couldn't see anything around me.

*Oh God, what am I gonna do?! I'm gonna die! She's gonna get to me and I'm gonna die!*

\*\*\*

*"Smile with us Linus..."*

*"Smile for Satan, Linus..."*

*Go away! Get away from me!*

*"Smile forever, Linus!"*

*"We're always happy down here, Linus!"*

*("Now you can be, too!")*

*NOOOO!*

*\*\*\**

I was jolted from my trance when I felt a hand on my shoulder, shaking me. *Fuck, she's got me!* Out of sheer animal reflex, I thrusted the blade in the direction of where the hands came from. I didn't even see where the knife was going, having closed my eyes as I did this. I only opened them again when I felt the knife penetrate flesh, only to be faced with an even bigger horror.

It was no clown I'd stabbed. It was... It was...

*"A little piggy and his playmate..."*

It was...

*"I'm this dork-lord's sister..."*

*(Oh Jesus, I'm sorry...)*

It was Liza! She looked at me, her face frozen in confusion and horror as she desperately gasped for breath. I could only stare back, jaw hanging limp. Blood began running freely from the middle of her chest and every joint in my body just locked up.

*Oh God... Oh fuck, oh God, no, no, no, no, no...*

"L-L-L-Liza?!" I stammered. She could only reply with gasps and wheezes. Despite this, her eyes spoke for her. I could almost her it, her small voice, begging *"Why, Linus?"*

"Liza! Oh God, Liza, no! No, no, no, stay with me!" I pulled the blade out and began trying to cover the wound to stop the bleeding. It was obviously no use, though. Blood ran right through the cracks between my fingers in rivers. She began convulsing violently, her eyes bulging more and more as she gasped harder and harder for air *(Just like her brother).*

*"LIZA!"* I began to crumble into a meltdown as her body eventually relaxed again. She finally went limp and I watched her eyes glaze over. It was all over now.

"Oh my God, dude, what happened?!" I heard from up ahead. I looked up to see Ray, standing in front of me, an expression of utter shock on his face.

From ahead, I could hear multiple footsteps stomping towards us, followed by multiple voices shouting "Go around the back!" A few seconds later, I saw multiple police officers emerge from the space ahead. And like Ray, they, too were met with the sight of me huddling and sobbing over the lifeless body of Liza Cromwell, her blood on my hands.

*(Just. Like. Derek's.)*

I was escorted out of HappyWorld soon after that. As I was led to the police cruiser, all I could do was cry. It was over. Everything was over for me now.

My life would be over, even if I wasn't dead yet.

I remember wondering what would happen to me. I wondered if I'd be put in juvie or if they'd just skip that and send me straight to prison. I mean, I figured they'd not go *that* far, given that I was only twelve. But at the same time... I'd *killed* someone!

*No... No, it-it was an accident! The clown, you were trying to protect yourself from the clown! It was the clowns...*

*It was the clowns...*

For at least the past thirty or so years, those words have repeated like a broken record in my head. It was what I told the police when I was questioned immediately following the incident. It was what I'd tell the courts three months later when I'd stand trial. It's what I've always told the doctors and the shrinks here at the institution after I was deemed mentally insane and was sentenced originally to 10 months in psychiatric care, which then became 12 months. Then 24. then 36.

Eventually, it became clear that I wouldn't be leaving any time before I was already a grown man. Not as long as I still thought of them. As long as I still held to the belief that the clowns were the ones responsible. No one's ever believed me about them. Thing was, when they found me that morning in HappyWorld, having been called by my mother who'd reported my disappearance, they *only* found me. No one found where the clowns had gone.

Let me rephrase, I said that no one believed me about the clowns -- which is mostly true -- except for Ray, of course. I know he believed my story. Except that you wouldn't have known that if you'd seen him at the trial. That's right, he hung me out to dry, claiming I'd been the one who'd set the whole thing up -- even so far as to say that I'd had an "unknown accomplice" to take pictures of Liza and kidnap the two of them. Why he said this, I honestly couldn't tell you, except maybe to keep himself from being thrown in the nuthouse along with me.

As much as what he did costed me, I don't hate him. It's not like I was *really* any better, was I? I'd watched my friend get murdered, and then, just because I was afraid of not being believed, I kept my mouth shut about it. In turn, denying the Cromwells any real closure as well as making them targets. Because of me, an entire family is now gone.

*("It was the clowns...")*

This is it. This is where my story ends. I don't think it'll give me any "Catharsis" or whatever, but it's done. That was the last time I'd ever see "The home of Everlasting Smiles". It would also, just a year or two later, can't really remember when, be the last time I'd see my mother or father. They stopped coming to visit. Like with Ray, I guess I can't necessarily blame them, either. They deserve to forget about me, about their psycho-killer son.

*("It was the clowns...")*

Me, well... I don't think I'll be able to get over this. At least, not as long as I can still remember what happened. But, just like I did back then, I want to forget. I don't want to remember HappyWorld anymore. I want to be done with it. *To finally run away from it.*

I'm going to be meeting with my psychiatrist again soon and when I do, it'll be to discuss the possibility of using electro-shock treatment. It may be possible for me yet to be rid of this. I'm going to leave this as a way of saying that it was my fault, but I wasn't a monster.

Those clowns, The Amazing Beliar and his satanic jesters, they're real. They're still out there, too. They may not operate in HappyWorld anymore, as the site itself was bulldozed last year (I think they even converted it into a vacant parking lot), but they're still out there, somewhere. I'm hoping, though not expecting, that someone will believe me here.

That way, at least The Amazing Beliar, the Devil ringmaster himself, won't have fully pulled off his greatest trick: convincing the world that he doesn't exist.

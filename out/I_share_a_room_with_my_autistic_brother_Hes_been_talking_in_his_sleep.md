A lot of autistic children are difficult to handle, but my brother Lucas isn’t one of them. His 16 years on this earth have not inconvenienced my family in the least. In fact, I can say that of all the autistic kids I’ve met, Lucas is the sweetest and gentlest. I’m not just saying that because he’s family; neighbors, teachers, and friends constantly note his calm disposition with surprise.
 
Up until lately, he’s never talked much. He spends hours on the phone with his best friend, an autistic classmate named Alex, and doesn’t say anything but “Hi, Alex,” and “Bye, Alex.” He’s content to spend all day sitting in his banana chair and playing PlayStation. Getting him to leave his room for any reason is like pulling teeth—unless, of course, we lure him with Doritos and Nutter Butters. 

He really is the greatest kid. That’s why I’m so worried about him.

Over the past month, Lucas has talked more and more, but not while he’s awake. No, during the daytime, it’s pretty much business as usual. But at night, business has become very strange indeed. See, though Lucas is a teenager, he’s got the mental stature of a toddler. He says things a toddler would say, acts the way a toddler would act, and enjoys things that a toddler would enjoy. We’ve grown accustomed to this; for instance, if he wants a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, he’ll say “milk and sandwich” and we all know what he means. He does not speak in complete sentences, and he does not have a large vocabulary—which is why I’ve been so unnerved by the things he says in his sleep.

Lucas has never been a sleep-talker—I would know, I’ve shared a room with him his entire life. So when I awoke many nights ago to the sound of him babbling away from the bunk below mine, I paid attention. 

The first thing I noticed was that his voice sounded different; my first thought was that somebody else was in our room. I almost would have preferred that. What I heard that night—and many nights since—was undoubtedly Lucas’s voice, but sharper, clearer, somehow more intelligent. Honestly, it’s how I think his voice would sound if he were not autistic. 

The second thing I noticed is what he said. “Hi, have we met?” Over and over again. Once every thirty seconds or so. It reminded me of something Lucas used to do in his childhood. He’d put in a movie, lie down next to the VCR and prop his feet up against it; then, he’d use his toes to rewind the most amusing scenes. Over and over again.

The third thing I noticed is how he said it. He wasn’t just saying words, he was *meaning* them. The diction, the intonation—it sounded for all the world as though he were actually speaking to someone. “Hi” was bright and cheerful, the tone employed by perpetually happy people all over the world. Then, a pause. Hesitating. “Have we met?” Still upbeat, but with a hint of confusion. Maybe even trepidation.

I said Lucas’s name, quietly at first, and then louder. He didn’t respond. I hopped off the bed and used the light from my phone to look at him. He appeared to be both fully asleep and fully alert. He was lying down, yes, and his eyes were closed—but he somehow looked awake, attentive. He was on his back, flat as a board, his legs straight and his arms at his sides. His face pointed straight up toward the bunk board, his eyes dancing behind their lids and his mouth turned up in a small smile. I was about to go back to bed when his facial expression changed.

His smirk dissolved into a grimace. His face, once relaxed, was now scrunched and his eyes shut tight. He started to breathe more heavily, and I noticed a light shimmer of sweat beginning to appear on his forehead. I tried to shake him awake, but he wouldn’t budge. His muscles looked so tense that I wondered if I should wake our parents. I decided against it, partly because I don’t get along with our parents, and partly because I was getting freaked out and just wanted to sleep.

I scrambled back into bed a little too quickly for a 17-year-old guy. Just as I had relaxed and started to drift off, I heard Lucas’s voice once more—this time a whisper, scared and helpless. “No. Please.”

I couldn’t get back to sleep that night.

Things were normal the next day. Lucas played video games, watched Teletubbies, and paced around our room. If anything was wrong, he didn’t know it. I even interrupted Star Wars Battlefront II and asked him—“Luke, did you sleep good last night?”—but he just nodded. “Yeah?” I said, and he replied with an affirmative “sleep good,” his eyes never leaving the screen. Then he started making the whale noises from Finding Nemo. Like I said, things were normal.

I suppose I’m not sure how often he’s talked in his sleep, but the next time it woke me up was a week later. It was *loud.* My parents sleep upstairs, so they didn’t hear it, but they certainly would have if they were on our level. 

He was crying.

“What are you—what do you want with me?” he asked through sobs. He sniffled, then louder: *“What do you want?!”* I hopped out of bed immediately and turned on the light. He was asleep, but his face was twisted even more grotesquely than it had been a week before. Tears rolled down his cheeks and soaked the pillow. I said his name forcefully, and even shook him, but he wouldn’t wake.

I realized that rocky relationship aside, I needed to get my parents. I bolted out of my bedroom, then stopped in my tracks about halfway down the hall. He was saying something new. I heard it more and more clearly as I retreated back into the room, overwhelmed by curiosity.

“Hello? Hello?! Oh, thank God.” He sounded frightened for his life, and he was gasping, as though he were running from something. “I’m in trouble. My name is Anna Madsen, Annabeth Madsen, I need help. I need help.” 

My stomach dropped, because Annabeth Madsen is my girlfriend.

A brief pause, then: “There’s a man, he’s after me, someone, someone stopped him but I think he’s following me, I hear him, I’m just running—“ another pause, and a hysterical sob.

“I’m, um, wait,” Lucas continued, my girlfriend’s words coming from his mouth. “The parking lot, the church, Baptist church, south of State Street, but wait, wait—"

I looked on at Lucas in disbelief, too stunned to even worry about Anna. “I’m running, I’m already past the parking lot, oh, God, I don’t know where he is, help, help!”

At this, I snapped back to reality. “Mom! Dad!” I roared. Louder. “MOM! DAD! HELP!”

“I think I can hear him still, it’s too dark, I can’t see him, I don’t even know how I got here,” Lucas sobbed, still lying flat and facing the bunk board, not moving a muscle. My parents burst into the room, terrified looks on their faces. They looked at Lucas. “What in God’s name—“ my dad began, but was interrupted by more from Lucas.

“No, no, I am, I’m turning left! I’m—I can see Starbucks, and the gas station, and—no, no, I see him! I see his lights! Hey! HEYYYYY! HELP! HEYYYYY!” Lucas was now screaming at the top of his lungs. My mother was screaming too, trying to shake him awake. But then his face started to relax, and his voice at once became more relieved. “Oh, thank God, thank you, thank you,” he sobbed. Then he was quiet.

That was everything he said, word for word. I’m able to remember it so exactly because the next morning, I listened to Anna’s 911 call at the police station. The voice in the call was Anna’s, but apart from that, I was listening to an echo.

When Lucas stopped talking that night, I dialed Anna with shaking hands. No answer. I sent her a text at 2:44—“hey this is gonna sound weird but are you alright? Call me. Sorry I’ll explain”—and got this reply at 2:47: “Not really, I’ll call give me a few minutes.” 26 agonizing minutes later, my phone rang.

I listened to her story. A little after 2:00 in the morning she found herself in a hoodie and her pajama bottoms, barefoot, on an old dirt road near the industrial district (it’s a small town, we still have a few unpaved streets). She didn’t remember how she got there, but her feet were dirty, and she realized she must have walked. She knew where she was from the street signs, and found that she had her phone in the pocket of her hoodie. Panicking, she pulled it out to call someone—me, in fact—and she was struck, hard, in the back. She fell to the ground, scrambled to a sitting position, and turned her phone toward her attacker. He wore gym shorts and a hooded sweatshirt, and his face was too shadowed to see clearly. She tried to get up, and he grabbed her by the shoulders and threw her to the ground. They struggled for a few minutes, and she was badly beaten—the only shot she was able to get in was to viciously claw his leg with her long fingernails. Some of his skin and blood remained on her fingers when the police brought her in, the only evidence she was able to provide of her attacker. 

Just as she was nearing collapse from exhaustion, another man emerged from the shadows. At first, she thought he was with her attacker, but her attacker recoiled when he saw the stranger. She said he looked scared. The mystery man ran full speed at her assailant, who promptly released her and took off. The man caught up to her attacker about fifty feet away and tackled him to the ground. That’s when she ran. She called the police, sprinting barefoot through the town until she saw the police officer pulling out of the gas station parking lot. She entered his custody bruised, bleeding, the soles of her feet practically torn to shreds. 

At the end of Anna’s story, she asked how I knew she was in trouble. I told her about Lucas. She gave the phone to the police officer, and I related what my brother had said to him as well. He asked me and my parents to come to the station in the morning and make a statement.

So, the next morning, my parents took both of us to the station. When we got there, there was a split-second when Lucas (who was completely normal when he woke up, albeit very tired) and Anna looked at each other. Their eyes met, locked on one another’s, and as soon as the moment began, it was gone.

We made our statements, then asked the befuddled police officer, “Now what?”

“Now—” he began, pausing as if wondering the same thing himself—“uh, you can go.” It sounded more like a question.

This is just the beginning of my story, and I’ll type more of it tomorrow. But before I log off, I want to leave you with something Anna said to me later that same night. See, she was still needed at the station after I left, but she came to my place when they let her go. She looked awful. We talked about the police—whether they had a case. She said there wasn’t much of her attacker’s blood and skin left under her nails, but that they were sending what they could salvage to a lab for DNA testing. In the meantime, due to her lack of description there wasn’t a lot they could do other than put the word out, you know, tell folks to be careful.

She said the police questioned her about her savior as well, but she could provide them with no helpful description. Her eyes hadn’t seen much. Her mind, though, had a pretty good idea. “This is going to sound crazy,” she said, “But I know who it was. I know who saved me.”

All at once, the whole crazy situation came together for me. She didn’t even need to say—

“It was Lucas.”

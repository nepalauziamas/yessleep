When I was small, I always saw a door at home that wasn't actually there. Well, I used to see it, but no one believed me because it disappeared immediately. I remember bits and pieces - of the door repeatedly appearing and disappearing on our grey wall - half broken memories, like remnants of a long dream. I badly wanted to go in, but I knew my mother would kill me. One night though, my father came back through that door. 

I always used to sleep on my bed in a way in which I could see straight through the corridor to see if the door was there. We didn't have a big house, so that was easy. For everyone else, it was just a grey wall, so it was useless trying to explain what I saw. However, late one night, I saw my father come out of the door and he shut it behind him. Of course, I didn't know it was my father. I had never seen him before, and I would have been around six or seven. He came to me, held me close, and started crying. My mother walked in, saw him, and started crying too. She slapped him, shook him, and the door was gone. They fought for hours, for days. In the next few months, we got to hang out a lot, but he never really felt like he was trying to be a part of his family. He was always strangely distant, but overtly loving. The neighbours were in shock as well and there were continuous rumours about where he had gone off to. Of course, he didn't bother telling anyone about the door either. I think a year passed by. One night, I woke up to see that the door was back. I saw my father go in. He looked at me and smiled. He didn't have anything to smile about. He put his finger to his mouth, signaling me to be quiet. Then he shut the door behind him and disappeared forever. My mother was heartbroken - I wasn't. It seemed like a distant dream even then, even now. Even when I told her about the door, she wept through it and didn't believe a word I said. I think she had started dying inside a long time ago. 

I had already married by the time my mother was in her deathbed. She never left the house; I left it the moment I could. I didn't want to be a part of it. We lived in a small village in Karnataka called Gangara, and I moved to Mumbai for work. I got myself a different life. When my aunt called me about my mother, I decided to move back in for a few months, but I didn't live at the house. After she passed away, I shut the house up for good. It was only several years later, when my daughter was big enough to travel, that the question of going back to the house, renovating it and selling it off came about. My aunt had the keys and so my daughter and I went to Karnataka. It looked haunted and messed up, badly in need of repair. I kept my kid at my aunt's and went in, taking in the mulchy air of dust and cockroaches. 

The door was there. Right on the grey wall, as if it always had been there. 

I hadn't even remembered it all these years. All of that had become a bad dream that probably never happened, but there it was. Bright and untouched by age. I couldn't help it, I wanted to look at the other side as badly as if I was thirsty and hadn't had water for days. Even if all the signals in my head were blaring and red against it, I couldn't help it. 

I opened the door and walked in to a room that was considerably hotter. There was an old woman vaguely resembling my mother, who was napping on a dusty old sofa. I quickly looked behind myself, the grey wall was there, but no door. I panicked and something fell. The woman woke up with a start, shocked at an intruder she didn't recognise. After she put on her glasses, she peered at me and let out a scream. A man who was presumably her husband, and another male relative, ran in and cornered me. Then the husband sat down in shock and the woman cried uncontrollably. 

"*It's him.*", said the third male relative. 

"*That's impossible*", said the husband, crashing down on the sofa in disbelief. 

The woman cradled my face in her hands. 

"*Where did you come from? How did you come here? Do you recognise us, son?*" 

I gulped and I sat down on the floor. No one would believe me here either. 

"*It's impossible*", the old husband repeated. "*Is this some joke*?"

The woman glared at him. "*Don't you dare, don't you DARE open your mouth about him. He has come back to us. He has come back to us now.* " She hugged me and the male relative (her brother) offered me water. I stared at the wall in disbelief. 

They called a priest to bless me. He looked at me, grateful, and smiled. "*Ah, the child who disappeared into thin air. And now, comes back from thin air. The Lord, indeed, works in mysterious ways.*" They held a traditional ceremony, inviting people from nearby houses who all stared at me in disbelief and just talked among themselves. An elderly woman told me how she remembered me as a child and how I bore the same uncanny resemblance. An old journalist came, he kept taking pictures of me and screaming, "*I KNEW YOU WHEN YOU WERE A KID, SON!*" Through the priest's prayers, I stared at everything, everyone in disbelief. It was as if I had walked into a movie set, a film about someone else's life. I wanted to run and break the grey wall, search for the door and go the hell back to my life. This WAS the village of my house, the same address: Gangara, Karnataka, India - but it was a different world. It was as if I was erased out of existence, then forcefully pushed back to be someone else. 

I didn't sleep for many days. The old woman kept showing me things from my childhood that she had lovingly kept - toys, books, things I had written - which were, by the way, all in my handwriting. Every single night, I slept on the sofa in front of the grey wall, waiting - praying, for the door to appear. I wasn't even hungry, I just wanted this dream to pass away. 

One night, the old man came to me and asked me to walk with him. We went to a small country liquor shop where people drank their hooch on small cots under the sky, rambling among themselves. When we walked in, a lot of people recognised us. We sat on a cot and out came two glasses. The old man drank away and said nothing for a while. 

"*When we lost you-*" he suddenly said -"*you were playing in the house. You disappeared into thin air. We searched for days. The police searched the jungle, other houses. We put out posters. You were on the news. I spent a long, long time searching for you. Our life ended after you were gone, son. But somehow, we built it back. Somehow, we mended it."*

He waited for me to reply, but I had nothing to say.  

After a while, he looked at me and asked, "*Tell me what you were doing all this while. Were you kidnapped? Did you lose your memory? I have a lot of questions, because it's not easy for me to believe that my son is suddenly back after twenty years. Your mother will believe anything. It's not easy for me to believe this.*"

*"If I were to tell you that it is even more difficult for me to believe any of this, would you believe me? Even if I said what I had to say, would you believe me? So why ask?"*

He was silent. He stared into the air. 

I continued. "*My life is gone too. I have never seen any of you before. I don't even know what is going on. I walked through a door - a door in my old house, on the grey wall - and then I suddenly stood before all of you, in front of the sofa. My life disappeared in front of my hands. This is like a dream to me. Is there anything hidden behind the grey wall in front of the sofa? Is there a door?*" 

He looked at me with shock, with eyes of pity, as if he had just rescued me from a mental asylum. 

"*I don't have anything to say. I don't have anything to believe anymore.*", was all he could muster. 

It was at that moment that I made my mind: whatever happened, I would wait in front of the wall until I saw a door. I didn't care if these people believed me, I didn't care if they thought I was insane. Hell, I didn't even care if I believed myself. I missed my wife and my daughter. I wanted my life. 

No one talked much to me as I spent most of my life on the sofa. Of course, we went to doctors who chalked it down to a combination of abuse and amnesia. I travelled to Mumbai to search for my wife and daughter, I travelled throughout India, I searched on the net like a maniac. Nope. That life I lost was behind that door I had lost as well. 

Days passed into months and I think after a while, they gave up on me. I mean, I just appeared into their lives and they had already lost me, or a version of me, so long ago. They didn't know what to do with me.  I worked menial jobs and freelanced on a computer near the sofa to make whatever money I could make, but I didn't let the grey wall out of my sight. I grew thin and loose and desperate, to the point that these once-overjoyed people simply saw me as a thing that could have once been rescued, but now was just swimming in its own ashes. 

One night, as I woke up, the door was there. The door was there, bright and unaged, right on the grey wall. Electricity shivered through my body. I took a good, long look at this house and this place. I felt really, really sorry for them. But I didn't have time. I opened the door and I walked in. 

To a dirt heap. I could barely breathe. I was lost under mounds and mounds of dust. My immediate thought was that this was how I was going to die, because I had probably landed at the bottom of the Earth. Taking in heaps of dirt and mud, I dug my way up, clawing for every square inch of breathable air. It probably took hours or it took minutes, I have no idea. 

When I came out of the ground, my house was long gone. This was a construction site, but I recognised that I was back. There were little signs everywhere that this was where the house used to be. I rushed to Mumbai to search for my wife and daughter. 

Even though someone else was living in my Mumbai home, they told me that my daughter worked as a nurse. A nurse? How old had she become? They were quite alarmed, though. They told me that my daughter and wife had searched me for years. Years? How long had it been for me there? How long was I gone? 

I waited in the hospital for my daughter's shift to get over. When she saw me, I cried out. She didn't really look like my daughter. At least who I once knew. So much older. She looked at me with anger, with hate. She didn't even want to sit next to me.

When we walked out of the hospital, she asked me to go away. We sat on a park bench. For the hundredth time in my life, I knew that she wouldn't believe me even if I tried to explain it all. Why the hell did only my father and I see this door? 

When I tried to hold her, she pushed me back as if I was a stranger. 

"*You left us that day. You took me on a trip to get your house sorted, and you disappeared. For good. Forever. Mother and I searched for you for ages. We went on the news. We got the police. We wondered if you had died somewhere. She took multiple jobs. I couldn't even finish school. She died working. She tried so much to take care of us. It was very hard. It was very, very hard...*" and she burst into tears, but she didn't let me hold her. 

After she stopped crying, she said, "*Every day has been a nightmare. Every single day. And you weren't there. Now, you come back from thin air as if nothing has changed. Where the hell were you? And what do you want from me? Look, I'm happier now. At least slightly. I'm married. You don't even look like my father and yet here we are. I'm doing okay. Please...*"

She clutched my hands. 

"*Please, whether you used to be him or even if you are not, I don't know what you're doing here and please, just... go. Please, just go. If you need money, if you need help, just tell me. I'll help you, but I don't want to know you. I'm doing good now, after all this while. And I sincerely hope and pray, to God, that you will do good too. But not with me."* 

She clutched my hands, and then she begged me with folded hands to let her go. 

So I got up from that bench and I walked away. I cried for hours, for days, but it was okay. 

Then I got back to the construction site. To where my house used to be. 

I paid them to dig underground and go back to the grey wall where the door used to appear. Then I paid them whatever I had left to back the hell off and leave me alone. They found the grey wall. Underneath piles and piles of dust and mud. So I got a chair and I sat in front of it, the wall, waiting for the door. Maybe to go back. Maybe to go anywhere. The construction workers got tired of me, so they called the police and I explained the situation and I begged and I pleaded, so now they have rounded me out in a yellow circle. The construction workers laugh at me and people come and take a look. I sit here, staring at my grey wall, while they do whatever the hell they're doing around me. 

I'm waiting for the door.

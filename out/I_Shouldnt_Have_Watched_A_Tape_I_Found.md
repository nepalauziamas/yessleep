This is bit of a weird story and I wasn't sure how to deal with it so I wanted to write all my experiences down to try and make sense of it. 

It was early October and I was exploring the deeper parts of the forest I lived in. 

I didn't really have a reason to do it other then a bored mind and found myself walking in a random direction to see where I end up. 

I walked for hours, content with the wandering wilds I put myself in. I thought I knew the forest pretty well but I ended up getting lost. 

Stocked with provisions for about two days and warm clothing I wasn't overly concerned and eventually found some abandoned farm. My curiosity got the best of me and I scoped out the place. There were no people or animals but remnants of crop lines engraved the ground with the machinery surrounding it old and rusted. 

Broken silos, stables that have been  rotted away, a barn on the far side and a small house which sat in the middle of the dilapidated farm. 

I knew I shouldn't have gone into these structures but I couldn't resist. With the guilty excitement of an urban explorer I pressed on. 

I passed through the now dead and molding crops, the plants didn't seem to die from negligence as the soil looked moist and healthy. The smell however, reeked of a sour rot coming directly from the ground. 

The stables, with upon closer inspection, were burned down. Rummaging through the charred debris I found horse-shoes, old nails and unlabeled bottles, nothing of note. 

Couldn't get into the silos so no luck there. The house seemed boarded up as well and I didn't want to break too many laws in one day. With just the barn left I inspected the outside and found the large doors wouldn't budge. The side door was unlocked though and with a rusted creak it opened with a hard pull.  

I felt a wave of relief when I confirmed no one was in there and started to look around, a very rusted and old truck sat in the middle. Workbenches, parts and tack gear sat against the walls while more old jars and other debris lay on the floor.  Cages could be seen in the hay loft, some big enough for a large animal to fit in. 

No owners of the items have been there for a long time but the things remained there untouched by outside hands. 

I found a bunch of old televisions that were broken, tossed into a pile after it's purpose was served. Some were the ones with VHS players built into them but nothing else could be found and the smell coming from them kept me at arms distance. 

As the wind blew through a broken window I noticed a large crate covered by an old piece of canvas that scraped against it as the breeze pushed it. Concerned, I looked through the window to make sure I was still alone before I approached the crate. Safe. 

I ripped off the canvas in one pull and worked to open the crate which was fairly easy after jimmying the top lid with an old pipe that was discarded. 

Looking back at this experience now I am still not sure how to deal with what I found. 

Over 12 full jars of a clear liquid, a few notebooks, an old VHS tape and a red tinted container which appeared to be full of some kind of meat but the liquid it marinated in was too dark to see inside. 

I took the VHS tape, the notebooks and one of the jars and decided this was enough for my urban exploration itch and left.

The next day, I decided to investigate my treasure and I started with the jar of liquid. Stored in a mason jar, the liquid had a very strong chemical odor and burned my nostrils and eyes when I went to smell it. I'm not sure if it was just the pungent chemicals but it made me feel immediately nasueas and I had to gather myself or I would pass out. I thought this was weird but farmers need all sorts of chemicals so I thought nothing of it.

The notebook however held a darker secret. Looking through the pages there were many scrawlings of animals with no eyes, some caged, others lie lifeless. One drawing showed a deer that was trapped and being forced to drink something.

The jars.

At this point I knew something was very wrong but chalked it up to the musings of a demented farmers child as the drawings weren't very detailed.

Even more creepy, I thought. I guess that is what I asked for when snooping on others property. Morbid curiosity got the best of me and I bought an old VHS player from the thrift store and hooked it up to my TV.

Static

Checking the VHS was fully rewound before playing it I pushed in the tape and the screen went dark for a few moments and then the screen lit up with an image of stables, with the camera set up on the far end. Five horses stood in their respective stall, content with eating the hay in their mouths or staring at something only an animal would understand.

That is until a woman walked in, dressed in a black farm dress carrying a small box. As the horses saw her enter they started to get very anxious and tried to back out of the stables but it was in vain, they were trapped there. The woman approached one horse and pulled out a jar from the box. She proceeded to pour the liquid over the horses head and forced it to smell even more until its head drooped and it body slumped against the stall. 

Taking out a knife she then cut out the eyes and placed them in a small container. With the horses hardly fighting back she quickly did this for every horse until the screen went dark again. The next scene was the stables burning down and cries of the horses could be heard through the roar of the fire.

That wasn't all though.

Fast forwarding through the tape another recording flashed up, this time in the barn with the camera positioned right where the TVs lay in disrepair. Except there weren't any of the TVs in this scene, just many animals inside of small cages, stacked on top of each other. They gnawed at the bars and let out horrible cries for what seemed forever until the woman walked into frame again. She proceeded to pour the liquid on the animals, dousing the top ones and letting the rest drip on the ones below until all the movement and crying stopped. Opening each cage she took out the animal and with small tweezers pulled the eyes out of each of them placing them carefully in the very same container she kept the horse eyes in. Still alive, these animals wriggled gently but whatever was in the jars subdued them. After she finished, the screen cut away and this time instead of cages the TVs I saw broken in a pile were all stacked on top of each other. There were nine in total, the same amount of animals she had. With a knowing hand she made small openings in these TVS and proceeded to put the still alive, but blind animals in each Television box.

As the sedative wore off the animals started to desperately scratch, bite, and force their way out of the TVs while letting out desperate cries of pain. This was on vain however. The woman left the scene and came back with a chair and proceeded to watch the animals attempt to escape with their lives. 

The video cut out there, and I'm not sure what to do with this footage and evidence. The farm was abandoned and I couldn't make out a face in the videos so it seems like a complete dead end. I don't know what to do, I'm turning the evidence into the police but I'm scared they might not get caught.

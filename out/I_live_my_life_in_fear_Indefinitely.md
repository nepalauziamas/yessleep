I was enjoying my night as normal. I had just finished my calculus homework and laid in my bed to read. About 10 minutes of silence goes by and I subconsciously notice this quite rustling sound coming from the far side of my room. I think to myself that it’s probably the fan blowing some papers around, so I continue reading. 

As the minutes tick by the sound is still continuing. Me being lazy decides to turn my phone flash light on to investigate without having to get up. I notice nothing, everything looks normal but every 5 or so seconds I hear the little rustle that interrupts the silence. I sit on my bed coming up with improbable theories, “What if there’s a mouse in my trash can.” The things that go through my brain are ridiculous. 

While I’m thinking of what creature could be making this noise, I am petrified. If it were any sensible creature, it probably could have sensed my fear. I sat on my bed staring at the far corner of my room with a flashlight for about 5 minutes before I made my move. 

I cautiously made my way to the trash can and saw nothing. For context my room is upstairs and has one solid wall where my bed is and 3 other walls which cave in at an angle. I am looking at my trash in the corner and my head nearly touches the angled ceiling. As I am inspecting my innocent trash I hear the unidentified noise again, this time right above me. 

I quickly moved to the middle of the room to get away from whatever was making the noise. I decided that this was no laughing matter and turned on the lights so that I could really see. I slowly made my way to investigate the angled board that covered the corner ceiling. 

There was a small crack and inside was the most mortifying thing I have ever seen. Some kind of insect had escaped from hell and was coming after me. It was FUCKING HUGE. I have no idea what kind of bug it was but it was massive and terrifying. I quickly got my phone to video it so that I could prove it’s existence. It was trying to break free of its imprisonment of my walls and haunt me. I swear to you it looked into my eyes and took my soul. I was panicking. 

After getting a video of it, I decided to prepare for the inevitable invasion of my home. I got a shoe from my closet and went back to keep an eye on it, I did not want it to get loose in my room. I tried to record the terrorist from a better angle but it was in vein, it was just an awkward angle for my phone. As my flash was surly blinding the bitch, it fucking turned to the side and I witnessed the shear size of it. I was in shock, whatever insect this was, it was unbelievably huge. I am just mortified as it retreats into the crevices. 

I tried flicking the board to make him come back because I did not want the insect to make my walls his home. This insect was playing mind games with me and he was winning. I was scared and didnt know what to do. I mean honestly, this thing was the scariest shit I have ever experienced. I put tape over the crack hoping that it wouldn’t escape while I was asleep. 

I needed the world to know how I die so here I am typing this. It’s been about 30 minutes and I can hear the devil spawn scratching at the tape trying to escape. I have no solutions, I am truly terrified.

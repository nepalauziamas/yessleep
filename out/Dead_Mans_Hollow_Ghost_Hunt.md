Recently I went on a ghost hunt for an episode of my paranormal podcast Brave the Basement. October is approaching, and for Halloween we love to feature a ghost hunt for our audience.

I found a haunted cemetery in a small town in Indiana. It's called Dead Man's Hollow. The reason it was named Dead Man's Hollow is because in 1848 a man was leading a team of horses. The horses got spooked, and when they took off running there was an accident. The wagon the horses were pulling fell on the driver and killed him.

Other than the obvious scary name, locals have reported hearing strange things, seeing orbs, and other paranormal entities. As an amerature ghost hunter, and paranormal podcast host, we had to check it out!

It was raining when my co-host and I departed. I put in the location of the cemetery into Google maps, and we headed out. Since we were excited about our upcoming adventure, we were talking about past ghost hunts. As we were driving and talking, my phone started speaking. It kept going on about how the phone was lost. It freaked us out as I have never heard my phone do that before. We knew right then and there that this night was going to be scary!

When we arrived, we seen a little path leading into the cemetery. There was a little hill on the path. As we walked up the little hill we seen the cemetery. At first it looked very small, but as we got inside we noticed there was actually two sections. Standing in the entry there are stones on the right side. In the center was just an open grassy area. On the left was another set if stones. The place was actually well kept. I believe it is due to the power line that runs right down the middle of the place. 

We walked around a while looking at the stones and just recording content for the show. It was still raining, and you could see lightning at times. 

Suddenly my co-host said he seen something. I instantly started recording audio so he can describe what it is that he seen. He described seeing a ball of light about four feet in the air. I came to the conclusion that he either seen an orb, or even something scarier... Ball Lightning.

As we tried to investigate the orb, we both started to get this strange feeling. We both described it as a calm and peaceful feeling on the right side of the cemetery, and a "something isn't right" feeling on the left side. Since we were there on a hunt, AND recording content for Brave the Basement, we went to the left side. As we went to that side we both noticed at the same time the feeling had changed. The left was now peaceful and the right just felt wrong. As soon as we reached the grass area heading towards the right side we got a new feeling. We felt surrounded. Like someone or something was watching us. The feeling was overwhelming, and very heavy. 

We knew at this point we had to take a break. We walked back to our car to regroup our thoughts. After taking five, we decided to go back in one more time. 

As we walked up the little hill my foot caught on something and made a noise. My co-host freaked out at the sound! I calmed him down by explaining it was just my foot lol. Luckily I got that exchange recorded! (I'm never letting him live this down either)

When we made it back inside the whole place just felt calm. The bad feelings were gone. We knew then and there that the hunt was over. 

All in all it was a good hunt. My co-host seen 3 or 4 orbs. We didn't catch anything on camera unfortunately. The biggest take away was how we both had the strange feelings at the same time. That is something that I couldn't shake as we were driving home. 

I was excited about the episode and quickly went to work on putting all the audio together for the show. It really helped that it was raining because you can hear the rain hitting my umbrella and the thunder in the background. It really captured the feeling of being there.

I dont claim to have psychic abilities. I do however get feelings when I'm in haunted places. It's not like I can say "this place is haunted by the ghost of so and so, and they would like to say...) it's more of  "this just isnt right" kind of feeling. I've ghost hunted countless times, and have seen ghosts with my own eyes appear in front of me. BUT I HAVE NEVER felt this feeling weigh so heavily on me. This is one hunt I will never forget!

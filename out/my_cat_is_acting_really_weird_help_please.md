(sorry in advance English is not my first language ;)) 

Fellow cat owners I really need your help. For the last two days my cat "Kitty" has been acting really effing weird. My family and I we've had her for like five years and she's very dear to us. 

For context: We usually don't let her go outside unguided cause she has had a habit of running away, chasing after other cats and hissing at them, crossing the big street next to our house and getting herself in danger of being hit by a car etcetera etcetera. She's actually never been outside on her own. And she's never spent the night outside all by herself. 

So last Sunday we were sitting in our garden drinking coffee with grandma and our cat was just being a cat... sitting in the grass, running around, eating weird bugs... Then when we finished our coffee and wanted to go back inside our cat was gone. We tried calling her, went looking for her. After an hour we gave up as she was nowhere to be found.

Then two days ago she was suddenly back. Kitty was just sitting in our garden, watching us through the kitchen window. As you can imagine we were all just soooo very happy she was back. Especially my little brother who she has always had a strange connection with (she also sleeps in his bed and follows him around the house). Luckily she wasn't hurt. Wasn't scared. Not even a little bit.

But now - ever since she returned - she's just been acting really weird. When we call her name she doesn't listen. And she's not touched her food in two days. Since she came back she doesn't even eat her favorite little snack pockets. And she looks really skinny. In fact her skin kind of looks to big for her if that makes sense? Maybe she caught a stomach bug? Do cats also get those? She's also been very quiet. No meow, no purring. In fact she's not been making any sounds at all. Maybe she's got a cold or she's just hoarse? 

And now she's been acting even weirder. Last night when it was dark and I wanted to go to bed I saw her standing in the hallway. She was not on her fours but standing upright on her hind legs. I called her name and at first she didn't react. Then she tilted her little head and looked me in the eyes. I just stood there. Watching her watching me. And I could have sworn her eyes were looking kind of red and glowy? Then she made a sound. It didn't sound catlike. It almost sounded like a human shreik?!? And then when I blinked for just a second she went back to normal?!?

I'm really worried. Is my cat sick? Should I take her to the vet? I'd rather not as she's usually scared of strangers. Please help me. Has your cat ever behaved like this? Is there any home remedies? Maybe someone can recommend some essential oils or natural remedies?

Thanks in advance,

Miri

I don't have much time for introductions (not that there was much to introduce, anyway). Since this is still ongoing, I hope to get your advice fast. I know it may sound silly, but I fear what might occur soon.

I should start from the beginning.

On every weekend of every summer, me, my parents and my sister stay at the beach almost the entire day. Due to tradition, we have always stuck to one particular destination. 

However, things didn't go too well this time. Recently, some unsupervised, poorly-managed construction site fell apart. While there were no casualties, it scattered a lot of waste, building material and even glass shards all over the surrounding area. As a result, it was determined unsafe and shut down for an undetermined amount of time. This happened right in the middle of the summer, so our parents had to scramble to find some new place.

Before you ask, they haven't told us how they found out about this place yet. After what's been happening, I really want to know, too.

Hours ago, we arrived at the beach. Giving a passing glance, nothing appeared odd. The tide was nice, not being violent, but also not boring. On the surface, the sand looked crisp and clean. Everything was just so relaxing.

Before we began doing any though, we got to work setting up two tents. Well, me and my parents did, anyway. Meanwhile, my sister was on the lookout. We've never had any bad encounters, but mom has always said it's better to be safe than sorry.

"Hey, dad?"

"What is it, Jenny?" 

"Are you sure we didn't come earlier than usual? I can't see anyone anywhere," Jenny replied. "Shouldn't there be at least someone else, too?"

Confused by her words, I looked up from what I was doing. Looking around, I saw she was right. There were no people to be found — not even a lifeguard. While attempting to spot someone, I looked out into the horizon and noticed another abnormality. There appeared to be more terrain, maybe one mile away from shore.

"I think there's something out there in the sea," I added. Reaching into my backpack, I fetched binoculars out and threw them at Jenny, who was able to catch them. "See for yourself." I pointed to the ocean ahead.

Putting them on, she stared out into the vast body of water. "Yeah, I can see it. It looks like an island. Though, I think there's something else there," she explained, leaning forward.

"An island? That doesn't sound right," mom said. "There are no known islands around this land." Her degrees in geography, earned in quite an intensive course, lent credibility to her statement. She was most proficient in the area, after all.

"I swear, it's really there."

Finishing up the tents, mom asked Jenny for the binoculars. She obediently complied, handing them over and gesturing towards the unexplored island. Moments passed, before mom looked back at her and the rest of us, shocked.

"There really is something out there. There… are even boats sailed around it." She stared at the ground, pondering. "Maybe I mixed up areas, or forgot about something? I could've sworn I was right, though." She looked back at it. "Wonder what the place's like." Turning around, she smirked at dad. "Don't you think it might be nice?"

He nodded. "Sounds good, wanna go check it out? We can ride our dinghy there," he suggested. "The tide's calm, and doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon. We could sail there, have a short tour and leave. Perhaps we could even get someone there to show us around." 

Mom's eyes traveled to me and my sister, her face uncertain. "I'm not sure. Do you think they'll be fine?"

"You'll take care of your sister, won't you Marcus?" he addressed me.

I nodded confidently. Being the older brother, I was often tasked with looking after her. Over the years, I had gotten better at it, and she had obviously become more independent. Honestly, I think our parents just don't feel they can trust her yet, despite her probably being capable of watching herself. But not to worry them, I went along with it. 

"Promise you'll behave," he told Jenny. 

She rolled her eyes. "I will. I'm 13. You don't have to treat me like a child, you know?"

"Sure," he replied. "Then it's settled. We'll be back in an hour or two, probably less." With that, he retired back to the car to get the boat.

Me and mom talked for a while, whilst Jenny explored around the beach. Eventually, dad came back, carrying the dinghy. The two of us helped him bring it to shore. Jenny remained around the tent, so dad told what to relay to her. Following five minutes of frankly repetitious, and perhaps overbearing rules, I simply nodded.

"Both you, stay safe," mom said, kissing me on the cheek. "We'll be back soon."

I observed them boating towards the island for a few minutes. However, a sudden yell made me turn around. It came from the tent.

Racing over, I saw Jenny holding her right-hand thumb. A small stream of blood was coming from a cut, staining the sand below her. I took a deep breath. Maybe I wasn't as good at looking after as I thought. 

I came to her side. "Geez, what did you do?" I asked, fetching a medkit from one of the tents. She cringed slightly, as I grabbed her injured finger in order to apply a band aid. 

"It was an accident," she argued, pointing at a familiar box lying on the sand. "I just tried to open that, when it cut me. Why does dad even store things inside it?"

The box was mostly composed of plastic, but there was a thin layer of metal along where it and its lid connected. It was half open. I could see a bit of red staining the metal, too. Dad stored our two shovels there. This was due to an accident five years ago, where Jenny disrupted other people's relaxation by digging near them. She got us expelled that day, when another kid fell into one of her holes. He still hadn't let that go.

"Why do you need a shovel?" I asked.

"I think I found something interesting in the sand," she replied. "Just let me use the shovel, and I'll show you."

Although I was confused, I figured it wouldn't do any harm. Carefully removing the lid from the container, I passed her her precious seven year old shovel. Smiling, she told me to follow her.

We walked around twenty feet away from the tents, before she stopped. She gestured for me to look down. Doing so, I noticed something emerging from a small dune. Smirking, she dug it out in one swoop.

"Did you really need a shovel for that?" I asked, sighing.

"What's the problem? You gave me the shovel, it's not my fault you didn't question me further. I did find something, didn't I?"

I contemplated snatching the damn thing off her hands before she went crazy it, but decided to let it slide. At least there wasn't anyone here for her to piss off. Instead, I just grabbed whatever she'd dug out. 

Surprisingly, it wasn't just some thrown out junk, but rather a journal. Its cover was tattered, yet I could still make out the words :School project — traveling.

This made me raise an eyebrow. Why would someone throw it away?

Noticing my expression, Jenny took a look herself. "Whoever it belonged to must've failed that project," she giggled. "Maybe I can steal Ana's next graded presentation and bury it the day before. That would teach her not to be such a bitch."

"All she did was tell on you. Rightfully so, since you were trying to sneak into her brother's room. You knew he didn't like you crushing on him, yet you still did it. And you did it while his parents were still unsure of how they felt about me dating Grace," I retorted. "If anyone is a female dog, it's the one who nearly ruined her brother's relationship trying to harass his girlfriend's younger brother."

"That was years ago."

"Only two years ago," I corrected. "If you're using age as an argument, then why are you still raging at her over it?" Flipping the journal open, I checked the first page to ascertain its readability. 

"All you can think of is Grace," she flipped the subject. "It's always Grace this, Grace that. You don't even take my feelings into account," she said, punctuating that last sentence with a shove. 

That last insult did it. Next thing I knew, I had snatched the shovel from her hands and pushed her away. And I hurled it randomly. It tumbled down the dunes, towards the shore. Jenny barely had time to process it, before she raced after it, likely fearing the sea would pull it in.

Without a word, I headed back to my tent. She could handle it herself, for all I cared. I checked my phone. Twenty minutes since they had left.

'This is going to be a disaster,' I thought. Why hadn't I convinced them to bring us along? It wouldn't take more than one or two extra trips. However, I didn't attempt to call them. It was too late now, and they deserved to have their pleasant time together without interruptions. Sighing, I figured I would just make Jenny stay in the other tent once she came back.

In the meantime, I focused on the journal once again. Despite having my cell phone, I was too frustrated to search for something I liked online. I skimmed through the first two pages, which basically amounted to the owner presenting themselves and what they would be discussing.

The owner's name was apparently Ian. He was 16, and he was presenting an essay about a strange beach his parents had come across. According to him, his parents were originally hesitant about bringing him and his sister along, as they'd been told the place was barren, and feared they wouldn't be able to call for help if they needed to.

At that point, I searched for a date of writing, which I found in the top of the first page. 

8/17/1992

Exactly 30 years ago. That sparked my interest even further, and I was eager to read on.

The rest of this post will mostly consist of the following pages, transcribed to the best of my abilities. I was forced to interpret some parts, while others were just too deteriorated to decipher at all, so keep that in mind. I'm very unnerved.

8/17/1992

A pleasant breeze gently swayed the small flora, as we traversed the path leading to the remote beach. 

It had taken me quite a while to convince my parents to take me here. Sadly, we had to bring my younger brother along as no one was available to look after him. Immediately after arriving, I pulled my binoculars out and began observing the horizon.

If you're unaware, the reason this area interests me so much is due to a certain rumor that's been circulating around. According to it, an island supposedly appears around a mile away from here on certain, special days. No one knows why, how or aven exactly when it appears. What is known is that entering the area is severely discouraged, as no one has ever left it.

Silly story, right? I think so too, but the majority appears to disagree. It is honestly incredible how such a fabricated tale could deter so many from coming. There isn't anyone in sight.

How could anyone believe this? I mean, if that many people were truly disappearing, wouldn't the police eventually start suspecting something was amiss. After all, there would definitely be multiple people who saw the supposed island without entering it. People should really start scrutinizing what they hear more thoroughly. 

I had a small nap at the tent. We are staying sunset, so there is plenty of time. 

My brother informed me our parents had gone fishing, as I expected they would. They allegedly left me with the responsibility of looking after him, seemingly forgetting this assignment. 

Despite my current frustration, I feel I'm not losing much. That island clearly doesn't exist. According to my research, this date of the year has more incidents than any other by a long shot. I think it's safe to say there's nothing out there.

My brother's shouting for me to come out and see something. I will be back later.

Okay, stuff is getting somewhat weird now. There is a weird structure out in the ocean. I'm fairly certain it was not there before. It's probably just a ship or cruise — it's too far away to tell. Maybe I can use the binoculars we have lying around to get a better view; I will decide later.

In the meantime, I guess it's a good time to elaborate on the legend itself. Obviously, it would be impossible to list everything in a reasonable time frame; and so, I will boil it down to what I feel is most noteworthy.

The island is said to have existed for thousands of years now. While there's no general consensus to its origins, two theories seem to be more prominent. 

The first one states that the area was the home of a powerful tribe, known for their strength. They were at war with another tribe that inhabited the area that would later become the infamous beach. One night, a young member of the island tribe managed to ambush and murder the leader of the coast. Due to their beliefs, the island tribe thought they now possessed control over their enemy. To celebrate, the adults sailed to the coast, intent on flaunting their victory. However, once they arrived, they were dragged through the sand and tied up by the enraged people of the coast. The dead leader's son stood before them and ordered their death.

It's said the execution was so horrible, written records of it were forbidden, leaving them lost in history. No matter the answer, the onslaught wasn't finished yet. The broken heart of the fatherless son was filled with rage. He would not allow the existence of the wretched island tribe. They sailed to the mass of land, wearing the skin of the adults — the skin of the parents of those that remained on that island. Fooled by their disguise, the children let them in, only to realize their mistake; but it was already too late. 

That's the rather abrupt ending of the first theory. Very weird. It doesn't really explain the location's disappearance that well. I mean, if it was really haunted, wouldn't the furious spirits want to get as many victims as possible? Why purposefully limit their opportunities by only appearing sometimes?

The second one is not much better, though. It does maintain the existence of a tribe on the island thousands of years ago, but mentions nothing of a coastal tribe. In this version, the inhabitants were very weak and cowardly — their survival hinging entirely on their isolation. 

One day, a young member had an idea. Perhaps, if they implored, the gods of the island would grace them with strength and courage. After much convincing, the leader approved. For the ritual, they waited until it was foggy, then sailed to the coast. They collected its sand, and returned. Back in their tribe, they reunited all the sand they'd brought and set it ablaze. They claimed for the gods of the island to seize control of the coast, for it was their godly right, and then begged for strength and courage more fierce than that of lions.

Unfortunately, it's said one of them botched some part of the ritual. Everything appeared wonderful at first. The men, women and children felt their fears dissipate and their bodies blossom to perfection. However, over time, they began growing paranoid. Without fear, however, their paranoia manifested into delirious episodes of rage. It's unknown how long this lasted. However, it all ended one day, when the island disappeared, along with everyone on it.

I guess this one at least gives some context to alleged island's abnormal properties. However, this one makes the lack of reports even more confusing. Again, what happens to those that see the island but choose not to go?

When you move away from origins, things generally get less detailed, ironically enough. From what I have read, the stories are very similar in nature. I will tell you one of them, just so you get an idea.

In the 50s, a young couple was taking a shortcut to a party, when they allegedly came across this very beach. They stopped there, as the man had to release his excremental liquid, leaving the woman staring out into the ocean. Desiring to remain unseen, the man headed into the forested area nearby. Once he was finished, he emerged from the trees, only to find the entire beach and ocean shrouded by fog. Confused, he began making his way back to the car. However, as he did, he was hit by an intense wave of nausea, combined with an ever-growing dizziness. Persistently, he managed to get to the door of his vehicle, but fainted before he could enter. The last thing he saw before his consciousness fully faded was the unconscious body of his girlfriend.

Thankfully, both were unharmed, being found shortly afterwards and brought to this hospital. The man awoke the next day. As for the woman, it took a while longer — a week, to be exact. 

The man ended up relaying most of the information. However, the woman had an intriguing piece of information to add herself.

A few minutes after her partner had left, she swore she saw something begin to emerge in the ocean, around a mile ahead. She claimed that was the last thing she remembered before waking up in the white bed, with a nurse standing over her.

The story ends with an alleged statement from the guy who found them. 

He claimed not to have seen anything amiss, aside from the two unconscious individuals. When inquired about why he was there, he claimed he had come to check on some of his extended family, as they were supposed to visit him after spending some time on the beach. His family was never found.

Yeah, I know. Pretty usual, urban legend fare. Personally, I wouldn't mind too much, were it not making people needlessly avoid a perfectly fine beach. Makes you wonder how bored one has to be to think creating such tales is a good use of time. 

I don't think there is much else to explore, really. This is probably enough, too. I will use those binoculars, figure out what kind of ship that figure is, and that will be all. I'm hoping to edit this entire text into something more concise, accurate and better flowing. The professor is putting a ton of value into this project. If I fail it, I doubt my other grades will be worth anything.

(Following this entry, clarity began declining rapidly. Due to that, I had to interpret some things myself, while other stuff was just too incomprehensible)

I'm pretty sure this is just a dream. Probably taking another nap or something. Then again, most lucid dreams allow you to do anything, but everything seems normal; well, besides the mass of land that just appeared in the middle of the ocean. But there's no way it can be real, right? I guess this dream will be an interesting addition, I hope.

Anyway, I pried the binoculars off my brother's hands, and observed the figure. Turns out, in this dream, it wasn't a ship at all. It was an island. An entire island, with small boats anchored beside it. An island that appeared from nowhere, just like the legends.

I'm currently waiting inside the tent, having made my brother stay on the other one. Our parents aren't back yet. I'm pretty sure I will wake up with them standing over me. I have heard sleeping in a dream is a good way to wake up, so I will try that.

(Things deteriorated further in the next entry)

Oh god, no. This can't be real, it can't fucking be. 

The first thing I did when I awoke was check this journal out. Once I found the last entry still present, I freaked out. I even got a cut on my hand, while scrambling to exit the tent. That pain was real, completely fucking real.

Looking around, I noticed there was fog everywhere. I couldn't see anything beyond the distance between myself and the shore. Except for a large shape far ahead — that mass of land, mocking me for doubting its existence.

I shouted for mum and dad, but there was no response. Minutes passed, until my brother finally made me stop, asking what was going on. I tried explaining it to him; however, it was obvious his less developed brain couldn't process how dire our situation was. Trying to think logically in this purely irrational situation, I grabbed him by the arm and tried making my way out of the beach. We walked for five minutes, making sure to remain on a straight line, yet we came upon the same fucking place again. We tried again and again, until we gave up and moved back to our tents.

We're currently huddled together in the same tent. I don't fucking know what to do. 

Wait, I think I see something sailing over.

(The following is the last entry. Keep in mind, this had the most holes in the writing.)

Why would they do this? No, it can't be them, right?! Who the hell would do something like this?!

(-) came back. My brother was relieved, but I knew something was amiss. (-) was tight on them, and their bodies were too big. Despite my warnings, my brother ran over to them.

They, they (this excerpt was splashed with something, presumably tears) him slowly. He screamed so hard, as crimson stained his clothes and the sand beneath him. Those bastards laughed, they enjoyed it. They (-) and held it for me to see. 

I sprinted back inside the tent. I can hear them (-) and tearing it. They're ripping off his (-).

I know I can't run or fight them. I fucking can't. I'm sorry Tim, I'm such a coward. All I wanted was to pass a project, why did this happen?! Why did he have to die? Why did he get his future mercilessly torn away? Why will my future be mercilessly torn away too?

(This was followed by a bunch of scribbles, which I can only assume formed either an angry, or fearful rant. Then came the last two paragraphs.)

I've torn a hole through the fabric of the tent leading into the sand. I'm going to bury this journal, in case anyone else stumbles across this.

If you're reading this, get out now! Please, do it before it comes. Once the fog comes, it's too late. They are near you.
 
(And that's how it ended.)

I tried telling myself this was just a joke, but I'm not so sure anymore. Our parents are still on that island, doing god knows what. My phone has been having signal interruptions, and my mobile data barely functions now. I have typed this down several times already. It fails constantly.

And when I exited the tent, I saw the weather had suddenly grown foggy. 

It's covering everything beyond the distance between me and the shore. All, except for a huge shape farther away in the ocean.

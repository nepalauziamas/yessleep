This experience happened when I was 17. 

I received a phone call off a friend who invited me to a house party on the other side of town. Since it was a Friday and I had nothing else going on that night, I decided to go and check it out, so I met up with 2 of my other friends and we all headed to the party. 

When we arrived, there was a ton of people at the party and we barely knew anybody, but alcohol was flowing freely and the music was good so we all opened a beer and started talking with random people.  

After a couple of hours I realise I'm really wasted, but this time it felt different. I had been drunk many times before, even to the point of becoming extremely sick, but it never once felt like this. I was confused, couldn't see or think straight and felt physically terrible, even though I hadn't drunk much more than a few beers and a shot. 

I ended up leaving the party on my own and trying to make my way back to my house on the other side of the city, which was about an hours walk away. I was walking for no longer than 10 minutes along an empty road when a guy came up behind me and started talking to me. Even in this state I could feel bad vibes from him, but I was so out of it that I couldn't see his face, it was just a blur of mess. I told him my dad lived in the next street and that I was going home but he became aggressive and threatening. 

Even at 17 I was a pretty intimidating guy, I was 6'1 and 190lbs with a fair amount of muscle so I never usually had any issues with guys being aggressive towards me, but being in such a vulnerable state, I knew I didn't have a chance of taking this guy on so I played it cool. 


He kept telling me to follow him and before I knew it I realised we had been walking for hours, in the opposite direction to my house. This guy continued talking and I began to realise he was trying to take me back to his house so as soon as a moment presented itself, I turned and ran in the opposite direction, with every ounce of energy I could muster. The thing that always scares me is I vividly remember looking back and seeing him chasing me down, like an animal chasing its prey, while screaming for me to stop. I eventually lost him and made my way home. 

I'm convinced I was spiked at that party, maybe he was there and he was the one who did it. God knows what his plans were if he had managed to get me into his apartment, maybe I wouldn't be here today.  The thing that still scares me to this day though is that he's completely faceless to me, thinking that I could have passed him in the street, possibly even had a conversion with a friendly stranger without ever realising its him, that's a terrifying thought to me.

The sound of sirens filled the air while red and blue lights flooded the nearby houses. A firefighter who just arrived to the scene is walking through the rubble as he stumbles upon a handwritten note that has had the top half of it burned away. The legible parts read: 

“I had to. 

There was a brief moment of transitory stillness, such as that of standing in the eye of a hurricane. Though, the fallaciously serene atmosphere was quickly unveiled by booming thuds, which one could have easily mistaken for thunder. 

After slamming shut the door, now prisoning her behind, the screaming began. Pleads and cries were intertwined with a barely audible, low grumbling. In all other contexts, one would have assumed the grumbling to be from a large, wounded animal who knows that soon it’s last breath will be taken. But that assumption would be far from any correct answer. The sounds are coming from what previously was my bedroom, but now could be considered a cell. 

The screams soon shifted into bellowing shrieks, which seemed to continuously ricochet off every corner of my mind. In an almost hypnotic way, I slowly slithered down the wall to the floor, where I patiently waited.

After what felt like days of being scrutinizingly sat on the other side of the door, the wails stopped. 
I finally broke and almost let her out. 
I anxiously hobbled to my feet in an attempt to peer through the hole of the lock, hoping to see her still alive. Instead I could see nothing but an overwhelming blackness pouring from every corner of the room, flooding it with darkness.

The tranquil stillness was now back, and I was half expecting another loud bang to jolt the door, but nothing.
Slowly, I pulled at the handle on the door. 
It was now cracked open about half an inch and an extremely deep, almost heavy feeling now filled my entire stomach. 
I hesitated for a moment before tilting my head slightly as to catch a glimpse of what might be inside.
At that moment the door swung out with incredible force, being held back only by my body. 
What reached out through the opening wasn’t a hand, but a gnarled, withered mass of flesh with bony protrusions as fingers.
Now it seemed as though I was in the wall of the hurricane. The shrieks started up again full force, and this time it was as though every unintelligible incantation she vomited out was being thrown by the force of a tornado. The ground and walls were trembling with an unnatural movement. 

After a great amount of struggle I managed to slam shut the door for a second time. The only difference from the first being the rotted finger that once, and still, bears the engagement ring I got her six months ago now laying next to my foot.

We bought this home so that we could have a fresh start, our own family. Now all of that has been taken away, and taken away by myself nonetheless. I’m writing this note so that people know the story of what happened here, because by the time anyone reads this, our home will have long been a smoking pile of rubble and nearly burnt out embers.

I am sorry.”

The firefighter, in shock of what he just read, decides to return to his truck to report his findings to someone higher up. As he is walking he noticed something small glimmer from within a pile of ashes, and goes over to investigate. 
He feels a heavy feeling start to take over his stomach the longer he looks at the light reflecting off of this object. He picks up a small, golden engagement ring and studies it for a few seconds, debating whether or not he should just take it and call what happened here an accident. 
A few hours later, the firefighter is back at his own home, which he shares with his girlfriend of three years. 
During average conversation she decides to ask him about when he is planning on proposing to her.
He, thinking back to the small, gold ring he snuck into his pocket earlier that day, replied with an almost menacing smile and only said the word “soon”.

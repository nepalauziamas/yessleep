If you're reading this, I'm probably either dead or fearing for my life.I feel *it* roaming around my head and it's most likely gonna end me soon.

All of this happen 2 weeks ago at my scool.Me and a few of my classmates were playing volleyball outside.There were about 10 of us and we had this rule:If you failed to pass the ball to the other person and it flew over you,then you'll be the one to go and get it.Basically,miss the ball and you're gonna run after it.

We were playing next to our school's basement.It's a small opening with wood on top of it to prevent it from flooding.It has an old rusty railing on the left side and on the right side,it's connected to our school's building.

I was the unfortunate one to not catch the ball in time,and so it flew right down the stairs.As I made my way there,I felt uneasy,but I brushed it off.

I reached the stairs and I could see all types of trash there,from packs of chips to bottles of beer.And the smell.Oh god,the smell.It was horrible.It's still imprinted in my brain.

I started making my way down the stairs.It was getting colder.It felt as if I was walking directly into a freezer,but I thought it was because it's underground level,so of course it's gonna be cold.

As I reached the bottom,everything was getting darker and darker.I could barely see ahead of me.I had to hold my breath the whole time,since the smell was getting worse.

I reached the bottom and I was frozen in my place for some reason.I couldn't move.I felt paranoid.It felt as if someone,or *something* , was watching me from every corner.I heard whispers,but I couldn't understand what they were saying.It felt like a nightmare.

The voices of my classmates snapped me out of my trance.I quickly grabbed the ball and as I made my way up the stairs,I made the mistake of looking back.The door.The door was slightly opened.But how?It's always closed.

The worst part wasn't the door tho,it was what was behind it.I saw something.An eye.It was white.Pure white,with a small dot as it's pupil.It smiled at me.It had shiny pointy teeth and it was smiling at me.

I whipped my head back and quickly ran up the stairs.We resumed our game,but I couldn't help but still feel paranoid.I felt like something was right behind.I was zoning out way too much to the point I got hit in the face with the ball a few times.

The bell finally rang.We went back to class and everyone was talking,only I was quiet.I couldn't speak.What I saw back there was on my mind.I had so many questions,but they didn't matter now.

The teacher finally started explaining what we had to do for our class,and then she looked at me.She stopped talking and asked me if I'm okay.I was confused.Why was she asking me this?She told me that I'm very pale,so she called me over so she could check my temperature.

The moment I got up,everything went black and I hit the floor.

I woke up.I was laying down on a bed.It was dark.Pitch black.I couldn't move.It felt as if I couldn't breathe and my voice wouldn't come out.As my eyes scanned the place I saw something.The thing from the basement.It was here.

It was tall and slim,with long skinny fingers.It was all black,like a caricature you draw on a piece of paper out of boredom.It was staring at me with the same smile.I wanted to scream.I wanted to scream so badly but I couldn't.

It started approaching me.It reached out with it's hand and placed it on my face.It started squeezing me,as if trying to crush my head.

I was suddenly awakened by the nurse shaking me.I was sweating bricks while shaking.The nurse,a sweet old lady,looked at me with worry and asked me if I'm feeling well.She took my temperature and after a while, she told me that it's too high for me to stay in school,so she called my mom.

Ever since then,I see it in my dreams.I feel it's presence around me.It feels like it's sucking the life out of me.I hate it.I haven't slept well because I catch glimpses of it walking around my room or waving to me from my window.

It won't leave me alone.It's presence give me intrusive thoughts,and the only thing I keep thinking about is killing myself so I could escape from it.

It won't leave me alone no matter what I do.

I have finally taken my decision tho.I'm gonna take my life tonight.At this point,escaping from it is my only goal and I don't care about the consequences.

I hope it will finally leave me alone.

For those who don't know if you put that number in your wrist and you go to sleep you may be trapped in your dream forever. It's a Tuesday night and I see a TikTok of someone doing it but it doesn't work so I get curious and I do it cause why not. It's 10:50 PM and I put the number on my wrist. I go to sleep but before I go to sleep I write a note saying that if I don't wake up I'm sorry to my parents and siblings.

I wake up and think that nothing ended up happening so I start laughing but then I realize that I'm not in bed. It was like a illusion so everything started to fade and all of a sudden I was in a forest with some bunker around. I start walking around, I could nearly see anything since its like pitch black. There was swings around the place alot of trees. The things that scared me the most is since my eyesight is pitch black right now, I see like random things like in the corner of my eye and usually it's white.

I wouldn't be able to see but since it's white it shows alot. I also heard alot of random noises like branches breaking from the floor like if you step on one of them. Sometimes the swings were swinging like alot. It scared me alot but I kept on walking I found a door it was white but very far distance from where I saw it. So I started walking closer and all of a sudden a loud noise like a screeching but bass boosted sound I was nearly able to walk. With the bass boost I started seeing things like creatures it looked like they wanted to tell me something but I was keeping my ears shut.

Alot of the creatures were pointing at something behind me I was to scared to look back. When I was getting closer to the door the sound was getting so loud that I could feel the bass in my bones. I decided to look back. That was the worst decision I've ever done in my whole life. It was some type of monster his face looked like me but incomplete, one of his eye was just slowly falling off and once it saw me looking into him it rushed towards me I knew everything would hurt in my body if I ran but I had no choice. So I ran as a fast as I could into the door once I made it in everything became quiet and it felt like I could hear my own thoughts. Then the floor turned into sand which made me fall into it and it was like 1 layer of sand cause after I fell into it, it was just a black hole from there on. 

There was alot of things I could hold on to when I fell I grabbed on one of the sticks which held me for a good while. I started climbing back up with the sticks near it. Once I got back up I saw another person fall down and once he hit the bottom of the black hole his body dissolved into sand. That scared me to death I thought if I didn't get into one of the sticks I would've died. I kept on going it was nearly pitch black but for some reason it felt visible to me so I kept on walking. I slowly started realizing that everything here is just a dream and I can't die. That realization helped me alot cause most of the stuff I saw while walking didn't scare me. Once I saw another door saying exit in the top I walked toward it I knew this was gonna be some type of trap so I did the stupidest thing which I thought was the stupidest. I jumped up and down as hard as I can and then I fell right threw the floor into a bright light and woke up. One thing tho I didn't wake up in my bed.

I woke up at the hospital and supposedly I haven't woke up in a day my dad was so happy that he saw me awake same with my mom and brothers they though I was dead cause I didn't wake up even tho they nearly tried everything. My mom got mad at me cause she thought I was doing some type of drugs or trying to posses myself. So we went to a pastor and they said nothing was wrong with me just to be careful what I right on myself. It has been exactly 3 days since this all happened and I won't ever do something like this again. Like I always say.

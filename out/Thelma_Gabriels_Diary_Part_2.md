Hello. Those of you who read the last post already know me. For those unfamiliar, I'm Officer Crystal Locks, new to the police force in the town of Blackthorne, Ohio and I recently discovered the diary of a creepy little girl named Thelma Gabriel from the 60s in my backyard. A girl with strange powers who appeared to want to imitate little Anthony Fremont himself, for all you Twilight Zone fans out there.

I can't shake the nagging feeling that somebody wanted me to find the stupid thing. Like I said in my previous post, this little girl clearly never lived in my three-room no-stairs fixer-upper of a house. I feel like someone planted it in my backyard. I'm a police officer, for pity's sake; I'm supposed to be good at figuring out this kind of stuff, solving crimes and all that. But still, I'm even second-guessing my own decision to join the force in this town. I mean, I'd never fully resign; nothing creepy's happened to it, it's a perfectly normal town, and above all I'd be infinitely screwed if I resigned. So I just read the diary every night and pray things stay normal, even though I'm an atheist. That's how paranoid I am.

There are only seven entries in the diary, and entries 1 and 2 are in my previous post. Let's get down to entries 3 and 4:

*November 5, 1961*

*Church was boring today. I really don't see why we have to go to church every Sunday to worship some boring old man I've never met. But I don't dare say that to Momma and Daddy 'cause they say that stuff like that is blasphemy. I think 'blasphemy' is a funny word, but one time I giggled when Daddy was lecturing me and I got a spanking. A bad one.*

*Anyway, I kept imagining the stupid priest as a giant ladybug, and it made me laugh, but I used my powers to make Daddy forget, so I didn't get a spanking when we got home.*

*I decided to make the stupid priest a real ladybug, too. I think he'd be better like that. And no one would ever have to listen to one of his stupid droning sermons again! So after church, I invited Violet to sneak around with me into where the priest was, and during confessional time I turned him into a ladybug. Not a giant one, though. Just a regular one. And then I crushed him between my fingers!*

*Violet didn't see that last part though. Everyone's still freaking out over my teacher disappearing, but I still say he makes a better jack-in-the-box than he does a teacher.*

*I made it snow today too. Me and Violet threw snowballs at Polly when she was kissing her new boyfriend. She called us brats and ran away to kiss somewhere else.*

*So overall, today was fun, but church was boring. But at least the priest's gone now!*

.......

*November 6, 1961*

*Today we were back at school. Mr Hinnaw's gone of course, and he's been replaced by Mrs Millie. I like Mrs Millie. She's pretty.*

*Today at school, we were asked about what we want to be when we grow up. I don't want to be anything because I don't wanna grow up. Grownups are boring and wrinkly and they don't think anything is fun. I'll never end up like that, especially not with my powers! With these powers, I can make myself never age anyway. I can even be just like the old man in the sky that I gotta pray to every night! And then everyone will have to pray to ME!*

*And speaking of my powers, I didn't transform anyone today, but I did set Polly's dress on fire! It's see-through and naughty and she was gonna go out with her boyfriend wearing it. After I burned it, she couldn't find it, and boy was she mad! But she couldn't complain to Momma and Daddy, or else they'd know about her boyfriend. Ha! And she's always saying I'm HER stupid sister! She doesn't even know about my powers! She doesn't even know her equally stupid friend Linda calls her a 'horr'. I don't know what that means, but it doesn't sound like a nice name. I heard Linda calling her it when she was on the phone at our house and Polly was out of the room.*

*Also today, me and Violet took a break from everyone and everything and just played in the school gardens. I shrunk us down so we were the size of the flowers, and we had some real fun playing in them!*

*I brought Susan to life again today. She still says she loves me, but it sounded a little less sure than before. I hope my powers aren't wearing out. People are really freaking out over Mr Hinnaw and the priest's disappearance, so I decided to wipe everyone's memories and wipe the town of any traces of them. Now no one remembers them and no one's worried anymore.*

*What I don't understand is why anyone was worried in the first place. They were real boring and me and Violet sure didn't like them.*

*I'm considering leaving this stupid town and all its stupid grownups. And speaking of stupid grownups, I made a lady disappear today!*

*She was hitting a little boy with her purse and when she walked away from him, I wished she was gone and she was! And then I wiped the town of memories and traces of her, so now no one's worried about her. I believe the people in that episode I watched called it 'being sent to the cornfield'. I hope all the corn is frozen so she'll starve to death in there.*

*I have to go to bed now!*

Worse and worse as it goes along. I knew kids were basically psychopaths at that age, but this little Anthonia Fremont (as I've come to call her) takes it to a whole new level.

Should I turn this in to the force or not?

Well, maybe I shouldn't be asking that question yet, as you haven't seen **entries 5, 6 or 7 yet...**

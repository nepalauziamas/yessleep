There is a diner on 53rd street and it is strange.

My home has not been the same ever since my wife died in a horrific skiing accident a year ago. After I returned to work from bereavement leave, I volunteered for overtime. I took on projects I never would have before to keep my body and mind busy. I am employed as a shipping/receiving clerk. It is not glamorous, but it was all I could cling to shortly after Gwen passed away. 

I sold my car and chose to walk from my workplace to my apartment every day. It was a two mile stretch. The exercise proved to be beneficial. The movement would keep me preoccupied from the nagging loneliness and sense of loss.

I passed a 1950’s style diner at the end of a street corner with a flickering neon sign. It sat between an old foreclosed Laundromat and a tattoo parlor. The diner was open twenty four hours. It had a large sign on the front which advertised this fact with a red inked exclamation mark at the end. 

I refused to go in for months because of the way the cook stared at me whenever I passed by the window. He was a heavyset man. 

I walked in one night after a particularly long shift. The place was devoid of any other customers. My hunger gnawed at me and this place was the only available option. As soon as I entered, a horrific stench met me. I presumed it as expired food. Alternative rock music blared in the background.

The cook glared at me as he grabbed a butcher knife. He seemed to walk closer to me before the server waved him to the back and advised him how she would help me find a seat.

I looked at her name tag. It read Vanessa. She wore a red and yellow polyester uniform. Her service was professional and friendly. I knew from experience these traits were not always common on graveyard shifts. 

“Would you like something to drink?”

“A glass of water with a lemon wedge would be perfect,” I said. “Also, I know what I’d like to order. I’ll take a bacon cheddar burger regular fries and a side of ranch.”

“Coming right up,” she said as she grabbed the menu and went to the back.

I should note that, besides her gregarious demeanor, the service was terrible. She did not ask me how I wanted my burger cooked and the order took forever to end up placed before me. and she did not offer refills. 

My parents were both in the service industry. I have always worked on the principle to leave a generous tip as a result, even when the experience has been subpar. The best way to retaliate is to never go back again if one's unsatisfied. Still, I always showed respect with a five or ten bucks. The mere fact that this person is in a grueling and thankless industry merited it. 

As I received my check and prepared to place my bills in the server’s leather book organizer, my jaw dropped at what I saw. 

Vanessa had written her name and phone number on the receipt. 

I looked up and she stared at me with a flirtatious smile. This seemed to come out of nowhere. I had to remind myself of how terrible I am at reading signs after so many years of being in a dedicated marriage. 

Twelve months went by in a heartbeat, and it did not feel long enough to start dating again. I had to turn Vanessa down and tell her I was not ready as I handed her my payment. 

“I hope you come in again,” she said. “This was my first shift here. Are you a regular?”

“No,” I said as I looked back at the cook, “but I will be. The fries were incredible.” 

The man grunted at me.

I went in there again the next night. A new girl in the same style of server’s uniform seated me. Her name tag read Katherine, and she had red hair which flowed past her shoulders.     

“Is Vanessa here tonight by chance?” I asked.

“Oh, she quit. I’m her replacement.”

I wanted to inquire further but did not want to seem nosy. I scratched my chin and shrugged before I made my order. 

This time the food was even worse. The burger came out overcooked. The fries had old oil stains the layperson might mistake for seasoning. Still, I tipped well.

I also went back the following night. Some of you might be asking why I would return when each time has been so unsatisfying. I must admit I’m not much of a cook, and, like many Americans, I forsake quality for convenience. Without a car and an appetite during a certain set of hours when everything's closed, you can only be so picky.

When I walked in, the first person I saw was the cook again. He looked disappointed to see me. I was a disgruntled landlord come to collect late rent. Once again none of the booths had any other guests.

I saw the server approach me with a menu in hand. She was new, and her name tag read Jocelyn. She had blond hair, green eyes, and a nice enough smile, even though I could tell something bothered her. She was uncomfortable to be there. 

“Are you…new here?” I asked. 

“Yes,” she said. “It’s my first day on the job.”

“What happened to Katherine?” 

“She quit. May I get you something to drink?”

“The turnover here is pretty bad, huh?”

“I wouldn’t know. We have free refills on coffee if you’d like?”

I continued to go in every night. As sleazy, decrepit, and inconsistent as the place was in its quality, it became a regular part of my routine. All the while, I was meeting a new waitress every time. None of them knew the one before, but had only heard about them. The cook had badmouthed each ex-employee to the current one, a sign of a toxic work environment. 

Each night, I tried to keep a close eye on the cook and even pay attention to the way he treated the servers. It became obvious after a while that he was also the manager, or made one de facto. He often barked directions at them. His behavior disgusted me. I tipped him well in the past, and I was starting to feel guilty for having given him any kind of support. He even threatened to write one of them up for a improper appearance. He stated how every server needed to have their hair let down. I found this strange, considering most eating establishments demand the opposite. 

He must have noticed how my demeanor towards him had shifted. He came out of the back and spoke to me for the first time.

“We don’t want your business here,” he said. His voice sounded gravelly, tobacco-stained.

“What have I done wrong?”

“You’re making the girls uncomfortable.”

“Excuse me?” I asked, feeling a rage starting to simmer to the surface. “You have a new one working here each day. *You’re* the one guilty of that. Are you one of those sick freaks who kill your own employees? You have the faces of each former server hung on meat hooks in the back.”

He nodded, took in a deep breath, and then flipped my table over. 

I have not been in a fight since High School, and I was not eager to get in one now, offended as I was. I walked out as he yelled out how if he ever saw me in there again he would have me arrested. 

\*

To recap, don’t ever visit the diner on 53rd Street. The food is terrible, the service is horrible. I should have seen the red flags. The fact that I was the only customer to have ever stepped foot in there most nights should have been an indicator. 

The other night, I started Google searching the first names of all the servers. A few women with identical first names have gone missing in this area. It is weird, but a coincidence more likely than not. I hope those women found better jobs somewhere else.

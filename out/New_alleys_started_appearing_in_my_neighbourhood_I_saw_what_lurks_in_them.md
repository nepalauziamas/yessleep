Hey everyone, I didn't know where to go to post this, I saw something that simply shouldn't exist and I'm shaking at in my office as I'm writing this. I'll start from the beginning. 

My name is Trevor, I work at the local mcdonalds, pay isn't much but it pays the bills. I walk to and from the work, I have a lot of anxiety and I don't like to take public transportatiom unless I absolutely have to. I also can't afford a car yet so I just opt for walking. 

I'm very familiar with the road to and from my workplace, it's a nice neighbourhood, mostly filled by elderly people. I don't mind it, they seem much more laid back, I couldn't ask for more. 

That's why I wasn't scared to walk to and from my work, up until a few hours ago anyways. It first started 3 days ago. I was going to work as usual, I did the night shifts and I was making my way there, earphones in and it looked just like any other night. Streets were quiet, people were inside their houses, most of the residents asleep by that point probably. 

On my way there I felt a sensation of something watching me, but I couldn't find anything unusual so I just thought it was my anxiety and moved on, even though I still couldn't shake the feeling. 

The night went as usual, some rude customers but that's to be expected. Time came for me to go home so I grabbed my things and headed straight home. As I was walking, music blasting in my ear, I got the sensation again, just this time it was stronger. 

I pulled my earphones out and looked around for anything unusual. That's when I noticed, It was the same place that gave me that dreadful feeling when I was going to work. I felt chills in my body from that thought alone, I didn't feel safe there. 

I walked forward a bit, about to put my earphones back in, when something crashed in an alley next to me. As I looked over I realized something that turned my blood cold. It came from an alley that I don't remember ever being there. I was sure it was never there, I knew these roads perfectly. 

There was nothing in it, and when I say nothing, I mean it. There was no trash, no posters, no graffiti, nothing. I rushed straight home and locked the door behind me, tripping on couple of steps on my way up. 

I got in and locked the doors, nor daring to look out of any windows. I went straight to my room and laid on the bed, looking at the ceiling silently. For you all of this might sound tame and no reason to freak out, but after you spend so much time seeing the same things over and over again, and then suddenly overnight something new shows up, it can freak you out. 

I laid in my bed for I don't even know how long and I somehow managed to convince myself that I just imagined it, or that it was always there, I just didn't notice it. For some reason that worked and I found myself dozing off. 

I woke up the next day, and as it went on I almost completely forgot about the alley. That is, until time for work hit. I was thinking about calling in sick, but it just seemed silly to call in sick because or a minor incident that could have very well been a part of my imagination. 

I walked to work and as I neared the spot where the alley was I felt my body starting to tense up. When I got there the alley was nowhere to be found, just a wall where it was supposed to be. 

At this point I was sure I either lost my mind or just imagined the whole thing due to exhaustion. Work went as usual and when I was walking back home, I looked at the spot again and my blood froze. 

I was staring into an alley, just this time, it had someone... something in there. It vaguely resembled a humanoid but the creatures limbs looked bent and deformed. It stood there in a semi bipedal position, just looking straight ahead. 

I must have been transfixed by it because when I looked at my watch, over an hour had passed. When I looked back up, the alley was empty once more. 

I once again ran back home, doing my best not to scream from all of the stress and fear that has built up inside of me. I got into my home and rushed to my bedroom. I took the gun out of my drawer and put it next to me, I wasn't sure how the gun was going to help me but it made me feel safe, if only a little. 

I fell asleep later that night, passed out from exhaustion. I had nightmares about hundreds or thousands of those creatures sourrounding me, their eyes glowing crimson in the dark, stalking me, watching my every move. 

I woke up in a cold sweat and I was trembling. I took a shower, ate some breakfast and called in sick for work. I wasn't feeling well at all. I decided to relax a bit on my couch and watch some tv. I spent most of my day like that, eating snacks and binge watching a show on netflix, but my mind never left the creature. 

I was sure I wasn't imagining it this time, the creature looked so real and based on my watch I was standing there, transfixed on it for over an hour. As the night time came however, I felt that terrible feeling return to me, the feeling of being watched and not being able to do anything about it. 

I decided that I'll go and see if the alley is still there, after all last time I was there at this hour, going to work, it was gone. I made my way down and I saw something that made me run like nothing else in my entire life. 

I saw about a dozen alleys, they all had the same looking creature inside of them. It looked like they were feeding on something that resembled a human being, it was however shrouded in a thick layer of what seemed like black mist. 

As I stood there, too afraid to move, not wanting to make a sound, they all looked at me, in unison, with their deep crimson red eyes and smiled with their deformed lips. Fight or flight kicked in as I turned around and ran at speeds I thought weren't possible to achieve by me. 

I got home and that's where I'm writing this, I'm scared for my life, they saw me. What were they eating? It all remains unanswered for now, I couldn't find anything about it on the internet. 

I hope some of you can help me, or at least tell me what these creatures are, I'm scared and desperate for answers, I might be going crazy. I just hope I'm not their next meal.

This happened in spring of 2020. Around the time everything was shutting down and we had to stay home. 

My son had just turned 2 and was starting to speak in small sentences. For weeks he kept saying “ghost in chicken.” We thought it was just funny nonsense. 

So one evening my son and I were napping in my room…I woke up to my son crying and  squeezing me really tight. I asked him what was wrong and he was staring at the door…so I looked over and my husband was just standing there looking at us. 

I asked what he was doing and he just smiled and then put his arms out like he wanted our son to go to him. My son kept saying, “no no no no.” He’s usually clingy and only wants me when he first wakes up so I didn’t think anything of it. 

I got out of bed and picked up my son. He was doing a death grip around my neck and literally shaking. I kept asking him what was wrong but he just kept saying no. 

My husband left the room and I followed him and was asking him if he thought our son had a bad dream or something. I watched my husband go down the hall and turn into the kitchen. My son was freaking out so I put him down and he grabbed the back of my leg while I stood in the kitchen archway. 

I looked into the kitchen and my husband was sitting on the floor in front of the stove. I asked why he was sitting on the floor in the dark and he just had the biggest creepiest smile. Even though it was dark I just could tell his eyes looked black. 

I was like, ok, this is weird. So I picked my son back up and walked to the living room. My husband was on the couch with his laptop on his lap…like he had been there for awhile. 

I asked how the heck did he get from the kitchen to the living room so fast without me seeing him leave. 

He said what? I wasn’t in the kitchen…

I said yes you were. And told him I saw him sitting on the floor in front of the stove. He burst into laughter and said why would I sit on the kitchen FLOOR?! 

I asked if he was messing with me and he asked if I was hallucinating. I said I was absolutely was not and our son saw him too.  

I walked over to the couch and my son put his arms out to go to his dad, suddenly not afraid of him. Then my son said, “ghost in chicken!” 

I asked him where the ghost chicken was and he pointed in the direction of the kitchen. I asked, “you mean ghost in the KITCHEN?” 

He nodded. 

To this day I swear what I saw was real. I’ve never seen anything like that again but we do hear noises from the kitchen and things fall over a lot in there. I was even cooking one time and something flew off the pantry shelf and landed on the other side of the kitchen.

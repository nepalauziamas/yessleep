Before all this started, I never paid much attention to young people. I didn’t give a damn if they played their music too loud or walked across my lawn. They’d do their thing, I figured, and I’d do mine. But ever since a group of kids started stalking people–me included–I’ve begun to notice something very wrong with the youth in my town.

At first, I couldn’t put my finger on what it was.

But as I drove past a group of them, standing in a circle on a street corner, I realized what was so off about them: it was the *quiet*.

There was no music blaring from a portable speaker. No laughter or yelling or goofing off.

Just endless, silent staring. *What the hell were they waiting for?*

I drove into town to do my shopping with a stupid grin on my face and cheerful music on the radio–just in case they were watching *me*. It stuck in my craw, having to pretend that everything was fine after everything I’d seen, but I knew the alternative:

They’d already tried my doors and walked on my roof.

The next step? Probably popping the latch on a window or slipping under the garage door.

For all I knew, they’d come slithering up the damn sewer pipes.

It was getting harder and harder to keep up that fake smile.

Four kids were lined up in front of the woods across from the grocery store. In unison, they swiveled their hooded heads to watch each car roll by.

*If I looked in the rearview mirror, would I see that their necks twisted all the way around?*

I wasn’t sure I wanted to know.

Once I’d parked and gone inside the grocery store, I risked a glance out at the four preteens across the street. The chilly fall wind blew dead leaves against their sneakers, but they were as still as statues. I shuddered. Everyone in the beeping checkout lines was going about their business as though none of this was happening–well, *almost* everyone.

I saw the young cop who’d come by my house pushing a cart full of dry beans and rice like he was prepping for the apocalypse. *Maybe he was.*

The young cop pretended not to notice me when I waved, but I wasn’t taking *“no”* for an answer. He took off, and I went after him, pushing myself alone with my cane like a busted old locomotive. I guess he realized that an old guy chasing him through the supermarket was a lot more suspicious than stopping and having a quiet chat. He parked his overflowing cart by the restroom and nodded toward it.

Inside, the young cop pushed open the stall doors…checking to see if we were along?

*“What the hell do you think you’re doing?!”* He hissed. *‘Jim Kelly’* read his nametag.

“I could ask you the same thing.” I crossed my arms and stood between the cop and the door. “A shopping cart full of dry goods? Four teens standing by the road for hours *on a Tuesday morning,* and the cops do nothing? People are walking around scared of their own damn shadows!”

“They should be.” Officer Kelly whispered. He looked over his shoulder at the bathroom door. “You should be too. *We* don’t know what’s going on any more than you civilians. Orders from the top are to only investigate the cases that can’t be covered up…and to deny the rest.”

“*Cases?!”* my jaw dropped open. “My God, Jim–how many are there?!”

Officer Jim Kelly shrugged. “I don’t have access to that information. Look, I’m sure the higher-ups are handling…\*whatever this is…\*in the best way they can. The best thing you can do for yourself and for the people you care about is to keep your head down and not get involved. Can you do that for me, Mr. Hall?”

The bathroom door swung open: a deli shop employee running for the urinal.

The young cop and I pretended to wash our hands and went our separate ways.

When I pulled out of the parking lot, the four kids across the street were gone…or so I thought. As I turned the corner, I saw *seven* of them walking out of the trees. Their sneakers were filthy and the bottom of their jeans were caked with mud. They were walking with jerky steps toward an abandoned station wagon. It’s the driver’s side door hanging open and the emergency flashers were blinking…like someone had just been dragged out of it.

That settled it.

Officer Jim Kelly and his superiors were full of shit.

*Like hell I was going to sit back and wait for them to come for me!*

Sammy and the families who’d lived in those empty houses–*they* hadn’t noticed anything was wrong. *They* had gone about their business as usual, and what had it got them?

All of them were gone, and I didn’t want to imagine how.

Who else could I turn to? Who else might know what was happening in my town?

I just drove for a while. I didn’t have any particular place to go, I just needed to *think*, to stay away from my house… and to try to figure out how bad this was.

In every neighborhood I passed through, I saw at least one group of them: a pack of young people standing silently, *waiting.* For what, I didn’t know.

The high school parking lot was half empty, and no one played basketball on the courts after school. When I got closer to my own suburb, however, I reckoned I found an answer to my question: a pale teenager on an electric scooter, with hair that looked like a damn mop and music blaring from the phone hanging off of his neck.

I wouldn’t have noticed him at all, if it wasn’t for what was waiting for him up ahead.

He couldn’t see it from where he was, but up ahead the sidewalk narrowed and passed through the fence of a city park. That was where they were waiting: five of those silent, statue-still kids.

“Hey!” I shouted to the kid. Either he couldn’t hear me, or he was ignoring the weird old guy yelling something at him out of a passing car. He kept going…until he noticed *them.*

In the glow of the streetlight, I saw it all.

The way the silent kids blocked his path.

The way two more of them crept out of the woods, like they’d been *planning* this.

The look of panic on the pale teenager’s face when he realized there was no escape.

I couldn’t just watch this happen.

“HEY!” I yelled again. I pulled over near the park fence and pulled my .38 revolver from the glovebox. I limped toward the pack of kids.

They were a wide range of ages, anything from ten to seventeen. Some of them had sneakers worth more than my monthly Social Security check, while others wore oversized Wal-Mart clothes–and whatever was happening with these kids didn’t discriminate by race or gender.

The only thing they all had in common was the numb, slack-jawed look on their faces.

It was like their *bodies* were here, but their *minds* were off someplace else…screaming.

When I got close, they turned on me.

I won’t lie, when I saw them all move in unison like that…even their *footsteps*…I had second thoughts. I wondered if it might not be better to get back in my car, put on another black-and-white war movie, sip a cold beer and forget I’d ever seen the pale teenager with the mop haircut.

It’s hard to explain it, but there’s some kind of human connection that comes when you lock eyes with somebody. I wanted to back away, but that teenager on the scooter was looking right at me, and his eyes said *‘help!’*

“W-what’re you kids doing?” I tried to sound intimidating, but the words came out as a scared little squeak.

If they rushed me I was done for, and they knew it.

A white teenager with a square jaw, a muscular build, and a single diamond earring stepped forward from the group. I would’ve sworn I’d seen him before, but I couldn’t remember where…and besides, that slackened expression made all their faces seem similar. Suddenly the group surrounded the teen on the scooter, grabbing him–

*BANG.* I’d never fired my .38 outside of a gun range before. The noise was ear-splitting; it echoed off of the trees and nearby houses like a thunderclap.

It was a warning shot, straight up into the sky. I tried to keep my hands from shaking as I pointed it at the kid with the diamond earring. *Your move, chief.*

Without a word, the pack slunk away. The kid with the diamond earring walked backwards into the twilight behind them. Even when I couldn’t see his weird, mannequin-like face any longer, I knew he was still staring at me from out there in the dark.

“Uh,” the kid on the scooter with the mop haircut muttered, “thanks.”

When he turned to go, I grabbed his collar.

“Not so fast. When you saw those kids, you *recognized* them. You know who they are. You might even have some idea about what they’re up to. And before you go zooming off, you’re gonna tell me all about it.”

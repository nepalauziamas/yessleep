~**Application Letter**~

**We are proud to have you joining the mortel Circus soon**

**We hope you have a great time here in the "wonder-world" group, where you will be assigned the following:**

**Part of a double Act**

**Your costume is in the box this letter came with, don't forget to open it**

**Have a wonderful time with us**

#

I carefully opened the box, to find the costume 
Neatly folded at the bottom, a split pattern of purple and blue. 

I hastily put on the colorful outfit and headed straight to the circus, where I was greeted by a strange looking guy with a shiny green cape.

"Aha, the new recruit, nice to see you! I'm Jean Mortel, I'm the leader of This Beauty!""

"You too sir," I said nervously, "um, where exactly is everyone?"

"Aha! Follow me, they're exited to meet a new performer you see, so don't be expecting a calm welcome."

"I see."

#

I follow Jean to a big gold door, which was opened already.

"Hm, strange, no?" He says with a forced laugh.

#

As we entered the performance area, the group was around, practicing for a big show around the corner. Tightrope walkers, acrobatics, a shy puppeteer, a guy practicing slapstick humor, and a clown.

In the middle was a giant podium with a microphone on top, where I guessed Jean Spoke before every performance.

Suddenly, the puppeteer noticed me, and spoke in a quiet tone.

"H- Hey, the N- New guy is here"

"What, really, already?!"

"Lemme see!"

#

Suddenly I was bombarded with names, I couldn't even keep up with everything going on.

"Hey, I'm the Slapstick guy, my name is Harold, nice to see you!" He looked around 30 years old, with a loud, jolly voice, he held what was a prop saw.

"Welcome sir, I'm one of the tightrope walkers, and my name is Earl." he spoke In a soft, yet confident tone. He was still balancing on a low bit of string, yet keeping his tone in composure.

"Hey, do my name is Pearl, I'm the clown around here, such a pleasure!" She looked around 25 years old, with white makeup on, wearing a red nose, a trick flower was in her hand. Certainly the newest one apart from myself.

"Um, nice to meet all of you." I quietly spoke.

"Okay, let's start the new arrival's welcome with a wonderful feast!" Jean happily said.  

"Ah, I don't think I will, everything's quite new and I would love to see more of things." I explained.

"Sure, sure, go ahead and explore everything else."

#

I searched every nook and cranny for anything interesting, every room in the halls, every roof for an attic, anything to find out of curiosity.

Couldn't find much to say the least, but I did find somethings..

#

A collection of books, each having a number on them, with the name: Mysteries of beyond the Circus, knocked off their desk.

#

#

Book one:

**My time here is pleasant, I love this place, but there's an itch that I can't scratch about this place. I'm seeing for myself why I feel this way, but the lead [Jean] is hurrying along constantly, is he hiding something?**

#

Book two:

**A hidden passage is in the walls! I don't know where it leads, but maybe this is what Jean was so nervous about, got to keep digging**

#

Book three:

**Do not leave the Beds after Dark, they change into monsters, do not leave at all, my left leg is sawn off**

**Oh god why did I come here?**

#

Book four:

**Help help help help help help help help help help help help help help help help help help help help**

#

Book five:

**Beware the mortel**

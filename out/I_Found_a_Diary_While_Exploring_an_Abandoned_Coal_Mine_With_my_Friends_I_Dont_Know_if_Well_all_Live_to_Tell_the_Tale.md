I don't know why I ever agreed to come here. It was my friend Lilly's idea, a recommendation from her and our other friends. An innocent enough text was my invitation to join them on an expedition to an abandoned mine a little ways away from our town. It was a sleepy little place but still big enough that it wasn't a tight-knit community. I'm not sure if it's even on a map, but I will not be naming it on the off chance someone can find it and makes the same mistake I did. In my town, no one would notice if a couple of adventurous people had gone missing. I was a bit of a loner, preferring to go out into nature to enjoy the serenity and lack of people. Which is how I met Lilly, Gabriel, and Mark.

&#x200B;

Long story short, I ended up pepper spraying Mark in the face after he snuck up on me during my hike. I ended up tripping and spraining my ankle when Gabriel and Lilly came to find out what had happened, and that was where our friendship began. Lilly helped me walk back to our cars after I apologized for pepper spraying Mark. She offered to drive me to the urgent care to check out my ankle, while Gabriel said he could drive my car. Of course, this sounded incredibly suspicious, but I didn't have a choice. I didn't have the money to tow my car, my parents and I weren't on good terms after I moved away, and the ankle I damaged just happened to be my dominant one. I agreed, even though that was a world-class stupid decision, but I'm still alive, for the time being anyway. We ended up getting to know each other and exchanged numbers. I offered to show them around the town while pointing out activities they could try out sometime. Mark holds one hell of a grudge against me. Lilly says it's because I remind him of someone he ended on bad terms with, but she never went into detail. We were in the same boat there. I became a part of the group and started going on expeditions into the wilderness with the three, which led me here. Stuck in the lower areas of an abandoned coal mine with hundreds of thousands of pounds of rock pressing onto the Earth above me. I'm freezing, exhausted, hungry, and I want out. I decided to start jotting down my story. If I don't make it out, someone may find my phone and read this by some miracle. I'll start from the beginning of our day of hell on Earth.

&#x200B;

The four of us were in Lilly's car, girls in the front and boys in the back. We were less than five minutes from this abandoned mine they found. Lilly was nearly bouncing in the driver's seat, ready to stretch her legs after the hour-long trip.

&#x200B;

"This place looks huge! Mark and I barely made it ten feet in, and I knew we needed to wait to get you and Gabriel before coming back. I would say more, but I don't want to spoil it for you guys!" I giggled, listening to the childlike glee in her voice when describing this place.

"I'm sure it's great, but just calm down. We're almost there. I just want to know, are we allowed to go into the mine without getting trespassing charges, and is it safe?" Gabriel chimed in.

"Public land, and it's perfectly safe. It's not any more dangerous than our other caving adventures from before as long as you guys brought the correct gear," Mike informed.

&#x200B;

"In that case, triple-check to make sure you bought everything you need," I surmised as we pulled into the parking lot. I unbuckled my seat belt once the car was in park, pulling my long blonde hair into a ponytail and using my hairband to secure it. Everyone got out while getting ready for the short walk to the mine by grabbing their gear from the trunk and looking over it. I grabbed my pack and looked inside. Heavy duty rope? Check. Climbing anchors? Check. Gloves? Check. I continued with my checklist written on my phone. I reached the end of the list when I saw something at the bottom of my emptied bag. I didn't remember placing it there, but at the bottom of my bag was my army knife made of pure silver. It was gifted to me by my catholic grandfather before he passed away. He told me it would be my best protection against all forms of evil as God would watch over me as I wielded it. I brushed off the idea, gently putting everything back into my bag as Lilly called out to see if everyone was ready to go.

&#x200B;

"You ready for the best caving adventure yet?"

&#x200B;

"Yeah yeah, quit hyping this up! Let's just head in already, Shortie!" Mark responded with impatience, not even trying to hide it. Now, Mark and Lilly had this weird thing where Mark seldom called Lilly by her real name. She was always Shortie, Honey-bun, or some other quirky name to him. She didn't even mind, so I never said anything about it.

&#x200B;

As we headed closer to the mine, I couldn't help but wonder, what was so great about this place? We'd gone caving so many times before, and it didn't seem like anything would be different this time. Nothing was particularly intriguing in this town, and I doubted an abandoned mine would change that. I lowered my head, watching my steps as I started noticing something odd. They looked like bones, multiple of them scattered all over the landscape. I brushed it off, assuming it was just some wild animals. I should've listened to my gut and had us all turn around. No one else seemed to notice anything odd, but the growing dread formed a pit in my stomach. Something just didn't seem right. We reached the front of the cave, and I turned on my headlamp. There were tiny streams of water cascading off the walls, and the wooden beams seemed to be in good shape. This mine looked well maintained, even though Lilly claimed it was abandoned. Mark took a couple steps in, and Lilly and Gabriel followed. I took one last look back, not liking the foreboding feeling plaguing my mind, and followed their path.

&#x200B;

The three continued chatting as I stayed close behind. I heard Lilly's camera shutter clicking as she took pictures. It was an odd sight, it looked untouched, yet it was still in perfect shape. Time seemed to fly by as the light from the entrance disappeared. We ventured deeper into the mine, seeing the first signs of human disturbance. There were pickaxes, lamps, and minecarts, all just left behind. This should've been a red flag as any sane company in the late 90s to early 2000s wouldn't have left behind perfectly usable equipment. No one else commented on the strangeness of this, and I had to ignore it to catch up to them. I started noticing more exposed coal veins left untouched.

&#x200B;

"Woah! Come, quick guys, look at this!"

I turned away from the ores in the rock wall and turned to face Gabriel's voice.

"Wow, what is this?" Lilly hummed in fascination.

Lilly and Mark had already made it to Gabriel as I jogged to them. They had found an old wooden table, two chairs, a lamp, and a tattered leather journal. Mark picked up the journal and started carelessly flipping through the pages.

"Be careful! You might rip it."

Lilly snatched the journal from Mark's hands, scolding him for his behavior. She gingerly flipped to the first page.

"This diary belongs to Jonathan Dirk, 1998. If found, please mail to... ugh. The rest of the words are too smudged to read." She gave out a frustrated sigh before flipping to the next page.

She didn't read the rest to us and instead closed the journal with boredom and laid it back on the table.

"What else was in there, Ace?" Mark inquired, going to pick it back up before Lilly smacked his hand.

"Just a log of times in and out from work and boring stuff like that. Come on, let's keep going." She responded.

&#x200B;

Gabriel shrugged and followed Lilly as she wondered a couple feet farther. Mark rolled his eyes and gave one last look at the journal before pursuing the pair. I couldn't shake the curiosity. Maybe this journal was evidence of what happened to cause the mining crew to leave so abruptly. I glanced towards the three, watching them inspect the old gear. Once I knew they weren't looking, I gently grabbed the dairy and placed it in my bag. I decided to read it later and place it back before we left. I wish I had read it right then and there. I could've avoided this whole mess. I threw my bag back over my shoulder, walking to my friends.

&#x200B;

"Which way should we go next?" Gabriel inquired.

"We should take the path that leads deeper into the mine. The other looks like it may just lead pack up to the surface."

"Mark, there's a sign right there that says: 'Break room' I don't think it leads back up. Besides, we would've seen another entrance while scouting the area" Lilly shook her head, no doubt wondering how Mark missed the sign.

"Guys, maybe we've seen enough for the day. Something about this place doesn't sit right with me. We should head home and learn more about it before we go further," I chimed in.

Something just felt incredibly wrong with this whole scenario. Too many unanswered questions and red flags.

"This is the first time you've spoken up since we came in, and now you want to head back?" Mark scoffed at me.

"We won't go much farther. We just want to see a bit more before we go. Can't we stay just a tad bit longer?" Lilly pleaded with me. I've always had a soft spot for her, and I felt my resolve waver. She was like a little sister to me.

"I...Lilly, I don't know. Something isn't right here,"

"Please? Any other weird things, and we'll leave, I promise," Gabriel commented.

I debated the offer in my head. It couldn't be that bad to stay for much longer, right? I slowly nodded my head, silently agreeing.

"Thank you!" Lilly engulfed me in a hug.

I wrapped my arms around her as well. If only I had known, what would happen next. They continued debating before coming to an agreement. We'd go down the deeper path and circle back to the break room before we went home. I cursed myself for agreeing to this but didn't voice my opinion further. I followed suit as we started going down the deeper path. The signs of miners being here slowly started dissipating as we continued deeper. Lilly's camera shutter kept going off as she took more pictures.

&#x200B;

As the path started getting darker, we came to a cliff edge.

&#x200B;

A ladder leading farther down into the shaft was our only means of continuing forward. I became increasingly more uneasy. Why would there be a ladder here? Wouldn't it make more sense for there to be an elevator, so they could transport equipment up and down? I couldn't see the bottom from where I stood. I swung my bag over my shoulder, placing it on the floor. My group started arguing about going down. Gabriel was becoming uneasy too and didn't want to go any further, especially with my already frazzled state. I opened my bag and rummaged through it, pulling out a glow stick. I cracked it before shaking my hand back and forth to illuminate it. As my friends continued their debate, I dropped the now-lit glowstick down the tunnel, watching it bounce off the walls and fall further. I watched it hit the bottom of the ladder before rolling to a stop on the stony ground. It seemed to be 50 feet from our current position at the least. The ladder looked worn, and it seemed it would break the minute any strain was put on it. I was adamant about leaving at that point. This was becoming too dangerous, and nobody even knew where we were. If something went wrong, we were on our own. I began putting my backpack on, getting ready to leave. Suddenly, Lilly started to descend using the ladder. She didn't even create an anchor point to put her rope through.

&#x200B;

"Lilly, what are you doing? This isn't safe!" I went to grab her arms to hoist her back up.

"Don't touch me! I'm alright, and I'm going down. You can't stop me," I was shocked. She had never acted like this before.

"You're not even strapped into an anchor point. If you fall, you'll land at the bottom of the ladder! We won't be able to get you out," Gabriel began pleading with her.

We exchanged worried glances, watching her descent with bated breath.

Mark pushed us both out of the way, "move, we're both going down. Either you join us, or you don't."

&#x200B;

He gave us a glare and followed after Lilly. Gabriel and I just looked at each other, dumbfounded. What had gotten into the two of them? We continued watching their descent, and I heard the soft *click* of Lilly's camera at the bottom. At least she had made it down safe. I was torn, I wanted to make sure my friends were okay, and I needed to convince them to come back up. At the same time, however, something was incredibly wrong here. Lilly would never do this rationally, and even Mark would be more reasonable than this. So, I made the biggest mistake ever. I pulled out my rope and tied it to my harness. I gave the slack, a belay device, and gloves to Gabriel. He gave me a doubtful look.

&#x200B;

"What the hell are you doing? You can't seriously be going down there after them?"

"I can't let them go down there and get lost either, can I? I have to get them to come up" I returned a determined look, trying to hide the shakiness in my voice.

"Then I'm coming down with you-"

"No. I need you up here in case I can't make it back up. Once I get down there, try to find a place to put in some anchor points. If I need help getting back up fast, I'll tug on the rope three times. Got it?"

He nodded before responding, "stay safe, okay?"

&#x200B;

I gave a curt nod before starting down the ladder. My hands began shaking the farther down I went, and I kept thinking the rung under me would snap at any moment. But eventually, I made it down. I used my headlamp to scan my surroundings, but I saw no sign of Lilly or Mark. How did they get away so fast? I kept myself tied to the rope and began walking around, looking for any sign of the two. I went to call out but thought better of it. Something was off. I listened intently for any sound that may clue me into their location when I heard it.

&#x200B;

*Click.*

&#x200B;

It was too dark in here. What was there to take pictures of? I tiptoed over to the spot before bumping something with my foot. They were more bones. How were they this far into the cave? The bones were wrong. Before I could process what I saw, the little red splotch next to the bone caught my attention. Blood. Fresh blood too. Had Lilly or Mark been hurt? I saw more drops before they became more prominent. They gradually became smears, like someone or something had been dragged. I heard quiet mumbling in the distance and continued forward. A couple feet from where I originally heard Lilly's camera shutter, I saw Lilly. She was sitting on the floor, legs stretched out, staring into a tunnel just ahead. I ran to her, kneeling by her side. She was mumbling something incoherent.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Lilly, are you okay? Oh my god, what happened to your leg?"

"It's calling me Teddy. It wants its food."

"What? What are you going on about?"

"I heard it from when we first came here. It begged for food. It was so hungry. There hasn't been food down here in so so long."

Those sentences sent a chill down my spine. What the hell was she going on about?

*Click*.

"Lilly, seriously, you're freaking me out. What are you going on about?" There was a moment of clarity in her eyes, and she recognized me. Her eyes began to water.

"Teddy, I'm so so sorry."

"Hey, it's okay, you're okay. There's nothing to be sorry about. We're gonna get you patched up and get you home, okay?"

She shook her head violently as tears spilled down her face, "it won't let us leave. It wouldn't let us escape the first time unless we promised to give it food. And even then, we had to offer it something before we could go" she was full on blubbering at this point.

*Click*.

&#x200B;

The egregious wound prompted many questions. How in God's name would I get her back up? Would she ever be able to walk with that leg again? The biggest question, however: who, or more likely what, the hell did this? Her leg didn't look like an animal had attacked her. For that matter, it didn't even look like a human had attacked her. A long, deep gash went down her calf. I'm no doctor, but it was deep enough that I could see fat and muscle tissue. I was pretty sure her Achilles tendon had been severed. I knew this wasn't good. The amount of blood on the floor was significant, and I was terrified Lilly would go into shock if she hadn't already. Her skin was clammy, and her pupils were dilated.

&#x200B;

"Teddy, you need to leave."

"Huh? No, I am not leaving you behind. I'll go find Mark and have him help me get you back up," the cut on her leg didn't look clean. It was jagged like something with hundred of serrated teeth tore through the skin. The muscle and fatty tissue poking out from underneath looked equally damaged.

"Teddy, it's a trap. Let's face it, there's no way I'm making it back up, but you still have a chance. We never should've left the first time. You and Gabriel are in danger. You have to go!"

&#x200B;

Her outburst startled me, and I refused to face her. I took off my backpack and started rummaging through it for my emergency medical supplies. I wouldn't be able to fix her leg, but I had a splint I could use to try and restrict movement. I grabbed some gauze and hydrogen peroxide placing them down next to her. I began bandaging her wound, apologizing as she winced but tried pushing me away, begging me to leave her behind. I'd never seen her so distraught.

&#x200B;

*Click*.

&#x200B;

I finished bandaging her wound and continued looking for my splint, annoyed that she was still taking pictures.

"Lilly, where did Mark head off to? And for christ's sake, would you please stop taking pictures" my headlamp started to dim. Fuck, not now, please. It began to flicker when Lilly finally whispered:

"That's not my camera."

My blood ran cold as I turned to look at her and back to the area I last heard the camera shutter. Her eyes were wide and unblinking as she stared at a darker tunnel ahead of us.

"Lilly? Lilly, where are you?"

&#x200B;

I felt instant relief knowing Mark was close by. He must be using the flash from Lilly's camera to find his way. After all, I couldn't see the light from his headlamp. I would need his help getting Lilly back to the surface, and I didn't want to spend another moment down here with whatever did this to her. I was about to call out to him when Lilly's hand grabbed my arm.

&#x200B;

She mouthed the words, "that's not Mark."

I whispered quietly, "but it sounds just like him."

She shook her head, mouthing, "it can't be him. Mark's dead."

My head began swimming with questions.

*Click.*

&#x200B;

He was healthy and breathing less than 20 minutes ago, and now she's saying he's dead? There's no way she must be losing more blood than I thought.

&#x200B;

*Click.*

&#x200B;

I went to splint her leg after finding the needed materials. The dying light of my headlamp was making it significantly harder to render aid. I went to call for Mark again but stopped myself. The bloody drag marks I saw earlier went past Lilly. They went off into the tunnel ahead of us. She couldn't be the one who made them. She wouldn't have the strength to drag herself back here with how fucked up her leg was. She'd lost too much blood for that anyway.

&#x200B;

*Click*.

&#x200B;

Mark would never call Lilly by her real name either. Maybe once if he was genuinely concerned, but not twice. And if that really was Lilly's camera,

&#x200B;

*Click.*

&#x200B;

Why was there no flash? None of this made any sense. What was going on?

&#x200B;

I felt my panic start to rise, "Teddy? Was that you? Where's Lilly?"

&#x200B;

At that moment, I knew Lilly was right. Mark was dead. Not because the voice calling for us sounded blatantly wrong. Not because it sounded like something learning English, but not understanding the meaning of the words. Not because of the freshly fractured skull, picked clean of any flesh I found earlier. Not because it had the same serrated marks as the ones on Lilly's leg. Not because of the decapitated body I tripped over when backing up out of primal fear. Not because of the glass camera lens I fell on top of, cracking under my palm and slicing open my hand. I knew because of it. I don't know what name to give it. All I know is the terror I felt looking at its misshapen and malnourished body. It looked vaguely human, but it was wrong at the same time. Where a face should be, was one gaping maw with endless rows of tiny serrated teeth, two subtle holes for nostrils, and no eyes. Where ears should be were just holes. It was void of any hair on its body. Instead of walking upright, it wandered on all fours with massive arms that looked like enormous swords. Its legs bent at odd angles and resembled those of dogs instead of the human body it poorly imitated.

&#x200B;

My headlamp flickered and died, plunging the room into absolute darkness beside the faint light of the glowstick I dropped earlier. My eyes strained to see the beast's silhouette as its head appeared to lift in the air. It seemed to be searching for something or someone. Could it see us? Could it smell us? I knew it heard us earlier, so I stayed silent. However, I feared it might smell the blood oozing from my palm or Lilly's leg. I knew it had done that to her, but why hadn't it finished her off when it got the chance? I soon found my answer as a protruding shape appeared from the creature's back. Mark's climbing axe. He must've tried to kill it to save Lilly. I couldn't let his effort be in vain, but how would I manage to get the two of us out alive? It was an astronomical task, especially considering the state of Lilly's leg. I continued pondering these thoughts when I heard a slight creaking from the ladder. The creature must've heard it too. Its head turned towards the sound.

&#x200B;

*Click.*

"Lilly? Is that you taking a photo?"

Gabriel, you fucking moron, I told you to stay up there!

"Lilly? Lilly, where are you?" the thing imitated Mark's voice.

"Mark? Where's Lilly and Teddy?"

&#x200B;

I couldn't think of a way to tell Gabriel that he needed to go back up and fast without putting my own ass on the line. I realized my phone was still in my bag. The creature began wandering away from us and towards the ladder. Lilly's frightened eyes met mine, and I knew time was short. I rummaged through my bag as quietly as possible, grabbing my phone the second I felt it. Faster. I could hear Gabriel's descent closer this time. He was nearing the bottom. Faster. I flicked open my phone and went to messages. Faster. I scrolled to his contact, hitting it before typing:

&#x200B;

**'That's not us! Go back up, NOW! BRING HELP!'**

I hit send. But I wasn't fast enough.

**'Message could not be delivered.'**

&#x200B;

Gabriel's scream came seconds later as I heard his feet hitting stone. The sound faded away as he traveled farther and farther from us. I had little time to mourn. As sad as this was, now was my chance. I heard the creature's clicking fading away. It had followed Gabriel. It was time to act,  so I swung my pack over my shoulder, racing to Lilly's side.

&#x200B;

"I can't carry you; we both know that. Can you make it to the ladder if you use me as a crutch?" She looked pale as a ghost.

&#x200B;

I didn't wait for her answer as I grabbed her arm and hoisted her up. A good portion of her weight fell on me as I shuffled towards the ladder. When we made it, I grabbed a spare harness and belay device from my bag, retying my rope to her instead. After a hard yank on it, the slack was at the bottom by my feet. It was still looped through something at the top, and I said a silent thank you to Gabriel. I looked for anywhere I could insert at least one anchor point and found a crack in the stone wall.

&#x200B;

*Click*.

Shit, had it really made it back that fast? I fumbled with my anchor points before securing them. I ran the slack through them before pulling the rest through my belay device. I proceeded to put on my gloves.

"Lilly, I'm gonna hoist you up as far as possible. You'll need to pull yourself onto the ledge, okay?"

*Click.*

It was getting louder. Not waiting for an answer, I began pulling on the rope. Lilly looked like she was on another planet.

*Click.*

It's getting close, and I need to work faster. I began jumping and pulling on the rope even harder. Lilly was rising increasingly quickly until I couldn't see her silhouette anymore.

*Click.*

Fuck I don't know if she'll make it up in time.

*Click.*

&#x200B;

A couple minutes later, my hands became raw and bloodier than before. The cuts from the camera lens were even worse than before, but my hard work paid off. I went to pull again, quickly becoming exhausted when I felt resistance. I  let the rope slip a little and felt it move and then stop. The pressure dissipated, and I cautiously let go of it entirely. I didn't hear any screaming nor any sounds to indicate falling. I trusted that Lilly had pulled herself onto the ledge.

&#x200B;

*Click.*

&#x200B;

I turned to the sound before quickly removing my harness. I grabbed my bag, deciding to leave the gear there in case of a miracle where I could make it back. I picked up the glow stick and began blindly running down the tunnel the creature emerged from. Stupid, I know, but I didn't have many other choices. I ran for seemingly hours. It was probably less than thirty minutes as the clicking faded. I found a small crevasse I took refuge in. I caught my breath and listened for any noises. My chest ached, and my lungs burned, but I was alive. It was then that it hit me. My best friends were most likely dead. Mark was dead for sure, I had no clue how Gabriel could've survived, and Lilly was bleeding out near the surface with no help coming. My eyes began to water, and I put my head in my hands, wishing I could go back in time and change my choices. I passed out.

&#x200B;

Maybe an hour later, I woke up, knowing I would die down here. I began rummaging through my pack for my emergency supplies to survive a little longer. Instead, I felt an odd texture brush against my fingertips. Puzzled, I grasped the object, pulling it out of my pack. I had completely forgotten about taking the journal with me. I was still incredibly shaken up and decided to read it to hopefully calm my nerves. I will transcribe what was written in the journal, skipping the 'time spent at work' page.

&#x200B;

This Diary Belongs to Jonathan Dirk, 1998

&#x200B;

My first day of work in the mines was fine. Everyone was cold for the most part and only conversed in small groups. I still hadn't formed a bond with my coworkers, so I kept to myself. Something doesn't feel right about this place.

&#x200B;

Something woke me up really early this morning. It sounded almost like scratching. I had trouble sleeping after that. Later that day, I asked some of the other crew about it, but everyone avoided answering me. Everyone except for one guy. He seemed a little broke in the head, saying it was the ancient one. He kept saying it was hungry and wanted to feast on us. Really offputting shit, y'know? The rest of the day was typical, and I started talking to some of the other guys on the crew. I still couldn't brush off that weird feeling from yesterday.

&#x200B;

I got woken up by that scratching again this morning. This time I noticed that creep from yesterday was also awake, staring at a wall. I turned over and tried to get some more sleep, but he started mumbling. Something about how it was almost time for the great feast. I managed to fall asleep at some point and began my routine as usual.

&#x200B;

(The subsequent entry is from three days after) Some really bizarre shit is going on here. After my last entry, I went to work as usual. I was relatively successful that day. But then the blast team came running over saying something about a massive cliff in the other room they blasted open. They said it looked promising, open viens sitting in the walls on the way down. It took another two days before we could even make it down there. We had to make a super long ladder to even reach the bottom. Everyone was uneasy, and I don't think anyone wanted to go down. It was incredibly dark. Some crazy bastards volunteered to go down there. The four of them were doomed from the beginning. We could barely hear them once they reached the bottom. We could make out a couple words.

&#x200B;

"There's \*\* \*\*\*\* coal!"

"\*\*\* \* damn goldmine down here"

"we're \*\*\*\*\* \*\* rich!"

&#x200B;

They sounded excited, but then the tone changed.

&#x200B;

"Do \*\*\* hear \*\*\*\*?"

"\*\*\*\*, \*\*\*\* \*\*\* fuck \*\* that?"

"\*\*\*nds \*\*\*e scratching..."

&#x200B;

I heard that last part loud and clear, and I started to shake. Someone yelled down:

&#x200B;

"Guys, you can come back up now! We'll tell the boss what you saw, and they'll make an elevator so we can bring supplies down!"

"O\*a\* \*e're \*o\*\*ng \*p!"

"OH M\* G\*\* W\*AT T\*\* FUCK! \*HAT AR\* YOU!?"

&#x200B;

All we heard after that was screaming. Blood-curdling screams and then... silence. It didn't last long, as then the squelching began. Cracking, slurping, chewing. Everyone stayed silent, exchanging glances. And then, in clear yet garbled English:

&#x200B;

"We're coming up."

&#x200B;

*Click.*

&#x200B;

It wasn't scratching I'd been hearing. It was clicking. We all backed away and ran to tell our boss what was happening. When we reached his room, we were all talking at once, not making any sense. When he got us to calm down, one guy went to speak when the creep from earlier chimed in.

"It needs to eat. It'll only be satisfied for so long by a measly four."

We all stared at him in disbelief. This dude was batshit crazy.

"We must offer it more. Or we all will die."

&#x200B;

No one spoke for the longest time. The boss made eye contact with two burly men, our supervisors most likely. They began advancing on the guy before escorting him out of the office. We were all dumbfounded by what had just occurred. And no one thought to wonder where they were taking the insane man. It was getting late, and we were all exhausted and traumatized by today's events, so we went to our rooms. I think everyone woke up this time. Because it wasn't clicking anymore, it was a bone-chilling wail that assaulted our ears this time. That was three hours ago. The clicking is getting louder, and I think it made it up here somehow. I can hear it, knocking over our things, rummaging around.

&#x200B;

It's hungry, and it needs more.

&#x200B;

The rest of the diary is incoherent scribbles with splotches of dark brown on the remaining pages.

&#x200B;

And that leads me to the present day of a caving trip gone wrong. We were doomed from the start of this adventure, just like those four who came down here to find coal. I don't know what happened to the evidence of the bloodshed I can only assume followed the last entry of the journal. I only know that I will die either by the creature or by withering away to nothing, with just a skeleton left here. I don't want to die like this. But I don't know how I can escape. Mark is dead, Gabriel is missing, and Lilly is dying, cold and alone, 50 feet above me, unable to get help. But I can't help her from down here.

I allowed myself to let out a shaky breath, hesitantly peeking my head around the wall of the crevasse. Silence. I needed to act now. I wouldn't be able to make my way out by audio alone. I need light. I took a gamble and grabbed a new battery for my headlamp. I replaced the old one. With shaky hands, I turned on my headlamp.

&#x200B;

Nothing.

&#x200B;

The creature wasn't near me. How was I ever going to find my way out of here? My hand slipped on the rocky wall as I quickly learned my answer. Like a bread crumb trail, drops of blood littered the hallway. I thanked whatever God I could think of in my head. Swinging on my backpack, I quietly crawled out of the crevasse. I got up and started following the blood droplets back to the ladder. I took occasional glances behind me to ensure I wasn't being followed. And I covered a fair amount of ground. The tunnel started widening out as I took one more look behind me. I tripped. I scraped my hands, trying to cover my face on the way down. My headlamp clattered to the ground, dying out as it did. Luck really just was not on my side today. I prayed the monster wouldn't hear me as I scrambled back up. Making a break for the ladder, I heard a sound I dreaded.

I broke into a dead run at that point, giving up on all quietness.

"Teddy, is that you?"

I trembled listening to this thing pronounce my name. It sounded like a distorted record being played backward. I heard it running as it started a hot pursuit of me. There was no way I would make it back to the ladder in time, but I pumped my legs, giving it my all. My vision became fuzzy as I exhausted all my energy. The ladder was nearly in sight.

It was so damn close when I felt something roughly yank my shoulder.

"Teddy, what the hell? Why are you so freaked out?"

My eyes slowly opened, landing on Mark's tattered form.

"Mark? But I saw you...you were dead!"

"Is this some kind of joke? I went on my own to continue exploring while Shortie waited for you and Gabriel to get down here."

"No, I saw your decapitated body. If it wasn't you, who was it?"

"God, stop overreacting. I heard Shortie taking pictures like crazy, no way you guys were that freaked out. Speaking of, where is she?"

"You heard Lilly taking pictures?"

*Click.*

"Yeah, didn't you just hear her?"

*Click.*

"Mike, that wasn't Lilly. We need to go. NOW."

*Click.*

I went to yank his hand, trying to pull him with me towards the ladder. He pulled away, pushing me towards the ladder.

"God, what the hell is your problem. We invite you into our friend group, spend time with you, take you out places. And this is how you repay us? Trying to ruin our trips and leave us behind?"

*Click.*

I slowly backed away from him as he continued his rant about how awful I was. He didn't notice the terror filling my eyes. Nor the fact that I was paying no attention to him. I couldn't take my eyes off the thing behind it, and I swear, it smirked. It fucking smirked. It was daring me to tell Mike, to try and save him. But I knew I couldn't. If I attempted to save him, we would both die. I couldn't die, not now. Lilly needed me, and if by some miracle Gabriel was alive, he needed me too. I was the only one who could get us all help. And so, I continued backing away, watching as my friend turned around and came face to face with the creature. He screamed. God, he wouldn't stop wailing. He begged me to come back, to save him. And I almost did. Even as his blood splattered my face and stained my clothes, I thought maybe, just maybe, I could save him. And then I thought of Lilly. Of her bleeding out and struggling to survive as her oxygen-deprived brain tried to protect itself. So I turned away from the sight of Mark's skin being stripped from his body like it was dried Elmers glue. I turned away from him while he begged for mercy before an agonized scream rang out. But I'll never forget seeing his organs removed from his body, suckled on, and chewed to shreds. I'll never forget watching that creature tear half his face effortlessly from his skull. And I'll never forget watching the life drain from his eyes, as I ran for the ladder like a coward and began to ascend.

&#x200B;

I made it to the top to find Lilly, barely breathing but by some miracle, alive. I hoisted her up once again, walking her to the car. I leaned her against it before rummaging through her bag to find her keys. I grabbed them, unlocking the car and putting her inside before taking off to the hospital.

That was three days ago. I had to file a missing person report for Mark and Gabriel, making up a story with some truth to it. However the cops couldn't give a plausible explanation for what had cut Lilly so badly, and neither could I. No one could explain the lack of bodies and blood in the cave despite the blood evident on my clothes. We all knew a violent attack had taken place, but no one could give construct a full picture of the events that took place. After things had calmed down a bit, I finally touched my bag for the first time in days. It's only now that I've seen the bottom of my bag, which had a decently sized hole. I can't find my knife, and I pray to God that Gabriel is still alive. If he is, I hope he finds my knife and can make it out alive. I'm thinking about going back in to try and find him. I have hope that he's still alive. If I go back I may not make it back, and it's less likely that I will tell the story of how it went. I'm not used to sharing things with strangers on the internet, even less so when it comes to unsettling events. But there's one thing that's bugging me and I don't know how to stop it.

&#x200B;

In the early hours of the morning, every day since I escaped that mine someone wakes me up. It sounds like they're scratching at something. I can hear it right now.  I'm gonna go make sure my doors and windows are locked in case they try anything. But upon intensely listening I know that can't be a person making that noise. What should I do? Thanks for any and all advice! I just heard it again, it sounds like a camera shutter going off.

So, last night I waited a little too late to bring my dog out for a walk. Going too far into her favorite trails was out of the question in the dark, because I've seen a coyote hanging around that area at night a few times. I think it's the same one, he's a big boy. Haven't really seen any others as big as him.

For context, I live in a city in the northwest. Kind of in a more quiet area compared to downtown, but slightly alarming things have started happening here lately. Anyway, I say all his because it's not like super normal to see coyotes in this area. Really freaked me out the first time I saw him. So yea, it feels a bit strange to me. Something is off about it. I get the feeling sometimes that things are not always right here. If that even makes sense. Let's just say I've seen some weirdass shit that's kinda unexplainable.

So, I took her a different way and let her sniff everything she wanted. Let her really sniff around like the little terrier she is. She loves it.. it provides just as much stimulation as a brisk walk for her. So I decided to cross the street and make our way to the disc golf park which she loves. She sniffed around quite a bit and changed paths a few times, but we eventually made it. Streetlights lit part of the trail along the side of the park. Apartments lined the right side, slightly obscured by trees and bushes. Park was netted off on the left side. Past the streetlights, I saw solid darkness. I had an uneasy feeling, but I sometimes find fear thrilling. So I continued on. Like a dumbass.

Grace, my dog, was having a blast. I could hear the light clang of Frisbees hitting goal posts or whatever they're called, I don't give a single shit about sports to be frank. Grace pulled us forward and closer to the darkened part of the path. I let her sniff around where the light was fading, and debated on going further. I looked into the darkness. Dread filled my gut, an immediate anxiety induced stomach ache set in (thanks IBS). I knew we had to leave. I saw two small lights as I looked more closely, then they suddenly went out. Then came back on again just as suddenly.

They.. blinked. It was a pair of eyes. There was something in the darkness 20 feet ahead, and it was looking right at us. There's absolutely no way it was human.

I quietly began to lead Grace in the opposite direction, and I suddenly became unable to move. I saw gruesome images in my mind, things that I cannot even repeat or replay in my head, because I vomit anytime I visualize it. It was the most terrified I've ever been. Until I heard the voice. It slithered and slipped into my mind without making a sound. I was still paralyzed as it spoke to me.

"Pesky intuition," it hissed, "I almost had you." And I nearly shit myself. 

The hold was quickly released, and I signaled Grace that it was time to run. Run the fuck away from whatever the fuck that was. As we were leaving the park, I heard whistling somehow coming from every direction. And this is weird as hell but... it was randomly whistling "Sail" by AWOLNATION. No clue why, seems hella random. Grace was slowing down a bit, and we were already by the entrance of the park so I just matched her speed and we fast-walked right the fuck outta there.

As we made our way home, I was on guard and jumpy. I heard a noise, and then saw someone across the street repeatedly screaming "cold juice" into an intercom outside of an apartment complex. Ahh, I thought, normal city sounds again.

I made a mental note not to take her out at night anymore. She has a potty pad and uses it on super rainy days and stuff. She'll be fine with earlier walks as the days grow shorter and the sun goes down sooner. I tried to eat something but absolutely couldn't stomach a thing. I was really shaken and doubting myself on what I'd experienced. I took a sleeping pill and passed out.

When I woke this morning, I still wasn't hungry at all. Figured I'd force myself to eat a snack a little later while at work. I don't really eat much in the morning anyway. I started making coffee when my parter came out of our room. He went outside for a smoke. I set the coffee to brew and joined him. We both silently scrolled through reddit as we tried to wake up.

"Oh shit," he said, "this is right the fuck by us holy shit" and passed me his phone with concern. "Promise me you'll he careful and absolutely don't go out alone in the dark if you can help it. Please."

"I promise 100%, I absolutely won't be going out after dark without you," I said while looking at the article. There was a picture of a very young looking brunette girl with a dog on her lap, both smiling and happy. The dog looked so loved. You could see the bond between them through the picture. I took a second to take it in, because I suddenly felt very connected to this girl and her dog. I feel the same bond with Grace.

The text below the grainy photo was horrifying. I'm paraphrasing, but the girl, we'll call her Therasa, was 12 years old and snuck out with the dog to take him on a secret walk or something. Parents had no clue. Fuckin kids man, we were all so goddamn weird and stupid during that time in our lives. So it seems that she snuck out and walked to the disc golf course, where she then disappeared. Her dog's leash and collar were found at the park. In the same spot where I saw the eyes.

It seemed police already thought they had a lead; they also found a tent and supplies which obviously belonged to a homeless person. They seemed to think this person kidnapped Theresa and ran away with her. But I know that's not what happened.

First off, I've been homeless before. No homeless person willingly just abandons all their shit. Literally their only possessions... no. It just doesn't fuckin happen.

Second, I just know. I know it was the thing with the eyes. I can feel it. The tent camper had to have fallen prey to it as well. That girl is long gone... and her dog. What I felt, beyond the terrible images, was that it consumes every last bit. The feeling of blinking out of existence, I somehow felt that. I think it left the collar and leash to toy with me. To give me solid proof that Theresa took my place last night.

I don't know what this thing is, but I do know I sure as fuck won't be going out in the dark ever again. I'm so sad for Theresa's family, but I know telling them any of this shit would make things worse. So I'll remain silent, try to put it out of my mind. Except I keep feeling this nagging guilt. If it had taken me instead, would it have moved on before taking the child? I can't get the question out of my head.

Did a child die because I followed my gut instinct? Fuckin hell.

And even through that guilt I know, the terrible truth is that I'd do it the same every time. For Grace.

I'll always hate myself a little for that. But I do it for the pup. She's my life. Gotta protect her. Gotta keep myself alive to take care of her. It's how I get through my worst days.

Whatever you do, don't go to disc golf parks in the dark. Maybe just avoid public parks altogether at night, just to be safe. And most importantly, follow your gut instincts. Your intuition is invaluable. Trust yourself. Never forget that.

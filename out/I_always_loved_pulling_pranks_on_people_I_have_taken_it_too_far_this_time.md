My addiction to pulling pranks on people started when I was very young.

The first prank I ever executed was in elementary school. I walked up to one kid named Marcus and told him that another student had called him a chicken. A fight ensued during recess an hour later. 

The next day, the teacher gathered us together and performed an investigation. It did not take long for the two combatants to tell their side of the story. The kid who threw the first punch brought up my name as the instigator. I apologized. While it may seem innocuous, this is a guilt-ridden memory in my later years. 

I did not learn my lesson though. I never quit devising pranks. The older I got, the more secretive and strategic I became with the art of mischief.

As an adult, I developed a reputation for whimsy and occasional annoyance. Not everybody has a good sense of humor. Some people see those who enjoy pranks as being immature. I disagree. I am not infantile, but I am allergic to having idle hands. 

This extended to the workplace. I would tie phone cables in knots. When the cubicle workers went to answer their phones they were unable to put the receivers to their ears.

I also placed fake props on cars to see the bewilderment and frustration on the owner's faces. 

I grew up in a rough neighborhood and used this to my advantage. I knew how to sneak around with stealthiness comparable to military personnel. I would often step behind my friends and blow air down their necks. This was sometimes dangerous. A few times I got hit, but it was worth it. 

Some found it unbelievable that a man in his mid-20s could gain such amusement with acts so asinine. I always referred them to the viral videos of those who did it for a living on YouTube. 

This is the tale of the prank I regret the most.

One December day after work I went drinking with a friend of mine named Sean. Snow fell outside. After a few old-fashioned whiskeys were finished, he looked at me and I noticed he had grown somber. 

“Remember that time you put the chair on the other side of the bathroom door when I was using it? You trapped me in there.”

“Yeah,” I said with a laugh. “You were stuck for ten minutes. You were so mad. Glad we can laugh about it now.”

“Remember when you super glued Julia’s desk drawer? She struggled so hard to open it.”

“Oh yeah. Her attitude towards me changed after that. She’s held it against me ever since.”

“You know that bastard Andrew Sommer? He got a promotion last month.”

I did. Sommer was the typical artificial corporate stooge. He puffed himself up to be known as glorious. He maintained a plastic veneer when it suited him. Although I did not like him, I only had to rarely deal with him. I heard stories about how insufferable he was.

“He took the supervisor position overlooking the loan documentation specialists,” I said. “I don’t know the man, but the executives praise him.”

“You’re lucky,” Sean said. “He ended up in the position that I should have had. I applied for it months before he did.”

“I’m sorry to hear.”

“And he had the nerve to rub it in my face,” he said.

“Some people are too competitive.”

“No, this goes beyond that. He is a creep. He worked for this company once before, and he harassed women in the workplace. It’s why he quit almost a decade ago. He came back when the turnover rate was high and sucked up to the big bosses. Somebody in one of the higher offices ended up scrubbing his record. They didn’t even know about his past when they rehired him. All those women left the company a long time ago." 

"Wait for him to get written up or call in a bunch or receive another severe complaint," I said. "You’ll be on a direct path for the position he leaves behind. It’s only a matter of time before he gets drunk on the power and starts repeating the same patterns of behavior.” 

“I can’t wait that long,” Sean said after he finished another whiskey in one gulp. “ I need you to prank him. I want you to do it without a trace. I don’t care how petty it is. I want it to be humiliating for him. I need you to film it and upload it to social media.” 

“I don’t know man,“ I said. “I respect you and want to help you, but you’re asking for a lot. What if his family has a good lawyer?"

Sean reached into his pocket and pulled out stacks of bills. 

“I can’t think of a better way to spend this money than to pay you for doing me this favor," Sean said.

I tracked Sommer’s daily routine from that point on. He always parked on the third floor of the company’s garage structure. After he clocked out, he would go to a convenience store next to the office building. He always bought a twelve-pack of beer to bring home.

During my commute, I found a dead raccoon on the side of the highway. I went to a CVS and purchased a pair of latex gloves and a trash bag with a sealed top. I went back to the scene of the animal’s death, put it in the bag, and placed it in my trunk. 

Early in the morning on my day off I super glued the roadkill to the top of Sommer’s hatchback. 

I also put a liberal amount of crazy glue on the inside of the driver-side door handle. I knew it was unlikely his hand would get stuck. I also reasoned it would be a massive inconvenience and would lead to some kind of outburst.

I had inside information that many of the cameras in the structure were not functioning. My daily friendly banter with a lot of the security guards on duty gave me this insight. It was convenient to only have to worry about witnesses and not surveillance.

I hid in a stairwell across the way and kept the door cracked open with my phone in hand. I waited there for fifteen to twenty minutes. Sommer came around the corner and walked towards his car.

He saw the gruesome spectacle propped on the hood of his vehicle. His first reaction was to look around and see if anyone else was in the vicinity. After he acknowledged what was before him, he stomped his feet. His tantrum looked pathetic to me. 

He then pulled out his phone and tried to call someone. It might have been one of the guards to get an investigation going. He was on hold for a long while. After he failed to connect, he put the phone back in his pocket. 

He attempted to open the door after he turned his key. He cursed as he ripped his hand away and stared at the viscous substance on his fingertips.

He went into his rear cargo after he put down his pack of beer. He retrieved a baseball bat. He neared the side of the vehicle and poked at the animal carcass with the end of it.

He jabbed the deceased thing so hard that the entire back of its flesh tore apart as the rest of the body fell to the side. Maggots crawled out once the cadaver hit the concrete. As they slithered in all directions, Sommer tried to put his key back into the door. He made the same mistake again of dunking his hands in the super glue. 

He screamed and even kneed the passenger side out of sheer frustration. After his leg hit the metal, he winced in pain and backed up.

Sommer cussed and tried to stabilize himself on the railing of the parking garage. He slipped on a patch of ice and did an awkward dance in a feeble attempt not to collapse. I saw a shoe strike the rotted body of the raccoon before he slipped again.

He landed face first onto the sidewalk two stories down.

I had two immediate reactions. I stopped recording and deleted the video on my phone. I went down to the first floor, got into my car, and drove out of the parking garage. 

On my way to the main road, I looked to my left and saw Sommer’s body. His head had split open. Bone fragments had scattered everywhere. His face appeared as though it suffered a shotgun blast at close range. 

Nausea overcame me. I started to heave. Terror became my bedfellow. How long could I pretend as though I was not culpable? When will the police find forensic evidence of my hair at the scene? When would they knock on my door and change my life forever? They would run back footage on the few cameras which were functioning. They would wonder what I was doing there in the first place on my Saturday. My life became one long drawn-out legal punishment that hung over me like the darkest of specters.

Then the guilt set in. The shame I felt in conjunction with the pure reality I knew I would have to face overwhelmed me.

Days went by. I was smart enough not to Google the incident. I had seen enough true crime documentaries to know killers did research their murders. This always backfired on them.

I did not tell anyone, not even Sean. My family noticed a change in me. I was distant and preoccupied with something they could not know about. I would never tell them. I knew they would have to find out the hard way as soon as they sent me to jail.

Before I went to bed, I usually did a perimeter check around my house. I walked down the hallway back to my bedroom. 

I would have sworn I saw a man without a face standing by the threshold of my doorway. 

I turned and threw a left jab at the shadows. When nothing sprung back at me, I turned on the light after I grabbed a canister of mace I kept in my closet. I did a thorough check of the house again and did not find anything. 

I could not get rid of the nagging feeling of fear. This would not be the last time I saw the familiar figure in my periphery.

I did stumble on news coverage of the incident.

Every media outlet got it wrong. They labeled the event as a suicide. They revealed how Sommer lost money in various trend-oriented investments. He had an addiction to various kinds of anti-anxiety medications. 

This did not ease any weight off of my shoulders. What if his wife or one of her friends noticed the glue patterns on the hood? How long before somebody started asking questions about a dead animal in an area? Another part of me did entertain the idea that no one cared about him enough, horrible as that may have been.

I ate less and grew unmotivated to engage in any of my usual hobbies. Trips to the movie theater and the occasional visit to the local bar were all distant memories.

One night I had a dream. In it, I walked along a golden pathway with a moat on both sides. At first, it was peaceful and serene. Sommer leaped out of the waters at me, his face half-removed and fractured and slimy with gore. I punched him in the throat. He buckled and went to the ground. I tried to run backward so as not to lose my gaze on him. He crept back to his feet and sprinted towards me.

I woke up covered in sweat. My wife later told me that I screamed. She asked me if everything was alright. Nothing was, but I had to lie to her.

My nocturnal reveries gained consistency. Sommer was present through all of them. It did not matter if it was a work-related stress dream or a mundane one. He was always there at some juncture. His cracked-open face leered at me with a grim countenance. His appearance was as though an ax had fallen down the center of his forehead. He always laughed as he chased after me.

In one of the dreams, I was walking onto a steep concourse filled with dying grass. Sommer ran at my heels, dove headfirst like he did the day he fell to his demise and grabbed my ankles with both hands.

I looked behind me to gaze at the disgusting facial expression that was brain matter.

“Do the right thing,“ Sommer said.

When I snapped out of the realm of somnolence, I felt a certain kind of relief that I never had before. It was born from my fantasy of bringing justice upon myself.

The idea of never seeing the outside world again was daunting. Then I reflected on how I was not able to enjoy the world right now as it was because of my torment and fear. I worried about him plaguing me forever.

*I will turn myself in soon,* I thought as I went into the parking lot of my workplace. I looked at the spot where he died. I sat in my car and knew I would go to the police station and tell them everything. I got out of my car, and still felt obligated to complete my shift.

*Soon. Soon.*

We called it the great blinding. Only, There was nothing great about it. Our world was struck with endless darkness, taking away the thing we all took for granted. It happened within seconds. I was with my brother and wife when my vision went black. At first, I thought that somehow my eyes had closed without me noticing, maybe I was sleepier than I had initially thought. My mind flooded with any thoughts I could produce, to rationalize the current darkness that's engulfed my surroundings. When my ears were filled with the shrieks of my wife, “I CAN'T SEE! JAMES,  I CAN’T SEE!” 


My blood going ice cold I realize I'm not the only one. As the days passed we came to learn the entire world met the same fate. To carry out their lives without sight. At first, adapting was extremely difficult. We spent the first couple of weeks stricken with despair and confusion. Everyday tasks, like cooking, or using the bathroom turned into a challenge.


But within a few months, whole communities and support groups formed by people who were blind before this disaster occurred had helped and taught us how to perform everyday tasks and bypass our newfound obstacles. As more time passed, The progression of our new world flourished. We figured out new ways of transportation as well as making certain accommodations in the workplace.


It's been two years since the blinding. There are times when this occurrence had slipped my mind. This was the new normal and It felt like we had lived like this our entire lives. 


Until one day, I had awoken in my bed. Groggily forcing my body to rip itself away from the warmth of my pillow. I sat up and opened my eyes to see the blurry bright light shining through the curtains. I can see. My eyes welled with tears as I was about to turn to my wife I realized the writing.


Evrey available wall, floor, and dresser had been painted with the same message. “Don't tell them you can see” My heart began to race, the tears that had been rolling down my cheek now motivated with fear and confusion instead of bliss I whipped my head around to wake up my wife, to beg her for answers. To receive the ever-loving reassurance she's given me many times before...


But only... That's not my wife. 


As I observed the grotesque creature that lays beside me I try to produce a scream but before it could escape my lips something inside me ripped it away barring it deep within my body leaving me alone to do nothing but sit here frozen in terror. As I watch this...this thing that's now inhabiting the spot where my wife once layed. I realize it's awake. Watching me with those chilling red eyes that look exhilarated at the newfound realization that I can see it. I watch the speed of its breath increase with excitement as what I presume is it’s mouth curves up into a grotesque smile. Rows of sharp teeth come into view, its deformed body lifts itself from the bed leaving behind a black sludge that's dripping from its gaping stomach. Its skin is tightly pulled across its unnaturally lengthy figure. It resembled a dirty black rubber glove that was too small for its wearer's hand, so it ripped and tore free from the tension of forcing it on something it did not fit. Wounds agape all over its body as if it forced itself into the skin it's wearing. It leans over me and I'm met with a revolting smell that immediately assaults my nostrils. It places an inhuman hand on my shoulder leaning closer to my face until were nearly inches apart. With a sharp inhale to speak, eyes frenzied in the exitment that it's about to indulge itself in and with that same godforsaken smile it says, “what's wrong honey?”

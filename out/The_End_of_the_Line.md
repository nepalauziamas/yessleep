This is the scariest thing that has ever happened to me.

I was in a car accident and woke up in the hospital completely paralyzed.
I thought I was dreaming and the doctors were making me believe I was paralyzed, but when I realized I was actually paralyzed, I thought for sure I was going to die.

Then I heard about this new device that lets paralyzed people talk to their loved ones by translating their thoughts into words on a screen, and I was so excited.

My doctor wrote in my file that I was to be hooked up to the device as soon as possible, and today I was.

It was amazing.

My family and I were all crying.
My loved ones told me that my baby girl was still learning how to talk and that she asked where I was.
I was able to tell my wife that I loved her and that I wanted her to promise to take care of our daughter the best she could.

But then it got weird.

My family asked me if I was in any pain, and I said no, which was a lie.
I was in a lot of pain.
The morphine was helping, but I was still in pain.
But I didn't want to worry them, so I lied and said I wasn't.
Then I thought about how I was lying to them, and all of a sudden, the words "I am lying" appeared on the screen.

My family asked me what was wrong, and before I could think about it, the words "I am in a lot of pain" appeared on the screen.

Then there was a long pause.

I didn't want to say it, but my family needed to know the truth, so I thought about how I was going to die and the words "I am dying" appeared on the screen.

My wife started crying and I could see my daughter out of the corner of my eye.
She was standing in the corner of the room, playing with a doll.
I thought about how I was going to miss her growing up and the words "I will never get to see you grow up" appeared on the screen.

My wife asked me if there was anything she could do to save me, and I thought about how there was no way she could save me and the words "There is nothing you can do" appeared on the screen.

My wife started crying harder and I could see my daughter starting to cry.
I thought about how I would never get to see her again and the words "I will never see you again" appeared on the screen.

Then there was another long pause.

My daughter ran over to me and put a doll in my hand.
I smiled at her and the words "I love you" appeared on the screen.

Then I thought about my wife, and the words "I love you too" appeared on the screen.

I could feel my heart beating faster.

I could feel my blood rushing through my body.

I could feel my lungs expanding and contracting.

I could feel my body moving.

I could feel myself being pulled out of the hospital bed.

I could feel myself being pulled out of the hospital.

I could feel myself being pulled out of the room.

I could feel myself being pulled out of my body.

I could feel myself being pulled out of my mind.

I could feel myself being pulled out of existence.

Then I was gone.

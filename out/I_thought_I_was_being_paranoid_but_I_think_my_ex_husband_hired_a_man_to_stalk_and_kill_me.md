I scramble through my purse feeling frantically for any sign of my key on my fingertips, my heart in my throat. A distant roar of thunder growls in the night sky, and I can smell the rain approaching quickly. The sky illuminates suddenly, as a lightning bolt electrifies the air and gives me just enough time to spot the key poking out of the inside pocket of my purse. I can’t breathe, but I have to stay as calm as possible. I grip the key tightly between my fingers and place it into the doorknob - my hand is shaking so I steady the key with two hands. *Shit. This stupid key.* I use my other hand to jiggle the knob and finally feel a give as the key begins to twist until it unlocks. Taking one final urgent scan through my dark surroundings - the bushes beneath my neighbors front windows, the shadows casted below the light pole near the road, the area of the carport with the door leading to the storage room. My pulse is running so fast I can feel its throb rhythmically in both of my temples.

I step inside the front door of the house, reaching around the door frame towards the wall to flip on the overhead light before dead bolting and latching the chain on the door behind me. I’m not done though. I grab a knife from the kitchen drawer and walk swiftly through the house - first room, first closet, first bathroom, behind the shower curtain, laundry room closet, the master bedroom and bathroom to my left at the end of the narrow hallway, behind the clothes hanging in the master closet, the small office across the hallway. *All clear.*

I shut myself inside the master bedroom and place the wooden chair sitting in the corner of the room under the doorknob. The lump inside my throat can’t maintain itself for any longer. Tears start trickling out of the corners of my eyes, then spill onto my cheeks. I gasp for air in between audible sobs, feeling like an idiot. *Why am I so paranoid? This is not rational. No one has been following you. Get it together*, I think so myself. But I know my intuition has a good score board. It has since I was a child. A blessing and a curse. But I choose to listen to my inner dialogue this time, thinking if a friend were in my position, I would reassure them that they are safe. Not many people are stalked and murdered. Especially in Mississippi. Sure, it happens. But the chances are in my favor. I inhale, exhale, and use the sleeves of my sweater to wipe my cheeks dry.

Feeling much more calm with the doors locked, the house searched, and the barricaded door holding me prisoner in this room, I stand up and walk slowly towards the wooden dresser. A large antique piece with gaudy, brass handles. Swirls carved into the edges. Topped with a large antebellum-like mirror, with rounded edges that remind me of a castle in a way. I look up at myself - eyes swollen, sweat still visible on my forehead (although it is cold outside), flushed cheeks, bloodshot and damp eyes. My red hair somewhat matted in the ponytail and the pieces around my face were still sticking to my skin from the remaining sweat. I pull the sweater I am wearing over my head and toss it onto the king-sized bed behind me. As much relief as I get from the air conditioning inside the house touching my skin, allowing me to breathe a little more, I realize the blinds of the windows are open. I rush to the windows and twist until they hide the abyss of the black night haunting me outside. The decor in the room is not my taste, but it is a nice home objectively. A little stiff - bland colors, not many knick knacks topping the dressers, nothing hanging on the walls, no rug. I ache to go back home, but home isn’t safe anymore.

I walk to the sink and pull out my face cleanser, ready to wash the makeup and sweat from my skin. I feel disgusting from the inside as well as the outside. The splash of cold water from the sink faucet gives me instant relief. The unusual color choice of the green towel hangs from the silver ring on the wall next to me, and I pull it off and wipe my face. As I stare once more into the mirror back at myself, I notice the closet door still standing open from my frantic search through the house. When the light flicks on, I stare at all the clothes and shoes filling the racks and shelves. More like the shoes on the floor. Not the most organized closet, but better than mine at home - or not my home anymore, I remind myself.

The shoes are not beside each other in pairs, but are piled here and there. Taking it upon myself to at least move them from the middle of the floor and push them out of the way to the edges of the walls beneath the hanging clothes, I notice a silver latch on the floor. A safe, maybe? Some sort of storage area? Unable to shake my curiosity, I pull on the handle, and the floor opens. I quickly and paranoidly take a hands and knees position and look down. *An attic to the rental unit below the house? But, I didn’t think the rental unit could access this home.* It isn’t occupied anyway. It has been locked up and unused for years. But that didn’t mean it didn’t still give me a pit in my stomach.

I slam the door close and pull the small chest of what I assume to be family pictures from the corner on top of it. *There. Peace of mind.* My favorite silk pajamas peek out from my unzipped bag sitting on the bed, and I dress myself feeling much more relaxed. Remembering that I packed a small pistol (knowing the paranoia that fills my brain daily), I thank myself and find it in the zipper pouch. I know nothing about guns, but from what I was told, it is loaded and ready to shoot. How hard could it be to aim and pull a trigger. I place it on the nightstand next to the bed. Just for even more peace of mind. I notice a tiny glow of light coming between the cracks in the blinds, and I pull them apart to glance out the window. The neighbors house was far enough away that the yard had some privacy, but the kitchen light could still be seen from a distance - especially at night through the darkness. Nice neighbors. An older couple. Friendly pair. Big church people.

I glance out towards their house, but the kitchen light is off. *Weird. Maybe a car’s headlights?* But the light was still coming from somewhere. My silver Malibu sits parked in the carport, visible from where I stand. I study it, making sure no figures and unexplainable shadows surround it. Something is glaring back at me from the silver hood. *Oh my, GOD. The rental unit downstairs. But no one has lived there in years.* I rush back to the closet and scoot the chest away from the top of the attic door latch. As quietly as possible, I pull at the silver latch and crack the door slightly to see if light was glowing through the cracks.  *No. No. No.* I could hear someone moving beneath the floor in the attic and a sliver of light peeked up through the boards. *What the hell. Had the noises I had been hearing coming from the unit this whole time?*

My fingers dial the phone number staring back at me from a sticky note on the bathroom mirror. No answer. They dial faster this time. When I hear the voice on the other end of the phone reassure me that no one is supposed to be in that rental unit, I drop the phone. *Who is down there?* I rush across the room for my gun, and I hear what sounds like footsteps ascending stairs below me. *What should I do? What the hell do I do?* My fingers clutch the small pistol, and I raise my arms to aim it towards the closet and bathroom. The ph0ne rings. The footsteps stop. Answering the phone would let them know I was here, ready for them to attack. I let it ring, and when the ringing stops, the footsteps continue to ascend - faster this time. My instinct to run doesn’t outweigh the possibility that I wouldn't be fast enough, especially with all the barricades and locked doors. So I sit. And I wait.

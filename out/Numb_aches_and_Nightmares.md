"Well, everything appears to be working as normal" My Doctor said reassuringly, although the feeling she had been trying to convey didn't strike any chords of comfort.

"You're sure? Because no matter what I take, Ibuprofen, ASA even Benadryl doesn't get rid of it. Its just pain and it only happens at 9pm, its the strangest thing doc" 

"Well we'll wait another month, if it continues or gets worse come back to me"

Great, another two hours wasted on nothing. I don't even know why I keep coming back here I get the same response every time "Come back in a month" or "I'm sure its nothing" are doctors even allowed to say that? Fuck who knows, I didn't go to med school who am I to say. Well I suppose I should probably explain what the fuck is going on hm? perhaps one of you guys will know what the hell is happening to me.

Hello, I'm Cameron, Cameron Van Heimlich. I'm 26 and I make pizzas for a living, I know, I sound like a real go-getter. Four months ago I happened to be working the closing shift and was the only one on staff (Small town problems ya know?) when a man walked in. He had looked to be in his mid 40's, clean shaven face, slicked back hair, kind of looked like a mix between Paul Rudd and Johnny Depp just slightly less attractive. He walked up to the cash register and I did my best "Hi! Welcome to The Dough Show! How can I satisfy your pizza needs?" In probably my best customer service voice I could muster in my sleep deprived state.

He made his order which I can not remember for the life of me, however I recall his voice being deep, a little raspy, but soothing; I would've asked him to read me a bedtime story or something, had that not broken every social rule known to man. I made his order and slid him his pizzas, told him "Have a wonderful night!" and as he turned to walk out of the store something fell from his pocket. He hadn't noticed so I dashed around the counter quickly saying "Excuse me sir? you dropped thi-" As I bent to pick it up however, the moment my eyes fell upon this odd wooden object I couldn't help but feel, numb? It was so strange, as if all the nerves in my body fired at once. The object itself wasn't strange, a wooden cross necklace, but when I picked it up and spun it around it wasn't anything I had seen before.

Usually you'd find Jesus on a cross necklace, but not this one no. this one had an odd elongated creature screaming staring at the sky carved into it, truthfully it was unnerving to look at. He walked over at took it out of my hand and chuckled "Sorry, must've slipped out, thank you" I remember his eyes, cold, pained, and I swear he didn't blink once. His smile was even more unsettling, as if he knew something I didn't, and just like that he left. I never saw him after that, just that once. It should've been forgettable but the events that would occur after the encounter make it stick in my head like a reoccurring nightmare. You see almost every night after said encounter with the man, at 9pm without fail, that Numb pain shoots through my body and the feeling can last up too 3 hours. Should I be asleep at 9pm well, lets say that I thought the Numbness hurt.

Should I be in a state of unconsciousness before 9pm, These... Dreams occur, always the same never different. I'm always in a Library, surrounded by ten thousand foot tall bookshelves that seem to have no end, filled with books. There is a single light illuminating a chair, an old rocking chair made of some dark mahogany, if I stay standing, a feeling of intense dread washes over me. I begin to panic, scream, yet to no avail and then, poof I'm awake. 

If I sit in the chair (Which I had only done once, maybe two nights ago) Then the true horror really begins. I sat down in the chair, and fell asleep again, in my dream. I know It doesn't make sense to me either. In this dream of a dream I stand upon never ending plains, the sun and moon parallel to each other in the sky, the creature (the one that had been on that mans cross) stands before me. With maybe 10 feet of space between us, and speaks. 

In a million voices, but also not making a sound, it speaks a single sentence.

"Your path has ended"

Too which I had awoken in a very cold sweat

Which brought me to go see my Doctor, when I had explained what I had been feeling (leaving out the dream shit because, lets be honest whos actually going to believe that) I was told "Come back next month!"

But today things are worse, much worse. I see its face in the mirror, around every corner, in the reflection of the pizza ovens at work. And every conversation I overhear has that phrase "Your path has ended"

I grow very tired, I feel alone, and I am in pain... excruciating pain. Sleep seems like a death sentence and any action I could take might bring me to a six foot deep hole, I'm going to stay up tonight, I'll Update in the morning. Please if anyone knows how to help let me know.

Signed-

Cameron Van Heimlich

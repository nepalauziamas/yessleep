 

Ever since I was a child, I loved horror movies, I remember staying up late nearly every night with my mom watching movies like Poltergeist or The Thing. My mom used to hide under a pillow anytime something scary happened, she was more scared than I was. As a child I was not afraid of any thing, I would often go to the supposedly haunted places at night on my own, just for the trill. I think I was able to do this because I never really believed in the paranormal, or religion for that matter. Growing up I went to a catholic school, and I had a big interest in religion, maybe a bit too much for my teachers. When the priest would come to our class, I always had a list of questions for him, which got me into a lot of trouble. I was a very logical and inquisitive child, if something did not make since to me, I'd question it. My teachers never liked it when I did that, I think they thought I was making fun of the priest, because he never knew how to answer me, But I was just curious and didn’t understand why I was getting punished. 

In my teens I realized religion didn’t make since to me anymore, I guess I poked too many holes in it with my questions and I realized I was an atheist, but that never affected my love of horror. I am pushing 40 now and have kids, so I don’t get to watch as many horror movies as I used to. Lately I decided to read more since watching horror movies had become a bit too much of a challenge. I had known for a long time that Steven King got inspiration when he found one of Lovecraft's collections in his attic when he was a child. so, I thought I’d start there. At first, I found it hard to get into it, I think it was just his style of writing, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it. I found it amazing how much his writing got inside my head, I liked his over description style, it almost seemed believable at times. By the time I finished my first story, I couldn’t wait to start the next one, I could see how he inspired so many people.  

I usually read in the evenings, it helped me get tired before bed. I really began to love reading, it opened up a whole new world for me, until I started to have nightmares. The thing is I actually like nightmares, they were like my own personal horror movies, but these were different. No two dreams were alike, but they always had the exact same story; some dark unseen force was chasing me, and when I would eventually confront it, I'd find out, it was not evil at all, and it just wanted to help me. The message I got from it was, don’t be afraid, I might look scary, but I am your friend, just give in.  

I never knew what it meant until one night I had a dream, that I was staying in this old school with three others and every night some unseen force would come for one of us. The next day, whoever it was, would come back with some sort of power, I never actually seen their powers, I was always too afraid to go with them, even in the days. Eventually I was the only one left, I felt so alone, they kept asking me to except the powers when he comes, but they had never actually pushed me into it when I said no, but I still felt left out. When I went to bed that last night, in that dream, it came for me, it felt so real, it started off with a cold breeze blowing in my face and feeling of pure terror, then an inner voice saying don’t fight it. I could feel it hovering over me, Then I woke. I was so freaked out, I had to get up and walk around the room to clear my head before going back to sleep. I’m not sure why it got to me more than the rest of the dreams, I think it was the fact that everything seemed so real.  

That’s when things started to get fucked up, I had no sooner put my head back down on that pillow when I felt that breeze on my face again, at first, I thought it was just a draft but there were no windows open. I was terrified, I couldn’t believe what was happening, I thought I was dreaming and pinched myself, but I was awake. I jumped out of bed, checked every door and window, everything was locked, and when I looked out, it was flat calm outside. I didn’t know what to do so I just went back to bed, but as soon as my head hit the pillow, it happened again. The wind made my skin ice cold instantly, I was freaked out, I thought how could this be happening, when I sat up it was gone. This went on for about a half hour, I got so scared I called my wife. I never told her what happened, how could I she would think I was losing it. When she asked me why I woke her, I froze and just smiled, she thought I was messing with her, which pissed her off and she started giving me a lecture, but I didn’t mind I was just happy she was awake, and I had someone to talk to.  

The next day I decided to give Lovecraft or any other kind of horror a miss for a while, so before bed I watched a sitcom. I started to feel sick halfway through the first episode and by the end of the second I couldn’t stand up; my legs were like jelly. My wife helped me upstairs, and we went to bed. As the night went on, I started sweating and bruises started showing up on my legs and arms, then I had an uncontrollable urge to do what. I didn’t know. When I started to hallucinate, shadowy creatures crawl up the walls, I knew it was time to ring an ambulance. I thought I was dying; my wife prayed the whole way to the hospital. They tested me for everything and anything over the next two days but could not find out what was causing my symptoms. 

By the end of the second day I could barely move, my wife was so good to me she stayed with me the whole time and helped me do everything. She even offered to read to me. I knew she hated all things horror, but I wanted to hear a Lovecraft story one more time, I was sure I wouldn’t be there the next morning. I picked Dagon. It was the first story I read and my favorite, within seconds of her starting to read to me, I started to feel a little bit better, I didn’t say anything straight away, I waited until she finished, by then I felt completely normal. Even the bruises were starting to go away. 

 The Doctors were baffled, they wanted me to stay there for a few more days, but I left the next morning. Being the skeptic that I am I never actually thought it was the Lovecraft stories that cured me, until that night after I got out of hospital. I had lost out on a lot of sleep since becoming ill so, I went to bed early to catch up. Within an hour I woke in terrible pain, it seemed to come from every part of my body, it was worse than the last time, I leaned out over the side of the bed and vomited. That empty feeling and that uncontrollable urge came back, it was like I had not eaten or drank anything in days, but I was not hungry or thirsty. Then it crossed my mind what if it was Lovecraft's stories, I was sure I was being stupid, but I had nothing to lose, so I got out my phone and started reading, instantly I felt back to normal, since then I never missed a night. I can’t explain it, the logical part of me says the only thing it could be is some sort of psychological thing, but for the first time in my life I believed there is more to it. 

The problem is, I'm starting to hear voices now and it is getting worse every time I read, it always says the same thing, “Let it in.” Every night I can feel something in my room with me, waiting, it knows it's only a matter of time before I give in. I don’t know what will happen when I do, maybe it will give me some sort of gift, all I do know is, I will find out soon enough.

Part 2.

'Mum!!' I yelped, holding my arm outstretched.

She looked over to me, barely noticing the advancing policemen.

Brian looked shocked and confused at my outburst, like he was ready to run, but didn't know why?

'Get back!' I screeched as one of the officer's glowing yellow eyes met mine, his foaming black toothed grin gave me a feeling of being stabbed in the stomach.

The room began to distort and twist, I could have sworn I was spinning, or the rest of the world was! The sun had more or less disappeared and darkness began to creep in all around me.

I hunched over in pain as I watched the other officer slowly extend his hand, my Mum gazed at him, seemingly in a trance like state.

I struggled to force any more words from my mouth.

My Mum took his hand and slowly stood up, eyes locked with the officer.

'Thank you for your time Mrs.Cochrane' he said.

In a flash I found myself on the ground wretching, feeling vulnerable and weak.

I looked up, my Mum was shaking hands with the policemen.

'Thank you so much for coming, if I hear anything I'll phone straight away' she said.

'Danny! You okay?' I looked round and saw Brian kneeling on the other side of me looking concerned.

My Mum and the police officers noticed and dashed to pick me up.

My Mum was panicking and the two officers helped me to my feet.

'You alright there son?' The older one asked.

My head was still spinning.

'Did I just imagine that?' I thought to myself.

'I-I... I'm fine, I'm okay, I just felt dizzy and a bit sick'. I replied.

The younger guy helped me to the couch, I was wary of him touching me after that smile I saw earlier but he seemed normal, he seemed absolutely fine.

'Thanks... honestly I'm okay!' I reassured them while trying to motion to my Mum to get them out of the house.

'Okay, as long as you're feeling better'. The younger officer said, flashing a wide grin of perfect white teeth, in stark contrast to earlier... could I be sure I saw that?

Maybe I did imagine it.

I watched from the window as the 2 officers hastily left and got into their car.

As they pulled away, the younger officer side glanced at me and winked, his eye changing from white to yellow for a split second before they were out of view.

I stood with my mouth hanging open.

Brian put a finger under my chin and closed my mouth for me.

'What's wrong Danny?'. Brian looked worried.

'That guy, the police... guy, He was... different'.

'Different, how?'. Brian asked.

I turned and looked at him, shaking my head.

'Like.... bell tower different... his eyes and... face, something wasn't right!'.

I began feeling the stabbing pain in my stomach again.

'Maybe you just imagined it, everything seemed fine to me... except you almost dying', he sniggered.

'I don't know man... maybe, I feel sick, I need to lie down a minute then we're going to look for my Dad!'. 

Brian quickly realised it wasn't a time for joking around. 

He took on a more serious demeanour, 'Head upstairs and lie down, I'll get you in 15 minutes'.  He patted my back as I walked away.

Lying staring at my ceiling, I couldn't help but question my own sanity, nothing had ever happened *outside* of the bell tower before.

Then again, Shawn and the others had been showing up outside my house.

Maybe whatever was in there had managed to get out, somehow.

My eyes felt heavy, the bell tower plagued my mind, my senses.

I felt myself beginning to doze off, the bells rang off in the distance and my body felt heavy, I was slipping away into sleep.

I found myself standing within the perimeter of the fence, Shawn was kicking the door to the bell tower.

It splintered and cracked, eventually bursting open as I looked on, feeling the most unreal déjà vu.

'Simple as that' he chuckled as he turned to me with his face covered in black pulsing veins.

The door, the latch and most of the wood holding it in place had completely ripped off.

Shawn laughed like a maniac as his eyes pulled me closer towards him.

I almost fell out of my bed as Brian burst in the room, 'Feeling any better?' He asked.

My head throbbed as his words rattled the inside of my brain. 

'Danny, you look like shit!' He said as he put his hand on my shoulder.

'I'm fine!' I slapped his hand away.

Cold sweat poured down my face.

'Let's just get out of here and find my Dad, I'm fine!'.

Brian didn't seem convinced, however, 5 minutes later we were roaming the streets on bikes, I had my Dad's bike and Brian had my old bike I hadn't used for about 5 years.

It was insanely small, it was small for me when I was 14, he actually looked hilarious.

We took turns almost at random, keeping our general direction mostly northbound, mainly  because I had a bad feeling he might have ended up at the bell tower.

I could feel eyes on me, I kept looking all around me, everyone appeared to be staring at me, looking away when I would catch them.

I don't know if I was becoming paranoid or if this was really happening.

I shook my head and slapped my face, focusing on the road ahead as best I could.

Brian was slowing us way down, almost kneeing himself in the face with every pedal.

We cycled for hours, down countless streets.

No sign of my Dad or his car anywhere.

We had come to the Northern part of Fort William, just before you leave the town to get to Ben Nevis. 

There's not much around, a few streets we tried and some wooded areas.

There's a smallish retail park just before you exit the town, there's a couple of supermarkets there, so we stopped st the M&S Foodhall to pick up something to eat and some water to take with us.

We had a few more hours until night time so we needed some supplies.

I chained the bikes together and we caught our breath before heading inside.

'What a tune man!' Brian blurted out as we entered.

Somebody's watching me by Rockwell played throughout the supermarket's PA system, a bit too loud in my opinion.

'Very apt for us!' I laughed as I turned to Brian who was grabbing a trolley.

'We don't need a trolley, we're not getting much!'

Brian looked at me, 'I don't care, I'm not carrying stuff'.

The supermarket was pretty empty which I always prefer, I hate standing in queues.

Before I knew it, Brian had whizzed away towards the deli aisle for some sandwiches, I headed straight for the 'snacks' aisle which was apparently at the other end of the shop.

I was walking fast so I couldn't be dead sure.

Passing the 'kitchenware' aisle, for a split-second, I could swear I saw Shawn in my periphery, sliding a large blade from a knife block, staring right at me.

I stopped and looked back.

There was just some old guy looking at the label of a frying pan.

Yes, I felt relieved but that initial feeling of dread didn't fully go away.

I found myself standing staring at the crisps, quietly singing along to the song and not being able to decide what I wanted to eat.

Just as the iconic chorus sung by Michael Jackson kicked in, the lights above me flickered.

I looked up.

The music began to drown out and fade.

Like I was rapidly being pulled into a tunnel.

I heard something else.

Humming.

Someone behind me was humming 'With a Little Help From my Friends' by The Beatles.

The hair on my neck stood up.

I began feeling faint as my vision blurred.

'Danny! Are you sure this is the right one?'

I froze in fear as I recognised Liam's voice.

My legs began to give way.

I turned to see Liam standing holding a live magpie in his hands.

His face was swollen and red, it looked like multiple chunks of flesh had been ripped off.

His dead eyes just stared me down as I slowly got lower.

Out of nowhere a large kitchen knife was plunged into the bird, all the way through and right through Liam's hand.

Shawn was standing laughing wildly, 'well Danny boy!? Is it?'.

Liam's dead gaze never faltered.

I felt a stabbing pain in my gut.

I dropped to the ground covering my eyes and screaming for help.

A hand on my shoulder startled me and I moved away, down the aisle.

'Danny, what's wrong man? What's going on?'.

I opened my eyes and saw Brian standing in front of me looking worried.

The music blared through the PA, the supermarket seemed calm.

Brian helped me up, 'Danny, tell me what's going on man, this has happened twice today!'.

I barged his shoulder as I shoved past him without saying a word, I just needed to get outside for some air.

Brian was right behind me and grabbed me to turn me around.

'Danny, whatever's happening you need to tell me and you need to tell me now!'.

I sighed and looked at the ground.

'I saw Liam and Shawn in there, earlier today one of the policemen looked like that demon thing and then I see Liam and Shawn in M&S!?, I don't know what's going on Brian, but this thing seems to be stalking me, people are going missing and nobody is saying anything about it, I don't know what's going on, I wish I did but I don't!'

Brian just glared at me with a look of guilt on his face.

'I'm sorry man, it just feel like this is never gonnae end, it feels like it's spreading'.

'I know what you mean' Brian said, 'we need to find out if there's a way we can put a stop to this for good, find out about the history of the tower and speak to anyone who has worked there for any reason, maintaining the land, restoration work, anything, anything at all, we track then down, anyone who has any kind of history with the bell tower, and find out as much as we can about it, you never know Danny, we might just find exactly what we're looking for!'.

I nodded, Brian's little motivational speech was a valiant effort, we really do need to cling on to hope, but we also need to find my Dad and make sure we avoid being taken ourselves.

'I think I know where to start!' I said proudly as I looked at Brian.

'The bell tower fence has signs on it telling you not to go in or climb the fence, they're from a security company, there's always security companies looking after old buildings like that, I'm thinking we try them!' I smiled awaiting Brian's reaction to my brainwave.

He never smiled back.

'So... you mean we're going back there?' He said, his voice shaking.

'No Brian, I mean yes but we aren't going in, we're just going to get a name or number of the company in charge of the grounds'.

Brian looked down at his feet.

'I don't want to go Danny, please don't make me go!' 

'Brian, we need to! at least come to the woods with me and I'll go in myself, I swear we aren't going any further than the fence'.

Brian thought for a few moments.

'To the woods, I'm not going any further Danny! I'm sorry'.

'To the woods! I'll be 5 minutes max!'

I hopped on my bike and led the way, the road was quiet and we seemed to get there in no time at all.

'Right, I'll go in, I'm walking up to the fence and turning back, I'll be no more than 10 minutes'. I told Brian.

'I thought you said 5!?' 

'I did but it's probably about 5 minutes each way, I'll run, I'll be quick I promise!'.

'Okay!' He seemed annoyed, but we never had time to hang around arguing.

I turned and ran through the woods.

The bell tower quickly came into view, but that wasn't all...

My Dad's car sat just off to the side, the body was badly dented, and the windows were all smashed.

I stopped for a moment and stared, there was nobody inside.

Proceeding with extreme caution I slowly made my way over to his car and looked inside.

The seats were torn to shreds, I couldn't see a path into this area where a car would be able to get through, this made absolutely no sense.

My phone buzzed.

It was Brian.

'Hurry up man, something doesn't feel right out here' he said.

'I... I'm just coming'.

Brian hung up without saying anything else.

I opened my camera and took 2 pictures of my Dad's car.

A shrill scream came from the bell tower.

I walked back round to the front of the fence and looked from the top to the bottom.

I saw the door, gently banging off the frame as it moved freely in the wind, a large section of it was completely gone... nothing was holding it shut.

It looked exactly as it did in my dream, no lock, no latch.

Maybe that was it...

I turned and bolted back through the woods, stopping myself after about 30 seconds.

'The security company!' I said to myself.

I quickly sprinted back and pulled my phone out to  take a picture of the sign attached to the fence.

When I got there, Shawn, Ash and Dennis were standing in the doorway looking at me.

I slowed almost to a halt.

They just stared as I crept up to the fence and held out my phone to take the photo.

I made sure to try and get them in to show Brian when I got back.

Shawn waved me over, 'Danny boy! Just come with us man, you're only delaying the inevitable!'

They all laughed.

I turned and ran back through the woods.

I could see Brian waiting anxiously at the road side, looking all around him.

When I came out from the trees, Brian almost jumped out of his skin.

'Fucking shat myself there!! Where were you? You said 10 minutes, that was like...' he pulled out his phone, '13 minutes'.

'I went as fast as I could, something's definitely going on man'.

'You're telling me? All I've had is shadows in the trees telling me to follow them'.

'Well, that's the least of our worries right now, my Dad's car is up at the bell tower, and I saw Shawn, Ash and Dennis up there' I explained picking my bike up.

'Shit, what were they doing? And how the hell did your Dad's car get there? Surely that's impossible!'.

'Apparently not... they weren't doing much just standing there trying to get me to go in, I got a picture of them, and the car'.

'Did you get the security sign?'.

'Yep, got that too'. 

I pulled my phone out to show Brian the pictures.

My Dad's car was first.

'That's insane man, I can't even imagine how that's possible'. Brian said, sounding shocked as ever.

'Me neither, look at this one', I got the next picture of the security sign up.

'Where are they?' Brian asked, scrutinizing the photo.

'Wh... what? They were there in the doorway' I zoomed in, 'I swear man, they were there'.

I looked dumbfounded at my phone. 

I almost had a heart attack when it rang in my hand.

'My Mum' I said to Brian, rolling my eyes as I turned to walk away.

'Hello?' I answered.

'Hi Son, it's Mum. Just to let you know that you can come home now, that's your Dad back'.

It was a cold winter day, circa about 2 years ago. I was in an AirBNB with several other family members, in a cabin with ski lifts and whatnot.

After we did a bit of skiing, I went back to my room and went onto my phone, as usual. I was going to text my grandma, who had opted to not come along with us, to see how she was doing. However, the minute I opened the SMS app, I saw something weird. It was a message from an unrecognizable number.

- ‚Äúhello friend üòä‚Äù

I was confused for a while. Who is this texting me? Is this a forgotten friend I used to have? That mystery would have to wait, though. When we got to the airport to leave, a man suddenly dropped as if they were dead onto the hard carpeted floor. A rush of paramedics soon rushed into the room, taking the paralyzed man with them.

I got another message from the same number.

-‚Äúdo you like planes? ‚úàÔ∏è‚Äù

The coincidence was frightening, almost as if I could connect the two points together. Maybe someone was stalking me and had just murdered and innocent man? How was I to know?

Anyways, we boarded the airplane, we landed, and I hopped into my car.

It was an older Lexus, I remember it being beige in color on the inside. I had got it a couple years earlier.

As I am driving home on the turnpike, the same number pops up, calling me in FaceTime. Obviously, I declined the call.

The number texted me back, telling me to call them. It felt like an eerie suspense like in  those horror movies was building up on the highway. 

I driver over to my exit and pulled up to my home‚Äôs driveway; it was a 3-story apartment building with 18 apartments per story. I swung around my keys, fumbling with the lock and trying to get the key in the hole correctly when I finally opened the door and rushed to my bed.

When I woke up, it was already noon into the next day. I had several messages from the number which had been annoying me for so long. One of which was:

-‚Äúknock knock your supposed to say whos there‚Äù

Just as I finished reading the sentence, there was a loud thud on my door.
I got scared and looked out the peephole. All I could get was a silhouette, but I knew someone or something was there, trying to enter my doorway. I scurried away as it knocked one this time breaching a small hole into the doorhandle. I practically ran under my bed as the thing ripped open what used to be my door.

I quietly entered the numbers; 9-1-1. When I called, I whispered to them everything in a voice that could crack even if dropped one centimeter. 

The police finally came, but there was no evidence of the thing that broke into my apartment. 

They only found a small track that didn‚Äôt even seem of this Earth.

Never text someone you don‚Äôt know.

Or else.

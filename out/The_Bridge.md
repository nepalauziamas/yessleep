 

**The Bridge**

The bridge didn’t used to be there. Not until a few days ago. It is an old, covered bridge made of wood. No one knows where it came from or how it got here, but we all agree that there is a bridge here now. 

There were no physical barriers between us and the bridge. Nothing to stop people from going in it. There was just something…off. Something about it didn’t feel right. It was impossibly long. The area of lake it covered, from the outside, was clearly no more than 35 feet. If you looked into the bridge, the light was so small at the other end, it must have been at least a mile long. 

It didn’t creak or sway, not that we could see anyways. It was just there. Big, dark, rotting but not falling apart. 

Someone joked about taking a scooter down it, but no one ever stepped up to the challenge. A few kids would scream and claim they saw the shadow of something moving around in there, but could never really give more information than that. I think most made it up, but there were a few that had looks of true terror in their eyes. Most of the kids looking in would just have a terrified look on their face, but wouldn’t say anything about what they might have seen. Their faces told me that whatever it was, I didn’t want to see it myself. Only, I think I did. 

I am pretty sure I saw something walk across the light, blocking it completely for several seconds. I rubbed my eyes, and it was still there! I started to say something, but I knew someone else had to have seen it because it was so huge! No one was reacting after it moved from the light of the tunnel. No one saw it! How could no one have seen it? I decided I would look like a looney toons if I said anything, so I just swallowed my shock, and kept looking down the too long bridge. 

The first kid disappeared 9 days later.

**.**

The bridge had been there for 2 weeks now. 14 days. The boy, little Michael Carson, his parents live up near the church on Small Road. Very nice family with very polite boys. Michael was the baby of the family. He was small for his age, but had a personality that was larger than life. Boy was a real hoot!  

Michael had been telling me for a while that he kept hearing a scratching when he looked down the bridge. Sometimes he would even hear it in his bed at night. There were no bears anywhere near our town, so I just assured him it was all in his head. I told him it was probably just a deer or something, because they make super weird sounds sometimes. 

“Yeah, maybe”, he would say as he slumped his shoulders down., “but I heard it scratching”. 

I told him it was not a big deal, and we can go down there and check the bridge out right now. Michael looked terrified, but also curious. I was friends with his older brother for a while, but kinda took the kid under my wing after Jordan and I had a falling out. Like I said, he’s a good kid. We got to the bridge in about an hour, and rested on a nearby broken boulder to catch our breath. There was a group of kids already here, to be honest, the bridge was never alone anymore. We walked up to the boys and asked what they were doing.

“We’re gonna touch the bridge. Wanna come? Unless you are too girly girl to do it” sneered a bucktoothed kid with black hair and oversized glasses. I knew him as Kevin. Everyone hates Kevin, but he is good to have around to laugh about. 

“No, let’s do it!” I replied, knowing that I was forever in danger of acting like the girl I am. I pulled my fists up, pumped them a little, then started heading towards the bridge. Knowing he had a face to save, Kevin got his gang to catch up to me. Michael trailed behind them all. 

I stopped a few feet away from the bridge opening. I took a deep breath. It smelled in there. It smelled like an animal's den. It was dark, a different kind of dark, like a basement. There was no sun shining through the wooden slats. Just complete darkness until the small circle of light at the end. That was when I heard the scratching. 

Michael heard it too and immediately ran through the wall of boys to be next to me. “That is the scratching. Did you hear it, Jes?” His eyes were so big and teary. Yes, I told him. “That’s how it sounded last week when I was here. Now, it's a lot louder.” I gulped as I tried to figure out how to word my question so as not to confuse an 8 year old. “Why did you get this close to it” I asked.

“Jordan made me. He told me I had to touch it, and to not be a baby anymore, so I had to.” Michael smashed his face into his dirty hands. He seemed equally ashamed and scared of what he said. 

I decided that this was enough, and that we are going home. I grabbed Michaels hand, and drug him to the side of the boys, “We are leaving. He is scared and he needs to go home”. I didn’t even wait to hear the insults I knew were coming. I was scared myself, I heard the scratching. We walked the hour trek back to Michaels house, and I watched him go inside, then wave at his window, our little tradition.

I smiled as I walked home. It was a nice evening out, the cicadas were doing their yearly screamfest. Lightning bugs popping up here and there. Just a nice spring country night. It would be the last night the people of Friendship, Colorado had a good sleep. 

**.**

The lights flashing woke me up. It was 4 in the morning, still middle of the night, as I walked to my window to see what was going on. The police were doing a door to door search for something, and the cruisers lined the streets. I ran to my parents room to wake them up, only to hear them call for me from downstairs. I walked down to them and studied their faces. They were twisted into indecipherable expressions. I couldn’t tell if they were mad, sad, or scared. Maybe all three. I could hear a lot of talking on the officers radio, but couldn’t make it out. 

“Jes, did you see Michael today? What were you doing? What did he say? Why did you go to the bridge? He told classmates he heard scratching, did he tell you that? What is scratching? Where is he?”

All the questions hit me at once. I answered as best I could. I asked what was going on, and the officer knelt down and told me. He said Michael was gone. After I dropped him off, he grabbed a soda and went to his room. His parents thought he was already asleep because his light was off, so they just whispered goodnight to him and went to bed themselves. They woke up to screaming, and then absolute silence. As if nothing happened. They checked his room and it looked the same, only he wasn’t in bed. His blankets were piled to look like he was there, but now they don’t know if he ever was. They don’t even have a time frame they think he went missing. 

Every day after Michael disappeared, another kid went missing as well. It took 3 more boys,5 total including Jordan,  before I realized there was a pattern. Everyone missing was at the bridge that day with Kevin or had been at the bridge and touched it with Michael. Kevin was still around, so I thought who better to ask than him. After trying to track him down at his friend's house, I found him, alone, sitting in front of the bridge. He appeared to be studying it, lost in its expanse. 

“It’s not going to move, ya know”, I called out to Kevin. Finally, I got my little jab in first. Kevin hung his head as he mumbled, “Yea, I know. It might not move, but I think it’s alive or something. I don’t know. My ma said not to talk about it anymore”.

Stopping a few feet away, I squat down to Kevins face. “What do you mean ‘alive’, Kevin?”

“The bridge. I just, I just think it is alive in some way. I don’t know how to say it. I sound crazy, and you better not make fun of me.” Kevin shot up quickly, and startled me. I started to fall backwards, but was able to catch myself right before falling. My shoe was halfway on the first slat of the bridge. I heard a guttural moan and a loud scratching sound. I quickly threw my weight the other way, and landed at Kevin's feet. 

Kevin looked down at me, “ Did you hear it? The scratching? You will.” Kevin turned away from the bridge and took off running, towards home I guess. I followed a few seconds behind and ran until I was near the street. Kevin was long gone, kid could run faster than lightning. I was walking slow, trying to catch my breath when I heard it. The scratching. It sounded so close. I took off running as fast as I could, and didn’t stop until I was in my front door. As soon as I closed and locked it, I leaned my back against it, completely exhausted. I can still hear it, the scratching is on the other side of my front door!

**.**

I couldn’t sleep that night. The scratching seemed to be right outside my window, but I am on the second floor. Michael and Kevin both heard scratching too. I got up and walked over to my window, just to see if there is any animal movement on the street at night. I expected to see a random dog or two, maybe a fox or coyote. Instead, I saw Kevin walking past my house in the opposite direction of his. 

I opened my window and called out to him, but he didn’t seem to hear me. I slipped on my shoes and ran down to the front door to try to catch up to him. I swung the door open, and Kevin was standing right there. I jumped and eeked out a squeak of a scream. 

“What are you doing, Kevin? It is 2 in the morning. You need to go home”. Kevin's eyes never met mine, he seemed to focus on something just behind me.

“We need to go, Jes. It is time” Kevin spoke methodically and intentionally. His voice showed no emotion aside from urgency. I found myself unable, and unwilling, to protest and argue. I nodded in agreement, and joined him outside. We walked until we reached the bridge opening, and stared into the oblivion of darkness in front of us. Kevin slowly stepped onto the first slat and turned to face me.

“It’s time for me to go. I’ll see ya soon, Jes.” Kevin turned back towards the abyss, and in less than 3 steps he was completely shrouded in darkness.

I waited to see if he was going to come back, but then I heard scratching, like nails digging into wood for traction. I turned and started to sprint home, but thankfully did not hear the scratching follow. I snuck back into bed, and lay awake until the sun came up.

I already knew. The second I woke up, I knew what I had to do. As soon as my parents were asleep, I had to go back to the bridge. I could hear the other kids, the missing ones, calling for me. Begging me to come to them and see it is not so scary down there. Maybe this will finally make the scratching at my window stop. I have to do something.

The day crawled by and I was getting anxious about tonight. I didn’t have anything planned, I felt like it was all just instinctual. As the streetlights came on and porch lights turned off, I knew the world was falling to sleep. My parents had gone to bed about twenty minutes ago, so I knew by the time I got my shoes on they would both be sound asleep. I laced my High Top Chucks as tight as I could, and quietly creeped down the stairs. I inched the front door open and then closed it silently behind myself. I didn’t dare lock it, because that might wake someone up. Plus, I had to keep the door unlocked incase I needed to get inside real quick.

It was a cooler than usual spring night. The walk to the bridge was brisk and breezy. The gaping maw of the bridge seemed larger and more intimidating than usual. I stood on the toe line of the first slat and the ground before it. I had never actually stepped inside, unlike Jordan, Kevin, Michael and the rest of the guys. Michael had told me that they all stepped in there to prove they were not babies.

But, I never actually stepped fully in. Each time I barely touched the first slat, I heard the scratching and ran off. Maybe that was it! Maybe you had to step inside of it fully for it to take you. There was no light at the other end of the bridge at night. No way to see if something could be moving in there. I was suddenly faced with the thought that I might not be going home tonight. I might be the next missing kid. 

No, I said to myself. That is not an option. I don’t know what is going on here, but no hundred year old termite bridge is going to do anything to me. I looked down into the black echo chamber before me. “ You can’t have me! I never stepped inside your stupid bridge! Now give me back my friends and go away!!”

A growling started to grow from deep in the tunnel. No, it was more than one growl. It was at least 10 different howls and growls. My instincts kicked in, and I took off for home. I made it in record time, and slammed the door shut behind me. No scratching. No growling. It was quiet. Well, it was quiet until my dad stormed down the stairs in his too tight tighty whities and a baseball bat. 

“I thought I heard a cat that was hurt, but apparently it was just having a good time”, I gave as my explanation for why I was outside at this hour. My dad recoiled at the thought of having any kind of birds and bees talk with his daughter, and rushed me back to bed. 

**📷**

I beat it. I think. I am not really sure what happened. The next day, it was gone. 

That wasn’t the weirdest thing about it though. No one remembered it was there! No one remembered the missing kids. It was like they just never existed. When I went to talk to Jordan and Michaels mom, she acted like she had never seen me before. Even their house looked different. There were no children's drawings hanging at the entry of the home. I could see no trace of any kids. There were 4 of them, including Michael. How do you not notice all of your children just not existing anymore?

After Mrs. Carson threatened to call the cops on me and have me locked up in a mental hospital, I decided that maybe I should keep my mouth shut. I was terrified of being in a looney bin, so for 20 years I kept my mouth shut. Sure, I surfed the internet constantly looking for any reports of a bridge appearing, but nothing ever came up in my searches. I spent at least an hour a day, combing the internet for any clue about what this bridge could be or mean. 20 years of never even getting a hint of a resolution. 

I guess that is another special thing about the bridge. It makes people forget. They forget they even had kids. They forget their brothers and sisters, mothers forget their sons, fathers forget their daughters. That had to be how it could keep going as long as it did in Friendship. It makes everyone forget, and then moves on to another town, I guess. It had to be that, because I know this was not the first time it appeared. I found a few old macrophage news strips about missing children. Once the number gets above 8, the reports stop and there is no more mention of it. I called a few families listed in the old articles, but they never had a clue what I was talking about. The bridge makes you forget. It makes everyone forget. 

Not me though. I survived its scratching call. I never fully stepped inside, so I guess that's why I survived. Why it couldn’t take me like it did the others. I remembered everything, which I think makes me even more scared. I remember every question and every fear, but I still am no closer to the answer. What is the bridge and what is it doing with the kids?

I feel more frantic now to know the truth than 20 years ago. My daughter, Lila,  is 7 and I  couldn’t imagine a world without her. She came home from school today and told me she heard some kids talking about a bridge. A bridge that didn’t used to be there. Some of the kids were even talking about how if you listen closely, you can hear scratching inside, and sometimes kids giggling. They were daring each other to run down and touch the slat that was just past where the light can’t reach. 

They’ve been on the bridge already!

Tonight I will do what I should have done 20 years ago. I am going to burn that damn thing down. I have been waiting for it to come back, waiting for this moment. I didn’t think I was ever going to be a mother, so I never prepared for it to come after me in this way. I hope I prepared enough for it.  Tonight, the secrets and lies, the missing kids and fears, will go up in flames. My daughter will be safe, and maybe find out what happened to the other kids. Tonight, the scratching will finally stop.

The bridge burned for 3 days before it was gone. There were no ashes or remnants of it left. I sat there, in a trance, and watched it the entire time. Others would come and go, but no one said anything about putting it out or calling for help. The scratching stopped on the second day, and in its void the children's voices took over. At first they were laughing. Then they started screaming and crying for help before eventually falling silent. I was unmoved by all their calls and cries. On the third day, right before it left, I swear I heard the kids' voices again. This time it was not a cry or scream. There was a feeling of peace, like everything was going to right itself and be ok.

I didn’t know what I had done, nor did I even think about the consequences. I didn’t destroy it. You can’t destroy energy, it just goes to something else. Somewhere else. Someone else. I thought my job was over, that I had finally destroyed it. I saved Lila. I just didn’t know. The bridge was gone. The fear should have been gone with it. I torched that damned bridge over a month ago, but I think it is still here. I can hear the scratching coming from Lilas room.

I’m currently writing this on the back of a bus… it’s raining… and I don’t know what’s going on… 

This was the year I was going to graduate. After a long summer I was excited to return to school and see all my friends. To my luck, and the bipolar weather in my state, my mom was not able to pick me up. Normally she picks me up right outside the front of the school and we go home, I don’t take the bus because we live in a remote, and mostly far location from the school. Because of the weather she simply was not able to pick me up today and I was going to have to ride home on the bus today.

Because of where I live the bus driver would have to drive his usual route to a certain community then layover to drop me off. I was pleased to see some of my friends on the bus as I enjoyed the ride. The rain continued and wouldn’t let up. We eventually arrived at the community and the bus driver had me come to the front to confirm directions. I helped the guy out and returned to the back of the bus, simply because I liked the feeling of privacy.

The bus sputted out it’s usual diesel noises as we drove away from the community. My watch read 5:34 PM. I decided to lay back and try taking a nap with my hood over my face. I dozed off then jolted up as the bus braked. I pop up and look around. The time now read 5:50. It seems we were on the road still, but pulled over? I recognized the swampy forest we were in. Only 30 minutes away from my house. I look up and notice the bus driver looking panicked.

“Excuse me sir… may I ask what’s wrong?”

The bus driver jolted his head at me. He spoke with a worried tone. “N~ nothing kid. We had a tire pop on us… this will be quick! I’m just going to seal it and keep us moving.”

He opens the door. I look out the window as rain still came down in sheets. The bus driver stepped out. I waited and waited. I look down at my watch as minutes pass. At the top of the hour I get concerned. The man had been out there in the rain for a while. I stay laying back and notice the rain getting harder. I stand up and peer outside the window. The man was still out there working hard. It seemed that the rain water was causing the delay. I looked into the forest as a dark fog loomed over the swamp grounds. 

My house is remote because of the swamp grounds that divide my county. Apparently the land on which my house resides on was very cheap as it was the only fertile land surrounded by the swampy mess. My past generations would farm on it, and take their goods down the road I’m on right now… the only road back into the main part of the county. Many were superstitious of the large swamp, my grandpa would laugh at the silly ghost stories, but they always intrigued me. I stood staring at the fog more as I turn to look back at the bus driver. He was gone? But he was- suddenly the entire bus shook. I could hear a man screaming from behind me. Out of fear I jumped back onto the seat of my bus. I could hear the screaming as it got farther and farther away.

I’m now laying here in fear… my hoodie covers me like a blanket and I’m not sure what I should do… should I check on the man? Should I call my mom? I don’t know what to do.

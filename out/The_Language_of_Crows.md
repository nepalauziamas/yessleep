When I was nine I lived with my dad in a rundown apartment complex near an old train yard.  Surrounding us were industrial buildings that made loud noises at all hours of the day and night.  This was the best we could get.  Dad apologized to me almost everyday.  It wasn’t his fault.  He was doing all he could to provide for us.  He risked so much for me.

I didn’t understand that at nine, of course.

He worked long days as a janitor so the train yard was my babysitter.  I wandered the old, abandoned tracks.  Sometimes I made up fairy tales or pretended I was a fairy.  But mostly, I talked to the crows.  The tracks were littered with them.  Dozens of black birds with bright eyes.  They hopped about like bunnies.

I was never afraid of them.  Despite their loud chatter and sharp beaks, I knew they would never hurt me.  I had been hurt a lot in my life.  Memories of pain were always floating just beyond my eyeline.  But by watching the crows, I could escape for a little while.

At first they stayed away.  Dad told me if you want an animal to like you, you have to let it come to you.  So I sat cross legged near the tracks.  I let my arms rest on my knees.  My breath was soft and unafraid.

“Hello, my name is Anne,” I said quietly.  I was addressing all the birds, but one in particular caught my eye.  He was slightly smaller than the others and stared straight at me.  I wasn’t sure what to tell the birds so I began listing things.  “I am nine years old.  I like cake but not icing.  My dad calls me Annielou.  Some of the girls at school call me ‘man’ because I wear a lot of boy clothes and it rhymes with my real name.  I don’t like school.  But I like you all.”

The small crow hopped closer.  He cocked his head and cawed at me.  I smiled.  “Nice to meet you, too.”

I could feel him inspecting me.  Looking back now, I wonder if he could see the trauma I carried.  Birds are smarter than we give them credit for.  Perhaps he was studying the stoop of my shoulders, the sadness in my eyes.  I wasn’t an unhappy child.  But my body bore the scars of a society that didn’t accept me.  Multiple surgeries, months in the hospital.  And all because Mom was convinced there was something wrong with me.

“Can I give you a name?” I asked the crow.  He didn’t respond, but I took it as a yes.  “I’ll call you Casper.  Do you visit here often?”

A loud noise from nearby scared the birds into a large black cloud.  They scattered across the sky.  I stood up, dusting the dirt from my legs.  “Bye Casper!”  Remembering that crows liked trinkets, I pulled the button off of my sweater and left it on the tracks.  I hoped Casper and his friends would like it.

Dad came home later smelling of cleaning products.  His weary smile lit the apartment.  “Hey Annielou.  How was your day?”

“Good.  I made a new friend.”

He smiled softly.  I loved that look on his face.  It reminded me of good memories.  He scooped me up into a hug.  “I’m going to shower and then we can make dinner.”

“Ramen or Mac n’ Cheese?”  I grinned.

“Surprise me.”

I put some water on the stove for boiling.  I was very careful not to touch anything hot.  Dad taught me how to cook simple things.  Mom would have probably been mortified, but she didn’t know where we were.  It was better that way.  She was the one who made me go to the doctors.  They would touch me with their gloves and instruments.  Measuring, guessing.  My mother didn’t care how much I hated it.

“It’s necessary,” she said.

When we lived with her I remember Dad arguing.  “She’s a little girl!  There’s nothing wrong with her!”

“There is!” she’d scream.  “I want my daughter to be normal.”

“So you have them stitch her up?  It makes no sense!”  I didn’t know what the words meant, but I could feel the anger behind them.  And somewhere, deep inside me, I could feel the loss.  Something had been taken.  Removed with a scalpel in the name of normalcy.  

“You have no idea how sick she is.”

“I’m not going to let you keep hurting her.”

“And what are you going to do about it?”

Three nights later we were sneaking out, one bag for each of us.  Dad held my hand as tight as he could.  He explained that Mom was not doing the right thing and the only way to keep me safe was to move.  I nodded.  I knew it was true.  He kissed my head and we walked to the bus stop.  Two tickets to nowhere and we were gone.  Like Casper flying into the clouds.

That was a year ago.

I didn’t know if Mom was looking for me.  I hoped she wasn’t.  I really liked being able to leave the house and not being in pain all the time.  Doctors were scary to me.  Dad didn’t make me go, even when I twisted my ankle.  He iced it for me and said if it got really bad he would take me in, but he would never leave me.  I trusted him.  And it got better.  

The next day after school I went back to the train tracks.  I got food all over my shirt so the nurse had to give me a new one.  It was five sizes too big and said the words “Mike’s Truck Stop” on the front.  The kids had a field day with it.  I didn’t have any friends at school.  There was something about me that didn’t mesh with them.  Maybe it was the thing Mom talked about.  But during class I saw some crows fly by and I knew I’d be able to visit them as soon as the bell rang.

I sat down quietly, breathing in the scent of the railyard.  The crows hopped around curiously.  Casper flew down just a few feet away.  I smiled.  “Did you get the button I left you?”

He cocked his head.  I took that as a yes.

“I don’t have any buttons today, but I can bring you more tomorrow.  I can also look for some shiny rocks.  I think y’all like shiny things.  I do too.”

Casper hopped a little closer.  He let out a small caw.

I grinned.  “You’re the friendliest bird I ever met!”

He suddenly looked behind me and took off, flying so close I could have touched him.  I heard the rocks moving and I got to my feet as fast as I could.  But I was slow, and the kids were already next to me.

“Hey Man, making friends with road kill now?”

It was Sarah.  She was the meanest girl in class.  She was a full head taller than me and knew it.  Sarah liked to trip me or push me when no one was looking.  I don’t know what I did to her to make her so angry.

“Sarah, I’m just going to go home.”

She wasn’t alone.  Rob and Mikey were behind her, laughing.  They never touched me but they sure liked to watch.

“Not yet, Man.  I figured I’d better take that shirt back.”  She rushed for me and before I knew it she was trying to rip off the shirt.  I struggled, but my legs got all twisted and I fell hard onto the tracks.  I heard the shirt rip.

Sarah was laughing so hard she spit on me.  I tried to cover myself with the bits of fabric still left.  The boys stood off the side, hiding their smiles behind their hands.  I couldn’t hold in my tears.

I thought for a second my tears had blurred my vision.  But I wiped my eyes and it became clear.  Sarah wasn’t laughing anymore.  She stood still, mouth open.  Her left eye hung from its socket.  It had been plucked out neatly.  All I had seen was a black flash and then…

“What did you do?” Sarah cried, grasping at her face.  Her eye bounced on her cheek like a tetherball when she moved.  Her screams were horrible.  The boys took one look at her and ran away.  Something kept her from running as she tried desperately to put her eye back inside.

“I didn’t do it!  I swear!”

The black flash returned, except I saw it clearly now.  It was Casper, driving viciously towards Sarah’s face.  His razor sharp beak ripped into her top lip, dragging it with him as he flew up into the sky.  Sarah fell to her knees.  Before either of us could move a blizzard of black birds descended upon her, ripping and tearing at her skin.  A bird would swoop down and fly away from a clump of hair, flesh, or fabric.  Her screams died down when a crow had severed her vocal cords.  

I ran.  It was a blind action - something my body did without warning.  It took off away from the murder scene and back to the safety of the apartment.  I don’t know how long it took me to get back, but I reached the door and shut it behind me, sobbing.  It couldn’t have been real.  But then, why was my shirt tattered?  Why did my skin glitter with flecks of blood?

Slowly the realization set in that I had to change before Dad came home.  If he saw me like this would he take me back to the doctors like Mom did?  I threw the remains of the shirt away and showered.  The water couldn’t get hot enough.  I still felt like parts of Sarah were stuck on me.

When Dad came home I barely spoke.  He was so tired from work he didn’t mention it.  We ate plain noodles with salt.  He mentioned taking me to the free zoo that weekend.  I nodded, a part of me still back on the tracks.  Was Sarah’s body still there?  Or was it just a collection of bones by now?

At school the next day Rob and Mikey stared at me.  They didn’t come close, but they wouldn’t take their eyes off me.  I could feel them as viscerally as I could still feel Sarah’s blood on my skin.  I tried to pay attention in class but I was distracted by the crows outside.  There were too many.  They covered the playground and lawn.  Some perched above, others hopped along the grass.  Was it normal to see this many?  I caught a glimpse of Casper swooping by, something shiny in his beak.  I put my head in my hands, horrified. 

At lunch I didn’t go outside.  I just sat in the lunchroom, watching the birds.  I almost didn’t hear Mikey’s voice behind me.

“Did you tell those crows to kill her?”

I spun around.  Mikey and Rob were huddled a little ways away.  They were scared, but also…curious?

“No,” I sputtered.  “I would never.”

Rob took a step closer.  “It seemed like you did.  It seemed like they listened to you.”

I shook my head.  “I didn’t, I swear.”

“Are you going to tell them to kill us?”  Mikey stepped closer too.

“You don’t have to kill us,” Rob said quickly.  “We won’t bother you ever.  We’ll do whatever you want!”

“I’m not going to kill you,” I said quietly, my hands falling to my side.

“Thank you,” the boys said in unison.  They backed away from me and left the room.

I turned back to the window.  Casper was right there, sitting on the other side of the glass.  I jumped backward, surprised to see him so close.  He cawed loudly and motioned his head towards me.  I wanted to run away but I felt something important.  His eyes were at my stomach, cawing at me and pointing with his beak.  I touched my abdomen.  Something was poking out of my belly button.  I hadn’t noticed it before.  Hands weak, I lifted my shirt slowly.  

Growing from my belly button was a small, black feather.  

I screamed and tried to pull it out of me.  It wouldn’t budge.  It felt like trying to pull off a limb.  A teacher approached me, worried about my screams.  I faced her and when she saw the feather she backed away.  The confusion in her eyes reminded me of the doctors Mom took me to.  I ran past her and out of the school.

I could hear the crows cawing behind me as I ran home.  I sobbed.  As I ran the caws turned into something else.  Something I understood.  

“Anne!  Anne!  Anne!”  

“Stop!  Stop!  Stop!”  

And then, chillingly, “Come home!”

My legs burned when I reached the apartment.  I fled inside.  Without thinking I went to the kitchen and picked up the sharpest knife.  It wasn’t anything fancy, but it would do.  I took hold of the small feather, sure of my next step. I began to cut it off.  Blood poured from the feather.  It was unspeakably painful.  Determined, I hacked at it.  My hands turned red.  I don’t know how long it took to cut through that tiny feather.  But I did it.  It was in my hand, shriveling.  Breathing, in a way.  I smiled as I passed out.

I woke up in a hospital.  I could hear my father’s distant voice arguing with someone.  My stomach hurt.  I touched it and found it bandaged.  An IV was in my hand.  I opened my eyes and saw Dad speaking to a doctor.  He was angry.  The doctor turned to look at me, saying something softly.  Dad looked at me and rushed to my side.

“Oh Annielou,” he said, beginning to cry.  “I am so sorry.”

“For what,” I tried to say, but my voice sounded wrong.  Screechy. 

He wiped his eyes and took my hand in his.  “We are going to figure this out.  Don’t worry.  There is a specialist in this kind of thing.  We will go and find you help.”

“I don’t want to go,” I said again, but wrong.  I was cawing.

He cried harder as a woman came out from behind him.  She wore a white lab coat and her hair was up in a messy bun.  She touched her glasses and smiled thinly.

“Fascinating,” she said.

Dad looked at her and then back to me.  “Anne, this is [Dr. Wrom](https://www.reddit.com/r/EZmisery/comments/xbl9dh/the_institute_links/).  You are going to go stay at her institute for a little bit until we can figure things out.”

“No,” I exclaimed.  I screeched.  I cawed.  “You said you would never leave me!”

“It’ll be okay,” he said, as if he could understand.  “I will visit you.  I won’t let anything bad happen to you.”

Dr. Wrom cocked her head.  Despite being just an ordinary woman, she looked sinister.  Her fingers went to her face, tracing her smile.  “It’s going to be fun.”

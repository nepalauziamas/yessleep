Last Saturday was a miracle. If I didn't go to the library Saturday, I would have been killed. Everyone was in real danger. I am glad that I went to the library Saturday. This day will hunt me forever.
      _______________________________________________

I love going to the library to study because I hate studying at home alone. It's one of my favourite libraries because it's quiet and close to my home, so I can easily go there with my bicycle.


On Saturday afternoon, I took my bicycle to go to study in the library, but something weird happened on my way.

 The problem is that I zoned out and I didn't notice that there was a black cat in front of me. That's so weird because I don't know when this cat appeared suddenly out of nowhere or maybe I didn't notice. Suddenly, my bike hit something and I fell off, hurting my knees. But I fell in front of the black cat.

While I was on the ground, I looked at my knees and they looked really badly hurt. Then I took a look at the cat to see if it was hurt. But the cat was not hurt at all and was okay.But the odd thing about the cat was that she didn't move at all and was just staring at me.

The cat had strong blue eyes and very black fur. There was a blue collar around the cat's neck with (Yana) written on it. I figured out that this cat had run away from the owner. I tried to feed the cat something from my bag, but the cat refused to eat or even drink water. 
But something about the cat seemed odd and not normal.

While I was still on my knees, I turned to look behind me; the road was so quiet, I could only hear the sound of birds chirping.

 I turned my head to look at the cat, but something weird happened. The cat's eyes were no longer blue, but they were white, and the cat looked not normal at all. This time, the cat was standing on the ground and there was a shadow of a person, not a cat.

 Then suddenly, I hear the cat meowing in a weird way. The cat said "Run!" a few times. It said it like a deep human voice. 
My heart was beating non-stop, so I took my bicycle and ran to the library as fast as I could. But the cat didn't leave me. She started running after me very fast. I was so terrified and I felt that I may have fallen off the bike again because I kept looking behind me most of the way.

 Fortunately, I lost the cat and finally entered the library.
I took my breath and I exhaled deeply. I studied for a few hours, but I couldn't focus most of the time because I was in complete shock about what happened. I thought everything was just my imagination, but everything seemed real.

I had an urge to share what happened to me because I was so anxious, nervous, and couldn't concentrate, so I thought that maybe if I shared what happened to me with someone it would get better. But unfortunately, that's not what I expected. When I shared my story with the stranger next to me, I got more scared and nervous than before. 

The stranger next to me named Thomas proved to me that I was not crazy.

I shared with him everything that occurred today on my way to the library, and he said the exact thing happened to him while he was heading back home with his car.

Thomas told me that he saw a black cat while he was driving, so he stopped to check her out. He saw the blue collar and the name (Yana), but the cat didn't tell him to "RUN," but instead the cat said "Behind you!" two times.

 Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching him, so when he looked behind him, he saw 

"Someone holding a knife, wearing a black hoodie, a sleep eye mask with two holes, and a normal surgical mask. He was dressed all in black except that he wore a large blue necklace around his neck." 

The stranger in the library said that's all he could remember. He even drew the man on a piece of paper. He then told me that he took his car and ran straight home.
Thomas thought that he was just imagining things. But now we both know that it's all true and we aren't crazy.

After hearing Thomas's story, I felt really bad, so I decided to go back home, but I was too scared that this killer would hurt me or anyone else.

I noticed the librarian's sad face before I exited the library, so I decided to ask him what's wrong?

"Is everything okay?" I asked him because he seemed very sad. I come to the library here often, so it's the first time I've noticed the way his face is so sad.

"My cat died today," he told me with a shaking voice and teary eyes.

"How did your cat die?" I replied.

" I don't know, Yana was so normal, but after I came back from work, I saw her sleeping in front of the house door. I tried to wake her up but she didn't wake up. I went to the doctor and the doctor said that she was poisoned. I don't know how because I live home alone. Why would anyone do such a bad thing to Yana? She is so sweet and adorable. I loved her a lot." 

Thomas and I were shocked and speechless when the librarian said Yana was poisoned.

"Where do you live?" I asked the librarian.

"I live near the library, not that far," he responded.

I predicted that the road where Thomas and I found the cat was not that far from the library. Which means that me, the librarian, and most people who live in this area are in danger. The hoddie masked man can hurt us all.

So before we left the library, we warned the librarian about (the hooded masked man) and that he was not safe and that he must leave this area as soon as possible and call the police.

Now we concluded that (Yana) the librarian cat was warning us and giving us all a sign that we must not ignore.

 All this time, the cat (Yana) wanted to save us.

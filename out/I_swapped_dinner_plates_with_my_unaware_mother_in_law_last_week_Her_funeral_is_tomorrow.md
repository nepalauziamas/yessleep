I’ve known my husband since high school. We were friends for the longest time before we started to date, which eventually led to our marriage. 
    
My mother in law has always been a precise person. Things needed to be perfect for her to be happy. If something looked off to her in the slightest, she had to fix it immediately. 
    
The only time she ever relaxed was when she was drunk, which happened seldom. That was her first mistake.
    
Last Thursday, my mother in law sent out a message in the family group chat on my husband’s side. She was hosting a gathering that Saturday at 6 pm(18:00) sharp. Her message was formal and type out carefully, the opposite of how I write. 
    
That wasn’t the only way of living we didn’t share. I’m a very laid back person. I do things because I want to do them, not because other people think I should do them. I don't let others influence my lifestyle.
    
My mother in law sure has tried to, though. She seems to think that since she’s made everyone else in the family ‘perfect’, she can do the same with me, too. 
    
No one in our family is actually perfect, though. They only pretend to be in order to appease the beast. I won’t be pressured into being somebody I’m not, no matter how much I’m nagged about it. 
    
But the nagging had stopped recently. The one time I went over to her house before the party, my mother in law didn’t make a snarky comment about me once. We even had a conversation over tea. Maybe this could be a turning point in our relationship, I thought. It wasn’t. 
    
I never would have noticed something was off. My mother in law greeted the family in her stiff, curt manner. The house was spotless when we stepped inside, as per usual.
    
As soon as they settled, the guests began to drink. Nothing too heavy though, mother in law would be upset if anyone misbehaved when it came time to eat.
    
To most of our surprise, she poured herself a glass of wine when she sat down with us. My husband, who sat on the sofa beside me, whispered that he’d only seen his mother drinking four times in his entire life.
    
It was odd, but I didn’t look too deep into it. She probably was just nervous about the party, with the constant tap of her foot to the floor.
    
When dinner time came around, my mother in law was full-on drunk. She slurred her words as she announced the meal she had prepared. Turkey, sausage, roasted peppers, mashed potatoes, and homemade gravy. It looked delicious. 
    
I scooped up portions of each onto my plate and made a quick escape from the kitchen to wash my hands. I didn’t even notice the vile my mother in law was holding as I passed her. 
    
When I came back and we all sat down at the dinner table, my plate was right where I left it. Except I noticed something different. I never, ever, put gravy on my potatoes; so who did?
    
Whatever, I’ll just get a new portion and give the other to someone else. I headed back into the kitchen, and was surprised to see that all of the potatoes had been taken. Come to think of it, my mother in law hadn’t baked a huge amount of mashed potatoes in the first place. 
    
I’ll just switch with whoever in the family liked gravy and had a similar plate of food to mine. Everyone had already started eating when I got back, however. The only person who wasn’t at the table was, you guessed it, my husband’s mother. She was occupied trying to calm down one of her wailing grandchildren and failing miserably. 
    
With so much on her hands, as well as the alcohol in her system, she didn’t notice I took her plate of food and replaced it with mine. 
    
Dinner was great. I had no idea I’d just narrowly escaped death. My mother in law was quiet the entire time we said goodbyes, half-assing every hug that she was given. 
    
My husband is the type of person to take years to say his goodbyes, so I sat back down on the couch and waited for him to finish. I only really gave goodbyes to the people I knew well, my husband's two cousins and aunt. I’d known them since they surprised my husband with a visit whilst I was hanging out with him all those years ago. 
    
I almost jumped out of my skin when I felt a hand touch my bare shoulder. It was my mother in law, looking panicked. She asked me if I’d had gravy on my mashed potatoes and I responded truthfully. 
    
Her eyes went wide and she looked like she was about to cry. I didn’t have the chance to interrogate her because my husband was calling for me. 

We finally left the house and were headed back to our own place. Though I do love a good get together, that night was exhausting. I couldn’t shake the feeling something was terribly wrong, though.

I ignored it for the next couple of days, focusing only on work and keeping the house clean. Until one day I came home to my husband sitting on the couch in tears. His mother had passed away from some sort of unknown poisoning.

And that’s how I got here; typing out my little story the night before my mother in law’s funeral while my husband sleeps peacefully next to me. He hadn’t gotten a proper rest since she passed, mourning and planning the funeral did a number on him.

I trust my husband and I know he trusts me too, but if I told him what I thought was planned to happen that night he wouldn’t believe me. He’d probably hate me for even thinking his mother would try to hurt me.

She’s never done it before, so why now? I’ve been trying to tell myself this but I just can’t believe it. If she was innocent, why did she drink an abnormal amount of alcohol? Why did she slather gravy on my potatoes when she knew I wouldn’t eat it? And why would she ask me about it right before we left? 

This has to be a mistake, it has too. It must all just be a coincidence. But I can’t let it go. I’m such a terrible person for thinking my mother in law tried to poison me. Or, is she the terrible person? I don’t even know anymore

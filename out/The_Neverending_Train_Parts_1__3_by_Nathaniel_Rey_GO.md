My uncle told me a story that he said was true. I still can't prove it but his story is this:

The Neverending Train PART 1

A tired detective just finished his latest and  most hardest case yet. He and his assistant was going to head back to their office. It was 6:30Pm, and they thought it was gonna be a long night. Little did they know that it was gonna be too long. They went on a train that was going to take about an hour and 30 minutes before they reach their destination. 


They went on board the electric train at about 6:45Pm. It was very strange because there was only 8 people on the train including him and his assistant. There was a teen girl, a man who looked like a business man, a boy with his mother, an adult man, and a old woman who looked like she was 50+ years old. 


Finally the train started to move and since he was tired he told his assistant that he was going to take a nap. He knew that they would arrive at about 8:15Pm. After about 1 hour and 15 mins of napping he woke up and nothing changed at all except that 2 of the passengers fell asleep. The detective expected them to arrive at their destination 15 mins later. Time passes by and 15 minutes have passed and it was 8:15Pm. The strange thing was that the time wasn't changing, it always remained the same time, and it never changed.


The other passengers noticed this too, and it is impossible that all of their watches are broken. They were all very confused, then when everybody was distracted the lights went off. Everybody was scared, when their eyes got used to the dark they saw a woman that was floating about an inch off the ground with long hair that was covering her face. The woman disappeared as the lights turned on, and to their horror the business man's head was lying on the ground while his lifeless and headless body was still on the bloody train seat. The time is 8:15Pm.



The Neverending Train Part 2

After the horrible event, people were panicking, and they didn't know what to do. All they know was that they could die soon, and that they needed to get off this train quickly. They checked the time and still it was 8:15Pm. They wondered why the woman disappeared when the lights turned off. Then they realized that the ghost can't attack while the light was open. The good thing was that the business man had a phone with him they took his phone from his body and used it for a flashlight.


The detective, the adult man, and the teen girl had a phone so they used it everytime the lights turned off to stop the ghost. They all went went away from the front part of the train and started heading back to see if they could find a way out. While they were exploring the back of the train they noticed a drop of blood following them on the floor. They knew that they couldn't continue like this and that someone is going to die soon.
 
The people with flashlights protect the people without flashlights so that everyone is safe. The attacks are becoming more frequent. They all reached the middle of the train when the lights turned off they opened their flashlights but the woman was enough that the kid's head was torn off.


The lights turned back on and now only 6 are alive. The mother mourned on the headless body of her son. They reminded her that they needed to keep going to find a way out. With another death they began to lose hope and instead of only 1 drop of blood following them now it was 3 drops. 


The lights turned off once again at least it seemed to, but the lights just turned red. Their flashlight stopped working, and they heard a little girl crying so they went to look for the girl. They couldn't find her, but what worried them more is that if the woman attacked now they wouldn't be able to stop her. After a while the crying was louder than before, then the ghost appeared again, with no way to stop her another 2 died, the old woman, and the teen girl. After both were beheaded, the lights turned back to normal, and laying on the floor were 2 headless bodies. 4 left. The time is 8:15Pm.

The Neverending Train Final Part

They started thinking that they were never going to get out of this death train. The detective encouraged them that they would find a way out of the neverending train as long as they keep going. Suddenly they heard creepy laughing near the front part of the train they knew the ghost was going to strike soon. 

While the other people were resting the detective saw a shiny thing near the back of the train. He thought I could help them get out, but what he didn't know was that it was luring him to the back of the train. He just wanted rest, and to feel safe again so he kept going towards the shining object. The others didn't notice that the detective was gone, they tried searching for him, but he was hopelessly gone. With the disappearance of the one who was leading them they knew their time would come soon.


Meanwhile the man reached the end of the train. When he reached the end there was nothing there, no shining thing or even a way out. He too has lost hope. He turned around to go back to the others, but all he saw was a wall in front of him. That wall hasn't been there at all he thought, it's impossible for a wall to just appear out of nowhere. 


Finally the lights turned red once again, the windows, the seats, and the walls were all covered in blood. The woman appeared knowing the detective's flashlight doesn't work anymore. The man knew that his time had come, even though he was going to die he was happy that it would finally come to an end. The woman went swiftly towards him then... "boss wake up we're here! ". "Huh? Um o-ok".


"That was a really strange dream", he thought. They went out of the train after a minute, and when the detective looked back at the train he saw the woman writing "until next time" with blood on the window. He blinked and suddenly nothing was there. He knew something was wrong so he looked at his watch for the final time to check if the time had passed. To his shock, 


The time was 8:15Pm

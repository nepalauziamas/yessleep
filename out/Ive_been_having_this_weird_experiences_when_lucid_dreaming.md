The first time it happened i was 8 years old, I was dreaming about a school field trip. 

We where all in a school bus driving up hill on our way to some far away place, as we drove on a very slim and twisty road, like the ones you see in movies, leading to some creepy castle, all the kids were doing whatever kids do on a buss ride,Â chattering, playing, just regular stuff but I was watchig through the window as the driver started to strugle to keep the buss steady on the road, sudently I noticed we where going pretty fast and an ominous feeling overcame me, like something wrong was about to happen and surley enough, as my chest tightened, I could feel the harsh brakes gripping, the tires biting on the dirt and the driver loosing control of the buss. 

We hit a retainer, The buss bounced making a 360 flip and we ended up hanging halfway outside the road, the buss was barely balancing on the edge of the cliff, it was just like in the movies. 

We all went flying all the way to the back of the buss, and as I hit the back door, it slams open and we all fall out the buss. 
Miraculously we end up grabbing each others feet, making a human chain, me being one before the last kid. 

It was so real, I trully believe I was going to die, but as I thought that, I suddenly realized I was dreaming and immediately stopped fraking out. As I started to calm down, I turned to the last kid, the one grabbing my feet, to let him know we were going to be ok because this was my dream and that ment I could be able to control it but just as I was in the middle of my sentence, he climb on me, like a freaking spider, grab me so tight by my shirt collar, looked at me straigh to the eyes and I swear to god, with the most empty voice I've heard, he said: 

" so you are aware of it, you cannot be here anymore" I woke up instantly, sweating like I have been swimming. 

I went to the bathroom to dry myself up with chills still up my spine, trully freaked out of my mind but glad to be awake. As I was standing in front of the mirror, I notice a very distinctive mark on my neck, like the one a rope would give you, in the exact same spot I was being choked by that kid in my dream. 

I must clarify I have always slept without my shirt off, makes me super  unconformable and also my mum noticed it the next day, so I know I'm not crazy. 

I fliped out y'all, actually got me pretty freaked out for a while, I was so scared I didn't even told anyone because I thought it would make it worse. 

Eventully I moved out my mom's house, and I forgot everything about it until it started happening again and it has been happening since but now I live alone in a small house in the middle of the woods and I really hate waking up alone to check my self in the mirror for marks and scratches at 3:00 am. im 36 years old now and its still freakes me up.

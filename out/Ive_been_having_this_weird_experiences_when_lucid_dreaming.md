The first time it happened i was 8 years old, I was dreaming about a school field trip. 

We where all in a school bus, driving up hill on our way to some far away place, as we drove on a very slim and twisty road, like the ones you see in movies leading up to castles, all the kids were doing whatever kids do on a buss ride,Â chattering, playing, just regular stuff but I, on the other hand, was watchig through the window as the driver started struggling to keep the buss steady on the road, I also noticed we where going pretty fast and an ominous feeling overcame me, like something wrong was about to happen, then surley enough, as my chest tightened, I could feel the harsh brakes gripping, the tires biting on the dirt and the driver loosing control of the buss. 

We hit a retainer, The buss bounced on it making a 360 flip and we ended up backwards,  hanging halfway outside the road, the buss was barely balancing on the edge of the cliff, it was just like in the movies. 

We all went flying all the way to the back of the buss because of the inclination and as I hit the back door, it slamed open making us fall out the buss, miraculously we ended up grabbing each others feet, making a human chain, me being one before the last kid. 

It was so real, I trully believe I was going to die right there, but just as I thought that, I suddenly realized I was dreaming and immediately stopped fraking out.
As I started to calm down, I turned to the last kid, the one grabbing my feet, to let him know we were going to be ok because this was my dream but just as I was in the middle of my sentence, he climb me on, like a freaking spider, grab me so tight by my shirt collar, looked at me straigh to the eyes and I swear to god, with the most empty voice I've heard, he said: 

" so you are already aware of it, don't you?, you cannot be here anymore" 

I woke up instantly, sweating like I have been swimming, I then went to the bathroom to dry myself up with chills still running up my spine, trully freaked out of my mind but glad to be awake. 
As I was standing in front of the mirror, I notice a very distinctive mark on my neck, like the one a rope would give you, in the exact same spot I was being choked by that kid in my dream. 

I must clarify, I have always slept with my shirt off, it makes me super unconformable to have a a shirt while sleeping and also my mum noticed the mark the next day, so I know I'm not crazy. 

I fliped out y'all, actually got me pretty freaked out for a while, I was so scared I didn't even told anyone because I thought it would make it worse and maybe keep happening.

Eventully I moved out of my mom's house, and I forgot everything about it, until it started happening again and it has been happening ever since, its just that I now  live alone, in a small house in the middle of the woods and I really hate waking up alone at 3:00 am to check my self in the mirror for marks and scratches. I'm 36 years old now and its still freakes me out.

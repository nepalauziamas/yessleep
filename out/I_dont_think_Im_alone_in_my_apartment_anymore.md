My brother Ty  had just moved out of our two bedroom apartment to be with his new girlfriend. Things were getting serious with the two of them after a decent amount of time. 14 months? Something like that. 

I was sad at the same time, now I’d be by my lonesome on the balcony in the evenings. I’d probably lose the motivation to cook more, because cooking with friends and family is always better than doing it alone for me. I’d have to pinch pennies more while looking for a new roommate, but my landlord cut me a deal and reduced my rent by a third for three months.

I was happy for him as well, but not everyone is close with their siblings and my older brother is basically my best friend and role model. I knew it was good for him to get serious with Corrina but still… 

It was only four days since he’d left, and I felt like the loneliest soul on the planet. Hearing that I was the best man he knew at least once a week kept my self-worth intact. 

Except, I don’t really think I AM alone in my apartment anymore. 

First it was the small, subtle sounds I’d hear from the empty room. Noises like the walls being bumped slightly, or something ruffling the blinds on the window. Usual shit that’d the wind could possibly conjure up. I didn’t pay much heed to it, but every now and then when I’d hear the bumps during the day, it gave me small hope that Ty was home.

Not gonna lie, I cried some tears of happiness, then sorrow when the all too familiar noises ceased. I missed him. I wanted to call him daily like how my mom did when Ty and I moved out together three years ago. I gave him some space, however. Corrina was wonderful, but she was slightly possessive of my brother and I didn’t want to butt in.

I felt a bit weary when these subtle noises would happen at 2am. Bumps and shuffles from the vacant room, while the wind was at a standstill did not comfort me. An intruder? The third night after I started hearing these noises at night, I got my knife ready and crept over to the empty room. Being clumsy in the dark, I shoulder-checked the door lightly before opening it. I heard the blinds being caressed- then nothing. 

I swallowed my fear and after three eternity length seconds, I swung the door open, knife ready with the other hand. Empty. The blinds still swayed slightly, something was definitely here a moment ago. I left the door open and slowly backed away into my room. I didn’t hear the noise for the rest of the night, and I was awake for most of it. 

Next was the sound of something light being dragged across the floor in the living room. This time, I wasn’t under the illusion my brother miraculously returned in the morning. It had now been two weeks since he moved out, and only two days since the thudding in the next door room had ceased.  

I layed in my bed, my covers wrapped around me in the middle of a hot summer morning listening to the sound. Whatever it was, I could hear it bumping the table and chairs just outside the dining room. It was brushing up against the walls as well. Knowing my phone was in reach, I called 9-11 to report an intruder in my house.

Loud banging on the door was a relief, I knew who it was. The police requested entry, and I yelled at them to come in as I refused to move. I knew my hiding spot– my room, was compromised by yelling but the cops would apprehend whatever was breaking into my house. I felt somewhat safe. 

Strangely enough, I didn’t hear them kicking down my door. Odd, I had locked it like I always did at night before bed. Boots on the ground echoed over the noises of the intruder and soon enough, an officer came into my cluttered mess of a room and began to question me. Not long after, the other officers came in and assured me whatever was in my apartment was now out. They didn’t find anything.

Given my mental state during the event, they didn’t deem my call as a prank so I got no warnings. Thank god. I wasn’t satisfied with them not catching anyone, or anything, but the noises I was hearing in my apartment began to dwindle down significantly. 

About a month after the strange occurrences that would silence themselves from time to time is when I had my breaking point with whatever was in my apartment. 

I had just come back from a party at my friend’s place. I had stayed the night there, and spent most of the day there as well so it wasn’t till the evening when I went back home. When I parked my car and began walking towards the foyer, I took a glance at my balcony. I immediately halted in my tracks, unable to process what I saw. 

There was a…face pressed against the glass door that led to the balcony. Only three floors up, it was easy to see from a distance. It was upside down, and based on how high up on the glass door it was it was either very tall or clinging to the ceiling. White, wispy locks hung on each side of its face. Its skin was pale and thin enough I could nearly see the muscles and nerves through it. I screamed, in both fear and in anger at the entity in my home.

Its reaction bothered me.

It frowned. It looked as forlorn as I did every fucking time I looked in the mirror knowing I was alone in the place. I saw myself in this intruder, and for a moment I had a bit of courage. Whatever it was, maybe I could reason with it, and it would leave me alone. 

As I got closer to the apartment, it retreated away from the window and deeper into my living room. I marched up the stairs and planned on doing what the cops couldn’t, getting this thing to leave me alone.  I didn’t bother with the elevator like I normally did, I needed to get my body warmed up just in case. I unlocked my door and kicked it open with gusto. 

I didn’t hear anything as I stepped inside. Didn’t even take my shoes off. Closed the door behind me, but I didn’t lock it. I inspected the glass, an odd slime where it was pressing against was still remaining there. Good to know the cops would have evidence this time if it came to it. 

I inspected the floors and ceiling. I saw little holes in the plaster above…it formed a pattern that looked like a small being with claws, nearly like a cat’s. I grabbed my cleaver from the knife block, going bigger and badder, and tracked the holes in the ceiling. 

They led to the empty room. Dust had begun coating the floor and windows. I…hadn’t been bringing myself into Ty’s old room often. The tracks ceased in front of the window. I got my shit together for a moment and took a deep breath.

“Alright!” I demanded. “I know you’re in here, I saw you in my apartment from the ground so you best come out of hiding!” I didn’t know I had it in me, maybe it was simply all the sadness I had buried away from being isolated transforming into another more useful emotion. 

“I don’t want to hurt you, but if you’re going to show up and scare me with your unwelcome presence, then you’ll have to take a beating when I see you! But you best come clean! We can maybe sort this out!” I could sense my anger turning into pleading and reason. 

Nothing.

Before going to inspect my own room I heard the blinds rustle and I darted around. 

Materializing from what I thought was the dust on the floor, was this…thing appearing. It was maybe half my height, but it sported long, thin nails. It didn’t wear anything but a wispy cloth around its groin, but it had the body of a normal human. Its most disturbing feature was the face. I didn’t notice it when it was so pressed against the glass but it had…my face. My face from when I was a kid. 

It waved at me, then hopped, attaching itself on the ceiling and crawling towards my room. 

I didn’t have the words, my body ran on its own towards my room. It was faster than me. I heard the sound of paper being ripped and the sound of scribbling before I knew it. I bolted to my room to confront the dusty demon when it held a sheet of ripped paper on it. It waved it at me and I peered at the messy writing on it.

*Ty brother is friendly. Best man he knows.* 

I was taken aback, this thing knew my brother?  This entity smiled, the same smile in my younger days. It went back to write more. It showed me again. 

*He misses you too. He want you to not be alone*

I felt the tears well up in my eyes. I didn’t know what to say. The thing held out its hand to me. I was hesitant at first, but if my brother truly sent this thing to make sure I had a friend…then wouldn’t I be safe? 

I shook its hand and it smiled, before dispersing back into dust. The dust particles drifted towards the empty room. Sorry, *its* room. Even the dust from the handshake blew off my hand. I wiped my tears away, and enjoyed a quiet night of sleep. 

I’m not sure what I’m to say to Ty next time I call him. I’m sure he’d give me an explanation. Very odd choice to keep me company, but it’s the sentiment that counts. 

It’s been five days since I saw that thing. I want to name it, I have evidence it's in the place still. It picks up all the dust in the house, and I know now that it waits for me to get home after work. I see it in the evenings, pressed up against the balcony doors. 

I’m still getting used to its appearance, but it will write notes to me and leave them around the house. Sweet things too, the same things my brother would say to me on a bad day. The grammar is a bit jumbled, almost like a toddler’s. 

I’m debating on getting another roommate in the future, but what I do know is I’m not alone in my apartment.

And for now, I think I'm ok with that.

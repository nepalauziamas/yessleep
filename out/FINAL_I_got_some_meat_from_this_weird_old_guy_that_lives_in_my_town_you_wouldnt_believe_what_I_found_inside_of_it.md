I decided to go to Rick's house after all, but I was afraid someone would follow me, so I went out the back door instead. I climbed over my back wall, then snuck out through the side of my neighbor's house. Rick’s place was just over a half mile away at the edge of town. I thought someone might be watching his house, so I took the long way through the forest. It took over an hour because I had to walk around the lake at the edge of the forest. I had planned on staking the place out from a distance, but it was overgrown with weeds, and I couldn’t see anything, and before I knew it, I was at the back of his shed. I walked around the perimeter of the property and when I didn’t see anyone, I quickly made my way into the shed, closing the creaky doors behind me. My heart was racing; I had never done anything like that before and I was sure someone had heard me.  

I watched through a crack in the door for a while, to make sure I was not seen, when I felt confident and was about to search, I noticed a vile smell, so I got my phone out and turned on the light. The whole place was in a mess, there was broken glass and wood all over the floor; it looked like someone had already searched the place. I didn’t know where to start and I hadn’t even brought a shovel. I saw a poker sticking out of a small stove in the corner and used that. I began by searching for loose earth, but there were no signs that showed anything was buried there. There was a dog bowl with the name “Shoggs” on it, under what was left of a table, beside it was a pile of bones, I guess that’s where the smell was coming from. I was sure it had to be there, so I started digging, but the soil was rock hard, and I had to give up after a few minutes. So, I moved around bit by bit. I must have checked every inch of that shed, but the soil was too hard to dig up with that shitty little poker.  

I began to think Rick was making a fool out of me again, and there was nothing buried in there, until I remembered what the note said about burning the shit, and I thought of the stove. I could see from where I was standing that there was a small bit of loose earth underneath. I disconnected the chimney pipe, then pushed the stove over and started to dig. It was not long before I found the jar, it was only about a foot deep. I was too afraid to open it there, so I put it in my backpack, had a good look around, before running as fast as I could, nearly the whole way home. I tried to sneak back in home the same way as I got out, but my neighbor was sitting on his back porch when I got there. I never actually met him, so I wasn’t sure how he would react, and I thought he was going to call the police. But luckily, he recognized me, I told him I locked myself out and he was actually very nice about it. 

As soon as I got in the door, I heard banging coming from upstairs, I had forgotten to feed the creature, and it sounded very hungry, I was sure it was going to break the door down. I had forgotten to buy any meat and couldn’t risk going out through my neighbors again. So, I checked the freezer and all I could find was some chicken nuggets. I wasn’t sure how he would react to processed food and didn’t want to give it to it, but it was making so much noise I had to try something. The banging suddenly stopped as I made my way up the stairs, when I got to the top, I noticed there was a big crack going down the middle of the door. I remember thinking, I hope this works or he is going to break out.  

When I opened the door, it was sitting in the middle of the floor again. I was surprised how calm and relaxed it looked. I grabbed a handful of nuggets, they were still frozen together and threw them over near it, I was expecting it to tear into it like a wild animal. But it just looked at me, then at the nuggets, then back to me, it was like it was asking for permission. I just nodded, I'm not sure why. Then it walked over and sat down in front of the nuggets and stared at me again. I think it wanted privacy, and I wanted out of there, so I left. As soon as I closed the door, it started to eat, I could hear it devour what was there in seconds, it sounded like a feeding frenzy. 

When I got downstairs I opened the jar straight away, the first thing I found was a letter, it said, “I’m sorry, I should never have left you with that shit, but bad people wanted to take that poor thing and turn it into a monster. You were the only one in that town that was ever nice to me, that’s why I chose you. You don’t realize the gift I gave you just yet, but you will. I call um watchers because that's all they do the first couple of months, watch, learning all your habits. So, they don’t take no training. They usually build a connection with the first thing they see, which was you, I hope, kind of like a baby chick when it first hatches. I don’t really know what they are, like you it was dropped off at my door 20 years ago, with a note and everything. So, I do know what you're going through, and to be honest, it don’t get any easier I'm sorry to say. But those creatures there are special, they can do amazing things, which you are only beginning to see, so please do not let it fall into the wrong hands, like I did.  

You are not the first person I trusted with one of these creatures, 10 years ago my Shoggs laid an egg. For a time after it hatched, its momma was really loving and protective, but after a while she got jealous I guess, and they started to fight. So, I needed to find a master for it, the only one in town I thought would treat it right, was a man I used to do odd jobs for, he was always nice to me and never judged me for the way I looked. I was sure I could trust him, but the watcher was too old to connect with him and could since the evil, even when I couldn’t. He kept it locked up and treated it like a monster and that’s what it turned into, it killed one of his goons one night, not long after the creature was gone, and he started buying up half the town.  

He has been waiting 10 years for this one, I couldn’t let him do that to another poor innocent creature., and they are innocent, its man that corrupts them. So, I dropped that off to you then packed up, before I left, I let my baby go, it was the hardest thing I ever did, but I am too old and it's too dangerous to bring her with me. Here is where the shit comes into it, they can smell it for miles, she is a gentle creature, but she will attack if she thinks you have her baby, so burn it before she comes looking.  

There are a few more things I have to say to you, they are important so don’t forget. First of all, you probably know by now it has turned into the last thing you fed it before it cocooned. They don’t stay that way unless you give them a good variety of meats, finding roadkill is a cheap way of doing this. Be careful, it only takes a few days of eating the same thing, before it starts to change, the bigger they get the more food they eat and they grow fast, you don’t want a cow running around the place.  

Second of all don’t ever let it go hungry because they do get fierce cranky real fast, and after a couple of days of being like that, they start to change into their true selves, and you don’t want to be seeing that, it will give you nightmares. 

Thirdly do not be around it when you're angry or it gets hard to control, it seems to feel what you feel but stronger. Also, it gets real protective so if you feel threatened it will try to defend you and you don’t want that. I got attacked by a pack of wild dogs once while out walking, after seeing what she did to them, I couldn’t look at her for a month. 

The last and most important thing I have to ask you, I know you don’t owe me anything, and you have every right to hate me, but please, move away from that dead end town, it’s not safe for you or your watcher. The contents of that jar there has taken a lifetime to save up, it's not much, but please use it to find somewhere safe for you both.  Good luck, Rick. 

There were thousands, wrapped in old newspaper in that jar. At first I thought, that was a lot to take in, but then suddenly it came to me and I knew exactly what to do. I'm sorry but Rick was wrong about me, I am not the nice guy he thought I was. I could not live my life in fear, always running and hiding, looking after some monster, I never asked for this anyways. I rang Tom Hogan and told him what I had, and he made me an offer I couldn’t refuse. In a way I was sad to say goodbye to that thing, I would have liked to no more, but money is money. 

When I went up to get him, the poor thing was still sitting there waiting for me. The place stank so I picked up the shit and put it in a bag. Then I said come on to the pig, at first I wasn’t sure what would happen, then it just followed me all the way to the car. When I opened the door, it climbed onto the back seat. The whole way there it stared at me, I think it trusted me, I started to feel bad for it, but it was too late, the deal was made. 

I parked down the road from Toms car lot so he couldn’t see me and walked up, he was waiting at the door with a big smile on his face. I was not stupid enough to bring the creature with me and he didn’t seem to mind. I asked him for the money, and he just handed it to me, without a second thought.  

He didn’t care when I told him I would be back with the creature either, he seemed very trusting; I suppose he thought he knew where to find me and probably had someone watching me too. On the way back I went in through the back of the car lot, with that bag of shit and rubbed it on everything starting with his brand-new merc.  

Ponytail was at the door when I returned, he didn’t say anything to me, he just picked up the pig and brought him inside. For the next few days, I stayed in a hotel. I figured it was safer there incase Tom or ponytail decided to change their minds about our deal. I heard a few days later they both went missing; the cops found all kinds of illegal shit when they searched that car lot for him. Some people think he had a falling out with the mob, others say he is living it up somewhere in South America, but I know better.

About  three years ago I moved to a small rural town in the Appalachian  mountains. I  packed up my clothes, put my cat, Lenny, in his carrying cage, grabbed  my old Alvarez guitar and headed to the mountains in my beat up Buick.

A  five hour drive winding through the oak and pine clustered woods of  rural Appalachia led me to my new life. My rusty Buick pulled down a  dark and dusty drive littered with pine needles and  empty beer cans.  The first home on the street was a tiny brick house that appeared to be  abandoned except for the black smoke coming out of the chimney. Beer  bottles were scattered all over the unkempt yard, overgrown with weeds  and ancient elms. A tall, grizzled looking man in a greasy white tank  waved at me with a cigarette in one hand and a Busch Light in the other.  I nodded back.

The next house was  about two acres past the first. It was an enormous white mansion with a  perfectly manicured lawn. I noticed a short, broad chested man with a  black suit and slicked back blonde hair sauntering toward a silver  Cadillac Escalade. He put two fingers to his forehead and saluted me as I  passed.

My house was a few more  acres past his. I pulled into the gravel driveway and took in my  surroundings. The house was beautiful. It was situated comfortably  between a slight cliff with low hanging pines and a clearwater brook  running off into the forest. I got out of my car, stretched my legs, and  picked up Lenny’s carrier. The porch was wide and cozy with a little  rocking chair in the western corner. As I reached for my keys, I heard a  gruff voice boom behind me.

“Hey, there! Are you the new neighbor?”

“Uhh, yea,” I said, holding myself back from being a sarcastic asshole and telling him, “No shit.”

“Nice  to meet ya!” the man bellowed at me from down the drive. It was the  burly man with the beer bottles covering his yard. He put his head down  and walked right up to Lenny and me. Lenny was never fond of strange men  approaching him and hissed. “Aww, what a cute little girl. What’s her  name?”

“His name’s Lenny.”

“I  got a cat too!” he responded, ignoring my correction. “Her name is  Ester! Maybe they can meet and have a cat play date sometime.”

“Sure,” I agreed, trying to end the conversation.

“But,  whatever you do, don’t let your cat out at night,” he warned. “There’s  been bears in this area. I heard one rootin’ through my trash the other  night. I opened up my door to yell at him and scare him away. Bastard  let out a terrible growl and I… well, I slammed the door shut and didn’t  make a peep till morning.”

“I’ll keep that in mind,” I said, trying to edge myself further away from my new neighbor. “Anyway, I got a lot to unpack”

“Oh,  don’t worry about me,” the man smiled. “People always said I talked too  much for my own good. I’ll be on my way. Name’s Kenny. Kinda like  Lenny.” He laughed. “Just let me know if you need anything and I’ll be  glad to help.”

“Thanks,” I said, forcing a smile. “See ya later, Kenny.”

“You never told me your name,” he shouted as I slammed the door in his face.

I  sat Lenny’s carrier on the floor and opened it up for him to pounce  out. He started purring and I collapsed to the wood floor. “Some people  have no idea how to respect personal space,” I said as Lenny crawled  onto my lap.

After a few hours of  unpacking, I heard a knock at my door. “Is that Kenny again? He really  is going to be a nuisance, isn’t he?”

I  pulled the door open and saw the man that lived in the mansion with the  Escalade. “Hello,” he said in a soothing voice. “I’m Clarence. Sorry to  bother you, just wanted to say a quick hello and be on my way.”

“Oh, no problem at all,” I said and stepped out onto the porch. “Nice to meet you.”

“You  as well,” he said extending a hand to shake. “I saw Kenny come over to  your house earlier and just wanted to make sure you weren’t so annoyed  by his presence that you decided to move out.”

I laughed and extended my hand to shake his. “Ah, he wasn’t too bad. A little intrusive, but no harm so far.”

“Oh, but he really is the worst,” said Clarence with a smirk. “He’s always going on about his cats.”

“He literally already tried to get me to bring my cat on a playdate with his cat,” I chuckled. “But at least he seems nice.”

“He may seem nice,” Clarence responded, “but I wouldn’t bring your cat over there.”

“Why not?” I asked with a hint of concern.

“Kenny  doesn’t have too good of a track record with cats. Every one he gets  dies within a month of him adopting them. It’s a sad cycle really. One  of his cats is killed in the night and he wakes up the neighborhood,  sobbing violently. Then he adopts a new one from the shelter next day.”

“Well that certainly is strange. I definitely won’t be letting my cat out. Are there really that many bears out here?”

“None  that I’ve ever seen,” Clarence replied. “I haven’t seen anything but  deer in these woods. In my honest opinion, I think Kenny’s just a  terrible pet owner. His lawn is covered in trash and he’s got broken  down farming equipment everywhere. The dude is a slob. He shouldn’t be  allowed to take care of an animal, let alone himself. Anyway, I better  get going. Nice to meet you!”

“You too,” I waved and Clarence sauntered down the driveway.

That  night, I drank pretty heavily. I had no furniture except a half futon  with a thin fold-able mattress and I was pretty uncomfortable being  alone in the mountains, so I got drunk. Lenny and I sat on the floor for  much of the night listening to rap music.

After  eleven beers, I got up to take a piss. The bathroom was a sliver of a  room with one window high up next to the shower. Before opening the lid  to the toilet, I peered out the window to see the view. It gave way to  my front yard. The cliff with the low hanging pines sat to the left and  the brook gleaming in the moon light to the right. Between the two was a  large figure on all fours. It slowly crept to the edge of the yard. It  wasn’t a deer. The shape was wrong. It looked like a bear with broad  shoulders. I quietly watched as it slinked off into the woods toward  Clarence’s house. I shrugged my shoulders and went back out to Lenny.  “Guess you’re never going outside again, buddy. There really are bears  in these woods.”

The next morning,  I awoke to the sounds of Kenny screaming. I rubbed my eyes and put on  some gym shorts before stepping out onto my porch.

“Ester’s dead!” he yelled. “Another got damn bear killed my beloved cat! Curse this God forsaken wood!”

Clarence,  clad in a fuzzy brown cashmere robe, ran out of his mansion toward  Kenny and put his arm around the inconsolable brute. “It’s alright,  buddy. Shhh, calm down. You can go to the shelter and pick yourself up  another one today.”

“I don’t want  another cat! I want Ester!” Kenny threw his hairy arms up into the sky  and cursed. “What kind of cruel joke is this? My cats always die.”

Not  wanting to join this meeting of neighbors, I slid my door shut without  making a sound. “Yeah, you’re never going outside, Lenny,” I said  petting my grey tabby. He curled up by my side on our futon on the  wooden floor.

Later in the day, I  heard another unwarranted knock at the front door. I sighed and opened  it up to discover Clarence. He had a bottle of bourbon in one hand and a  couple cigars in the other. “It’s been a pretty stressful day trying to  console Kenny,” he said with an eye roll. “Between him and his cat  problem and my anxiety getting ready to start the new school year, I  just need someone to talk to. Do you mind if I come in?”

“Not  at all,” I obliged. It had been two full days since I’d left my home  city and I was lonely and in need of good conversation. “Where do you  teach?”

“At the community college a few blocks away. I’m the biology professor there.”

“No shit!” I said in amusement. “I just got hired there. I’m the new Environmental Science professor.”

“Really?”  he said before taking a seat, legs crossed on the wooden floor. “That’s  awesome, man. It’s a really tight knit community. I think you’ll love  it there.”

The two of us chatted  for hours about our college days, the shitty minimum wage jobs we had in  our twenties, and why we decided to become college professors. It was  the most comfortable I had been since moving to the Appalachian  Mountains. I finally felt like I had a friend besides Lenny.

“So  what is the deal with Kenny and his cats?” I eventually asked. “It’s  really starting to creep me out. Like if he’s that irresponsible, why  does he keep adopting more cats? He should be banned from the shelter  and never allowed to adopt again.”

“He’s  a moron, if truth be told,” Clarence answered. “I feel bad for him.  He’s constantly drunk and cooped up in that shit hole all day. He’s most  definitely a neglectful pet owner and that’s probably why his cats keep  dying. They’re malnourished. I’ve been in his house before. It’s  disgusting. Fleas all over the place. You can’t even see the floor. It’s  covered in beer cans. The kitchen is a rotten mess of piled up dishes  and overflowing garbage cans. I think he just forgets to keep his cats  fed, honestly.”

“Well that’s  terrible,” I said. “But I did see a pretty large figure out of my window  last night. It wasn’t a deer. Too big. Maybe there really is something  out there.”

“Perhaps,” Clarence  said, standing up a little wobbly. “Well, I’d better be off. Wouldn’t  want a bear to catch me off guard in this drunken state.”

“Yeah,” I laughed. “Clarence… have you ever seen one of his cats after they died?”

“Of  course,” he answered. “I mean, I really would rather not talk about it,  though. It’s a disturbing thing to see a dead animal.”

“Right,”  I peered off into the corner. “Do they look emaciated when they die,  though? Like they starved to death? Or are they mangled like something  ate them?”

“I’d honestly rather  not talk about dead cats right now. I’m too drunk.” Clarence hobbled to  the front door and turned the knob. When it squeaked open, Lenny bolted  out.

“Holy shit!” I stammered. “My cat!”

“Sorry,” Clarence said, clasping his hands to his face. “I’m so sorry. I’ll help you find him.”

The two of us ran out into the night. “I’ll go toward the cliff. You look by the brookside.”

“You got it,” Clarence said and ran to the brook.

I  searched the cliffside for a thorough fifteen minutes. It was no use.  Lenny wasn’t anywhere around me. I headed back to the brook and called  out for Clarence. At first, I heard no sound. I shouted again. Clarence  walked out of the woodland beyond the brook. His face looked solemn.

“What?” I cried. “Did you find him? Did you find Lenny?”

Clarence nodded. “I’m so sorry, man. I really didn’t mean to let him out.”

“Where is he?”

Clarence  pointed to his left. Lenny’s body lay lifeless in the glade beside him.  His entrails leaked out of his backend. I ran to his side and cried  aloud. “What the fuck? Lenny… no…”

“Maybe there really is something other than deer out in this wood,” Clarence said with a shudder.

“Half  of Lenny’s body is missing!” I yelled. “There’s clearly something  sinister in this wood. What the fuck would do this to a cat?”

“I  hate to admit it, but Kenny has to be right. We are in the mountains.  There are bears in Appalachia. I’ve never seen one, but they are elusive  creatures.” Clarence walked up and put his hand on my shoulder. “I  really am sorry. I had no idea your cat would bolt out of the door like  that. I would never have come over had I known the fate that would  happen tonight.” He slumped his head down and walked off toward his  house. I picked myself up and staggered back inside. It would have been a  sleepless night had it not been for the copious amounts of bourbon I  drank with Clarence.

I woke up to  the sounds of screaming again. I looked at my phone. It was 3 am. I’d  slept for an hour. The scream was close. It couldn’t have been more than  an acre away from my property. I put on my gym shorts and shirt and  grabbed my acoustic guitar. If there really was a bear, I’d need  something to defend myself. I dashed out the door and headed toward the  screaming sound ready to avenge my poor Lenny.

The  sounds of screaming were still active and coming from the direction of  Kenny’s and Clarence’s houses. I sprinted down the dark drive and saw  two figures in the meadow between Kenny’s and Clarence’s properties. It  appeared as if a large brown creature with fuzzy fur was on top of a man  screaming in agony.

“Get out of  here, you bastard bear!” I yelled at the beast, picking up my guitar as  if it were an axe. The creature looked ate me and let out a hideous  growl. “Oh shit,” I said suddenly realizing the danger I was in. It  glared at me and I saw a shadow of liquid drip off the beast’s teeth. It  had to be blood from the man I could only think was Clarence being  viciously attacked by an Appalachian brown bear.

The  creature sprung toward me in a bound. It’s hurtling footsteps dashed  forward. I backed up slowly, eyes widening. It’s broad shoulders moved  violently in the light of the moon and I noticed the texture of its fur.  Where had I seen that fuzzy brown before? Just as I began to remember, I  saw Clarence’s fuzzy, brown robe and slobering jowls right in front of  me. I cocked back my Alvarez and swung right at his face.

My  brand new co-worker, with the Escalade, fell to the cold grass. I stood  up and ran toward whatever creature he had been attacking before I  shouted at him. As I approached, I looked upon a weeping figure in the  shrubs. It was Kenny bent over in the fetal position. He was sporting a  few human sized bites out of his right calf and lower left abdomen.

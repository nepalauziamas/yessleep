**CW/TW: Cronos Syndrome/Fear of being Replaced, Description/implications of blood, Explicit Language**

A dark, and  cold world. 

In fact, it is so dark you can’t even see your hand should it be right in front of your face. 

It is so cold that you could get hypothermia just passing through momentarily. 

It is almost as if you are standing in the veins of a creature long since forgotten; long since exiled from the known world; from our reality.

I sat on my porch step, waiting for my friends, Amera, and Byron so we could walk to school together. Just like everyday. It’s nothing new.

Only this time, the atmosphere felt heavy… thick… extremely, abnormally, humid…

*There they are.* I thought.

“Hey guys!” I yelled, waving aggressively, as we always do to greet each other.

I got up and started walking towards them; but I never reached them. Everything went black; and got super chilly all of a sudden. Windy, too.

“What the hell just happened?” I said aloud, *and why is it so dark?*

I started walking, slowly, still trying to figure out just what’s going on. 

I tripped over something soft, and warm, and… wet? As gross as it may sound, given all the different things that could’ve been, I was happy. It felt nice. Helped my body warm up, even if just a little.

*I feel like something’s watching me…* I thought. 

“Who’s there!?” I yelled

“Wh…o…s the…re” someone spoke back. Or rather, something. There is no way that… thing… was human. It sounded… blank. Devoid. Emotionless. Robotic.

“What the fuck…?”

“What…t..h...e...fu...ck...”

I started running, as fast as I could, in the opposite direction.

I heard footsteps behind me. Whatever it was, had begun following me.

I kept running, until I hit what I hope was water; but it was thick, and warm, and it wreaked of rust, mold, and decay.

I swam for what felt like hours, but I truly have no idea how much time had passed.

I couldn't see anything. For all I knew, I was going in circles.

I couldn’t hear footsteps anymore. Which could mean one of 3 things.

1. I had lost it
2. It had given up
3. It had gotten in the…water…with me

3, is what I was most scared of. It’s what felt like the truth. 

I kept swimming, until I finally made it out of the pool.

I honestly felt like I was losing my mind, in the complete darkness, with whatever this thing is chasing me.

I started counting, in my head, in an attempt to keep track of time. 

*1…2…3…* I heard something far behind me *4…5…6…* It sounded like something was thrashing around in the pool behind me. *7…8…9…* It stopped. *10…11…12…* “Did whatever that was drown?” *13…14…15…*I heard something crack, snap, and pop, behind me. Like a Barbie doll that hasn’t been played with for far too long.*16…17…18…*Or an elderly person getting up in the morning.*19…20…21…*  “Ï guess not…?” *22…23…24…* “Nope… I didn’t” The thing spoke behind me. Only now, it almost sounds human… It sounded VERY uncanny valley… *25…26…27* I started running again. So did the thing… *28…29…30…* It sounded like plastic, Almost like when you see those mannequins come to life on TV.  

*31…32…33…* It started explaining to me what was happening. *34…35…36…* It said it wanted to replace me. *37…38…39…* And that I was in it’s domain. *40…41…42…* It said I would never escape. *43…44…45…* That I’ve already spent too long here. *46…47…48…* That there was just one more thing it needed to do, to finish replacing me. *49…50…51…* Eat me.  

*52…53…54…* I saw a light, way off in the distance. *55…56…57…* I ran towards it, the thing gaining on me.*58…59…60…* The light wasn't getting any closer. In fact, it seemed like it was getting further, and further away from me, as the thing got closer.

It started singing Mad World, by Tears for Fears, but specifically the cover version by Gary Jules. My favourite song… or, I guess it’d be it’s favourite song too…?  

It started getting louder. Closer. Singing faster. I didn’t realise it before, but now I was almost at the light. It was a glowing door. As I went to dive through it, the thing grabbed me. It bit me.

I screamed as loud as I could, and it coiled back momentarily. I leaped out the glowing door, and found myself in bed, waking up to my alarm, before school. *That couldn’t have been a dream… I mean… My arm is bleeding…* I thought to myself. “Ït wasn’t. ”Spoke a voice inside my head. “Now, I’ll really replace you.”

Level: Replaced by Plastic, is a level only accessible through sleeping in the real world. If You don’t manage to escape, you will be replaced by the mannequin. If you escape, but get injured by the mannequin, it will return to the real world with you, making you go insane. If you escape unscathed, it will all just seem like a bad dream. If you wake up before you get caught, or escape, the mannequin will begin chasing you in real life. 

The level is COMPLETELY dark, save for the glowing door, located somewhere within. There are pools of a blood-like substance littered about, all varying in depth.Being in one of these at the same time as the Mannequin, makes replacing you easier. 

The level is -40C on average, except in and around the pools, which can be as warm as 12C.

The more you think, the more it thinks like you.

The more you speak, the more it speaks like you.

The more you move, the more it moves like you.

The more you exist, the more it will become you.

No Bases, or civilization.

Minimal entity count

Class 1-2

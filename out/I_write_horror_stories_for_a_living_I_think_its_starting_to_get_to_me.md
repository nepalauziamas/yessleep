The wind howled, sending bare branches *tap-tap-tapping* across the porch railing. If I squinted, it almost reminded me of long, bony fingers plucking at the strings of a harp. There was something poetic there, something spine-tinglingly beautiful.  

I couldn’t resist. Carefully, so as to avoid waking Marisol, I stretched one arm out to the dresser and slowly pulled my laptop over to me. I settled it on my knees, curling into that hunched position that always made my wife wince, and eased the screen open. 

I cringed at the flash of light. *God, why do screens always seem that much brighter late at night?* I glanced down at Mari to find her still fast asleep- odd, considering how not-subtle my attempts at subtlety were turning out to be. I didn’t question my good fortune, however, and after lowering the brightness I quickly clicked open a new document and began to write.

*A symphony of sound echoes the lifeless streets. The steady drip from the drainpipes sound off a heartless beat, accompanied by the crescendo of cars driving past and the mournful wails of the wind. Together, the orchestra of the night creates a song that transcends ordinary music. A beautiful, eerie chorus occasionally interrupted by the yowling of cats or the shrieks of the intoxicated.* 

*And yet in rare instances, one can hear a moment where the entire symphony pauses, as though taking a breath. And then-*

The awful sound of a glass shattering echoed from the alleyway behind the house. I probably would have ignored it if it hadn’t been for my wife, who bolted out of bed as though she’d been shocked. 

“Mari!” I grabbed her hand quickly. “Shh. Hey. It was just some drunkard out in the alley.” 

Marisol exhaled and slowly lowered herself back down. I pulled her into my lap and she tucked her head under my chin. 

“I’m sorry, mi amor. I’m just a little on edge tonight.”, my wife murmured.

 I rubbed her shoulders. “Hey, it’s ok. Want to talk about it?” 

Mari looked like she was considering it, but stopped and shook her head. “Let’s just go back to sleep.” She plucked my laptop from the bed and placed it back on the bedside table. “Both of us.” 

I decided not to argue with her. Clearly, she was stressed. Working in homicide got to my wife more than she liked to say, and she’d come home today in a dark mood. The least I could do was to not make things worse.

Still, even with my wife snuggled against my chest, her breath slowly fading into a soft snore, I couldn’t seem to drift off. My mind was abuzz with words, darting back and forth across the surface of my consciousness. It was like an addiction, an itch that I needed to scratch. It felt as though my thoughts were forming a mass, one that would burst out of my head in the form of some inky black beast.

A beast made of words. 

*The urge to write.*

That was good, I decided. I would type it out in the morning.\~

\~ “-and I completely forgot what I was going to write,” I complained. My wife, busy petting our Maine Coon, barely even looked up from her phone. 

I crossed my arms. “Forget it then. I may as well be talking to Pintsize.” 

Marisol glanced up hastily. “I’m sorry, darling. I’m just…preoccupied. I got assigned to a fairly major case last night, and it’s sort of weighing on my mind.”

I perked up. “Ooo, are you working that serial murder case that’s been all over the news lately?” 

Mari frowned. “First of all, *alleged* serial murders. We can’t say for sure whether or not the killings are connected yet. And even if I could tell you that they were- *which I can’t* \- you really shouldn’t be so excited about a potential serial killer, mi vida.” 

I shrank back down, duly chastised. “I know, I know. I’m sorry. It’s just so fascinating, you know?” I tried for a playful smile, hoping it would ease some of my wife’s annoyance. “Hey, I’m a writer. I can’t help being fascinated by the macabre.” 

Marisol sighed. “It’s too early in the morning for this conversation. I’m going to work, ok?” She stood, scooping up our cat and depositing him into my lap as she did. “Here you go, Pintsize. Take care of Mommy while Mama is at work, alright?” 

I grinned and stole a quick kiss. “Go save the world, baby. We’ll be here when you get back.”\~

I took my time finishing my oatmeal that morning, Pintsize purring away in my lap as I absently scrolled the NoSleep subreddit. I came across a few interesting stories, such as one where a pair of women left their [cheating boyfriend for eachothe](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/twkakw/cheater_cheater/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\- after shooting him in the back, of course. I bookmarked that one to show to my wife. 

After about half an hour or so, however, I stretched and forced myself to put my phone down. I gently set Pintsize down on the floor and headed to my office- which was actually just one corner of our living room that I had sectioned off with a low desk (complete with scattered papers, pens, and a small fish tank that housed a pretty blue-green betta named Frogspawn), a corner lamp and a plush, fuzzy beanbag chair. Not your typical workspace, for sure, but for a rising author who worked from home? It was heaven.

I curled up in the dent I’d worn down into the beanbag and pulled out my laptop. In a pleasant deviation from my daily routine, I actually had a paid project to work on. A good-sized scifi magazine had reached out to me and offered me a slot in their pride month exhibition if I wrote a modern retelling of the novel ‘Carmilla’, an offer I couldn’t pass up. 

I settled down, taking a moment to stare down the blank google doc facing me like a challenger entering the ring. Then, I started to write. \~

*“That’s…huh. That’s weird.”* 

*Her girlfriend gave me an entrancing smile, one that never failed to turn my knees to jelly. “What’s weird, darling?”*

*Layne blushed involuntarily. “It’s just…well, look. That painting. Doesn’t it look just like-“* 

***Thump.***

I frowned and glanced up. Quickly, I scanned the room, checking to see if whatever Pintsize had just knocked over was broken. Or valuable. Or both.

*Nothing*. 

“Huh.” I wrinkled my nose and went back to work. 

*“Does it really?” Millie cooed, brushing her lover’s chin with her thumb. Layne gazed into golden-brown eyes, feeling herself get lost in those irises that seemed to swirl and twist in the afternoon-*

***THUMP***\*\*.\*\* 

This time, the thud got my full attention. I rolled my eyes and set my laptop aside. *This cat, I swear…*

I strode past the kitchen, poking my head in. *Empty.* Just as I’d suspected, the little troublemaker was in the guest bedroom. 

I went to push the door open as I walked through, and promptly walked smack into the door. “Damn it,” I swore, rubbing my arm indignantly. It had been a little over a year of living in this apartment with my wife and cat, and I still couldn’t remember which doors opened towards the hallway. 

I opened the door and stepped inside, then yelped. “Shit, shit, *shit…*” I muttered, running towards the open window. *How the hell had that gotten opened?*  I stuck my head out and frantically scanned the unforgiving stone of the parking lot below- and nearly fell out the window myself when my cat brushed around my ankles. 

“Pintsize!” I scooped my cat up and kissed his fuzzy head, relieved. He squirmed and mewled indignantly at the treatment. I pulled back and held him out so I could look him in the eyes, a habit I’d picked up from my wife. *That cat is my first child*, she’d say, *and I’ll treat him as such*. “Don’t you know how badly you just scared Mommy? She thought you jumped out the window!” 

“Meow?” 

I sighed and went back to cuddling him. “But you don’t know that, do you?” I nuzzled his belly and the cat chirped. “No, you just don’t know anything. There’s no thoughts in that little head. No thoughts, just- *holy crap!”* 

I nearly dropped Pintsize when a sudden gust of wind blew through the room, slamming the door shut. 

“Oh my god,” I muttered, leaning against the wall. My cat meowed up at me curiously. I rubbed his ears. “I know, baby. That scared Mommy too. Just the wind, though. Just the wind, blowing the door…shut.” 

I froze. 

The door had slammed shut. 

*The door opened outwards.* 

But the gust had definitely come from the window behind me. 

*And the door opened outwards.* 

A wave of fear washed over me. I felt grounded to the spot, as though the door’s slam had driven a nail through my feet. Clutching my cat in my arms, hovering by the open window with the wind still whistling faintly through my hair, my heart pounded in my chest and my mind swirled with thoughts. The monsters I’d written clawed their way to the forefront of my mind, the spirits and demons that had come from the tips of my fingertips darting back and forth in my head, laughing at me. 

I waited for what felt like eons, listening for anything. A thump, a footstep, anything. 

There was nothing. 

Finally, I edged towards the door. I nudged it open with my elbow (I wasn’t willing to forgo the comfort of holding my cat just yet) and peeked into the hallway. 

Empty. 

Slowly, I crept into the kitchen. I fumbled for the knife block, finding the butcher knife missing and settling for the serrated bread knife instead. 

Shakily, I turned and tiptoed around the corner, clutching my cat in one hand and the knife in the other. I poked my head into each room, one by one, scanning the cabinets and curtains and the spaces under beds. First the living room, then the guest room, then the guest bathroom, then Mari’s office. With every room I checked, my heart thumped harder in my throat. 

I made it down the hallway and turned. Staring down the dark path, I felt myself beginning to tremble again. My home suddenly seemed so much more dark, so much more intimidating. *~~Had~~* *I turned the kitchen light off*\*~~?~~\*. *I didn’t remember doing that…*

*Click!*

Something sounded down the hallway. I clutched the cat tighter.

*Thump. Thump. Thump*. 

*Oh god, those were definitely footsteps.* 

*Thump. Thump. Thump*. 

*I’m going to die. Some crazy fantasy monster is going to snatch me up and claw me to bits. My (detective) wife will* *~~never~~*  *find my body when she comes home, and she’ll be destroye-* 

“Ava?” 

The lights came on and I screamed, flailing my knife wildly in the air in front of me.

“Whoa!” my wife exclaimed, jumping away. “Wha- Ava, what on earth are you doing?” 

I gasped in relief and dropped the blade. “Oh my god, I’m so sorry. I…I heard a noise, and then the window was opened, but the door slammed closed and I-” 

My knees gave out and I nearly fell over. Marisol caught me, lowering us both to the ground with Pintsize trapped in between us. “Easy, easy, darling. You’re ok. It’s just me.” 

I laughed and hugged her, still a bit shaky. “I know, I know. I don’t know what got into me.” I nudged the knife with my toe. “Hell, I don’t know what I was gonna do with this anyway. Stab a demon?” 

Marisol snorted. “Demons? I think you’re getting too into your stories, amor. Outside of your laptop, there’s no such thing.” 

She kissed my forehead and helped me up. “Now, come on. I’ll make you pasta carbonara for dinner.” 

I sighed and followed her down the hallway, doing my best not to glance over my shoulder.

It was a few days before Mari left me alone again. She had been lucky enough to get days off in the middle of the week- inconvenient for parents, sure, but for a pair of childless lesbians? Paradise. No lines anywhere. 

During that time, I tried my best not to let my anxiety get to me. Tried, being the operative word. My nerve-addled mind was buzzing with alertness, constantly looking over my shoulder for something, *anything*, to justify my fear. A creak of the floorboards, a thump from the walls, a light I could swear I’d remembered to turn off. *Anything*. 

I knew my wife was right. I knew I was just losing myself in my writing, getting too in my head and scaring myself. And yet I couldn’t help but jump when she snuck up behind me and placed her hands over my eyes. I started using a stick to turn on lights I couldn’t reach before I entered a room, sleeping with the bathroom light on as though it would protect me from whatever was hiding in the dark. 

*It’s not real. There’s nothing hiding around the corner, nothing standing behind the door. That light was always on. That knife was always missing.* ***It’s*** ***~~not~~*** ***real.***

Mari kissed me goodbye that morning (~~for the last time~~) like she always did. I ate my oatmeal like usual, although I decided to scroll through r/entitledparents instead. I petted my cat, set him down on the ground, and headed towards my office like I always did. 

I stopped. 

Alarm bells in my mind were going off, though what they were warning of, I wasn’t sure. 

*Don’t do it. Don’t go sit down. Don’t ignore it.*

*~~I~~* ***She should have listened.***

I curled up in my dent in the beanbag and watched Frogspawn swim around in circles a bit. Finally, I stopped procrastinating and opened my laptop. I started to write. 

*Layne gazed into golden-brown eyes, feeling herself get lost in those irises that seemed to swirl and twist in the afternoon-*

there was a noIse behind me.

*It wasn’t real.*

i froze up, Listening. terrified. 

*It was\*\***~~n’t~~* *real.*

sOmething cold touched my neck. 

*It was real.*

i’m not alone. i’Ve nEver been alone. not reallY.

*~~It~~* *was real.*

*i’m gOing to die. my mUrder will be a Mystery thAt even my cop wife will neveR fInd the answer to.* 

***He*** *was real.*

*I’m* **not** *sorry*. \~

*In today’s news, budding horror writer Ava Rodriguez-Smith was found stabbed to death in her apartment. Ms. Rodriguez-Smith was discovered by her wife, Detective Marisol Rodriguez-Smith, with her laptop open next to her. Authorities have reason to believe that Ms. Smith is the latest victim of the serial murderer known as the Whisperer.* 

*According to the open document, Ms. Smith’s killer appears to have hidden in her home for days, psychologically tormenting her before eventually forcing her to write\* an account of her last days, which he or she left up for her wife to discover. Families of previous victims have recounted similar stories, and it’s been revealed that Detective Rodriguez was recently assigned to the case- thus giving a likely motive.* 

*Detective Rodriguez has asked that her wife’s last story be published in the forums she frequented as a warning to other potential victims. If you have any information that you believe could be relevant, please contact the non-emergency police line. Flowers and donations for Ms. Ava Rodriguez-Smith’s funeral can be sent in to Detective Rodriguez at the police headquarters.* 

*\*Though Detective Rodriguez has confirmed that the majority of the account was written in her wife’s writing style, occasional edits are seen throughout the text. It’s believed that the killer made changes at his or her discretion after killing Ms. Smith.*

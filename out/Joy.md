I was like 12 years old when this happened to me, one day my older brother was found dead, everyone said he committed suicide, even I thought that, but one day all of that changed.

My mom handed me a box of audio recordings left behind from my brother to me. He wrote a message to me, explaining why he is dead and that it could happen to me.

I decided later that night I would listen to the first one, it was called “Log 1”

Log 1: I have been having these nightmares… there is the same shadowy figure every single night, I don’t know what it wants, it just keeps getting a little closer every time, then it happened, it and its friends appeared.. At first I thought it was a dream, but this was completely real. It's like they want me to go insane.

I was confused on what he was talking about, so I just shrugged it off and went to sleep but I seemly had the same dream that he did, this shadowy figure just kept getting a little closer but unlike my brother, I had a pretty good idea of what this thing wanted, It wanted me dead just like my older brother..

I woke up in the middle of the night in a panic, it got too close to me, I decided to listen to “Log 2” after, cause I knew my brother wasn’t just having some nightmare, that shit was real and was fucking terrifying.

Log 2: if you are hearing this then I am most likely dead, little bro, if this happens to you next, I want you to try to survive unlike I could, the adults won’t believe you, please don’t go to our parents, they will just get more aggressive.

I was confused why did the logs changed so much, there isn’t any advice on this one either, so I listened to “Log 3” right after

Log 3: Little bro, I have a good understanding of how to keep these things from killing me, but I don’t know how long I can keep this up. There is one underneath your bed, that one comes up only 2 times a night but its random, all you have to do is to pretend to sleep, pretend until you heard it go back underneath the bed, there is one that will bang on your door about 4 times before it opens the door forcefully, just sit still, it can’t see you if you sit still, that one comes randomly, I don’t know how many times, it was different every night. Ok now for the final one, the one that appears in your dreams before this all happens, the shadowy creature only appears once a night and is more dangerous than the others, for this one you have to not look at it, it won’t attack if you don’t look at it, that's all for now little bro, I hope you survive this unlike I could…

This one had a lot more info, I did everything he told me to do, I lost a lot of sleep because of it, My parents began to notice that I looked so tired that they took me to the hospital, I had no choice but to tell them on what was happening, I told them about the audio logs my brother left me, they wanted to listen to themselves.

After someone listened to the logs, they told me that I was just hallucinating the whole thing because of what my brother was saying, but I knew that this shit was actually happening. The next day, the doctor that listened to the logs had passed last night, this confirmed to me that this was actually happening, but then they told us that, it looked like he committed suicide, I knew he didn’t, those creatures did that to him and made it look like he died because of suicide.

Eventually they left, I don’t know why but they did, maybe they got bored because they couldn’t get to me or they found a different, unsuspecting victim, it's most likely the second one. I hope they can survive just like I did…

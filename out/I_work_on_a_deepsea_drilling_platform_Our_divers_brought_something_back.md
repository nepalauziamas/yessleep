The diver’s lights traced the edges of the aircraft in the ink-black water.  At first glance one might mistake it for a sunken ship.  Plant matter clung to metal ribs sticking out of the sand.  Every inch of fuselage was covered with barnacles.  Propellers bent at odd angles.  The diver passed his light over the shattered canopy, gaping wide like the mouth of a frozen whale.

“What is it?” the voice over the radio asked.  “B-17?  B-29?”

I watched silently through the television screen in my office.  The crew was stationed on a diving rig south of Alaska.  We were safely above the surface, supervising the dive while we sipped hot chocolate.  The room was small and cramped but well-lit.  A trash can overflowed with snack wrappers and soda cans.  The single window revealed dark clouds forming on the horizon.  My partner, Bill, spat tobacco into a Gatorade bottle but said nothing.

Jeff was over a hundred meters below the surface of the water, sending back video of the aircraft resting on the sea floor.  We watched with quiet fascination bordering on reverence.  I was no expert and I couldn’t guess at what type of plane it was.  But we all agreed that it was very old, dating back to World War Two or perhaps the fifties.

“That’s really cool,” I said into the microphone.  “We’ll send down a better camera next time and you can get some pictures.”  Then I glanced at the clock.  “But right now we need to pack it up.”

Jeff’s helmet-mounted camera lingered on the ancient aircraft, then reluctantly turned back to the diving bell.  Each dive happened on a strict schedule, but there would be more opportunities to sightsee the wreckage.  This was a drilling platform, after all.  We weren’t going anywhere soon.

A hundred meters was not particularly deep as far as coastal waters went.  The platform itself could operate in waters four times that depth, and it was equipped for drilling down to six kilometers.  Ninety-eight people on a platform one hundred and eight meters long, pumping one thousand fifteen barrels a day. At the start of the dive we had no idea there was an old airplane sunk to the sea floor directly beneath us.  It was pure chance that Jeff happened upon it.  If we had even been slightly south or west of our position, the water would have been far too deep and we never would have seen it.

“We need to call National Geographic,” Bill said with a grin.

“Maybe,” I replied.  Truth was, I had no idea how or to whom we were supposed to report a seventy-year old airplane crash.  Assuming it wasn’t already known by the authorities.  Assuming anyone cared.  I suspected someone out there did.  “Couple of years ago, I knew a Chaplain who did personnel recovery.  He was part of some organization that would go looking for old plane crashes on mountaintops and stuff.  Like, the really isolated, out-of-the-way places.  Accounting for the remains was a pretty big deal.”

“It would have to be really out of the way if nobody found it since the war.”

“Yeah,” I agreed.  “Like this.”

It was very cool, but it wasn’t the job.  The job was underwater saturation diving welding and maintenance.  Our divers couldn’t just jump off the side of a boat.  This was deep diving.  And I mean deep.

I suppose I should take a moment to explain.

I was a life support tech on the dive mission, monitoring Jeff, and his partner Harry.  These were two of the bravest, craziest, most well-compensated men I had ever met.  Their job was saturation diving, a profession so dangerous that there are only about three hundred people qualified to do it.  As you might expect, it’s a job with high pay, high standards, and few applicants.  Their task was to perform maintenance on the drilling equipment beneath the drilling rig, far beneath the surface of the water.

Diving to this depth creates a problem.  During a dive, the divers take on extra oxygen and nitrogen in their compressed air tanks.  Most of the nitrogen gets absorbed into the body’s tissues.  As you go deeper, the literal weight of the ocean pushes on you from every direction.  This creates pressure so intense that even the oxygen and nitrogen molecules in the body’s tissues get compressed.  Once the body is saturated with gasses, it is impossible for the diver to return to the surface.  The compressed gasses re-expand inside the body, creating bubbles.  This condition is commonly called “the bends.”  You may have heard of it. The symptoms include excruciating pain, confusion, paralysis, and sometimes even death.  It is, reputedly, one of the most painful things a human can experience.

Right now, Jeff was experiencing nine atmospheres of pressure…  Nine times what we are accustomed to on the surface.  Imagine you inflated a rubber balloon until it was completely full, and then kept adding more.  What do you think happens to a balloon over-inflated with nine times too much air?  Yeah.  It’s not cool.

To combat this condition, the diver must return to the surface slowly and allow their body enough time to match the surface pressure.  And I do mean slowly.  Very slowly.  At one hundred meters depth, the diver will require fifty hours to return to normal pressure.  This, of course, is completely impractical.  Our solution to this was the pressurized diving bell.  This was an apparatus shaped a bit like a giant soda can.  A steel capsule just big enough to hold two divers and their equipment.  The idea was that the divers would enter the bell and be transferred safely to a pressurized capsule to the surface, where they could take their time de-compressing inside a specialized compression chamber.  Most often they just lived in the chamber for weeks on end, going on repeated dives and de-compressing only when the mission was complete.

I watched Jeff ascend towards the hatch in the bottom of the can.  His partner, Harry, was waiting inside the bell to help him aboard.  He swam up past the ballast weights and into the portal that was barely big enough for his shoulders and air tanks.  The interior was just as cramped and miserable as you’d expect.  The walls were covered with tubes, hoses, and wires of every description.  They had spare tanks of air for the dive and for the bell itself, and of course the variety of tools they needed to do their work.  Pressurized air and power came down through a foot-thick cable umbilical descending from the platform.

Jeff had to crawl up into the lighted chamber, then somehow find room to stand aside while Harry sealed the hatch in the floor.  It looked like a tremendous pain in the ass to climb up with all the diving equipment and avoid getting tangled in the mess of hoses. The hatch opened outwards, as you might expect.  The idea was, during the ascent the can’s internal pressure would be greater than the surrounding water, so it would constantly be pushing the hatch outwards.

Only a tiny window allowed the crew to see what was happening outside the bell.  Not that there was anything to see, given how dark the water was.

Jeff was halfway up the ladder when he suddenly cried out.

“Shit!” he screamed, as he lost his footing and fell downwards.  Harry grabbed him by the harness as Jeff began to kick.  He was screaming, thrashing, and kicking at something in the water.  We had no idea what was happening.  The helmet mounted camera was snapping back and forth, leaving only blurred images of the can’s interior.  Eventually we noticed a change in the water.  As Jeff struggled in the water we saw the splashes were tinted red.

“The fuck?” Bill asked, leaning towards the television.  He keyed the mike and shouted, “Get him out of there!”

I glared at Bill for a moment.  Jackass.  As if Harry wasn’t doing exactly that.  Thanks a lot, Bill.  I’m sure the encouragement made all the difference.

I didn’t say this, but I thought it really loud.

I should be fair to Bill. It was a terrible feeling to be watching from a hundred meters up, completely unable to help in any way, while the man fought and kicked and screamed.  I understood the impulse to want to do something - ANYTHING - no matter how asinine, just to feel as if I was contributing.  But the truth was, they were on their own.

“Is that a shark or something?” Bill asked.

I didn’t respond.  I just stared in terrible fascination as Harry helped Jeff out of the water and slammed the hatch shut.  As the panic settled and the camera shaking slowed, we could see the injury more clearly.  Jeff’s ankle was gushing dark blood.  This is something that amazed me.  Most people get through life without much worse than a cut on their finger, so they underestimate exactly how much a person can bleed.  The water made it look a thousand times worse.  Harry wrapped the limb in a towel and applied pressure.  We couldn’t see Jeff’s face but we could hear his pained grunts as he tried to control himself.  The rag was already turning a dark red.

“Harry,” I said into the mike.  “Harry, listen to me.  I need you to take a look at the wound.  We need to know if it’s arterial.  I want you to look at it and tell me if you see bright red blood.  Or squirting blood.”

“Seriously?” Harry asked.

“Yeah, man.  I need to know.”

“He can’t put a tourniquet on that,” Bill told me.

“He’ll have to,” I replied.

“But it will take fifty hours…”

“If he can’t stop the bleeding, Jeff needs a tourniquet.  Even if he loses the limb.”

I knew where Bill was coming from.  Judging from the shocked expression on Harry’s face, he understood.  If Jeff needed emergency surgery, there was nothing we could do.  Even if a surgeon was standing right there ready to go, we couldn’t let him leave the compression chamber.  Not unless we wanted him to explode like an over-filled party balloon.

Harry removed the rag just long enough to glance at the wound.  I had expected to see bite marks, like from a small shark or something.  Instead there were two lacerations just above the ankle.  Actually, three.  One of them was smaller than the others.  Almost immediately they began to ooze dark, venous blood.  Harry quickly replaced the rag.

“Keep applying pressure,” I told him.  “We’re bringing you up.”

“He’s going to need stitches,” Bill said.

“Yeah.  Call the surgeon.  And get them on the phone with Gene.  We might need to walk them through this.”

Jeff and Harry were not the only divers on the mission.  We had two other men - Gene and Travis - waiting in the compression capsule on the rig.  They had a basic first aid kit, but we could pass them additional supplies through the airlock if we had to.  I suspected we would need a doctor to video-chat with us and give some instructions.

At this point Harry removed the camera and placed it on the rack so I could see what was happening from a fixed, but stable position.

“Holy shit!” Jeff suddenly screamed.

Harry jumped.  So did Bill and I.  On the monitor we could see the divers were both staring at the porthole.  The seawater outside was going from dark black to a lighter blue as the can ascended.

“Did you see that?” Jeff asked.  “Did you see that?”

Harry shook his head.  Bill and I looked at each other.

“It was a fucking lizard outside.”

“A lizard?” Bill and I whispered to ourselves, in unison.

“I didn’t see it,” Harry said.

“There was a lizard…  something… like a foot long outside the bell.”

“Not at this depth,” I said into the mike.  “It was a fish or something. Stay calm.  Everything’s going to be okay.”

I was a filthy rotten liar.

And that was before the shit really hit the fan.

The porthole suddenly cracked.  There was an audible popping sound and the glass actually cracked.  Let’s be clear on this…  We aren’t talking about window glass.  This is multiple layers of bulletproof plexiglass, meant to withstand incredible pressures.  It doesn’t crack and it doesn’t break.  But it did.  Worse, we could see bubbles escaping outside the porthole.

“Oh shit,” I said.

“We’re leaking,” Harry said. He was starting to panic now.  “We’re leaking.”

A leak in an over-pressurized can is a big problem, but not for the reason you might think.  Water wasn’t coming into the can.  It couldn’t.  As the diving bell ascended, the pressure inside the can was so much greater than the pressure outside that it was literally impossible for water to slip in through the cracks.  Instead, they were venting their precious air into the ocean.

That meant they were losing pressure. Decompression sickness would follow next.

“Calm down,” I said into the mike, even though my voice was in no way calm.  “Harry, make Jeff hold the wound.  I need you to open all the emergency valves.”  The indicators on my computer started to spike.  “All of them.  Bill, increase pressure from the pump.”

There was only one way they were making it out of this.  They had to replenish the air inside the can faster than it was depleted, to prevent the bends from kicking in.  Harry did as instructed, twisting the knobs on the emergency air tanks.  The diving bell carried enough spare air that it could, theoretically, survive even if the surface pump failed.  As the bell rose, the pressure difference would get worse, and more air would escape the bell.

Bill manipulated the switches, first increasing airflow from the compressor down the umbilical, and then accelerating the winch.  For a few minutes all we could do was sit and wait.  I stared helplessly at the screen as Jeff gripped his wounded leg and Harry opened the emergency reserves on their personal tanks.

“They’re coming up,” Bill finally said.  He abandoned the office at that point, letting in a blast of cold wind as he threw open the door.

“Walkie talkie,” I reminded him.  Bill turned around just long enough to grab the handheld radio off the table.

I reached over the controls, turned on the spare monitor, then cycled the cameras until I had an exterior view of the compression chamber.  This was an ugly lime green tube that we sometimes joked was a ‘reverse submarine.’  It sure looked a lot like a submarine on the inside.  The cylindrical living space was so cramped that the occupants were nearly shoulder to shoulder.  They slept in four small bunks, and had just enough room for a card table and a latrine.  Some models had multiple chambers, almost like you’d imagine a habitat built on another planet.  And the purpose was essentially the same:  To keep the crew in a self-contained atmosphere separate from our own.

At this point Bill and the tenders were moving the diving bell out of the water and into position.  By zooming in the camera I could see the damage to the exterior.  Some of the bolts surrounding the porthole had been sheared clean off.  The glass wasn’t just cracked.  The entire window was coming loose from the frame.  That was bad.  Very bad.

“Come on,” I said, watching the crane move the can into position.  “Come on.”

Glancing back to the first camera, Jeff and Harry were in bad shape.  Jeff was bent over at the waist, trying to maintain pressure on his wounded leg.  Harry was attempting to hold a plastic bag against the cracked window in an effort to stem the pressure loss.  Both of them were pale and dizzy.  I could only imagine the kind of pain they were in.  The bends were getting them, now.  Cramps in every part of the body.  Bubbles in the blood.  It was torture.

“Got it,” Bill said, over the radio.

The can was now mated with the capsule’s airlock.  I watched the cameras as the interior hatch flung open, and the two divers met with instant relief.  The moment they returned to the full nine atmospheres, and took a few deep breaths, the gasses re-saturated and their bodies re-compressed.

Harry had to help Jeff into the airlock.  This was not terribly difficult, despite the tight confines.  I watched them both make their way through the hatch.  The camera lingered on the empty space.  The floor of the can was drenched in bloody seawater.  Jeff left a trail behind him as he moved.  Splatters of darker, undiluted blood marked the floor around the hatch.  They had both left bloody handprints on the walls.  It was terrible.  The airlock hatch closed.  The seal was complete.  They had escaped the damaged diving bell and were now safe.

I exhaled and let myself fall back in my chair.  I had not realized how tightly I had been clenching my jaw until I finally let it relax.

“Are we good?” I asked into the radio.

“We’re good,” Bill said.  He turned and gave a thumbs-up to the camera he knew I would be watching from.  I could see our other two divers, Gene and Travis, through the capsule’s porthole.  Once they were sure the outer airlock was sealed, they opened the inner hatch.  No time for handshakes.  They quickly began helping Jeff into the inner chamber.

Dammit.  The doc.  I shot upright in my chair.  I had told Bill to call the surgeon, but he had gotten distracted by the recovery.  At that point I reached across the desk to grab the phone.  And that’s when I saw it.  I froze.

There was something crawling on the exterior of the can.  It did resemble a lizard, but only insofar as it had scaly green skin and clawed feet.  I’d say it looked more like an abhorrent mix of a crocodile, a chimpanzee, and a bat.  The thing clawed its way up the side of the can with over-long arms and disproportionately small legs.  Its eyes were vast saucers.  Erect, pointed ears sprouted from its skull.  I did not see a nose, if it even had one, but the face was a leering grin full of jagged teeth.  It was… I don’t know…  “Goblin” was the best word I could come up with.

Then it clicked in my head.  Not a goblin.  A gremlin.  An urban legend among pilots, a mischievous little shit that lived on airplanes and caused them to break.  I thought about the bomber on the sea floor.  Had it been living down there?  In the sunken plane?  Since World War Two?

Oh.  My.  God.

This realization struck me in a flash.  I immediately snatched up the radio and began screaming.

“It’s on the outside!  It’s on top of the can!”

Bill was saying something on the camera, but in my panic I was holding down the key and couldn’t receive whatever he was transmitting.  I just continued to shout as I watched the creature crawl its way across the top of the can and onto the airlock portal.

“Look up!  Look up!  It’s on the airlock!  You have to stop it.  Bill!  Look up!”

He turned awkwardly, glancing around, trying to spot whatever the hell it was I was talking about.  At the last possible instant he saw the gremlin.  It was picking the nuts off the airlock hatch with its bare hands.  It was almost effortless.  Bill was caught in a moment of paralyzing shock.  He dropped the radio and clutched his scalp.  Even through the walls I could hear him scream, “NO!”

I will never un-see what happened next.

The airlock hatch cracked open fractionally as the bolts and weld failed.  The result was instantaneous and explosive.  Nine atmospheres of pressure attempted to escape the breach in the space of a second.  The four men moving through the airlock exploded.  They literally exploded.  Every tissue in their body swelled, bubbled, and boiled. Their skin burst open like over-heated sausages.  I couldn’t see any of this, of course.  I could only see the result as the over-pressurized shell vented their bodies through an opening that was far too small to fit.  Their bones were shattered.  Their limbs were sheared off.  I saw an explosion of human meat escaping the fissure in the steel.

Bill was thrown backwards by the explosion.  He was physically blown off his feet, limbs flailing limply, helplessly as he spun in mid-air.  The blast carried him into a railing, probably crushing his spine, and then he fell backwards overboard and down to the cold water below.

The rest of us were left in a state of shock.  For a long time all I could do was stare at the carnage.  The other tenders were picking themselves up off the deck.  One by one they checked themselves, gathered their wits, and then froze when they saw the wreckage.  The airlock hatch was split half-open.  The gap was now maybe four inches wide.  Emerging from this gap was a wedge-shaped splatter of blood and human body parts.  I imagined the pattern a spray can would make, if you agitated a giant can full of human paste.

I won’t go into the rest.  Our divers are all dead.  Some of the tenders are hurt.  Bill was fished out of the water.  Also dead.  Rescue helicopters arrived promptly, but they had little to offer.  Now I’m watching gagging men swab blood off the deck and pick up splattered human remains to seal in plastic bags.

And the thing.  The gremlin.  I forwarded the video to my bosses and the Coast Guard.  I don’t know what, if anything, they’ll do about it.

I’ve been staring at the screens for days now.  Barely sleeping.  Barely eating.  Just watching.  Waiting for a glimpse of its lizard scale hide or over-wide eyes.  Because I know it’s on the rig.  One hundred and eight meters of ultra-deepwater, dynamically positioned, semi-submersible offshore drilling machinery. Untold miles of pipes, screws, valves, wires, pumps, and a million other things for it to fuck with.  Ninety-eight souls on board.  Less five, now.

And oil.  Oh Jesus… The oil.

We drill one thousand fifteen barrels per day.  When the Deepwater Horizon exploded, it left behind a hole that bled that much oil *every twenty minutes*.  

What is this little fuck going to do when he figures that out?

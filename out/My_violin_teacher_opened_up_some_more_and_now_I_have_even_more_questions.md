[PART 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wemte8/my_violin_teacher_just_told_me_a_horrifying_story/)

&#x200B;

I didn’t really expect to receive such an outpouring of advice and concern and empathy when I made my first post here last week. I was afraid to reach out to Therese before because, to be completely transparent with you all, I wasn’t even sure what questions to ask. However, my resolve was bolstered by just how many of you are looking for answers in this, the same way that I am.

As you can tell from my previous recounting of Therese’s story, her ability to make music doesn’t stop with her ethereal prowess over an instrument. She’d woven that horrible, *true* tale with as much skill as any composer, and if you were to expect anything less when I finally managed to sit down with her again, you’d find yourself disappointed.

I reached out to Therese via email 5 days ago, and we met last afternoon. I’ve enclosed our correspondence below. The details of our meeting follow, and I am grateful to anyone who takes the time to view either, or perhaps both, since I am anxious to meet with her again to learn more, but our conflicting schedules mean I must wait another week. In the meantime, I'm at a loss for how to compile any of my spinning thoughts into coherent questions and would certainly appreciate any help.

Hi Therese,

I hope this email finds you well, I apologize for my delay with reaching out to book my next session with you. I’m ashamed to admit that I’ve been distracted since our last meeting, and my skills have suffered as a result. I’ve noticed the cadences in particular compositions I know well are a bit… off. Would you be willing to schedule me in for next week?

Additionally, and I apologize if this is too forward but, I would be honored and grateful if you’d indulge my curiosity regarding Viola. Her fate, her relation to you, and so many other questions have burned in my mind since learning of her, and my heart feels like it’s breaking. Again I apologize for my forwardness, I know that this is a subject that causes you pain to relive.

Take Care,

Wren

Hello Wren,

We can most certainly book for next week. I have a two hour opening on Thursday beginning at noon, and am willing to dedicate the first hour to polishing your cadences.

I feel as though I owe you some clarity regarding Viola, and as such I will dedicate that second hour I have free to answer any questions you may have.

Please work on your scales for a MINIMUM of 1 hour each day prior to our session, I would like to get started on 24 Caprices.

Best,

Therese

While my heart sank at the prospect of beginning the arduous journey to master one of the most difficult solo violin pieces ever made, I felt relief still. I would have answers, and not only that, I had 4 days to formulate some questions for her.

As it happens, the answer to my first question actually answered a few of my others. The reason for this is that Therese has this intriguing habit of answering questions with a story. This is honestly something I wish people would do less, typically. No one wants to hear someone ramble on about something that has a simple answer. Therese will always be an exception to that rule and you’re about to see why.

When we finished that hour violin session, Therese wasted no time getting right down to business making a pot of jasmine tea. I could tell by the nervous flutter of her hands as she filled the kettle that she was apprehensive of what questions I might pose. I sat on the chaise lounge in her study, and she took the wingback armchair across from me. As her lightly trembling fingers held out a steaming mug of tea towards me, she wordlessly nodded her assent to begin.

I took a somewhat shaky breath, and asked the question that had been on the forefront of my mind for days.

“Are you Viola’s mother?”

Therese’s eyes partly closed in recognition, she had seen this question coming and was prepared to answer in length, in a way that only she could.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*“I knew I’d made the right decision when I chose to share this with you, and to take you on as a student. You’re bright as the stars, Wren.*

*Yes, Viola was my daughter. I believe I may be able to guess some of the questions that might follow the one you just asked, so allow me to give you some much needed clarity, child.*

*Viola was loved beyond measure by myself and Georg, although as you’re now aware, his love for her was not for the brilliant mind nestled under ebony tresses and eyes of endless blue. His love was for the bones beneath her milky skin, her frantic screams painted with agony, her tears and blood as they dripped to the floor of his workshop. She never cried for help, never begged or pleaded for her life, because she’d seen the joy that had brought him previously. He’d taken the life of a brother she never knew she had, and she’d seen and felt the torment as if it was her own when she held what was left of his broken body in her hands.*

*I see that look you just gave, and yes, your thinking is correct, Wren. I only knew of my children’s suffering, both Viola and… And Morendo. Morendo is a term in musical theory that roughly translates to “die away”. Georg chose it and that painful irony is not lost on me… I almost think it was intentional looking back.*

*Viola’s peril I saw, and felt, with astounding clarity the moment my hands held the smooth intricately carved form of my daughter’s remains. I then witnessed and experienced, through her eyes, what my beloved Morendo went through. That is what truly broke me, to be perfectly frank. Viola’s pain was so intricately woven throughout his in those moments, that I felt anguish tenfold those mere seconds I was forced to bear witness to Georg’s atrocities. Those seconds stretched on for hours in my mind. I felt two short lifetimes burn out in a blink that lasted an eternity.”*

Therese, who had been reclined still gripping her now-cold tea, rose gracefully to her feet, placing the cup on a nearby table, and began to pace somewhat anxiously.

“It occurred to me after we talked at your last session that you might think me a monster. After all, what mother could be so ignorant that she never noticed her children being slowly and carefully prepared for their heinous transformation?”

This last sentence was one Therese spat with a bitterness that tore at my soul. Tears were gathering in the corner of her eyes, eyes whose gaze had remained faraway while she spoke, but met mine now with a burning intensity.

“Wren, none of this is simple, I recognize how much this must be for you to take in. But I couldn’t continue to pass on what I believe to be Viola’s gift to me, to *us*, if you have even a fraction of a notion that I had any prior knowledge of her death. You *must* understand that until my husband placed the instrument her soul inhabits into my hands, I knew nothing of my sweet children and what had become of them I…. *couldn’t* know.”

She gripped my hands in hers then, shaking them lightly to communicate the urgency of her plea. I was still wordlessly processing the information I’d been given, and instead of answers, I felt I had yet more questions to ask. But what my mind ached to know, my mouth could not at that moment bring into existence for Therese. It still can't. All I could do in that moment was firmly squeeze her strong, slender hands and nod numbly as tears threatened to escape my own eyes. I knew that something horrible must have kept her from ever knowing the fate of her daughter.

I didn’t have to ask what that was, because as her hands dropped from mine, they reached for her violin as if drawing strength or comfort from it. Her eyes met mine again, and I could tell that while she was hesitant about whether her next words should even be said, she was resolved to speak them.

“The painting in that home was a lie. I never held my daughter. I never knew my son.”

She drew another shaky breath and again seemed to hesitate briefly.

“You see, I was a prisoner too.”

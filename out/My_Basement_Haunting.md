Yes, this is 100% true, although it may be hard to believe. All of my experiences have happened when I was alone or while the rest of my family was asleep.

I apologize in advance for how long this post is going to be. 
     
It all started about a year ago, I had come back from a trip in Kentucky and my Echo Dot was missing. I brought it up to my family and no one had seen or touched it, but offered to help me look for it. We tore the whole house apart and checked every nook and cranny for it, but could never find it. I finally decided to let it go. Well, until one night, at least. 
     
My mother asked if I could go down to her desk in the basement and grab her charger as she had been working from home at the time. I agree and go down to the basement to retrieve it, and I get a feeling of a male presence and thought it was my stepfather coming down to the basement (for reference all of this happened in about 1 minute). I had my back turned towards the doorway so I could not see who was behind me. I felt very scared and before I had a chance to think I screamed “GET OUT!!” No sooner had I yelled that, I felt a cold gust of wind go behind me and it whispered something that I couldn’t make out in my ear. There was a door behind me that is very noisy when you open and close it and beside me was a solid wall. 
     
At this point I was absolutely terrified because whatever had just done that did NOT like me and did NOT want me down there. I quickly left the basement and tried not to think about it too much. 
     
Little did I know, that was only the beginning of the personal hell this thing put me through. It started out small with things like footsteps above my head (my room was also in the basement), things being knocked over, things out of place, etc.
     
Then, something else went missing. It was small, something I wouldn’t notice easily, my jewelry. I kept all of my jewelry for my piercings in a small box and when I went to go change my piercings I noticed that it was missing. Just like with the Alexa, I asked if anyone had seen it and searched the house with my family completely and it never turned up. I also had $100 plus the cup that the money was in come up missing as well. Again, we searched for it to no avail. 
    
I started seeing this figure by this point, usually it was just out of the corner of my eye. I knew it was very tall, menacing, and did not want me there. I knew when it was around because it had an angry, almost hateful energy. 
     
One early morning I saw it fully at about 3am. I woke up out of a dead sleep to see it against my wall watching me sleep. He was right by my main doorway and the second door (the noisy one mentioned earlier) was behind my bed and I would’ve had to have turned away from it to get to the door. I knew it was not sleep paralysis as I could completely move and speak. My only option was to turn away from it and face my wall. 
     
This must’ve mad it especially mad, because I returned home after visiting my girlfriend and started to clean up the kitchen. I had placed everything from the island onto the stove just so that I was able to clean the island off. I started hearing plastic cracking and turned around to see the stove turned on and immediately turned it off and realized there was no possible way I could’ve accidentally turned it on as you have to physically push the knob in and turn it for the stove to turn on and I hadn’t even placed anything near the stove knobs, everything I placed on the stove was about 5-6 inches away from the knobs. 
     
That was my breaking point, I was tired of this and couldn’t stand it anymore. I yelled out to it and said “you are not welcome here, this is my home and you are not allowed to try to harm me. You need to leave.” If it was mad before, I didn’t help any, it had made its way downstairs and started banging on my basement ceiling, which is also the upstairs floor, and then stopped abruptly. I attempted to go downstairs but I got a very heavy, unwelcome feeling and decided to wait upstairs until someone else came home. 
     
I explained my concern to my parents, but it didn’t feel like they actually listened and didn’t allow me to do anything about it. 
     
I stopped letting the fear control me, and it only got worse. I came upstairs one night at about 1-2 am to get a snack,  and about halfway through I hear a loud guttural growl come from my pitch black living room. The cats immediately left the living room and came beside me because they were terrified and wouldn’t stop looking into the dark living room. I decided to leave the lights off and mind my own business while I finished my snack because I was not about to argue with this thing and try to get it to leave while the rest of my family was asleep. 
     
I didn’t let that experience ruin my midnight snacks, so I went up again another night and something stopped me in my tracks as I turned the corner. It looked like someone was sleeping or sitting in the chair and rocking. At first I thought it was my brother, as it wasn’t uncommon for him to come down to the living room and sleep when he got scared in his room. But, when I turned on the light, the chair was rocking and there was no one there. Again, when I looked down after turning the lights on, the cats were next to me just as terrified as last time. 
     
I got out of that basement as soon as possible, and now live with my girlfriend and haven’t had anymore experiences like that. What could this being have been?

 

The year was 2000, just at the peak of kids TV programming where you had TV networks such as Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. It would also be during this time that a relatively new show would be announced, promo and all at 6pm. The Etiquettes it was called. It was a show that was to teach young children proper manners and etiquette to behave well in society and there were three characters. There was Bamzee, Hoozie, and Gras. It aired on a relatively unknown station in several small towns within America and was poorly animated, like a crappy flash animation. 

Bamzee the main character was reported to be a rebel and a kid who does not follow the rules and was the only human character on the TV promo showcasing the series. Hoozie was the scaredy cat of the trio and preferred to conform to societal norms and often tried to undo the actions of Bamzee. Hoozie was a non-human character who looked like a very poorly drawn image of Barney the Dinosaur. The third character, Gras was also a non-human character that was the mediator between the two and would try to reason with them but fail miserably. He looked the same as Hoozie except he was a blue color instead of pinkish purple. The TV promo went through all of this, showcasing the plots and three characters with a man standing in a hand drawn classroom with a blackboard in the back and some desks. Again the classroom also looked poorly drawn, and it was very clear that this show had a very low budget. 

The man stood there proud and tall, a wide beaming smile upon his face, wearing a suit and tie, he would explain everything about this pilot and define what the word pilot meant to kids for a TV series. That's.. Where things apparently went horribly wrong. It was reported by an anonymous watcher that the screen would glitch and move around before he then saw the man who stood there with a grim face, No music played, or sound, just pure silence. 

The classroom still looked the same but with some changes. For one thing the classroom was noticeably drawn even worse than before and  appeared to be darker and less saturated in color. The man, standing there in the middle of the screen with his grim face, walks slowly up to the camera. 

He doesn't say anything other than stare, simply fixating upon the screen. He cocks his head slowly on his side and pulls something off screen and shows it to the camera, but before being shown what exactly he had in his hand the screen goes black for a few seconds and then reveals him again only this time  his mouth was  wide unnaturally wide, his eyes opened way too wide as well. The sound that could be heard at this point was soft whimpering, and giggling. It was like his jaw was broken, his mouth just stretched endlessly down. 

The screen then glitches and fades to the episode showing the three characters in front of a cave, with Hoozie discussing what to do if one person gets in trouble. They dismiss him as being a scaredy cat and too chicken to be with them and so they go into the cave without him. The screen cuts back to Hoozie as he is mad at them and almost crying.  Again the screen glitches and cuts to a series of flashing images depicting the characters either smiling in an uncanny animated way, or ripping their stomachs open to reveal their innards from within. These graphic images keep being shown endlessly, endlessly cutting back and forth between worse and worse images. One image would show a cliff with the words “can you jump with me?” flashing on the screen. 

Another image would be even more gruesome, showing a young child with his bones broken. Then the screen cuts immediately back to the classroom again. The classroom is nothing but a scribble at this point but still has the features of one however the tables, and chairs are flipped upside down. The colors are suddenly too bright and saturated, as the man is standing in front of the camera again but this time the man is standing there screaming, screaming at the top of his lungs, and in the background was the blood curdling screams of children. At first it would sound faded and distant but then soon enough it would become deafening along with the man's screaming. 

The screen then flashes several more images this time, from a random to a cabin in the woods, to a basement. The next image would show a child sitting in a chair in a very dark room. The room, although very dark, could still form to certain shapes like the heater, or furniture in there and as the camera zooms up to them, their jaw is unhinged and hanging very low to the ground, their eyes pure black with blood oozing out both their mouth and eyes. The screen turns to static shortly after. Not long later after the TV promo aired kids would be screaming at the top of their lungs for seemingly no reason at all, concerning parents greatly. Shortly after this event they would die in their sleep, the causes being unknown. 

The only connected thing that anyone could bring up was the TV promo that was to promote this new animated series. The man in the promo is unknown as well and I'm still frankly trying my absolute hardest to find out more about him. As of making this post I have arranged an interview with the anonymous reporter who survived. Apparently his little brother and him were very close and would often watch cartoons with each other and so they saw the episode, the next day his brother died. 

What's strange about this is that the deaths seem to be with children under the age of 12 which would explain why the anonymous reporter didn't die because he was 13 years old at the time. While I am still trying to put the pieces together I am very lost, but I will update you guys later on this matter. 

Bye guys

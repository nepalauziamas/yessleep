All night I sat in that armchair, the mangy cat curled up in my lap. Every time I closed my eyes, [Ms. Flanigan’s silver ones](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vov2ld/somewhere_outside_dublin_theres_a_retirement_home/) flashed through my mind.

Well, come sundown, I’d be seeing those horrible eyes again…

First thing in the morning, Neck acne pummelled the front door and gave me a list of tasks. I strapped on my toolbelt, filled a duffle bag with drills and screwdrivers, and went from house to house crossing off items like leaky taps and squeaky hinges, really dragging out every job, delaying my inevitable return to Ms. Flanigan’s office. The whole time I acted like a stage hypnotist had placed me under a trance so that Neck acne wouldn’t get suspicious.

In those marches between homes, the cat watched from across the street or halfway up trees. Was it my imagination, or did the little critter actually look concerned?

In one house, a short lady with bottleneck glasses sat quietly listening to a radio tuned to a ‘golden oldies’ station. And wouldn’t you know it, Rocketman by Elton John came on right as I finished realigning her crooked picture frame.

That song was playing the day Mary and I first met. While taking a break from remodelling a kitchen, I popped into a bakery for a quick scone. A lady behind the counter stood with her back to me. She reached over and turned up the volume on a nearby radio.

“Ugh. Don’t you just love Elton?” she asked as she turned around, really feeling the music. Even in a flimsy apron and cheap hairnet, she was the most gorgeous creature on planet earth.

Without the slightest idea who 'Elton' was, I said, “He’s the best!”

After six weeks of visiting that bakery almost every day—long after I’d finished the kitchen and ‘stopping by for a quick scone’ meant a twenty-minute drive out of my way—I finally plucked up the courage to ask her to dinner.

“What took you so bloody long?” was the response.

By mid-afternoon, half the repairs were checked off. In a weird way, it felt nice to be useful again, despite the circumstances.

In the main building, nurses spoon-fed residents cream pudding and mushy vegetables as I flittered between rooms tightening sink pipes, replacing bulbs, and refastening a ceiling fan that had come away from the plaster.

With only a half-hour until sundown, there was only one task left on my list: Ms. Flanigan’s wonky table.

I followed Neck acne into the little office where, before I could unpack my tools, Prisha came to confer with him privately.

He said to me, “Fix that table then stay put. I’ll be back before dusk. Got it?”

“Yes sir.”

Finally, he’d given me some breathing space. This was my chance, but where could I go? Orderlies patrolled the entire village, not to mention that bloody gate.

There had to be a phone somewhere. If I got my hands on some evidence these people were all deranged cultists, the police might not dismiss me as a crackpot. Again.

My eyes scanned the room. In the filing cabinets, there was nothing but medical charts and case notes. The desk was mostly stuffed with Redburn flyers and admin paperwork.

The heavy door in the corner wouldn't open, although that posed little challenge to my combi multipurpose drill.

And Angela said I didn’t need it…

The loud screams of the divots made me cringe, terrified an orderly might hear the racket and spoil my plan. Luckily, the sound went unnoticed.

I lifted the handle away, took a deep breath, pushed open the door, and then stepped into a thick darkness.

The only light coming from my XHP50 torch. A cold draught seeped into my old bones as searched the room. It was completely bare, except for a large, wooden box propped up against the far wall. An expert craftsman must have craved the thing—my fingers glided smoothly across the top. Only when I leaned forward and studied the object up close did it become clear what I had actually touched...

A casket.

My knees began to rattle. Why the hell would the Redburn staff keep that next to Ms. Flannigan’s office? Had they picked it out for me?

As I reeled my hand away, my fingers must have nudged a latch, because all of a sudden, the lid shivered open several inches.

Four sharp fingers reached out of the narrow gap. “Who’s there?” called a groggy voice from within, like someone who’d been shaken awake.

As the lid swung open with a horrible *creeeeeee*, I had to bite my bottom lip, otherwise, I might have shrieked like Angela did when she was six and thought there were monsters hiding inside her closet.

Ms. Flanigan pulled herself out of the casket. Except, she looked…*different*. She had a shrunken face, stretched taut over a well-defined skull. And nails like a fan of knives capping her bony hands.

“Who’s there?” she said, her voice carrying deep into the room. And as she spoke, I glimpsed a mouth stuffed with curved fangs, whiter than porcelain.

Before there was even time to gather my thoughts, her eyes—those dazzling, silver eyes—opened wide.

“You,” she snarled.

Spinning away, I made a desperate break for the door. Ms. Flanigan flew forward, collided with my back, and sent us both careening forward into the adjacent room, where her body flinched and spasmed.

We’d landed square in the middle of a square of light, thrown across the floor by the window on our left-hand side. Smoke billowed from Ms. Flanigan’s hands as she shielded the charred half of her face, before recoiling into the shadow of the other room.

Still gasping for air, I crawled over to the table and hoisted myself up.

Flesh bubbled and burst across Ms. Flanigan’s wrists and palms, but not for long. Within seconds, as if by magic,  her wounds healed themselves up.

“Mr. Donnelly,” she said sharply. “Come here.”

My muscles locked up, briefly. Now looking like her former, human self, she beckoned me toward her with a single, bony finger.

Instead, I scrambled toward the door, snatching my tool bag along the way.

She repeated the commands, more forcefully each time, but whatever spell she’d cast before had already been broken. Those sharp edges in her voice couldn’t touch me.

“I’m going to tear open your throat and drink your insides,” she screamed. That sentence chased me into the auditorium, where I slammed the door shut and paused to catch a breather.

Okay. Ms. Flanigan was a vampire. That meant vampires existed. And I was trapped inside an unescapable fortress with one.

Things started making sense: the residents weren’t in a cult—they were puppets. The plate in my skull gave me some degree of immunity to her hypnotism, so she’d decided to bump me off.

But how did any this help? Even if there was a way to contact the outside world, nobody would ever believe me.

Neck acne came through the door on the opposite side of the room. “What’s all that racket?” he shouted. Then, “You were supposed to wait for me. Get back in there.”

With that *thing*? Not. A. Fecking. Chance.

Neck acne had a good six inches on me, and me a good forty years on him. Still, I couldn’t let him offer me up like an appetizer.

Hands quivering, I fumbled through my toolbelt as he came forward.

When there were only a few metres between me and the lanky bastard, I held up a cannister of WD40 and sprayed it into his sunken eyes. Immediately he gave a shrill squeal and dropped to his knees, hands pressed tight against his leaky eyes.

I hurried out into the corridor before he had a chance to recover.

Casually strolling past orderlies and nurses so as not to make them suspicious, I made my way through the maze of halls. Two bends later, I happened across Potato face, who said, “Weren’t you…supposed to wait…in Ms. Flanigan’s office?

“Change of plans,” I replied, my voice all nervous. “The boiler in the basement needs repaired.”

“Hmm. Let me…check that…with—”

From my belt I grabbed a rubber mallet and swung it in a fierce, downward arc. As it collided with nothing but groin, a sound escaped the man’s mouth like a chipmunk huffing helium. He keeled forward with a faint whimper.

Just a few steps from the front entrance, a two-note alarm began to blare. *Eeeee-eee-eee*. Receptionists went into a frenzied panic while I continued outside at a brisk pace.

Above my head, the sky fumed with orange and red clouds. Vampires could come out after sundown, but there was nothing stopping the Redburn staff from coming after me. Given my advancing age, I needed a head start.

I grabbed a hammer from my bag and tapped a nail into the frame, pinning the door shut. Now they’d have to go all the way around back.

What next? They patrolled the front gate and I’d break my neck climbing the fence.

Seeing no other choice, I hurried home.

Halfway down the street, the cat blitzed out from behind a willow tree and followed me along, meowing non-stop as he followed me into my house.

The sun had already half-dipped beneath the horizon, but never mind Ms. Dracula: those damn orderlies had a spare key in case of emergencies.

With the speed and vigor of a man half my age, I disassembled the kitchen furniture, harvested wooden boards, and haphazardly nailed them across all the doors and ground floor windows.

Before sealing the final one in the lounge, I glanced down at my furry companion. “Troubles on the way, little fella. Last chance to make a break for it.”

He gave me a blank stare. “Suit yourself.”

Taking advantage of those last few minutes of daylight, I wrote Angela a note. Would she ever read it? Probably not. Still, there were some things that needed said.

*Darling, always know that I love you. I’m so proud of you and the kids. You’ve got all the best qualities of me and your mother. Don’t be sad, because now I’m with her again.*

*Love, Dad.*

Outside, the sun finally slipped beneath the horizon. Either Ms. Flanigan or her band of merry men would arrive any second now.

Altogether, every light fixture in the house went out. I peeked through the narrow gap between two boards and saw orderlies and nurses positioned along the street, arms by their sides. Neck acne and Potato face stood just beyond the hedge.

Why hadn’t they tried breaking in yet?

Five seconds later, a silhouette passed above their heads, draping the group in a huge shadow. A moment later, glass shattered somewhere upstairs.

By my feet, the cat’s hair stood on end as though receiving an electrical shock. I think he regretted not making a hasty escape when he had the chance. I scooped him into my arms.

Upstairs, floorboards creaked and groaned as something travelled through the bedroom into the hall. The ceiling seemed to breathe, creaking like my old joints. Outside, the Redburn staff closed in on the house, chanting in perfect unison.  *Here at Redburn village, we work hard to ensure all residents enjoy their retirement in a relaxed, peaceful environment.*

Teeth chattering, I slowly shuffled into the hall and stood at the foot of the stairs. In my arms, the cat trembled fiercely, forcing me to continually readjust my grip.

*Our assisted living facilities enable you to enjoy maximum independence, but with a safety net of highly skilled nurses available 24-hours a day, offering you and your loved ones complete peace of mind.*

A long, twisted shadow engulfed the upstairs landing. Were those…wings? My feet became blocks of cement as the shadow morphed, gradually becoming more human, then Ms. Flanigan appeared and said, “Tsk, tsk, tsk, Mr. Donnelly. Whatever are we gonna do with you?”

Her eyes flicked toward my hands. “And look, you’ve got vermin with you. I could have sworn I disposed of that fleabag months ago.”

That sent the furball into overdrive; after wrestling free of my grip, he bolted down the hall into the kitchen.

Really taking her time with every step, Ms. Flanigan let her fingers scrape across the wall, etching in deep marks.

“What the hell’s going on?” I shouted. “What is this place?”

She chuckled. “This is Redburn, the greatest retirement home in Ireland. Ask any of our residents.”

At the raise of her hands, the chants grew louder.  *It’s a glorious place to wake up each morning. Cozy. Friendly. Warm.*  *It’s a glorious place to wake up each morning. Cozy. Friendly. Warm.*

“So you go around hypnotising the elderly to do your bidding? Is that it? Or are you raising some sort of demon clan?”

She threw her head back and cackled. “Please. I simply need to feed.”

“…Feed?”

Halfway down the steps, she paused. “I’ve been alive for thousands of years, Mr. Donnelly. For centuries I travelled Eastern Europe feeding on peasants, but you humans are a suspicious bunch. Always running me out of your towns and villages sooner or later. Even in the big cities, there was only so long I could last before the ground shrunk beneath my feet. So I had an idea: a retirement home. People die in those all the time. Rather than feed on humans who’d arouse suspicion, I could simply pick off ones who already had one foot in the grave. They aren’t as tasty, but angry mobs don’t pick up a torches and pitchforks when they die.”

“That’s sick.”

“Please.” She snorted. Then her eyes happened across a picture of Mary mounted on the wall. “Tell me, is this *Mrs*. Donnelly?”

I uncomfortably shifted from one foot to the other.

“Well, good news. The two of you are about to be reunited.”

She glided down the stairs, in a movement so smooth I almost didn’t notice until it was already too late. At the very last second, I rushed into the lounge and slammed the door shut.

Through the door, Ms. Flanigan shouted, “Little pig, little pig, please let me in.”

I had to do something. But what? All I had were my tools and Mary’s antique cutlery—

Wait…

The door crashed open with enough force to dent the wall, then Ms. Flanigan entered the dim room, fangs bared.

Quickly I grabbed the torch from my pack, flicked on the beam, and took aim.

My attacker leapt to the ceiling with frightening grace. I tried to pin her down, following the sounds of claws chipping away at the ceiling, but she was too fast–the best I could manage were brief glimpses of silver eyes.

Judging from all the laughter, she quite enjoyed our little game of cat and mouse…

With her hands hooked into claws, Ms. Flanigan lunged at me from the corner of the room. Her nails pinwheeled across my face, opening red stripes across my forehead and cheek, just as I got the beam angled correctly.

There was a sound like bacon sizzling on the grill as we both spun onto the floor. The torch whirled toward the far side of the room, outside reach.

Ms. Flanigan grimaced, black smoke billowed from her forehead, while I fumbled through my belt, found a pair of plyers, pushed myself to my knees, and then pinched them closed around her right fang.

With every last drop of old man strength in my body, I pulled, squeezed, and twisted.

Blinded by rage, Ms. Flanigan thumped me in the chest with more force than a sledgehammer. I experienced a moment of complete weightlessness, brought crashing to an end by the back of my skull hitting the shelf—the same one decorated with Mary’s things. Black dots swirled in front of my eyes as I spilled to the floor.

A single fang was still pinched between my plyers. Already recovered from her burns, Ms. Flanigan probed the gap in her mouth using a long tongue that tapered off into a fine point.

Her eyes narrowed. “You made a big mistake Mr. Donnelly. Just for that, I’m gonna hunt down your entire family. You’ve got a daughter and some bratty grandchildren, right? Oh, it’s been so long since I had a decent meal, you have no idea. I’m gonna rip their throats open and pull out their guts in steaming bundles. But first.” Her jaw popped open like a trap door.

Without warning, Ms. Flanigan sprung forward and seized my neck, her warm tongue dragging along my cheek. A tentacle probing every inch of exposed flesh.

A lone fang hovered inches above my throat. I felt powerless to stop it. This was the end. Forty years earlier, I still wouldn’t have stood a chance.

But then, a blurred, hissing object collided with the side of her head. The cat!

The little critter latched onto Ms. Flanigan, frantically slashing her horrible face. She whirled around attempting to pry the brave little critter off, but its claws were embedded way too deep. Dark blood seeped out of her forehead and throat as the cat carved out patterns of diagonal gashes.

The pair waltzed around, banging into walls and tipping over the bookshelf, which made Mary’s antique cutlery set crashed onto the ground and emptied its contents across the floor. All those tools, each made from pure silver, lay agonizingly close, but my muscles burned with age and fatigue. As the world turned all blurry—possibly from a concussion—the orderly’s chants sounded far in the distance. *At Redburn, you won’t just live. You won’t just live.*

Above my head, the shelf gave way. Even expert workmanship couldn’t withstand a collision with a fella my size.

A picture of Mary toppled onto my lap. The muscles in my arms twanged wildly as I grabbed the photo and kissed her cheek. “I’m so sorry darling. I couldn’t save them. I love you.”

My eyelids closed over, ready to embrace the end. But then, for the first time since she passed, I heard Mary’s voice, loud and angry.

*Are you fecking kidding me, Thomas?*

I opened my eyes.

*Did I accidentally marry some lazy bum who’d take this kinda crap? Didn’t you hear her? That monsters gonna eat our grandbabies. Get up off your arse. You lazy fecker.*

Before me, the furball held on as best it could. Hissing. Fighting. Tearing deep into Ms. Flanigan’s lips. Well, if he could stand up to a vampire, so could I.

Time to dust away the cobwebs from these old bones. With memories of Mary fresh in my mind, I reached forward and fumbled through her antique cutlery.

Forks and spoons, nothing but fecking forks and spoon.

Toward the bottom of the pile I found a knife. Finally. Would it be sharp enough to get the job done? Only one way to find out….

Out in the hall, something hefty—likely Potato face—hurled itself against the front door while other Redburn staff rattled and drummed the windows. Bony talons reached between boards and swiped at the air. Now their mistress felt threatened, they wanted in. *You won’t just live, you won’t live.*

The drill lay close by. I grabbed some wire from my pack while Ms. Flanigan successfully pried the cat off her face and hurled him against the side wall.

That beautiful critter collided with a dull thump, fell onto the floor, then flipped itself right-side up.

As I worked, Ms. Flanigan dropped onto all fours, her snout elongating. Every inch of exposed flesh became black and furry. Fingers webbed themselves together and leathery skin connected her underarms with her back.

That was the limit for my little ally, who blitzed out of the room, at which point the bat-creature refocused its attention on me.

Grunting heavily, I stood, armed and ready. In that moment, the clock rolled back thirty years. I was a young buck in his prime.

A blast of hot air from two powerful nostrils blasted me in the face. With a single flap of her wings, Ms. Flanigan flew across the room, seized me by the chest, rose up into the air, and then slammed us onto the brutal, unforgiving floor. The creature weighed more than a damn ford escort.

The very second we landed that horrible face began reverting to human form. Only this time Ms. Flanigan looked thinner. More delicate. As she glanced down at her torso, her eyes opened wider than dinner plates.

Stabbed into her midsection was the end of my power drill, onto which I’d tied the knife. She’d dropped us with such force the blade punctured a hole in her side.

Still flat on my back, I squeezed the trigger. The drill met some resistance and rotated slowly, gradually tearing apart Ms. Flanigan’s insides, before quickly picking up speed. As she rolled over, the tremendous pressure against my lungs eased.

Outside, the chants trailed off mid-word and the rattling stopped.

Blotting out the pain, I found my feet and grabbed the torch from the far side of the room.

“No. Please.” Ms. Flanigan rasped, powerless to do anything besides rotate her silver eyes toward me.

I pointed the torch directly at her face, took three deep breaths, then said, “Let this be a lesson to, bitch. Never threaten a man’s family.”

At the flick of the switch, she exploded into flames. The embers kicked up a large cloud of dry dust that went everywhere. And when the beast was finally nothing more than a powdery stain, I collapsed into the armchair.

The entire world took a deep breath and sighed. I heard Ms. Flanigan’s mindless army groan outside, all deeply confused about how they'd got there.

The cat limped into the room, one paw curled up against its chest. I gently scooped him into my lap.

A photo of Mary lay in the centre of the room. And now, she almost seemed to be...smiling. In my mind’s eye, I heard her sweet, sweet laugh. And suddenly, for the first time her diagnosis, I found myself laughing, too.

As a group of residents and I strolled through the front gate, we waved at the burly attendant. “How was the view from the summit?” he asked us.

“Worth the effort,” one of my companions called back.

Since the encounter, the staff at Redburn and all its inhabitants had been much more agreeable. Livelier. So far as I could tell, Ms. Flanigan’s ‘trance’ lifted the instant she died. Everybody woke up from a sort of terrible dream, one they couldn’t remember much about.

After a few weeks, since nobody had the slightest idea where the former boss disappeared to, a new manager took over, and things became a lot more fun around here.

Down the street, as I parted ways with the group, one of my friends said, “I’ll see you for Poker tonight then?”

“Absolutely," I replied. "Might be a little late, though. Angela’s bringing the grandkids over. They’ve got some new Nintendo they wanna show me.”

Back home, the one-eyed cat skulked around my garden, meowing impatiently, one paw heavily bandaged. It looked at me as if you say: it's almost noon, where’s lunch?

“Alright, alright,” I said, chuckling.

Shortly after becoming a vampire killer, I’d rushed the cat to a vet, who wrapped up its busted leg and promised me *she’d* be okay. That sure caught me off guard.

In the kitchen, I emptied a tin of cat food into a bowl. Etched along the outer edge was the name I’d christened my new companion—the most beautiful one I could think of.

Mary.

And that, my friends, is how I rediscovered a new zest for life by checking into a retirement home.

So, if you’re around Dublin and looking for a place that’ll let you enjoy an elegant lifestyle in a tranquil environment, with a safety net of highlight skilled nurses available 24 hours a day, have I got the place for you.

Trust me, at Redburn, you won’t just live.

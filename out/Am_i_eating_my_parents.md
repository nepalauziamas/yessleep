"Finally! I got my first salary yesterday. I haven't revealed it to my parents yet, but I will reveal it tomorrow on my mother's birthday!"


This was the thought I had when I slept on the night of 29th of March 2021. But the next morning was.... Different! My parents were not in the house, and they left a weird note for me. 


"Your uncle is not well. We are going to pay him a visit. Food is in the fridge. Take care, son


~Mom"


I got a bit sad as we wouldn't be able to celebrate my mother's birthday together, but I understood the situation and called my friend, Jack, over to have MY DAY! It was my first salary, of course. 


I decided to prepare some food until my friend arrived and pulled on the door of the fridge. It was locked.. Locked? Why? Where is the key? 


I picked up the note left by my parents and realised something weird. The note was written...in my handwriting? How is this possible? Below in small letters was written a word, "attic". Attic? Suddenly, I heard the bell ring. My friend had arrived. I welcomed him into the house. He gave me a huge hug and gifted me a bottle of foreign wine. Time went by as we played computer games, talked about stuff, discussed future plans etc., 


It was evening... We both felt rats hurdling in our stomachs and we decided to prepare food. As I was approaching the fridge, I remembered the note. Attic? Is the key to the fridge in the attic? I went in to check inside the attic and… Found! The key. I hurried back to the fridge, and found Jack standing beside it. I inserted the key! Opened the fridge! What? 

I saw a dense red liquid pouring down from a covered plate. 


Next day, I woke up with the news of Jack being missing. What happened last evening? Why no memories? What was inside that fridge? 


I called another friend of mine who was crying badly on the phone to talk about the unfortunate circumstances. I washed my face and tried to remember everything! Anything! Something!...Nothing! I went to check the fridge. Locked! 

Just a note written in my handwriting.


"I love you jack! You are the best one yet."

What? The bell rang. The other friend, John had arrived. He was crying as he entered the house. I hugged him and made him calm down. 

He slept on the couch after crying for too long, and I decided not to disturb him. 


Then, I remembered the previous note. "Attic".

I went into the attic once again and guess what? Found the key! I ran back to the fridge, horrified. This time I set my phone to record everything. I opened the fridge, and saw some sponge-like dark red material. Then, I woke up the next day with no memories of the previous day whatsoever. I picked up my phone to check the recording. Nothing! The recording… Was deleted. 



P. S. - I have not felt hungry since that day. Though, I have no memories of eating anything at all. What is going on? Somebody help.

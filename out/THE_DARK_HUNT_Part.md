I used to be a religious man. Full of faith and devotion. Thankful towards my creator for the blessing that I have been bestowed upon. 

Then one day, when I thought everything was perfect… when I thought my life was now complete. 

He took my wife from me. 

A tumor in her brain that was found too late. She managed to hide it well from me. Guess she wanted to shorten the pain of handling such a news as much as possible. But in the end, I found out when she couldn’t remember where she put her glasses while holding them in her hand. As my wife passed away, I was left with my only motivation to live on. My daughter. My dear Sarah. I know every parent would say this, but she really was the world to me. My sun and moon. 

It was on her 10th birthday. She wanted to spend time at our family holiday cabin. It was well surrounded by beautiful forestry and lake. She loved it there. Even so because of some much wonderful memories our family had. 

But that day, just as daylight started to fade… she was taken from me. Snatched right in front of my eyes. I couldn’t believe my own eyes when I first saw that … Thing. 

It came out from the woods, galloping on all fours. Pale white skin and long skinny arms. I should have tried to stop it there and then. But I didn’t. I was frozen into place as my terrified mind tried to process what was happing. In that split second of hesitation, I lost Sarah. Forever. 

Now, I don't have any pretty words to say to my maker. So I stopped being a devoted believer nor one to pray. 

It's been 93 days since… or was its 94… doesn’t really matter. But I’ve been hunting these bastards down. I tore through a nest not long ago. Killed three of them. It’s getting easier every time. 

But it wasn’t always easy. These creatures can mimic their victims. First little sounds and noises. Then voices. Given enough time they will mimic the form too. But it seemed short lived as the form quickly becomes rotten and broken… like looking at a zombie in a horror movie. But you can find them out. If, you know what you’re looking for.

Soon or later, I’ll see my beloved daughter again. But after I’ve wiped out these vermin for good. 

These past few days, I came back to my cabin. I’ve only been to my house in the city once ever since the incident, but just to collect a few personal things and put the house up for sale. 

I decided to rid myself of everything about my past life. The house, the car, everything. I only had one purpose now. My sole purpose in this miserable hell hole of a life I was left with. Hunting. I don’t drink or go cry in a dark corner and scream profanities at the creator in selfpity. No. I’ll use that energy and determination to focus on my goal. 

I’ve been tearing through the forest behind my cabin. Tracking and chasing these creatures. Killing and burning them to satiate my building thirst for revenge. After what seemed weeks, I had to make my way down for supplies. It was when I made it down to civilization that I realized I had been tearing through a whole mountain range that the forest lead into. Without realizing it I had travelled over a 50miles away from where the cabin was. 

I found a gas station as I came back to civilization. Obviously, the guy behind the counter looked at me with a terrified face. I looked like shit I suppose. He kept asking me if I was okay and if I needed assistance. I assured him I was fine and gave him some bullshit story about being lost in the mountains and just found my way down. I can see it in his eyes that he didn’t buy it. I got the supplies and quickly made my way out. I could feel his suspicious eyes following me out.

That night I found myself renting a room at the local motel. First hot shower in months. It felt like my body was soaking up the water as my muscles started to relax. For the first time since I’ve started the ‘Hunt’, I felt relaxed. The bed even more so. It wasn’t hard falling asleep. A bit more easily than I thought. No nightmares, no unstable or uneasy feelings and no emotional outbursts that prevented and deprived me of this sleep. Nothing. I slept with ease…. Let my guard down. 

Big mistake. 

I was woken by sounds coming from outside my room. Hunting the creatures, I got sensitive to my surroundings. Especially sound. I woke up, clear and completely focused. A knock came from the door. 

“Mr. Bernstein!”

I take a quick glimpse out the window and notice the unmistakable flashing red and blue light. Walking towards the door, calm as I can be, I opened it to come face to face with two men in suits. Judging by the couple of uniforms lingering around the back I figure these two are detectives. I look at them calmly and it seemed to unsettle them, even disturb them in a certain manner. 

“What can I do for you officers?”

“Mr. Bernstein, we need you to come with us down to the station.”

“Did I do something wrong?”

The two men were now clearly uncomfortable. It seemed that they didn’t want to speak here out in the open. The uniforms started to draw in a few steps in a sterner stance, but not intimidating. At least not for me. The two men were indeed detectives with the local police as they introduced themselves in their usual manner. They continued with their lines as I stood listening to them.

“Sir, we’re investigating the disappearance of… of you actually.”

“You and your daughter. We’ve been searching for you for a whole month.”

“I thought as much. Let me get my things.”

The two men seemed more at ease as I seemed to conform to their request. I came back inside the room to pack. Didn’t take much time as there was really nothing to pack. A few supplies and my backpack. That’s it. This is all I have left now. I came back out and one of the uniforms escorted me to their car. He insisted to take my backpack that had my axe strapped onto it. The two men who were at my door pointed towards it and then they took the axe with them. Very carefully. I knew quickly were this was going. But I stayed calm. Nothing to lose really. 

The entire trip back to the station was a silent one. The detective… um… Daren, that’s it, detective Daren tried to make small talk with me. Investigation tactics maybe. Didn’t really care. At least they haven’t cuffed me or anything. But soon Daren stopped talking when he realized I wasn’t much of a talker. Down at the station everything went as I thought. They asked me where me and my daughter was all this time and what happened. Especially my daughter. I told them the truth. 

“My daughter died. She was taken by a wild animal.”

“I’m very sorry for your loss. And what have you been doing since she had passed Mr. Bernstein?”

“I’ve been hunting them. All of them. Every last one of them.”

“I see.”

The interrogation officer, Miles, seemed concerned. He was confused but I could see he was buying into my story. Parts of it at least. I’m sure they think I killed her. Disappeared for months and suddenly I’m found in some remote motel alone? Classic hit and stash case. My little smirk didn’t go unnoticed. It somewhat angered the interrogating officer.

“Something funny Mr. Bernstein?”

“Just thought myself stupid. I lose my daughter to some beast from the woods. And I thought she would be my sole purpose in life. Now I’ve lost my wife and my daughter. The only two reasons for my purpose of living and I’m still alive. I found a new purpose. To kill every last one of those beasts… Just thought it was funny that I found a reason to live.”

“We’ve checked your cabin, numerous times. You were nowhere to be seen.”

“I was in woods… hunting.”

I could see Miles, had nothing more to say. And after some police talk about looking into things more, I was free to go. For now. They told me to stay put and don’t go far. I again obliged to do so. I got a room at a nearby motel. Slept without trouble. Again, the nightmare comes to haunt me. But, I'm used to it now.  

I remember the first few weeks when it was hard to sleep, and nightmares would deprive me of sleep. Vivid pictures of my daughter being taken away by that creature. But as the weeks became months, I have learnt to embrace those nightmares as my new fuel to keep the raging fire burning and roaring within me. If this fire burns out… I’ll burn out. So I sleep. Expecting to revisit that day. To see my daughter’s face one more time. To keep the anger and burning rage revitalize my purpose to keep on going. I hear her screams, her call for help… I open my eyes… calm and silent. 

The next day detective Daren came by to tell me that they had found my daughter’s grave that I buried her in. I had already given consent for them to remove the body for autopsy and Daren thought it was appropriate to let me know… and also to ‘escort’ me to the station

As I wait in the interrogation room, again, I sit and think about the past few weeks and what to do next. I had planned to return to the mountains and continue raging my one-man crusade towards eliminating as much of those vermin as I can until my dying breath. But now… I’m not too sure. I want to rest. Even hopes of rebuilding my life grabbed hold of me at one time. Civilization has gripped me and brought me down to earth again, and I’m starting to get confused. I got to get out of here. 

As I contemplated on what to do next, detective Daren came in. He told me on their find upon examining Sarah’s body and how they have determined that the cause of death was indeed consistent with those deaths associated with animal attacks. But they’ve also found numerous blood stains on the axe that came from mostly none-human origins. ‘Mostly’ was the key word in his sentence. 

“Mr. Bernstein, we’ve found human DNA from multiple donners on the axe. One of which matches that of your daughter’s.”

The first bastard that took my daughter away. It mimicked Sarah’s voice. It had her eyes. If I gave it time it would have taken her form too. But I killed it before it could. That’s it. They steal DNA to mimic their victims. There was a hiker couple. They seemed harmless. Until their skin started rotting right before my eyes. They can’t maintain their disguise form for long. It’s just part of their camouflage to lure new prey. Multiple donners. Looks like the bastards got me in the end. 

“Mr. Bernstein. Why did you do it? Why did you kill your daughter?” 

“I didn’t kill my daughter.”

My firm voice and stern attitude didn’t impress the detective. He was already sure of his verdict. ‘Guilty’, and he is determined to pursue it and make sure I pay. He pressed me for the truth. 

“Come now. Tell me the truth. The evidence points out that you’ve attacked your daughter with your own axe and then threw her in the woods for the animals to finish her off!”

“I… didn’t… kill… my daughter.”

I spoke in a cracking yet calm and stern voice. I looked him straight in the eye. I had nothing to prove. Not to him. Not to anyone.

Detective Daren stood still. Looking into my eyes. He expected me to look away I guess, but instead met with something else. The eyes of a man not afraid of death. The eyes of a wifeless husband and daughterless father.

It shook him up. He left the room without another word. That night I was put in one of the holding cells at the station. All they had was my axe. But I guess it was all they needed. Some would say it should anger me that they blame me for my daughter’s death. The death I’ve been trying so hard to avenge. But surprisingly, it didn’t. Surprised myself to be frank.

Lying in my cell I was dozing off. But then I heard something. A clicking noise. No, it can’t be. I lay still, even quieted my breathing to focus on hearing. Then, I heard it again. That clicking sound. That damn sound that woke me up countless nights. Urging me to bear my axe in a fit of rage. That clicking noise. It’s here. It came for me I suppose. The blood of its kind on my hands. Revenge against revenge. Rage over rage. My heart calms and my thought deepen as my eyes adjust to the darkness of the room. Damn. If only I had my axe. 

The noise is now a lot closer. I peer into the darkness. Hard to make out anything. Light silhouettes confuse my sight as I try hard to make out my environment. But then… I saw it. Two red shimmers in the dark. Damn, an adult form. 

During my hunt I studied these creatures to better understand them. Read it in a book by an ancient Chinese man, Know your enemy and all that. Anyway, I found out that these things change as they grow. One of the main changes are the glow in their eyes. They start off yellow and then become red as they mature. But the real deal are the ones with the silver glowing eyes. The alphas. Not many of them I figure, as they are usually take on the leader role of a pack. But these red eyed adults are just as dangers. Stronger and faster than the yellow eyed younglings.  

I looked around the cell. Nothing much to use as a weapon. With that I started to dismantle bed. Tearing through the bed I hear a noise approaching the cell. I turn around to face the bars that are holding me. Outside it I see a person. A man in uniform. I know its not a police officer because its eyes glowed red under the shadow that was casting on its face. 

“How does it feel to be caged up like an animal? How does it feel to be in a vulnerable situation?”

“…”

I didn’t respond to him. I couldn’t. I was too shocked to say anything. This was the first time I’ve heard any of them speak in such a natural manner. If not for those glowing red eyes I would have been sure it was human.

“Tell me. How does it feel Daniel Bernstein?” 

“You… know my name?”

I was confused. How did it know my name? These things only get parts of the memory when they steal the form of their prey. Or maybe so I thought. Then again, I’ve never met any of these things that spoke so … fluently. But, the creature’s next words completely caught me off guard. 

“Sure I know your name. I’m a police officer. I have access to things like records.” 

I froze. With that one information I knew what it meant. It could maintain its form for longer than any other creatures I had encountered. Enough to perfect its speech and retain memories to impersonate the police officer and gain access to documents. This was a creature on a whole new level. 

“Are you here to kill me?”

I looked straight into its red glowing eyes as I stepped forward. I wanted to provoke it. I wanted it to feel anger, fear and despair. It looked back at me and grinned. The first time I ever saw a creature show facial expression under disguise. It was sickening. Acting as if they were human. Rage burned like wildfire inside me. But then, the creature took a step back. 

“I’m not here to kill you… just yet. I’m here to tell you…”

I waited for the next words. But it grinned at me… no smirked at me. It was toying with me and enjoying the moment. The bastard. Then slowly it opened its mouth. The words that cut into my brain and made it bleed with anger…

“I’m here to tell you Daniel… that you killed the wrong one…”

“What?”

“You see Daniel, I was the one that took your daughter. I gave her to my new born to take and consume… I saw her life being drained by my child. I saw the light of life flicker and fade from her beautiful eyes… green… with a hint of blue… It was beautiful.”

I stood there as the creature spoke words that didn’t compute inside my head. I my brain shut off … no, more like my reasoning shut off. I couldn’t comprehend what it was saying. Until slowly it crept into my head. It slowly sank in and it became clearer and clearer and clearer … and….

“You… you took her? It was you?”

“Yes Daniel, it was me. I took your daughter to give life to mine and you killed my child to avenge yours… ironic.”

It hit me like a ton of bricks. I couldn’t focus for a while. All this time I thought I avenged the death of my daughter when in reality, the one that started all this was still alive and standing in front of me. Toying with me and mocking me. Mocking my daughter’s death. My rage burned even stronger like hell fire… pure rage and hatred flared my soul. 

“I will kill you. I will rip out your beating heart and lay it at my daughter’s grave. Then I will hunt down the rest of your kind and burn them all to hell.”

The creature looked at me and smirked. It looked amused. But his red glowing eyes said otherwise. There was anger and there was rage. I can see it. Its rage for the loss of its young. Then it came towards the cell door and opened it. I stood still and prepared to defend and attack. But, it didn’t come in. All it did was smirk again.

“You do that Daniel… if you can survive that long.”

Before I could say something, it turned around and faded into the shadows. It looked as if it just faded away like a shadow. But before it completely disappeared it glared its red eyes at me. Then I saw it. The red eyes slowly turned faint until it became bright silver. Silver with a hint of greenish blue… odd. They never have mixed colours. But then again, I’ve never met one that talked and act like this one. Its eyes glowed bright as it looked at me one last time before it completely disappeared. I quickly ran out the cell and scoured the area. But it was nowhere to be found. 

Damn, it was an alpha? Was it an alpha all along hiding its identity somehow? Or did it become an alpha? I would never know at this point. All I know is that I had to get out of the police station and chase after it. Hunt it down and kill it. Perhaps that’s exactly what it wants. It knows I’ll be on the run with the police out looking for me. It’s clever. And I don’t have a choice. I’ll be behind bars if I stay here. To tell you the truth, the thought came across my mind to just quit. The perfect opportunity presented. But now… I can’t quit. Not after I know that the creature responsible for my daughter’s death is still out there. 

So, I took off. The strangest thing was that it was too easy getting out. Not a sole to be seen. I thought \[Strange, where are all the police?\] not that I’m complaining. I found my belongings and my axe at the ‘evidence locker’ near the holding cells. No one. No guards no police. The entire station was quiet. To be honest it was a small town police station and there weren’t many police officers to begin with. But no one? I didn’t stand around to investigate and just got out of there. Night had fallen when I got out. I ran straight into the woods and made my way back towards the cabin. I knew the woods pretty well by now and had no problem with directions. I had this eerie feeling that I was being watched but didn’t find any trace or evidence of any of the creatures nearby. 

50miles seemed shorter than I thought. I was back by morning the next day just as the sun was rising. I packed up my things as light as I can. Only the essentials. I thought of torching the place like in a movie cliché but I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. Burning this place would mean burning down the only remaining place to remember my daughter by. But I won’t be back for sometime. 

I’ll try to update you when I can and if I survive.

I’m going after that bluish green silver eye. I’ll find it and kill it. I won’t rest until I see the life fade from those eyes…. If it’s the last thing I do…

   

Wish me luck… I guess…

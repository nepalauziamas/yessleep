Of course, nobody truly recognizes him. No one but me, but that's an odd exception. You see, Dan has an...odd sort of power. 

The man just blends in, no matter the crowd, no matter the time, no matter the place, he blends in. No one can explain it, he just does. Now, Dan didn't start off knowing this.

He was about 16 when he first noticed. He saw that no one point him out from a crowd, no matter how small. It started with him testing his newfound ability. A bit of petty theft here, a bit of, shall we say, deviant behavior there, nothing too harmful.

Dan grew up, of course, but he didn't use this ability for evil. He didn't use it for good either, of course, as his life was good anyway. But then it started taking a downturn. His work fired him, his wife left him, his kids wouldn't talk to him, his life was, as you might say, shit.

That's when he started. Dan began using his powers for terrible, terrible things. He used it to slip into a bank, steal all the money, and slip out. Afterwards, he simply couldn't help himself. 

Dan started doing more terrible things, things I feel sick to even think about. Women went missing, and we're found days later, bodies defiled, necks snapped. The oldest was 25. The youngest was 7. Nobody knew who was doing these heinous acts. But I knew.

I knew Dan ever since he was a kid.  We we're both going to the same school, same classes. We were the outcasts, losers, nobody noticed us, but that's how we liked it. One day, we sealed the deal on our friendship, and became blood brothers.

Ever since, I can pick him out of a crowd, I can see him when he thinks he isn't seen. Well, I got a wife, and Dan was, let's say interested in her. He made it clear he found her attractive, and I wasn't in the know on his fucked up crimes. But I saw him take her that night, and it's changed me forever.

We were on our way home from the bar, and we were in a big group. Dan wasn't there, so imagine my surprise when I see him pop out of the shadows, and make off with my wife. I called out, but no one saw him. They say that her body was the worst case they had ever seen. 

I did my research, I've checked my facts. Every single thing I've said here has Dan written all over it. I'm telling you all do you can at least attempt to be careful, but I know I'm the only one who can do anything.

So now, I bide my time. That asshole isn't gonna take another. I have a daughter now, and another wife. He's made his affections clear, and I'm not letting him take either of them. I have my gun ready and loaded for the next time that fucker comes along.

You probably don't recognize Dan.

But I sure as hell do.

Before I went to sleep last night, I could’ve never known how real and authentic dreams could feel. Or rather I had known, but just never experienced it before. Nevertheless, as my head hit the pillow and I closed my eyes, it felt as though I was instantaneously thrown into a nightmare. 
I found myself in what looked like a maze, and I looked around, feeling bewildered and confused. As I advanced through the endless rooms, with their tan spotless walls, clean, dull blue floors and spotted ceiling tiles, I’d come upon a rather small child. My heart sank and I doubted my eyes. She appeared to be very young girl, around 4 or 5 years old sitting on a dingy yellow couch, and a glass, old timey coffee table that felt out of place in this spotless labyrinth. 

The feeling of uncertainty was overpowered by my concern for the child, and having been the only normal thing I’ve come across in this nightmare, I decided to sit next to it. She was playing with a box, the ones that used a thin flap to close, magnetic so that the box would stay shut. I stayed with her for awhile, but suddenly I got a sinking feeling, and I felt a shot of fear course through me. Getting a better look at the room I was in, I realized how much of a disadvantage I was at. 

It was a closed off room, with walls on either side of the only entrance blocking my view. However I could see past the corners of these walls if I leaned to the side on this couch, and my heart sank even lower and burned with terror as I did. Looking around the corner, I saw a glimpse of tall man walking towards us. I couldn’t fully see him at first, just barely the coat of his suit, but as he got closer all the air in my lungs escaped, and I was frozen in fear. 

The way he walked was deceivingly normal, as his legs movements seemed natural, but only one thing was amiss. As he approached, i was horrified to discover his knees seemed to be dislocating and popping back into place with every step. Something about his face was unnatural, with skin stretched- and I mean stretched- over normal looking features. his blonde hair was short and spiked, and his wire framed glasses stayed stuck on his face as if they were glued. 

The most troubling thing by far, though, was his arms. He was carrying one of those stereotypical gift boxes, the ones with bows and ribbon with a detachable top and bottom half. His arms wrapped around the box like they were being pulled in by some magnetic force, giving them a grotesque shape as they contorted to cover as much surface area as possible on the box. I gaped as he walked towards us and sat down, staring at us with dark brown eyes I was almost sure I could see the darkest depths of the universe in.

He turned to open the box which he then turned upside down, as if to dump out its contents. But nothing fell out. I was slightly relieved, and my eyes closed and I breathed deeply as the burning feeling of fear in my chest slowly began to dissipate. Until I heard a thud. I looked frantically at the floor of where I heard it, but I saw nothing. I came to the realization that the child and the man were now gone, and looked up to see them turning a corner hand in hand, and I chased after them.

I didn’t know who he was, but if I let him go with that child I would never forgive myself. I lurched off the couch, taking off after them, and eventually caught sight of them again. As I was about to reach out to the girl, something grabbed my wrist from behind. I saw a creature, which looked human but whose skin was severely charred and burnt. All except for their eyes. They were wide open, and I felt they were sucking the life out of me as they stared into mine. 

It was dragging on the floor, and I could feel it’s inhuman strength through its grip, that it was holding me back with a fraction of. At that moment, I squeezed my eyes shut, as I felt my sheets with my hands and realized I was suddenly back in my room. my head spun as I felt overwhelming pressure and a burning sensation behind my eyes that worsened as I moved them. I’m rubbing my eyes, now, and I’m going to the kitchen to get some water; but first, I’ll just have to remember how to open them.

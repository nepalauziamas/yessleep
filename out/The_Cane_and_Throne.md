There once was a small village on the borders of a glorious golden

empire. The people of this village were simple farmers and laborers,

who lived in small homes outside of the village center. Although the

wilds around their town were filled with dangers, the people of town

never seemed to fear for their safety, and the farms prospered year

after year. The children were taught simply to stay out of the wilds,

to be home before dark, and to treat each other with kindness and

decency.

In the fall of each year, there would be a grand harvest

festival in the town square. The cobblestone streets would be lined

with chains of autumn leaves, and the smell of nutmeg and cooked

squash filled the surrounding area. Within the square there was a

small stone stage, furnished with a glorious wooden throne, made from

the branches and foliage of the forest. The backing wound and twisted

up into beautiful points, almost as if the throne had been grown

instead of crafted. Throughout the year, this stage would be left

untouched, but on the day of the festival it was adorned with the

bright crimsons and ochres of fall.

Leaning against the throne was a small gnarled cane. The branch

from which it had been shaped seemed to be of white birch, and the

hand grip at the top seemed formed for a very specific hand. Along

the length of the cane were many small notches carved to form tally

marks. Young Sveta had spent a whole day counting them. 84. She had

stared from the market stall where her mother sold their grain, and

had counted each one. She would not go onto the stage, as that would

be against the law, but she could count from a distance. Some of them

weathered and ancient looking. Some of them fresh.

When the day of the festival came, the entire village poured

into the town square. Stalls sold sweet and savory hand pies, games

were played by the children, and the masonry shook with boisterous

music and rowdy dancing. A year of hard work was being rewarded. But

the parents of young children seemed to have grief written on their

strained smiles. Sveta noticed that her mother, who was usually full

of joy and rarely stern, was particularly sour. She wanted to ask her

what was troubling her, but she knew that her mother would not say.

So she kept silent.

The mayor stepped onto the stone stage, his harvest festival

finest glimmering in the evening light. He bellowed out to the crowd.

“People of the village! It is time for our most honored

tradition! The crowning of our Harvest Royalty!”

The crowd cheered, and a small area was cleared away in the

front of the stage. Children of all ages ran to the area and formed a

line. Sveta began to go, but her mother clasped a hand on her

shoulder.

“But mother!” Sveta said. “I want to be the Harvest Princess!

I was too young to go last year!”

Her mother's face was dour.

“Do not speak of such things Sveta! You will stay here. Mind

me, I know what's best.”

Sveta rarely argued with her mother, so she quietly listened.

The mayor stepped forward to make another announcement.

“Very good! And now, it is my honor to bring forth our esteemed

Queen of the Harvest, Lady Koldunya!”

The crowd cheered as a female form stepped forward from behind a

small screen. She was elegant and tall, wearing a long red and orange

robe which glimmered in the light. Her hair was covered by a hood,

her face covered by the bone white visage of a deer's skull. Her

antlers were long and tangled through with garlands of autumn leaves.

She nodded briefly at the crowd, and sat down in the throne, taking

the cane from it's resting place and resting its end on the floor.

The mayor nervously left the stage, still smiling to the crowd.

He passed from child to child, raising his hand above the head of

each one. Lady Koldunya would tap her cane once, and the child would

be shooed back into the crowd to the arms of their parents. Lady

Koldunya would tap her cane twice, and the child would step forward

to the cheers of the crowd. After many rounds of this, only two

children remained. Piotr, the handsome town bully, and Galina, a

portly and kind daughter of the town smith. The town was oddly hushed

as the mayor raised his hand over the heads of the children. First

Galina.

No taps of the cane.

Then Piotr.

Two taps.

The town cheered loudly as Galina ran back to her parents,

sobbing. Sveta searched the crowd for Piotr's parents, but could not

see them.

Piotr took the stage, and was given a cloak of red and orange.

Lady Koldunya stood next to him, towering over him. She handed him

the cane. She produced a smaller mask from her robes, white and

eyeless and round, and placed it on Piotr's head. The two walked off

the stage and through the parting crowd as Piotr raised the cane in

the air, cheering; “I am the Harvest Prince! I am the Harvest

Prince!” They walked to the edge of the square, and towards the wilds

on the edge of town, and then so far away they could not be seen

anymore.

The next week, Sveta came back to the market with her mother. Piotr

was nowhere to be seen, nor his family. The stage had been cleaned,

and the villagers were taking down the decorations from the rest of

the square. Sveta's mother was smiling, and told her how much she

loved her. Sveta saw the cane once again resting against the throne

of wood. She once again counted the notches, and saw a new, fresh

notch. 85. Sveta's mother placed a hand on her shoulder and said “Not

all prizes are worth winning.”

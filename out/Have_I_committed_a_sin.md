We stay here, Sprint" said Gwendolyn as she got off her horse. She then sat down on the ground and took the map out of her bag. While looking around the map she noticed there was a small village near the river Kamaro so she decided to spend the night there. She got up from the ground and on the horse and they both slowly started walking towards the village as the sun was setting down. 


When they arrived at the village, Gwendolyn was surprised to find the place being quiet and dark. She assumed that everyone was asleep and so she didn't think about it that much. They roamed around only to find that there is no hotel nor place to stay to spend the night. So she tried knocking on one of the doors. 


No one answered. She then knocked and asked "Is anybody home? Hello?" but no one answered. "Maybe they are all in deep sleep, Sprint" she said certainly with a bit of doubt. She then tried opening the door but the door was locked. She then started to be worried and decided to leave but before she left she heard a noise coming from the house she just knocked on and decided to stay and investigate.


She knocked harder this time on the door but no reply once again. So she kicked down the door only to find a disturbing scene. There was blood everywhere, human corpses dismantled all around the house except for the one at the door. The corpse was immediately turn around only to find that it's face was eaten along with it's fingers. Gwendolyn then asked her self "if everyone here is dead then who made the loud noise?"


Out of fear, Gwendolyn immediately existed the house and got on her horse. She looked around and saw there was no one near her. Sprint then sensed Gwen's fear which gave him the green light to instantly to run away as possible. When they arrived at the bridge to leave, the bridge started to collapse but thankfully Sprint was able to throw Gwen off his back to safety. Sprint then died resulting in his own death. 


Gwendolyn was in pain and agony. She was full of hatred and vengeance. So she decided to go back and find out what was going on even if it costed her own life. Her search continued she searched all the houses. But in every house a new blood chilling scene was scene. Gwen was wondering who or what thing can be possible for such thing. She then noticed that someone was following her. 


When she turned around but no one was there. But she felt like she was being watched. Her walk was now faster and her steps were much wider. She arrived to the river Kamaro where she saw a boy in the river with his head out of the  water whose arm was missing. The boy had short blonde hair. Terror surrounded her soul. Why is there a kid in the river? Why is his arm missing? Has someone cut it off? Has something eaten it? Gwen had so many questions but one of the most important one was "Is he alive?" She pulled him and shook his body. The boy did not respond. She then dragged back to the village where he put him on a bench. 


She then search the houses for alchohol and things to sanitize the wound and to tie it up. After she tied the boy's arm his conscience returned and he was awake. When he saw Gwendolyn he took out his knife in be left pocket and screamed in terror and told her to get away from him or he'll kill her. Gwendolyn was shocked of what the kid just said and tried to calm him down. She said " Don't worry I am not here to hurt I am here to h...". 

"SHUT UP" said the kid " You came here acting as one of us and then you killed all of us... You killed my parents you whore" 

Gwen was now even more confused and petrified of what the kid just said. But she wasn't planning to give up yet. " I am not sure what you are talking about, I am Gwendolyn I am.."
 
"SHUT UP" said the kid again. 

Gwendolyn then told him " If i was bad would I have treated your wounds?". The kid thought for a min and said "No... but I still don't trust you".

"That's okay" said Gwen " I am new here and what you probably experienced here wasn't good for your physical nor mental health so I understand you are frightening but I am not here to hurt so can you please tell me, what happened here?"

The boy sighed and said " Okay.. but you will keep your distance far from me"

Gwendolyn agreed to the offer.

The boy started " I don't how long has it been but it's probably hasn't been longer than a day.. *cough* She came and said she is gonna be a resident in the village. Her name was Cassandra. She was a very beautiful young girl with long blond hair and ocean blue eyes. She was very sweet and nice.. untill one of villagers caught what she was..."
Gwen asked nervously " What was she doing?"

The boy replied " She was inhuman.. She killed people's dogs and cats. She cut off their heads and hid them somewhere no one can find them. When the villagers found out she was thrown away from the village, only for her to return after 2 days. But when she returned she was dragging a human corpse with her through the village. The entire village was frightened by her. Later on she killed people from our village but no one knows how she achieve on murdering an entire village in one day."

Gwendolyn frightened from this woman decided to leave this village along with the boy. The boy then shaking from what he experienced made a loud creek and started crying. Gwendolyn went and hugged and was about to say  "Everything is going to be okay we are gonna..." she got hit with the knife in the chest. 

"Thank you for saving me" said the boy " But I still need to avenge those who tried to stop me from killing people and animals."

Gwen asked asked while gushing blood from here mouth " What.. are.. you talking..?"

"Ah.. yes" replied the boy " forgot to tell you I lied. There was no girl Cassandra. I was the one doing all the killing in this village and I am going to continue killing for as long as I live. Now you will die a very fast death with no suffering.

Gwen looked at him and said to herself "What have I done? Have a done good by saving a life like his or have a done a sin unforgivable that even the mighty God can not forgive? But how could have I known?

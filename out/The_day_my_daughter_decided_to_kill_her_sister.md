My name is sara and ive been married with josh for 5 years. We have twins, mara and lily, they have only 4 years

Since they were born the doctors said that one of them may experiment some mental problems, but nothing so bad that we would need to look for professional help until they were old enought to see it

We never knew wich one of them was the one that was supposed to have proplems so we treat them both the same

A week ago mara started to have this kind of rage attaks were she hurted us or her sister, usually screaming or punching us. We decided to take her to the doctor to see what was happening. They ran some tests on her but everything came up normal.

We forgot it and continued with our lives till one day the school called and told us that mara had started a fight and a kid ended up going to the hospital because he fell on his head

When josh and i got to the school they took us to the principals office and we saw our daughter sat on a chair. It wasn’t mara, it was lily. You know, when you have twins you learn to tell them apart but people usually confuse them

I tell the director that it was lily the one sitting in his office and he looked at her and then said 

“Oh, im sorry, she havent said a word so i just assumed that she was mara for the recent problem”

I didn’tlike how he just assumed who she was but i let it go. We talked to the principal and then went to the hospital to talk to the other child’s mom

Whe accorded that we would pay the hospital bill if they didnt press charges and then left to go home with our two daughters

When we arrived we talked to lily about what happened and she said that she didn’t mean to send that kid to the hospital, they were just playing when he did something she didn’t like and she pushed him and he fell

Whe believed her but told to be more careful with others. We went to see mara but she was asleep so we went to sleep

I woke to screams in lilys room

“Mara what are you doing”
“I cant let you say what happened today, you have to die”

Hmmmm what?

I woke josh and we both went to lilys room and saw that mara was sitting on lily and had a knife in hand

“Mara! Ehat are you doing”
“Mom, im just playing”

I took the knife from her and asked her to go wait on her room. When she left with josh i asked lily

“What just happened”
“I don’t know, she came here and told me that she was going to kill me” 

I told her that she was being ridiculous, they were sisters, why would she try to kill her?
I told lily to go back to sleep and went to talk to mara

“Why did you have a knife?”
“I found it under lilys pillow, i was asking her why did she have it and she told me she forgot to take it to the kitchen so i said i was going to kill her for being stupid, but i was joking”

Oh god, this girls were going to kill me. I said good bye and also told her to go back to sleep. When josh and i were on our room he said

“I dont know mara, there is something wrong with mara”
“I know we’ll take her to the doctor tomorrow morning”
“Good, now lets sleep, its 2 am”

When i woke up i was going to wake up mara to take her to the doctor but when i got to her room i saw the most terrible thing i have seen

She had a knife in her chest, i screamed and called josh and when he appeared on the door way he was pale, he hugged me and called the police. Lily was in shok, she didnt say a word while the police looked for some clues of what had happenes

I spent 3 weeks in bed, i didnt eat, didn’t shower or eat enough. One day i decided i needed to be strong for my other daugher so i went to her room to talk to her

I found a knife under her bed, i also found her diary and decided i wanted to take a look, just to see how was she after her sisters death 

The was a page with her sisters death date, it said

“I cant let mara say the truth and i dont trust in her anymore, i think is time to make something permanent”

I was stunned, it seemed like my daughter killed her sister. I went looking for josh and when i got to him i showed him the diary and he told me we needed to talk to lily before making conclusions 

What happened next made me sick

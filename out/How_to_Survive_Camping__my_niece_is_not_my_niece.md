I run a private campground.  There’s [a lot of odd stuff](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/mjkts1/how_to_survive_camping_i_did_the_thing_the_thing/) that lives here, and I’m not just talking about the people who willingly camp in the low parts that flood every time it rains.  No, I mean the inhuman things.  And while my family has made quite an effort at figuring out what they are, there’s still a lot we don’t know.

I’m starting to learn, though.  Things have got to change.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

I was asked to babysit my niece.  Or rather, the old sheriff’s wife got asked to babysit.  Tyler’s wife is not quite ready to let me do it, considering the whole kidnapping incident.  I’m not sure she’s ready for *anyone* to babysit, as that would require letting her daughter leave her sight.  Tyler insisted, however.  She needed some time off.  The stress of worrying about the campground and unnatural things was clearly getting to her.  They’d go somewhere over the weekend, somewhere *busy*, with people, where inhuman creatures are sparsely found - or at least, much better at hiding.  But he didn’t tell her the latter.

She was quick to shoot down Tyler’s suggestion of letting me babysit.  She didn’t want her daughter near the campground.  She didn’t want me there at her house long-term.  Monsters follow me, she said.  Which… isn’t entirely untrue.  So Tyler suggested that they ask the old sheriff instead, as he knew from conversations with me that the old sheriff is both reliable and on good terms with the family.  The old sheriff suggested that they ask his wife instead.

And his wife agreed.

The only problem is, the old sheriff’s wife knows that my niece is not my niece.  And she’s not about to play nanny for a changeling just to indulge it.

Once my brother and his wife were on their weekend road trip, I got a text from the old sheriff’s wife that she was on her way over.  I met her in the driveway, wondering what the matter was.  I wasn’t in suspense long.  She got out and started hauling things out of the trunk of the car.  Collapsible playpen.  A crib.  A tote of diapers, bottles, and formula.  And this sling thing that the baby goes in I guess???

“Hold up, this wasn’t what we told Tyler we were doing,” I said hastily.

“Right, because he doesn’t know his baby is a changeling right now.”  She shoved the sling thing at me.  “But we know better.”

“But-”

She fixed me with a steely gaze.

“I will wring that thing’s neck before the weekend is over.  Now let me show you how to wear that sling.”

She also gave me a litany of instructions on how to care for an infant changeling.  I’m not entirely sure how much of what she said was specific to changelings, so I don’t recommend leaving your small children around me anytime soon.  I’m still not qualified for more than briefly holding them and then hastily handing them back.

There were some parts about infant care that were simplified, at least.

“She likes honey so you could probably get away with feeding her nothing but that and ignore the bottles.  She can feed herself.”

“Aren’t you not supposed to give honey to infants?”

“Sweetie, this is a fairy, you could feed her meth and she’d be fine.”

So that was cool, I didn't have to do bottles.  Then when we were done lugging her crib and playpen and all the other assorted baby crap, we returned to the car to get her out of the backseat.

The child seat was empty.

“Oh good, she let herself out,” the sheriff’s wife said.  “Have a good weekend!”

And before I could say anything else, the sheriff’s wife dove into the driver’s seat and hastily backed out of my driveway and drove off.

Really not a good sign.

I looked around the exterior of the house a bit to try and find the changeling.  When that failed, I searched the interior.  She was in my kitchen, drinking my coffee.

“Excuse me,” I said, “but how the hell did you get in?”

“The front door.”

Sarcasm isn’t nearly as fun when it’s being used against you.

“Did you… *walk*?  I thought you couldn’t walk yet.”

“I don’t skip leg day.”

She shakily lifted the coffee mug with both hands and slurped noisily.  Keep in mind that this is an infant we’re talking about.  More chub than muscle.  Watching her act like a normal grown-up in this teeny tiny pudgy body was a little disturbing.

“Okay, but… you weren’t invited in.”

“I’m family, you know,” she replied cheekily.  “It’s allowed.”

“You damn well are not family.”

I checked the pot to see if she’d at least left some for me.  She had not.

“Eh, technicalities.  But to answer your real question: thresholds don’t keep me out.  I am of a privileged species.”

Said with no small amount of arrogance, I might add.

“And you use that to lay around in a crib and get your diaper changed,” I muttered under my breath.

“You shouldn’t disparage what I do.  It’s saving your ass, remember?”

That was true.  I apologized and went to sort out the pile of stuff the sheriff’s wife had left for me.  For the most part, I just let the changeling tell me what she wanted.  She did want the crib.  She didn’t want the playpen - a “baby cage” she called it, dismissively.  And for food, she certainly didn’t want formula or baby food.  There’d been enough of that.  Black coffee, she said, and maybe a steak.  Raw.

“You don’t have teeth!” I snapped.  “I’m not putting a steak in the blender.”

“I don’t?”

I glanced over to where she sat on the floor.  I had yet to see her walk.  She just… sort of moved herself around when I wasn’t looking.  As I glanced down, she smiled, revealing a row of sharp canines, like the smile of a shark.

“Steak it is,” I muttered.

So that’s how Friday went.  On Saturday morning, I sat a jar of honey down in front of her on the table.  She could fend for herself for lunch, I said.  I had work to do out in the forest.  My plan was to go investigate those patches of snow again and hopefully this time I wouldn’t get side-tracked by blundering after a voice like I was some idiot camper that didn’t read the rules.

“You wouldn’t leave me alone in your house, would you?” she asked innocently.

I was about to make a curt response that I damn well would, but I stopped myself short.  Her eyes glittered and the broad smile on her face was anything but that of a naïve baby.  She wasn’t asking because she was incapable of taking care of herself.  She was reminding me that I was about to leave a changeling *unsupervised* inside of my home.

“Fine,” I groaned.  “You can come with me.”

I grabbed a jacket for the deep woods and headed for the door.  From behind me, she called out for me to wait a moment.

“You’re going to have to carry me,” she yelled.

“You’ve been walking on your own this whole time!”

“Oh no look at these teeny tiny stubby little legs!”

She fell dramatically onto her back and waved them around in the air.

Anyway, I lost that argument, so now I can add ‘losing to a baby’ to my list of accomplishments.  I put her in that weird sling thing and told her that if she spit up on me, I was dropping her.

“You’re not carrying your knife,” she said as we crossed the yard.

“It broke.  I could get the boar spear, I guess, if you’re worried.”

“No.”  Her response came quickly and her tone was sharp.  “That’s not yours.”

“The fairy-”

“It’s not *yours*.”

I hesitated.  The fairy had said I’d need it.  That didn’t necessarily mean that I was the one meant to wield it, however.  My heart sank as I realized there was only one person in my bloodline that was qualified to carry a fairy weapon.

My niece.  The real one.

That’s going to be a fun Christmas present someday.  I’m sure my sister-in-law will be *thrilled* with me.

We headed down into the deep woods.  The changeling honestly wasn’t bad company at first.  She made little comments here and there, about the other denizens of the forest.  She noticed where something had come through recently.  She asked about Beau, how he was doing.  In fact, she seemed particularly interested in Beau, which I suppose shouldn’t be too surprising.  He is unusual in that he’s seeking a name and his nature seems a bit similar to the changeling’s.

They both like causing problems for people, after all.

We’d reached the deep woods and were halfway to the first snow patch on my map when the changeling noticed something especially interesting.  She lunged upwards in the sling and grabbed hold of my ear.  It took very little effort at all for her to yank my head down and over to face the direction she was pointing.  At least I don’t wear earrings anymore.

“Over there,” she hissed.  “See that?”

I looked.  I looked hard.  I was about to say something, that I saw nothing at all, but then I realized… there *was* something there.  Or rather… there was a lack of something there.  I felt like it was pulling at me, a void stretching out its fingers to draw me in.  Hadn’t I felt this before?

The thing in the dark.  When I looked at its face.

I shook myself.  The forest looked normal again, but a sensation of unease remained.  My skin prickled.

“What is it?” I asked.

“A passageway!  Let’s go see where it leads.”

She sounded excited.  I grunted in reluctance, but I grudgingly trudged towards it.

“It leads to the gray world,” I muttered.

“Oh, you know it?”

“No.  But I’ve got a really good hunch.”

Look - I wasn’t about to pass up on the opportunity to drag an inhuman thing into the gray world with me.  I know I have to go there.  If I could do so with someone that at least knows a little more than me about these matters, so much the better.  I marched forwards and for a little bit, it seemed like nothing changed.  The changeling in the sling hissed in excitement, but otherwise there was nothing to indicate that we were leaving the campground.  Not until the sky turned gray and the trees around me stood straight in hues of ash.  It was abrupt.  Like flicking a light switch on.

I turned in a slow circle.  This… was a different part of the gray world.  My heart hammered in my chest.  A *very* different part.  I’d never heard any of the campers that returned from it speak of such a thing.  For while it was a forest, there were no hills in sight.  And from each of the multitude of trees around us dangled a body.

They hung suspended with ropes around their chests, feet pointed at the ground, chins resting slack on their chests.  I tentatively stepped up to one.  He was breathing, but seemed wholly unaware of his surroundings, even when I touched his leg and sent his body gently spinning on its tether.

Hundreds of bodies.  Perhaps thousands.  One on every tree, as far as I could see.

“You said this is the gray world?” the changeling asked.

“That’s just what I call it.  Does this look familiar?  Do you know where we are?”

She stretched out of the sling, balancing precariously on the hem of the fabric and looked intently around us.

“We’re not under the hills.  That’s all I’ve got.”

She collapsed back into the sling and rolled around on her back as if she were just another normal human baby.  She even had the nerve to make cooing noises.

“Seriously?  Aren’t you a fairy?”

“I’m a *changeling*,” she snapped.  It seemed I’d hit a nerve.  “I don’t get to go on grand adventures or ride off to war with the fairy host.  It’s always, ‘oh look at this pretty human baby I want it - you there, go pretend to be an infant for me’.”

I guess changelings are lower in fairy hierarchy.  They weren’t mentioned when fairies ruled Ireland after all, when the fairies were something akin to gods and goddesses.  They came later.

“Don’t get me wrong, it’s great,” she said hastily.  “I get absolutely doted on.  I’m the center of attention the entire time.  And the human child usually gets returned before I have to start taking up any sort of responsibility.”

“And if the parents are… lacking?”

“Rules are that I only have to stick around long enough to fool the parents.”  She smiled and I hastily glanced away from her array of shark teeth.  “If the parents aren’t alive anymore, then I don’t have any reason to stay.”

While this was all fascinating - and a bit alarming - it wasn’t getting us any closer to getting out of here.  I picked a random direction and started walking.  As we went, I explained to the changeling that we needed to find the highest hill.  There, we’d find the master of the gray world and it would hopefully release us from here.  The changeling seemed unimpressed.  She doesn’t seem one for authority, so I suppose that factored into her disinterest in actually finding the master.  She certainly didn’t offer any help, other than to yawn dramatically and complain about how this wasn’t nearly as interesting as she’d hoped.

And as we walked, we saw only trees and bodies.  I kept telling myself that at some point, the terrain had to change.  It had to slope either uphill or downhill and when it did, I’d know which direction to go.

We never reached that point.  Instead, the changeling quietly told me that we were being followed.  I resisted the urge to turn around and instead kept walking straight ahead, not changing my pace.

“By what?” I hissed under my breath.

A long silence.  And when the changeling responded, even she sounded uneasy.

“I think… by your death.”

I didn’t reply.  Every muscle in me went tight and I let out a shaky breath, trying to keep my calm.  I’d been followed by it before.  It hadn’t caught me yet.  I just had to keep going forwards.  Quietly, I quizzed the changeling on what she could tell about it.  What did it look like?  Could she see it more clearly, or was it still just a cluster of lights?  Did she know *what* it was?  Was it the beast, manifested differently in the gray world?

“Look, all I know is it’s your death, I can’t sense anything else about it,” she finally snapped.  “Also, it’s gaining on us, and we haven’t even seen a hint of a hill.”

My heart hammered in my chest.  I fought down fear, frantically slamming shut the doors in the back of my mind before it could boil out and send me into a panic.  I had to be smart about this.  This wasn’t something I could outrun or outfight.

“Maybe we can distract it somehow,” I mused.

“It’s fine, I know a way out,” the changeling sighed.

“You do!?”

I came to a halt between two dangling bodies.  One was close enough to touch.  A woman, in a simple dress and an overdress with straps held on by heavy gold brooches.  Whoever she was, from her clothing it was clear she’d been here for a very long time.

“Yep.  You just make yourself enough of a nuisance that whoever owns the place throws you out.”

“Wait - no-!”

It was too late.  The infant changeling lunged up, leaning precariously out of the sling, and grabbed hold of the woman’s dangling body by the ankle.  The changeling *cackled* as she scaled the woman’s body like some unholy monkey baby.  When she reached the rope, she turned to me and gave me another grin with her shark teeth, her eyes tiny in her wobbling head.  And then she bit the rope in two.

I said I’d drop the changeling if she spat up on me, but I guess some instincts are hard to suppress.  I caught the damn thing as she fell because OH NO BABY IN MIDAIR.  The changeling didn’t seem concerned at all, just rolled around laughing hysterically in my arms.

At my feet, the woman woke up.  She stared around her in horror and confusion, then stared up at me and began to speak rapidly in a language I have never heard before.

“I don’t speak Viking!” I stammered.  Then I held the changeling up in front of me.  “What did you DO!?”

All around us, the forest began to shake.  The trees thrashed violently as if held in the grips of a storm, but no gust of wind touched us.  The bodies danced back and forth on their tethers, sleeping silently amidst the commotion.

“Oh no,” the changeling said.  “I think we made someone mad.”

She didn’t sound remorseful.  She also didn’t sound frightened.  This was all just one big game to her, but unfortunately, I was not a fairy.  I didn’t receive any kind of special consideration from the inhuman world.

The woman grabbed at my legs, crying something in her own language.  I didn’t know what else to do, so I dropped to my knees as well, and she wrapped her arms tight around my chest.  We knelt there, cowering on the ground, fingers digging into each other’s clothing, while the changeling yelled that we were squishing her.  All around us, the unnatural wind picked up, and I knew this was not the wind in the sense I was familiar with.  The master of the gray world was approaching and it was angry at our trespass.

It’s hard to explain what happened next.  Have you ever looked into the sky and contemplated infinity?  Did it make you feel unmoored and adrift, lost, alone, and so very inconsequential?  Did your mind recoil from the sheer breadth of what you were trying to comprehend, as if our minds are not capable of understanding such a thing?

This sensation… this vastness… was the full attention of the master of the gray world.

I felt like I would simply drift away under it and cease to exist.  Become a mere speck of dust, here and gone in the briefest amount of time.

And that damn changeling, squashed between us, just poked her head up and stared directly at the master of the gray world, hanging overhead.

“Neat,” she said.

And I guess that was enough to get us summarily thrown out.

Next I knew we were back in the forest.  We were at the furthest edge with the tattered strips of orange plastic hanging off some branches to mark the boundary.  Beyond the thick row of underbrush was a narrow county road.  I glanced wildly around us to confirm that the color had returned to the world and that nothing else had come back with us.  My forehead was slick with sweat and I was breathing heavily.

The master had ejected just us.  Nothing else.  Not my death.  Me.  The changeling.  And the woman.

But the woman… no longer safe in the gray world… her death caught up to her.

Her eyes were wide and she began to gasp for air, throat bulging with reflexive movements.  It reminded me of a fish.  Brackish water poured from her open mouth, tinged with blood from a split lip.  There was nothing I could do.  Death had come to take what it was due.  The woman drowned in my arms, far away from any source of water deep enough to die in.  It only took a handful of seconds.  Like her lifespan had stretched like a rubber band while she was locked away in the gray world and now, released, it snapped back into form.

She died and then she decayed.  I hastily released her, letting her fall onto the ground as I backed away.  The tissue melted and bubbled into the ground, leaving behind a skeleton covered with scraps of rotting cloth.  Then that, too, was quickly covered up by moss that bloomed and spread before my eyes.  Like watching a timelapse.  When it all slowed down, the only thing that was left visible was the glint of her metal brooches and the trinkets that were tied to them.

“Well that was fun,” the changeling commented, leaning out of her sling.  “What’s next?  Something exciting, I hope.”

“Digging a grave,” I growled.  “I’m not leaving this skeleton for someone to find.”

I buried her with her jewelry.  It only seemed right.  And then I insisted that there would be no more excitement this weekend and the changeling and I spent the rest of the weekend indoors, playing Mario Kart.

...I lost.  A lot.

I’m a campground manager.  I’ve wondered if the gray world was a manifestation of my campground in some way, an alternate reflection of it and everything that occurs there.  But that forest I saw with all those bodies proves otherwise.  They came from all over.  I saw people from all regions of the earth and from all time periods.  I actually couldn’t place a lot of the clothing styles.  I think I understand who these people are.  The master of the gray world offers a choice - stay here and live, or return to the world carrying the knowledge of how you will die.

The woman knew she would die of drowning and so she chose to stay.  I wonder if she would have made the same choice, if she knew it would be spent sleeping.  Perhaps she wouldn’t.  Perhaps that’s why the master threw her out alongside us.

Regardless, this leaves me with a lot of new questions about the gray world and one new concern.  If the gray world is as vast as it seems, if it covers the entirety of the earth…

Then it means anyone can fall inside.  Including you. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

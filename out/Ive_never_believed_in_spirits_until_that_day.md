It started last December when I travelled back home, my mother wanted to retire to her home country and seeing how I was underage she wanted to take me too. Everything was fine at first I attended school made friends etc. it all started when I dropped out of college. I wasn’t understanding the work and decided to take a gap year. This was around March.

I was mostly at home and because everyone else in the house was either attending work or school, a lot of chores naturally fell on me. One of the chores I was given was to sweep the entire front and back garden (it’s made out of cement not grass). To set the scene the front garden was pretty big since all the houses back home are built vertically since there’s more land (I don’t know if this makes sense) but anyways it’s a long job and takes at least an hour but I usually listen to my true crime podcast and get it done.

Another thing to note is my home country is very warm in the middle of the day, like VERY warm. So the best times to sweep outside is in the morning before the sun rises which for me is way too warm OR after the sun sets which was around 8pm. 

On this particular day I had gotten started on the sweeping much later than usual, I was quite tired the whole day and only remembered at 11pm. By the time I went out the front door both my mother and my brother had gone to sleep. The only person awake was my sister and cousin.

I went out and started on it like usual, starting from the back garden all the way to the front. By the time I was finishing up the front garden I could hear a voice call my name. I know it sounds stupid but it was quite deep and raspy sounding not like anyone in the house. I thought it was my sister playing around so I responded by saying “Sister name can you shut up and leave me alone” usually that does the trick. But it continued.

The sound was coming from outside the gate and one thing about my country is we don’t have next door neighbours. Our neighbours live quite far away so there’s empty land between each house. I was intrigued so call me a white girl because I decided to open the front gate. 

I peeked outside hoping to see what’s calling my name and I saw this tall tall figure a good 30 feet away. I could only see the figure and it looked like a woman wearing my country’s cultural clothing she looked about 7 feet tall. And the weirdest part was that when she whispered my name for the third time. It sounded like she was right next to me even though I could see her all the way over there.

By this point I wasn’t trying to die, I slammed the door shut and ran back to the house my first instinct was to go to my sisters room to see if it was her but she was fast asleep. When I told her about the woman she told me I was seeing things and to go to sleep. I checked my cousins room as well but she too was asleep. At this point I was properly spooked and just went back to my room. When I told my mother the following morning I thought she would tell me about some traditional folk story about a 7 foot tall woman who preys on local children or something but she just told me to read my prayers. I still don’t know what it is and nothing crazy has happened since then but I’ve never forgotten her raspy voice calling my name.

Some people here in the UK have been sharing lockdown stories, now 2020 is a couple of years behind us. Mate, do I have a bloody blinder of a lockdown story for you. I had a great life before COVID-19, but not anymore. Only took one government-mandated daily walk to change all that.

I'd started dating this girl on Zoom, right, during the first lockdown. Beth her name was. For the second we decided to join each other for the singular daily exercise outing we were allowed. We met on one of these local support groups, right, the Loo Roll Brigade, on Facebook. It was a Covid thing, there were shortages of bog paper, don't ask. 

I'm telling you, she was a diamond. Eyes sparkled like one, too. Bucktoothed, a bit horsey-looking, but I didn't care about that. She was a posh bird. Some kind of scientist, but not with chemicals or genetics and that, with data and statistics and stuff. If we'd met under different circumstances, me and her would've worked out, I reckon. I ballsed it up proper with Debbie, got hitched too young, that old chestnut. Beth though, she'd have been a wife that stuck. I miss her mate, I do. Hell of a lot.

Last walk we was on I'd bent over to tie my shoelaces when I heard a squeal behind me.

"*EURGH! GRAHAM GETITOUTGETITOUTGETITOUT!"*

I of course went over to see what all the fuss was about, didn't I? She was flapping about in a right state, trying at the same time to pull down her tight face mask, and pat furiously at something behind it. I could hear it soon as I got close, even over her hysterics. A buzzing, loud too. A bug must've somehow crawled up the gap between the draped cloth mask and her collar bone.

"Hold still, would ya?" I said to her, smirking. "It's probably just a moth or summink, hang on."

*"AHHHH Graham I don't like it get it out-ow… OUCH! FUCK GRAHAM GET-"*

She'd been putting on the "*ew a bug"* schtick, at first. She was a Girl Guides leader back in her 20s, and I knew that. She weren't *really* scared of a little insect getting under her clothes. Beth had been hamming it up, right, because she knew I was a bit old school, and liked to be the big man saving the day. She liked that I liked that, even though she needed saving about as much as I've needed hair gel since 2004. What can I say, some of us traditionalists are still out there, even if we are just playing pretend.

It wasn't put on no more when she felt the first hairy twig-thin legs probe half an inch inside her.

I saw the change in her expression, even with the mask. It was instant. The light in her eyes went from the twinkling brightness of new love's playful half-excitement, to the almost-invisible glow of panic at sudden alien sensations. Didn't take me long to pull down the mask. The buzzing got louder soon as the cloth was off her face.

"Hold still woma-GORDON BENNETT THAT'S BLOODY MASSIVE!*"*

I saw it as it was inserting the third and fourth of its dangling daddy long legs limbs into Beth's face. I've never seen any bug like it, mate. The creepiest of crawlies. The body alone was about six inches, the legs sprouting from its front segment another four. It was *at least* the circumference of a pound cigarette lighter at its thickest. Definitely no bloody daddy long legs, I'll tell you that for nothing.

It had ten legs, which don't seem that odd until you remember that, when it comes to legs, what primary school kids collectively call "*minibeasts*" typically have six, eight, or too bloody many to count. Ten is a nice round number, but not when counting the limbs of an arthropod. Yeah, big word that, ain't it, "*arthropod"*? I've been reading books mate. I've had enough time to, ain't I?

The ten legs, four of which were buried in Beth's left nostril up to the third of their seven knee joints, were attached to the head section of its four-segment body. The other three segments, each about a third smaller than the one preceding it, were vibrating. Hard. The buzzing sound wasn't coming from wings - it didn't have none. The noise came from the carapace-covered bulbular body sections chattering against one another, like the beads on the tail of a rattlesnake. I'm buggered if I know how it got all the way up to Beth's neck. Must've jumped, or fell out a tree maybe.

Sorry for all the numbers there, by the way. Third one of this, second one of that, fourth one of them. I like to start by counting out the bits I understand, you see. I need to ease myself into the really weird stuff. I don't get nightmares about long hairy spider legs, even if I did watch four, five, six of them pushing their way into Beth's left nostril. Bluebottle-ish chitin doesn't… *ha,* rattle me, even if the noise was loud enough to make my ears ring after a second or two.

Nah. What's meant I wake up screaming so often they've had to change the guy bunking beneath me twice now, were its eyes. It had three of them on each of the hairy azure body bulges. They weren't compound eyes, not the stained-glass dome of microscopic hexagons I've seen on the Attenborough's. The twelve eyes (sorry, numbers again) on the whatever-the-hell-this-thing-was, weren't like any fly, spider, bee, or wasp that I'd ever seen. They were almost milky white, an empty shade of grey that I'd never come across on anyone living, but I knew where eyes like that normally belonged all the same.

They were human.

Twelve tiny, corpse-like human eyes, each barely over a centimeter in diameter.

*I* squealed then, squealed and recoiled the hand I had ready to bat away the moth or bee or billywitch I'd assumed would be waiting underneath the mask. That's why the twelve-eyed malevolence had time to shove two more prickling limb's into Beth's nose.

"*OUCH! GRAHAM WHAT THE JESUS CHRIST IS ON MY- OW!"*

She must have seen the alarm on my face, because that almost-invisible panic glow I mentioned earlier weren't so invisible anymore. Her dark brown eyes were as wide as I felt my own grow, but I couldn't tell her the reason for my slack jaw and sharp inhale was a trickle of scarlet starting to ooze from her nostril.

"*OUCH! I FEEL -OW- BLOOD, DO I HAVE A NOSEBLEED?!"*

I caught myself nodding before I realized that was the exact opposite response to what I wanted to give. She stood stiff and rigid, arms wobbling out by her sides ever so slightly, whole body tensed in the middle-class picnic "*don't flap about or it will sting you"* pose. She let out a soft moan, and I decided not to give her long enough to begin properly panicking. I could figure out what the bloody hell this thing was *after* I'd squashed it under my boot.

"ARGH! WHAT THE GORDON BLOODY BENETTING HELL!"

It wasn't Beth that yelped in pain this time, but me. She *also* yelped in pain, but that was because the quadrosegmented invertebrate had made legs seven and eight intimately known to her nasal cavity. *I'd* squealed like an eight-year-old because legs nine and ten had flicked at my hand, scratching my outstretched palm so fast I almost didn't notice.

I did notice though. Noticed so hard that machismo-shattering tears welled in my eyes. The burning saw to that.

It was instant - twin streaks of fire flashing across my right hand before I'd even registered the hair-covered wire limbs had twitched. I recoiled again, clutching my wrist in my other hand, staring down at my trembling fingers. The flesh of my palm had been opened by two long, thin, 2cm deep slices. Foam pooled at the edges of the wounds, almost stemming blood that remembered to flow once I'd noticed the wound. If the foam and swelling weren't a clue that the twelve-eyed bug had some kind of toxin in those limbs, the pain was.

It burned more than a wound like that should. I know this because I've opened up the palm of my hand before. I used to work in a kitchen, right? You can fill in the blanks. This was ten times any pain I felt after getting careless with the salami slicer. I'd have cut my arm off then and there if you'd given me a machete.

"*OHSHITTGRAHAMTHISFUCKINGHURTSSOBADICANTMOVE."*

The sound of Beth's posh chitter forming swearwords for the first time snapped me out of the pain-shock trance. The dozen-eyed body had wormed all ten of its hairy spiderish legs into her nostril. Its four bluebottle-ish bodies were slick with the dark wet red of her nose blood. All of it except the eyes, of course. *They* were still milky-white and staring right bloody at me. They'd blinked the deep rogue liquid out with a dozen pairs of miniature eyelids, keeping themselves clear and able to track me in case I hadn't learned my lesson.

Oh, of course I hadn't bloody learned my lesson, had I? What would you do though?

Beth was screaming. One minute we'd been on a nice lockdown-adhering date, the next something she can't even see has ten insectoid legs carving their way up her nose. Her face had started going the same dark purple as my hand, the space around her sinuses ballooning. The buzzing hadn't stopped. I know Beth was acutely aware of that fact too, I bloody would be if I could feel it slowly pulling itself into my nostril.

God gave me two hands, so I used my other one. I wrapped it tight around the rattling body, figuring that it couldn't get at me now its fly-limb legs were buried in Beth. I've never been more fucking wrong.

I think my scream then is why one of the nosy parkers who has a garden backing onto the park called the police. They showed up too late, obviously, but I know it wasn't me that phoned them, and neither Beth nor me made much sound after that.

The acidic seething electricity shot up my left arm the moment my fingers closed. I didn't just recoil this time, I full-on fell over arse backward. Beth didn't. She was still rigid, but now because of the paralyzing toxin in the thousands of hairs lodged both in my left palm and up her left nostril. Doctors told me they're lucky they didn't have to amputate the arms, what with the amount of blood trapped in the swelling and bruises when I came too. They put the swelling in Beth's face down to how many times I allegedly clubbed her with the large rock they found nearby (the one with neither of our DNA on it, not that I'm bitter or anything).

I could feel my pulse rising ten beats per minute every second. I wanted to scream again, but not from pain this time (well, not *just* from pain). This time I wanted to scream in fear - scream from the cold, gut-knotting terror that only comes when an unexpected atrocity dropkicks your future into oblivion right before your eyes.

The thing had pulled the first of its body segments into Beth's nose. I tried to yell, to call for help, but the crippling toxins coursing through my veins from my arm had me locked in place. I was helpless to do anything but watch as the bug forced the fiber-covered swellings of its body deeper and deeper inside Beth. Where it couldn't find room, it made it - slicing away her septum with its deceptive razor twitching until Beth's nose had one singular tube nostril.

However, even this blood-caked orifice bulged and sagged under the pressure of the insect's massive girth. The soft flaps of her nose's rim were stretched to breaking point, the skin red-raw even above the swollen brown-purple bruise cloud. Beth managed to emit a grunt as it shoved its final inches up her face, tears flooding her frozen cheeks.

Then she went cross-eyed.

A trickle of saliva dangled from a corner of Beth's mouth. She was twitching a little. I could still hear the buzzing of the bug-thing but it was wet, moist, muted, and coming from Beth’s ears. Despite my panic I was still straining to fend off the paralysis, to get up off my arse and *help* her. You already know I bloody couldn't though, don't you? They wouldn't have banged me up for Beth's murder if I'd managed to do that, would they?

Beth's eyes crossed further and further until I could see the soft pink flesh of her inner eyelids. Then they went the opposite direction, pushing out in opposite directions so hard her tear ducts bulged and glistened in the midday sun. Her right eye twitched, her mouth bent into a painful-looking angular smile that twisted itself against the toxin's paralysis. A dark ammonia-smelling patch started to spread at the crotch of her jeans, one that almost matched the dark red blooming across her white blouse from the drippings off her chin. Beth made a soft sound. Not a word, not a scream, just a single syllable, almost as quiet as a whisper.

"Eeeeeeeeeeeee."

*I* managed to find a little bit of my own face when she stopped. Not enough to scream either, but enough to whimper and try desperately to close my eyes.

It started at her brow, right between her eyes. Something pushing outward from within, forcing its way into the world. The bulge grew until it had distended her forehead and facial features, making her look like some kind of Neanderthal or one of those offensive pinhead tropes you used to get at carnival freak shows. I don't know the name of the condition. I've been studying etymology in library time, not medicine. Feel free to enlighten each other about the proper terminology - my area of academic expertise is pretty much the insects and arachnids that *didn't* explode Beth's face. Which is all of them, because there's nothing like this out there *anywhere* else.

She'd been making that same monotone "*eeeeeeeeeeeeee"* sound all the way through. Her grin hadn't gone, and I had to pretend I couldn't see the flash of sadness as the tumor-like brow swelling grew to such as size that it pushed her eyes out to the side of her head, making her look like some kind of swamp creature from a black and white horror flick. Thankfully, if she was aware of what was happening even with the damage to her brain by this point, it was all over then.

Beth finally fell to her knees, arms still outstretched like a child trembling while they wait for the wasp to fly off their cheek. She coughed once. After, instead of returning to her monosyllabic note, she waited for a moment while the blood and cranial mulch oozed from her hollowed nasal cavity. I heard a wet cracking, like a boiled egg being crunched into with a rusty spoon. Then I saw the fist.

He made short work of Beth's brow. He punched his way out of her skull in less than a minute, kicking and shoving bone, brain, and eye fragments from his path as he went. By the time he finished the ground in front of her open head was dripping dark red with her cranium's eviscerated contents. The small alabaster figure fell out of Beth's faceless head when he was finished, landing with a crunch on the leaves. Her body slumped over behind him as he picked himself up, dusting the crushed dry almost-autumn plant waste of glistening chunks of Beth’s head from his ivory marble-like skin, tutting.

“*Took me far too long to burrow out of that tomb. 10,000 years,* 10,000 years! *They’d better have left my temple in good condition or I’ll start by eating all the young ones just to prove a-”*

Then he saw me, and froze. Not long, but long enough for me to get a good look at his face. Well, a good look at the part of his monochromatic bald head that mattered, at least. The part that meant I knew straight away where he'd come from (as if it wasn't clear anyway). It was his eyes - his twelve, milky, corpseish eyes. A grin slowly crept across his noseless face, flashing twin rows of hornet-stinger-like needle teeth. He raised a finger to his lips. This was just too much for me to process I reckon. As I finally passed out, the last thing I saw was the twelve-inch man that gave my sort-of girlfriend's face one massive nostril skipping off into the bushes.

Yeah, you bloody read that right. He *skipped.* Like a Bloody twee happy schoolgirl.

I don't know what sort of spirit or demon I witnessed do a messed-up butterfly metamorphosis in Beth's skull. I did get real curious for a few months, but the more distance between me and that event, the less I find ignorance and confusion a problem. What would I bloody do with the information anyway? I'm here now, ain't I? At her majesty's pleasure, Belmarsh.

I've saved up enough good-behavior internet time to write this out. I've been banged up for life - obviously I have, they think I smashed Beth's head in with a rock so savagely that my arms almost exploded. Also obviously, there's not been any trace of the strange little twelve-eyed fucker what actually done it. Nobody believes me, even though I told them. Guess this is my life now, ain't it?

I'd been looking forward to getting back into the world after Lockdown 2. By the time it finished, I was already behind bars. Don't take your freedom for granted - you never know what's waiting to crawl up your nose and take it from you.

I can’t drive alone at night bc it’s like they are sitting in my backseat, watching me, I go to work and I can’t go on the elevator alone bc i’m overwhelmed with this fear. it’s almost like I can hear their steps behind me everyday and this has been a constant thing. i sleep with almost all the lights on in my apartment. i live alone with my two cats. ever since i’ve felt them i feel them watching me when i do anything, and last night i heard them in my head for the first time. he was a man and it was weird. i was in that dream like state, almost sleep paralysis except i was able to move but my eyes were stuck. he clouded my mind with idk this black fog and he started talking but as he was talking i could hear my subconscious saying “stop stop don’t listen to him stop no” but it’s like i couldn’t fight him off and i couldn’t make out everything he said but what i did hear was
 
“i’m gonna take your soul and drag you back to hell where you belong” 

and in that moment, i started praying which i never really do and this yellow light came out of nowhere and it’s almost like he vanished. this morning i texted my mom and told her what happened and she called me crying. i was so confused but she told me that last night herself and my grandma had a dream that i was going to die. she didn’t know how and she didn’t know why but that i was going to die. she told me to continue to pray bc that’s all we can do. i have no idea what to do and i’m worried he’ll come back tonight. i’m so  exhausted but i can’t even go back to sleep. My sister told me it’s bc I used to do magick and I didn’t know what I was playing with and my friends just tell me it’s sleep paralysis and doesn’t mean anything. i’m still very much freaked out and i’m thinking of all the possibilities.

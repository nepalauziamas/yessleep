Theo led us from our building to block B, and as soon as those doors opened, we could tell it was a completely different world from what we'd grown used to. No cells lining the walls, no bare concrete, no madness. It looked like a normal hotel more than anything. Feeling carpet beneath my feet after so long nearly brought me to tears, you never realize how much you'll miss these little things until they're ripped away from you.

Anyway. Theo took us to the infirmary, cause they apparently had one of those as well.

"They'll give you a quick check-up to make sure the two of you are fine, then you can rest until morning."

He turned to leave, but I stopped him. As the only person from block B I sort of knew and trusted, I'd have liked for him to stick around.

"Where are you off to?"

"Still got work to do," he said, half way out the door. "But don't worry, you're in good hands with these guys."

I somehow doubted that, but I went on Theo's word until now so I had little choice but to keep that up. The doctors examined us, and one even tried to make small talk, but we wouldn’t budge. Just kept our mouths shut in case it was a test. I needed some stitches and bandages, nothing major, but Mason would need at least a few days to rest. Like I suspected, he hadn’t broken any bones, but the bruises were huge and he pulled a few muscles.

When they were done with us, they led us to our rooms. Plural, since we wouldn’t live together. They weren’t anything fancy by a long shot, but they weren’t prison cells either. I went to bed right away, falling asleep fast after the madness I’d been through.

Theo woke me up in the morning, with Mason already at his side.

“Come on, I have to break the two of you in.”

He showed us around block B, and it was overall much better than our previous dwellings. It had a canteen with tables to eat at, a gym, a small library with approved books I was sure I wouldn’t frequent. Showers were still commonal though, but I didn’t really care. After he got us new orange jumpsuits, Theo led us to said showers to clean up.

“I’ll join you, last night was a doozie and I sweated like a hog.”

All three of us got stark naked and entered. No one else was there, we had the whole place to ourselves. So I went to find a shower a little distance away from the two of them, but Theo stopped me with a hand on my shoulder. He didn’t say anything, but by the look in his eyes, I knew he meant business. So I followed. He picked out three showers all the way in the back of the room and turned them on at full blast.

“We have to make this quick, they monitor how much time we spend in here,” Theo said all of a sudden. “Keep your voices down. Block B is bugged to high hell and back, but the shower room isn’t. Too much moisture. Closest bug is at the door.”

“You said you have plans for us, so fill us in,” Mason demanded.

He was still wobbly on his feet, and the bruises looked much worse now that some time had passed.

“You two said you want to get into block C and find out the truth,” Theo pointed out. “Well I know the truth, and it fucking sucks. We have to stop it. But I need help, I can’t do it on my own. That’s where you two come in.”

“So tell us, then,” I said.

“No time. You’ll see.”

“And what would you need from us?” Mason asked.

“For the meantime, survive. Keep your heads down. I’m trying to dig up some information, but it’s not easy.”

We looked at each other, contemplating this new wrench thrown into our plans. It was too little information to go off of, but once again I felt like I had no choice but to face the music. Theo picked us specifically for this, and although he didn’t share his plans yet, the mere fact that he had any in the first place could be enough to fuck him over if we ratted him out. If we didn’t accept his terms, if we didn’t play along, we were liabilities to him. And in here, liabilities weren’t tolerated.

"Fine," I said, and turned to Mason. He didn't say anything. "Dude?"

"I only want to find out one thing," he told us. "If my brother is still alive."

Theo's somewhat relaxed expression up to that point turned somber.

"He's been sent to block C?"

"I think so, haven't seen him in either A or B."

"I…hate to break this to you, but…"

Theo didn't finish his sentence. Didn't need to. Mason slammed his fists into the wall and started sobbing, slipping slowly against it to his knees. We’d both known it, Chris and his brother were long dead, but we wanted confirmation. *Needed* confirmation. Yet, now that we had it, I was afraid it would break him.

“I still need an answer,” Theo pushed him.

“I’m in, alright,” Mason said, gritting his teeth between sobs. “I’ll kill whatever’s down there, then I’ll kill the assholes that sent my brother here.”

Theo smirked.

“Good luck with that.”

We washed up in silence, got dressed, and went to grab breakfast. Since we knew the place was bugged, we didn’t speak much. Instead we allowed Theo to guide the conversations, since he was more than likely privy to the no-no topics.

“So what did you two do to land you in here?” He asked us after we sat down.

We answered him, and he batted an eye when he heard my story. But I couldn’t care less, he was here too so he was no saint either.

“You really did *that*?”

“Yeah, well, what did *you* do?”

He sighed, dropped his spoon, and leaned back in his chair. One of his knees bumped the table hard enough to rock it, and I heard something cracking beneath it.

“I used to be a pastor. A man of faith. Had quite the congregation, loyal people ready to follow me to the end. We left the town we’d all grown up in and started our own, away from civilization. I was sure it was about to collapse any day now.”

“And let me guess, you turned it into Waco 2.0 before the feds busted you?”

My remark pissed Theo off, but he continued.

“No, of course not. We didn’t *do* anything, we were peaceful. Didn’t even have guns, we were sure the Lord would watch over us. Until he didn’t.”

“So what, they just wiped you out for no reason?” Mason asked.

“Pretty much. They spouted some bullshit about inciting violence, rebellion, fostering domestic terrorism, but they were all lies.”

“I think I’d have seen something like that in the news,” I pointed out. “Would’ve made all the papers and news channels for weeks.”

Theo chuckled, but it was dry. A hollow gesture.

“It would’ve, if anyone was left alive by the end to say something about it. We were only a few dozen families, deep enough in the wilderness that no one even knew where to find us.”

We wanted to ask him more questions, but he didn’t entertain us any further. He got up from the table, took his tray, and turned to leave.

“I *used* to be a man of faith. But after all of that, after I got in here, after I *saw* what lurks in block C…I couldn’t. The only God is the thing down there, and it wants all of us dead.”

“Well that’s fucking ominous,” Mason blurted.

“You’ll see for yourselves when the time comes.”

He left us after that, and I’ll admit, he really made me doubt our plan. Who the hell just drops those kinds of bombshells on others so casually? We were up against a fucking God? I hated to be *that guy*, but I started thinking that maybe whoever ran the show was right, that maybe keeping it contained out here away from everyone and everything was the right call. If the mother fucking US army couldn’t kill it, what could us three stooges do besides making it worse?

But I kept my mouth shut, of course. Didn’t say a word to anyone about my doubts. If things went south, I could always jump ship and side with whoever I thought was right.

It took Mason and I a while to get used to this new lifestyle. All of a sudden, we had a lot more options and freedom at our disposal, but we didn’t know what to do with it anymore. I took after the others, hitting the gym most days to get in shape for what awaited us. Mason did the same and, to my surprise, he frequented the library as well. My best guess is that the escapism helped him.

There was one thing that didn’t change, however. The wait, the anticipation, living in two month intervals between events. We hadn’t talked much to Theo by the time the next one hit, only enough to know what roles we were supposed to play. Apparently we wouldn’t get guns just yet, for the meantime we were on cleaning duty. Theo and his guys would go out first when the events ended, finding and killing any stragglers. Then they’d escort us around to tidy up the mess and take care of the bodies.

We passed a few events like that, three or four I think. And I’m sorry to just skip through such a long portion of time, but literally nothing interesting happened. Well, nothing more interesting than what came before anyway. It was boring gruntwork. Rake the sand in the yard to cover the blood, carry the bodies of downed creatures to a hatch in block C’s side, and whatever else Theo asked of us. Life wasn’t the best by a long shot, but it sure as shit beat how we had it in block A. It was decent, I could get used to it.

My best guess was that we were waiting for some of Theo’s men to die in order to take their place on his team. They were the only ones with guns, but they could only take them during events.

That chance arose during the fifth event we had as part of block B. It started out normal like all the others, Theo brought us out after his team checked everywhere and made sure it was clear. Blocks A and C were locked back up, and we had a few dead monsters to take care of in the yard. A couple by the walls, and some more scattered about.

Standard procedure was to chop them up into manageable pieces with handsaws, since the hatch we dropped them down into wasn’t large enough to fit a man. Two or three of us would work on a single monster, but it could be fewer if there were a lot of them. Mason and I tended to team up for that, we’d understandably grown close even if you couldn’t tell at a first glance. So we did this time as well.

He got to work on the legs, leaving me with the arms and head if the creature had one. Which this one didn’t, it was a roundish torso with a gaping mouth filled with broken ribs that looked like teeth. We got into position, Mason struck his saw into one of its knees, and the fucker shuddered. Again, something that happened from time to time, they’d play dead to fool us. Theo and co. were supposed to double tap all of them just to make sure, and Roundy did have two holes in it, but like, how do you kill something without a brain?

I didn’t get to warn Mason or call for Theo. As soon as Mason’s saw broke skin, Roundy shot a leg out and pushed Mason away. It swatted an arm at me, but I dodged and took off around it.

“Yo, we got a live one!”

Two of Theo’s men escorted us to keep us safe, and they lingered closeby, smoking and chatting. Roundy took off towards them, but my warning caused them to turn and see it. One dropped his cigarette from his lips and froze, the other one brought up his rifle and let loose a few bullets. They hit Roundy and went right through, but failed to take it down.

“Fuck!”

The guy kept shooting, while his pal turned tail and ran. Roundy reached him in an instant, clamping its fake mouth around his torso. The man twitched, and his bones let out sickening crunches as Roundy bit down harder. A moment later, his body fell away, cleaved in two. Roundy raised its…face? Its fake torso mouth, up in the air, bucking back and forth as if struggling to swallow. I reached Mason and checked on him.

“How are you?”

“Good, it only pushed me away.”

“Awesome, let’s run for our lives.”

There was no point in us fighting, that’s not what we were there for. We had to run away and survive. The guy that ran off would alert Theo and the others, and they’d…

“Ahhh!”

I turned my head around as I bolted, finding the man half-way down Roundy’s gullet as well. It bit down into him and killed him as well, his feet twitching for a moment before life left him. Roundy spat out what it couldn’t swallow and took off after the next closest prey: us.

“We have to kill it!” Mason said.

“How?!”

“I don’t know! But we have to, come up with something!”

How the hell did I end up as the brains of this operation? And more importantly, what the hell could we even do? Those two guys had rifles and it did them little good, we only had bone saws for fuck’s sake. I lifted mine as I ran, looking at the small, sharp teeth lining it.

“That’s it, cut the limbs!”

“What?!”

“Cut the limbs!” I repeated.

“You’re crazy!”

“Well if you have a better idea, let me hear it!”

Mason shot me a glance and stopped arguing. The better idea would’ve been to keep running, but Roundy was faster than us by the looks of it. Help was maybe a minute away tops, yet we both doubted we could escape it for that long.

“How do we do this?” Mason asked.

“Split up. It will follow one of us, so the other rushes back in and strikes.”

“These aren’t fucking swords, you know?!” Mason protested, swinging the saw around.

“Yeah, so hit harder!”

The wall was coming up, and we did as I said. Mason went to the left, I went to the right. Roundy collided into the wall and bounced back like a ball before picking me and taking off again.

“Mason!”

I needed to stop it somehow, to buy Mason time to swoop in. It was risky, but I had no other choice. So I stopped and swivelled on my heels, getting face to face with Roundy. It opened its mouth, wide enough for me to see the top of the heads it had swallowed, and jumped. I dashed ahead as well, getting low to the ground and tackling its legs. Roundy collapsed next to me and thrashed around, still trying to get its teeth into me.

“Legs!” I screamed.

Mason jumped and struck with the saw on his way down. It got Roundy in the pit of the knee, tearing through skin and cartilage before stopping at bone. Mason let go of the saw and stomped on it with his boots, driving it in further.

“Run!” He yelled, leaving the saw behind.

Roundy was getting back up, so it wasn’t a bad idea. But I saw an opportunity and decided to seize it. I let it get on all fours, then kicked its wounded knee with all my strength. It was enough to break it completely and render it useless.

Roundy was slower, but all around more angry after that stunt. It still chased after us, bounding like a dog on three feet. Mason and I split up again, but it took after me once again. Not good since I had the only saw left.

“Take it and hurry!” I screamed at Mason, throwing the saw behind me over my head.

It landed in the sand for Mason to take. I led Roundy around some more and, when I decided I bought Mason enough time, I turned to face it again. This time I couldn’t trip it or get away between its feet, it was too low to the ground for that. So instead I vaulted over it, hoping to make it behind Roundy. But it buckled and got up half-way through the jump, and still in the air, I ended up on its back.

It screamed, I screamed, I’m pretty sure Mason did as well. With my feet right besides its mouth, Roundy turned madly from side to side, spinning in place as it tried to catch them. I’d never been to a rodeo, haven’t even ridden a horse let alone a bull, but I was pretty sure this was close to the genuine thing.

“Mason! Do something!”

“Get it down somehow!”

Yeah, as if I didn’t figure that much out myself. I was growing dizzy, slowly slipping off with nothing to hold onto. But that was my only chance, I couldn’t do anything while straddling Roundy. So I pushed myself off and, still in the air, shot a foot at its other leg. Roundy lost its footing and shot off ahead, propelled by its hands. It landed in the sand mouth first, still screeching.

Mason dashed in, and so did I on all fours. He struck Roundy in its other leg, missing the knee pit this time. But I was right behind him to help add some damage. Mason let go of the saw and ducked, and I vaulted over him, landing on the saw with both feet. It didn’t go through the bone, but it was enough to break it and render the limb useless.

“Okay, let’s go!”

I grabbed Mason’s hand and took off towards Theo and co. Roundy could follow us all it wanted, with only its hands to use for crawling it wouldn’t catch up. We led it to the firing squad, five men side by side with their rifles ready and Theo leading them.

“Get to the ground!” Theo yelled.

We jumped on our bellies, and a heartbeat later, streaks of hot lead passed above our heads. They let loose all they had, emptying their clips and turning Roundy to shreds. Brain or no brain, it couldn’t survive so many holes.

“Thank…fuck…” I stuttered, turning on my back to face the sky as I caught my breath.

“What the hell happened?” Theo asked us.

We gave him the breakdown, told him he was two men short now, then we went back to our duties. Such was life, no time to slow down and process things. We retrieved our saws, and we butchered what was left of Roundy to get rid of it. And yeah, we found the heads in its stomach, but those had to go as well.

Anyways. We continued without other incidents, and wanted to hit the showers when we were done. You know, to clean all of the blood and gore covering us. But Theo stopped us and had us wait for everyone else to go first, so we’d have the place to ourselves.

“What is it?” I asked him after we turned on the showers and got under the streams of cold water.

“I just lost two men, so I’ll propose the two of you as replacements,” he answered. “With what you pulled back there, I don’t think they’ll argue.”

“So we’ll get rifles?” Mason asked.

“Yup.”

“And then what? You said you’re waiting for some info, did you get it?”

“Not yet, but I guess I can share the rest of the plan with you guys.”

So share he did, although he didn’t have time to go into the details. He only told us the jist of it. This place was apparently built on top of a sprawling cave system. It spanned miles and miles of ground all around the prison and it had many entrances, but they blocked all of them off. All, save for the one below block C.

“The prison started out as a military compound in the 60’s. They did whatever the fuck they did down there, and when these things started showing up, they slowly changed things to what they are today. I’m waiting for a map of that cave system so we can go in there and kill it at the source.”

“So you don’t actually know what’s in there? You said you’ve been to block C,” I pointed out.

“To block C, yeah,” Theo answered. “But not down into the caves. No one’s entered them in decades.”

“Well fuck us.”

“Fuck us indeed,” Theo agreed. “But we got this far, we have to try. I have a few more guys on our side, seven of us in total. I’ll get the maps, wait for another blackout event, and we’ll go down there while the monsters are topside.”

And that was it for our talk. No more time for anything else, we had to finish and get out before anyone suspected anything. Lots of questions were left unanswered and I didn’t like that, but I couldn’t do anything about it. All I could do was hope that it would all be worth it in the end.

I’ll skip ahead through some more boring parts, but we got accepted. Theo broke the news to us a week later, and nothing really changed. We didn’t get special treatment or training, not even keys to the weapons locker. Theo would hand those out while the blackout events were going down.

We got a few of those as part of Theo’s team, but Mason and I stuck together and watched each other’s backs. Maybe someday in the future I’ll tell you some of those tales, assuming I’ll survive for that long. For now though I’ll skip them, they’re not relevant or even that exciting to be honest. With firepower at our sides and teamwork, the monsters were all of a sudden much less threatening.

But time went by and, shortly after the two year anniversary of my incarceration, Theo finally got what he waited for. Also, short tangent, yeah the title is a bit misleading. I spent two years and a handful of months in there, but sue me. Close enough.

At any rate, Theo didn’t show any of us the maps. Couldn’t risk bringing them out, or bringing us to his room. He just assured us he memorized them, and that he’d be the last of us to die.

“What if you’re not, though? What if you die first?” I took a jab at him.

“Well, in that case you’re all fucked either way. If the monsters take me down, you lot don’t stand a chance on your own,” he teased with a shit eating grin.

 And that was that, all that was left was to wait for the next blackout event and pray. To whom I don’t know, I’m not much of a believer, but I prayed. Anxiety levels rose across the board as the days passed, not even Theo was immune. He tried to put on a facade, to act normal like it didn’t get to him, but we could all see.

And then it hit. A whole week too early. The events weren’t clockwork precise by any means, it wasn’t two months on the dot, but we experienced discrepancies of only a few days at most up to that point. It caught us offguard and sent us scrambling. Theo gave everyone the guns, and usually we were supposed to wait until the monsters retreated, but this time we couldn’t do that. No, we had to go out in the thick of it, and secure block C under the cover of the mist.

That was the first part of the plan, and the one I liked least. The seven of us who were in on it tensed up, waiting for Theo’s signal.

“Roll out!”

The others, who outnumbered us 2 to 1 by the way, were confused as Theo threw open the main doors of block B.

“What are you…” one of them started complaining.

Theo brought up his rifle and just…shot the guy. Yeah. That’s why I didn’t like this part, even though I understood the logic behind it. We were outnumbered, and they had good incentives to stop us. Anyone that posed a threat had to be dispached.

The bang, and the sound of the body hitting the floor, sent us all into a frenzy. Some ran, others screams, a handful raised their rifles to retaliate against the sudden betrayal. We ran out that door and into the mist with gunfire at our backs, it was a shit show. One of our guys only made it a few steps into the courtyard before a bullet ripped through his chest, so we were already down a man before the operation proper even began.

“Keep running!” Theo screamed.

So we did. Crazy as we were, none of us were crazy enough to stop. We made it to block C, shooting behind us every now and again and wasting precious ammo. The others made it inside, so Theo and I pulled the doors closed behind us and locked us in there. He opened his jumpsuit to retrieve a lock, and I saw square blocks wrapped in paper tied around his torso. Plastic explosives.

“Hey, what the hell?!” I yelled, taking a step back.

“What? These?” Theo said, fanning out his jumpsuit the rest of the way and turning to face the others. “You didn’t think we’d manage to kill whatever’s down there with rifles, did you? I told each and every one of you, this is a suicide mission.”

Some of the others dragged their feet at the unexpected turn in the plan, but Mason approached Theo and stood at his side. With a heavy sigh, I did the same. He was right, we knew from the very beginning we’d die. We accepted that fact along with his offer. I wouldn’t back out. And anyways, I needed to be down there, to hopefully put an end to this if I needed to. I’m a scumbag, always was and always will be, but I won’t put my hate boner ahead of the fate of humanity.

“Whoever doesn’t want to follow, stay back here,” Theo said as he clipped the lock in place and secured the doors. “But once the monsters return, and the other guys catch up, you’ll die anyway. You’ll follow us down there, one way or another.”

“Fuck you, I’ll take my chances here,” someone spoke up.

“Yeah, me too.”

“Count me out as well.”

And that was that. In a single moment, our group got split down the middle. The other three guys backed out, leaving only Theo, Mason, and me.

“At least buy us some time,” Theo said and took off.

We followed him further into the building, into the thick mist that wouldn’t let us see for more than a few feet in any direction. Just like last time, a light from deeper within made all of it shine, and I had my heart in my throat as I waited to see what exactly it was. The ground beneath our feet turned soft and squishy at some point, so I looked down. Flesh. Pulsing and shifting in a steady rhythm, overtaking the concrete.

“What the hell?” I complained.

“Yeah, better get used to it,” Theo said. “It’s like that the whoooole way down.”

“Disgusting,” Mason commented on the matter as well.

The ground sloped, steadily at first and then more abruptly. Some ten feet later or so, as we reached the center of the room, it turned into a pit. Mason nearly walked right into it, but I shot forward and grabbed a hold of his jumpsuit.

“That’s the entrance,” Theo pointed out the obvious.

“Awesome, now how do we go down without breaking our necks?”

He slung his rifle around on his back, and got down on all fours. The tips of his fingers probed the flesh, pushing into it and tearing it apart. I expected blood or something, I’m not sure, but nothing like that came out. It parted around his fingers, and reformed as soon as he pulled them out. Theo went over the edge slowly, striking with his feet and hands to create holds as he descended.

“Don’t just stare, come on!”

I flinched, but I got down on all fours and backed up into the pit. The whole affair was disgusting, the flesh squirmed around my fingers and boots, but it was also illuminating. In more than one way. This is what the monsters needed the prisoners for. Above us, Mason hesitated for a moment.

“You gonna chicken out?” I asked him.

He shook the shell shocked expression off and followed without a word. I was sure this was painful for him to see, hell his brother was likely part of the gore. But it couldn’t be helped, we were on the final stretch. We descended for what felt like hours, though it was only minutes at most. The mist somehow turned even thicker, making the air stuffy and warm. I felt the liquid building up in my lungs the more I breathed it in, we had to move fast.

“Solid ground,” Theo let us know from below. “Well, more or less.”

I reached him first, and stopped to catch my breath as we waited for Mason. The climb wasn’t all that tiring, but the oxygen levels likely plummeted because of the mist. I got on my hunches, hands on my knees as I pulled in deep inhales, and came face to face with…well, a face. A human face. Eyes closed. Mouth agape. Chin bobbing from side to side as it let out a low hum. Strands of light and puffs of mist left its throat every now and again, rising and dissipating as it mixed in with the rest. I wanted to puke right then and there, I was breathing that shit in.

“What the hell?” Theo said out of the blue.

I moved, finding him face to face with another face. The word face will lose all of its meaning by the end of this, I’m sure of it. Mason reached the ground as well, and stepped right into a face too. Then we found another one, and another one, dozens of them lining the floor and walls. We didn’t say anything about it, none of us had any words left in us. Above us, on the ground floor, the sounds of gunshots and pounding on the main door started up.

“Let’s go, we’re wasting time,” Theo ordered.

Mason and I fell in line behind him, and he led us deeper into the cave, hand on the wall to his right to keep his bearings straight. More faces lined the walls, some barely visible contours while others still had necks and even torsos. None were alive anymore by the looks of it, just reanimated by whatever the hell this place was.

“You know, I’ve been thinking,” Theo mumbled at some point.

“Don’t play coy, tell me about what or shut the fuck up.”

He chuckled.

“I lost my faith in God a long time ago. Been in here for about a decade now, and each blackout event slowly chipped at it until there was nothing left. Until my faith was hollowed out and it crumbled away. At first I tried to hold onto it, when I survived six events back to back on the ground floor I thought it could be nothing else but divine intervention.”

“What are you getting at?”

“Being down here, seeing this shit, I’m starting to think it might’ve been divine intervention after all. All of it. Surviving for so long, climbing the ranks, meeting the two of you. Maybe it was all for a reason, for us to see this to the end and put a stop to this.”

“Glad for you, buddy,” I told him. “Now if you’re a believer again, start praying real hard for our asses. We’ll need all of the divine intervention we can get.”

“I have been finding God throughout this entire experience,” Mason chimed in from the back with what I assumed was a joke.

“Yeah, well, let’s hurry up. Those doors will only hold for so long and I don’t want to be alive when they give.”

“Let’s,” Theo agreed and picked up the pace.

We couldn’t exactly run, or even jog, but we hurried as best as we could. The caves got narrower the deeper we went, likely a result of the layer of flesh getting thicker.

“What are we even looking for?” I asked.

“The main cavern,” Theo answered. “Not sure what’s in it, my contact just said it contains the source.”

“Great. Fan fucking tastic. What if it’s a huge monster? A queen of sorts?”

“That’s what I have these for,” Theo said and patted his impromptu bomb vest. “If it’s a monster queen, I’ll start the timer and let it swallow me.”

“Then what the hell are we here for?!” Mason asked.

“Back-up snacks,” Theo joked.

The pounding on the door was almost inaudible at that point, but we could still make it out ever so slightly. It left me wondering what went down up there. Were those three guys still alive? What about the others? What about the monsters?

“You know, speaking of explosives and back-up snacks, it might be a better idea to split them up. Just in case,” Theo said. He opened his jumpsuit fully, and pulled a few of the blocks free, handing them to us. “Careful with them, they’re not C4. If you trip and fall, your ass is toast.”

“Then fucking keep them,” I said, shoving them back at him.

“I said be careful!”

We argued some more as we kept walking, but in the end we kept them. Couldn’t risk playing hot potato with high yield explosives. I wasn’t sure how we’d even detonate them if push came to shove, Theo had the main charge, but he assured us that even slapping them hard enough would set them off. The knowledge that I could turn into human confetti and spread over a wide area at a moment’s notice didn’t set me at ease, however.

“Well, at least it would be a painless way to go,” Mason said. “Better than the alternative.”

Another bang came from up there, one loud enough to reach us.

“They’re through,” Theo said, color draining from his face.

Without another word, he broke out into a sprint. Well not exactly, more of a waddle through knee deep water, but you get the idea. He hurried the hell up. We did the same, careful not to trip and fall.

“How much further?!”

“We’re nearly there!”

And nearly there we were, as the cave started widening again. Only problem was that the monsters were nearly upon us. The slaps of deformed hands and feet on flesh were distant at first, but they approached fast. Unlike us, they knew the place, and they also didn’t have bombs to babysit or worry about.

“Well, I guess this is as far as I’ll go,” Mason said all of a sudden.

He stopped walking, placed his blocks on the ground, and raised his rifle.

“Come on, man! Fuck you, don’t do this to me!”

“What’s it matter? You two will die in a minute as well,” he said. “Just go, I’ll buy you some time. Kill some of the fuckers, and collapse the cave on them.”

He was right, but that didn’t mean I had to like it.

“Guess I’ll see you in hell, buddy,” I said and turned to leave, fighting back tears.

“Yeah, I’ll keep your seats warm. Don’t keep me waiting.”

We split up, so Theo and I rushed ahead. It didn’t take long for gunshots to erupt behind us, and each bullet fired felt like it ripped straight through my heart. I liked the guy, okay? I’m allowed to. But it didn’t last for long, a more powerful bang followed. The shockwave ripped through the air and shook the cavern.

“Fucking,” I let out through clenched teeth.

“Let’s hope it worked, according to the map this is the only entrance. If Mason collapsed it we’re safe.”

The ceilings kept rising and the walls spread further apart, until they weren’t visible anymore. After the chaos behind us ended and the world settled down, we could hear the monsters scratching at something. Loud thuds and thumps. Mason did collapse the cave, but they were clearing the blockage to reach us. He bought us some time, but little of it so we couldn’t waste it.

“We’re here,” Theo said. “The main cavern.”

“And there’s nothing, fucking great! What now?!”

“No, it’s here alright,” he said and pointed at our feet.

I looked down, and my eyes landed on what looked like a black vein embedded into the flesh. It pulsed with light, but didn’t move. I gave it a probing push with the tip of my boot, and found out it was solid.

“Rock,” Theo said, bending down to get a closer look. He ran his fingers over it and broke off a small, sharp piece that cut his palm. “Obsidian. Let’s follow it.”

We did so, heading towards the middle of the cavern as the obsidian vein grew thicker. Before long, we left the flesh behind entirely, stepping on the shiny field of vulcanic glass.

“This is wrong, it’s not native to this place,” Theo said. “No volcanoes for hundreds of miles around here.”

“Maybe it’s ancient.”

“Maybe…”

Ancient or not, it was here. And it went up in a gentle slope, until we reached stairs carved out from it. The whole situation gave me some creepy, otherworldly vibes. Perfect white as far as we could see above our heads, and pitch black below our feet, the contrast somehow fucked with my mind in a way I can’t describe.

“There, I think that’s it,” Theo said from a few steps ahead.

I rushed to his side and froze. We were on the very top of the obsidian pile, but I hesitate to call it that. More of an altar than anything else. It was circular, some ten feet in diameter, and blacker than the night. Blacker than obsidian had any right to be. Symbols I couldn’t understand were cut out of it, in a language either ancient or alien altogether. Each one shined faintly, in different colors.

“A ritual.”

“Yeah,” Theo agreed. “Let’s blow it up.”

“Let’s.”

He turned on the timer, and started taking off his vest. The area was a bit bigger than expected, we hat to spread out the explosives to make sure all of if would be destroyed. The sounds of boulders being moved stopped, so I watched our six. We’d hold our ground up there for as long as possible, until the explosives would go off. That was the plan.

But then the monsters started rushing in. The pitter-patter of feet, first on flesh and then on solid ground. Silhouettes dancing through the mist, like sharks on the prowl through water. I started shooting first. Mostly potshots, but I heard yelps once in a while.

“Hurry up! I can’t hold them back on my own!” I yelled at Theo.

“Almost done, but I have to be careful!” He screamed back, laying down blocks on the other side of the altar. “One wrong move and I’ll set these off!”

I wanted to ask him so what. To tell him that was the plan, and better to set them off early than not at all. But I didn’t get to. With my back turned, one of the monsters rushed past me. In the blink of an eye, it bodied Theo and carried him off his feet. The vest was off and the rest of the explosives dropped to the ground, so I held my breath as I watched them in slow motion. I honestly expected that to be my last breath. 

But they didn’t go off. No bang. Other bangs did come, though, along with Theo’s screams in the distance as he fought off monsters.

“Jack! Shoot the explosives!”

I raised my rifle and aimed at them, but I…I couldn’t. Ready as I thought myself, the survival instinct overpowered me. With my finger shaking on the trigger, filled to the brim with regret, I…I turned tail and ran. Monsters piled Theo until his screams stopped, and I ran. Away from the altar, away from the timer, in no particular direction except *away*.

When they followed me, I shot at them. I shot at them and downed them, until the rifle clicked as the clip emptied. I reloaded on the move, and ran face first into the cavern wall. Then I shot some more. But I couldn’t keep it up forever, they’d overwhelm me.

Then, in an act that finally put the faith of God in me, the timer ran out and the explosives went off. Hard enough to burst my eardrums and deafen me to this day, hard enough to dissipate the mist, hard enough to turn the altar into a crater. I put my hands up to protect my face from the heatwave, but it burned through the jumpsuit.

Still, I somehow survived all of that. Guess God has a twisted sense of humor. The monsters dropped like flies all around me, writhing in agony as they died, and the whole world fell silent. I waited for a while, simply existing and breathing as I tried to come to terms with what happened and the role I played in it. I should’ve died like the others, but here I was.

When even the flesh beneath me started to wither away, turning into a disgusting mulch, I got up. Still had my rifle and the flashlight that came with it, along with the explosives Theo gave me and a few clips of ammo, so I’d put them to good use. Couldn’t go back the way I came, they’d execute me, but I could maybe find one of the blocked off exits Theo mentioned and clear it. So that’s what I did. I searched through the dark for what felt like days, getting further and further away, until I found a slab of concrete instead of a wall.

The explosive did do the job, and with my hearing already compromised, I didn’t even have to worry about it. It blew a hole through the blockade and to the desert’s surface, and I came out some five miles away from the prison in the middle of the night. They likely heard the bang, but by the time they mobilized and came to look for me, I was long gone.

And that’s what I’ve been up to since then. Keeping on the move, staying on the run, trying to remain one step ahead at all times. Not sure why, there’s nothing left for me out here. They did a great job scrubbing my existence from the records, and I can’t rely on anyone either. What little family I have left is better off without me, and I had few friends, none of which were close enough to me to give a shit.

So yeah, I’m not sure why I even decided to share all of this. It’s not a plea for help, or a warning of sorts. More just me screaming my sorrows into the void, hoping I’ll get some form of release and maybe get some gears turning while I’m at it. To preserve Chris’s, Mason’s, and even Theo’s memory. I don’t really have answers, just questions, theories, and nightmares of fog filled caves lined with human faces. But keep your heads up, maybe we’ll cross paths again someday. The one thing I learned from all of this is that you never know what the world will throw at you, for better or worse.

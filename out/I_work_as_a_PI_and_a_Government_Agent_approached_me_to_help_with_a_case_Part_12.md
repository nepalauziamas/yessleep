The next time I agreed to do a case with Nick, it was sudden. I bought coffee before getting started for the day. I had accepted a difficult P.I. job that I wasn’t entirely certain how to approach. Nick parked outside the coffee shop, leaning out his car window to wave me down.  

“Hey Snickers, what are you doing here?” I asked, not expecting to see him.  

He was in s suit so I assumed he could work again. I didn’t think he could handle being bored at home for much longer. His hair much longer from when I first met him. Nickie needed a haircut. It really ruined his secret agent look.  

“A job came up. We can cover your day job with human detectives. I am the only agent free for this task, and I cannot go into the field without a partner. The Corporation is very short on agents lately.” 

I wasn’t sure how I felt about someone else doing a job I’d taken but it did answer my issue of finishing a difficult case I shouldn’t have accepted in the first place. The Corporation really needed to hire more agents or take less cases. Nick and I weren’t a very strong pair. We’ve really been very lucky on every case we’ve done so far.  

“Alright, do I need to call anyone about covering my job?”  

Nick shook his head saying it was already taken care of. With that settled all I needed to do was get into the car. Turns out Nick was a very careful driver. As we went towards our mystery location, a car cut us off nearly causing an accident. Nick didn’t even flinch. I spilled my coffee on my lap and swore. His car looked pristine but I found some napkins in the glove compartment to clean myself up the best I could. My partner wasn’t much of a talker so I just told him a little bit of what had been going on since I’d last seen him. His expression didn’t change but I think he enjoyed listening to what a regular life was like. 

We finally reached a forest park. Nick parked but it wasn’t our final location. He needed to draw a magic circle that would transport us to where we needed to go. I didn’t have any magic powers and Nickie was weak when it came to magic. He used tools already imbued with power, or as he explained, used power from his surroundings. The nature in the park turned out to be very generous when it came to lending magic for agents to use. The Corporation kept the forest clean and well taken care of to repay it.  

So, leaning on some help from the woods, Nick could make a difficult spell he normally wouldn’t be able to use. It took him a while to write all the symbols around the circle. I just watched, unable to assist.  

“What kind of language is that?” I asked, to pass the time. 

“It’s a common one that creatures of the night use. Nearly every one of them can read and write it. Circle spells can be done in any language though. If you had access to a magic marker, or other objects with power, even you could make a spell. Although, you must freehand a perfect circle and most people get stuck on that.” He said as he stepped back to evaluate his progress. 

“So how come you just don’t use English? Won’t it be easier than this language?” 

“This language makes the magic flow better. There is less chance of a blow back if you use it. English should only be used for minor spells. Nothing complex such as this. Also, the wording in spells is the most important factor. It is possible to think around the wording of a spell and make it invalid. I wonder what a good example of that would be...” 

Nick paused to think as I stared at the circle surrounding his car. I never assumed magic would be so complicated. I mean, it’s magic right? It makes impossible things happen without effort. I’ve known Nick for a while and yet I still learned some things. I’d even asked Aberash about magic but she didn’t go into details about it. She must not have wanted to waste the time because I would never be makings spells.  

“An example I can think of is an issue with magic trip wires The Hunters created. They set them up so if the wire was tripped, or snapped it would go off. But they forgot to include the word cut in the spell.  If someone cut the wire, the spell would not activate.” 

Nick got back to work fixing some symbols he wrote in the dirt. I also hadn’t heard much about The Hunters. They were very similar to The Corporation but they didn’t employ supernatural creatures. They would use magic and that was it. Their goal was to kill every creature out there. Both companies tolerated each other to get cases solved. If a Hunter had approached me first, I would have had a completely different outlook on supernatural creatures.  

“So, that other language does it uh, word things different?” I asked and Nick nodded. 

“There is less room for errors if you use this language for spells. I think this spell is complete. Did you... sign all the forms? Even the one that gives your family a lump sum if you die on the job?” Nick said with his voice was still fairly monotone. 

“Nickie... why are you asking that?” I said while nervously looking at the spell he just finished. 

“No reason.” 

I can’t believe Nick lied right to my face. I didn’t think he could do such a thing. I suddenly didn’t trust what he created. But, in the end I should trust my partner with my life. So, what if Nickie wasn’t the best at magic? He wouldn’t risk out lives if he wasn’t confident on his spell work, right? 

We both got into the car. The moment the doors closed our surroundings warped. I felt dizzy and lightheaded. When it was over, we were on the start of a different forest trail. Nick let out a held breath I pretended not to hear. Starting the car, we drove down a bumpy road until we reached a fence and a guard station. 

Nick stopped and waited for a man in a uniform to come out to greet us. Rolling down his window, Nick got out his badge ready to talk. 

“That’s strange, what is a Corporation agent doing out here? And who else is in your car? Doesn’t look like an agent to me.” The guard commented.  

I wore jeans, a plain shirt and a light jacket. I really didn’t look as official as Nick so I didn’t blame the man. 

“A friend.” Nickie said. 

“Temporary partner.” I corrected. 

The friend comment appeared to have just slipped out. I think Nickie didn’t have that many friends and just got excited to be able to say it.  

“We’ve come by to check up on the farm. We suspect they’ve been using automated daily check ins. They have not responded to our last call. If we do not return through this gate in 24 hours, you must call the direct line asking for back up agents.” 

The guard whistled at Nick’s request. He looked beyond the gate and into the sea of trees. It looked to be the most interesting thing he’d ever been asked to do on the job. 

“Alright I got you. But I doubt anything is wrong. I haven’t heard or seen anything."

“I hope this is just a case of neglect and not the alternative.” Nick said in a somber voice. 

I didn’t know what was going on, which was pretty normal. Checking my side, I had a terrible realization. I didn’t have my gun. Nick picked me up from the coffee shop and I don’t carry it on me besides for cases with him. I would bring it up after. I did live through a few cases without it so hoped it wasn’t a big deal. 

We were let through the gate. The road extra bumpy and impossible to talk while driving. I needed to wait until we stopped before asking what the case would be. Finally, we reached what looked to be some sort of very small town in the middle of the forest. A spot for a few parked cars out front and one main street. I didn’t see any signs of life. As we got closer, I could see why. The cars had open doors and trails of blood leading from them. It was as if someone tried to get away from something and failed.  

Nick parked and got out of the car not appearing too nervous despite the sight of blood.  

“What is this place? What happened?” I got out to join him and looked over the ruined area. 

Windows and doors were broken. More blood on the dirt roadway but no bodies to speak of. Whoever lived here might already be dead by now. Aside from taking care of whatever monster did this, it looked like we arrived too late to help. 

“Sadly, it's what we feared. This place raises a certain type of supernatural creature to be butchered and be used to create magic objects or weapons. It's not often that-” 

His words were cut off when something came out of a building and into the light. Smoke poured from the creature as if the sunlight burned it. It spotted Nick and headed right for him screeching. Without a weapon I couldn’t help. Calmly, Nick drew his sword and a familiar sound rung. With one swift movement, he cut the creature in half, the shockwave from his sword travelling down the road scarring the road. He replaced his sword into the sheath and for a moment, looked like a badass agent. I looked at the creature’s body, not believing what I was seeing as it smoldered in the sunlight. 

“Are we dealing with vampires?” I said in a low voice. 

“No. Why do you ask?” 

I looked between him and the giant bat like creature burning from the sunlight. I tried explaining but he didn’t understand. All vampire media hadn’t reached him, and because there were so few vampires left, he had never faced one. I was positive that bat creature was a bloodsucker from everything I’d seen, but Nick got ready to explain.  

“They’re known as Velvet Bats. Through genetic manipulation they’ve become this size. They are simply large bat creatures, but they attack in swarms so it is easy to become overwhelmed. The Corporation and The Hunters created farms like this to raise them because they are the creature that gives out the most amount of magic through the harvesting of their body parts, compared to the effort to raise them.”

I think I’ve heard at some point supernatural creature body parts are used as magic tools. The magic marker Nick used for his smaller spells may contain blood of some creature as a power source. I looked over at the carnage that had long since occurred and felt sorry for both the humans that lost their lives, and the bats raised to be slaughtered for parts.  

“You mentioned at the gate that they were using automated daily check ins. Is that why no one knew this place was attacked?” I asked trying to understand how this could have been avoided.  

“Are far as we can tell. These farms are built far away to ensure if the bats do get out, it takes them a few days to reach a city or town. The ones running the farms must check in everyday so the Corporation knows if something like this happens. It’s a paid position to keep people motivated not to slack on the task. I fear the one running this farm used an automated system to save money. That bat we saw... They should not be awake at this time let alone go into the sun. I suspect these bats were modified past The Corporation limits to create larger feral creatures that produce more materials when harvested.” 

All of this happened because someone got greedy? I hated to think that was the case but it appeared to be the most logical assumption. Now that I knew a little bit more about what we were dealing with, Nick told me the next step to be cleaning out the place of any remaining bats. There was a good chance nearly all of them fled into the forest before the sun rose because their food supply ran out.  I got told to stay behind and keep watch. Nick doubted there was going to be anyone left alive. He didn’t want to put me in danger of a random bat attacking from a building, and he didn’t want me to see any of the gory remains of the people who worked at the farm. I felt fine staying behind but didn’t get to tell him I was unarmed. Nick was running off down the main road, hand at the ready in case he needed to draw his sword. 

For being one of the weaker agents, Nick was pretty impressive. I waited near the car and watched him easily take out any bat that lunged from the dark. There clearly wasn’t anyone left to save because he let The Orchestra loose on the buildings. I felt the shock waves of each swing from where I was standing. Debris exploded out after he directed his sword in any direction. These buildings would need to come down to make sure the bats didn’t have anywhere to hide. He did a good job of that.  

A hissing noise made me turn to see a bat crawling on all fours closer to the car. It spotted me and started to hobble closer, drool dripping from its large mouth. Smoke poured from its body where the sun hit it, but the creature didn’t appear to care with food right in front of it.  

“Uh, Nick?” I called out, not taking my eyes off the bat.  

It got closer, inch by inch. I kept stepping back hoping that it didn’t decide to go faster and bite my face off before Nick swooped in for a rescue. I didn’t have any kind of weapon. Not even a big stick to try and swat it away. I called out for Nick again and the beast launched off the ground, screeching and wings outstretched; I could only shield my face praying a miracle would happen. At the last second, a razor thin blade of wind sliced off the bat’s head from its body at a speed almost too fast to see. The body kept flying and I stumbled over my own feet. I fell to the ground and the rest of the bat sailed over me to crash a few feet behind.  

Nick used the shockwave The Orchestra could produce to save me at a distance. He came jogging up looking worried over the close call.  

“Why didn’t you shoot it?” Nick asked as he offered a hand to help me get up. 

“I didn’t have my gun when you picked me up, Nickie.” I said, accepting the help. 

An almost startled look came over his face and he tensed up. It looked as if he had forgotten to turn the stove off.

“Oh, you’re right. I have something for you. I forgot to get it, one second.” 

He hurried over to the car to dig around in the backseat. After finding what he wanted, he came back over with a few items in his hand. One was a belt of pouches with a holster on the side, and the other was a handgun. I didn’t know much about guns but I assumed it to be some sort of 9mm that used magazines. But I could be wrong. They all looked the same to me. The gun was unloaded and Nick didn’t hand it over yet. 

“We had this made for you. Four of these pouches have a spell that connects to the gun, it can sense when the gun is empty and can automatically reload it for you. Like, teleporting the magazine in place. Like this.” 

He brought the unloaded gun near to a pouch with a magazine stored inside. A set of identical circle spells glowed on the pouch and the gun. A click echoed and the magazine suddenly appeared loaded. This would be very useful. But why did only four pouches have the spells on them? I asked Nick and he continued on explaining.  

“The spell is more complicated than you would expect. It takes a lot of power to recharge, so we were only able to get four prepared. But you have two more regular magazines. Four automatic reloads, and two manual reloads.”  

“Three now.” I corrected. 

Nick paused staring at me, the fact he wasted an automatic reload on an example sinking in. His eyes darted to pouch in his hand fretting over his mistake. 

“I suppose I could have just told you.” 

I could have given him a hard time but decided against it. An honest mistake. I took the pouch belt, finding it wasn’t a nerdy as I thought it might be. I double checked the safety and went over the gun a few times because it was a model I’ve never handled. Nick held back a magazine so he could take a bullet out to show it off. Aside from it being a dark red, it appeared normal. Another bat was eyeing us from the woods. Along with a few more starting to peek through the ruined buildings. I felt tense from their stares even though I now had a gun at my hip. 

“These bullets are magic infused. I made them while I wasn’t working. However, I am not skilled at creating items like this. Some have more power than others. Try shooting these bats as practice. I’ll ensure they won’t get close.” 

With that encouragement, I pulled the new gun from the holster stitched into the ammo pouch. Triple checking to make certain the safety was off, I lined up the shot and fired. The first missed. The next shot hit its mark, but a weak bullet. The third hit, and exploded the bat’s head. I jumped and swore at the sight. The other bats scurried back hiding for the moment. I never expected the bullets to be that strong.  

“Jesus, Nickie what did you use for these?” I asked, still a bit stunned.  

“Some of my blood.”  

Another unexpected answer. I looked at him trying to picture my partner sitting at home by himself, bleeding to create a weapon. I did not enjoy that mental image in the slightest.  

“How much did you use? How are you still standing, I mean there are six magazines here.” 

I would have never thought Nick’s blood and body parts could be used the same way as the bats. He wasn’t human after all. Aberash told me that Nick didn’t have that much magic. For him to create so many bullets he must have gone through a lot of blood.  

“Only a drop. I do not have a strong internal magic source, but for some reason my blood, and other body parts are so high in magic content it’s difficult to control. Even the most powerful creatures in The Corporation cannot maintain control of the outflow to put it to use. So far, one has died from magic blowback and several were injured. As far as I can tell, I only succeeded making these bullets because I was fusing knowledge of Alchemy and magic.” 

Some more bats got confident while Nick spoke. They skittered from the buildings trying to get close. Some were bigger than myself while others looked to be about the same size of a large dog. The sunlight burned their skin so they either didn’t notice the pain, or were very hungry. I fired off a few more shots, getting slightly better at hitting my targets. Aside from getting some shooting practice in, I was learning a lot about how magic worked.  

“You’ve mentioned blowback before. Is it really that bad?” I asked keeping an eye out for any surprise attacks from the creatures that were still hiding. 

“Yes, it can be. It happens when someone attempts to use more magic than their body can handle. It’s the reason why we cannot heal you in the same way we can heal the supernatural agents. Humans have a low magic tolerance. A healing spell may fry your nerves, or kill you.” 

I’ve heard that before. It was the reason why there was a scar on my face from the twin lizard case. There were some medicines that could have fully healed all my injuries, but The Corporation didn’t have any on hand at the time. Aberash apologized saying they didn’t hire very many humans so didn’t notice when the supply ran out. It also takes a while to harvest the ingredients so she was unaware of when more could be made. Being a human working for a mostly supernatural-run company sure did have a lot of weird drawbacks.  

A smoking bat took at least four bullets to take down. Each bullet did have different power levels. Some took out a bat in one hit, others needed a few. What would come out of the gun next completely random. Nickie did say he wasn’t all that great at making stuff like this. I just hoped the more powerful bullets would come out at the right time and that a whole magazine weren’t duds. Even the weaker bullets did damage, but I didn’t want to be in a situation where Nick wasn’t around and I was facing more than one bat with a weak gun. 

“There really is a big difference in bullet strength.” I commented. I’d only killed a few bats but I had already emptied a magazine. Nick needed to help show me how to manually reload a new one. 

“I did not test them out beforehand. Although, I’d hoped even the weaker ones would be more powerful than this. I’ll be sure to adjust the amount I place in each bullet for the next time. There are two mixed in I was worried would be too powerful. I believe you already fired one that exploded the first bat you killed. It appears I was too nervous and severely underestimated what I was making.” 

Well, at least we learned something from this, so he can adjust how he makes the bullets and the amount of magic he puts in them for the next job. I was pretty much done practicing and wanted to leave the rest up to Nick. With his sword he could take out all of the bats and the buildings in a short while. Then we would go after whatever bats had fled into the forest before leaving for the night. There were an unknown number of them and he didn’t want us to face them alone. We could not face what could be an army of those creatures at night. Coming back in the morning with backup, or even without it, was the plan. 

Turns out, that wasn't in the cards. One of the bullets Nick was worried about was not fired yet. I’d missed the bat closest to me, located in a ruined building, and the bullet hit something else nearly at the end of the dirt road. That may have saved our lives. I couldn’t react fast enough, I just saw a flash of white, then nothing besides a ringing in my ears. I wasn’t even aware we both got knocked out and blown back until I woke up, body aching and ears still ringing.

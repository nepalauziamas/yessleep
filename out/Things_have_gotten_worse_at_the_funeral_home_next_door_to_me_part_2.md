Ever since I heard those strange noises from the funeral home as well as from underneath my own floor boards, it’s gotten significantly worse. I had since then been looking for a new apartment but honestly it’s been really difficult finding a new place in the same price range especially with how busy I’ve been at work. I think once I save up enough money I should be fine and I can figure out what to do from there. There is, however, a new problem. I am petrified with fear right now and I know what I have to do, but I also know that man was never meant to go down there. There are some places we were never supposed to be and one of them is right underneath this neighborhood. 

I want to catch everyone up to speed on a few details from the last couple months I didn’t mention. I need you to know what it has been like. The strange noises have continued. The whispering, the scratching, it’s increased in volume and frequency. They know I can hear them. I’ve taken to sleeping with a knife on my bedside table. I’ve heard their dog laughs from their man mouths. 

Sometimes I smell blood if I get close to the floorboards. Other times I smell something else, the kind of smell I only smell when the door to the funeral home is open. 

Another detail: in the past year I’ve been living here, I’ve had things go missing. Never anything big. Innocuous stuff: an umbrella, some sunglasses, a belt, a few dvds. All of this is stuff I could have lost somehow. The dvd’s could have been left behind in the move somehow, the umbrella left on a bench, the sunglasses misplaced while outside. But here’s the thing: I didn’t misplace them. All of those things had set locations in my house I would usually put them at. There was no way I could have lost them! 

 I needed to know more about this neighborhood. I needed to know what was really going on. I decided one day to speak to my upstairs neighbor, the older man who lived on the third floor. I knocked on his door and introduced myself. He was a stout Ukrainian American named Ivan and he spoke in a muttering whisper so that I didn’t catch his words the first time he introduced himself. His apartment was dark and I hesitated to enter when he invited me in. It was a damp and musty place, full of weird old books. There were crucifixes on every wall, not one to a wall but multiple. The sink was full of dishes that looked like they had sat there for weeks. Flytrap paper hung from the ceiling and the peeling yellow wallpaper. The windows were covered by cardboard and newspapers taped over the glass allowing in only a few beams of light. This was a hoarder's apartment. 

When I entered he bolted the door behind me with not one but four bolts and I wondered what I was getting myself into. Despite it, I knew I had to continue to gain some level of closure. I never gained it. What knowledge I learned has only made my sleepless nights worse. He sat me down in an armchair in the living room that’s wood groaned when I sat in it. I remember that a cloud of dust shot up from the cushions. I took it to mean that he didn’t have company often. His coffee table was covered in yellowed copies of the New York Post, one of which stated on its cover that Rudy Gulliani had been elected mayor. There was a ceramic bowl on the table filled with a strange yellow liquid I did my best to ignore. There were also a few framed black and white photographs of a family on a cobblestone street, and a young man with some similarities to my host. I asked him how long ago he had come over to the states and in his mumbling way he told “91”.

He explained that he had lived in my apartment in the 90’s. The basement one. I was shocked. I asked him if he had heard the strange noises as well. I asked if he had had things go missing. He could see he was all knuckles and sinew. He sat down and got very close to me then. He gripped my shoulder painfully tight with his bony old hand. I could smell his breath and see his mouth of rotten teeth as he explained that he had. His voice lowered even further down from his usual whisper and I had to lean in to hear him. There was more than fear in his eyes, there was terror. He told me he had changed rooms after living there for only a few months due to an incident in the building next door to the right. 

To the right. He was talking about the abandoned building, not the funeral home. I asked him to go on. He looked like he wanted to cry but he did so. 

The story he told was as follows: That the abandoned building back then was as ours is now, sparsely populated, run down, but alive. At least, until an entire family went missing. Their basement apartment was found ransacked, blood everywhere, but no bodies. The crazy thing is the apartment was locked from the inside. No way in, no way out. A lot of people moved out of the neighborhood after that. 

I asked him if he knew anything about the woman who ran the funeral home. Had she been around way back then? At that point he lost it. He started stuttering. He gripped my arm so tightly it bruised the skin. He started rambling and told me that he wouldn’t talk about it. He screamed that they were listening, always listening, and that I had to leave, move out now before it was too late. If I knew about her then she for sure knew about me, he said. There was the fear of death in his eyes. 

I was terrified, I didn’t know what he would do next. I told him I would leave. He asked me to promise not to tell anyone what he had told me. To never speak of it. He wouldn’t let go of my arm until I promised. As I got up to leave he slumped down. He seemed like he was thinking things over. 

Slowly, hesitantly, looking almost defeated in his eyes, he told me she had been around during the disappearance of the family, though she was only a child then. In those days the funeral home was run by her father. He was the kind of man who kept to himself, and though people said he had a wife, Ivan had never seen her. The only real evidence of the existence of a third member of the family was the child, who quickly began to show an interest in her father’s work. 

As I left he got down on his knees and began to pray quickly and profusely. 

Some time later, I was meeting an old friend downtown. I needed to get away from that neighborhood and out of the house and I hadn’t had a gig for a few days so it was becoming unbearable. She was an old friend from college I still keep in touch with who's really into architecture and the 

history of the city. We went to this cool basement bar together and I told them about what had been happening to me. It was nice to get out but she did comment on my weight loss and the dark circles that had grown under my eyes since we last met. I explained to her that I had had trouble in my new apartment with strange noises and smells. 

I am, of course, in one of the older areas of the city and she was able to give me some history of the area. Apparently the neighborhood used to be home to a pretty major cemetery before all the bodies were cleared out to make way for the construction of the nyc subway system. See, the Q train in Manhattan ends at 96th street. What was envisioned would have brought it up across where Central Park is now all the way into The Bronx. And what they did construct of it went right under the street I’m on. The branch of the system under this neighborhood, however, was never completed. It never happened. Structural issues, they say. 

My theory is that whoever took them didn’t come down from above into the basement to go after the family. They came up from below. Some kind of trap door or secret passageway or something into the apartment from the subway system. Maybe a maintenance tunnel? 

When I told her everything, including my theories, I didn't think she believed me. She told me she wanted to check out the abandoned building, take a look. She was laughing the whole time. I refused. I told her it was too dangerous. If there was a way into those tunnels, it isn’t a place people should be. On my way out of the bar I noticed a strange figure standing by the entrance. He wore a long dark overcoat and a hood. He was a distance away down the street, crouched down in the shadows on all fours but I could tell he was staring right at me. 

On the ride home I swear I saw the glow of red eyes through a passageway the train passed through. 

When I got home, I began to hear noises under the floor like I had before. I grabbed the knife, shut off the lights, and got up on top of the couch. The scratching didn’t stop. I thought I heard a whisper. It was moving, closer and closer. I could hear wood and metal creak as whatever it was moved right underneath the couch. I held my breathe. At any moment I thought it would rip through the floor and pull me down into the dark. But it didn’t stop there, it continued. The wall shook as plaster fell from the ceiling behind me and I leaped off the couch. I could hear it breathing as it climbed up the crawl space inside the wall up to the floor above me. I remained frozen, completely still on the floor until a scream rang out through the apartment followed by a gunshot and another scream and then silence. It could only have been Ivan. 

I heard yelling in the stairwell coming from the family in the fifth floor, echoing down. A man’s voice cried out to call the cops. With a loud bang whatever had come up the crawlspace launched itself back down. I heard a yelp like a dog but also like a man as it fell. I called my friend and I asked her to come over. I was too terrified to be alone and I didn’t dare try to go outside in case whatever it was was out there. 

By the time she texted me she was only one more stop away a cop car and an ambulance were outside. The detective who I had spoken to previously was there. Ivan’s body was on a stretcher. His throat had been torn out!

People go missing here all the time. People going on late night walks home from work disappear. Sometimes people get murdered.

I decided I didn’t want her to have to walk the dangerous streets alone and raced over to the subway station. I ran the whole way. I passed the alley beside the funeral home. I didn’t dare to look. 

When I arrived the train pulled in. We made eye contact as she picked up her purse and dropped it. The lights in her train car flickered. Her items spilled across the floor of the train. As she bent down to pick them up the doors to the train closed. She looked up at me with surprise. My eyes stayed on her as it happened. Walking in from another car behind her came a man dressed in a black trench coat and a hoodie. He wore a face mask and despite it being night he was wearing sunglasses. He was wearing my sunglasses!  His face was pale, pallid. It was so white it looked like makeup.  Whatever that thing was, it wasn’t human. 

I watched as he grabbed my friend. He pulled her to the ground. She screamed silently through the glass as the train began to move once more, leaving the station. I tried to chase it, tried to yell for it to stop, hoping anyone would hear me, but it was too late and there was no one there but me.

I raced back to my apartment. The police were still there. I yelled to the detective to stop the train, to save my friend. He recognized me. I told him what I had seen. 

I know what I saw. 

They tell me now they stopped the train at the next stop. This time of night, no one was on it except a drunk. There was no sign of a struggle. They threatened to arrest me for wasting their time! I know what I saw. I’m not crazy! You know how I know? Because after the police left I got a phone call. It was a woman’s voice. She told me:

“Whoever you tell about us will die. This is your only warning. Don’t come looking for us. We’ll be watching”. 

I know it was the funeral director’s voice. I know my friend is probably dead but if there’s a chance she’s still alive I have to help her. I’m going to go down into the basement apartment of the abandoned building next door to try to find the passage into the tunnels. 

If I make it out alive, I’ll send an update.

Mother used to say I was given a gift. That I was special. That I had magic in my veins. Cut to seventh grade, and she is yelling at me for getting an F on an assignment. Yeah, my ass is *very* special indeed.

I swear I try my best at school, but I have some learning disabilities. I am dyslexic, so I could only rely on the teacher’s voice to learn, because if I tried to read from the board or from my book, it became pretty much a soup letter. I am also autistic, but I don’t get overwhelmed too easily and if I have my dice with different sensory objects and stimuli, I’ll be just fine. I couldn’t do classes for differently-abled students because my Mother and I were struggling a bit financially. So I just had to suck it up and take it, even if it was an F thrown at my face.

I also space out quite frequently. Imagining myself soaring above the skies. Day dreaming. Did I say my teachers absolutely hate me for that?

Either way, it all started when those strange twins enrolled in my school. They were identical so they couldn’t be mistaken for anything other than family. I was seventeen because I’d been held back for “stupidity” (I mean, fuck off), and they too looked older than ninth graders. Both of them were tall, and had blank expressions on their faces. They murmured something, probably their names, when the teacher asked them to present themselves, and sat right at the back of the room, like the least interesting thing for then was learning about history. To be fair, I felt the same, but if I didn’t pass *again* my Mother would have my liver for dinner.

I looked quickly on their directions, trying to disguise my intentions with a finger brush of my hair. My cheeks got flushed immediately: they were staring right at me. I unfocused and turned back to my book. There was something about those stares that really unsettled me. I was grateful I only had history class with them.

To add to the creepiness, in the first week that they were at school, they never ate. They had this unfocused, blank eyes unless they were sneaking a glance at me when they thought I wasn’t looking. I might be bad at school, but I could see they were trying to say or do something to me.

In the next week to their introductions, I sat at a table alone (I usually get surrounded by squirrely 15 year old girls but I’ve been this age, so I let them be as annoying as they want). As soon as the scripted glance happened, I waved and gestured them to sit in the empty table with me. They were so tall and awkward, it took a while to get from one way of the cafeteria from another and I could get a good view.

The boy was tall and lanky, with white snow skin and messy black hair almost in constrast. His eyes were dark chocolate, gazing directly into my soul. He didn’t smile or say anything, didn’t even sit. He looked more like a bodyguard than a twin.

The girl was the same, pale skin with dark hair, more curly than her brother’s. Her eyes were also dark chocolate, and she seemed to have a better disposition than her angry brother. She smiled, and her teeth were an immaculate white. Even through the awkwardness, I could tell they were above beautiful.

“Hi, Isa!”, the girl said cheerfully.

“Uh, it’s Bella. How do you know my name?” I blurped out. Great, now I’m more awkward than the both of them combined. Nice going, me.

“Oh, sorry Bella. I’m Alyssa, and this statue right here-“ she have a friendly slap on her brother’s arm. “-is Henrique. We were dispatched to protect you.”

I stared at her, eyes wide. “Protect from who?”

“Not who. What”, Alyssa looked at the windows leading the cafeteria back to campus. “You are pretty famous on our world, and with you turning 18… things are in a bit of a turmoil.”

I felt dizzy from all the information. Me? Famous? The girls who couldn’t even pass fourth grade? I think my brain stopped working at that moment, because all I could manage was a “uhh uhuh”. I searched for the dice in my pocket.

“So now we gotta take you back. Give you what is your birth right. You’re the one who will lead us.”

I gulped, still very much overwhelmed. “I am going to lead what and where now?”

Henrique intervened, his voice softer than I expected for a guy with such an angry demeanor. “Did your mom ever said you were special? Magical?”

I remembered the old days. “Yes, she always said that.”

“Well, it’s not bullshit. You *are* magical, but you never had the chance to learn how to use it.”

“Oh, c’mon!” I said sarcastically. Plenty of mothers say that to their children. Right?

Alyssa leaned over the table and whispered to me. “Name, Isabella Evangeline Young. Age, 17 years. Gets held back in school because your brain is simply not wired to function in English. Favorite hobby, crotcheting. Favorite shirt, an ice cream cone. Last love interest—“

“Okay, I’m convinced, don’t say anything else please!” I pleaded while Alyssa chuckled. At this point I could feel the warmness of my face, meaning I should be beet red. It’s very hard to hide your emotions when you’re a ginger.

“You have to lead us into battle. It is in the prophecy.” Henrique chimed in.

“I’m sorry, I’m totally convinced that you know your stuff but… *What* war? Who are us?” I asked, still confused.

Alyssa smiled again, her pristine teeth seemingly a bit more pointy than before. “Oh, the demons. We are demons. And we will depose The One Above.”

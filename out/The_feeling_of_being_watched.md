Have you ever felt this feeling of not being alone? If you do not know how it feels, it's almost like having a cold knife blade against your neck. Not pressed hard against your skin but just lightly touching so you are aware that it is there. For a while now I have felt that feeling several times during the day and even at night and I do not know if I can handle it anymore. It started several years ago when I started to get an uneasy feeling at different times, the feeling of being observed. At first I waved it off because I never believed in ghosts or the supernatural. Or I have always been fascinated by the idea but have never been completely convinced. But it did not disappear. That feeling, it was still there and it reminded itself more and more often. 

It was not long before I began to see things, just out of my sight. A jumping rabbit creature, a shadow running over an open feld. But as soon as I turn my gaze in that direction, there is nothing there. I tried not to think about it, ignoring the strange visions. 

I lived with my family during that time because I was not of legal age yet and I just want to give a little description of the house. There are three floors. Upstairs, where my younger brother and I live, there are two attic spaces, one is in my brother's room and the other is right outside mine. Then we have the middle floor, the largest. There is a kitchen living room and my youngest brother's room. My parents' room is also there but it's not that important really. Directly when you get inside the front door, there is a staircase down to the basement. It's pretty low for a while and I hit my head almost every time I went down for it. Directly to the left is a shorter corridor that leads into a TV room where we siblings used to have "cozy evenings" with friends. If you instead go straight ahead when you come down the stairs, you enter the laundry room and then my sister's room.

As I said, I have had problems with the feeling of being observed and also of seeing things right on the border of outside my field of vision. It could be that you saw a dark figure at the far end of that corridor in the basement or that you heard strange scraping sounds from the attics upstairs. I did not really bother with it, it just gave me a little feeling of discomfort but that was really all. It was not like anyone had tried to kill me yet. So I just let it be. 

Time passed and soon a few years had passed and it did not disappear. Instead, I began to see more and more "ghosts". But it was not the strangest thing, I also began to hear things. A silent whisper of my name. Sometimes it could even be like a shout. What was strange was that no one else seemed to hear it. It was just me and the voices. I did not tell anyone about it for what it would serve. People would just think I was crazy. But now I'm sitting here, in my own basement, in a house in northern Sweden, writing this. The voices never got quieter, they talk to me. I see them moving everywhere. They never really get quiet .. See this as my last words. For now I will rest. I have isolated myself from the outside world so do not come and look for me. If you still get yourself to come up here, do so at your own risk. They will find you. They will whisper in your ear. We will make you do crazy things.

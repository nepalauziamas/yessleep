These bastards are murderers.

Sorry, it’s taken a while to update you. So much has happened—and I’m still paranoid we’re being tracked.

Forget everything you believe about Disney.

Somehow.

…

…

…

Concussion is weird. I’ve heard it feels a little like dancing with no music on a floor made of clouds.

At least that’s what my eight-year-old cousin said, when he fell out of his treehouse.

For me, it wasn’t quite that. Though I do remember not being able to comprehend 99.9% of what was happening.

When reality came back into focus, I found myself with no memory in a large room resembling an operating theatre. Tied back-to back with Zach.

The two of us sat on a medical bed under a futuristic scanner which, thankfully, hadn’t been turned on yet.

“Well.” Zach whistled. His hands entangled with mine, bound with tough rope. “Are you regretting your rescue mission now?”

Instead of answering, I fought to piece together the last few hours reduced to fast moving flashes in my head.

I had been… bleeding. Bad. Inside Disney’s freezer, where Zach had stamped on my fucking head after finding what I was pretty sure were whatever what was left of Roman and Maya. Flynn and Rapunzel. I remembered consciousness came slowly like coming up for air. I didn’t want to go back. I would have rather stayed in an empty and yet peaceful oblivion waiting to be swallowed up. 

But once it hit me, tearing me from a dream where nothing was really happening, but I was at peace—I  was happy, no longer in a nightmarish reality I had been stupid enough to go back to—I felt the first prickles of pain in the back of my head along with memories trickling back into fruition. 

It was nice to be oblivious for a while. 

Unknowing the horrific secret Disney was keeping under a bubbling façade.  But it didn’t take me long to slip back into reality, which was at first confusing—an endless stream of noise in my head and smooth metal tickling my fingertips. I remembered an auditorium and a stage, a figure illuminated in a heavenly glow. A stage show? That’s what it felt like. 

Like the ones mom took me to.

No. No, it wasn’t a stage show. The audience didn’t seem real, a swarm of black shadows and hiding identities. They stood and clapped for the figure, a cacophony of noise drowning my ears. 

But I didn’t feel joy, like them. I didn’t feel excited. Instead, dread coiled in the pit of my gut as the light dimmed and the main event bled into the spotlight. 

Light blue hospital scrubs and dark hair falling in animated eyes which failed to penetrate anything. In fact, his expression was far too perfect to be human. His smile was wide, and I recognised it from my own childhood; it was the smile which lured children to the edge of their window’s ready to fly away to Neverland and never grow old.  Peter Pan. No. More pain spiked. No, his name wasn’t Peter Pan.

It was Jasper.  Who was in the process of being turned into a live-action Peter Pan.  

Just like his brother.

And just like that, the last 12 hours had slammed into me, enveloping me in that despair-inducing dread I had been trying to hide from. I remembered corridors blurred white, and arms wrapped around me trying to keep me from falling. But I was stumbling, staggering, hurricane thoughts driving me to a destination I didn’t know of. 

I remembered a room full of electrical blue light—an icy chill enveloping me. Names carved into metallic plates. I saw them.

I knew them. Maya and Roman. Two people I thought were dead, who had joined The Scarlett Room’s lost girl’s and boy’s a long time ago—a whole legion of souls stuck in eternal imprisonment.  

But there they were. They were right in front of me, and I didn’t care what state they were in. If all that was left of them were frozen remains, or belongings which had been snatched from them. I didn’t care. Because in my mind, I had found them. I had saved them. Before I could think about what I was doing, I was grasping hold of the metal handle and pulling. Something slammed into the back of my head, an explosion of pain sending me to my knees.

The shadow looming over me, who I thought was a guard or the suited man turned out to be my best friend; and his eyes… his eyes were wrong. There was something inside him. I could sense it moving underneath the flesh of his fingers wrapped around the steel rod he’d hit me over the head with. His skin wasn’t supposed to move like that—almost like water with the way it flowed in sync with my sharp breaths gasping for air.  I wanted answers. I wanted to know why he had hurt me, why he had stopped me from opening the freezer full of Disney’s victims. 

But I couldn’t move.

I couldn’t breathe without pain thrumming in the back of my head and spiking down my spine like lightning bolts. I couldn’t think straight. Zach’s words didn’t make sense in my brain. He was talking, but his words were like alphabet soup in my brain; entangled and wrong, like broken puzzle pieces. I drifted in and out of darkness, and though feathered vision I was half-aware of him dragging me over to the far wall and draping his jacket over me.

I remember the graze of the ice cold on my skin combined with the wet warmth of something slipping down my temple. Blood. The world swam around me, tipping to the left and then right as I struggled to stay awake. “Welcome back to the world of the living.” Zach’s voice sounded both distant and close, like ocean waves.

He turned to me once every so often, his expression contorted in what might look like worry before twisting back to the names. I watched him in a blur of fast moving motion, a silhouette knelt in front of the freezer, his hands wrapped around the metallic handle. At times it didn’t even look like him. The way he moved, not in twitching, clumsy strides, like I knew. 

Each step was calculated. He was struggling with the bar. “Wow.” Zach chuckled, and his voice felt like an iron prod cracking through my skull and stirring my brain into a soup. “I’ve got to hand it to these guys. They came up with the perfect lock.”

He yanked the handle again, and I tried not to notice his trembling arms, his hands balling into fists at every failed attempt. “Looks like a mechanical device,” He muttered, surveying the freezer. “Which means we’re screwed.”

Straightening up, Zach folded his arms. The metallic plate on his left temple was spreading like a virus, like skin, blood, matter, was becoming metal right in front of my eyes. It didn’t make sense to me, and yet it also did. Because I had seen it before. Flynn and Rapunzel’s arm under the late afternoon sun glistening like flesh shouldn’t. Zach didn’t look inhuman, but there was a flicker in his eyes which told me everything I needed to know. 

Whatever was inside him wasn’t letting go anytime soon, and it wasn’t going to stop until my best friend was gone. But there was one thing I didn’t understand. His eyes, if I looked past the glint of sentience and the glitter of metal spreading around his iris, he was upset. I could see so much emotion in an expression losing humanity. “Kinda fucked up, ain’t it? Dozen’s of kids stuck in that eternal hell, reduced to nothing but footprints in the fucking snow—and the 2011 crew get a pass?” 

He gestured to Roman’s name. “Why? What makes these guys any different from every kid they’ve taken? Were they special? Did they have something so many others didn’t?”

“Zach.” I managed to get out.

I tried to sit up, but my body felt limp—numb. When I pressed two fingers to my temple, they came back glistening red.

Fuck. I had to bite my lip to suppress a sob.

I was going to die.

“Mm?” Zach responded with a grunt.

“What did….” It was so hard to try to talk, to string words together when my head was pounding. “What did you do?”

He didn’t look at me. “Do you think it’s fair, Emma?”

“What?”

When he finally turned around, there was something circling his Iris, moving. Writhing. “Do you think it’s fair that they’re playing favourites?” Zach slammed his hands into the freezer, and I glimpsed tears in his eyes. Humanity clashing with whatever had taken over him. He did it again and again, pounding his fists into the icy metal until his knuckles were dripping glistening red, but wasn’t fazed. 

“Do you think it’s fair that these bastards get the Walt Disney treatment? I mean, whatever they’ve kept of them, body or— or soul, Spark, whatever they are—- they’re important enough to keep. While the rest?" His laugh was shrill, while my gaze followed the movement under his flesh. I wanted to believe it was a side-effect of concussion but there was no way I could ignore the wriggling under his skin. I could sense them, tiny bugs trying to perforate his flesh.

Creepy crawlies, I thought dizzily.

"The rest," he continued in a sharp breath. "They're just... fed to that monster and spat out on the cutting room floor.”

Finally, the boy twisted to me, and I spied that sliver of silver inching towards the back of his ear.

“And who deserves that?” He demanded in panting breath dancing in the air, “tell me. Who deserves that kind of fate?"

No-one, I thought.

But—why did he care so much?

I opened my mouth to attempt to formulate some kind of answer, when alarms started blaring, cutting into my ears, bleeding into my brain. When guards swarmed the room, Zach didn’t move. His expression was set in stone. When The Suited Man followed suit, he held up his hands mockingly before a guard grabbed him, pinning his arms behind his back. “You caught us.” Zach rolled his eyes. “Congratulations.” He gestured to me, “As you can see, my friend kind of needs medical attention.”

Words escaped me as I was dragged to my feet and given the same treatment. The world was swimming around me, and when I put all my energy into focusing on what was going on, I glimpsed The Suited Man had moved from the doorway to halfway across the room, standing in front of me. There was an amused prick of a smile on his face—and I half wondered if he had been the one to do this to so many others. Princess Rapunzel and Flynn too. 

“What is your favourite Disney movie?”

“What?” I heard myself hiss out when the guard holding me tightened his grip.

“Your favourite Disney movie.” He said again. “What is it?”

“The Incredibles.” Zach gritted out. “Great movie. Also… shockingly not a Disney—argh! Hey, that hurts!”

The guard responded by kicking the boy in the back, sending him to his knees.

“Well?” The Suited Man ignored Zach, his attention on me. “Well?”

I didn’t answer his question. Or maybe I did, but everything was blurring together. 

The words which came out of my mouth didn’t seem real. I remember the man coming close, so close, his breath was in my face. His eyes pierced me. Cold and cruel, and merciless. “You watched my presentation, did you not? We watched you walk into our auditorium, though we were curious what exactly you were going to do. This doesn’t happen often, you know. Children finding their way into business which is not theirs—and when we attempt to get rid of them, they come back. A little like cockroaches.” 

The man’s lips curved into a grin, and I glimpsed a spark of realisation in his eyes. “Ah.” He was answering his own question. His shadow moved closer, and in my head, it was drowning me. The room was closing in on me. “You’re here for the Icarus boy. Trust me, I admire your bravery, I really do.” I flinched when he grabbed my chin. 

“But really, child. What were you thinking?”

When I didn’t reply, he began to pace up and down. “Jasper, am I right? He’s been on our radar since we bought his brother.”

“Bought.” Zach spat into the ground. "Just casually buying people. Totally normal."

“Correct.” The Suited Man nodded.

"The Icarus brothers are different from our usual pick and choosing. Their father owed us a debt and given the circumstances and knowing his wife was expecting, we demanded both of his children upon turning the age of eighteen.”

So, like a modern version of Sleeping Beauty.

Their father promised this cooperation his children in exchange for saving his own skin.

“Oh, yeah?” Zach let out a harsh laugh. “And tell me. How is that project going? Murdering a kid? Is it fun?”

“Zach.” I spoke his name when the guard next to him knelt to my friend’s level and stuck a gun in the back of his head. No, not a gun. Too small. A taser?

Zach didn’t even blink, his expression dark, eyes slitted.  

“Huh.” Tipping his head to the side, the suited man seemed to be enjoying Zach’s attitude. He placed himself in front of Zach, eye to eye. “Something is different about you.” He said, “You’re not the average model we purchase for hollowing, or an unfortunate kid who wandered down the rabbit hole. You’re no Jasper Icarus who was meddling in his brother’s fate, or his female friend.” He gestured to me.

“No, you’re something else.” He leaned in close, drinking all of Zach in—before stepping back with a sigh. I expected him to notice the sliver of silver, which was still spreading, converting flesh and tissue, but the man looked right past it.

“Put him under observation.” He ordered, his smile returning. “As for your question, we are maybe 60% complete with creating the boy who never grew up, and we have been looking for a Wendy.” 

I didn’t make eye contact with him. 

If I did, I’d throw up. I could feel his gaze burning into me; a greedy, almost ravenous twist in his eyes. “Normally, we stake out who we think would fit the first concept art, but I think what we’re looking for is right here in this very room.”

Something in Zach’s eyes turned feral, and he struggled violently. “Are you fucking kidding me?”

“Why not?” The man chuckled. “Wendy Darling, and Captain Hook. I think you’re perfect for the roles.”

“But…that’s not right.” Zach said, his resolve crumbling.  “Isn’t Roman technically the brother who didn’t grow up? Why isn’t he Peter?”

“You’re quite the comedian.” The suited man raised a brow. “I’m sorry, what is your name?”

 “Like I’d tell you my name, Asswipe.”

The man nodded like he was listening, like he was entertaining Zach—for his own amusement. He straightened up with a sigh. “Well, this has been a delight. Escort the comedian and his female friend to the processing parlour, please. I want them hollowed out by noon. They want prototypes tomorrow, so we’ll have to be quick with creation.” He headed to the door, his voice wavering in and out of my ears. It was just noise. Like the endless screech of tortured souls in The Scarlet Room. When I was pulled out into the corridor, and Zach dragged behind me, his voice became a little clearer. 

At first it was more of a mumble, a distant murmur getting closer—before slicing into my brain, enough to snap me out of it. It wasn’t just his voice. His words were piercing. Like knives stabbing me in the back. This man was talking about us like we were—nothing. Like we were products he was selling.

“I’ve already got concept art drawn. Shadings. Some in colour and others in black and white. I’ve been thinking we get rid of Wendy’s ribbon and change it to a headband. Pink, perhaps? Yes. Pink. I want her to be youthful and find a way to reach older children. 
Maybe give her a phone, or wired earphones. As for Hook, think of it more as if you’re creating his son.  Remember, this is a strict reboot. A retelling. We are not disgracing a tale, we are remaking it in the modern world. We need movie-deals, people. I’ve already got Netflix and Plus on my back wanting a gritty teen reimagining.”

The man was fucking insane, I thought. His rambling collapsed in my ears as I was pulled down familiar corridors of blurred white. The psycho was an artist, one of Disney’s minions. He had probably created hundreds if not thousands of favourites—maybe even the concept art for Tangled. And yet there he was treating me like I wasn’t human.

I was his canvas he was eager to wipe clean. The world blurred together as I moved from one place to another.

First, I was taken into a room with pale blue walls; a woman with a permanent grin and wide eyes poked at my head, applying some kind of gel which stung. 

When she held a mirror in front of my face and I peered into it, there was no trace of a head wound—no blood, nothing. The woman told me she was going to clean me up, and I tipped my head back and counted ceiling tiles until my eyes grew heavy. I don’t know how long I passed out. It was enough time for them to transfer me to another room—which I’d found myself in.

Tied to Zach.

Now that I was more awake, I took in the room; what looked like an operating theatre. I spied a bed, medical instruments lain out on silver. The bed had restraints, and I fought to swallow my lunch which quickly crawled back up my throat. Above the two of us was what looked like a scanner. Every so often it slowly descended, bathing us in electrical blue light which was harsh on my eyes.

Zach’s question was still stirring in my mind. 

“Are you regretting your rescue mission now?” I didn’t know much time had passed since he asked it. Time seemed obsolete in that room. There were no windows, no clock. Nothing.

“No.” I finally croaked, in answer to Zach’s question.

 I pulled at our bound hands. Being that close to him, and knowing he’d gotten us into this mess made my blood boil. Zach responded with a laugh.

“No? You’ve lost one brother to Walt’s eternal freezer, and the other is about to become fantasyland’s newest attraction.”

I felt his hands brush mine teasingly. “I’m not a rocket scientist, Emma, but I’d call that a loss.”

“You’re not Zach.” I gritted out.

Just talking to him was driving me crazy. This sentient being inside my friend made up of freakish bugs.

“Oh, really?” He blew a raspberry. “Pray tell.”

I was quick to respond, pulling at my bindings. But they weren’t coming free.

“He wouldn’t... he wouldn’t do that to me.” I whispered, swallowing hard. “I mean… I mean you. You wouldn’t do that.”

As clarity bled more into focus, the effects of Zach’s hit starting to slowly fade away, I started to notice the room we were in wasn’t as pristine as I thought. 

When I looked down, my feet were bare. I’d been stripped of my clothes and forced into the same light blue hospital scrubs Jasper had been wearing. I frowned at my bare toes, but then my gaze caught something on tiles my fuzzy brain thought were white. I mean, everything initially looked white. 

But looking closer, I was seeing… red. I was seeing glistening red, dried red, ancient red. Everything was red. I lifted my head, and it was everywhere, dripping from the walls and tainting the table we were on. Panic spiked inside me, crawling up my spine. I blinked because it couldn’t be real. I understand, at least part of me understood The Scarlet Room. 

It was just what Zach said, the cutting room floor. But not in a place like this.

It wasn’t supposed to be this… filthy. But it was. Every wall was discoloured with blood, or bodily fluids I didn’t want to think about. I didn’t want to think about Roman and Maya, and Jasper being exactly where I was sitting. I’m not sure what was wrong with my brain. My body. 

Why I was frozen, why I couldn’t fucking move. I couldn’t cry out, a cutting screech stuck in my throat. I felt for Zach’s hands and grasped onto them with everything I had, willing myself not to crack.

“Zach.” His name had barely slipped from my lips before the scanner came down once again.

“Please look directly into the light.” It said, a robotic tinge to its speaker.

Three colours flashed. Red, Green, and Blue.

I did what the robot said. It’s not like I couldn’t, the light was so bright, almost hypnotising. One I was looking at it, I couldn’t look away. I think that is what it wanted. It wanted a full scan of our faces. 

Zach’s voice was a welcome distraction as the light slowly took over, bleeding into me. “What wouldn’t I do?” He demanded.

It took a disorienting second for me to realise he was responding to what I’d said before the scanner came down. Part of me wanted to laugh at him choosing the worst moment to bring up our scuffed friendship, but the rest of me was relieved he was still human enough to be an asshole—he was still human enough to want to talk. I blinked when the scanner flashed. It was taking photos, zipping around our heads.

Something pricked my arm.

I barely noticed—and I kept talking. I told Zach how much of an asshole he was for getting us caught. I asked him why he cared so much. He didn’t know them as much as I did. He’d never known Roman and Maya, so why did he act like that?

Then, however, I realised my words weren’t hitting the sound barrier.

I dazedly watched the scanner’s movement. Something was happening to me, like every part of me was… slowing down.

My mouth, my brain, everything.

Again, time seemed to consume our conversation. Figures swarmed the room, but I don’t remember caring.

I lifted my head, and everything felt so heavy. So wrong. I felt hollow, like I had already been emptied.

Like I already was Wendy.

“Like I wouldn’t do… what?” Zach said, again.

His voice was an anchor, keeping me hanging on.

“Knock me out.” I said, slurring my words. The words has been in my head, and then my throat for so long—lingering. There was someone in front of me, raised on her tiptoes, pressing buttons on the scanner. 

I frowned at her torso, at her bright pink t-shirt, my thoughts muddled. 

“Zach wouldn’t do that.” I said, even when I wasn’t sure if he was still in the room. Something tickled my face. Another light flashed in my eyes, and I remember squirming, trying to get away. But a hand grabbed my chin and forced me to look at them. I did, blinking rapidly. They were nothing but darkness, a shadow in my childhood nightmares.

I blinked rapidly when colours spiralled in my vision. I was half aware of more figures in front of me holding clipboards and sketch pads. Through fraying lashes, I caught a young boy. Maybe my age. 

His eyes were glued to me, his expression contorted with concentration, a pencil hanging out of his mouth as he drew imaginary strokes on his pad, creating something out of me. I wanted to punch him. That is all I could think. I wanted to punch him and stick his pencil down his throat until he was choking on it. “He’s my… he’s my friend.” I finished, swallowing hard. Every word felt like syllables coming apart and mixing together. I don’t know why I continued, especially when we had an audience. 

I lost myself somewhere around the time a woman started drawing on my face with red pen. She circled my eyes, and then my lips. The nib of the pen tickled.

He’s my friend.

The words lingered.

My mouth moved.

But they told me to stop.

To stay still.

And while they toyed with me, turning me into whatever concept was in their heads, I was going through the five stages of grief. Especially when I knew what the outcome would be. I’d seen the starting stages in Flynn and Rapunzel, and the end result in Snow White.

Denial.

I shook my head, squeezed my eyes shut and prayed to wake up.

Anger.

I lashed out at prodding fingers and tried to bite someone’s pinkie off, only to be punched in the throat.

Bargaining.

I pleaded for them to let me go to no avail. I was just acting more and more pathetic.

 Depression.

I felt numb as a index finger lifted my head and forced my lips into the widest grin they could muster with metal instruments.

Acceptance.

I talked to Zach, dragging out our conversation which had been lost in a blur.

I mean, I tried to.

“Friend?” Zach scoffed, when the women painting my face finally moved away, and my skin stung.

“Of course, we’re still friends. I didn’t even hit you that hard.”

I surprised both myself and the man in front of me threading a blue ribbon through my hair with an explosive laugh.

“Didn’t hurt me?” I choked out. “You gave me concussion!”

At least that’s what it felt like coming from my mouth.

It was more like, “Yer gavemd sd cusoson.”

“For a reason.” He said, his words far stronger. Easier to understand. “I didn’t want you opening that freezer. Because…”

He trailed off. “Because…” Zach’s voice wobbled. “Fuck. I can’t… think straight. My brain… my brain is being… mashed.”

Do you know those montages of performers being put through hair and makeup before they go onto stage?  That was me. Except the world felt like it was tipping to the left, and yet the nib of the pen continued across my skin, drawing circles, and exposing flaws I didn’t even know about— scribbling over my lips, large arrows on my eyelids. They were cutting out pieces of me, to fit her. 

Their idea of Wendy. Was this what they went through? Maya, and Roman—Dylan, Polly, and Eddie.

Everyone who Disney had taken.

Did they go through this exact process?

Why didn’t they fight? Why didn’t they scream and bite, go feral on these bastards?

I’d been asking myself that question since meeting Roman and Maya 10 years ago.

And now I knew the answer.

When you’re faced with a fate worse than death, fight or flight no longer works and despair kicks in so deep you cannot breathe. 

Until you can’t think straight, your only thoughts are only who you will be leaving behind. 

Self-preservation is forgotten and you give in. When so many people are telling you who you are going to be, that you’re going to be some random kid’s fantasy, and you’re going to make children smile—all you can do is wish the co-called processing to be painless. The more I thought about them, I couldn’t help wondering if they had all thought the same thing as me. If kids in the early 2000’s, 90’s, 80’s, 79’s – even right at the beginning. If they had all imagined others.

It was almost like a hive-mind was blossoming in my skull, like the voices who attacked my brain in The Scarlet Room.

My voice, my wandering thoughts, joined them.

Did their faces get scribbled and drawn over? Flaws circled, their flesh slowly transformed into a canvas, more than a human body, more than anything living. 

They became a scrap of paper on a sketch pad, a rough drawing, a black and white outline. When they finished, or at least left us alone, I broke down. I don’t think I ever thought I’d regret coming back to try and save Flynn Rider and Rapunzel. 

But right then, fear had taken over. Hysteria was pushing my mind into oblivion. I couldn’t escape this. 

Whatever was being done to me was going to become permanent, and the figures, the men and women with sketch pads and excited faces didn’t see a human being. They just saw Wendy.  

I sucked in breath which didn’t seem to exist, and when I tried again, I couldn’t muster enough air to even pant. I could feel it, a panic attack wrenching my chest and sending my thoughts into overdrive. Still though, when I was told to keep still so I didn’t ruin their drafts, I moved my head and contorted my expression as much as I could—until someone’s backhand stung my cheek in a slap I didn’t even feel.

The man playing with my hair told me to breathe in and out.

But that didn’t work.

And all the while, something was moving in my hands. I could feel it, writhing under my skin.

When our audience had left, I took a breath and willed coherent words despite my tangled tongue. 

“What are they?”

“Huh?”

“The bugs.” I hissed out. “Those bugs inside you. They’re doing something to you. What are they?”

He was silent, only responding with a shrug of his shoulders.

“Like I said, Sweetheart,” he said after a pause. “Nano-bots."

It’s funny having concussion. Words almost taste like colours.

Or maybe that was the blood filling my mouth. I bent over, spitting it out, choking on the metallic tinge in my throat. Though the blood had barely fazed me. I was half expecting it after one of the figures bent in front of me and told me I’d be “having an unpleasant time” in a few minutes. 

This must have been what they meant. I didn’t want to think about what exactly it was that was spewing from my lips in lumpy scarlet. But right then, I wanted to think about anything else than register Zach’s words. So, I didn’t. When I was sure my mouth was empty, I tipped my head back and stared hard at the ceiling as the world once again swam. 

“Nano-bots.” I managed to get out. I said it again, and then again and again until both words didn’t feel real. I could still feel them. They were blossoming to life, writhing in my arms, in the contorts of my face and tickling the back of my tongue.

I wanted to talk about them; about the thing’s inside me which were no doubt doing exactly the same thing to me what they had done to Roman and Maya. And yet only one name was in my mouth, choking me. I couldn’t breathe suddenly. His back pressed into mine felt wrong. 

Everything about him. His hair ticking the back of my neck, sweaty palms clutching mine. At some point, between my breakdown, and the scanner coming down for one last time, the boy responded.

“Oh.” He laughed, his body rattling against mine. It was choked up and not at all joyful, but it still felt genuine.

“You’re kinda slow, aren’t you?” Dylan scoffed. “It’s taken you three, maybe four hours to realise. And this guy is your supposed best friend? Wow. I hate to be that guy—but how exactly do you guys know each other? And why are you friends?”

My breaths grew heavy. I had never been with Zach. Not since my best friend dropped into the rabbit hole. And I should have known. I should have realised, and I hadn’t. I hadn’t realised when it was glaringly obvious. I remembered finding Zach in the pile of bodies. He’d blinked rapidly and stared down at his hands, grazing his palms across his cheek. 

Not because he was scared or traumatised. Because he was inside a new body. It was Dylan who had freaked out when we found the freezer.

And why wouldn’t he? He had found the rest of his group had been kept—while he had been murdered.

“The rest?” His voice sliced into my head from earlier. The desperation and anger and despair in his eyes.

I should have seen it.

“The rest are thrown on the cutting room floor.” His words reverberated in my brain. “And who deserves that?”

“Yep.” Dylan popped the P in reply to my question, wriggling in his restraints.

“Consciousness, also Spark, combined with Disney’s technology, created the bots designed to do the dirty work inside our heads before they throw us into the monster for a full-boy transformation, and you don’t want to know what that entails.”

I nodded slowly. Not like I was understanding, instead registering what he was saying.

“How did you…” I trailed off, though he seemed to know what I was going to say. 

“I was stuck down there for 10 years. Don’t lie to me and tell me you would just willingly fade after suffering. Day after fucking day. It’s all the same. I couldn’t sleep. My senses were bust. All I could do was think, and thinking was fucking painful.” He sighed. “I thought about my dad, and then about what I could have done with my life. I thought about my girl I left behind. And after that, I didn’t want to think anymore. But what could I do? I didn’t have a body to kill.” Dylan let out a shuddery hiss. 

“Trust me, I did want to go to sleep. None of that shit I told you was a lie. But I also wanted to see my dad again. And Robyn. So, when an opportunity came around to live again, breathe, and smell, touch and feel again? Of course, I took it.”

“Zach.” I said.

“Yeah. Well, he was dumb enough to jump down. You did tell him not to.”

“How did you do it?” I demanded.

“Easy. You cut the connection to my body, so my Spark lingered. I know it sounds like a fucking fantasy novel, but it’s real.  Think of it like possession. Instead of being a soul, I’m a physical thing latching to your friend’s brain. Call it backpacking.”

“And what I saw.” I swallowed. “The metal plates on his temples. Those… those bugs. That’s you.”

“Congratulations on finally understanding something, Emma.” He sighed. “Look. They slaughtered me back in 2011 and saved the others. I had my suspicions, but when I saw it, I couldn’t stop myself.” I felt him stiffen. “They still have their bodies, or at least something that is them. I have, what? An echo of myself. Footprints in the snow connected to a parasite device.”

“Uh-huh.” I felt dizzy. “And where is Zach,” I swallowed another mouthful of blood. “Where is Zach now?”

Dylan leaned forward, dragging me with him. His struggling was growing frenzied. “I don’t actually know. I’d like to say he’s chilling at the back of our mind. But, considering what my Spark is doing to his body and brain, I wouldn’t be so sure.”

I slammed my head into his.

“Ow! Hey, that hurt!”

“Give him back."

“I would.” He said. “I mean, I was planning on going to see my dad and my girl—maybe get a McDonald’s. And then I was going to give him back.” Dylan shrugged with a laugh. “But now we’re here? Man, it looks like Zach’s body’s joining mine.”

He whistled.

“Shame.”

I changed the subject.

“This thing inside me.” I said. “Am I going to end up like you—I mean Zach?”

“Nah. Well, I mean I guess it’s a matter of whether you’re strong enough. You might get your brain fully rewired, a drastic change in personality— or nothing. Before I was put through the slicer, I started thinking I really was a prince. Trippy shit.”

“Right.” I said. “And Jasper?”

“Yeah. I don’t know about him. They’ve had him for a while. Enough time to start the process, and that’s past the initial injections. That’s a full rebrand of the brain. A total cleanse of humanity. That kid looked preeeety gone when I saw him.”

"What's the difference?"

"Between?"

I squeezed my eyes shut. "Between the bodies in the rabbit hole, and the ones walking around entertaining kids."

"No idea. I just figured the thing's walking around with our faces were just synthetics controlled by our Spark."

"So, Charming--"

He cut me off. "Probably collapsed somewhere, yes. Now I'm fully in control, that thing is a shell."

“Dylan.”

“No.”

“I didn’t even say anything.”

“You want me to help you get out of here and save the kid.” He said. “And why would I do that?” His tone was sour. “So, Roman’s brother gets to live a happy life, and I die? That’s it. I just fucking die. No dad. No seeing my girl. No cheese fries.”

“You’re already dead.” I said without thinking. “You’re a parasite.”

“Thanks. And I was thought we were bonding.”

I don’t know what I replied with. I think I screamed at him.

Before I knew what was happening, the doors were flying open for the 5th or maybe 10th time that day.

This time the two of us were dragged to another room next door. 

This one was somehow familiar—a twin to The Scarlet Room. 

A huge metal machine stood in front of me, and when I saw the splashes of old and new red, I was staring at the mouth which had eaten Snow White. I saw the conveyer belt I’d seen all those years ago. 

I felt myself stumble back, but I just slammed into Dylan, who was already been manhandled. In front, I glimpsed a figure who was being led onto the conveyor belt. I looked at the ground, at my bare toes, at the splashes of colour on the tiles. I wouldn’t look at Roman’s brother.

“Hello.”

The suited man’s voice crackled through speakers. “Usually, we let the devices already fitted to apply some kind of numbness to reduce a truly mortifying experience, but since you have caused me nothing but trouble, just look at the light in front.”

Again, those flashes.

Red, Blue, and Green.

The conveyer belt was started up, and Jasper stepped onto it.

I could already hear the blades whirring.

“See that?” Dylan’s breath tickled the back of my neck.

I didn’t look up. “See what?”

“Right in front of us.” He said shakily. “The Queen.”

Lifting my head, I followed his gaze. The light was so bright, but I refused to look, my gaze flicking to the large machine hissing at the front of the room. Unbelievably, it looked alive, writhing and buzzing, like the bugs wriggling under Dylan’s skin.

Dylan started to speak. “No.” He whispered. “No, I can’t... I can’t fucking do this again. I can’t do this. I can’t fucking... do this.” But his words were drowned out suddenly, but the sound of the conveyor belt, and Jasper disappearing behind the jaws of the monster. I remember screaming. I remember falling to my knees and being dragged back to my feet. 

But then the arms holding me fell loose, and a haunting cry filled my ears. It wasn’t Jasper’s or Dylan’s. It was the guard.

I didn’t have to turn around to see a torso ripped of its head hit the ground, and a shower of red to spray me in the face. Dylan was twitching, his movements sharp as he gripped heads like doll necks and snapped them. Like they were plastic. 

Once I was sure he was keeping the guards busy, I found myself stumbling, like I was walking on air. The machine loomed in front of me, a steel beast. When alarms started up, red lights blaring, it stopped hissing and the conveyor belt came to a standstill.

The mouth was half open, and when I forced myself through the hole, I glimpsed a blood stained blade hanging over Jasper’s head which had stopped inches from severing his head from his body. The promise I made to Roman was fresh in my head as I surveyed him. He was okay.

He was still… he was still whole. I wasn’t sure about mentally, especially when I caught his wide, dreamy smile as he gazed up at the saw looming over him. 

I didn’t think, dragging him from the machine. Dylan had already left, and when I made it onto the corridor, he was already at the exit. It didn’t look like him—or at least him in Zach’s body. 

He was painted in deep red, and his eyes had a glint to them that I couldn’t call human. But he was holding open the door and screaming at me to run, and I was doing that. I was running, pulling Jasper, who was dead weight in my hand.

When Dylan ran through the third swinging door, he tripped over a body on the ground.

Charming. Just like he said.

With him, though, to my shock—was Flynn.

He didn’t look any different, still with that smile, those animated eyes.

When his lifeless eyes found Jasper, however, they darkened slightly, his lips pursing into a line.

Jasper, or Peter, stared right through him.

“Come on.” Dylan hissed, pulling on my arm when I couldn’t tear my gaze from Flynn. From Roman. “You said it yourself. We get the kid out of here, and then we think about them.” He glanced at Jasper. "Speaking of, there’s nothing in there, Emma.”

"He's in there." I said.

But even I wasn’t sure.

Three days later, I realised Jasper was a fucked up hybrid between human, and whatever they had put inside him. Just like his brother. But, thank God, he didn't get that final makeover. Every so often, he'd pipe up with, "Welcome to Neverland, folks! Where kids never grow up!" But then his body would twitch, his eyes flashing, like he’s at war with his own mind.

He sits in front of Dylan’s dad’s old TV and watches static, every so often laughing to himself.

I keep waiting for him to talk to me-- as Jasper.

But he doesn’t.

Dylan’s taken us to his father’s house for now.

I can’t say I trust him when he freaked out and glitched, killing all those guards. But he also saved us.

I can’t help feeling like I’m sitting next to a time-bomb.

Two in fact.

Dylan, and Jasper.

I have no doubt Disney will come and hunt them down.

After all, I took their Peter Pan.

It’s made me realise. Dylan is dangerous, yes. But if I want to get Roman’s brother and Maya back (I know they’re in there.)

Whatever is inside that freezer is what is left of them.

I’ll need Dylan to help me.

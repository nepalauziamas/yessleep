You all need to stop posting. Right now.

It probably won't take long for this to get deleted, but maybe enough people will see it to make a difference. It's the only thing I can think to do. I've discovered something terrible about /r/nosleep and everyone needs to know. Everyone. So you understand any of this, I need to tell you what I've been through the last few days, so you really get it. It needs to sink in. If no one believes me because they don't understand, everything's going to fall apart real fast.

Okay, first some general principles. Every emotion generates a specific electrical signature in the brain. It's so specific that a specialist can reliably determine your emotional state from evaluating live measurements. Electricity creates fields. In the case of our brain activity, the field effect generated by our emotions is so weak it's never been observed, but by the numbers, it's there. Okay, that's one knowledge nugget you need to swallow, here's the next. 

Our Universe - our reality - is ours alone. The reality we all share together is a comfortable agreement, though not objectively the same, and it's reasonable to assume most life in our reality is happy with that arrangement. In fact, evolution has probably  built most life to be that way. Our Universe, our reality isn't the only one though. There are an infinite number that sort of grow outward from our own with decreasing levels of relative probability. What that means is that likely alternate realities are pretty close by, and unlikely ones are way "further" away. If probability were distance. I hope that makes sense. But the real weird part is all that is just a tendency. Some real weird probabilities are actually right next to us, because there are infinite probabilities. And the likelihood gradient I mentioned is only the tendency. It's hard to wrap your head around, I know. It gets easier with practice though.

I'm telling you all this, because there's a really bad reality nudged up right next to ours right now, and some of the things in it are leaking through. One of those things is our mods. It runs all the accounts. It, like us, has emotions and they generate a field - a positronic field, not electrical. Somehow their matter is inverted to ours, which is why I'm trying to get the message out. They're addicts. When we're afraid - when we read our posts and get that chill up our spines - to them it's pure Ecstasy. And their joy? It feeds back to us as terror. There's no sense of shared place or time between our realities, so all fear, everywhere feeds their joy - and their elation pours into our world as a general growing anxiety. People do terrible, horrible things when they're afraid. They make bad choices for the wrong reasons. They destroy things and feel justified. You've seen it. You know what I'm describing. It's been getting worse and worse over recent years too. That's because they're addicted to our fear. They know it now, and they've somehow managed to send agents to our reality to encourage our fear. 

That's how /r/nosleep came to be. The "mods" are all under the pull of a single entity, and it encourages us at every opportunity to embrace and deploy as much discomfort as we can. Please. Please believe me, and do the right thing. It's time to share your personal stories of hope, and sour the milk for them. No more terrifying recollections, it only makes them stronger. Alright, let me tell you what happened to me.

The other day, I posted about something on here, and it got a few dozen upvotes. Not the best visibility, but way more eyes than my worst. I was in a good mood. I thought by sharing terrible events that happened to me, I was making people safer. Apparently though, some readers got uncomfortable about one of the situations I described. They contacted me, and told me they would report me to the mods. I didn't understand why, and I got scared. I love posting here, it's been helping me get through some tough times. A kind of therapy for the things I've seen in my life. Soon after, I got a PM from a mod, she conveyed her gratitude to me for sharing my experiences, but that one Redditor had been incredibly upset. I kept reading her PM, expecting an explanation for an incoming ban, when the next paragraph I read set off all kinds of red flags.

"We don't mind though. Nosleep runs on fear, and if you're good at causing it, then by all means keep at it. We know what the rules say, but it's more important that people see them and less so that they follow them. So please, keep writing - and if you need some inspiration, check out this video: [Link Redacted]. Byeeeeee."

Most mods on most forums seemed irritatingly strict about following the sidebar rules, so I was pretty confused by her statement. Then, without thinking, I clicked the link. I've not included it here because you really don't need to see it. You need to know about it though. The link was to some numbered IP, which is probably something I should have checked before clicking - oops. It was a big GIF that took almost a minute to load. When it did appear, it was high definition one, like something from /r/highqualitygifs. I thought it was bugged though, because when it loaded, it was just noise. Like old school TV noise. At first I just waited for a few seconds, to see if it got past the corrupted part to something visible, but it didn't. Instead the noise started to make sense, visually. Like one of those stereograms from the 90's. An inverted image began to form, and what I saw was nearly indescribable. Everything in the GIF I watched was ... backwards. I'm not saying that the video was flipped, or upside down - I mean the stuff in the actual imagery was backwards - inverted, inside out, the opposite of what it was supposed to be. I don't remember all of it. I barely remember any of it. Grass grew downwards and had a strange, unknowable color. Birds didn't fly. They were glistening sacks of meat and bone with bodies filled with feathers, and they dug warrens in the air. It makes no sense, I know. The sun in their sky was a black void that radiated darkness. Even my description falls short of the mark. Everything was they absolutely wrong, and it was this wrongness that broke me. I had a horrible panic attack that lasted most of the day, and it got so bad I had to take time off work. It's only now, after a week of trying to calm down, that I'm able to even write about it. 

I wanted to forget it, but today I got another PM from a mod that said, "Delicious. Click this next: [Link Redacted]."

I closed the browser immediately.

I don't know much about computers, so I asked my brother about the IP and if it could tell me anything about who posted the GIF (No, I didn't send him the link). He said it sure was, but that the likelihood of a file being hosted on a computer in someone's house was remote, and that it was way more likely to be on a box at a hosting facility somewhere. He looked up the IP anyway, and immediately got interested. It was coming from an old particle accelerator facility buried a few hundred miles east of the Cheyenne mountains. The company that owned it closed it down almost a decade ago due to bankruptcy. My brother is kind of a science buff and just knows shit like this. He pulled some records from some lookup site, and found out that an LLC had bought the land just afterwards. Then had done nothing with it. No construction. No sales. On the business registration document, there was a phone number. He gave it to me and asked me to let him know what I found. 

I called the number, but got no answer.

Almost instantly another PM appeared in my inbox from a different mod, "Never call this number again."

At this point, I'm aware something really gnarly is happening. I call my brother back, and we start talking about things. I finally show him the video, and he only watches a few moments of it before switching it off. He says he's seen something like it before. Then he links me to some fringe science websites, and I give him a hard time because usually, usually that stuff is just for wackos. But this time one of the articles describes everything I wrote above. There's a link to a video the author generated using some kind of algorithm or something. Some math equation for complete inversion. He took a video of a treasured family vacation, and ran it through the filter. Apparently the output was so unsettling, it ruined his life. He couldn't be with his family anymore, or do his work, or focus on anything but memories of the filtered video. A few years later, the poor guy apparently killed himself because he couldn't deal with what he saw (which makes me real nervous when my brother tells me).

Then the whole science blog site goes down, and another PM appears in my inbox. This time from a different mod, "What did we tell you?"

Ever since then, my phone has been getting texts non-stop with video links, my email is blowing up, and I can't even glance at my inbox anymore. I feel like it's only a matter of time until I accidentally see one of these videos again, and it sends me over the edge. Before that happens, I wanted to let you all know about this threat. That it's here, it's real, and it could be in your inbox right now.

Sorry for any typos, I'm in a hurry. I'm headed out to a family cabin to try and isolate myself until this blows over. Be careful, and if you do decide to post, write about joy and happiness instead. Give them something to cry about. Good luck, stay safe.

**Edit:** Hey everyone. Sorry. I just wanted to apologize for this post. I'll leave it up as a reminder to us all not to let anxiety rule our lives and dictate our actions. I was totally off my shit. Sorry about that. I finally got tired of my phone ringing, so I dried it off and answered it. Boy, am I glad I did. I've been happily chatting with the kind and empathetic mods over at NoSleep for the last twenty minutes. They sent me a PM and invited me to their Discord channel, and it's been a real blast. We've been sharing funny links, keeping it light, and they've showed me some things. 

Some wonderful things.

I'm not going to share it all here. I'll wait a few days and talk about it all in a new post. The mods have really helped change my perspective on a bunch of things, and I feel refreshed and energized in a way I've never felt before. The fear that used to rule me almost feels like a secret superpower now. It's so exciting!

I can't wait to show you.

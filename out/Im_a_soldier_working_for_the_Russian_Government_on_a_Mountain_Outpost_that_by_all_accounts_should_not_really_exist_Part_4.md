*What the hell was I thinking?* I ask myself as I splash cold water into my face. *Am I really so irresponsible?*

Charlie… that man can drink like a fish. How could I have allowed myself to get so swept up?

I run my hands through my hair, rub my thumbs over my eyes.

*No, no use placing blame. This is just as much my fault as it is his.*

An ice-shower follows. The water like needles across my body. A crate of some weird, Russian soft drink is discovered in the back as I dry myself off. A curious green Gatorade-like juice labelled: ‘Напиток тархун’.

I pop the cap and chug one down, as do the others. Tastes okay, I guess, though I don’t know how long it’s been here. The electrolytes, if indeed it has any, should do me good. I can hear Elena arguing with Kristian in another room, though I cannot make out the words.

“Ugh…” I take a look at myself in the mirror. At my bloodshot eyes. The guilt in my expression.

I give myself a light slap across the face and head toward my station, with a few parting words to Charlie. He raises his eyebrows at me and grimaces, but says nothing.

Time’s up. Our ‘revitalization hour’ has passed. The night cometh.

I clamber up my ladder and wince as my head breaches the gap in the ceiling, the wind blowing cold and fierce into my face.

Elena shouts up at me from below.

I turn down to her, pausing on the final rung. “What?”

“YURI!” she shouts again, angrily. “Where is Yuri?”

*Crap.*

“I didn’t- I don’t know, I haven’t seen since earlier. He’s not at his station?”

“NO!” Elena replies, “he ISN’T! And the sun will be down in a minute or so!”

She draws her radio from her belt and up to her mouth. “April. April come in please. Have you seen Yuri?”

“Oh, Elena”, I call down. “April’s radio is still broken, she won’t be able to hear you”.

Elena swears loudly in Russian, slamming the radio back into its clip on her belt. “What is WRONG with you people?” she exclaims, swivelling on the spot and marching off through the complex.

Shivering, I return to the ladder and ascend up and onto the roof, heading over to my position by the gun and dropping down to a crouch, looking through the sights at the mountainside all around.

Another clear night tonight.

I blink rapidly, trying to force away the dizziness. The bitter cold of the air helps, somewhat. I am aware of the gravity of my fuckup, but still, I do actually feel a little braver, tonight.

*Brave? No, you’re just stupid. Idiot, idiot. You’re still drunk.*

&#x200B;

The sun sinks behind the mountains…

…I wipe a sheen of alcohol sweats from my forehead, glancing away and up to the sky. Clouds swirl softly overhead, and little flakes of snow begin to fall, one by one…

&#x200B;

I wonder how long it’ll take for the demons to show up this time. Last night gave us three hours of steadily building tension. Could it be a similar story tonight? More, maybe?

My question is swiftly, and brutally answered. Even before I have had time to allocate significant brainpower to such a line of thought, they appear. To my utter dismay, the demons arrive, at the very instant the night begins.

The tip of the sun sinks beneath the horizon, and the song begins to shiver its way through the night from peak to peak. Discordant, tonight. Jarring, sharp notes where one does not expect them. Like nails on a chalkboard.

I grit my teeth.

Dark, void-like air crashes in the form of waves into the cliff far below, right where the rocky slopes are lost to darkness… and up they clamber.

Two to begin with. Shadowy near-formless shapes… those long, shimmering arms reaching out, grabbing hold of the rock and hauling themselves up towards me. The arms vanish back into air as more are thrown out, an endless cycle of grabbing hands and clawing, feverish limbs.

I suck some mountain-cold air in through my teeth and angle down the weapon, the great contraption clanking and creaking as I fire the first, chaotic stream of screaming light.

Down tears the beam with an electric shudder, an arrow of gold in the gloom as it burns right past the demons directly below. I curse and try again, this blast too going wide.

“Come on, come ON!”

Third time lucky. I feel the juddering in my forearms as the light is sent searing down, and the demons are both caught together. They burst into wisps of smoke and shards of clattering bone, and I bring the weapon around, firing again as the next of the abominations appears over to my left.

*This is not good. This is not good at all. Where the hell is Yuri? IS Elena even at her station yet? She was trying so hard to make sure that the rest of us were all ready… Why did the demons have to arrive so early tonight? Shit.*

One of the creatures gets frightening close. Adrenaline surges as the shadow ripples up the mountainside towards me. Reaching up and out with a desperate hand- and at this range I swear I can see the rough outline of… of *something*, in its shadow… a head and a pair of shoulders, perhaps..? A jaw that stretches from one side to the other, opening wide as the darkness spills out.

I cry out in horror and slam down the weapon, releasing a beam directly beneath… temporarily blinded as the blast thunders out and tears down the rocky wall below, destroying the demon with a screech and a clatter of bones.

One of these bones, a piece of rib, by the looks of it, flies up and over my head. I duck to the side as it flies behind me and strikes the wall, tumbling down to the ground below.

*Too close. Too close. Come on Adam, come on. Don’t let the Enemy into the Outpost.*

*DON’T LET THE ENEMY INTO THE OUTPOST.*

I blink some more as the colorful streaks of retina-burned light flash across my vision.

I groan and my stomach lurches. I’ve found a way to somehow make my experience on this Outpost even worse.

*Your comrades lives are at stake. Wake up, soldier.*

“…*Wake up, Adam*”, whispers the voice of a demon into my ear. I jump in fright and swat at the air instinctively, but there is, as always, nothing there. “*Wake up and see the truth.* ***I*** *require entry to the tomb.* ***I*** *do not want to hurt you, but* ***I*** *will do what* ***I*** *must.* ***I*** *have been waiting for a long, long time”.*

I grit my teeth and swing the weapon around, firing off concentrated bursts at the approaching targets.

“What the hell *are* these things..?” I mutter to myself, Blasting the weapon again and again. The alcohol has provided me with some temporary resistance to the cold, it would seem. The wind, despite the shock of the initial chill, does not seem quite so brutal.

…But the trade-off in terms of accuracy and ‘sense of impending doom’ were really not worth it. Not worth it in the slightest. Many of my shots go wide. The demons clamber ever closer to my position, streaming constantly up the walls… And every time that they reach a certain distance away my terror flares up, the fear of the unknown. I still don’t know exactly WHAT would happen if such a creature were to breach and make their way onto or into the Outpost.

A shout way off to my right draws my attention. I shoot a quick glance over the roof and catch a blur of movement at the wall’s edge. Lightning-like flashes in the darkness all around illuminate the edges of the cliffs, the walls…

…and my comrade. *Yuri.*

&#x200B;

My blood freezes.

&#x200B;

The man is a mess. Stationed on a section of roof across a gap, over to my right, he is shouting belligerently down and into the shadows below. I watch in horror as a pair of hands grab the wall by Yuri’s side… It’s difficult to see from this distance, but there is nothing else they could be. Yuri bellows in Russian and staggers back to his weapon, grabbing it, taking careless aim, and then swinging around the thing around in a chaotic arc: a blast of light tearing towards me, right *past* me in fact as I shield my face from the rush of heat, slipping and  stumbling backwards and striking the section of wall behind me with a thud.

“JESUS!” I shout. “YURI! WHAT THE HELL?”

But he cannot hear me. Either that, or he is simply failing to listen. The light goes wide again and again as the man struggles with the machinery. He wipes his eyes with a sleeve and slurs a long string of words as he sways from side to side.

I reach for my radio and bellow into it. “Elena! Are you there? Yuri is up on a post right beside me, but he’s a mess- something’s going to happen, something bad-”

And as I speak I watch; I watch as a dark shape grabs ahold of Yuri’s arm.

Yuri swears and draws a knife from his belt, hacking and slashing at the smoke.

It seems to do little, however, and more of the substance envelopes him.

A moment more, and he is falling. The shadows drag him over the edge.

&#x200B;

I watch with eyes wide, as everything in the moment begins to play out in slow motion.

Yuri slips from the wall and tumbles down the cliffside into the darkness below. Lights flash at the edges of my vision, and the snowflakes fall thicker all around.

“YURI!” I shout, but the man has vanished.

I draw my radio up to my mouth and try to report this, hands shaking. “He’s- Yuri’s gone over!” I shout, “he’s gone over the edge!” but my radio only crackles with static. I look down over the edge, peering into the darkness. Hastily I return to my weapon, launching a beam in a wide, axe-like arc directly below, obliterating a group of the demons, and illuminating, for a moment, Yuri, trapped on a rocky outcrop below, his back against the cliff, darkness swirling all around him.

“SHIT! YURI!”

But the man does not respond.

Unsure what to do, I spend a further few moments blasting demons away from the rock below… Shooting a few wide to try and keep Yuri’s immediate area free from them…

…And in a moment of brief respite, with the cliffside below entirely clear… I make a decision.

I abandon my post. Aware of the critical importance of the first rule, but still, there is a man in danger. I scramble down the ladder in haste and sprint through the complex corridors, towards the equipment room. The room that Charlie found me in, as it happened.

I burst in and look wildly all around:

*Where is it? Where is it..?*

And yes, in a rack stashed in a corner is just what I found earlier. Standard US Army issue, covered in dust: a set of old climbing gear. I run over and grab it up into my arms, running as quickly as I can back through the halls, over to the room and ladder that will take me up to Yuri’s post, and I climb.

Up I go, back into the wintry world above, and dumping the equipment onto the ground in the snow I jump to Yuri’s weapon, angling it around and feeling the electric crackle across my skin as I send a beam out, diagonally down the side of the cliff. Demons burst and steam with shattering bones, and I swivel on the spot, grabbing the equipment and getting myself into it as quickly as possible, finding an anchor to attach it to, al whilst simultaneously trying to protect both my own, and Yuri’s sections of wall.

I swear to myself, over and over, sweating and shaking in the snow, my hands alternating between the straps on the gear and the mechanisms of the weapon attached to the wall. I try the radio again, for a second time. I try simply shouting, as loud as I possibly can-

*Christ, I should have called to someone when I was in the complex. Why didn’t I think of that?*

But it’s too late now.

“YURI!” I call down, and the man looks back up at me, his face illuminated briefly and faintly in a distant flash. A demon slithers up onto the rock by his feet and he kicks at it in alarm. I jump to the weapon. “DUCK!” I shout, firing a prolonged beam down into the shadows. Yuri shields his face as the demons about his feet are obliterated, and I bring the beam across the chasm below.

I jump for a Bible, of which there are several piled up against the wall, and I flip one open, rifling through the pages for a good passage…

…But it’s pointless. It’s all in Russian. I can’t read a single word of this.

“Oh God!” I shout, then I lean over the edge and throw the Bible down to Yuri. He reaches up to catch it, but misses, and it lands unceremoniously at his feet on the ledge beside him.

“I’m coming for you man”, I mutter, finally finishing affixing the climbing gear to myself and the Outpost, and- with a breath- clambering over the side, and stepping clumsily down into the dark.

The sensation is hugely, hugely uncomfortable. It’s like the air is thicker down here. Wetter, almost. It becomes harder to take in breaths, but down I go. Step by step down the rock. Praying that the demons will stay in the darkness beneath, just for a little longer. Long enough for me to grab Yuri and haul him back up and over the wall.

I reach the man and put out a hand. He stares at me, eyes bloodshot, forearms all scratched up and bleeding… He says something to me in Russian.  Staring with utter disbelief.

“COME ON!” I shout to him. “NO MAN LEFT BEHIND, GODAMNIT!”

Yuri swears in Russian and grabs ahold of my shoulder-straps.

“We’re going up! Come on, help me here, you have to climb!” I tell him, grabbing a hold of his jacket, and making to haul us both back and up the side of the cliff.

Back up we go, blood pounding in my veins… And I can only watch in dismay as, despite my bitter hopes, a demon slithers its way right past us.

I get the closest view of one of these creatures so far. From this angle, it looks vaguely, ever so slightly *human*. One comprised of rippling smoke and mist. Its arms move with such speed that it’s impossible to tell how many it might have. An arm stretches up, grabs hold of the rock to drag the demon up, and in the very same second another arms comes up to replace it, and another, and then another.

“NO!” I shout out into the night, as the demon rushes right past, grabbing hold of the lip of the Outpost wall up above, and clambering over the side, and onto the roof, out of sight.

*NO!*

“Yuri come ON!” I shout to the man, and together we climb back up the rope, faster than I would have thought possible… But we reach the summit and fling ourselves back over the edge and onto the Outpost. I take a deep but shaky breath, throwing myself at the weapon and bringing it around, light releasing into the darkness.

I grab the man by the front of the uniform. “Are you good, Yuri?” I shout, “can you man this thing?”

He nods, bewildered. He shoves me away and returns to his station, reaching for a Bible and flipping through the pages, and I make to unfasten myself from the climbing harness.

I grab my radio again, bringing it up to my mouth. “Attention!” I say into it. “A demon- There is a demon in the Outpost!”

I tear the equipment off and clamber unsteadily down the ladder, darting through the complex, looking this way and that for any sign of the intruder.

I don’t know what I will do if I actually find it, however. Everything is a blur. I just know that this is partly my fault, my responsibility, and so I have to be the one to deal with it.

Shadows lurk and creep in the corners of the complex. Light flashes through the thick glass of the windows as I race between the walls.

“HEY!” I shout down the halls, “HEY, SHOW YOURSELF!”

A voice crackles through my radio. Elena’s. Two words:

“Where?” she says, then: “When?”

I grab the thing and bring it up to my face. “Five minutes ago, or so- my side of the Outpost. With Yuri, by Yuri’s station!”

The radio crackles.

“And where are you now?” she replies.

“Inside the complex, near the kitchens. Trying to find it!”

“No. Return to your station. Do not engage. I will deal with this”.

The ice in her voice makes it difficult to disobey. I falter, but then just do as she says. Running back through the complex, expecting to get jumped at any second, returning to my post and ascending the ladder…

…A part of me is waiting for a demonic hand to reach out below me. To grab me round the ankle and drag me down and away into the shadows…

…But no, nothing happens.

I climb back up and out into the snow, shielding my eyes as a beam lights up the area immediately before me. One of Yuri’s. Bones rattle and clatter down the mountainside, and I return to my weapon, carrying on with my duty, the fear like a fire within me.

Elena’s voice comes through the radio again:

“Barricade entrances to Outpost immediately, all. Draw up ladders if possible. Do not return into complex for any reason. We must wait and hope for the rising sun”.

And so I do. I reach for a nearby crate and heave it across the roof in order to block the little passage back into the Outpost. I draw up the ladder with a clatter and block up the entrance as best I can.

*Is this really our plan?* I can’t help but wonder. *Leave the demon inside to its own devices? What happens at daybreak? Will it simply die?*

That’s what I’m hoping. But it’s too chaotic right now to formulate any kind of serious alternative. I just do my best to keep any further demons from breaching the walls.

*Rule Number One… Do not let the Enemy into the Outpost…*

*…Do not let the Enemy into the Outpost…*

&#x200B;

Fuck. Oh Hell. And I was doing so well, too. What’s going to happen now? What’s going to happen to the Outpost? To us?

I remember Kristian’s words from earlier. About the last time the demons got into the complex:

*‘It was like… like taking away the mosquito net, by the banks of a tropical river’.*

I grimace.

And as the night deepens, the demons become more and more numerous.

Where as in the previous nights, and in the past few hours, it was the occasional assailant… Clambering up the cliffside in ones or twos… they now appear thick and fast, in hordes.

Constant. An endless stream of monsters in the dark.

Sweat pouts from my body. I can feel it freezing across my skin. My hands ache and burn with exertion, the muscles in my shoulders and upper back scream in time to the blasts of the burning, blinding light.

The song from the mountains is almost entirely lost beneath the endless shiver and rattle of ribs and spine and bones as demon smoke billows in all directions. My silver cross is gripped tight in my left hand, my voice repeats a nonsensical tale of ceaseless, disjointed, vaguely appropriate Bible verses until it is hoarse, and still I shout out into the shadows.

&#x200B;

The whispering becomes worse.

And the things they say…

“*Adam. You are no first man”.*

*“Stand aside. You cannot stop the tide”.*

*“You are a good man, Adam. You do not belong here. End this. Just let* ***me*** *pass.* ***I*** *won’t hurt you or your friends,* ***I*** *promise. Let* ***me*** *in, before it is too late.* ***I*** *can save them, if you let me”.*

*“Your brother would understand. JUST STAND* ***ASIDE!”***

&#x200B;

Tricks. All of it, tricks. I have to believe this, because any alternative is too dangerous to even consider.

&#x200B;

So I do my duty. The Outpost and the surrounding mountains are flashed with light and fire and smoke all the long way through til the sparks of the morning.

I do not collapse with instant relief as the first flicker of sunlight appears on the horizon. I do not even notice it. My eyes are shot with retina-burnt streaks of color. Every blink is like a fireworks show. My hands are white and frozen, yet still they tremble violently, gripped tights to the sides of the weapon. I angle it this way and that, then back again, searching for demons, still repeating the verses over and over…

…But after several minutes of no further approaching creatures, I finally risk a quick glance up to the sky.

I see the light. The natural light. Of the *day*, not whatever terrifying light it is that we create here with these accursed weapons. I gasp and stagger backwards, unclenching the fingers of my left fist, slowly, listening to them crack, and I carefully pry the silver cross from my grip. A deep imprint has been left in my flesh, the outline obvious, and I return the little cross to my chest, eyes still wide.

Shivering.

In a dreamlike daze I push aside the crate and the other items I used to barricade the entrance to the rooftop lookout. I send the ladder back down with a metallic rattle, the noise like the bones of the demons against the rocks.

I turn, and step by shaking step I descend, my muscles failing me on the final few rungs and I crash down into a heap at its base, groaning as I try to climb back up.

&#x200B;

*Sleep.*

*I need to sleep.*

&#x200B;

It’s weird… my mind tells me I need to rest, but my body remains on high alert. Heart pumping. Senses primed, despite my weariness. It’s very difficult to describe.

And I know I’m going to get shouted at by Elena, too. Something I’m really not looking forward to.

Elena…

&#x200B;

Fuck.

And the *demon*.

There’s a still a demon between these walls.

&#x200B;

Kristian appears at the end of the corridor, rubbing his forehead.

“Kristian!” I croak out, raising a hand and walking towards him.

The light from the sun has yet to do more than allow the briefest trickle of light through the glass, and the walls are still thick with shadow.

“Kristian, hey, is it safe? Do the demons all disappear when the sun rises? Is there anything we need to do?”

Kristian sighs as I approach, he brings up a second hand to rub his eyes.

“Kristian”, I say, in a voice barely above a hoarse whisper. “You heard the radio, right? The demon… The one that got in… Is it gone? What do we do? Is it safe?”

&#x200B;

The man removes his hands from his eyes. A dark, human-sized silhouette at the corridor’s end. A warm body between these cold, sterile walls. And he turns to me.

...Slowly.

His body remains perfectly still, however, as do his shoulders, and only his head makes the turn… turning slightly, *ever* so slightly further than it *should*.

I stare at him, and he at I.

He steps from the shadows, and I am able to see his eyes in the dim glimmer of light. The color in them has completely vanished. There is only white, with the tiniest pinprick of a pupil in the centre of each.

&#x200B;

I take a slow, horrified step back.

“Kristian…”

The black of the man’s pupils dilate. They expand, and then they expand further still, until the entirety of his eyes are washed over in black.

His body cracks as he moves it around to line up with his head, and step by step, he begins to make his way towards me, shambling through the shadows.

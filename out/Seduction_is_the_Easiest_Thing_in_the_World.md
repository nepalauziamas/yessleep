You’ve selected something light and blooming. A rose that will linger gently on his tastebuds as you stride past him. He is certain to notice, and you’ll feel his eyes following as you take a seat at the bar. You order something knowing you won’t drink it. You didn’t come here for alcohol, did you?

Step two, eye contact. You’ll scope the room as if you’re looking for someone when your eyes meet his. Let them dance, linger there for one heartbeat longer than feels safe. Look away as if you’re shy but let your lips fall into a smile. You’ve got him. Without hesitation he will come join you and your untouched drink, asking if you’d like another.

Three, know the right things to say. Yes, you’re new to this bar. Then why do you look so familiar? Why, you must have a doppelganger lurking around! You’ll both laugh and the loose strap of your dress will fall. Delicately, like a gentleman he will replace your strap, saving you the indecency of a bare shoulder. You both pause when his skin is against yours. There’s something magnetic about you drawing him in but he doesn’t know what. Smile knowingly.

Four, the proposition. What’s he drinking? Whatever it is you have the best kind waiting at the bar in your apartment. Would he like to join you? He’s had four drinks since you’ve arrived. You’ve kept track. This is the telling moment. No means no yes means yes. He’ll say yes, they always do.

He’s following you now, to your gritty apartment in a bad neighborhood. This isn’t what he was expecting, having met you on the Upper East Side. Ignore his comments and lean into him for a kiss. Bite his lower lip, he won’t expect that either. Five is touch and you’ve given just enough of yourself to have all of him. There will be no more words as he steps into your humble studio.

Shut the door after you and lock it. While he’s giving himself a tour, put a record on. Play something too loud. Does he want to dance? Bring him in close, rest your head against his shoulder while he says how he never expected tonight to go this way. Listen to his thick, delicious pulse.  No need to hold back any longer, the stage is set. Dig in.

Clench his hair in your fist, too hard. He doesn’t like that. Pull back his head and expose that beautiful neck, bear and throbbing. Bite. Tear into him as he lets out a yelp. Be vicious, be ruthless, he now knows something is terribly wrong. He’ll punch you and try desperately to escape but you’ve locked the door from the inside and he is trapped. “What the fuck?” he’ll cry. “What are you?”. Close in on him against the wall. Slice into his flesh with your nails like talons. Drink and between fevered gulps say,

“My name is Myra… and I’m a monster.”

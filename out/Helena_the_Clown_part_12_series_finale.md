Hello again. Ruxandra broadcasting.

&#x200B;

For the final time, it seems. At least for now.

I  found myself in an open field. Clear blue sky, unlike the one on Earth.  I begun to hear a piano and went to the source of the sound. It sounded  beautiful unlike any piano on Earth. On a small chair, a woman, about  30 years of age (apparently), dressed in a belle epoque blue dress, was  playing. As I came close, she stopped, rise up and came to me. She was  light blonde haired, her eyes were blue and the skin very fair. Her eyes  had a light in them, a power so big, yet so much peace came from her...  She smiled gently.

&#x200B;

”Hello  Ruxandra. You have heard of me, you may even realize who I am.” she  said to me. ”You are Alexandra.” I replied. She nodded her head. I felt a  little confused, so I have asked: ”Am I dead? Is this Heaven?” She  giggled: ”No, silly. Neither. This is a vision shown to you. You can not  imagine how Heaven is, yet, you are not ready, as you are not ready to  see me how I am in there. This is a form that is given to you so that  you shall be able to receive what I will tell you.” I looked into her  eyes. She continued: ”You have many questions. Not of them I can answer,  but some I will, even before you ask. I do not know if you can escape  from here. One thing you have to do: You need to trust The Lord and  trust that my dear sister, Helena, will do her best to save you, even if  she will do it her way, that it is not always the best way.

&#x200B;

I  am one of the Friends of the Lord, the Saints, now, because I did the  right thing when I could have done it. Helena could have been just like  me, but she has fallen. She became a creature of darkness, a creature of  the night, a monster, a predator who hunts the living and does the  biding of evil. A lot of darkness and evil is in her, as she is now, and  your mortal beings are naturally afraid of her, since she is what she  is. She has done so many horrible, evil things, yet something always  remained inside her, a faint, distant, memory, a faint, distant hope. I  have prayed for her a lot ever since my soul left my body, and helped  her, even in the last days spent in that cage, before she was  transformed.

&#x200B;

You, The Lord, and His angels send thoughts, feelings to  living peoples souls, like demons send evil ones, but people have the  choice to either accept them or reject them. Besides prayers, I have  also been next to her so many times, crying with invisible tears,  sending her thoughts, even caresses, that she received or not, of  course, unconsciously. She was able to do the right thing, at least a  lesser evil, in many circumstances. And that mattered to The Lord. Like  when she decided to let those people know the army was coming for them.  Or when she decided to show some mercy, some pity to her victims. So  many times I was there, beside her.

&#x200B;

Her  mother also helped her so much, both when she alive on this Earth, with  her prayers, because the prayers of the mother count much for The Lord.  Also her tears. Then, her suffering, her martyrdom made her a Saint as  well, and she continued to fight for her from the other side, like me.  You know, Helena has an opened door now. She did not dared to get close  to The Lord, she believed herself a creature of evil for good, but she  kept a small hope. Indeed, the Holy Cross, holy water burned her, as a  creature of evil, but not like demons, like the fear she brings is far  lesser then the ones brought by demons, as yourself have just seen, when  the demons who ordered, without them knowing, to those people to kill  children, attacked you. The Lord has opened a door for Helena, through  you an through father George, who believed in her, even without  realizing. She felt so empty, so hopeless, when father George treated  her first like a demon, but she kept her pain, not turned it into hatred  or retribution. She looked.

&#x200B;

Then, the oil from the Sacrament of  Unction, the cross, the blessings given to her burned her, but also  caressed her, and she received them with open heart. Then accepted to pray. It was enough for  her then, and now she can go to the next step. She may fail and continue  to be a terror of darkness, hurting and killing people, even innocent  ones. That may well still be. Her heart is deeply hurt and has little  reason to dare to accept a great gift. Tonight is the night that can  change her life. And yours. If she accepts the calling, she will still  be what she is now: a monster of the dark. But she will also be  something else. And that happened to her, all that she is now, will be  turned into a great gift, and her mission will be great for The Lord.  Now, you need to trust her. And pray for her. She needs love and  acceptance. You can give them. Underneath the darkness, there is a soul  that has her own, unique beauty.” A light covered her then and I woke up  back in the basement.

&#x200B;

They  were quite nervous, so to say, I do not know how much time passed.  Ghiță took the light from his phone and went outside. He came back fast,  somewhat scared: ”They are dead! Both of them are dead! Their guts are  out” Yep, that is her. A rumble was inside, I even heard the voice of  Damian. Ok, so he was safe. But now what? The doctor grabbed me and put a  gun to my head. ”You are going with me, ma„an, he said. I will make it  alive from here, bur I need a warranty. Anger took over me and shouted:  ”You are a real monster! Human life matters to you nothing! Only your  profits!” He looked at me: ”Indeed, profits. But, there is something you  should have noticed before. In life, we have no real choice. We can do  not oppose the context our or lives. We are forced things that we never  thought possible. But yet, you make them, because you can not avoid  them.”

&#x200B;

”Yeah, right? And the Hippocrates oath?” He brought a superior,  but also pretty dumb smile. I felt a deep, burning hatred for him, but  then I remembered the smile of Alexandra and snapped out of it. Only the  small light of two phones brought light in all that darkness.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile,  as I found out later, Adrian arrived already. The place was in  darkness, as the sun had already set and the lights were out. He so  Helena coming out of the basement of the building, dragging two bodies  of heavy men, he also so two other men dead, with their abdomens cut  open, in the yard. Helena dragged those bodies, who seemed to be still  alive back of the building, into the railway. Adrian followed her in  fear and silence. She seems to use her old gestures of using invisible,  ”ghost” objects, on the railway area, even tied up some invisible ropes  or cables. Then she got back and went in the basement. All this was done  in complete, cold silence. She has noticed Adrian, looked at him, but  said nothing. Still afraid, he decided to after her, with the light from  his phone.

&#x200B;

Downstairs,  I have the dread I already knew. The light of the phones showed the  figure of Helena, at the bottom of the stairs. I started to shake at her  sight, especially because Alexandra suggest she might not do what is  right. I so her whitish, cold eyes for a second, a deep shiver went on  me. If she wanted, she could finish us all. Of just the bad people? I  was held with a firm grip by the doctor, the meds in the system were  still present, that made more weak and more vulnerable both to them, and  to the monster with us. It was clear they felt the same fear, probably  worse then me. I heard Cougar scream, as he was put down, with his spine  broken. He screamed in agony, then his arms and legs were broken as  well. He kept screaming. Then I felt the grip of Helena„s arm on my  assailant, and I could barely kept myself from fainting of fear. In  Helena was a cold, deep hatred and, it felt that, if I stood in her way,  I shall be gone as well. I would not be the first time she hurt and  even killed people who just stood in her way.

&#x200B;

The  doctor started to scream, as his spine, his arms and his legs were  broken. I took the doctors phone and tried to bring light to was  happening. Helena went to the back, to Damian, who was conscious yet and  screamed at her sight. She dis some things there, as she removed the  ropes that held him to the table, and whispered to him in her snaky  voice: ”You are alive now. But be careful, if you do not change your  wicked habits, if your parents will still continue to teach them, tell  them this: I shall come for you all. Got it?” Damian shook his head in  terror. Helena let go of him and said: ”Now go!” He ran away and I came  after him. I found Adrian and we both helped find the way out. He did  not seemed to be seriously hurt. Adrian broke the lock on the gate, so  he was free to run out.

&#x200B;

Suddenly,  they come back. The little demons. Flying around me, in circles. There  was a sharp feeling of something I can not truly describe. A mixture of  intense fear and intoxication. I could find no other way then felling to  my knees and pray to The Lord. Without, I was powerless against them. A  deep hatred and a deep desire to terminate me. Right there and right  now. I prayed: ”Lord, please, have mercy on me, the unworthy! I want to  live. I am selfish and I want to live, I am bad, but I need you. Have  mercy on me, I shall change! Please send Alexandra!”

&#x200B;

After  saying that, a gentle hand touched my should and I instantly calmed  down. I heard Alexandra saying: ”They are trying to scare you. They are  not allowed to do more then this. It is ok. I shall stay with you until  it ends. It is soon now. My sister Helena is on the right path. When she  will be over, tell her both me and her mother are proud of her.” In all  the peace, I have dared to look into Alexandra„s eyes and ask: ”Yet,  what is it Helena? Does she know what she is?” Alexandra replied: ”Yet,  this is not the best moment to ask this, but I shall tell you one thing:  She is a very special form of vampire. Similar, in some ways, with the  ones in western Europe, but, in another way, very different from them.  She can drink blood, enjoy it and benefit from it. But she mostly did  not, she used other ways of sustenance. She does not very well in  daylight, but she can live in it. Now, please pray and let Helena do  what she will do.”

&#x200B;

Back  outside, we so Helena coming out of the basement, dragging the two men.  She also brought them to the back, but not to the railway itself, with  the others. She made some gestures with „ghost objects” and waited. We  stood still for a few minutes, then a rumble came from the north. We so  nothing, but we heard it: It was the ghost train of Lizeanu! When it  reached our proximity, when heard the bones of the two gangsters being  crushed by the train. Helena whispered to the doctor and Cougar: ”Satan  has claimed your souls!” At the same time, she brought together two  ”ghost cables” and electricity came into their bodies. The light bulbs  of the lampposts in the yard ignited into light, but flickered. The  train passed, then two men were burned by the current that came through  the ”ghost” cables. The bulbs started to give shine brightly more and  more, up to the point when the eyes hurt when I looked at them. Then,  one of after the other, the bulbs exploded. The trains passed, Helena  dropped the cables and it all went dark. Alexandra kissed the top of my  head and left.

&#x200B;

After  a few minutes of silence, we looked at Helena, who still stood there,  like a statue, looking at us, and at the burned bodies of the two. She  had an empty expression. Still shaken, I braced myself to go to the her.  I looked into her eyes. I smiled and said. ”Well done. You mother and  Alexandra are proud of you, I was just said to transmit you that.”  Helena a little in surprise, I could actually feel, deep inside her, am  amazement she tried to control and keep out sight.

&#x200B;

”It is ok, you are  among friends. You can be less stiffy now. You among friends.” I took  her hand again. She did not oppose this, but seemed still confused,  somewhat. ”Welcome back to the good guys.” And I did one of the most  terrifying and most warm things I did so far in my life: I hugged her.  She looked startled, so I whispered in joy: ”That is hug. Please hug me  back, this is how people do.” She, reluctantly, hugged me back, I never  felt anything so weird, yet so existentially gratifying, I look back  into her eyes. She could not believe it herself, I guess.

&#x200B;

Father  George came and talked to her a long. I could hear him say to her:  ”What you did tonight, if if not truly Christian, but you see to be on  the right path. If you want, I shall guide you, as priest of Christ and a  confessor. Help as for you know. But I shall not rush you, we can wait  if you want.” It felt a bit rushed, yet. She looked at us, and went out  the gate. I told her: ”We know where you are.” She stopped, looked at us  awkwardly. Not menacing, not angry, not aggressive. My guess is that  she just did not knew what to do, so to say. And she need to be on her  own private space. I can not blame her at all.

&#x200B;

The  police came, eventually. I said I had got a tip about the kidnapping in  that area and that we witnessed a fight with a rival clan, and that  those killed all the people there. I also mentioned the visit to the  police earlier the same day. The incident made headlines to some days,  but Helena was never mentioned, we never said anything, nobody made a  connection with the incident of Marcel that was starting to get  forgotten. The Rumegush clan found a new leader in a few days, who  started a war with another clan, who he taught responsible for the death  of Cougar and the rest. The doctor was whitewashed by the media as a  victim of a clan war.

&#x200B;

I  quit my job in a few days, then started to look a new job, perhaps on a  call center shall be available. It will be much lesser paid, but my  conscious will be clearer. Not just that I promised Helena, or the  father George, but for myself first of all. I shall start a vlog on  Youtube on political, social and economical issues (in Romania, of  course) in the next days, as I am still known in the public eye and the  ”incident” is still fresh to the public. Of course, I shall speak  nothing of Helena or the supernatural things like that, or urban legends  of any kind in there.

&#x200B;

We  waited a few days, to get some rest. I went to the lair of Helena for a  few days, not close to the gate, but nearby. No sign of her, in the  first days. Then, I so the lights go out, in a familiar pattern. I left,  to leave her some space, for now.

&#x200B;

So,  that night, finally, came. We drove father George to the area. After we  parked, we got to Helena„s place.  Adrian stopped a bit and asked father George: ”Yet, can she confess? Isn„t she dead?” Father George chuckled with a bid of anger: ”She has a breath. A heartbeat. She can feel and relate like a living person. I have seen dead souls, they are very different. I am sure she counts very much as alive.” And knocked at the gate. Adrian was  feeling anxious, more then me, I guess I had got use to it, somehow.  Father George was the calmest, he said he had experience far more tough  situations. We knocked. Nothing happened, the first time. The second  time we knocked, after a little time, the light went out. Pretty, Helena  came out and opened the gate. Adrian trembled, but try to look strong. I  slowly caressed him on the hand. Helena was scary, as usual, but  tonight, as she stayed silent, like the times before, she looked anxious  herself, although in her own way. Her white eyes were not blank, but  like trying to avoid looking her in the eye.

&#x200B;

I  have tried to give the best smile that was both sweet, but controlled  and said: ”Hello Helena. We have come, like we promised. Can we come  in?:” Helena looked at us in silence, tilting her head a little to the  left, somewhat like dogs sometimes do. She moved away from the gate,  allowing us to get it. ”Thank you.” I said. She closed the gate behind  us, and I admit that moment made me and, especially Adrian, to get a  little startled. The whole house and yard were in darkness. She opened  the door and made us a sing to enter. In silence. We did, with all the  fear we had.

&#x200B;

Inside  was an old house, with old objects, many of them really antiquities.  Little to no new objects. I guess Helena got rid of them after Niculina  died. It all felt like being at a wake of grandma or some aunt, years  ago, as a child. For US readers, wakes are held in many parts of the  world, including in here, in the home of the deceased, not at a funerary  home. Relatives come and stay with the deceased. Lights were on. But,  on this occasion, all light was out. Only little little came from  outside. Yeah, it felt like a wake were people sit with the dead in the  dark, for some weird reason. In fact, the whole house seemed like an  embalmed corpse put on display on such a wake. There were three rooms,  in the middle there was a coffin, with the seals open. In rest,  everything was neatly, almost formally taken care. of. Like a museum or  something. But that coffin showed that the person in this house slept  there, not in bed (this was confirmed later).

&#x200B;

In  the last room, there was a bed, some old wooden chairs and some old,  wooden table. Helena, kinda reluctantly, showed us to sit. I looked at  her in the dark room, on the little light that came from outside. And I  said to myself: ”Yeah, this night shall nightmare fuel for years to  come. But I am glad I am here.” Since silence continued, I did my best  to smile and asked: ”So, Helena, how are you? Ok?” She did not replied  at first, but, eventually she did, like she was a little shy and tired:  ”Ok, I guess,” I did not know what to say, so I continued, a little  proud of me: ”You know, I kept my promise to you that I shall change. I  quit my job and now, I shall try to tell the actual truth on YouTube.  About all I can. I am determined.” Helena replied slowly., like she  tried herself to find the best tone, whole she avoided eye contact  again: ”Good for you.”

&#x200B;

Father  George opened with priest briefcase and got a bottle of alcohol. He  smiled and placed on the table: ”I have heard you enjoy strong spirits,  like pălinca. So, I brought you some anason raki, the one I myself  enjoy.” He waited some moments but, as Helena did not answered, he  continued: ”Could you be kind and bring some small glasses, please?”  Helena went to the other room and brought tzuika glasses. Father George  gave us all some shot and we enjoyed it. It had a strong flavor, I  admit, but I am not into strong drinks.

&#x200B;

We  drank in silence, darkness, in fear and in hope. Eventually, father  George broke the silence gently: ”So, do you think you are ready? I am  here to help you confess your sins. Do not worry, I shall help you, I  know it is pretty difficult, unbelievable difficult. But, if you  succeed, al your sins will be forgiven. No mater how hard they are. You  will be free. I shall ask you and, if there is anything else, you say it  then. Would you want to?” She looked reluctantly. Like she could not do  it, but something in here would want to. ”You know what.” said father  George. ”I shall say the prayers for the beginning of the sacrament, if  you are no ok, you can always back off. Those are said before the  confession itself. We try it. Is that ok?:” Helena looked at him and,  finally whispered: ”Ok.”

&#x200B;

So,  father George said the prayer for all us present, placing the  epitrachelion on the head of Helena, then invited me and Adrian out. I  felt somewhat anxiety to leave him alone with that monster, but I said a  prayer and went out. Me and Adrian were silent for a while, then we  started talking things like our bills, our long friendship, of how  beautiful is the night without artificial light... An hour to pass?  Until father George came out.

&#x200B;

He  seemed cheerful. We went to him and I asked: ”How did it was?” He  replied: ”You that I can not say what she said. But I can say it went  well. She can be a real sweetheart, if she wants.” We came in. The  atmosphere, the feeling was mostly, the same. Only that, in this wake,  it was like, although there is sadness because of the loss, there is  also peace. A bitter peace, but peace.

&#x200B;

Helena sit on her chair again,  with the head slightly to the ground. So I said, a little joyful: ”I  heard it went well. Am I right?” She looked at me, but this time replied  faster, more clearer, more normal, more human: ”It seems so.” I looked  at her. Now, besides all the she was just an hour earlier, she was  something else. She like, childlike, like a child ready to explore the  world. And live. When caution and baby steps, but yet... Her cheek bone  seem a little more visible, a little more lifelike. A little more like  you see in a child. Yep, it seems now that she can be a sweetheart, if  she wants. So, I dared to asked here, taking her hand: ”So, I guess we  can now be friends. Is it ok for you?” She looked at me childlike, and  she giggled a little sweet: ”Yes, I think so.”

&#x200B;

Ruxandra out.

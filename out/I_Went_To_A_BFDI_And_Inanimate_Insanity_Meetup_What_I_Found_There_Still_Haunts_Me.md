So, let me start with the basics. “What is BFDI and Inanimate Insanity?”, you may be asking. Well, BFDI (short for Battle For Dream Island) is a YouTube animated web series about 20 anthropomorphic objects competing for a single prize, the titular Dream Island, a luxury land that any living being can ever dream of having, hence the name. The first season lasted for 25 episodes with the contestant Firey being the sole winner before his prize got stolen from Leafy out of revenge for not being let in. The second season, BFDIA (Battle For Dream Island Again) was the second season of the series that lasted for 5 episodes before being cancelled. The third season, IDFB (I have no idea what those initials are short for) lasted for only one episode before it got expanded to the first part of the fourth season titled BFB (Battle For BFDI) before splitting off into two new seasons due to Four’s (BFB’s host) rival, Two, persuading nearly all the contestants to switch over to his own show, which soon branched off into the soon-to-be fifth season, TPOT (The Power Of Two). What remained of BFB became known as Battle For BFB as a result of Four changing the prize of the fourth season from a BFDI (an archived history of the show in a whole) into a BFB (an upgraded version that also contains current happenings within the fourth season). The fourth season would go on for 14 more episodes until Flower would end up winning and Four, who was depicted as a psychopathic algebralien (that’s the name of the species he’s part of, believe it or not), turning over a new leaf. Inanimate Insanity is basically the first famously known BFDI clone to exist. So far, only season 1 had concluded with Orange Juice (OJ for short) being the winner and using his one billion dollars to open a hotel. The second season stopped broadcasting after the final four, and I’m just guessing now that it got cancelled for the time being to make way for the current third season. These two shows would soon spark a trend that now became known as the Object Show Community (OSC for short)

With all that explained, let me get to the introductions. My name’s Erik Gregory Nelson. I am 13-years-old and a huge fan of the Object Show Community. My favorite object shows were BFDI and Inanimate Insanity. I would often watch them with my older brother, Allan. He was a big fan of the community as well. Hell, he even made some object show OCs himself. The two of us often dreamed of getting to meet Jacknjellify and AnimationEpic, the creators of BFDI and Inanimate Insanity. And on June 8, 2018, we would finally get our chance. Me and my brother were searching on YouTube for to see if any new episodes of BFB and/or Inanimate Insanity II (the name of the second season of Inanimate Insanity) were posted. And upon looking on AnimationEpic’s channel, we saw it: a video titled, “Inanimate Insanity & BFDI Crossover!? - L.A. MEETUP ON 6/24/18”. We clicked on it to start the video. The video itself starred Michael Huang (one of the creators of Jacknjellify) and Adam Katz (one of the creators of AnimationEpic) talking about their meetup that’s taking place somewhere in Los Angelos.

Seeing this, me and Allan were super stoked on finally getting to meet the creators of our favorite object shows that molded the OSC. Now, normally a child in this situation would have to ask their parents if they could go to Los Angelos to meet their YouTube heroes, but I lived with my brother at the time, who was 24-years-old, so he had enough money for passports, plane tickets, a hotel room for two, and a rental car. After packing up our stuff for the trip, we made sure we wrote down the questions we wanted to ask them, since they said they would be answering only one from each attendee. My question was gonna be about Paintbrush and Lightbulb’s possible romantic relationship. My brother was gonna ask them if Four had psychopathy. We drove over to the airport, purchased our passports and plane tickets, and began our flight to Los Angelos. It took a good five hours for us to get there, but the wait was worth it. We grabbed our luggage and rented our vehicle. We drove over to a hotel nearby a spot that was seemingly reserved for the BFDI and Inanimate Insanity Meetup. Allan paid for a vacant room stay for several weeks. Upon entering our rooms, I began unpacking until something caught my eye. Outside our room’s window was the meetup space. Inside was a group of people wearing cloaks and what I believed to be bull masks. They were holding hands with seven children. I felt a little uneasy. I guess Allan noticed my expression because a second later he came up to me. “Hey, Erik,” he asked, “what’s the matter?”. I pointed out to the window. 

He looked at my direction, and I saw his expression change to that of confusion. “What the hell?” My brother was prone to swearing. It was at the point that I’ve grown accustomed to it. It my brother’s swearing that got him kicked out the house, but I refused to let my brother be thrown out, so I told my parents that he goes, then so was I. And sure enough, I was sacked out the house for standing up to them. My parents were your typical strict stereotypes, but enough about them. The cloaked, masked people’s appearance alone were unsettling, and the fact they were holding hands with seven children was alarming enough to call the police for trespassing and probably even kidnapping, but what shocked me the most were the children’s expressions. They seemed to be genuinely happy. They probably thought they were going to have an exclusive look at the creators of the two shows. One of the strange individuals opened up what looked like a door. It was dark outside at the time, so I couldn’t tell what exactly what the door looked like yet. I would have to wait until the meetup to find out. The other cloaked people began leading the children through the other side of the door while the kids seemed to laugh. I didn’t hear their laughter, but I could identify that they were based on their movements. I’m a very observant child. 

On the day of the meetup, Allan and I entered the now-publicly available reserved meetup spot. We decided to keep the incident we saw last night to ourselves because, honestly, who would believe us when we told them what we saw. At the meetup, we saw Michael and Cary Huang, Satomi Hinatsu, Adam Katz, and Taylor Grodin. They were answering your typical questions about the show: “When will the next episode of BFB come out?”, “Why can’t MePhone4 recover Bow?”, and “Will Firey and Leafy ever make up?” Stuff like that. Then, I decided to ask my question. I raised my hand up, and I was called on. “Are Lightbulb and Paintbrush in a relationship?” I asked. “No,” Adam said, “they’re just friends.” I was a little disappointed by this, especially since I shipped those two. As the attendees continued to ask their questions, I saw a strange looking door to my right. It was painted blue and had an engraving of a bull’s head surrounded by seven flames. I instantly remembered the masked individuals and the seven children that I saw that night. Then, something hit me. I looked up behind me. There was the hotel me and my brother were staying at and the window of our room. That door was the same door the children were taken to. I looked at my brother, Allan. “Hey, Allan.” Nothing. “Allan?” Again, nothing. I waved my hand in front of his face. Nothing. I got really annoyed by this point. I positioned my face in front of his view of the meetup. Nothing. In fact, he didn’t even show any sign of noticing that he saw me. He didn’t even blink when I came in front of his face.

It was like I wasn’t even there to begin with. I looked at the guy I font of me. “Hello, sir?” No reply. I pulled on his shirt. He never budged. It was as if he was literally glued to the pavement. I did everything to get someone to notice me. Anything, but no one ever noticed. It was then that I felt something. A strange force that I don’t know how to even describe. Whatever it was, it was compelling me to enter the door. I couldn’t fight back or resist: only obey. I walked towards the blue door. It was there that I noticed something else that was engraved at the door: two words imprinted on a plaque: “Members Only”. The strange force compelled me into opening the door. Behind the door was a steep staircase leading down to darkness. I was forced to walk down the stairs. The descent itself was long and took nearly hours (at least it felt like hours). My heart began to pound relentlessly as I continued my trek. As more time passed by, I picked up a foul stench. It was unlike anything I ever smelt before. If I had to compare it to anything I did smell, however, it would be similar to rotten eggs, except magnified about seven times. As I climbed down the final step, I found myself in a seemingly endless hallway. On each wall were doors. One adjacent to the one on the other side. On each door was a name. I walked to some of them and read them: “Firey”, “Paintbrush”, “Lollipop”, “Yellow Face”. I recognized them instantly: those were the names of the contestants on BFDI and Inanimate Insanity. “Was this made for the event?” I wondered. I continued down my trek towards the hallway as I passed by more doors with contestant names. “Marshmallow”, “Yin-Yang”, “Golf Ball”, “Eraser”, “Four”.

I stopped at my pace when I saw that. I was at the last door on the right which was labeled “Four”. Last time I checked, Four was a host, not a contestant. I guess the people who made this wanted to pay tribute to Four as well as the other contestants. And if so, why not do the same with MePhone4, X, Announcer, MePad, Toilet, Two, or even Purple Face? I was now left with more questions than answers. I opened the door to the room. It was completely dark inside. No lights what so ever. The smell of rotten eggs was much stronger in here that I had to cover my nose. I looked around, using the light from the hallway as my only way to see the room. I saw what appeared to be a swing set with framed in the shape of the Greek numeral Omega. Next to it was a sandbox. In it was your typical sand and a stained knife. Why the hell would anyone keep a knife in a sandbox. The stain itself was black and oozed slowly along the blade. It reeked of a horrid stench that was equivalent to decay itself. I turned away from the knife, hoping to ignore the horrendous smell. There, in the darkness, were a pair of eyes looking right at me. I felt compelled to walk towards it, but this time I managed resist, but who was this person? Just I asked myself that, it spoke. 

“Hello?” it asked in what sounded like a frightened voice. I didn’t know what to do. It spoke again. “Who are you?” “My name’s Erik,” I told it. “Oh, well hi, Erik,” It stammered. “What are you doing here?” I asked it. “I live here.” At first, I found it hard to believe what he said was true. How can anyone live in this stink-filled wasteland? “Where are your parents?” “I don’t have any.” At that point, I began to feel bad for this guy. I couldn’t imagine being parent less and having to live in a horrible-smelling underground bunker of some sort. “What’s your name?” I asked him. “Me? I’m just a nobody.” It said sadly. “No you’re not. Everybody has a name. Surely you must have one as well.” “Well, just one.” At that point, I began to wonder why his voice sounded so familiar. I heard it somewhere before, but I couldn’t put my finger on it. Then, it spoke: “My name’s Four. Four from BFDI.” I was shocked in bewilderment. “No you’re not. Four is a fucking cartoon character. He’s not real!” I told the stranger. “Do you like it here in my home? Do you want to stay in my home?” Soon, it got up. I realized at that moment that its eyes weren’t far away. I never had any idea how big they fucking were. From the light of the hallway, I saw a blue, clawed hand grab the knife from the sandbox. “Do you want to see a magic trick. I’m very good at magic tricks.” The next thing I heard were the sounds of flesh being sliced off, meat being torn off, and bones cracking and snapping. I could smell the putrid metallic smell of blood emanating from the room. I immediately vomited all over the floor as the man butchered himself.

I backed out of the room and bumped into the door adjacent to Four’s room. This door was the only one I never got to read the name of. I turned around to see it. To this day I wish I hadn’t. The name read, “Erik Gregory Nelson”. My name was on that door. As soon as I saw my name, I was turned around by... that thing. It looked like Four from BFDI, but those features will always stick in my head. His arms were twice as long as its body, lacerations with black substances oozing out of them covering every aspects of it. Its clawed hands had black ooze all over it. Its lower half of its legs were in similar structure as one of those lower leg bones (whatever they were called), also covered in black oozing lacerations. It was nightmarishly bipedal. Its body looked painfully thin that you could see its rib cage. Much of the torso was stained in that black ooze. The head, oh god the head, was the worst. It had a humanoid shaped head with two elongated horns protruding from its forehead and one just above its left ear. Its nose was completely absent. Instead, all there was in its place was a gaping hole. The part that haunted me most were the eyes. The right eye was dangling out, completely black. However, the left eye glowed a color that I’ve never seen before. I can’t bring myself to describe it, but I can still see it when I look back at it. It spoke in its innocent, squeaky voice: “Don’t you want to play with the others?” Soon, the room behind him light up. What I saw horrified me: there were the seven children I saw that night, all naked and tied up to seven stakes and lit on fire. The engraving of the same bull’s head from the blue door that led me in here were all carved on their chests.

The burning children’s eyes opened and began to laugh. I had enough of this madness, so I turned back to where I had entered and began running. As I passed each door, I heard each and every one of them open behind me. I didn’t dare turn back to see what ungodly abomination has decided to follow me. I continued running until I finally found the stair case that brought me here. I began climbing up them in a rush, hoping that whatever it was following me would lose me. It toke several minutes, but I finally reached the top. I ran through the door and into my brother. He hugged me as I began crying on him. “Are you alright, Erik?” It took a while to form a single sentence. “I almost died in there!” I managed to say through my tears. I looked around me and saw police officers surrounding the property of the meetup. I was a bit confused at this sight, but I was just happy to see my brother and out of that god awful place. However, when I turned back to the door, my relief turned into dread. A four-armed, humanoid with a bull head was staring back at me from the staircase. And on its chest was a single name carved into it: “Moloch”.

27 Days Later...
It’s been weeks since my encounter with that thing at the BFDI and Inanimate Insanity Meetup. I told my brother what I saw and experienced. Normally, people wouldn’t believe these kinds of things, but I never lied to anyone, and he believed me. He called the people who preserved the spot for the meetup and asked them if they knew anything about an underground chamber, but they said there were no such door around the place. When we looked at some footage on YouTube, there was no blue door to be found. Even weirder, I couldn’t be found on any of those footages. I’ve also been having nightmares lately. Nightmares of that demonic Four. He was butchering the contestants in inhumane ways, morphing them into ungodly versions of their former selves. The nightmares would always end with that bull-headed, quadruple-armed being showing up and whispering in my ear the same thing: “Come back and play with us.” But the one thing that stood out was the name on that thing’s chest: “Moloch”. It sounded familiar. I think I might do some research on this thing.

2 Weeks Later...
So, I’ve done some research, and I came across a horrifying discovery. Apparently, Moloch is The God Of Child Sacrifice in Caanite religion. This earned this entity a reputation in Muslin, Jewish, and Christian religion as a demon that preys on children. There’s even a ritual that Caanite worshippers would perform to please Moloch. They would take seven children and burn them alive in seven separate bonfires to prevent future disasters from happening. This ritual even became a subject for some conspiracy theories. So from I experienced, I was nearly taken by a child-eating demon through a member of one of its legion in the form of a demonic Four from BFDI. 

3 Days Later...
I can’t do it. I can’t take it anymore. I saw him. I saw Moloch and his legion in my dream again. I was in a realistic version of Goiky Canal from BFDI, but instead of grass, the ground was made of flesh. The sky was red and the clouds were black. The trees were made of bones and organs. Moloch was standing in the midst of a vast bloody ocean. He was fucking huge. I saw the demon Four and the rest of Moloch’s legion. They looked like the contestants of BFDI and Inanimate Insanity, But their forms were twisted and horrific. These things were tossing mangled, still-living children into Moloch’s mouth. As he munched on the children, I could hear the, scream in pain and agony. I woke later on with a scream. There, on my bedside table was a note written in black ooze. It smelled like the same ooze I found in that corridor at the meetup. And that’s not the worst part. The worst part was that my address was on it. I don’t know how those beasts figured out where I lived or if they followed me home, but I know I’m in danger of being Moloch’s next meal. There’s only one way to foil this thing’s plan, but I’m afraid of how it will effect my family. To my parents, I’m sorry I chose my brother over you. I just couldn’t imagine living a life without him. You two also brought me happiness, and you taught me everything had to know, but I’m afraid that my existence will by the one thing this deity wants in order to grow. And to my brother, Allan, I love you. I’l always remember all the good times we had together. So don’t be sad that we’ll no longer be together. Instead, be happy of what we did together all of those times. And remember, I’ll always be in your heart. As my tears fall from my face, I end my posts here. Goodbye.

3 hours later, Erik Gregory Nelson was found in his room with a noose tied to the ceiling fan wrapped around his neck by his older brother, Allan Harris Nelson, who dialed 911 for a pen emergency rescue. Erik was brought to the hospital for a desperate attempt in revival, but it was too late. Erik had lost all vitals at 3:00 PM. His story was seen on his laptop by Allan, who posted it online. He claimed to never believe in the supernatural, but he agrees that something happened to his brother on the day of the BFDI and Inanimate Insanity Meetup. The individuals mentioned in said story were never caught or identified. The door in question, once investigated by police, was investigated, resulting in the disappearance of half the SWAT team members. Cases of seven children disappearing still continue to this day.

Me and my husband have a child, she's about 5 months old.

We went out on a trip  to the woods a few weeks ago. When we went there, all hell arrived. For the 3 days that we were there, we had something... Watching us. I left my baby on the hands of a house keeper. She was a really sweet 15 year old kid. She had a good heart, and was really good with babies. She's actually the daughter of one of my best friends, Megan.


While we were camping, I always felt a presence behind me. My husband had an anxiety attack, and while we slept we hear whispers, the next day when we woke up, we found handprints on our tent.

When we decided to go back home, it seems that I've brought it with us. Every night, we hear whispers, When we wake up, we find scratch marks all over our walls. They seem... Inhumane, like they weren't make by a human.

The scratch marks seemed like they were made by an animal of some sorts. Whenever I wake up at midnight, I see it. A tall, slender humanoid figure. It has no eyes, a Voldemort nose, and large, frowning sort of face, like an upside down D. 

It was slim, it's ribcage was showing. Its skin is a sort of light grey colour, and has claws, as long as pencils. They were razor sharp. Everytime my husband moved, it went into attack mode, and would quickly shift to his side, watching over him. I was worried that if he moved again, I wouldn't see him the next day.

It watches over me, quickly shifting to my side of the bed, then my husband's, then at the end of the bed. It would exit the room, and the next second, my baby crying. I would rush over to my babies room, turn on the light, and it would disappear, in the blink of an eye.

I decided to buy a baby monitor. I installed a camera in my room, and bought a crucifix to put on my door. I would pray before bed every night, that it would go away, it doesn't. I bought a Bible, I read it out loud before bed every night, the whole book, it doesn't go away.

One night in particular, something happened. It didn't come to my room, but was instead in my babies. I saw through the baby monitor, the creature standing above my baby's cradle.Thats when I went into fight mode. I grabbed my husband's shotgun. I ran into my baby's room 

I shouted "GET AWAY FROM MY BABY YOU SICK FUCKER!" And I fired around 5 rounds before it would charge at me, I moved out of the way, and fired the last round at it. It ran into my fireplace which was still lit. It set on fire, and quickly ran out of my house.

The next night, it didn't come back, on the baby monitor, no sight of this creature. To make sure, I walked around my house with a shotgun, making sure it wouldn't come back. It didn't.

There's one problem though. Every night when I sleep, I get nightmares of it. Nightmares of what would happen if I never moved out of the way, if I never had that shotgun. If I was asleep during the time it was in my baby's room.

I get dreams it ate me while I sleeped. I went to a therapist for a few months, I'm alright now. I don't get dreams of him anymore, but I'll never forget, it's disturbing face, pale, grey body, and claws. Sometimes, I would have sleep paralysis, and have IT as my sleep paralysis demon.

Im able to deal with it, as long as the thought that it would not come back remains in my mind.

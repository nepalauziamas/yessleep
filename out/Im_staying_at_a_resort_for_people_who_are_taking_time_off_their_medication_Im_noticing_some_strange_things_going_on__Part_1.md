I grew up with three voices in my head. 

My name is Cal, and I have schizophrenia. It’s never been too bad, or hard, to live with it. My case isn’t severe; I rarely had hallucinations or paranoia, and the voices in my head came and went. I was around 12 years old when one of the voices, Ara, cemented herself in my head. She would talk to me about music, the flute mostly. She was extremely talkative, impossible to shut up. She would speak to me non-stop for days, then disappear for a few weeks, before returning for a few days, and so on. But she was pleasant. She was my friend. I miss her.

It wasn’t until I was 17 when I heard the third voice. The deep, husky growl that would radiate hatred through my head. His name was Mr. Sick. He was angry, mean. He told me to hurt people. Whenever he spoke, I panicked. It was so hard to ignore him when he was right there. He’s why I had to start the medication. Even though I knew he was evil, and I knew I had to ignore what he said to me, I was scared of what he might make me do. He was sinister.

So, at the age of 18, I started the medication. I haven’t heard any voices since, just my own. I take antipsychotics daily and a depot injection every few weeks. I’m 34 now and I feel great. There’s always been a part of me, however, that feels like I’m weaker because of it. Relying on medication makes me feel like I’m not normal; I want to be in control of myself, myself. So, I’ve signed up for a trial, of sorts, that may help me achieve that.

I heard the advertisement over the radio. I like listening to the radio; there's some twisted irony about hearing voices. It was advertised as a “Medication Vacation”. The advert claimed that after a month, I’d feel like a new person. So, I looked into it further. It’s basically a bunch of people, like me who are reliant on medication, that go and live in a resort for a month medication-free. Other forms of therapy are promised, but none involving pills or needles. The company running this is called ‘MedVars’. I filled out a form, stated my illness, and waited.

I heard back within the hour; they asked me about my history, the severity of my illness, the meds I was on. And that’s about it. I was accepted. I was told that it's a trial for potential future resorts to open around the country; a new form of rehab. This made it free of charge. 

Whilst nervous, I’m excited to prove to myself that *I’m* the main reason my illness has subsided, not the medication.

I pull my car into the resort parking lot. This place is in the middle of nowhere, desert. But it’s beautiful. I squint through the sunlight up at the foreboding entrance to the resort; its red stone towers over me as I push through its glass doors. I find myself in a large open waiting area; chairs and tables scattered in clusters around me. At the end of the room, a reception desk. I hastily walk toward it, rolling my suitcase behind me. Behind the desk stands a young man wearing a white jumpsuit, smiling at me. The word 'MedVars' is written in small font on the left breast of the jumpsuit.

“Good afternoon Sir,” he exclaims, “what is the name?”

“Hey man,” I respond, “Cal – Callum Sharper”.

A brief pause as he searches my name on the system, “Ah, yes! Mr. Sharper. Schizophrenic”.

“Uh. right,” I am taken aback by his approach; almost yelling my illness with excitement. But I continue, “where am I staying?”

He gives me a small guide, a map, of the resort. It’s mostly outside, and the place looks huge. The map reminds me of one I was given during a holiday in Bali years ago. In fact, the resort seems to be set up very similarly; beach resort vibes, each of the buildings separated by pathways outside. He highlights the reception area and draws a route to an area labelled, “Housing Area B”, telling me I’m in Number 4 and handing me a blank key.  

I thank him and make my way toward my room.

This place is magnificent. It’s a utopia in the desert; swimming pools, palm trees. The walk to my room is along a pool, currently empty, and passed a large building that, through its windows, resembles a dining hall. There are palm trees either side of each pathway, and the occasional employee wearing the same white jumpsuit as the man at reception greets me as I walk by. I reach housing area B.

There are multiple, small villas around a little central garden. I count four villas and determine that I’m in the one at the end; number 4. I approach the nifty, red building and slide my key into its door. Inside, an immediate living room area; although no TV, just couches and a small coffee table. Behind the couches, a large bookshelf packed with various, untitled books. The décor is simple yet satisfying; the red colour scheme gives me a feeling of warmth, safety. I leave my suitcase by one of the couches, and approach one of the doors towards the back. It leads to the bedroom. A king-sized bed sits against the far wall, bedside tables on either side; an old-school alarm clock sits on one of the tables and an induction manual on the other. I’ll read the manual later. I open the closet, it’s large, not that I’ll need much space anyway. Through a door at the far end of the bedroom, a patio. It overlooks the stretching desert sands beyond the resort, and it strikes me that my villa is situated right on the resort’s outskirts. 

I head back into the living room to see what’s through the other door; a bathroom, of course. The dark red marble feels cold to the touch as I brush my hand over the bathtub’s surface. Strangely, the bathroom has an alarm clock in it too; the same type as the one in my bedroom. I turn back into the living room to see if there’s one in there; sure enough, there rests one on the centre of the coffee table. Random, but I won’t complain; this is one of the nicest resorts I’ve ever been in.

I open the instruction manual after settling in. Inside, a welcome message from the head of MedVars, Miss Harper. It’s a standard welcome message. I flick the page and find the layout of what to expect during a normal day here; breakfast, compulsory trialling of different therapy methods, lunch, free time, counselling, free time, bedtime. It’s the kind of day I expected to have; the heavy stuff in the morning so that we can relax later in the day. However, bedtime at 8:30? What are we, kids? Nonetheless, I doubt that’s enforced, and flick the page.

‘Counselling’ is the next header. The manual informs me that each ‘participant’ has been provided a counsellor for the month to determine progress and reaction to therapies. These sessions are to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the participants as well as the staff – making sure we’re not going too crazy without our meds. On this page, there is a separate, loose piece of paper with my name at the top. 

*Callum Sharper*

*Schizophrenic*

*Counsellor – Sandy Ford*

Right, so the counsellor I have is Sandy Ford. I look forward to meeting her. Not sure why they felt the need to remind me of my condition, but I turn the page.

The next heading, ‘Induction’. Induction is to take place today at 3pm by the time of the clocks provided in our rooms. I glance down at my watch, 2:23pm, then at the alarm clock on my bedside table, 2:25pm. I sync my watch and phone time with the clock’s and read on. 

‘The clocks provided will ring 10 minutes before you are expected, during which you should begin your walk to the Grand Hall.’

I scan the map; I realise I’ve not actually looked at it too deeply. The grand hall is a large building, just behind the dining hall that I saw on the way here. I note other buildings; changing rooms, employee living quarters, and housing areas A-E. At the edge of the map, the opposite of the side I’m staying on; a large, unlabelled square shaped building.

\-

The grand hall adopts the same red scheme I have seen throughout the resort. A tall ceiling overlooks the chairs that are set out and ordered in front of a large stage. There are uniformed employees along the hall walls, and about 25 to 30 of us now sitting in chairs. It’s still kind of awkward, none of us know anyone yet. But I’ve introduced myself to one guy, El, who I’m now sat beside. He’s a large man with scruffy facial hair to make up for the lack of hair on his head. He’s wearing cargo shorts and a flowery Hawaiian top - suited for this place. He has a hint of an accent, European I think, although I’m not sure. The lights around the room suddenly dim.

A large, foreboding figure emerges onto the stage; almost as if out of nowhere. Her black dress and  black fascinator provide a stark contrast to the all-white attire of the other employees. She hosts a stern look on her face as she approaches centre stage toward a speaking stand with a microphone.

“Good afternoon, I am Miss. Harper”, she bellows across the hall. “I will be overseeing your stay here very closely. You have each been carefully selected to ensure the best results. We are studying people who host an array of illnesses, in order to determine what works for what. It is *imperative*,” she says this with a snap, “that you all attend the sessions planned for you. They are for your own good. Please refer to the induction manuals in your rooms for further information. I will be living on-site; I am sure you have seen my quarters. Please refrain from entering anyone’s quarters, bar your own, and in turn we will refrain from entering yours. Follow the rules and be where you’re supposed to be and I’m sure you will leave here with more than you came. There will now be a sign-up session outside the hall, which will allow you to gain a brief understanding of the therapies we offer here before you choose which to partake in. Good day.”

She turns and walks off the stage, where some of the larger employees escort her out of the hall. We remain seated in silence, until one of the employees open the doors to the hall and calls for us to sign up for sessions.

For tomorrow, and thus the subsequent week, I've signed up for Art Therapy followed by Visual Therapy. I’m not sure what to expect, but I’m quite intrigued. There’s an ice breaker at reception soon, so I move to get ready. Before heading back to my room, I give myself a quick tour of the rest of the resort. Each housing area has the same layout as mine; villas surrounding a central piece such as a garden or small fountain. I am, however, surprised by the sheer size and overall aura of Miss Harper’s quarters, which I note is the unmarked building on the map. A large, black gate protects a large, black house which stands in the corner of the resort. Against the tropical vibe, this house feels wrong, out of place. Manning the gate, and subsequently the front door through the gate, two uniformed workers. Guards, I suppose.

As I walk by the guards, their gaze follows me. They smile, yet it doesn’t feel warm. They don’t even blink, their eyes never leaving me. I feel their gaze continue to burn into the back of my head as I walk away from them. I continue toward my room, passing more employees of the resort. They all smile at me as I pass, but none of them blink either. That’s weird, isn’t it? Wait, did the receptionist blink earlier? Did Miss. Harper- 

Stop. Stop imagining things. You’re overthinking and you’re going to make yourself paranoid.

I’ve only been off my meds for one day, I won’t let paranoia get to me. I’m better than this. I’m in control of myself. Me.

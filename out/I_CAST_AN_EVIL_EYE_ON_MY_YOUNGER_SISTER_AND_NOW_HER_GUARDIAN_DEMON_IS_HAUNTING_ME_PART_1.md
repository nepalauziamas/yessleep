May 6th - 2019

I am starting to write this journal/blog/series of entries to make sense of bizarre and suspiciously supernatural set of occurrences- to make sense of it all from a rational perspective. Since I need to elaborate on the background on the story this first entry may be a bit long, but hopefully it  would help me connect it all in the end. I initially started writing to be put out on a Freethinkers' forum on facebook but after having unsatisfactory explanations I felt this would be an avenue where I could get some better answers. But as you will learn the finality of the story still feels like a nightmare that has come to life. I can only wish it was only a nightmare. The starting and now, as it seems, the ending point of the story is not me but my sister, Pranathi. Sigh..

My little sister Pranathi is a compulsive liar. There doesn't go a day where she doesn't lie. I don't know where she got it from. It's not like we live in an abnormal family either. I am a 27 year old working in IT here in Hyderabad, India and working full time to stave off parents' demands for getting married year after year. My father runs an agarbatti - incense stick business and is hardly ever at home since his work takes him to Mysore often. And my mother works as a teacher. Both us daughters were raised with equal love and care. But then..sigh...

&#x200B;

I don't think she is a bad or a malicious kid. She's in 5th grade in DAV. She studies well- except for whenever she is not lying about her mark sheets and report card. And that is every time! The mistake I think was that we didn't think much of it. 'She is just a little girl' folks at home used to think. Not me of course. That father of mine- he has mainly spoiled her. Why does he pamper her like that? 'Chinnari chinnari' (little one) he calls her. Why is it not a big deal that your chinnari lies about her school summer camp and I have to pick her up leaving my work- why is it not a big deal deal that chinnari says that her class teacher turned into a ghost (dayyam as she calls it) and is scaring the students, which she illustrated in class too by the way. I still remember that drawing. The teacher looked like Shabana Azmi from that hindi movie Makdee. Gave me the creeps as well. Why is it not a big deal that chinnari lies about whether she came in school bus or autorickshaw? Or that dogs on the streets can talk to her and they all helped her reach home?

&#x200B;

I try to talk to her like a normal sister would you know- ask her what is happening in her life. She says nothing really happens. But where from do all these stories come from then? Sigh. I should stop ranting about her wild imaginations. And rather maybe, understand them? Or else that...thing... would come again. What that thing is something I may know as the entries progress.

&#x200B;

Since I started writing this journal only after the bizarre occurrences transpired I will try to recreate three separate entries from memory. Yes, I'm going that extra mile so that if I'm....no more... someone else may find this blog and hopefully piece together what is happening to me.

April 6th - 2019

&#x200B;

I had enough of this girl this day. It was the day of Ugadi. Considered the Telugu New Year. I'm not one for festivities but I don't mind them either. But the part I do complain about is the puja and other religious ceremonies that happen. My mother also loves to draw a muggu in front of the house even on this day. Folks from other parts of India may call it Rangoli. And if you don't know what that is- then google it. Mother finished the muggu and was doing preparations in the puja room. Father had some urgent work with seeing to a truck delivery and would come back just in time for aarthi ie. when the puja would be finished. Office did not me provide a holiday but I took a leave anyway. I was asked to see to all the little decorations around the house. So as you can imagine- utter chaos. Coming to Pranathi- she first lied about where the stone to break the coconut with was. Then about where the fruits that go as prasadam were. She ate two of the bananas that were meant for offering to the idols. I was already mad from the previous day because she lied that no report card was given at school. And what did she say when confronted? It was eaten up by the dogs on the way. Ughhhhhh.

&#x200B;

I get a call. It's from work. When I'm on leave?! seriously? It's noisy inside. So I step out the front door. Not even a minute passes since the songs calling for " Prithikaaaaa" start. I couldn't close the door since it needed to be open while the puja went on. I step further away. It's Prakash my project manager on the call. He needs me to verify some front-end code. My mind has no room for work right now. I see Pranathi stepping out, in her usual waltzy manner. She's looking at me. Prakash says the client wants the work done today. She is about to speak to me.

&#x200B;

"Amma wanth you to come insidh. Aalthi will starth soon..." she said in her lisp-y self.

I put Prakash on hold. "Tell her I got a call from office. It'll take a while"

"She wanth you to come now"

"What, can't you see I'm on a call??"

I turn away and bargain deadlines with Prakash. Pranathi waltz her way inside, this time stepping on the muggu while doing so. Not just the side, but the center, strewing about all the color patterns.

"Ayyy!! Oh sorry wasn't shouting at you Prakash."

&#x200B;

A minute later when the call ends I turn around to the front of the house where my mother is staring at me, wrists on her hips, furious at me.

&#x200B;

"What happened?" I asked.

"What do you mean what happened? I spent 3 hours this morning while you were having your beauty sleep drawing this pattern for the muggu and you just step on it like that?!"

"No it wasn't me."

"Puja is going on but you can't afford to not be on your phone?? Nice now even your father is here." she remarks, looking into the distance.

&#x200B;

I turn back to see nanna being dropped off by a lorry. Being dropped off by Yadayya. His main driver who tranports bulk of his goods.

"What is the altercation right in the morning. Arey rey.." he remarks looking down on the spoilt muggu.

"I worked 3 hours on this. Followed a youtube video to the last detail"

"How did this happen?" my father asked.

"It wasn't me."

"Pranathiiii!!" my father called her outside. She comes out, without a care in the world. She is careful to NOT step on the muggu and hugs her father.

"Pranathi how did this happen?" my mother is insistent.

"Akka. She was busy on phone", Pranathi said.

"What? No!"

"Arey we all have work sometimes. These things happen. Did you take a picture of it on your phone once you finished it?" asked my father.

"Yes" said my mother.

"Then leave it."

My mother didn't say anything further. But her look of contempt conveyed everything she wanted to say. Nanna took Pranathi inside, who didn't even peek a look in my direction.

&#x200B;

I was internally furious. That....ughhh.

I walk closer to the entrance. I see inside. Amma has gone into the puja room. Nanna was picking up Pranathi who was playing with the leaves that were kept as decorations along the walls.

&#x200B;

My mind then went to a darker place. That wretched little demon. That conniving bitch. And she does it all in such a nonchalant manner. She knew I didn't do it, and she knows she stepped on it. I can see color marks on her bare foot. Were my parents blind as well? Spoilt her enough to be--her. Just drop on her head and be done with it!

&#x200B;

\[\[THUD\]\]

&#x200B;

Something big, blue and what I thought were a bunch of sharp teeth fell right in front of me.

&#x200B;

"Prithikaa!" Everyone rushes outside. I see and observe the large object that would have landed on my head and have injured me severely if I had inched closer.

&#x200B;

On the floor- I got a good look at what that thing was. It's an object. This object is called by multiple names.'Cheshm Nazar', 'Nazar Gorboni', 'Nazar Battu, 'Bedaru Bombe', 'Dishti Bomma'- called differently in different languages- it 'adorns' the front of our house. Here this object is a hard coconut shell painted with a rakshasa's face. It is kept to ward off the evil eye and other evil spirits. I never noticed it on top of the entrance to my house, but there it was.  With a shade of blue to show skin with eyes that are red and yellow. I used to think it was well colored considering dishti bommas look a lot more overdrawn, usually. It was gifted to the family by my peddananna (mother's elder brother) on his Cambodia trip. Shortly after which he died. He really liked chinnari. Sigh. Anyway who would give that as a gift?? You could have gifted me a new phone, Peddananna. Instead you bring this to accidentally fall on my head. Well, almost. Needless to say, I find nothing good about that face now.

&#x200B;

Was it a coincidence? I pray that it is. Needless to say, aarthi did not happen that day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

April 13th - 2019

&#x200B;

Since that day I have fallen particularly ill. I have taken 'leave' from office. I say leave in quotes because I still have to work from home even if it is sick leave. One would think that taking rest from home would help my fever but it has been progressively getting worse. I'm not stupid enough to connect this to the events of that day since I've had no time to go to the doctor as well. My company has not been doing well so I have been feeling the crunch from the workload. I'm also seeing Pranathi more often since I'm at home and that really throws me off mood. Come to think of it I have not spoken to her since. Why would I? But something peculiar happened tonight.

&#x200B;

Since I'm sick I've been trying to sleep in a separate room. Currently my ammamma's (grandmother's) room since she died about a year ago and it has since been unoccupied. God forbid 'chinnari' catch a fever from me right? Good for me I wouldn't be sleeping in the same room as her and listening to her made up fantasies. The sickness although doesn't let me sleep well. Tonight I was rolling around in bed, unsuccessful at sleep when I started to hear noises from Pranathi's room. To...whatever imaginary friend she made up that day. But tonight...I think...I heard a voice answer back in return. That alerted me but I knew that Pranathi is known to modulate her voice when role-playing so I didn't think much of it. "Ah that little demon is just conversing with herself" I thought. So I walked up-to her room. The door was closed. I could hear voices inside. Voices. Plural. I knew I was tired but I definitely heard two voices simultaneously in there. And both voices seemed like... Pranathi's. Okay so she is talking to herself. But it felt like her voices were coming from....different points of the room at the same time. Totally weirded out, I slammed on her door.

&#x200B;

"People are trying to sleep here, okay! You are free to ruin yours but don't ruin mine!" I said angrily, but not too loudly of course. The voices now stopped. I get back to my room to resume my unsuccessful attempt at getting some sleep.

&#x200B;

I hear her room door creaking. What is she doing now?? I get up and open my room door to see a cold faced Pranathi at the entrance of my room, staring at me.

&#x200B;

"Akka, thele is a cat in the garden."

&#x200B;

"What are you even doing in the garden?? Weren't you in your room just now?"

&#x200B;

"Come see!" She holds me by the hand and leads me to the staircase. Her face is expressionless. Oddly, the blabbermouth is just a girl of few words right now. The rooms below were not in total darkness because there is usually a dimmer light-bulb controlled by a switch by the bottom of the stairs. I look downstairs. The front door was open. Also I must inform that Indian houses do not have porches but a light source is usually installed toward the outside, right above the front door. And that light-bulb tonight was switched on. Did someone get in?? On high alert, I descend down slowly.

&#x200B;

"Just go it's in the garden!" Pranathi coldly exclaimed.

&#x200B;

"Did YOU open the door?" I asked as I descended about four steps.

&#x200B;

"The cath wath knocking." she said. My heart was now beating fast.

&#x200B;

"Pranathi, tell me who knocked" I hissed.

&#x200B;

"Cath knocked. I opened. It lan off into galden".

&#x200B;

"Pranathi, this is serious. Who knocked on the door?" I had two more steps to get to ground floor.

&#x200B;

"Aley you can hear the cat in the garden". This time she was suddenly right behind me. I yanked myself forward toward the front door. After adjusting myself I looked out from behind the open door. A few blades of grass were visible in the lawn by the bulb. But beyond that, blackness. Pranathi was holding my hand, looking outward. After a few seconds of listening to crickets chirping, I heard it. The purring of a cat. Pranathi suddenly leaves my hand and rushes into the dark ahead.

&#x200B;

"Pranathi!" I exclaim and rush forward. Suddenly a blue head drops in front of me. I trip backward and fall.

&#x200B;

I saw two glowing eyes suspended in air- staring back at me . I was about to shriek any second.

&#x200B;

I think a second later some blood streamed into my brain and my...rationalist mind kicked in for me to see what was going on. It's the dishti bomma. This time suspended in air and facing me just beyond the front door. My mind, only human, had been startled. The rakshasa (demon) face was painted on with a certain kind of dye that reflects heavily when light falls on it- here the one coming  from the bulb situated above the front door. And it wasn't tied properly so the rope gave way. My mind then adjusted to the fact that the door was still open. And Pranathi was just standing outside it. Staring at me.

&#x200B;

"What happened to the cat now?" I asked.

"Ith went off" she said.

"Liar"

"Plomise ith ran away!"

&#x200B;

I pulled her inside. I live in a big gated complex with one security guard about a kilometer away from the front gate but that also meant that each individual house does not have its own security. We don't even have any immediate neighbors. So I need to be alert. After a glance outside I quickly closed the door. I closed it over the hanging, glowing eyes. I switched off the front door light.

&#x200B;

I listened for a while for any other sounds. Then I hissed again at Pranathi. "Don't just venture off into the dark like that!"

&#x200B;

After taking her upstairs I keep pestering about who knocked on the door. She gave the usual reply.

&#x200B;

"So you are lying about the knock on the door also then." I sighed.

&#x200B;

"No akka..."

&#x200B;

A loud voice comes from the other room. It's Amma.

&#x200B;

"Will you girls even sleep. What panchayat you folks are holding in the middle of the night??"

&#x200B;

"Do this again I will wake up Amma and tell her"

&#x200B;

"But I didn't do anything...."

&#x200B;

With a heavy sigh I go back to my room. After a while, sleep did creep in owing to my sheer exhaustion. The voices commenced in the other room but I was too tired.

&#x200B;

To recall, the bomma was angled pretty perfectly to face me, was it not?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

April 27th - 2019

&#x200B;

I've been trying to avoid looking or talking to Pranathi even at dinner times. "Hello akka" she says over the dinner table, even though I try not to respond. Does she not get the message? Maybe she does this on purpose. My fever's gone and I have resumed going to work but I am still sleeping in my grandma's room. I still hear the voices at night from time to time. So it was a bit strange that whatever transpired tonight even did. My skeptic mind is hard at work trying to unpack whatever it is I saw. If I do it, it will be updated in the next journal entry.

&#x200B;

Work has been stressing me out so I do come back home tired. The tiredness helps me go to bed as soon as I hit it, voices or no. Tonight....I heard a gentle knock on my door. Don't know how many times it was knocked on since I slept. I finally wake, drowsy. I open it. Stone-cold Pranathi again. No, she had a little smirk.

&#x200B;

"Cat came downthairs."

&#x200B;

"What? Are you mad? Why did you bring it in??"

&#x200B;

"Aley I didn'th. It's alleady there."

&#x200B;

"Stop lying, tell me where you found it!!"

"I just thaw it in the living loom. Mothel dead plomise!" she said with a hand on her head.

Instinctively, I take the hand off her head. "Don't make promises like that!" I scowl.

&#x200B;

Knowing full well she just sneaked a cat in, I walked to the edge of the staircase again and looked down. It was pitch black this time. The dim bulb that alights the bottom floor past bedtime has not been turned on this time.

&#x200B;

My eyes quickly try to locate the switch in the dark. The switch for this bulb is by the bottom of the staircase. Curiosity they say killed the cat. I walk slowly down the stairs in darkness. A part of me on edge.

I look back at Pranathi who hasn't descended with me.

&#x200B;

"Where is the cat? I don't see it."

&#x200B;

"Ith a black cat you can't thee ith in the dark"

&#x200B;

"Joke ah?" I quip. She doesn't respond.

&#x200B;

It was awfully quiet, I noticed. I could hear myself breathing. Although only mine, no-one else's. A note to the readers at this point- the logic of a drowsy mind does not make much sense, even to the person conjuring up the thoughts and the logic behind said thoughts.

&#x200B;

Halfway down the stairs....I see them. Right before where the front door should be. Glowing eyes. I could feel them staring right at me. They were transfixed on my movement as I descended down slowly.

&#x200B;

"So there is a cat after all!" I say and turn back. Pranathi isn't there any more. Strange.

&#x200B;

I look back again. The eyes are still there. Now I could recognize these weren't cat eyes. It's a different....glow.

&#x200B;

Wait, this was the same glow from few nights ago. My mind after momentary pondering- gave me an answer. Ah, it's the eyes of the dishti bomma. From beyond the front door. I just blamed this erroneous observation on my drowsiness and completely descended the stairs. I was feeling the wall on the right side. I found the switch. I just had to turn it on.

&#x200B;

I proceeded to not turn it on considering the fact that this Schrödinger's cat inside the house might get startled by a sudden light. Plus my eyes were getting accustomed to the dark. My mind then brought up a question. Was I sure it was only a cat? Why was this light switched off? Amma never forgets to switch it on after dinner. Did somebody switch it off? Or...did an intruder get inside the house that night and is still hiding somewhere? This jolted me up and my drowsiness vanished. I look around. The dishti bomma's eyes were certainly apparent in the dark.

&#x200B;

It hit me then. THE FRONT DOOR IS CLOSED. There is no light source for me to be able to see what I am seeing. The eyes are still on me, having totally deviated from their initial line of sight. WHAT IS EVEN LOOKING AT ME? My eyes were indeed getting accustomed to the dark and things were getting more visible. And I could see....a figure forming around the eyes. Then I heard....breathing.

&#x200B;

A sudden fear irked me and I did NOT turn on the light. I instead turned and bolted back upstairs into my parents' bedroom. I shout to them that there was someone downstairs. My father makes a call to the night watchman who runs to our house in about few minutes' time from the front gate. In the meantime my father gets Pranathi into the room. She trudged in, as if woken up from sleep. What even is this girl?? I did not speak a word. After he arrived, the watchman and my father together make a scan of the entire house. I didn't venture down at all. They found nothing. The watchman promised to make extra rounds around my house. My startled parents comfort me and lead me to the bathroom to help wash my face and get my nerves back. I finally go back to my room after not being able to fall asleep in my parents' bedroom. Pranathi also does.

&#x200B;

I think stress coupled with an unhealthy sleep cycle can make a person see things? The voices from Pranathi's room I still hear. Those are certainly there.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

May 5th

&#x200B;

Tonight I felt knocking on my door past bedtime. Little footsteps outside the door. I did not answer. The footsteps retreat. But only after a while. I was too sleepy to count the minutes. Apart from this no unusual activity this past week. Nanna's business hasn't been doing well. One of his truck drivers died after meeting with an accident on the highway. They might do a puja to remove "shanidosham" tomorrow it seems. Why are they so superstitious I wonder.

At office Prakash asked to discuss some work over biryani for lunch. I turned it down since I am always exhausted to discuss work. But thinking back maybe he was trying to ask me out? Not a bad face for an IT office. Wonder what HR would say...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

May 6th (continued)

&#x200B;

Since I've recounted all the relevant past dates, I should be able to record today's events. Something is really, really off. Amma and Nanna conducted a puja today to resolve bad luck or the evil eye my father fears has beset the family. Some "Satyanarayana vratham" it seems. And since they're extra religious, I mean superstitious, even a homam was performed. For the folks outside the culture a homam is a ceremony with a fire burning in the centre. Mantras are uttered while aiding the fire to burn.

&#x200B;

The priest/pujari was also a weird one. He was enthusiastically stating how this particular puja was a one size fits all treatment for ill things that befall in life. Also bestows long life and fortune. Even provides moksha. Haha didn't know Hinduism even had that. It really is the same everywhere isn't it. Anyway. You would think that the psychological placebo effect would do the trick of getting my parents' minds in order. But it was unusual that my parents' anxiety filled the day- rendering every facet of the puja to be in disarray. My mother took too long to wear the sari, the little decorations were not completely ready by the time the pujari arrived and even my father. the meticulous planner, forgot to buy ghee for the homam. Nothing about the ceremony went according to plan that day. More chaos that it was on Ugadi. This time I was the one getting all the paraphernalia- lime, coconut, flour, flowers- at the right time when everything seems to be in the wrong place when the puja started. Pranathi was calmly sitting in her father's lap. Coddled as ever. Guess sitting and getting pampered did not require any preparation.

&#x200B;

"There is a dosha or dishti that has permeated through your house, madam garu" he said to my mother.

&#x200B;

There came a point when the wood to keep the fire running in the homam was needed. As usual, my mother started bickering about where she last left it. I bring it to drop in the fire. My glance falls to Pranathi. As the fire starts to grow so does some smoke. She starts to cough. Then, a certain delight washes over me- seeing that. And mentioning this detail may be important now- at that moment, a  portion of my mind wished she choked.

&#x200B;

"PRITHIKAAAAA!!!!"

&#x200B;

My father screamed, with his hand motioning in my direction. I look to my rear and see that my sari caught fire. I was paralyzed to think what to do next. I just started unwrapping it there, but the fire would have caught onto my blouse the next second. Naana gets up and quickly pulls me into the garden. I start unwrapping the cloth round and round. He unloads the garden hose onto me with full force. And extinguishes what was rampantly about to devour me in a second's time. I suffered no burns and mysteriously only the little end portion of the sari was burnt off. It had seemed like a big flame only a moment ago. Felt like it would have completely engulfed me. My eyes- during this quick ordeal had fallen to the entrance of the house. And I saw those malicious eyes at me. It was the rakshasa on the dishti bomma. Its eyes were on me. I was sure of it. No denying that. That \*thing\* is onto me.

&#x200B;

My parents try to take me back inside but I resisted. I was too shaken, not by the fire but what I saw after that. I insisted I stay in the garden. Facing away from the house of course.

&#x200B;

"It's okay if your daughter is there, it's important you two finish it if you really want to resolve your problems. Just don't forget to make her eat the prasadham once done" the pujari said, convincing my parents to finish off what was started.

&#x200B;

I kept glancing into the house from time to time after that. Of course, not looking at the bomma. Surprisingly the puja went smoothly after that incident. No issue.

&#x200B;

"See the puja is already taking effect. Now we'll end the puja with story telling and having prasadham" the pujari remarked.

&#x200B;

Sigh. There is no dosha. There is no evil eye. Such a thing is psychologically explained where maliciousness from a person causes perception of harm in the other person, affirming the belief of the gaze being evil!

&#x200B;

But I couldn't help but notice one thing. What was a chaotic day went smooth after my incident. No, it was right after I went outside the house. As if my exit temporarily relieved the family. I was the trigger point. I was the dosha? Was I the...evil eye?

&#x200B;

My mother took me in finally, wrapped me in her old langa-oni. I can't sleep now. Writing this blog is the only thing keeping me going. I've lost lot of weight....

&#x200B;

Prakash texted about biryani again for tomorrow. I can't..I just can't.

&#x200B;

Okay, I'm not letting some silly superstitious magic get a hold of me. I'm getting rid of that bomma tomorrow.

&#x200B;

\*edit\* I'm typing again into this entry after getting woken up by a laugh. I'm not sure whether it was from a nightmare or from Pranathi's room. I'm not able to place the voice behind that laughter. If it's from a different room my parents would have heard it right? Maybe I'm just overthinking this. I shall try sleeping again now.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

May 7th

&#x200B;

I've got some alone time to think this through. I think it is just stress and nerves. And somehow it has all been affecting how I interpret the reality around me. I can't believe I've been so silly and eager to link some dysfunctional effects in my family onto some painted-on coconut shell! And we know what the source of these dysfunctional elements is.

&#x200B;

And yes I'm getting rid of that bomma. Not because I believe in something supernatural but because it takes away the positivity off my day when I look at it. And my previous obsession with it didn't help. Okay, it does give me the creeps at times. More than reason enough to get rid of it. I will be taking back control of my life now.

&#x200B;

Before leaving for work in the morning I saw Yadayya getting onto his lorry after meeting with Naana. I told him that he could take the bomma with him and put it to the back of his truck. He agreed considering he didn't have one of those hanging at the back of his lorry like most other lorries do. I don't believe in that evil eye stuff but I guessed right that he'd want something like that and even appreciate the gesture, which he did. I took the bomma off from where it usually hangs- nailed at the entrance, and gave it to Yadayya. I'm certainly not going to miss those devious looking eyes. Sorry Peddannanna.

&#x200B;

Office was usual. Something kept me going without needing coffee. Biryani with Prakash...wasn't exactly work related after all. Not like I expected that anyway.

&#x200B;

"You seem in a good mood today" he mentioned, somewhere in the conversation. "I take it you were....looking forward to this?" he asked.

&#x200B;

"Oh don't flatter yourself." I couldn't help the smirk. "I guess things are getting better at home." I remarked. He smiled back.

&#x200B;

"Haha that's nice to hear! But any major problem?" he inquired.

&#x200B;

"Oh no no. Everything's fine. It's just...my little sister can be a pain in the ass sometimes."

&#x200B;

"How old is she?" he asked.

&#x200B;

"5th standard."

&#x200B;

"Hey that's not so bad. But that's what family is kada. They annoy but you love them right?" he remarked. He really had a nice smile.

&#x200B;

"I'm not so sure." I replied, turning my eyes away. Why did I have to make things awkward? Why am I so stupid?

Prashanth broke the silence. "So....the Network Engineering team at office is your real family after all! I'll give a good appraisal to you!"

"Hahaha I don't think HR knowing about this would please them."

"Well how would HR know? And by the way, I might be promoted to Senior Manager and shifted to another department."

"Oh! That's...uh..nice to hear. Congratulations!"

"Not just yet! But soon." he quipped.

The rest of our date, if I could call it that- was the only other thing I could remember about my day. Cause..you know...if things go well, I can manage to get out of that house. Why am I smiling as I type this? Things are turning round after all. Makes for a nice ending to these blog entries no?

&#x200B;

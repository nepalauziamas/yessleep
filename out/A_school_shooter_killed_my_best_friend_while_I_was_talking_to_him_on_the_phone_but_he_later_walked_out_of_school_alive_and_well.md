Although I’d rather not start my story with this part, I have decided tell all of you about my past before this incident so that you will be able to trust me, however much that may be, and understand why the things that happened…happened. 

Trust cannot exist without trust.

What my English teacher, Mrs. Hedge, meant with this statement, is that for someone to trust you, you yourself must trust them.

You have to expose yourself  – to reveal something personal that shows the other party that you trust them enough to be privy of whatever it is that you tell them.

I intend to follow this advice until the day I die in her honor.

To say that I was a less than desirable child would be an understatement. In fact, I was the textbook definition of a bad kid. 

Shit grades, no friends, dark clothes, bad temper, smoking more weed than I breathed air, and viewing my life as something I would drift through like an invisible specter – there, but not really.

All through high school, I felt like a plastic bag floating through the depths of the ocean. 

Mrs. Hedge, my aforementioned English teacher, was the only one who kept me from hitting the bottom and laying there like a fossil.

Well, her and my best friend Tony. 

They were the closest thing to family that I have ever had. I met Tony back in third grade, a blessed time when no orders of social construct existed, and everyone just played with each other equally. As time went by, and I started to transmutate into the degenerate that was high school me, Tony never left my side. He stuck by me no matter what, always willing to listen to whatever I had to say, no matter how much weed my words were soaked in. His smile never left his face, and everything would always seem a little less bad whenever we talked. Tony was the brother I never had, the person who I could tell anything and everything to without the fear of being judged. 

As time passed, our conversations became more of a one-sided interrogation. I would always end the topic of discussion – whatever it might be – by asking him why the hell he still stayed by my side. His grades, his status, his opportunities, and so on were all top notch after all. He had nothing to gain by being with me, but he would always shake his head and smile, saying that he just didn’t care and loved spending time with me.

Mrs. Hedge was my sophomore English teacher, and its only because of her that English was the only subject I didn’t failed. She was sensitive to my needs, and seemed to have an understanding of me that even I didn’t have. Her class was always open to me, and she would always excuse me from studying as long as I would read a book that she would give me. 

I stayed out of trouble for the most part, and because of Tony and Mrs. Hedge, I never truly did hit rock bottom, although I admit I did come pretty damn close.

But alas, what slowly comes up, must inevitably come crashing down.

Everyone in school hated me, even though I didn’t do jack shit to them, unlike some of the other assholes that roamed those damn halls.

My sophomore year ended abruptly with a sour note on January, right at the start of the second semester, when my fist connected with the jaw of a kid who’d insulted Tony and Mrs. Hedge. I was the type of person that you could poke and prod with whatever you wanted, be it words or a stick, but I’d never fight back.

That time was different.

That time, it wasn’t me they had insulted.

They had insulted people who didn’t deserve a single syllable of what had been said about them.

I could take whatever they could throw at me, because in my mind, I deserved it.

But I didn’t that day, because those who had been insulted didn’t deserve it.

Needless to say, Junior year started without me, despite the efforts of Tony and Mrs. Hedge.

Their support might have been infinite, but they were no match for the bastards that ran that place.

It wasn’t so bad, if I’m being honest. 

Being stuck home all day, that is.

More time for my weed. 

More time for my shows. 

More time for my thoughts.

Not to mention more time for jobs (although I never really did dedicate myself to that one quite like I did to the others). 

See? Honesty.

Another thing that I learned during this time while alone is that the old saying my grandfather would always tell me really was true.

The devil always comes at night.

I can tell you from first-hand experience that he stands at the foot of your bed, and tells you all that you don’t want to hear.

But you do.

Because it’s true.

It’s because it is true that it is so horrible.

Every night he would come and say them to me.

My faults.

The words would gush out of his obscured mouth and did so till the first rays of light pierced through my dirty curtains.

Only then would he leave...but he would be there the next night.

He was a distant memory when the sun sat in the sky, but an all too real reminder of what I was when it would hide.

That was me.

I’m not ashamed to admit it.

Because…it’s the truth, as *he* would always say.

And I agree with that.

But after a certain day…his stories changed.

He no longer chastises me.

I am no longer the object of his ridicule.

Instead, every night, while I sink through the boundary that separates reality from dreams, he takes that brief moment, when I take my last conscious breath, to remind me why the inside of my skull roil, boil, and churn with nightmares while I sleep.

He whispers it right before I become fully submerged in the more viscous world of dreams, and as the air of consciousness escapes from my mouth and floats up to the surface where it belongs, his words are all that stay, weighing me down and ensuring that I sink down to where no light can reach.

I no longer have peace.

All because of that day.

…

I cannot say with any degree of certainty which day it was. They all blended together back then, like plaques of clear glass laid on top of one-another.

That was my life, and to some extent, continues to be my life.

That bubble I used to live in burst one day.

Popped by the sound of my cellphone ringing, my monotonous routine forever shattered by the voice that spoke to me on that day while I lay barely lucid on my red grimy couch, a half-eaten pizza near me and my bong resting on my chest.

“H…hello?” I barely managed.

Nothing.

I was about to put my phone down.

I really was.

But then words escaped the little object in my hand before I had a chance to do so.

“B-B-Ben?” The voice on the other end stuttered, even less decipherable than my mumbles. It sounded like a set of teeth were clattering madly, chewing the words of the person on the other end and making sure that they came out as unintelligible and garbled vomit.

“T-Tony?”

I stood up, the bong sliding off and tumbling to the moldy floor.

I could hear his heavy breathing on the other side, and I felt myself go sober in a heartbeat.

I heard everything.

I swear.

I heard his voice refracting off of the walls of wherever he was, and bouncing back into the receiver. My hearing was so focused that I could actually hear the tiny microphone of my phone working, struggling to decipher the electrical signals flowing through it like a mule barely able to drag along a heavy cart.

“Tony, where are you?”

My heart pounded as if I was having a bad high.

“Oh…god,” he said, “they’re not coming…I call and call but they just tell me to stop calling. They just threaten me with arrest if I and everyone else don’t stop prank calling them!”

“Who?”

“The p-police damn it!”

“What?”

“Damn it Ben…”

Tony was almost in hysterics.

“Fuck…It happened so quick. An officer had come to school to warn us about the god damn prank calls, and right in the middle of the speech, from behind the curtain of the auditorium, there was a flash of light and the bastard-the ba-the bastard’s face splattered on the ground like a fucking mop”

By now, it sounded like he was trying to talk while restraining the uncontrollable heaves of his throat.

“Th-t-then,” he continued, “someone stepped onto the fucking stage f-from behind the c-c-curtains and….and….”

I said nothing.

My mind was skimming over what I had heard so far, trying desperately to authenticate it, making sure that I wasn’t mishearing every single word.

When it told me that I was really hearing what I was hearing, my breathing quickened, and then stiffened, and then softened, so that if felt like my throat was a soft sponge, expanding and putting pressure on the inside of my neck with every breath.

“Where are you?” I asked.

A painful moment of silence ensued.

“The…the bathroom….i-in a stall” was the reply.

My heart dropped.

“Listen,” I said, suddenly very focused and trying to whisper, “you’re not safe there! Get in the ceiling. It shouldn’t be too hard. Just move one of those board, get in there, and stay put until help arrives. I’m coming there myself.”

He was going to reply.

I knew he would.

He would tell me to not come, but he never did.

Instead, I only heard the sound of the stall door opening, and before I knew it, I was out of my house with the vague memory of a very loud sound bursting forth from the tiny speaker of my tiny phone.

As I write this, I can still remember how numb my mind felt, how much my vision tunneled. My legs moved much the same as my fingers do now, typing this out – furiously and with unimaginable care. My first thought after my mind went blank only came after I found myself staring at my old school.

All was silent. 

Suddenly, I started to slowly drip back into reality. My legs started to burn, my side felt like it had been stabbed, my lungs felt like soaked rags, my body was covered in sweat, and I felt that my heart was about burst forth from my chest.

I almost lost my balance, a gentle breeze nearly knocking me off of my feet, and I was amazed with myself that I managed to retain my balance, despite an abysmal blackness seeping in from the edges of my vision.

And yet, despite this, I still ran. 

I ran towards the front door (which was quite a stupid move on my part…but alas, hindsight only hits after the fact).

My entire upper-body shook and swayed from side to side, as though it were a spinning top balancing itself on my moving legs.

I damn near collided with that entrance like a bull, narrowly avoiding any broken bones.

I pushed, and I pushed, the soles of my bare feet grating against the rough concrete below. The cold damn near burned my exposed skin off, as though the wisps of frigid air were tails of fire lashing at me like whips.

I can’t tell you how desperate I was.

The cold made my teeth want to chatter so hard that they would surely break, but I managed to keep my mouth shut.

The cold cement made me feel like I’d put both my feet in a bucket of nails, and the cold handle of the entrance door felt like it was slowly fusing to my hands.

Even so, I desperately tried to push, unaware of the tears that were slowly dripping from my eyes.

I felt my body approaching its limit. 

I knew the next push would be my last.

I steadied myself, and I threw my entire torso forward while simultaneously pushing with my legs.

Time seemed to slow down.

I felt my right shoulder approaching the surface of the green door, and just before I collided with it, a shrill sound pierced my ear like a bullet while I barreled forward like a wrecking ball.

The last bell ring of the day.

My shoulder collided with the door, but instead of instantly breaking, I felt myself falling forward, and before I knew it, I found myself on the marble floor of the school entrance, right over the logo of my school – cold, beaten, and feeling as though rebar had been shoved thorough the very bones that made up my skeleton.

I screamed and got up onto my feet, damn near having my legs fail on me.

I expected many things at that moment as my gaze focused and widened.

The hallway to be dark from the lack of light.

Not fully lit.

The air to reek of blood.

Not pine essential oil.

I expected the floor to be littered with everyone’s bodies – all killed mid-crawl while desperately trying to escape.

Not for them all to be standing before me, holding their backpacks with school supplies, and ready to leave for the day.

I stood transfixed for a moment, as if petrified by their gazes.

My eyes spun wildly in my sockets, jittering madly as they scanned the vicinity.

Everything was perfect.

From the lights.

To the décor.

To my peers.

Nervously, some started to make their way past me to go outside, and once the others saw that I didn’t lunge for the brave ones, they too began to pass me.

Some even had the audacity to bump my shoulder, while the less ballsy ones giggled at my expense.

I stood there, the sea of people flowing past me as though I were leper.

I slowly turned, and stared at them as they left, their backs seemingly mocking me as they disappeared through the door I’d worked so hard to open.

The blood vessels in my eyes felt like barbed wire.

The bones in my hand felt like icicles.

And the bottoms of my feet felt as though they were stripped of their skin.

A hand placed itself on my bruised shoulder, and I immediately turned, ignoring the pain of my feet ripping from the ground, the dried blood having kept them still like superglue.

“Dude…” Tony said, “what happened?”

The look of concern he had made me break down.

I hugged him with all my might as the tears I’d been holding back started to gush out.

No one paid us any mind.

I feel no shame when remembering that moment.

That is, I don’t feel ashamed about being a teenager and hugging by best friend so hard that I must’ve cracked some of his ribs.

The only shame I feel is not punching the bastard that passed us at that moment.

The devil particularly likes to remind me of that one any chance he gets.

But his words have little effect on me.

Please don’t get me wrong.

I still wish I could have done things differently.

But honestly…how could I have known that the kid – one of hundreds – who passed me and Tony that day had a spent assault rifle in his percussion suitcase?

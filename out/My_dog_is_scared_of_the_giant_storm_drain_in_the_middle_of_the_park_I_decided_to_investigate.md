There's this small park in my neighborhood that people love to use to walk their dogs in the morning. It's located on a lower level than the street, so it's prone to floods during rainstorms. That's why they installed a large storm drain right in the middle of the park.

When my girlfriend moved in with me, she brought her German Shepard, Jax. I have to say I've never been much of a dog person, but Jax actually kind of grew on me. Eventually we became friendly enough with each other that I started taking him on walks in the morning. That's how I found the storm drain.

It was a chilly winter morning, and I had been walking Jax for about 3 weeks at that point. Halfway through our walk in the park, Jax looked like he had seen a ghost. His ears parked up, his hair raised, and he started pulling on his leash. He pulled so hard his leash snapped and he ran straight to the storm drain and starting barking like crazy. There were a few other people in the park, and the whole situation was extremely embarrassing. I could barely get him out of the park.

2 days later and armed with a much stronger leash, I brought Jax back to the park. Once again, he started freaking out about the storm drain. He couldn't break off his leash this time, so I just resisted his pull, and we made it through our walk without another incident. 

It went on like this for 2 months. That's when I decided to do some investigation of my own. I decided to wait until it got dark and went out to the park, making sure nobody else was around. I went to the storm drain and bent down to my knees, tilted my head and brought it down to listen.

I couldn't see anything, but the sound I heard were straight out of a nightmare. I heard loud, metallic clanging and this crazy moaning noise. All mixed in with the sound of flowing water and what I thought might have been a high-pitched squealing noise, although it may have been the pipes. I ran out of the park faster than I ever had in my life.

My girlfriend told me I was overreacting. That it was probably just city workers doing maintenance. But I just couldn't agree with her. She didn't hear all of those spine-chilling noises. We decided to just agree to disagree, but I told her I would be changing my walk route and start taking Jax to the dog park which was a half mile further away.

Like always, time moved on. 4 months went by without any incidents. And then the posters started showing up. I live in an idyllic neighborhood; very low crime levels and bad things rarely happen. That's why it was so easy to notice that 9 dogs went missing within 4 blocks of my house. Missing dog posters were plastered everywhere; all under the same circumstance: The dog always disappeared in the middle of the night and was always last seen in the general vicinity of the park. 

So many dogs went missing that the police did set up a minor investigation. You could tell it wasn't a huge priority for them. Dogs run away all the time, but 9 within a small radius of the park? They should have paid more attention. They should have investigated the park when I told them about the noises they heard. But they thought I was a lunatic.

Another 5 months go by without anything interesting happening. Around that time, my girlfriend broke up with me. We had a huge fight. She packed a small bag and ran off in the middle of the night, even leaving Jax behind. I was closer to him at that point than she was anyway, so I guess she thought he would be better off with me. She was wrong. 

I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of shattering glass. I dash into the kitchen and to my horror I see my kitchen's sliding glass window has completely shattered, and I see Jax's black-tipped tail slipping over the edge of my fence. I slip on a pair of sweatpants and grab my cars keys, and I can see Jax bounding down the sidewalk at the speed of light, clearly headed towards the park. I probably hit a mailbox or two in the heat of the moment as I chased after him, eventually making it to the park. I run through the small clearing of trees, barely able to see the small section of pavement in the middle of the grass where the storm drain was installed. I make it there, but in the moonlight, this is what I saw:

The large grate was open, and I saw my dogs tail slipping down into the darkness, and a large hand came out of the darkness, grabbed the grate, and slipped it closed.

I ran up the grate, grabbing it with my fingers and started shaking it violently, trying to pull it open, but it was apparently locked somehow. "Let me in there, you MOTHERFUCKER!" I shouted, "I'm getting the fucking cops if you don't open this grate right now!" It was futile. My dog was gone. I couldn't get into the drain. Some sick bastard had taken my dog, and probably all the other dogs in this neighborhood.

I decided to get down and listen for any noises, only to instantly regret it. I heard what must have been dozens of dogs violently screaming and yelping. I vomited everywhere and started crying. I grabbed my phone and tried to call the cops. My hands were shaking so hard I couldn't even dial the first digit of 911. I realized the only way out of this situation was if I calmed myself down and stopped shaking so I could actually fix whatever was going on. And at this point I decided, fuck the cops, they never believed me about this damn storm drain anyway, I'm fixing this myself.

It took about 10 minutes, but I calmed down. Jax was depending on me to save him, and that fact kept me moving forward. I looked at the grate and saw the locking mechanism. It was 3 simple pins under the grate. So, I drove to the hardware store (which was, thank God, open 24 hours a day) and bought a large bolt cutter, a handheld electronic wood saw, and a few other random tools that I thought might help me break into the grate. I also bought a head lamp so I could see inside of the sewer grate.

I stopped by my house on the way home and grabbed my gun. 

I got back to the part. By this time, it was raining pretty hard. Luckily, I was able to break the pin with only the bolt cutter that I bought. I didn't hear anymore dogs screaming. Two scenarios ran through my head: the person doing this was done for the night, or he had killed them all. A small ladder led down into the darkness. I crawled down into a small, sewer-like area that had a small current of running water going through it. It was a pretty small, cramped space. One wall had a green metal door that was slightly propped open.

It was apparently scenario number one. 4 dogs came barging through the green door, and they all looked rabid. They were missing fur, covered in huge red rashes and scabs, and foaming at the mouth. They lunged forward, and I went into fighting mode. Not wanting to waste the ammo in my gun, I fought back with the hand saw and the bolt cutter. Their long, untrimmed claws dug into my skin as they snapped at my face with rotten teeth. A few slashes from the saw killed them. It made me sick to have to kill a dog, but I was in full self-defense mode now. Not knowing what I would see, I went through the green door.

What I saw could best be described as a workshop. Long wooden tables lined the walls of a large hallway, way bigger than you would expect. I don't know what an area like this would have been doing under a storm drain. There were many large machines in between these tables.

The tables were covered with pieces of dogs.

Every shape, every size, all fresh. Blood was dripping like a faucet from the edges of every table. Heads, legs, tails, and skeletons were scattered everywhere. That's when I noticed that many of the machines had blades, spikes, ropes, and all other kinds of weird attachments. This was a torture chamber.

Any sane person would have been out of there in a flash, but I needed to find Jax. He had only been taken an hour ago, surely he must still be alive, right? I noticed another green door at the end of this huge chamber. This place couldn't go on for long. Whoever did this must be through that door. 

I opened the second green door and walked in. To my relief, there were no dead dogs in this section. But what I saw was even stranger. Two large dog bowls were set in the corner of the room. One was full of fresh dog food, one had fresh water. In the other corner of the room, there was a large dog bed with a few blankets in it. Scattered throughout the room was a variety of dog toys, including a tattered rope and some old bones. Weirdest of all, one corner of the room was full of human excrements. 

There was no other door in this room. Whatever this place was, I had reached the end of it. I hadn't found Jax. There was nobody here. Everything was silent.

A loud howl broke the silence. I turned and grabbed my gun. The howl was followed by a large crash, and I went backout the green door, ready for a fight. 

I will never be able to erase what I saw from my mind.

The largest man I had ever seen, on all fours, crouched at the end of the torture chamber. The only way I can describe the man's appearance is that he was wearing Jax. Jax's brown, perky ears were sewn to the side of his head. His mangled snout was somehow attached to the sick fucker's face, and my poor dog's fur was completely stretched around the man's body. To top it off, Jax's tail was attached at the end.

The man started barking. This demented, psychopathic man started barking at me. And then he started running. It looked almost superhuman, the way he was able to run so fast while on all fours. I grabbed my gun and pointed it straight at his head and pulled the trigger. But the gun jammed. I couldn't fire it. 

He lunged at me, grabbing my face with extremely long, twisted fingernails that had bits of Jax's flesh sewn on at the base. He pushed me down and I fought back. I fought back so hard, tearing pieces of my dead dog's skin off of him, but he was stronger than me. He was easily 6'8 and made out of pure muscle. He started biting off my face and tearing the skin off my chest. He was growling, and an inhuman amount of saliva was pouring out of his mouth onto me.

Through the chaos I screamed, "What do you want from me? Why the fuck are you doing this? Why did you do this to all these dogs?" He stopped growling and barking. In a deep human voice, he replied: 

"I am the Dog Man. You are in my territory."

I screamed and almost blacked out. He continued to tear me apart. I could see bits of my flesh and blood being flung everywhere. No matter how hard you try, it will be impossible for you to imagine the pain I went through. I had almost lost consciousness when I saw a long metal rod laying across a nearby table, with a spiked ball on the end. It was a struggle, but I slowly fought him back and the fight slowly crawled towards that table. In one last feet of strength, I grabbed the weapon and pushed back on his chest, quickly getting to my feet. I continued to beat him and push him back with the rod.

During this struggle, he bit my left arm. A huge chunk of my skin was torn off, causing blood to spray everywhere. I couldn't move my arm. He had torn a tendon or a nerve or something, but I lost the arm. I was fighting back, holding the spiked rod, continuing to push him towards a large torture machine, one that had spiked blades lining the door. I pushed him inside, and he began to howl.

I slammed the door shut and noticed a large red on/off switch on the side of the machine, which was similar to the shape of a refrigerator. I flipped the switch on and heard the blades start whirring. The Dog Man screamed, not like a dog, but like a human this time. It was the last sound he ever made.

I crawled my way to the ladder that brought me down into this nightmare. I couldn't climb up the ladder. My left arm was completely useless. I laid down and passed out.

When I woke up, I saw blue and red lights coming through the grate. The cops were here. They took me out, and I blacked out again, this time waking up in the hospital. I'm writing this from my hospital bed. They said I had some kind of infection, but it was something unlike the doctors had ever seen. They say I'm probably going to die within the next 24 hours, because almost every limb in my body has been severely infected. The doctors have noticed another strange effect. My muscle mass is rapidly increasing, and my canine teeth have nearly doubled in length. I've somehow gained an inch in height.

I've been feeling these weird urges. It's like my brain is telling me there is something I have to do before I die. Multiple people visit me throughout the day, including a few nurses, my ex-girlfriend, and my parents. Something about them feels unfamiliar though. They feel, how do I word this, different from me. They eat regular food instead of raw meat. They're all so clean and professional. It bothers me for some reason. I have this intense desire to make them feel the way I feel. I think I have a solution for this though.

 A single little nibble, one little bite of their flesh, would show them the real way. It would show them the way of The Dog.

Hey readers it's me again! It's 3:23pm, but you would never guess that because now over twenty-four hours later the sun is nowhere to be found I don't think I'm "home" anymore, I haven't felt the need to eat or drink and sleeping just makes the time go by faster.This place seems to be a shitty copy of our plane of existence. The reason I say this is because some of the landmarks I've never seen before. Some are new and some I've just never seen before, it's like when you dream about your hometown but things are.. different. Im somewhere safe and my phone is currently at 78% I need to stop checking Reddit and give my phone a break but it was so nice to hear from some of you. I heard that Trader Joe's in California is safe, glad to hear. And there was talks of wraiths or an evil entity which to be fair I wouldn't doubt at this point. I ended up staying awake most of the night due to the influx of foot traffic outside the house.There is definitely something wrong, I tried to keep myself busy by writing notes throughout the night heres what happened.

The time is about 1:00am, I wasn't able to get myself asleep thanks to the block party containing what sounded like hundreds of sobbing entities. I tried peeking out from one of the living room windows but could only make out the sea of silhouettes parading the street. Before I was noticed I went back to the couch and tried to make sense of this whole situation. After I finished writing my last entry I began putting all of my heavy furniture against the windows and entries, I grabbed my grandfathers old hunting rifle out of the storage closet and curled up on the couch. I've pretty much been here and to the window since then. I still havent checked the basement, I was told I shouldn't check and that I should just run to the car and leave but honestly, that might be the best plan right now. it seems that these things are more active at the later hours which makes no sense to me because there's no fucking sun. Sorry, this whole thing has me a bit on edge.

2:45am, and I'm starting to lose my mind. I can't taking the crying anymore. I can't tell if it's getting quieter or I'm just getting used to it but it still is pushing every button it can. I think they are starting to figure out where I am. Every few minutes I thought could hear tapping on the front door, faint but definitely somebody tapping on the door. I could be going crazy but who would be tapping on the door? The door is being tapped on. The door.

4:51am, I'm sorry for  that last note I had written, it ended during the start of a panic attack. I ended up finding a few joints to calm myself down and got a few hours of sleep. The crying is almost gone I think I can hear a handful outside but no one close. Thankfully there's no sign of "the tapping on the door" if this keeps up I might be able to get the hell out of here and hope to god whatever this is stays here. The car will need gas before I go anywhere, I have an extremely bad habit of leaving my gas tank super empty and the current gas prices aren't helping. We do keep a rather large Jerry can in the basement but that would require well, going into the basement.

5:30am, well I'm back upstairs and I need to make this short. I should have listened to whoever said not to go into the basement and just took off running. After gaining the courage to go down to the dark dwelling, I unlocked the basement door and began to descend the stairs. The basement looked as if a wild animal was trapped down there for hours. I quickly grabbed the Jerry can stowed away in the corner and turned around. Standing at the bottom of the stairs was a small child playing with something on the stairs, as I got closer I saw what it was playing with. The child was playing with a blood soaked dog collar as if it was some sort of toddlers play toy. He looked up at me and smiled, the same substance leaking from his eyes as the woman from the day before. "Fuck that!" I exclaimed as I jumped over the first few steps and ran for the door. Before slamming the door the last thing I saw was the child sitting in the same spot with that same damn smile.

6:30am, I made it 20min outside of town. There's about 40km left in the tank, it's quiet out here and not a sign of any life. I'm just glad I got out of there. As I was running to the car I couldn't help but notice something scratched into the front door. I stopped to quickly check, "WE KNOW YOURE IN THERE" was crudely engraved into the center of my front door. Without anymore hesitation I took off to fill that tank and get the hell out of there. There's another small down about 15km from here so I think I'm going to take my chances there.

8:56am, I've found somewhere comfortable a bit further up in the mountains about 10 minutes out of town. A small cabin would now be my place to call home, thankfully being a wealthy tourist town the cabin came equipped with solar panels and a small battery that should keep my phone charged. I still don't understand why Reddit of all things are working my phone shows full bars but still no phone calls or even the internet browser will work. The only thing my phone is allowing me to do is make Reddit posts and read/make comments. I'm going to get my phone on a charger and see if I can find out anything new.

1:00pm I must have fallen asleep after boarding the windows and securing the entrances, While my phone was charging and having no light source I managed to find an emergency sledding kit that included a small extendable shovel, a flashlight, a small first aid kit and a gps. No matter what I did I couldn't stop thinking about the front door. If they knew I was in the house what was stopping them from entering and why was the child able to enter the house? The collar.. no I need to calm down and think about how I'm going to survive this and get back to my everyday normal life. There's still no sun but now that we have a flashlight i won't have to rely on my phone for light anymore. Maybe because I'm secluded out of town we will have a quiet night to figure some things out.

It's now 4pm and I'm preparing to post this, I think I'm going to hide out tonight and try to regain my strength. I'm going to need to head into town tomorrow to find some supplies. If anyone can find out anything please for the love of God let me know. I'm currently at 50.?98*° N, 1∆8.19$7° W. What are these things and why are the oldies sad and the young ones happy? I feel like I might be trapped in some sort of purgatory. There's definitely something wrong.

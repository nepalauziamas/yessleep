If you ever get a chance to visit the beautiful city of San Francisco, everyone always recommends taking a tour on one of their historic cable cars. 

There are currently three lines running, from 7am to 10pm every day in the bustling city, and I enjoy seeing the sights they offer quite regularly. 

There is one, however, that I will warn you about. 

I have never been one to believe in ghosts, but one night after a few drinks I was walking toward my apartment when I saw a cable car in the middle of the road, completely empty. 

It was late, probably almost 2am and there wasn’t anyone else on the street except for me, so at first I thought I was seeing things. I knew that the normal thing these cars would do is park at their end stations for the night to get out of the way of traffic, so seeing it here with no driver and no passengers was very bizarre. 

I got a little closer and realized that the car was quite old, resembling one yoh might see back in the 50s or 60s with red paint that was almost rusted off and wheels that looked corroded. Maybe one of the stations was moving an older model to a museum somewhere nearby? 

I decided to get a better look and climbed aboard the left side, noticing that even though the trolley was quite old I didn’t see much dust on the seats. Had it been used recently? 

“Where to sir?” a voice asked at the front of the car, startling me. 

A man dressed in the usual uniform for an operator and he tipped his hat at me before asking me again where I was headed. 

“Oh I’m very sorry, I don’t need a ride. I was just interested in this trolley. Don’t normally see them out this late,” I explained as I was about to get off. 

“That’s because the normal cabs don’t run this late, son,” he said. 

I paused, my foot almost touching the ground and turned toward him, a bit intrigued. “What does that mean?” 

“Just that this route will take you places you’ve never been before,” the driver told me. 

“Like where?” 

“Anywhere.” 

I pulled my foot back in and checked the time. I didn’t have work in the morning so I reached for my wallet and said, “How much for a round trip?”

“Sorry. This route only goes one way,” the driver told me. 

“Fine fine, you’ve got my attention, as long as I get dropped off near my apartment I don’t care,” I said offering him a credit card. 

“Son, that pay won’t do you good for this ride. Needs to be something a bit more valuable,” he replied. 

“Oh right. You probably don’t have a card reader on this old thing,” I mumbled and checked my pockets. “Well sorry, I don’t have any cash, maybe next time,” I suggested. 

I was about to climb off again when the driver touched my wrist and his cold fingers rubbed against my wedding band. 

“This ought to do just fine,” he purred. 

His hand was as cold as ice but his grip was a bit firm and I snagged myself away, bumping against part of the inner cab before commenting, “What? No, sorry. I couldn’t do that. My wife… my… late wife gave that to me on our tenth anniversary.” 

“So then nothing else could match it in value,” the driver said as he took off his cap and held it out. 

“Something that important should be just what you need to get to where you need to go,” he told me cryptically. 

Where I needed to go…?

“You’re not making sense, old man. And I’m not giving you this ring,” I told him. 

“Suit yourself. But you must have boarded this trolley for a reason. Everyone always does,” the driver commented. 

What did he mean by that? Had I been the only one to see the trolley?

“And now I’m leaving,” I said, getting up. He held his hand in my way, a dark grin forming on his face. 

“If you do, I guarantee that you’ll never get this chance again. Is that the risk you’re willing to take?” he whispered. 

There was mischief in his eyes, but I could tell from just the snippets of conversation we had that there was something extraordinary going on. 
Not to mention in the few minutes that I had been on the trolley, everything around me had seemed to go to a complete stop. The world was silent, waiting for me to answer his question. 

“Just where exactly are you offering to take me?” I asked. 

“Where would you like to go?” he asked. 

The question was open ended, I realized that he didn’t necessarily mean this city anymore. 

Anywhere. Anytime. Anyplace. The sudden realization of the offer was a bit thrilling. 

“Take me to Amanda,” I decided immediately as I offered the wedding band to his open palm. 

“And we have a destination,” he said as he went back to the controls of the cab and started up the engine. 

I slowly sat down on the empty row, watching as the ancient trolley groaned to life and began to ease its way down the road. 

At first, I didn’t really see anything of interest and I was rethinking this entire bizarre encounter. 

Then as I watched the road ahead, I couldn’t help but to notice that we were passing by the same buildings again. Except that they seemed a little farther from the street. 

I leaned forward, rubbing my eyes and trying to adjust and make sure I was seeing things correctly. 

The vibrant and colorful city was seemingly now drained of color. Drab and gray. And farther and farther away then it had been a moment ago. 

Still, the trolley went forward. The driver adjusted his speed and the city began to speed by now. Buildings blurred past until there were no distinct shapes. Light was gone and I found it difficult to even keep looking. 

Then I saw this strange open hole in front of us. 
It was black and stretching across the entire horizon. 

Before I could react, our cable car plunged into the hole. 

The darkness was all over me. I couldn’t even see my own hands in front of my face as we kept going and I asked the driver, “How much further??” 

I wasn’t sure I could keep up at this rate, my body feeling heavy and panic setting in. 

The darkness was soul crushing. The inescapable inevitability of death. 

Then he pulled back on the controls and the trolley stopped. There was nothing around us. 

Not even a speck of light. 

I couldn’t even see a horizon, or a sky. Or anything that remotely reminded me of home. 

“Where are we?” I whispered. 

“The is is your stop, Sean,” the driver told me. 

For the first time since we started I looked at his face. 

Except he didn’t have one. There was nothing there except a canvas waiting to be painted on. 

“I… I can’t get off here. I don’t understand. I wanted… my wife. Is she not in Heaven?” I asked, trying to hold back tears. 

“What is Heaven? What is Hell? What are the dreams that man makes except trifles to a god?” the driver asked. His voice was in my head. It sounded like my voice. It sounded like I was mocking myself for ever thinking that I would see my love again. 

“This is… the end of the road,” the voice told me. 

“I want to go back,” I told the driver. 

It didn’t respond, perhaps amused by my shallow pleas. 

“I need to go back. Please,” I told it. 

“Why? Why go back when it will always lead you here?”

I was trying my best to hold back more tears. 

“I don’t know. I don’t think she would want me here… not yet. Not until I find a reason to live again,” I told the voice. 

The Void was echoing my words but they felt so hollow and so pointless. 

“There is nothing to go back to,” the voice told me. It wasn’t just empty rhetoric. It spoke with authority. 

I could hear… what sounded like singing. Right off the edge of the trolley. It reminded me of her. The way she would wake up in the morning and shower and hum to herself. 

Even in the darkness I could see her silhouette, she was washing her scalp. Even during the chemo, her smile did not fade. 

“I still have her,” I told the driver. 

The faceless creature didn’t make a response so I took the chance to explain this new found reason for life. 

“She never left me. You’re wrong. She isn’t here. She is here with me. Every step of my path is one we are taking together. And that’s where I need to go.” 

For a long silent moment, the creature said nothing. Processing my words. 

Then it pulled on the lever and the trolley began to move again. 

I settled down in my seat and watched as everything happened in reverse. First the void slipped away then the blurring buildings. Then the colors returned and then the streets narrowed again. 

I was back where I started. 

I quickly got up and prepared to climb off the trolley, a cold sweat covering my body. 

The creature offered me the wedding band back that I had held onto for so long. 

“You can keep it. I have everything I need,” I told it as I stepped off the trolley. 

I took a few tentative steps down the street, almost feeling like I had sea legs and then felt this strange tingle run up and down my spine. 

Turning back, I saw the trolley was gone from the street. 

Maybe it had never been there to begin with. 

Or maybe it had finished its route for the night.

I was in 5th grade when we had a new kid in our class. Since I use my real name on this app, we’ll call her— Sarah. Sarah had brownish thin hair and was very pale. She was about my height. She had a very weird smile but it was cheeky. She seemed sweet.. kinda. 

Usually when there were new kids at my school, everybody wanted to be friends with them. But not Sarah— nobody wanted to be friends with her, like they knew something was off about her. 

Me and my friend— we will call her Nancy. We played at this tree behind the playground during recess. The second we got out of school for recess we ran to the tree as we always did. When we got there we saw her. Sarah. She was just sitting next to it with her journal. We decided to leave her alone.

We just started playing at the other tree— closer to the school. 

One day, the more known girls were surrounding the tree I used to play at. Me and my friend got a closer look. “What is wrong with you freak?” The popular girl screamed as she dropped the journal that belonged to Sarah.

When the teacher blew the whistle to let us know recess was over, me and my friend Nancy checked out what was in Sarah’s journal. 

We were shocked when we saw what we saw.

Almost everybody in my class was drawn in her journal, except they had looks in their face and were highly injured. It looked like she planned everybody’s death. Except mine. 

I never found out why I wasn’t in there.

Later that day after school, I went to Nancy’s house. Luckily she lived down the street. 
I had left her house that afternoon as my older sister had came to get me. 

As I was walking back to my house, I saw a house. It was blue and a one story house. Except it had caution tape all over and police and the ambulance were there. “What do you think happened?” I asked my sister, “Sounds like something we shouldn’t get involved with.” She answered. 

The next day at school, Nancy came up to me. She had a look on her face that showed that she did not have good news.

“Did you see that house the other day that had police surrounding it?” She questioned. 
“Yeah?” I answered. “Turns out it was Sarah’s house.” She said as I remember my heart dropped. “They found a girl’s hand in her closet.” Nancy said as her breath had shaken. “It was the girl who touched her journal.” Nancy gulped. 

The police had found the girl’s hand attached to the back of Sarah’s closet door, like some decoration. They never found any parents or any legal guardian in her house or Sarah. They never found the girl either.

I was in my second year at middle school as we had a new kid in my class. She had thin red hair and was very pale. She looked awfully familiar. 

Remember the popular friend group of girls I told you about earlier? I ended up going to middle school with them. It was the popular girl who was never found’s best friend’s birthday. It was the end of the day as everyone was putting their stuff back in their backpacks. Suddenly I heard a scream, it caught everyone’s attention. 

“What the f***?!“ I heard as I saw a big crowd surrounding the girl’s best friend’s locker. I got a closer look as it was an opened gift. It was the girl from before’s hand. I knew it was, so did everyone else. Same pink nail polish, same skinny hand. I heard a locker slam as it was the new girl’s locker. 

She walked away slowly, keeping eye contact with me as she smiled. Cheeky smile. 

It was Sarah.

The school had everyone get to their buses to get home to their families. 

The police had obviously got involved. But, they never found who had put that gift in the girl’s best friend’s locker. They never found Sarah after that day either. 

I still have so many questions. How did Sarah get that hand in her reach? I thought it was with the police? Why now? Where’d Sarah even go? Will she return? What happened to the popular girl?

"Can you tell me a little bit more about the property?"

*"It was built in the late 1870's, but most of the original structure and exterior has been replaced and updated throughout the years"*.

"Oh yes, quite old then. There must be a bit of history within the house. A few stories surrounding it?"

*"I've heard a number of local legends that involve the house. I once heard it was used as a distillery during the prohibition era. I've heard that JFK once took a photo in front of the place.*

*Oh, and someone once claimed that, for a whole summer, a cult squatted inside the house while it was vacant.  They claimed that the members left behind strange markings and small burn marks along the walls"*.

"Well, that certainly is a rich history. I see here that you have purchased our Golden Paranormal Insurance Policy, with protection against hauntings, poltergeists, possessions and death from supernatural occurrences?".

"*That's correct*".

"I can certainly see why you have chosen our top insurance package. Due to the age and history of the house, you definitely want the best cover against any sort of paranormal activity. Especially if some sort of cult has been operating within your home".

*"That won't affect my claim, will it? Just cause I saw that if the ghost was summoned, then I won't be covered?*".

"No, no, you will still be covered. That clause only applies if you summoned the entity yourself".

"*Oh good. That's a relief".*

"But anyway, I really must ask you about your claim. I see that you have applied for $2780 in property damage and another $10,450 compensation for the emotional distress the haunting has caused you and your family. Does that all sound familiar"?

"*Yes, that's right".*

"Oh good. Well, as I'm sure you understand, I must do my due diligence and ask a few questions about the haunting. This will allow your claim to progress, but you still may be subjected to an investigator to attend your property and determine that your supernatural activity is genuine, and that the amount of money you are claiming is proportionate to the damage inflicted. Does this all make sense to you"?

"*Yes, it all makes sense. I do hope you are able to process my claim quickly though. My family and I have been through an ordeal and we really don't need this dragging on"*.

"Well Sir, if you talk me through the strange occurrences you experienced, then we can get this process moving. You can start by telling me how the haunting began".

"*The first occurrence happened just a little over a month ago. It started small, in fact I barely noticed it. It was a cold night and so I was sitting in front of the fireplace, poking at the embers after the flames had died out. The wife and kids were in bed and so it was just me. I was the only one that saw it*. 

*In the ashes, just for a moment, I saw two eyes staring back at me. It's hard to describe exactly, but it looked as if two eyeballs appeared within the cluster of coal. They appeared as if they were still on fire. Like the eye's themselves were burning*".

"Let me guess, things escalated after that?"

*"Yeah, unfortunately. The next thing that happened involved our family photos. I don't know exactly how long they had been damaged, but it was about a week after the fireplace incident that I noticed the first photograph*. 

*Along the mantle, just above the fireplace, there has always been a photo of my family. It was taken during a family trip to the zoo. In front of the monkey enclosure actually, but nevermind. The point is, every single one of our eyes had been burned out of the picture. Small burn holes were present where our eyes should've been. On every single one of us. My three kids. My wife. And me. All of us had our eyes burnt out.*

*I was shocked when I first saw it, and so I went to look at other family pictures that are hung up on the walls. To my surprise, I saw that our eyes had been reduced to small burn holes in every photo in the house*".

"Hmm burn marks in the photos. Was this the extent of the property damage or has there been more"?

*"There was more. In the following days, the kids found small burn marks across the walls. They were always circular, and about the size of a ping pong ball. They always came in two as well. Two small holes burnt into the wall, right next to each other. I think in the few days between discovering the burnt photos and when we all saw him, we must've found a dozen or so of these strange burns*". 

"What do you mean, 'when we all saw him'"?

"*I mean what I said. We all saw him. The man with fire in his eyes. We were all sitting around the kitchen table, saying grace before eating, when I felt a sharp pain in my hand. I looked down and saw that my flesh was starting to burn. I could see the skin starting to blister and the smell of cooked meat started to fill the air.*

*I screamed and jumped up out of my seat, to the shock of everyone else sitting at the table. I desperately looked around the room, trying to determine what was causing my hand to burn. I quickly found the source*. 

*At the other end of the table, standing just behind my wife, was a man who was staring straight towards me. Towards my hand. His eyes were different than any I had seen before. Instead of the normal brown or blue eyes, his were a bright orange. And they were flickering. Almost like a small flame had been lit inside his pupil. The rest of his eye was normal, but instead of a colour, there were flames*. 

*Of course, I screamed again, this time pointing towards him. My family's collective eyesight turned to where my finger was pointing, and they all saw him too.*"

"A man with flames in his eyes?"

*"Yes. Ask my wife. Even ask my children for God's sake. They all saw the same thing. The man was burning eyes*".

"Okay, Sir. This is what is going to happen now. If you wish to take this claim further, one of our investigators will be sent to your home. They will look for evidence of your claims and it will be up to their discretion whether or not the compensation will be paid out to you. Do you understand?"

*"Yes*".



The recording ended. I had already listened to it a couple of times, but it's best to familiarise yourself with the case you are about to investigate. Paranormal Insurance sure loves to send us investigators out before they pay a cent out to a client. 

It's understandable I suppose, they don't want to pay money out to someone faking a haunting. But, on the other side of the coin, someone who has truly experienced a supernatural occurrence doesn't usually want to deal with an insurance broker straight afterwards. This can lead to being met with a certain degree of animosity. 

I was certain that this particular case was a hoax, and so I really hoped that the hostility was kept to a minimum. 

In the recording, I noticed a slight change in tone from the phone operator when he asked about the man with flames in his eyes. I knew that the customer service rep also came to this realisation that this was fake as soon as that distinct entity was mentioned.

This was, of course, because this spirit was linked with our most famous, and most lucrative case. 

It was an old case that involved similar elements to what I was now investigating. Burnt photos. Small burn marks on the walls. And a man with flames in his eyes. At the time, it was deemed a hoax, and no money was paid out to the man who filed the claim. It was only after his death that a large sum was given to his grieving family. 

This case must have gained traction in some local press, and soon enough, a number of people were familiar with it. This meant that a number of people started faking hauntings and trying to claim that they were also victims to the Flame-Eyed Man. I thought this was such a case. 

I opened the door to my car and got out, grabbing my briefcase as I did. I had parked just a little way from the property, just far away enough for the occupants to not see my car. I started to walk towards the giant house, and I was a little taken aback by its beauty and craftsmanship. 

A high iron gate protected the gorgeous property within. A two storey, wood panelled  house sat just inside of the fences perimeter. I approached the iron barrier and, as I did, it began to slide open. The occupants must've seen me arrive. 

I stepped through the gate and started to walk along the cobbled path that led to the wide verandah that ran along the front of the property. Waiting for me at the front door was a middle aged man wearing sunglasses. I assumed this was the person who filed the insurance claim.

He greeted me with a slight nod and a monotone "morning". I outstretched my hand to greet him in a more professional manner. He too reached his hand outwards and clasped mine. I wanted to properly meet this man, but I do confess that the handshake also had an ulterior motive. 

As he took my hand, I quickly glanced down and took a peak at the back of his hand. Two small burn marks were present on his flesh. They were still blistering and so I decided that they were still relatively fresh. I was almost surprised to see the charred skin, but managed to keep my composure. Either, this man's claims were indeed true, or he was very committed to the hoax. Some people go to desperate lengths for money. 

I finished shaking his hand, and began to introduce myself. I explained who I was, what my job was and that I would need access to the house in order to assess his claims. I didn't give any indication that I was suspicious of his story. 

He introduced himself as Max, and then opened the door for me, granting me entry to his home. As I entered, he told me that his kids were upstairs and his wife was in the kitchen. He didn't take off his sunglasses even as we entered the dimly lit house.

"If possible, I would like to speak with the entire family. It helps me gain a better understanding of what exactly happened here, you know. Let's me see the whole picture", I said to him in a polite manner.

"Yeah sure. I can't imagine you will be here long though. You will see the true damage of this entity and then you will be on your way", he replied, sounding frustrated that I was even here snooping around. 

He then called out for his kids to come downstairs, which echoed through the house's large front room. 

He then gestured for me to follow him, and so I tailed behind him until he stopped in front of the door that led out into the hallway. 

"Here is one of those burn marks I told your company about", he said as he pointed towards two small black marks on the wall. They looked almost identical to the burn marks that were on Max's hand. 

I studied the marks, which had clearly been the result of a small fire. It was entirely possible that one of the family member's had burnt them into the wooden wall, but I couldn't prove that this was the case. 

Max then pointed down the hallway and said "You'll find another four of these marks down there". 

I stepped out into the passageway and sure enough, I found another four pairs of identical burn marks. Possibly the work of a human. Or maybe it was the Flame Eyed Man that had caused them. 

The other thing that I noticed as I wandered down the lengthy hallway were the family photos that lined the walls.

One was taken at the beach. Another at a theme park, and one was from a professional photoshoot. The photos all had two things in common. Each one was of all five members of the family, smiling and enjoying each other's company. The other similarity was the small holes that were through each family member's eyes. The paper was charred around the circumference of the holes, indicating that they had been burnt out. 

"It's the same with every photo in the house", Max said from behind me. 

"I'm sure it is", I responded. 

Max walked to the end of the hallway and through a large door. I followed and found myself entering the kitchen, which was renovated and modern. At the other side of the room, a long, black table was situated. Three young girls and a woman in her forties were sitting around the table. Obviously, this was the family.

The next hour consisted of me asking numerous questions about the haunting. About exactly what everyone saw. Surprisingly, all their stories lined up and everyone saw the same thing. A man with flames in his eyes.

The three girls, all of who were around the age of 10, seemed genuinely frightened as they recounted what had happened that night at dinner. They were starting to convince me that it could be real. Maybe this wasn't a hoax. But, that was not a good thing. Not for the family. 

Only once has a claim about the Flame Eyed Man ended up with money being paid out. That claim, as I said before, was paid out to the man's family and not to him. That's because that case had ended in his death. He was found, alone in his home with both eyes clawed out and the sockets burnt. Meaning they had burnt after his eyes had been removed. 

It was a grisly end, and one that I didn't wish upon this family. I was unsure what to do though. I just needed one more piece of evidence to prove that this haunting was real. Just something solid that would allow the family to get the money they were claiming. It was only a small amount, but it might mean a little bit of happiness before they met their untimely end. 

I asked the family sitting around the table if it was okay if I took their photograph. They agreed and so I reached into my briefcase and pulled out a polaroid camera I had in there. I asked them to look towards the lens, and then snapped the photo. 

It let out a flash and then a slight whirring sound as the polaroid began to print. The blank photo came out of the camera, but there was something different about this polaroid film. There were ten small holes scattered across it.

I was shocked at what I saw and looked on in horror as the photo began to develop. The picture of the family started to form, with each face lining up with the holes. Two holes lined up perfectly with each family member's face. Right across their eyes. 

This was all the evidence that I needed to prove that this haunting was legitimate. I had everything I needed. I thanked the family for their time, and assured them that they would receive their money, but I didn't have the heart to tell them how the previous case had ended. 

Max thanked me, and he actually smiled slightly when I told them that they would be getting the money. 

"Thank you for your time", he said, "Let me walk you out".

He stood and so I did too. I followed him out the kitchen, through the rest of the house and out the front door. As we stepped out onto the verandah, Max stopped and turned around to face me. 

"I haven't quite told you everything", he said seriously, "That's because I haven't even told my wife and kids everything". 

I stared at him confused, waiting for him to fill me in on what he had left out before. He continued. 

"I have seen the man with flame in his eyes again. Since that time at dinner. I've seen him three more times in fact", he said as he unbuttoned the collar of his shirt. 

Two more pairs of burn marks were present across his chest and on his neck. He then reached up and slid the sunglasses off his face, revealing charred flesh around his eyes. His eyes were bloodshot, and quite clearly burnt. 

"I saw him this morning. We made eye contact.", he said, fear present in his voice. 

He continued, "He showed me things. As he looked into my eyes, burning me, he showed me. He showed me the fiery pits. The blood soaked ground. The intense heat. I even heard the screams. He showed me Hell". 

Max looked towards the ground, afraid and upset. 

"He made me look at it. I couldn't bear it. I just wanted to rip my eyes out to make the visions stop. I actually wished he would burn my eyes out so that I wouldn't have to see it anymore", he said before stopping.

I believed him. I believed every word of it, and in that moment, I felt a fear I had never experienced before. I had investigated many hauntings and ghost sightings, but I had never experienced anything like this before. The man in front of me looked broken. He looked like what he had seen had shaken him to his core. 

I felt my fear rise even more when I felt the sharp burning pain in my back. I spun around sharply, trying to see what was causing it, and I got a glimpse of him. The Flame Eyed Man. He stood on the other side of the verandah. Looking at me. Burning into me with his gaze. 

The burning pain stopped and the man's flickering pupils disappeared, along with the rest of him. He was real. He was haunting this family. He did exist. I will always remember him and the flames within his eyes. And I will always be thankful that he didn't make eye contact with me.

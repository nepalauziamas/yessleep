PART 2

I didn’t see Lily for nearly a month. I was too scared to be alone with her, even if Sam was there. So after much thought, I decided I needed to confront her. I invited her for coffee at a small cafe not too far from my house.

As soon as we were seated, she began to fidget. Her eyes were anywhere but me, and as much as she tried to remain calm and collected, I could see right through her.

“Lily, I’m going to be up front with you. I know you make Sam very happy, but I also know there is more to you than meets the eye. So, tell me, what exactly are your plans?” I ask.

“Um, well, I love Sam. A lot. I really do see myself spending the rest of my life with him. I don’t want anything to come in the way of that,” she replied.

“What do you mean by that? What’s in the way?” I pushed.

“Oh, well, nothing, I just mean, well, I just-“

“What are you planning, Lily? I know there’s more going on than you have told me. And I’m here right now for answers.”

“What? I don’t know what you’re talking about,” she insisted.

“Yes you do, and if you continue to lie to me, I will tell Sam everything. Your relationship will be over,” I sit back in my seat and smirk. I know I’ve got her now.

“You don’t want to do that,” Lily replies, slowly grabbing her coffee without looking at me.

“I do,” I pressed, leaning forward.

She didn’t say anything, and her phone rang a moment later, summoning her to go.

She said goodbye, and nearly gagged over the words, “it was nice to see you.” 

I didnt believe her.

At the six month mark Sam returned home following an afternoon outing with one of his best friends from high school. I have to admit it was great to see him out with his friends more, and less with Lily, who I had yet to see again after our last encounter.

Sam had also been extremely stand-offish, despite me barely hearing about him going out with Lily. It was worrisome.

It was even more worrisome when he sat me down at our kitchen table and told me he was going to purpose. 

The ring was beautiful. Worth more than Lily deserved. He had this huge elaborate plan, too. He was going to get her to meet him at their first date spot at sunrise, a beautiful beach about an hour away.

I smiled at him, hoping it’s falseness wouldn’t show. I told him I was happy for him and I couldn’t wait to start planning the wedding. But I was also terrified. Terrified Lily would follow through with whatever plan she had to get me out of the picture now that they were going to be engaged.

I didn’t sleep at all that night. I drank my coffee as the sun rose and awaited Sam’s arrival home. 

He appeared glum as he walked in the door. He told me she had stood him up. Wouldn’t answer any of his calls or texts. A part of me was relieved. A part of me was heartbroken for my son. I know how much he loved her.

A week later was when everyone realized it was more than just Sam being stood up. Nobody had heard anything from Lily. She hadn’t been to work, back home, or talked to any of her family or friends.

I feared she was out there. Lurking. Waiting to finish whatever scheme she’d been working so hard on.

Police got involved, and found her car in a warehouse. Not only was her car there, but the whole garage was filled with all different kinds of knives, hammers, rope, and other tools that would be perfect to commit whatever morbid crime Lily was planning.

I swear, the night after her car was found. I saw her exact outline perched outside my window. I even found a press on nail, the exact colour and shape Lily had on before she left, in the spot I had seen her by the window.

I checked and double checked the locks every night after that. Just to be extra safe. Just in case, some how, she came back.

Or worse, in case she came back to end me.

I was slowly starting to feel at ease as the weeks passed. It was coming up on the one month anniversary of Lily’s disappearance. Sam was slowly losing hope in her return. I did try my best to relieve his pain, while pretending to grieve with him. Pretending that I wasn’t relieved that I was slowly being released from the fear Lily had imbedded within me.

It was a rainy sunday afternoon. The perfect time to clear work on some much needed spring cleaning. 

I was working on scrubbing mildew from my shower while Sam began clearing out my cabinet.

“Thank you so much for helping me, we used to do stuff like this all the time, I missed it a lot,” I said.

When he didn’t respond I turned to face him. His eyes were white, skin pale as a ghost. In his hand he held a small, dainty golden chain. Certainly worth a pretty penny. It would be easy to sell.

“Mom,” he began, “why do you have this?”

My eyes narrowed, “what do you mean?”

“Mom,” his voice hardened, “Mom this is Lily’s.”

“Oh, she must’ve forgotten it here.”

“No, no Mom she wears this every day. It was her grandmothers. Why do you have this… oh my god is this blood? why is there blood on Lily’s-“ he paused, breath catching in his throat. “What did you do?”

I didn’t speak at first. I knew I had to choose my next words carefully.

“I saved you. I saved us! You saw all of those murder weapons she had in that garage. She was going to kill us!” I pleaded.

“She’s a car mechanic! There was a reason she-“ Sam choked mid sentence, his eyes darkened.

“Tell me. What did you do?” he breathed, tears welling in his eyes.

When I don’t answer, he repeats himself. More aggressively this time. With more urgency.

“Mom, what did you do?!”

I know he will be upset with me for many days when I answer his question. Maybe even months, or years. But someday he will understand. He will be grateful.

Nobody will ever, ever be able to take my son away from me.

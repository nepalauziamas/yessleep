In summer, we used visit our suburb. Pretty old house, cozy couch in terrace and a beautiful dog that we brought.

&#x200B;

Remember sitting in the terrace, seeing my little sister playing with her toys that we both made. Back then she was like 6 years old and I was big enough to read Mark Twain. 

&#x200B;

We had this tv of ours, watching horror movies at night. Once there was this scary character that crawls in the night time, coming from the forests and eating people alive. My sister had a creepy imagination that she was this gory crippled being, crawling behind the tables and stealing stuff from me as if she was a little prankster or something.

&#x200B;

This one time, it was late, sky getting darker, trees around losing essence and starting to live another - night life. In the darkness trees look to you with their dreadful wisdom. Their height and secrets scare you. 

When time came, I called Emily to come back. Enough of games, time to go home. Dog suddenly heard something unfamiliar and ran towards the place where Emily played. My own breath, wind and trees were the only noise makers I could recognize. 

&#x200B;

\- Emily! - I called once again. Nothing came to response and I started getting frightened. 

&#x200B;

Zeus found her. She was crawling in the dark, crawling towards the house but dog doesn't greet her. In fact, he attacks her, grabs her head, shakes as if its a dead spilled baby doll and shakes, shakes, shakes! I command Zeus to stop and scared for my little sisters life, try pulling him of. Of, of the dreadful creature. This monstrous, filthy face of a 80 year old, eyes yellow and red, reflecting the light of the moon. The shriek of this being went further than the tree that are seeking endless skies. And the scarred hand, thrusting into Zeu's eyes. 

&#x200B;

\- I ate your sister! - the thing screamed. Laughing and screaming. Rolling over in dirt and biting Zeus. At that time I lost consciousness. 

&#x200B;

In the morning I woke up in the middle of forest. My hands were dirty, I was shaking from cold. Couldn't remember what happened last night, how I got here. And then I see my house. Walking in, everything is in the place, Emily is sleeping, tv is on and Zeus sitting behind the table. 

&#x200B;

What a strange occurrence, I think for a moment. Then I go sleep.

&#x200B;

Bz. Bz. Phone beeps. 

&#x200B;

\- Hello?

\- Its mom, wanted to ask how... - A glance over the window and there's 5 FACES STARRING. Dull look and as I scream, Emily wakes up screaming, shouting. Dog helplessly squeals and I begin crying. As creatures crawl under our house, I fall down, lose conscious for a moment, grab a knife and run towards the vibrating phone. Call the police and believe me or not, when they come, abonimations are gone. 

&#x200B;

Emily had a small scar around her eye, Zeus seemed worse - he had scratches all over his face. And yet it all happened around 20 years ago.

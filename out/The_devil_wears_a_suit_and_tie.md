Johnny had loved Caroline since the first day of high school. I’d loved Caroline since the first time I saw her. We were five years old and I jumped off the swings with my eyes shut, trying to fly. I’d cried when I hit the ground, even though my daddy said boys didn't cry and would have cuffed me round the back of my head if he’d seen. A girl in a pink sundress came running over, pigtails flying, ribbons untied and crouched next to me.

“Why you cryin’?” She asked me, all brown eyes.

“I’m not!” I had said, shoving the tears angrily away.

“Whats your name?”

I sniffed. “Sam.”

“I’m Caroline.” She had reached out towards the fresh scrape on my knee and brushed her little finger over it. It came away, red with blood, and she smiled.

“It will be alright,” she said, and I believed her.

Me and Johnny, named after the late and great by his daddy, had been best friends since middle school. Our pops liked to drink together after their shifts on the building site for the new library in town. Me and Johnny liked to drink together too. We spent most nights driving our trucks as fast as we could down the strip of highway between the cow fields just outside of town, until the sky and stars blurred into a mess above us and it felt like I was flying if I closed my eyes, hurtling into the dark foot slammed down on the gas. We’d howl out the windows at the moon, filling the night with our sound, whiskey we stole from our fathers hot and burning in our guts, like we were running from the Devil himself. Small town boys destined for a life driving over the speed limit.

We had finally made it through senior year, almost to the end. Drought had killed every lawn in town, and our teachers had all doubted me and Johnny would get this far. I’d doubted it too, but here we were. I had just been kicked off the football team for smoking a little something green with Johnny in the parking lot. It wasn’t the first time we’d been caught.

I was distraught; not because I liked football, I’d only done it to make my old man proud. But because Caroline was a cheerleader and it had given me an excuse to talk to her after practice, or at away games on the bus over. It wasn't like we were close friends, but we’d know each other so long we had an easiness with each other, smiling when we passed in the corridors. She had come to my mama’s funeral in freshman year, looking so pretty in her black dress behind the Georgia sky I couldn't help staring. She’d seen me cry then too, when she found me hiding round the back of the church so my dad wouldn't see.

“It will be alright,” she said, and I believed her.

Johnny was trying to convince me to help him crash a party that night, leaning against the lockers, staring at girls as they passed with his wolf\-smile, all teeth and eyes that made them blush. Johnny had a new girl every month. I was always too nervous to talk to them, except for Caroline. She always teased me, saying half the cheer squad was begging her for my number, apparently seeing me as a strong but silent type instead of just painfully shy. I never asked why she didn't actually ever give it out. Caroline approached us now, strawberry hair like waves down her back.

“Hey gorgeous,” Johnny drawled, flashing his teeth. Caroline smiled sweetly and flipped him off, red nail polish chipped. I snorted and turned to her, wondering why she had graced us with her presence. She was wearing a light blue sweater with a loose thread hanging from the collar. Unthinking I reached out and pulled it away. She smiled up at me, not the wide fake one she’d given to Johnny but something small and soft. Just for me.

“Heard you done ’n got yourself kicked off the team,” she said. I ran a hand through my hair, suddenly embarrassed. Me and Johnny were always getting into stupid shit together, she knew that, but she looked a little disappointed as she spoke.

“Wasn’t like he was gonna be a pro,” Johnny clapped a hand on my shoulder. It was true. Our high school was dirt poor and underfunded, grass long dead on the football field. The football team was made up of boys who lived in trailer parks and the cheer squad was full of dead eyed girls who knocked back painkillers after practice. I knew my daddy had different ideas, saw that team as my way out of this town. There was going to be hell to pay when I got home. She laughed, rolling her eyes.

“We’ll miss you,” she said, over her shoulder. We both watched her as she walked away, Johnny unashamedly staring at her ass, me wishing I’d said something better, something that made her laugh like Johnny did.

“We’ll miss you too,” Johnny whistled low under his breath, still staring. “God she’s pretty as pie.” Johnny slammed my locker shut, and slung one pale arm round my neck. “Lets skip.” I punched him in the arm and we shoved each other down the corridor, Johnny fishing a bottle of bourbon from the bottom of his bag as we crossed the parking lot in the afternoon sun.

I got home the same time the moon came out. I was drunk and laughing at myself as I struggled with my key in the door, hands made useless by the bourbon. Our pitbull Sadie jumped up to meet me and I shushed her, laughing as quiet as I could. Party had been boring, just a house full of kids getting high in someone's living room, family photos looking down from the walls as people danced and kissed and threw up. I’d kissed Tracie to the sound of a song I'd never heard before, something about [a cocaine jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdVubZ6fZaU). Tracie was of Johnny’s ex girls that he’d never treated right.

She’d sat on my lap and told me I had sad eyes before she passed out and I carried her to her friends car so they could drive her home safe. When I got in, my old man was asleep on the couch sitting up, TV still switched to a late night special. I pushed the empty Lone Star cans from his lap and covered him with a blanket. He looked so small when he was asleep, my dad, lines smoothed clean from his face. I fell asleep thinking about Caroline, wondering if she liked my eyes.

I woke up with a headache like God was pressing a thumb between my brows, making me pay for my sins. Dad was eating breakfast in the kitchen, and silently pushed a plate of burnt bacon and eggs across the table for me. Since mama was gone, we had to the cooking now. I liked it, was even good at it, but dad always complained it was girly, refused to eat anything that wasn't deep fried or red meat.

I fed our pitbull Sadie the blackest bits of bacon under the table, her nose like wet velvet in the palm of my hand. We ate in silence, sunlight peeking through the gaps in the blinds firmly closed over the kitchen windows. When the weather was right dad would take me hunting. I hated killing the deer with their beautiful brown eyes, tripping peaceful on their white feet through the trees. I did though, to make my old man happy. I never missed, every shot to try and make him proud. The only time we talked properly since mom died was with blood on our hands, stripping down the deer with the hunting knife he’d bought me on my twelfth birthday. If I’d done good he’d crack me a beer and we’d lean against the truck in silence watching the sunset burn down the sky.

On Sunday we went to church, left Sadie in the backyard barking at airplanes leaving trails in the ether. I watched Dad clean the dirt from under his nails in the kitchen sink, washing the week off his hands. He drove us in easy silence, Bruce Springsteen singing [*Nebraska*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iir_xAbt-ak) on the radio. We sat on the back pew, as always, space to his left where mama used to sit empty in the sun that streamed through the dusty church windows. Sweat like dew formed beneath the collar of my shirt and I ran a finger underneath, scraping my skin, until Dad gave me a warning look and I stopped. The reverend was talking about sin in these hard times, only ourselves to blame lack of water and jobs in this town. Caroline sat up front between her parents, younger brother Taylor with the same strawberry hair on the end of their bench. The reverend raised his arms, as the wooden cross behind him cast its shadow on the congregation. The devil was comin’ for us all he said, and the congregation hummed, because we knew it was true.

On Monday morning I drove Johnny to school with his namesake singing through the radio [*your own personal jesus.. .*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpYW3qng78E)He’d blown a tire on his own truck the week before and it was still sitting sad in his drive way. *Someone to hear your prayers…* Johnny had no money to fix it and his dad had laughed right in his face when he’d asked to borrow some cash to get it done. *Someone who cares…* He ranted to me about this for the whole drive, past the drug store and the liquor store, neon signs switched off in the daylight. I wondered what he’d say if he knew my dad had left bruises on my stomach when I told him about getting kicked off the team. Johnny was my best friend, but he didn’t know me at all, I realised. Maybe I didn't know him.

I parked up on the far side of the parking lot. We sat in the back seats, AC blasting, drinking the six pack of Coors Light I’d swiped from the fridge to chase away any lingering hangover from the weekend. Caroline and a group of her friends walked past in their cheer uniforms and Johnny leaned out the window and whistled long and loud.

Her friends shrieked and giggled, shoving at each other, playing at being mad. Becka Jackson was 4 months pregnant and it was starting to show, her uniform tight against her belly. Caroline flipped him off, waving when she recognised me in the back seat. I waved back, heart beat stuttering. Johnny laughed until he spilt beer down his shirt. He turned to me, his wolf smile on.

“Jesus christ but I’m asking her to prom,” he said. My heart dropped, dead weight in my chest. Prom was on Friday. “That sweet girl ain’t gonna be so sweet by the time I’m done,” he winked at me. I chugged the rest of my beer so I’d have something to do with my hands instead of punching him.

Johnny asked her to prom that afternoon, and she told him no, laughing not unkindly. She’d already been asked by half the boys in senior year; another one didn’t phase her. The next day, he turned up to school with a bouquet of store\-bought red roses and asked again. She said no, taking the roses and dropping them neatly in a trash can as she walked away. Everybody laughed. Johnny didn't like that.

“Little bitch!” he yelled under the night sky, throwing his empty whiskey bottle at the fence. It exploded, glass like falling stars in the long blue grass where the pieces fell. I sat on the hood of my truck, drinking with my head tilted back so everything looked upside down. I closed my eyes, wondering if I drank enough and leaned back far enough, I’d just fall right into the sky.

“Sam! Quit fuckin’ around and get in the truck,” I opened my eyes. Johnny was standing inches from my face, wolf smile wide and white. “We got somewhere to be.”

I drove us through the dark, headlights making strange shapes in the dirt below. Johnny would tell me this way and that, and I followed him blind, hands gripping the wheel to keep me steady. Johnny told me to stop, sudden, and I slammed the breaks, Johnny yelling with laughter as the truck skid to a stop, tire tracks like scars on the road. Johnny jumped from the passenger seat, leaving the door gaping wide into the night. I was seeing double, two different skies, two different Johnny’s. Music drifted from the radio I’d forgotten to turn off as the singer pleaded [*Only thing I'd ask is please...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLs0fp-MarE) I stepped out into the headlight beams. *Oh*\*, devil, dont you fool me..\*.\*The ground spun beneath me as I followed after Johnny. *Well I got a woman on my mind…*

We were at a cross roads.

Four dirt roads led away into the yawn of the darkness. The night thrummed, alive with cicada song and sounds coming from the trees. Johnny walked to the centre, where the roads all met. Silence fell, moon half full like a wink in the sky, watching us. Something crawled in the walls of my stomach, fear slowly seeping through the whiskey that filled my head and belly. I watched as he took several things from his pocket, holding them up so I could see, grinning. A pocket knife with a red plastic handle. The lighter I’d given him for christmas, emblazoned with a smiling playboy bunny. And a photo, cut from last years yearbook. Caroline.

I stepped forward, maybe to take it from him, maybe to ask what the hell he was doing. Johnny held up his right hand, palm facing me, telling me to stop. His eyes were cold, soulless in the dark where I couldn't see the blue so clearly. I stopped. Johhny dug his hands into the earth digging down into the perfect centre of the crossroads. He took the knife and dragged it across his left hand. His face was still as the blade bit in, as if he couldn't feel it. Blood dripped dark and he drew his hand into a fist, squeezing. It dripped, slow like syrup into the hole he had made in the dirt. Then he took the photo of Caroline, kissed it once and touched the lighter to the corner. I watched her face burn, red hair blurring with the flames until there was nothing but ashes in the dirt. Johnny covered up the hole and stood, walking back to the truck with a swing in his step. I followed like a dog.

I woke up the next day, and listened to the sound of the ceiling fan until I had to sprint for the toilet, emptying my stomach into the chipped porcelain. Sadie watched me from the doorway, wagging her tail. She pad over and bumped me with her soft grey head until I fed her. Dad had already left for work and I was late for school. My truck was in the drive way, although I couldn't remember driving it home. I called Johnny, asking if he needed a ride but he wouldn't pick up. I drove to school in a daze, chewing aspirin and flipping through radio stations. A singer and his guitar came on as he told me [*Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQec64G2iXo) I wondered what the fuck Johnny had been doing last night. *Saw him driving down the 61’ in early July…* It seemed dream like now, lost in the whiskey blur of my memories. *White as a cotton field and sharp as a knife…* I remembered blood and broken glass and Caroline’s face, watching me as she burned. *I heard him howling as he passed me by…*

I found Johnny in the parking lot at the end of the day. He was sitting on the hood of a cherry red Corsa. Caroline’s car. He was surrounded by a group of her friends, laughing and chatting with him. His arm was around Caroline’s shoulders as she leaned into him, eyes never leaving his face, smile small and soft. Just for him.

“Sam!” he yelled, shit eating grin stretching lazy across his face. “Guess who’s gonna be my prom date after all.” He kissed Caroline on her temple, the same way he’d kissed her picture. She blushed, hiding her face in his jacket. I smiled and bumped the fist he raised for me with my own, while my heart curled up and died inside the cavity of my chest. Tracie was stood at the back of the group smoking a cigarette. She handed it to me wordlessly and I took a drag like a drowning man clinging to life. We talked a while and by the time the cigarette was finished I’d agreed to take her to prom. I liked Tracie, with her black hair and cowboy boots and dirty jokes. We were friends, but we both new that someone else made my heart beat loud.

I didn’t want to go home, couldn't face overthinking the way Johnny’s arm had looked around her shoulders, thumb brushing the gentle dip of her collar bones. I drove with the windows down and the radio blasting so loud I couldn't think. The sun tipped itself from the sky as it turned orange and gold, bleeding into the clouds. The speed dial shift to 80, to 90, to 100, and I closed my eyes and I slammed the gas, heart pounding a bruise on the walls of insides. If I went a little faster, for just a little longer, kept my eyes closed, I knew I would fly.

When I got home, dad already positioned on the couch half way down a glass of bourbon, I shut myself in my room. I lifted my mattress and pulled one of the bottles of Jack Daniels I kept stocked underneath. My shirt was soaked with sweat, adrenaline and the endless heat that filled the days responsible. I yanked it off and put my headphones in, falling on top of the covers as outside the windows, night crawled across the sky, power lines cutting through the stars, houses on the street turning on their lights one by one. I drank until I was staring at the bottom of the bottle, my last thought \- Caroline’s face as she burned.

I woke up to hands on my shoulders shaking me. Rough hands I knew so well, deep brown, scarred and stained from working outside. Then I was cold. So cold. Was it raining? Was the drought finished? I opened my eyes, vision blurred, still sucker\-punch drunk. I was in the shower, water set to freezing, making the denim of my jeans cling to my skin. I shook my head under the spray. I wanted to get out from the ice of the water. Rough hands, big but gentle pushed me back under, until my head cleared. I vomited between my legs, watching it circle the drain and get sucked under. The hands clapped me on the back, soothing as best they could. Dad.

It was 2am when I walked into the kitchen. I’d changed into sweatpants, my feet bare and my hair wet and curling round the base of my neck. My old man sat at the table, head resting on his hands, Sadie sleeping on his feet. He stood when he saw me, Sadie opening one eye. He stared at me a moment, silent, grey eyes unreadable. His hand flew to my face. I didn’t flinch and I could tell from experience it wouldn't leave a bruise in the morning. We looked so similar me and my dad, except for my hair, blonde like my mama’s. His eyes shifted and he grabbed for me. I took a step back, ready to take it, but he grabbed me into a hug, crushing me against his chest. I stared at the wall with his arms around me as he cried into my shoulder. I had never seen him cry, not even when mama died. I put my arms round him too. I was taller than him now.

He pushed me away after a moment, sniffing and scrubbing his eyes.

“Boy you’re a fuckin’ idiot. You dumb fuckin’ idiot Sammy.” He hadn't called me Sammy since I was a kid. Only mama ever did. His voice was low, not yelling, a tell tale sign he was really mad. “Thought I almost lost you.” His voice broke and he looked away, flannel shirt sleeves rolled, rattlesnake tattoo peeking out on his forearm. “When I found you lyin’ there in your own puke…” he broke off and sighed, suddenly seeming so tired. I’d been so busy growing up, chasing girls and fucking about with Johnny, I hadn't noticed he’d been getting older too. He grabbed the collar of my t\-shirt into a fist, yanking me down to his eye level. “Don’t ever pull that shit again.” I nodded, and realised his eyes weren't angry. They were scared.

My old man was not a man of many words on a good day, so we left it at that. We didn’t speak of it the next day, probably never would, but I made him breakfast and he muttered a gruff thank you, which was more than I usually got. I watched him from the kitchen doorway when he thought I was in the bathroom, as he emptied our cupboards of booze, filling a trash bag almost to the top with liquor bottles. He left for work with a hand briefly on my shoulder, whistling for Sadie to come ride shotgun. I decided to skip school all together, couldn't stand the idea of seeing Caroline and Johnny, his hands in her back pockets. I walked, stopping at the gas station, sun spreading its hands slow on my back. I walked past the church, white against the empty blue of the sky. I sat by my mothers grave and placed the gas station flowers against the headstone.

*Alice Monroe*

*“Gone from our homes but not our hearts.”*

I talked to her a while, about my old man, how Sadie stilled looked for her in the house sometimes, how I was set to start working construction with dad once the summer ended. Bees hummed distant in the wildflowers that grew just beyond the last of the gravestones. Then I just sat in silence a while, smoking a Lucky Strike, careful not to get ash near my mama’s grave.

I walked home on the cracked tarmac of the road, weeds dying of thirst on the roadside. The road took me past Caroline’s house, one\-storey with a wrap around porch just like mine. She was hanging out laundry in their yard. I watched her drifting between the white sheets lit up in the afternoon light. Her red hair fell over her arms as she stretched them above her head, covered in freckles, gifts from the sun.

“Caroline!” she turned, hair spinning out behind her. She grinned in her cut off denim shorts as I crossed the dead grass towards her.

“Hey there stranger,” she said, laundry basket leaning against her hip beneath her arm. “You weren’t around today.”

“Nah, I had better things to do.” She smiled at that.

“Heard you’re taking Tracie to prom!” Her face lit up at the thought of friday night. “We’re all gonna be here before, to drink a little, dance a little. You should come.”

“Johnny too?” I had to ask. Her eyes turned dreamy at the sound of his name.

“Ain’t he just the best?” She went on and on after that. Johnny had bought a tie to match the white lace of her dress was’t he just so thoughtful, Johnny had promised to drive them there in his daddy’s car, wasn’t he just a gentleman, wasn’t Johnny just a regular dream boy.

“Care, I gotta head home,” I told her gently, after I couldn't bear to hear any more. Her brown eyes focused, coming back to reality, to the air dried laundry and the dead grass.

“See you tomorrow Sam,” she said.

I watched her till she was inside before I turned away.

Thursday night me and Dad watched the football on TV. He’d brought home chicken, buckets warm in our laps. Sadie licked the grease from my hands as I stroked her between the eyes until she dozed off on the couch between us. Tracie was meant to be coming over with her dress to show me, so I could match to it. She was late and the sky had turned a murky blue, stars too shy to show yet. I saw her headlights from outside before I saw her. Sadie jumped up to greet her as she stepped in through the screen door. Tracie bent down, kissing her on the head, rubbing behind her ears. Sadie’s tail thumped on the floor with pure joy. I smiled to myself at the look on Tracie’s face; I could tell she wasn't half as mean as she wanted people to believe.

Her dress was cornflower blue. It had been what both her older sisters wore to their proms. It went unsaid that she couldn't afford a new one. She told me proudly that her mama had been up altering it all of last night as we chain smoked out of my bedroom window, her bare feet propped up in my lap. My old man was listening to an old CD of my mama’s as he washed up and we could hear it through the walls. [*And the devil is at my door...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=erukHUyLQcA)  In our town you didn't wear tuxes to prom, nothing that fancy. You wore the best boots you had, and the best shirt you could find. *Can't stall him, stay clear oh no…* I tried on shirts for Tracie, hands nervous on the buttons as I changed in front of her. *By his side now, I've been running round…* She settled on a pale blue one I usually wore to church, set against my dark brown shoulders. \*Yes it just goes to show god, no he'll never settle down…\*I walked her to her car after and before she drove away she leaned up from the window and kissed the corner of my mouth. I watched her headlights disappear, smiling despite myself.

And then it was prom night. The sky glowed a blushed pink, awash with yellows. Birds flew past the power lines, somewhere south, following the sun. Tracie had said she would meet me at Caroline’s. She was getting a lift there with Caroline’s friend Marla and her boyfriend Jake. I’d known Marla since I had braces, but I didn’t know much about her boyfriend Jake other than he liked to draw, and he’d moved to Georgia from Louisiana last year with his parents. Marla had said it was something about a death in the family they couldn't get over that made them leave. Dad looked up for the couch as I left, and nodded his approval as I adjusted my tie.

“Got yourself a pretty girl there, Sam. Don’t go fuckin’ it up.” He turned back to the TV.

I laughed, softly under my breath, thinking about the way Tracie would look in her dress. I hoped I looked good enough for her. Thinking, with shame, how Caroline would look in her dress.

I drove to Caroline’s, bottle of Jameson in the backseat. I pulled up down the street from her house and walked the rest of the way, sipping straight from the bottle. Johnny’s old mans car was parked pride of place outside the chain link fence. I stepped through the gate, eyeing the house. The screen door hung open and the lights were off inside. I could hear music though. Johnny Cash. I rolled my eyes. Johnny was so self obsessed he’d play the singer he was named for at any opportunity, as if he somehow shared his talent. [*There ain't no grave can hold my body down...*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0MIFHLIzZY) I walked through the open door. I could hear nothing but the music. *When I hear that trumpet sound, I’m gonna rise right out of the ground…*

*“Care?”* I called out into the dark house. “Caroline?”

To my right was her little brothers Taylor’s bedroom. The door was open and I could see his feet on the floor, high tops that were falling apart. It looked like he was lying down. I stepped into the room, confused.

Taylor lay with his eyes open in a pool of blood, sinking slowly into the carpet. His eyes were wide open, the same brown as his sisters. His throat, or what was left of it, had been ripped out. It looked like it had been ripped out by teeth. I dropped the Jameson, bottle smashing, whiskey sinking into the carpet to join the blood. I cried out, reeling, falling from the room. I staggered down the hall, leaning on the wall for support. *Well, look way down the river, what do you think I see…* Caroline’s parents bedroom door was open. They lay hand in hand on the bed, blood turning the sheets red. I turned away, vomit burning my mouth but I kept it in. *I see a band of angels and they're coming after me…* I ran the rest of the way, yelling for Caroline, for Johnny, for Tracie.

I reached the last room, kitchen and living\-room all in one. *Ain't no grave can hold my body down…* Jake and Marla sat on the couch, heads slumped back, staring at the ceiling. Thin red lines across their throats like second smiles. Red dripped into her prom dress. Tracie lay at the foot of the couch, face smeared with her own blood. I ran to her, hands shaking as I tried to find a pulse. I choked with relief. It was there, but it was dull and slow, fading fast. My hands came away wet and red.\* No there ain't no grave can hold my body down\*…

I turned, slowly, feeling the eyes on my back. Caroline was crouched over Johnny’s body, blood slick down her chest. Her white lace dress was soaked to the bone. She smiled, standing slowly. Johnny’s body rolled at her feet, eyes unseeing. Her teeth were filled to the gums with blood, stained red. She had grown an extra row underneath. Like a shark. Her eyes were pure black, wide like two voids in her face. She twirled a hunting knife in her delicate hand, nails polish chipped. I was frozen as she walked towards me, that fucking smile still on her face. She trailed the knife over my lips, soft as a kiss.

“What are you?” I whispered, voice lost in my throat.

She tipped back her head and laughed, showing her many rows of teeth.

“Sam, little Sam. You best get to prayin’ now.” She laughed and I wanted to scream. She shook her head, red hair almost to her waist. “I gave Johnny what he wanted. Now I get what *I* wanted.” When she spoke it echoed, like three voices speaking over each other at the same time. Her black eyes flickered and she gasped, falling to the ground and grabbing at her chest, pulling me with her to our knees. She stared up into my face, her eyes brown. She screamed, low like an animal in pain, tears dripping into her teeth.

“Sam,” she forced out, teeth grinding. “Run.”

Her back arched backwards, spine popping and she snapped back forward, grinning, eyes black. She howled with laughter, three voices at once. I stayed on my knees, as if I was praying, as she stood above me. She kicked Johnny’s lifeless body over.

“Boy, don’t you know the devil always gets his dues?”

Her body shook suddenly, like it was falling apart and she fell back to the the floor, on her knees like she was praying. She looked up at me, breath heaving from her lungs as if they were collapsing. Eyes brown. She howled again, that unnatural laugh like nothing I’d ever heard. Eyes black. She shuddered and her eyes were brown again and full of tears.

“Sammy,” she choked out, grabbing my hands. Pressing something into my fingers. The knife. I shook my head, starting to cry, silent. She wiped the tears from my cheek with one hand stained red. She smiled, something small and soft. Just for me. She nodded, fingers closing over mine as we held the handle together. She guided my hand until the blade was an inch from her chest. From her heart. I’d been in love with Caroline since the day I first saw her. She looked up at me, eyes beautiful and brown. Like a deers. She pressed her forehead against mine and I closed my eyes.

“It will be alright,” she said, as we pushed the knife in. I believed her.

I woke up to the sight of my 2 year old son tapping away on my cell phone. I put out my hand and after a couple of whines and tears he handed the phone back to me. I checked my phone to make sure he didn’t make any phone calls or texts. 

After checking everything on my phone I didn’t find any new calls or texts, but I did see an app called “Life is Beta” on my home screen now. The icon was just a circle inside of a solid blue square.

I put my phone in my pocket, and got ready for work. After I ate my breakfast I kissed my wife and son goodbye and walked to the subway station. The ride to work usually takes around 40 minutes so I turned my phone on and clicked on the app. 

The first thing that threw me off was the fact that there wasn’t a loading screen or anything.  It just automatically jumped to a character floating in the middle of the screen. 

The next weird thing was the character looked just like me in every single way. Even the face was exactly like mine down to the two pimples I found on my forehead this morning. Feeling a bit curious, I tapped on the screen and he started to walk towards the right. The screen turned black for a second, and when it bounced to the next screen I almost dropped my phone. He was sitting in a subway while playing on his cell phone. 

After a couple of seconds the subway in the phone stops, and a couple of people got off and on the subway. Right as a lady in a yellow coat starts to get on the subway my character starts to flash and the scene freezes. I tap on the character and he gets up and bolts out of the subway. I try to tap outside of the subway, but the screen keeps showing the subway. The lady that boarded the subway started to pace around the subway, but no one really gave her notice. 

After she walked around three times she started to shake and took out two guns from her purse. The subway is filled with blood and people running around as she empties out both magazines. Once she ran out of bullets she took a knife out of purse and stabbed herself in the chest. 

The screen on my phone went dark and I felt the subway come to a stop. I looked up and saw a woman in a yellow coat boarding the subway. Without a second thought I ran out of the subway and caught a cab. 

The whole cab ride there I kept searching the news to see if there were any recent shootings in my area, but after a while I started to relax and by the time I got to work I was laughing to myself about how dumb I was listening to a dumb game. Right as I sat down in my office chair I got a phone call from my wife. When I picked up the phone I heard my wife say “Please, please, please, just answer the phone.” I said “Hello?” and I could hear her breathe a sigh of relief. She told me that she was watching the news when she heard about a lady shooting up the subway I usually rode to work. Right as she told me everything that happened I couldn’t really respond. I felt my hand start to shake and my throat felt like it was closing up. I told her I love her and that I would call her back later and hung up the phone. 

I turned the app again, and saw that my character was floating in the middle of the screen. I kept tapping at him, but the screen would not change. I clicked the home button to my phone and tried deleting the app, but my phone did not give an option to delete the app. Frustrated and scared shitless, I just shoved my phone back into my pocket and tried to forget about what happened this morning. 

I didn’t check the app again until around 2pm. I felt my phone vibrating so I checked it and saw a notification from “Life is Beta”. It said “New Experience” next to the logo; I didn’t want to but I clicked on the box in case it was trying to warn me again.  

When I opened up the app I saw an animated version of my manager typing on his laptop. The view shifted to where I was looking at my manager’s laptop. 

On his screen was a lady holding up a man by his hair. I could see what my manager was typing out. “Use your fingers to dig his eyeballs out.” 

The woman held up 3 fingers on her other hand and my manager went back to typing. “300 hundred for that? You’re fucking nuts. $200 and we have a deal.”

She nodded her head and using her index finger and thumb started to dig out the man’s left eyeball. 

I clicked on the home button before I saw anything else, but once I closed out of the app I got another notification. It simply said “Call 911.”

I ran to the restroom after I dialed 911 and explained to the dispatcher about what my manager was dong on his laptop. I requested that I stay anonymous and hung up the phone.

Fifteen minutes later my manager was taken out of his office by two police officers. He was pleading with them and telling them it was all a misunderstanding, but we could hear the sounds of a man yelling out in pain from our manager’s laptop. 

That was the last notification I received today, but I will let you know if I receive anymore. 

Stay safe everyone, and be careful with [who you trust] (https://www.facebook.com/HayongNoSleep/).

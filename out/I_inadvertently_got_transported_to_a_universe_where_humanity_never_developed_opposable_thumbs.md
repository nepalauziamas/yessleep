My great uncle would have been regarded as a bit of a crackpot as he was constantly inventing things that popped into his mind. Most of these items ended up in the trash days later as he would forget why he made them. 

Most of my family disowned him as they didn't want people to think they had any association with him. I on the other hand loved spending time at his house as there was always something interesting going on. He had made a substantial fortune in his younger days and so his house was full of things for me to occupy myself with.

I was heartbroken when I arrived at his house one day to find his corpse lying at the bottom of the stairs with a broken neck. Days later I discovered he had left everything he owned to me in his will. They caused strife in my family as people who hadn't spoken to him in 25 years, suddenly started coming out of the woodwork and demanding their share of his estate. They were not best pleased when I told them where they could stick their demands.

I was exploring his house not long after the funeral when I discovered a small long device which resembled a wand. It had almost a dozen buttons plastered around the sides of it. Me being the irresponsible idiot that I am, immediately pressed one of the buttons. I almost screamed as an intense pain exploded inside my head, and I collapsed to the ground before passing out.

I have no idea how long I was unconscious but I think it must have been a couple of hours. I awoke with a thumping headache and had to take a couple of deep breaths,  as my stomach was churning and the bile was rising in my throat.

I slowly pushed myself to my feet and froze in confusion as I realised I was no longer inside my uncle's home, but was somehow outside in a forest surrounded by trees that dwarfed any tree I had ever seen previously.

The wand I had pressed earlier lay a few feet away. I quickly picked it up and threw it in my pocket until I could figure out what was going on. There was no paths or clearings in view so I just started walking in a random direction.

I could hear animals and birds moving on all sides of me but none of them came close enough for me to get a good view of them. Everything around me seemed so serene and peaceful but the hairs on the back of my neck were sticking up for some reason.

A mewing noise drew my attention and I entered a clearing to discover a number of cats playing with each other. I thought they might run away but they didn't seem frightened by my presence at all. I slowly approached them and reached down and picked one up. My eyes were drawn to its teeth as they were very long and pointed. 

It took me a few seconds to notice that the clearing had gone deathly silent, and the cat I was holding was looking over my shoulder. My head turned inch by inch and I almost peed myself when I saw the giant feline a few feet away.

It was the size of a cow and had two razor sharp teeth jutting out of the side of its mouth. It opened its mouth and began emitting a growling noise, and its eyes were locked on mine. I stared in disbelief at what I knew was a saber tooth tiger, as they were meant to have been extinct for thousands of years.

I carefully placed what I assumed was its offspring on the ground and carefully began backing away. The tiger moved forward and licked the head of its young, as I turned and fled.

Within seconds I could hear its heavy footfalls as it gave chase. I knew that I was dead as this creature could easily rip me apart. I spotted what looked like another clearing up ahead and redoubled my efforts to reach it. 

I could feel the tiger's breath on the back of my neck as it got closer. I reached the gap in the trees and realised that I was at the edge of a cliff overlooking a river. I was debating what to do when I felt an agonising pain across my back and was flung over the cliff and into the river.

I desperately tried to stay afloat as the current pushed me along. I looked back to see the tiger standing at the top of the cliff gazing down at me. I reached behind me and felt the claw marks on my shoulder as the creature had given me a parting gift. The tiger disappeared from view as the river turned a bend. 

I tried to swim to the sides to try and escape but the current kept pushing me back into the centre. I was banged up against rocks that lined the river and soon my body was littered with bruises. 

The river slowly began to pick up speed and I realised too late that there was a waterfall up ahead. I grabbed onto a branch that was jutting out into the river and used it to pull myself towards the shore and safety. I had just about reached the bank when the branch snapped and I was thrown back into the river.

I braced myself as I was flung over the waterfall and hoped that somehow I would survive this. 

I awoke sometime later with my entire body feeling like it had been run over by a steamroller. I looked around me in wonder as I seemed to be lying on a bed in what looks like a makeshift hut. I gritted my teeth and managed to stand up and made my way outside.

I stood there gazing around with my mouth hanging open as people walked by without a second glance. By all appearances it looked like I was in a village that you might associate with some lost tribe in the amazon. Everyone was walking around with nothing covering their upper torso. I tried not to stare but my lower brain was making the decision for me. The villagers didn't even seem to notice my presence so I stood there silently for a few moments.

I finally got my libido in check and decided to find out what the hell was going on. I made my way towards someone who looked important as they were wearing some kind of cloak. I stopped in front of him and tried to think of a way we could communicate. My mouth hung agape when he started speaking to me in perfect English.

I eventually shook myself out of my daze and started telling him what had happened to me. He looked me up and down and was indifferent to my plight, but offered to help me none the less. I reached my hand to shake his hand and he shook it after a moment's hesitation.

Something felt wrong about the handshake and I looked down to see his thumb was in the wrong location. It was sticking up like the other fingers and couldn't bend like my thumb could. I turned my head and noticed that everyone in sight had the same affliction. The chief reached down and tried to pick up a stone and it was obvious that he couldn't pick it up properly.

The chief's head shot up as screams could be heard from outside the village. The villagers all ran towards the screams and I followed slowly behind and watched their fruitless attempts at trying to hold onto makeshift weapons which ended up falling out of their hands.

We quickly reached the perpetrator of the screams to find a pack of wolves circling a small girl, who lay soaked in blood and scratches as the wolves teased their prey. 

Some of the villagers ran towards the wolves and I watched in horror as the wolves lunged at them and ripped off pieces of their flesh. Within a minute a number of villagers lay dead on the ground, while the wolves feasted on their organs. 

I reacted without thinking and grabbed a stone and flung it at the nearest wolf. It let out a yelp as I managed to hit it in the eye. It turned towards me and began sprinting at me. I picked up a branch and placed it in front of me in the hopes of using it as a spear.

Time slowed down as the wolf jumped into the air, and I could see my death reflected in its eyes as it prepared to rip my throat out. I managed to raise the branch in time, and had utter satisfaction as the branch pierced the skull of the wolf. The wolf's body landed on top of me and I was pinned beneath its weight. 

I feared that the other wolves might finish me off but was relieved when some of the villagers helped remove the body of the wolf off me. The villagers had managed to fight off the rest of the wolves but over a dozen of them lay dead. The villagers turned around and headed home, leaving their dead to be eaten by whatever predator was nearby.

I was dead on my feet at this point and hobbled over to the nearest hut and threw myself onto the floor to get some much needed sleep. I lay there for a few minutes wondering what awaited me in the upcoming days, and how exactly I was meant to get home.

I was awoken by the sounds of pandemonium outside and I peered carefully out of the hut. I looked out at a scene of pure and utter carnage. The wolf pack from yesterday had returned and were now slaughtering anyone they could get close. The village chief lay on the ground just outside my hut with his throat ripped out. 

The village was littered with the dead and the dying. The wolves moved through the bodies and finished off anyone that was still twitching. I ducked my head back into my hut and grabbed my belongings.

I carefully began tearing a hole in the back of the hut, while listening out for any approaching wolves. I had managed to cut open a small hole when I heard the unmistakable sounds of footfalls coming towards the front of the hut.

I desperately began climbing through the hole as the wolves began to shove their way past my barricade. I had barely gotten out when a wolves head appeared in the hole and tried snapping at me. Thankfully it was too large to climb through and I turned around and fled.

I could hear howls behind me as the wolf pack finished decimating the village. My heart was thumping as I feared they would follow my scent and kill me as well. I began ducking and dodging and changing direction in the hopes of confusing any pursuit.

After hours of moving I reached a ridge that gave a panoramic view of a wide open wooded plain that stretched as far as the eye could see. The plain was shrouded in a hazy mist that made me think of graveyards.

I climbed down the ridge and started walking through the plain. I was running through the events of the last day and wasn't paying much attention to what was going on around me.

I was shaken out of my daydreaming after hearing a cracking noise under my feet. I lifted my foot and nearly toppled over when I discovered that I had stood on a human skull. I stepped backwards and heard another cracking noise. My body did a full 360 degree turn as I came to the sickening realisation that the ground was littered with the bones of hundreds of people. There was not a piece of skin or flesh on them as it looked like some animal had picked them clean

I began backing away in the hopes of getting away from whatever lived here. I felt something sticking to the back of my clothing and I reached back and tore it off. I took a closer look at it and was surprised to see it was a spider web.

My gaze shifted and I realised that what I had mistaken for a mist was actually a giant spider web that was spread across the wood. I spotted movement amongst the trees as dozens of spiders began climbing down the webbing.

They looked to be about the size of terriers and their bodies were covered in a corpse black fur. Their eyes were bright red and were fixated on me. I stood transfixed for a few moments as the reality of the trap I had walked in on began to dawn on me.

I finally started moving when one of them shot a piece of web at me and it landed on my arm. The burning sensation as the web tore through my flesh was the wake up call that I needed. I tore the webbing off my arm and began running. The spiders around me began shooting webbing at me and the ground soon looked like a silly string party. A number of the webs landed on me and I tore them off almost losing a number of fingers in the process.

I was thrown to the ground as something heavy landed on my shoulder. I rolled along and felt something squish underneath my weight. I pushed myself up and saw the remains of a spider lying on the ground. 

The ground shook beneath me as a thunderous noise forced me to cover my ears. One of the trees near me suddenly shot upwards and I looked upwards into the face of a spider the size of a two storey building. The smaller spiders were crawling all over it and I instantly knew that this was their mother. She stared down at me and her offspring that I had killed.

She raised one of her legs and I instinctively dived out of the way as it landed mere inches away from me. The mother let out a shrill cry and her offspring launched themselves at me. I took off running with the deafening sound of her footprints following close behind. Her offspring landed on me a couple of times but I was able to throw them off before they could harm me. 

I spotted a cave in the distance and used my last burst of energy to reach it. The mother used one of her legs to try and reach me and managed to cause a rockfall that blocked the entrance. I could hear her cries outside as she tried to smash her way inside. After a few failed attempts she gave up and I listened as her footsteps began to move away.

I lay there in utter darkness for a couple of minutes while waiting for my heart rate to return to normal. My eyes eventually adjusted to the darkness and I noticed a number of cave paintings lining the walls. I made my way over and was stunned as I discovered that the people who lived here worshipped the spiders and routinely gave them human sacrifices to appease them.

I felt a breeze coming from a corner of the cave and made my way towards it. I found a small hole that led towards what I hoped was freedom. I considered whether this was a bad idea but knew that I had no other choice in the matter. 

I reached the far end of the cave and stopped in wonder with my mouth hanging open. I finally remembered after almost a minute to take a breath, as I was just awe struck at the sight of a herd of woolly mammoths that wandered about on the clearing outside the cave.

They were such beautiful animals and I couldn't believe that such beauty was now extinct in my world. One of the mammoths made its way toward me and towered over me and seemed to be appraising me. It reached forward with its trunk and patted me on the head before moving away.

I noticed movement on the mammoths back and watched in horror as a giant black bug fell onto the floor nearby. It had what looked like a giant egg sack on its back which was blood red. It turned towards me and suddenly charged at me. 

I barely had time to react before I was pinned to the ground and the bug used its talons to begin tearing into my flesh. It opened its mouth and what looked like a second mouth shot outwards. The second mouth was covered in rows of teeth that looked razor sharp. The bug kept trying to use the second mouth to rip open my throat, but I kept dodging out of its way. 

I decided to be proactive and waited until its second mouth had once again missed me. I then turned my own head and began biting through the skin. My mouth was soon filled with a liquid that made me want to vomit, as it tasted that horrendous. The bug began screeching at the top of its lungs and its talons tore into my skin as it tried to eviscerate me. 

The weight on top of me suddenly vanished and I looked up to see one of the mammoths had grabbed the bug and thrown it to one side. It then crushed the creature with one of its giant feet. The mammoth made its way back towards me and I placed my hand out and rubbed its trunk to say thank you. It bowed its head at me slightly before moving away and I sat there watching as the herd disappeared from view.

My attention turned to my own body which was now riddled with open cuts and soaked in blood. I slowly stood up and heard something fall onto the ground behind me. I looked down to see the wand that had transported me here. I had stupidly forgotten about it with everything that had been going on. I spent a few minutes studying it before noticing a button marked home. I laughed to myself as I could have avoided all of this if I had simply looked at the damn device.

I pressed the button and practically wept when I reappeared in my uncle's home. I rushed downstairs to get a first aid to stitch my wounds. I stare down at the wand afterwards and wonder if it is a gift or a curse. I place it to one side while pondering what I should do with it. I pray that I make the right decision.

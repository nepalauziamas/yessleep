It was warm November night in 2019, I had just gotten into bed and had started to drift to sleep... 
My dream had started at a supermarket with a couple of friends. We were going through self check out when I noticed a man in a trench coat with a bucket hat behind us with no groceries. 

I had thought that this was a bit odd for someone to be in a trench coat and a hat when the sky is clear and it is warm but I just passed it by. We had gotten our groceries for my mom and were heading across the parking lot when I noticed the same man following us, almost ready to sprint towards us, so I whispered to my friends 

"we need to hurry don't ask just go"

I see the man start running towards us and I shriek "RUN"  so me and my friends are bolting to my mom's yellow Volkswagen Beetle (I don't know why I dreamt of that car specifically we don't even have one) we hopped in with the groceries and my mom asked 
"What's wrong? " as I was about to answer

The man jumped on the front of the car and me and my friends all yelled "DRIVE!! " as she turned the corner his trench coat flew open and his hat flew off 

I was in pure terror as I saw the butcher knife in an inner pocket of his coat but his face terrorized me the most 

His face was pale with a bright red nose his eyes, they had a red streak going down both of his eyes, his eyes also glowed an orange-red like a fire from hell in his soul, his teeth were like daggers with his menacing smile I knew who he was it was Pennywise. Then he dissapeared with out a trace

In my dream me and my friends decide the same day to go Christmas tree shopping, so we head to the Christmas tree lot. As we searched, I found a lovely ten foot pine tree but as I looked all around it I find a gap in the back and I was disappointed, but I looked inside and two red marks started to glow and a yellow dagger-like smile started to curve I was so much terror that I couldn't move for a minute enough time for a tear to fall down my face. 

When I could move a ran towards my friends not telling them what I had witnessed. 

Fast forward A few hours later (in my dream) we all decide to go to a nice thai Reausteraunt in town as we were enjoying our meal a women (who looked a little like Carole baskien thb) complemented me and my friends on how proper we were and she wanted to meet my parents (my dad wasn't in this so it was just my mom) so I decide to take her to my home to my mom

Now that we were home I was standing by a knife block in a corner the women was near the oven but still in front of me  and my sister was behind her 

As she was talking to me I noticed a filicker of red orange in her eyes and I knew exactly who "she" was 

As she was blabbering away about something I looked at my mom, who was leaning against the fridge, for reassurance and my mom slightly nodded to me. 

I look at my sister then down at my hand signaling to her that "on 3 you lift the oven grate ill do the rest" she nodded then I counted 1... 2... I yelled "3!! "

In mere seconds I grab the butcher knife and I turn on the burner with the women's throat in my hand. 

All of the sudden a calm voice came from the woman "sister, sister why are you doing this to me? " it was my sister voice, then she turned to ash. I look over at my sister and she opened her eyes they were orange and red and the smile began to curl

I said in shock "oh no"

And then I woke up

  

I should have known this was a terrible idea. Who finds, and takes, a job offer while casually browsing Reddit?

Yes, I realize I’m posting this story on Reddit right now. But this the only place I know I can reach people. I love the front page of the internet, but it’s no early 2000’s era Monster.com. It’s not a site to find a job. Unless it’s a job literally working for Reddit.. I don’t know. Look, I’m out of my mind right now. 

I messed up. I couldn’t keep it all straight. I .. just couldn’t do it. I don’t know how much time I have, but I have a nifty little setting that will post whatever I have written on the subreddit if I’m AFK for more than 2 minutes. I don’t know if I’ll live long enough to hit the “post,” button. So, I’ll type as much as I can. Sorry for any typos or information that doesn’t make sense.

My name doesn’t matter, you can call me B. I’m going to try to give just the facts ma’am. Again, forgive me if my words come out looking like the “conspiracy Charlie,” meme from Always Sunny.

I love all things media, radio specifically. Talk radio, more specifically. I remember as an early teen hearing Howard Stern and having my socks blown off by how wild his show was. As I grew into an older teen, around 18-19, I still appreciated the cheeky topics he and his crew discussed, but I started to understand the incredible talent he had for communication, and honesty. I think his movie displayed how he decided to be truthful to his audience, all the time. Even if it hurt. He also did write the movie, so.. well, take it for what it is. But I believe him.

I say all that to say I wanted to work in some kind of radio format. Sirius was just in its infancy (soon to be catapulted into the mainstream by Howard,) and the podcast era was also picking up steam. I didn’t want to be on the air, I wanted to produce or write. Do segments, research, things of that nature. I also loved scary stories, which had a great home on certain programs online and radio. This will come into play soon..

I got a half-ride scholarship to Central Michigan University to their communications program. Exactly what I was looking for. I don’t know how many programs I applied to, or how many my parents helped me apply for, but this was the one that took me. Never heard of the school, much less the state. Fire up chips, I guess.

Don’t mistake my lack of excitement for not appreciating what I received. I had a blast every day for four years. I was lucky enough to pair up with some great dudes. Not the party types, just like me. We drank and had fun, sure, but not in the dude bro way that so many campuses are full of. All three of us are still friends to this day. I hope no one has to tell them to come to my funeral.

After earning my bachelor’s degree in communications, I had the same question as nearly every college grad does. “Now what?” At the time this degree was as useful as a gender studies degree, KIDDING, kidding, don’t cancel me. I’m sure I’m way ahead of you on that one. Permanent cancellation.

I toiled away, working on my craft. What I lacked in experience I made up for with raw determination. I wanted to be the best at what I did, whatever that may be. I had a part-time gig producing some college radio shows while I was finishing my degree. Everyone in the field knows how un-remarkable these late-night shifts can be. I loved it though, gave me a chance to feel like I was the Baba Booey to whatever k-mart version of Howard Stern was spinning records on any given night 

I eventually moved on to some TV spots, production assistant jobs, and even working on a locally Emmy nominated nature show on PBS. It was a blast. After not winning, I fell into a slog. Throughout my early career in media, I never forgot my love of scary stories. I always loved programs on urban legends, movies about monsters, and reading supposedly true ghost encounters. At this time, about 2012 or so, I found the term “creepy pasta,” which was becoming all the rage on reddit and beyond. That’s what I wanted to do. Write, produce, and/or narrate these incredible stories about tall scary killers and pre-teen psychopaths.

I did a bit of work creating and producing YouTube videos for some early adapters of this medium. This failed to actually pay the bills though and I was forced to really “work,” for a living. I held down some menial delivery jobs, boring security shifts, and.. gulp.. telemarketing scams.

This is where the rando browsing of Reddit one night changed my life. I don’t know how I found myself on this subreddit. I was just there. I go through a lot of scary story/creepy pasta subreddits. I’m sure it was just on my recommended feed. The title hit me between the eyes like a sledgehammer.

***Want to earn money narrating creepypastas?***

Well, of course I do. There was no text in the preview, so I clicked on the title. The subreddit was called “EnigmaReads.”

From memory I’ll attempt to give you all the gist of what the post said. The original post is gone now, for reasons that may become obvious later. Stay tuned.

“*Hello, and welcome to Enigma Reads* (I’ll tell you this now that upon further investigation this subreddit did not have any other posts or interactions. I did not know this at the time.) *We are looking for exciting narrators to read spooky stories.* *They will range from all corners of the dark.* *Creepypastas, urban myth, true, and uncanny.*

*Is this something that interests you, scary gary?* *Well then let’s get started!* *There are just a few rules you must follow.* *These rules are non-negotiable.*  
 I knew this was coming. The dreaded “rules,” creepy pasta channels. I’ll give it a go..

*First rule.* *You MUST start recording at 1159 PM, whichever respective time zone you reside in.* 

*Second rule.* *Stories will be e-mailed to you.* *All stories will have a read receipt attached.* *You must acknowledge you have read the entire entry.* *Pay no attention to the address they are sent from.* *It will not be from the same email every time.*

*Rule three.* *Submit the recording to* [*Enigma123457890@enigmareads.nnet*](mailto:Enigma123457890@enigmareads.nnet) *with the story title in the subject line.*

Ok, that’s a little strange. Most “corporate,” emails are not that convoluted, and for sure don’t have a .net address.. with two “n’s.” I hate to say I recognized a small red flag raising, but damnit I was intrigued.

*Fourth Rule.* *Be sure to have one dozen red roses near you while narrating.* *They don’t have to be fresh cut per say but should be purchased the day of recording.*

What?

*Fifth Rule.* *If you hear a single or triple knock at the door at ANY time during your narration, stop recording immediately.* *Politely say “thank you,” and walk around your home for 2-5 minutes.* *It should be safe to resume narration soon after.* *Just make sure the roses are still alive.*  
 *Side note:* *Do not answer the door if/when you hear the three knocks.* *Also follow the same instructions if you hear a cat meow.*

*Number Six.* *Compensation will be mailed to a P.O. Box one week after the story has been submitted to EnigmaReads.* *If you are accepted, we will send it to a PO near the area you live in.*

*Rule Seven.* *If you find a yellow rose* (what the fuck is with the roses?) *in the PO box with your payment, expect another story submission to be emailed by the end of the business day.* *If you find a black rose, you must relocate.* *And never narrate again.*

Ok. Ok. I’m done. I shut my laptop screen down and shoved off my chair. I was more embarrassed than anything that I lasted that long into what was clearly a troll shit-post. How stupid. I was so blind to wanting a narration job, I ignored all the insane rules until the silliness factor hit 100 percent. I sat back and actually had a nice laugh to myself. Oh B, I said, you got got. That’s all man. Let’s put on some mindless Minecraft lets play to sooth your ego. Then I read Rule number eight.

*Rule number eight.* *Do not ignore this.* *We all live by the rules.* *You were meant for this.* *Follow the rules B.* *Have.. fun.*

Why did it say follow the rules “B?” My first name starts with the letter B. There’s no way that could be meant for me specifically. It could be a mistake. Or it could be meant for.. me.. I sent my application and pertinent information to the email address.

Four weeks later..

The clock face stares at me as I stare at it. 1158..11..59.. Record.

Only fifteen minutes later and I have finished the narration of my first story. I’ll have to go back and do some light editing, but right now I’m satisfied. It was a safe story about the main character traversing a weird, haunted house. The house starts speaking to him, he gets sucked in, makes mistakes, gets swallowed by the resident spirits. Not a story that would win any pea bodies, but still a well written story. It was the first one sent to me after I submitted my application. After four weeks I’d almost forgotten about the whole ordeal. I was happy to be “accepted,” to read a story.

After making some minor tweaks, I submitted it to the strange email. Guess there’s nothing left to do but go on with my life. I wasn’t afraid about following the rules. I followed them all as far as could tell.

*Dear participant.* *Thank you.* *Check PO box (redacted) for your payment.*  
 Nice. Once I grab the check, I will officially be a professional creepy pasta narrator. If you get paid for something, that makes you a professional. Small victory, hopefully the first of many.

I took an unfamiliar walk to my local Post Office. Unless you’re in the business of mailing out multiple packages weekly, or have an actual PO Box, the average person probably doesn’t visit the old American institution very often. I knew where it was of course, just by living here for a spell, but I don’t think I’ve set one solitary sandal there. My mail gets delivered to my home like most people.

I felt a little nostalgia wash over me like stepping outside in the early morning hours onto a white-sanded Florida beach. My mom used to bring me to the post office when I was a child. Not sure why we needed a PO box, we did have a regular mailbox outside our home. As kids you don’t ask silly questions like that. I haven’t felt the little satisfaction of having your own key that opens your own little package portal since then. 

Number 222. That’s the box that has been assigned to me. I’m not into numerology or anything but I do appreciate aesthetically pleasing patterns like this. Three of the same number repeated, lovely. As soon as my government-issued bronze key makes contact with the lock, I feel a rising panic. The rules. Shit. I forgot that I’m supposed to be looking for something beside the payment. I looked at my phone, hoping to have saved that reddit post. Why didn’t I save it? After I got my heart back down to maybe 160 from 190 BPM, I decided I had to either open it or just leave.

Here.. We.. go.

An envelope. No rose, no flower. I don’t think the rules said anything about not seeing any rose. I’m not sure, I wish I was sure. I shakily opened the envelope. It wasn’t sealed, just tucked in like you would do if you gave a birthday card to a friend. A small eggshell colored index card was inside. I saw green also, but I wanted to read what the card had to say.

*Enclosed is payment to (redacted) in the amount of $500 for story number one.* *Based on the agreed upon rate of ¢10 USD*  *for every word upon acceptance.* *Great working with you and hope we do it again soon.* *Ta-ta.* 

I.. craned my head toward the stained ceiling from the disco era and let out a generous belly laugh from my generous belly. This has been a goof! It’s real I mean, but it was just a cheeky game, like all internet shit now. There are no roses or knocks or witches or black cats. You know what, I appreciate the theatre. Oh man my journal will love this post. And I got a cool five hundo for the story. Come to think of it though.. I don’t remember the “agreed upon,” rate. This seems above standard but, well.. I’ll take it. Hopefully I can do it again.

Sliding into my home on a high as a “professional narrator,” I threw my keys on the table, opened my fridge, and poured myself a two finger Black Velvet Whisky. Nothing but the best 2nd shelf liquor to celebrate my entry into the world of creepypastas.

As fast as I downed the brown liquid, I dropped the (thankfully,) plastic cup onto the ground, spilling ice everywhere. A solitary yellow rose was on my dining room table.

A note accompanied the rose, rubber-banded around the stem. Written in crayon. Disturbing.

*We should have mentioned that the rules are somewhat fluid.* *The rose could be anywhere, not just in the PO box.* *Sometimes our benefactors want them inside of the home.* *Don’t fret.* *Nothing was touched and we locked up after words.* *Great story, check your e-mail for the next one.*

My head was spinning, not helped by the generous helping of Canadian Whisky I just downed. I have to sit down. What just happened? Someone was in my fucking house! I have to.. I have.. I need… I need another drink.

After one or seven more drinks, I stayed focused on the most beautiful, fullest rose I’ve ever seen. Yellow or otherwise. \*Ding.\* I picked my phone up from its face down position beside me on the couch.

 Subject: New Story

I read the synopsis of the story with glazed eyes. A generic rip-off of a slenderman style story. Kids go missing in a summer camp, creepy tall guy sighted, blah blah blah. I hunched forward, head in hands. How can I get over the fact that someone or something was in my home? I didn’t feel like I was in danger, but I didn’t like what was happening either. I did get a very real five hundred dollars though. I’m on my way to buy a dozen red roses.

I am again eyeing the blazing red numbers of my digital clock. 11:59. Trance-like I start to pound away on the keyboard. Making notes, recording and re-recording. Before I know it, it’s almost 5 AM. It’s.. a masterpiece. As far as throw away rip-off creepypasta stories go. I’m not ashamed. Submit.

I’m proud to say that a couple months later I am starting to make a comfortable living pumping out narrations to all corners of the web. I see them on YouTube, Spotify, and I’m even voicing a series for television. I couldn’t be happier. Finally, being recognized for my talent is a feeling I can’t put into words, despite being a professional now. No black roses, no more creepy rules popping up. I’m in a sublime state. I check my email to see another story. This one is right in my wheelhouse. Writer is working late, hears strange noises, writer descents into madness. I get right to work. I didn’t even look at the clock.

This one kind of got away from me, in a good way. I don’t go beyond 5,000-6000 words often. In fact, it is an absolute rarity. After I snapped out of my writing trance, I realized I should start to edit this beast down. \*KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK\*   
 I almost jumped out of my skin. Thankfully my writing fuel (whisky,) was not present in my highball, otherwise that would be either all over me or all over my computer.

My poor heart starts to race. This is one of the rules, but I can’t remember what I’m supposed to do. Damnit, what do I do? I hastily ran to the kitchen, where I scratched out the rules on my dry-erase board. In my inebriated state I could barely make out rule #5: *“If a single or triple knock occurs at ANY time, stop writing immediately.* *Say “Thank you,” and remain calm.”* Shit, thank goodness I was in some kind of sober mindset to write that out. “Thank you,” I said, sheepishly into the ether. No response, of course. I looked left, I looked right, and.. nothing. No specters, no demons. Good thing I’ve been following the rules. Silly to think these are actually real, but what’s been working has been working so I’m not going to chance it now. I plan on making my retirement on this gig.

I wake up in pain. Not unfamiliar pain. Self-induced. I’ll recover, I always do. Thankfully it’s an amazing 90 degrees out. Perfect for recovering from the night before, at least for me. I’ll commence my hangover ritual. Take a walk, sweat it out, get some caffeine, and destroy something greasy. Preferably a Carl’s Jr. burger. And that’s what I did. And wouldn’t you know it, I was feeling back to normal by the time I reached the Post Office. PO Box 222. This one will be a nice payday, that last story I submitted was well over 10,000 words. 

As I opened the box I saw.. black. No light, and certainly no envelope containing cash or check. I had to shake my head and try to come back to reality. I’m feeling ok, but still hungover. I must not be seeing this right. I wasn’t. I saw black because there was the largest black rose facing me that anyone had ever seen. I don’t even know if this was truly a rose. The petals were at least double the size of a normal rose. For some dumb reason I leaned in.. I smelled it. It smelled.. great. It was real. The well-known phrase entered my mind. Stop and smell the roses. At that moment I understood. I didn’t understand. But I understood. Enjoy what you have. Be a good person. Fuck, I wish I was a better person. Wasting my life writing silly stories and not enjoying loved ones. Not enjoying everything. Not enjoying anything. There was a tiny note underneath the black rose. As I grabbed the rose, I felt a slight sting in my left hand. Warmth fills me. Liquid pain.

Beneath the blood stains I could unfortunately read what the note said. “*Follow the Rules.”*

My skin turned ice cold. My brain shifted into 7th gear. I followed every rule. I put forth an honest effort, I wasn’t trying to deceive anyone or anything. I was starting to get hyper.  Tears were effortlessly falling from my eyes. At this point I knew the final chapter was being written in front of me. Can’t I just leave though, wasn’t that one of the rules? Or is it too late.. I still.. I still don’t understand. 

“I said thank you! I stopped! What.. what else do you maniacs want??!”

My visceral caveman pleas were met by no reply. I was embarrassed to have lost my composure like that. I painfully straightened up, squared my shoulders, and lifted my chin up. I’m going to walk home. I’m going to walk home and accept whatever is waiting for me like a man.

I wasn’t even fazed when I saw my door was ajar. I hit record on my phone. I hope this all transcribes to my on-going post..

I threw my keys on the table. I took one step towards the drawer above the sink, where I keep my liquor. But stopped. For once I won’t have to imbibe to hide my pain. I’m ready to take it. I instead filled a dirty cup in the sink with fresh, cool water. After a generous drink, I spoke to whatever was behind me.

“Why?”

*“Sometimes good things happen to bad people.* *Sometimes bad things happen to good people.* *Some rules are made to be broken.* *Most are made to follow.* *You will be remembered though.* *Not many can say that…….”*

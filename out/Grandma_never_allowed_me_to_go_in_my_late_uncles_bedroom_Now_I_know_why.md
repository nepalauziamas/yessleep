I’m still crying when I get into grandma house. “I know that’s hard honey” says mom, hugging me “but you can keep whatever you want, all grandma’s stuff”. I wipe away my tears. I know grandma wouldn’t like to see me so sad. 
“So, you go upstairs and I’ll clean here. I’ll put everything in a box, so, you can take a look when you’re done.” Mom suggests and I nod. 

I go up the stairs and I arrive to the two opposite doors. I know I should go in my grandma’s bedroom, but I can’t stop looking the other door. It was my late uncle’s bedroom, and my grandma never allowed me to go in. I suppose that it was too painful for her to see that room open with someone else in it. I’ll sneak out just for a couple of minutes, I’m too curious. Mom won’t even notice.

As I open the door, the smell of mould and dust hits me. It must be closed since my uncle passed away 25 years ago. On the wall there are some fading bands’ posters and a Jamaican flag. Grandma used to say that Jamaica was my uncle’s dream. I open the closet and I look some beautiful ‘90 clothes. It’s such a waste! Maybe I could ask mom if I can keep some of them.  In the down corner i even find a box with some cool accessories. I start to took  everything out: 2 belts, a pair of sunglasses, a backpack. But the thing that make my eyes shine with excitement is on the bottom of the box: an old game boy. I’ve always wanted one, but grandma always said mom to never buy me those games, that a child should play outside.

I turn it on, thinking it won’t work after all this time, but surprisingly, the low quality graphic appears. I turn it up down, trying to understand what game is in it. “Descent into hell”. That’s weird, I’ve never heard of this game. I look back to the screen. The graphic shows some stairs and there’s a question: “do you want to start a new game?” And under that there are the two options: “yes” or “no”. I press “yes”
The stairs begin to move
A man with half face ripped off starts to speak “hi, welcome into the hell. Everything here is horrible and scary. Enjoy your journey.” I press “ok” and the games shows some people running from left to right and from right to left. Then it shows a boat and a men on it. 
“Hi, I’m Charon. You need me to get to the other side. But your ride won’t be free. You have to give me something.” Again, two options “ok” and “I’ll stay here” I press “ok” and the screen shows the other side of the river getting closer and closer. Then it shows a men with horns and a tail. I guess it’s the devil. “Hi, congratulation, you’ve reached the hell.”

The game boy turns off. I throw it on the bed. This game sucks. I can’t believe I’ve wasted time with it. Now it’s better that I go to work. I get up and I go to the door. It’s stuck. I start to knocking the door very hard. Shouting “MOM I’M STUCK HERE” hoping she will hear me. After a couple of minutes I hear her voice behind the door “Honey? What are you doing there?” She asks concerned. “Yeah mom, I’m sorry, I just wanted to give a look to this room. I won’t do it again, please get me out of here” she tries to open the door, but nothing. “It seems that the door lock is stuck. Let me see if I can find some oil” “ok” I say while I hear her walking away. After 10 minutes I hear her again. “Honey I’ve found it” and I hear the spray noise. The door finally opens, but what’s behind the door isn’t my grandma’s house. It’s just an enormous dark space, with people without an arm, a leg or the skin screaming in pain. Horrified I look to the man with half face ripped off from the game, who I believed was my mom a couple of minutes ago. “Enjoy your stay”

I found this diary of a psychiatrist in the hold library by my home. This is what it read...

*Wednesday 23-04-2037(day before month)*

*I was assigned a new patient today, his name is Chester Crane. I was warned before I went to see him that he is a dangerous man. So I prepared myself just incase. When i went in i was expecting an old man with wrinkles and grey hair. But he was only 35. I went on with the session.*

*Me: Hi im Danni, whats bothering you today? i asked, hoping he would give me a solid response.*

*Chester: I keep seeing her, she is mad at me but i saved her*

*Me: Who are you seeing?*

*Chester: Melody!*

*Me: Why is she mad at you Chester?*

*Chester: Because I hid her body in the woods, I tried to save her in the only way i knew how.*

*Me: what do you mean save her? what were you saving her from?*

*Chester: from the man in red, he wanted her soul, so i saved her.*

*I was really scared after this, i kept on asking him questions but he ended up freaking out and went into an episode. I called the nurses in and left them to deal with him while i evaluated our session.*

*I had another session with chester today, he is starting to come out of his shell a bit more. He wasnt that pleased to see me which i understood but i need to find out who the man in red is. I need to find out why he killed her and refers to it as 'saving' her. I need to find out whats going on in his head. I did notice one thing today. I felt quite off, dizzy almost. I kept zoning out as if i was drained but i was perfectly energized. He didnt tell me anything other than how his dinner was lastnight and how Melody didnt visit him. He seemed almost sad that she didnt visit him. But he also seems scared of her at the same time. I dont know what to do with him, but i will find out who the man in red is if its the last thing i do.*

*Something really weird happened with Chester today. I was getting ready to go in for our third session when all of a sudden loud, terrible screams came from his room. I heard a bunch of footsteps quickly pass my office door. I ran after them curious as to what happened and he was covered in blood. But it wasnt his own. It was a nurse. I was threw up at the sight of the blood splattered everywhere. Im curious how he even got the chance to get close enough to the nurse to hurt her. How did he even tear her up like that? It was horrific. My session was cancelled but i have another session wednesday. Ill ask about the man in red then.*

*I got an answer and i now regret ever asking. The man in red is a pale creature, bony and skinny, big black holes for eyes and sharp claws. The reason its called the man in red is because each time he kills, he covers himeself in his victims blood. Melody was a waiter at chesters favourite cafe, and he gained an obsession towards her. Only Chester can see the man in red so only he knows who the victims are. Chester was telling me about the man in red and how he knows who the next victim is. I asked him who it was and he slowly lifted his head up and said "you are danni". My spine shivered as i heard my name roll off his tongue.*

*Im currently hiding in my closet as i write this, the man in red is here and he isnt happy. Hes dripping blood through my house, his wet feet tapping on my wooden floors. He is smashing paintings and pictures. I think he can smell me. Im really scared. I cant do anything but hide and hope for him to dissapear. i hope he leaves soon.*

*Its been 5 minutes and hes now in my room, hes growling and drooling. I think im about to die. Im peaking through the crack in the doors. I made eye contact with him. To whoever reads this...speak to Chester Cra...*

Things haven't been going well at work since the incident at Century Manor.  I‘ve been transferred from my post on patrol duty and been reassigned to the access-control booth for one of the maximum security wings.   I was told to sit in a glass box, about 15ft by 8ft, and push buttons which engage and disengage magnetic locks, opening doors and allowing access to the unit.  The dozens of monitors in front of me show staff coming and going, looking up impatiently at the camera, waiting for me to hit 5, then 4, then 3 which unlock the corresponding doors.  There are five thick steel doors to get through the entrance.  To get through each door, the previous one has to be properly closed first.  They never close right so people get stuck, then give impatient looks to the camera.  I have to smile politely and say, “Check the door behind you, I don't think it closed properly,” into my decades-old intercom system.  I’m locked in to my booth so all I can do is watch as they struggle to comprehend my garbled instructions. 

The staff on the unit were nice enough at first, saying “hi" and “good morning" as they’d come in for their shifts.  I’d smile back and wave and buzz them through the doors.  But it was only hours before I had become a background fixture in my booth and people would walk through the doors and past without even glancing at me, expecting the doors to open as if by magic.  Doctors and nurses pass through, chins in the air, ignoring my desperate attempts at pleasant conversation and rapport-building.  What can I say, I have a complex.  I really need people to like me.  It’s a sickness.  

Still, I didn't mind it at first.  I was locked in the most secure part of the hospital so I felt totally safe, at least.  Doug was still on the loose and the police were in his back pocket, as was Philip, my supervisor.  Although Doug no longer worked in the hospital, I knew he wasn't far away.  For all I knew he and his demented daughter lived beneath the hospital in an undiscovered tunnel system somewhere.  Why else would Samantha have called that room in the old manor their “clubhouse”?  I shuddered thinking back to the bloodbath in the basement.  And how else could they have disappeared with all the exits covered?  I wasn’t about to venture back into Century Manor any time soon, though, that was for sure.  I didn’t trust those buckled and sagging ceilings, and I definitely didn’t like the memories I had of the place.  

I couldn't always hide in my booth, though, as we would switch out with one patrol officer each day for a couple hours to do a quick patrol and take a half hour lunch break.  I enjoyed getting out in the fresh air, but the indoor parts of my patrol were difficult and filled me with anxiety.  The grounds never ceased to surprise me, as I would discover a new section almost every day.  The place was labyrinthine.  I was always scared now, walking in the basement.  I would hear steps coming from a distance and my mouth would go dry, my legs would stop working, and I’d have to force myself to move forward.  I knew Doug wanted me dead.  I was the only one who knew his secret.  

Thank God I have no address or personal information listed online.  No way for the two of them to find me.  Still, last night I could have swore I'd heard the high and melodious laugh of a familiar little girl from just outside my apartment, down below on the street level.  I looked outside and seen no one there.  It was unnerving to say the least. 

One happy accident that came of my reassignment to the control booth outside E-3 was that it had led to the discovery of a way to the sub-basement!  I had already searched the mechanical section in the basement that had been my first hunch, but found the stairs led down to a new section of isolated mechanical rooms, full of a lot of machinery but nothing else.  No tunnels, no secret passages either, at least it looked that way to me.  The fresh cinderblock walls had no visible gaps or irregularities.

Yesterday in the control booth, however, I had called the repairman to investigate a noise.  It had been coming from an area up a ladder and through a hatch in the ceiling of the control room.  I had peaked up there and seen the area was vast and noticed an old steel-cage elevator which looked almost 100 years old or more.  Another relic that had been left to decay in the hospital, like the electro-shock therapy room where I had first met Samantha.  That gave me an idea.  Maybe that old elevator accessed areas no longer accessible by stairs or the more modern elevators in the building. It was worth a shot. 

I asked the repair guy about it and he shrugged, saying it wasn’t working and had been locked up for as long as he could remember with a padlock and chain.  I resolved to get in there somehow.  An opportunity presented itself quickly enough when Matt, the new guard, came to relieve me for a break. He had already been entrusted with the big key ring and passed it off to me so I could get where I needed to go on my break.  I had a flash of inspiration - I told him I was going up to the roof for a smoke, even though I’m not a smoker, he didn't know that.  He just passed me the keys and said to have a good break. 

I climbed up the ladder and found the key for the rusty padlock after trying a dozen different ones.  I opened up the lock and unwound the heavy chain from the outside of the elevator which held it closed.  With a large flat head screwdriver that a repairman had left I managed to pry open the doors slightly. It took all of my effort, they were heavy and rusted, almost seized, but I managed to pull them open all the way.

I took a deep breath and got in.  The lever to the left of the door was ancient, pitted and rusting, but had an additional level on it that I had never seen in the other elevators in the building.  Below B1 was B2, a sub-basement, just as I had suspected.  The legendary underground tunnels of The Sanitarium, source of the haunted stories which were passed off around town as myths and urban legends. 

I hesitated for a minute.  I wasn’t just curious to see what was down there – I needed to see what was down there. But my arm wouldn't pull the lever.  The deep-down lizard part of my brain was telling me to leave, to run, and to never come back to this place.  I found myself walking out of the elevator, but then against my better judgement, and all rational common sense, ignored my fears and got back in. I had to see what was down there for myself.   

I pulled the dingy bronze lever downwards, decades of thick spider webs stretched and tore as they came with it.  The steel cage shook and heaved, sending me off balance into the steel bars behind me.  With an alarming squeal it began to descend.  Gradually the sound faded and the car shook and rattled its way down.  I could see out through the steel bars as I dropped down into the darkness.  I pulled out my flashlight and turned it on. 

After a minute the car stopped and I let out my breath.  As I inhaled, I immediately regretted going down there.  The smell was horrible, like the smell in the basement of Century Manor, but worse.  Like decayed and rotting flesh, left out for months or years, even.  I pulled my shirt up over my nose, but that made little difference.  

I willed myself forward and found flies were buzzing and swarming all around me.  There were hundreds of them, thousands of them.  No wonder the hospital always had an insect problem!  The cafeteria was always swarming with big, nasty flies, landing on your food and buzzing around your head while you ate.  Patients would always complain about them, saying they would come out of the vents.  I had chalked it up to delusion.

As I walked forward I realized I had not come prepared for this.  I needed a gas mask, or a respirator.  I felt like I couldn’t breathe, especially not with the flies buzzing around my head and flying up my nose and into my mouth.  I felt like I was close, though.  If I could get some proof, I could show that I wasn’t crazy, that Doug had killed Rhonda, the records-keeper, and Sam, the patient.  I wondered how many other patients who had absconded and never come back were really victims of him and his psychopath daughter.  They had probably hidden numerous bodies down here, which accounted for the smell.

My flashlight beam hit something unusual on the wall and I stopped for a moment to look.  Someone had carved their initials into the wall with a knife.  “D.L. + M. B. 4EVER” was encircled by a heart.  Weird.  Wasn’t Doug’s last name Lambert?  Could D.L. be Doug Lambert?  And if so, who was M.B.?  

I continued on and saw up ahead was a split in the tunnel.  It went three different ways, each direction looked like it went on for a long, long ways.  I checked my phone.  I had already been gone for half an hour!  Where had time gone?  My break was already over.  I would have to come back when I had more time.  I took the key for the elevator lock off the key chain, and put it into my pocket.  

I turned around and walked back to the elevator car.  When I got there my heart stopped in my chest.  Standing in the elevator car, was Samantha.  How had she made it past me?  She smiled at me deviously and pulled the lever.  The car began to rise, leaving me in the lightless tunnels below the hospital.  She giggled as the elevator rose up and out of sight, and she disappeared from view.  

As if on cue, the light from my flashlight began to flicker and I realized with dismay it was due for a battery-change.  How stupid, to come down here on a whim, not even planning enough to bring back-up batteries for my only flashlight.  If I died down there, I thought, I would deserve it for my lack of preparation.  My childhood Boy Scout leader would be so disappointed if he could see me now.  

I could hope that Matt would send someone down to look for me, but Samantha had probably gone up and locked the elevator again so that it looked the same as always.  There was no way to call the elevator from down here, either, it appeared.  The whole thing was operated from inside the box.  No one knew I was down there, so no one would come looking for me.  

The walkie-talkie had no reception, as per usual.  My cell phone had no bars and said “Service Interruption” at the top.  My only choice was to walk forward and look for another exit.  I made my way back to the intersection and decided to head right, thinking that would take me underneath E wing, where maybe there was a ladder or something I could use to climb out.  I would have to take my chances and hope this wouldn’t lead me to a booby-trap set by Doug.  I had a feeling he was expecting me, somehow.  

I continued along, trying to ignore the mice and rats that I began to notice scurrying around here and there.  Didn’t notice those before, I thought.  My flashlight flickered off again and I almost had a panic attack when it went out for a few seconds, leaving me in total darkness.  I shook it and it refused to come back on.  I shook it again, banging it against my palm, hard enough to leave a mark.  It came back on reluctantly, dimly.  I let out a shaky breath and continued forward.

I heard a noise from behind me and spun around, only to see a big rat noisily chewing on something.  It made a crunching noise.  I shone my flashlight at it and it scampered away, but I caught a glimpse of the dehydrated finger in its mouth, covered in old blood and bite marks.  I shuddered and picked up my pace.  

I kept walking and eventually saw what I was looking for.  A ladder leading up to a hatch in the ceiling.  I climbed it quickly and turned the handle, pushing up.  It wouldn’t budge.  I had another moment of sheer panic when I thought, there could be a fridge on top of this hatch, for all you know.  They might have retiled the floor right over top, sealing you in here forever.  What did you think was going to happen, you’re obviously going to die down here and be eaten by rats, mice, bugs, and Doug.

I forced my shoulder into the hatch with all my might and it budged an inch.  I pushed again the same way and managed to get it up high enough to squeeze my arm and shoulder out.  I wiggled and squirmed out through the small gap I had made and managed to pull myself out onto the basement floor.  I lay there, defeated.  How could I ever bring myself to go back down there?  

Well, I can tell you right now, I’ve resolved to do it.  Maybe those of you in the “comments” section who say I’m crazy are right, maybe I am.  I must be to go back down there.  But, strangely I feel like I can’t stay away.  It’s like an itch that needs to be scratched, even though you know it will only spread the poison.  

The headaches are back now.  I know this sounds odd, but the darkness in those tunnels would be kind of soothing, now that I think back.  When you have a migraine, there’s nothing better than lying in a dark room and closing your eyes, and down there is about as dark as it gets.  I have to figure out a way to get down there, and stay down there for longer, so I can explore it properly.  The key is in my pocket, all I have to do is get back to that elevator when no one is watching.  I’m sure it’s dangerous, but I can’t.. I can’t..  Sorry, I couldn’t remember for a second why I was even doing all this.  That’s right – for Rhonda!  I have to show people it was Doug who killed her.  My mind is a bit fuzzy right now, maybe it’s lack of sleep.  I’ll get some rest, then figure out a plan to get down there when no one is watching.

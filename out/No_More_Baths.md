Splish splash, I was taking a bath… and what a horrible idea that was. 

I know bath-time isn’t the manliest, but sometimes I enjoy a good rub-a-dub-dub in the tub. It relaxes me. Helps me unwind. Sure, the rose petals might be a bit much, but they look nice floating on top of the water. Really compliments my loneliness. The candles too, I suppose. 

Look, it’s not an everyday thing, okay?

Anyways, there I was, naked and wet as the day I was born, nearing an hour in the tub, when all of a sudden, I heard something fall into the water. It wasn’t a large splash, just a quick bloop. Similar to a bar of soap slipping into the bath water, or well, forgive me for this, but the comparison is too spot on to ignore… a turd dropping into a toilet. 

My eyes shot open and I quickly parted the petals in search of whatever had just joined me, but after a solid minute, I came up empty-handed. So, I laid my head back, closed my eyes, and drifted back to my happy place, and then… *bloop.*

“Okay, what the fuck?” I said aloud, then stood up, kicking around in the water. 

Again, I found nothing.

I shook my head and sighed, “Whatever,” and stepped out of the bath, grabbed a towel, and began drying off. My romantic evening for one had reached its conclusion, whether I liked it or not. I didn’t know what the source of the sound was. Probably nothing, I thought. But, regardless, the mood had been killed by the bloop and enough was enough. Plus, my skin was all pruney from having been in the water too long.

Before draining the tub, I stepped to the mirror and took a look at myself. “Yeesh,” I grimaced. “Go to the gym once in a while.” Then, I noticed in the corner of the mirror the reflection of something extending up from the middle of the tub, and when I focused in on it, saw a dark, decrepit old arm with something in its hand, raising upwards. Then it stopped, opened its hand, and dropped whatever it was holding.

*Bloop.*

I gasped and stumbled backward into the door, my towel dropped to my ankles. No time to cover up. I twisted on the doorknob, and yes, despite living alone, I do still shut my bathroom door. After all, how embarrassing would it be for an intruder to sneak up to my bathroom and see a lonely, bearded bear of a man bathing in a tub full of rose petals? Or worse, what if my mom stopped by unannounced and used the spare key I gave her? She’d surely tell Dad, and then what? We’d never make eye contact again. 

But this? An intruder coming from the tub itself? Who could’ve anticipated that? 

So, I twisted the doorknob and burst into the hall, colliding with the wall, knocking over framed photos, and then took off toward the front of the house. I reached the front-door and was about to leave, when it hit me. If I go running outside naked, crying to neighbors about the intruder in the tub, who I could only assume made its way in there via the tiny drain, they’re going to think I’m insane. They’ll call the cops, who will then call an ambulance, who will then take me to a hospital, sedate me, and then next thing I know I’m sitting in a wheelchair in a mental asylum, drooling on myself. 

Fuck that. I ain’t spending time with no Nurse Ratchet.

So, step one was to put on some clothes. Only problem is I had to pass the bathroom to get to my bedroom where my clothes are at.

“Dammit,” I sighed, then crept into the kitchen and grabbed a knife. Then I stepped to the end of the hall and yelled, “I’m calling the cops!”

That was a lie. My phone was in the bathroom, and I don’t have a landline, because who does anymore? I quickly became concerned the intruder knew I was lying, so I added, “I’ll fuck you up!” But it came out all shaky and scared and not the least bit convincing.

As I stood at the end of the hall, waiting for a response, I began to think that maybe there wasn’t anybody in the bathroom after all and what I saw was just a figment of my imagination. Perhaps I’d spent just a little too long in the bath. And the more I thought about it, the more it made sense. 

“Ah,” I laughed. “I’m just crazy, that’s all.” 

My shoulders began to relax. My heart rate slowed. My hands stopped shaking. But, as I crept back to the bathroom, I kept my guard up. Just in case. 

When I reached the doorway, I stopped, inhaled, and then swung into the bathroom with the knife firmly gripped and in front of me.

Nothing.

I let out a sigh of relief and shook my head, then stepped toward the tub and at that precise moment, a rotting corpse of a woman covered in what can best be described as black drain grime, slowly rose from the tub, her body contorting, bones and joints popping and cracking. Her long hair was matted with the same grime she was covered in, and as her contorting neared its conclusion, she stood facing me, her neck bent and her head resting to the side, against her shoulder. There were hollow pits where her eyes should be and beneath them a lack of both nose and lips. She was almost skeletal, but not quite. The flesh which remained was rotten, most apparent on her arms, from which some flesh dangled loosely. Her hands, equally rotten and filthy and with exposed muscle and ligaments, were balled into fists. 

As I stood speechless, frozen in sheer terror, unable to scream or move, the woman contorted a final time, snapping her head upright and opening her hands, and from them, she dropped two rotten eyeballs, which both landed in the tub with a familiar…

*Bloop.*

She lunged out of the tub towards me and I stumbled backward and back up the hall. Behind me, I could hear the wet thump of her rapidly moving feet. 

“Shit, shit, shit,” I cried, then with a particularly loud “SHIT!” I spun around and threw the knife at her. However, my hopes of the blade stabbing into her head and her coming to a sudden halt were met with disappointment even though the blade did in fact stab into the center of her skull, but by no means did she slow down. I think she sped up. 

Subsequently, so did I.

I burst out the front door completely nude and unashamed and took off down the road as fast as possible, legs moving faster than I ever thought capable. And my arms I had going Tom Cruise style. You know, open-handed karate chops. Say what you will, but I think it made me faster.

I ran a solid mile or two before I found a cop and leaped onto the hood of his car, screaming, “Save me! Oh my god, save me!”

He got out, taser in hand, yelling for me to get off the hood. I did as he asked and pleaded for him to get me out of there.

“Calm down,” he commanded. “What’s the matter?”

“There’s a fucking…” I stopped to catch my breath, pointing down the road as I did so. “There’s a…”

“A what?”

“A fucking Drano witch!”

The cop was quiet for a moment, then said, “*A Drano witch?*”

“Or… like a… shit. I don’t know, man. She came from the drain, I think.”

“What drain?”

“My bathtub drain.”

“Your bathtub drain?”

“Jesus Christ. Yes. You know, the tiny little drain no human should be able to fit through. That one. It’s the only explanation that makes sense.”

“Right.” The cop said something into his radio, then said, “How about you have a seat in the back of my car?”

“Oh, thank you so much.”

He walked me over and sat me in the backseat, and I said, “Lock the doors, please.”

“They will be.”

“And also, can we just go ahead and leave?”

“Just a minute.”

“Look, man. I don’t want her to catch up. She was chasing me.”

“I’m going to have EMS come check you out.”

“Oh.” Then I looked down at my nude waist and said, “Oh no. No! Wait, I’m not crazy. I know I sound crazy. Hell, even I thought I was crazy for a minute, but I swear, I’m not.”

“Okay, okay. Calm down. They’re just going to check you out.”

“For the love of God, please. I don’t want to end up in an asylum.”

The cop shut the door as another police car arrived, blue lights flashing. He walked over to the other officer’s car and said something, nodded toward me, and the two of them laughed.

“Goddammit,” I sighed.

They spoke for another minute then the two of them walked back toward me and I thought, okay, I’m just going to lie and tell them I took shrooms and had a bad trip. But, when they opened the door, the first cop asked, “Hey, are those rose petals stuck to you?”

I hadn’t realized it, but some rose petals must’ve gotten stuck to me as I was getting out of the bath. I looked away from the officer and quietly answered, “Yeah.”

“You were in the bath, right?”

I nodded.

“You live alone?”

I nodded again.

The cop snorted and shut the door again and the two of them burst into laughter.

I’m sure my face was as red as the rose petals then, and I looked up and loudly said, “I was high on shrooms. It’s not like I’m always bathing with rose petals. Guys…?”

They couldn’t hear me.

Right about that time, the ambulance arrived. “Great,” I muttered. 

As they were pulling up, their headlights illuminated a storm drain. At first, I didn’t notice, but as I sat in the back of the patrol car, staring out the windshield, coming to terms with my future in the nuthouse, I saw her. Just her rotting head. 

And then I truly did go nuts.

I remember only a few more things from that night. The cops and the medics holding me down as I tried to break free, them injecting me with a sedative, handcuffing me to the stretcher, and as the medics wheeled me past the storm drain and to the ambulance, just before I lost all consciousness, I heard from the sewer, one more…

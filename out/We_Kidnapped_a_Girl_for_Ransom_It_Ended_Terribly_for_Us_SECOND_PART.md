It was almost fully dark by the time we arrived at the cabin, and the interior was nearly pitch black. I felt around on the wall until I found a light switch and flipped it but nothing happened. "Shit, power's out," I said.

"There's a generator out back. Wait here a minute, I'll start it up," Mitch said, taking a penlight out of his jacket. He switched it on and went outside.

The three of us - me, Kenny and Wyatt - stood there in the dark for a few minutes with the girl between us, her hands bound behind her with Zip ties, a pillowcase covering her head. None of us said anything as we waited on Mitch. The only sound was the girl's uneven, frightened breathing.

Finally, I heard the faint rumble of a motor outside and an overhead lightbulb flickered, then came slowly to life, dim at first, then brightening.

We looked around the cabin. It wasn't much to see; one large front room that was a combination living room/kitchen with a narrow hallway in the rear that Mitch had told us led to a tiny bathroom and two bedrooms.

Mitch re-entered and shut the door behind him. "Okay, bring her over to the kitchen," he said.

We led the girl over and Mitch motioned for us to sit her down in a chair. He gestured us back, then scooted another chair across the floor until it was directly in front of her. He sat down to face her.

"You're Katrina, right?" he said.

"Y-yes, sir." she stammered fearfully.

"Mitch took a pack of Luckies out of his leather jacket and lit one with his Zippo. He took a drag, then looked thoughtfully at the cigarette. "You want a smoke, Katrina?" he offered.

"N-no thank you, sir." she replied with cautious politeness.

"Come on," he insisted slyly, "I know you smoke. And not just cigarettes."

Wyatt snickered at this and Mitch shot him a glare.

"Not anymore. I'm a decent person now. I've cleaned up my behavior," Katrina answered.

Mitch shrugged and pocketed his pack of smokes. "Have it your way. Look Katrina, I know you're scared, but we just want some money from your dad. He comes through, and we have no reason to hurt you. Or kill you. Once we get paid, you go free. Just don't do anything stupid in the meantime, like try to escape. You got that?"

"Yes sir," she said, nodding her head.

"You can call me Number One. My associates are Number Two, Number Three, and Number Four. You need something, like having to go to the bathroom, just ask one of us and we'll be happy to oblige. But..." His voice dropped, becoming low and slightly threatening. "*Don't make a single fucking move without asking us first, you understand?"*

She nodded her head frantically, terrified.

His tone softened. "Just sit there and keep quiet and I promise you'll be Okay. Hopefully your dad will pay up sooner rather than later. Then me and my buddies will be a whole lot richer and you'll be a whole lot safer. In a month we'll be chillin' on an island somewhere and you'll be back home with Daddy. We'll all be happy and this will just be a bad memory."

He stood up and turned to the three of us. "Okay, Number Three"--that was me--"you come with me. We're going into town to get some supplies. Number Two and Four, stay here and keep an eye on her. We'll be back in a couple hours."

I followed Mitch outside and we got into his Challenger. He started the engine and off we went.

\*\*\*\*\*

Mitch and I didn't talk much on the ride into town. The radio was on and we listened intently. News of the killings and the abduction had already broke. The State Police and the FBI had begun a manhunt and issued a nationwide Amber Alert. There was no mention of the kidnappers having contacted the girl's father and making a ransom demand...not yet, anyway. "So far, authorities have no leads," the newscaster said in finishing. Mitch nodded, seemingly satisfied.

We stopped at a small mom & pop grocery store and bought enough food to last us a few days, plus several cases of beer and a couple cartons of cigarettes. After we got back in the car, Mitch called The Russian and spoke to him briefly. There was no indication that the girl's father had started the money transfer, but it had only been a few hours and Mitch wasn't discouraged.

"Hey, Mitch," I said as he ended the call, "are we really going to let her go if her old man pays?"

Mitch was silent for a moment. "I gave her my promise, didn't I?" he replied without looking at me...which really wasn't the same thing as an answer. He lit another cigarette then started the engine and we headed back to the cabin.

A cold, late-fall moon was climbing the night sky. It was full and seemed unusually luminescent, casting an eerie, bluish lunar glow over the countryside as we drove.

We made a bad mistake, a terrible mistake, leaving that nutjob Wyatt in the cabin with the girl while we were out. We should have known better, but the only excuse I can think of is we were both still pretty rattled by the brutality of the botched kidnapping and weren't thinking clearly. Maybe Mitch reasoned that Wyatt wouldn't dare try anything with Kenny there to keep him in line...but Kenny was too soft and Wyatt was a lunatic.

We heard the screams coming from the cabin as we pulled to a stop outside, somewhat muffled by the glass of the car windows, but audible nonetheless. Mitch shut off the engine and we both jumped out of the car. We could make them out more clearly now, a girl's screams, and sounds of a struggle. Then a furious voice, unmistakably Wyatt's, shouting: *"YOU FUCKING LITTLE CUNT!"* followed by the sound of a blow and a cry of pain.

Mitch glanced at me and we exchanged a look of alarm and dawning realization. I think we both understood at once what must be happening in that cabin. "Shit," Mitch hissed, and then we both charged at the door.

Mitch reached it first and slammed it open with his shoulder. I was a split-second behind him.

We both froze there for a second at the hideous spectacle that lay before us.

Kenny was backed into the corner, trembling, an almost comical look of horror on his face, hands held up in the air.

In the middle of the room Wyatt was on the floor straddling the girl, his pants down around his ankles, his hands wrapped tightly around her throat, throttling her with all his strength. His face was red and twisted into an insane snarl of rage. The girl's face was turning purple. Her eyes were bulging out of their sockets, her tongue sticking out of her mouth. She was thrashing around beneath Wyatt, but even as we watched, her struggles were weakening.

"Oh Jesus Christ!" Mitch said in a choked voice that was nearly a whisper, then he darted forward, moving for Wyatt. "YOU FUCKER!" he shouted.

Wyatt released his grip on the girl and spun around, suddenly alarmed. He started to reach into his jacket for his pistol, but Mitch was on him in a flash, tackling him. He disarmed Wyatt, then ordered me to cover the maniac while he checked on the girl. I drew my .45 and kept it pointed at the psychopath on the floor.

Mitch examined the motionless body of the girl. His head fell forward, his shoulders slumping. He groaned in dismay.

"She dead?" I asked, never taking my eyes off Wyatt, who glared back at me, his teeth bared.

"Yeah, I think so," Mitch said flatly. He stood up, and turned slowly, deliberately, to where Wyatt lay cowering. Mitch's eyes were blazing with outrage and he was quaking with fury.

Wyatt, realizing what was about to happen, pointed his finger at Mitch and spoke defensively. "Hey, don't even fucking think about--"

WHAM! Mitch smashed his fist into Wyatt's face, putting his full 250 pounds into the blow. Wyatt was knocked back, his head slamming into the floor so hard it made the boards rattle.

Mitch leaped on him like a cat, beating him to a pulp in a wild, merciless frenzy, a mindless barrage of left and right blows. Wyatt began to scream, then he began to shriek, then he began to wail, then he began to sob like a five-year-old girl who just dropped her ice cream cone on the sidewalk.

Finally the rain of blows slackened and stopped. Mitch, exhausted, got to his feet, panting. Wyatt writhed and moaned, his face an unrecognizable mess of blood and swollen flesh.

Mitch drew his gun and pointed it down at Wyatt's head, shielding his face with his other hand against the impending splatter. His finger started to tighten over the trigger...but at the last second, he refrained from pulling it. He lowered the pistol and looked down with contempt at the sniveling, whimpering killer. "A bullet to the brain's too good for you," he seethed. "I'm going to leave you alive for The Russian. After he hears what you did, you're gonna *wish* for a shot in the head." Mitch looked at me. "Tie this son of a bitch up."

I looked in my pockets and found a couple extra Zip ties from earlier. I quickly bound Wyatt's hands and ankles together.

Mitch turned to Kenny, who had been cowering against the wall the whole time. Glaring, Mitch took a menacing step in his direction, causing Kenny to start shuddering in terror. "What the fuck were you doing just standing there?" Mitch demanded. "Why didn't you try to *stop* him?"

"I tried, Mitch, I swear I did!" Kenny blubbered in a panic. "He went crazy after you guys left. I tried to stop him but he pulled his gun and put it in my face, said he'd kill me if I got in the way. There was nothing I could do!" Kenny's knees buckled and he slid down the wall into a sitting position and began to weep.

Mitch turned away from him in disgust. He looked at the dead girl. "I'm sorry, Katrina," he said softly, then crossed the room and sat down on a couch. He lowered his head into his hands and moaned.

I turned away from Wyatt, now safely restrained, and looked down at the girl's body. She was almost naked, her torn clothing scattered around her, her body covered in bruises, her neck a hideous purple color. I could see the marks of Wyatt's fingers around her throat. The pillowcase had come off her head during the struggle and for the first time I saw her face. She had long blonde hair and was very pretty...or had been anyway. Her dead eyes were open, staring up at the ceiling in sightless horror, her tongue still protruding from her mouth. I felt a wave of pity and disgust.

"This changes things, doesn't it?" I said to Mitch.

"Not as much as you might think," he replied.

I looked at him, confused and was getting ready to ask him to elaborate, but just then his phone rang in his jacket pocket. He took it out and looked at it. "It's The Russian," he said, then answered it.

"Yeah, it's me, Sergei. What's the word?" Mitch listened for about a minute and nodded. "That's good." He listened, then said in response to whatever The Russian had asked: "Well, things are pretty much a shitstorm here. It...kinda got out of hand, but I'm on top of it now. It went down pretty much as we had planned...just not exactly how we intended it to." He listened. "Yeah, the girl's gone." He listened. "Yeah, I know we weren't supposed to do it until after we knew for sure he was going to pay. You can thank that piece of shit Wyatt for that. I'll explain when we get back." He listened. "Yeah, Sergei, I will."

Mitch ended the call. He looked at me and Kenny. "A little good news. Looks like the guy's gonna pay."

I stared at Mitch, something dawning on me. "You were planning on killing her all along, weren't you? You never were going to let her go."

Mitch said nothing.

"Christ, Mitch, you promised her!"

He shrugged. "I lied." He gave me a look. "Jesus, what fuckin fairytale world are you living in? You seriously think we could just turn her loose when this was all said and done? Get real. This is serious business. We can't leave any witnesses."

"She didn't know our names, she never saw our faces!" I protested.

"But she heard our voices. Sometimes that's enough. Couldn't take that chance." He sighed and rubbed his face. "But it wasn't supposed to be...like *that*..." he looked over at her naked, violated corpse, hideously sprawled on the floor nearby. "One in the back of the head. Quick and painless. She never would have even known."

"She was just a little stuck-up rich bitch!" Wyatt screeched at Mitch. "We were gonna waste her anyway! Why let it go to waste?"

*"Shut the fuck up or I'll shut you the fuck up!*" Mitch bellowed at him.

"So what do we do now?" Kenny asked.

"We gotta get rid of the evidence. We'll bury her out in the woods. Then we'll burn this whole place down."

"Why not just leave her in here? She'll burn up with everything else," Kenny said.

"Too risky. A fire might not get rid of everything. Teeth, for instance. We can't leave a single trace of her behind." He pointed at me and Kenny. "You two, go outside and find a good out-of-the-way place and dig a grave. A deep one. There's a work shed around the side. Should be a shovel or two in there. I'll stay here and keep an eye on...this *thing*." He looked at Wyatt.

Kenny and me looked at each other nervously. "Sure, Mitch," I said. We left the cabin.

\*\*\*\*\*

We found a small, remote clearing several hundred yards away from the cabin and took turns digging a 6-foot-deep grave under the light of the full moon. It took almost two hours and by the time we were finished the moon was almost fully risen. It was nearly midnight. I didn't say much, too preoccupied with my own thoughts, but Kenny just kept crying and saying "I wish I'd never gotten involved in this job" while playing with his St. Christopher's medal. He was a total wreck.

Finished, exhausted and dirty, we headed back to the cabin.

Mitch was sitting in a chair guarding Wyatt.

"Done," I told him.

"Alright. Good. Now bury her."

We went to the girl's body and started to pick her up. We stopped. "Mitch..." I said.

The girl's body...was *moving*. Twitching and shuddering spasmodically.

"What?" he asked without looking at us.

"You, uh, you might want to come see this," I said.

He got up and come over. "What the fuck?" he said when he saw what was happening.

"She's still alive!" Kenny exclaimed.

"Nah. It's just a death reflex," I argued. "Rigor mortis setting in."

"Yeah," Mitch agreed, "that's probably all it--"

The girl blinked her eyes. They turned to look at us. She opened her mouth and moaned.

"Jesus fuck, she *is* alive!" Mitch said in disbelief.

She sat up and began to get to her feet. We backed away from her slowly, too shocked by this phenomenon to know how to react.

As we watched in dreamy, unbelieving horror, she began to *change*.  Her skin began to ripple all over her body, as if things were moving underneath it. Her body began to contort. We could hear her muscles contracting. She opened her mouth wide and emitted a long, high-pitched shriek that started to change halfway through, becoming deeper and guttural until it didn't sound remotely human. The primal howl of an animal. Thick, coarse black hair began to burst through her skin. Her mouth and nose began to push out from the rest of her face, elongating, turning into a *snout*. Her teeth grew and became pointed. Her fingernails extended into six-inch claws.

"Is this really happening?" Kenny said in a near-daze to no one in particular.

Its transformation complete, the thing that had been a dead girl just minutes before stood before us in its full grotesque glory, no longer human, a hideous beast-creature covered in black fur, a huge mouth full of needle-point fangs, and hands that had become claws tipped with razor-sharp talons. It looked at us. Even its eyes were inhuman. Yellow and luminous. *The eyes of a wolf.*

We cowered before it, no more than ten feet away. It stood between us and the door of the cabin. We were trapped. It took a step in our direction. Then it turned its attention to the man bound on the floor.

Wyatt.

He had also been privy to the girl's transformation and was struggling against his restraints, uselessly trying to free himself, terrified. Easy prey.

The beast roared and pounced upon him. Wyatt's pants were still down around his ankles. It attacked him where he was most vulnerable, where his body was most exposed. Wyatt screamed hysterically in agony and terror. *"HELP ME OH JESUS GET IT OFF GET IT OFF ME HELP ME HELP ME HELP--"*

"Get in the bathroom!" Mitch shouted at me and Kenny while the monster was busy with Wyatt. "Now! Hurry!" We bolted down the hallway in the back of the cabin into the small bathroom. Mitch slammed the door. We could still hear Wyatt shrieking in the other room. After a while, it stopped. Then all we could hear was the beast feeding.

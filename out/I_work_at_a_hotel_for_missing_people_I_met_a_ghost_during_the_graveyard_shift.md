Now even before my little Scarlet fever problem, there have always been plenty of things about this job that make it a total pain in the ass. I mean Mostly the murders but trust me that’s not the only thing on the list, and at the top of that list, well I mean under the whole you know…murder thing, and that would be the night shift. Something I am somehow always stuck doing. Why is the late night shift so bad you ask? Well simple, all of our worst guests seem to be most active at that time. Which for me means troves of Clorox and body bags. I mean hey it’s a five star hotel man, the guest comes first no matter what it is they’re ordering for room service. I’ve participated in more rituals and sacrifices than I’d care to admit. Yeah apparently Lucifer is reeeaaaal particular when it comes what time of day a virgin needs to be sacrificed. Seriously, the amount of people that have been drowned in goat blood is more than 0, which as far as i’m concerned is enough to warrant burning this place to the ground but you know that’s just me. Then again there’s probably a lot of things about this place that warrant a good arson strike. However last night's shift was something I'm still trying to comprehend, for many concerning reasons.

It was about 2am when I finished up delivering my third order of tarps and corrosive acid until I had finally managed to make it back to the front desk for a few moments of rest. This rest would be short lived however, as near moments after sitting down and opening my book the soft chime of the entrance doors opening rang through the lobby. With a deep sigh and a few internal insults and slurs, I placed my book back down and put on my best don’t wanna kill myself face on and looked up to see a man dressed in fine black Victorian England attire designed to cloak the man in a shroud of mystery. He walked with a gold cane with extravagant engraving running along the side, and whistled a soft tune that sounded like some sort of old nursery rhyme as he approached the desk. Strangest of all was his face, or rather lack of one I should say. Now that’s not to say he was missing a face per say, but for the life of me I can’t remember a single detail of any real importance. I know he had two eyes, two ears, a nose and a mouth. I think he might’ve had a mustache too but I can’t exactly remember. I do remember very specifically his smile however, due to how greasy it was, figuratively I mean. That kind you see on sleaze balls who knows something nobody else does. 

“Hello my young friend, I’ve been told this island of yours is a sanctuary of sorts for those who wish to stay hidden. One in which we’re free to work on our practices as we please. I’d very much like to book a room. I can assure you rent will be no issue, money is little more than an object to me.” He said in an almost too stereotypical classy, old timey English accent. I looked up and raised an eyebrow, trying to determine if he was doing some sort of bit, before shaking my head softly and putting my customer service face back on. “Uh, yeah man no problem…and can I get a name?” I asked as I readied the guest book and grabbed a pen. the scummy smile of his grew as I asked. “Jack.” He stated, a hint of pride in his voice as he did. I looked at him again, then the book, then back to him. “Alright then, let me guess, last name Ripper?” I asked sarcastically letting out a few quick laughs as I studied the man’s what I now assumed to be cosplay.

“Precisely.” He responded, that pride in his voice raising even more. I let out a hardy laugh, before looking up to see he didn’t find it as amusing as I did. “Okay, so you’re telling me you are THE Jack the Ripper? like, the whole uncatchable night walker killer of London Jack the ripper?” I said slowing my laughter as I wiped a tear from my eye. “Well you look pretty good for a nearly 200 year old psychopath.” I said sarcastically trying to break some tension, only to realize I’ve only built more by being a smart ass. “Is there something so amusing about me boy?” he asked, well more so demanded, with a sharp hiss in his voice. Now I wasn’t exactly sold on his claims, but I knew better than to fuck with the nut jobs who stay here too hard. He was now on the property, and therefore, he was now a valued customer. So with a slight bite of the tongue I swallowed down any other smart ass remarks that could’ve possibly come to mind before clearing my throat and returning to business.

“Oh uh…no just not every night you meet the worlds most mysterious serial killer in history is all.” I stated trying to sound as formal as possible. He cracked his cane and let out a hardy laugh. “Ah yes my reputation proceeds me. I can assure you young man i’m no specter or mirage of any sorts. I am indeed flesh and blood.” He said with a prideful bow. I looked at him for a moment, simply just trying to process if this guy was completely fucking with me or what, but decided to continue playing on. “Well Jack, don’t suppose you could help me out with some woman problems.” I said with a slight chuckle before realizing how dark that joke sounded coming out, as I handed him his room key. His response was something both interesting…and rather concerning. “I wouldn’t cross that witch with the fanciest of your modern day artillery. I’ve seen evil boy, and contain a fair amount of it myself, but that woman is closer to a blood thirsty succubus.” He stated bluntly, and somewhat worried.Before I could ask any other questions he quickly grabbed the keys from my hands and left, as if not wanting to speak of it any further. 

Seemed he made the right move as not long after Scarlet had come for her what feels like hourly check ups. An interaction I've grown used to…well tolerant to would probably be a better way to describe it, but well after hearing Jack the fucking Ripper shit bricks over the passing mention of her let’s just say this visit was as unsettling as our first meeting. “Well he was dressed weird, there a cosplay event going on?” she asked with a smile as she began to lean over the desk, and I have to say i’m VERY unnerved with how comfortable she’s gotten around me, especially with the knowledge i’m now armed with. “Um, yeah something like that.” I said trying to remain as calm as possible. She looked at me, almost studying my face before giving another smile and walking away. I slowly sat back down into my chair and let out a sigh of relief, that’s until she stopped to speak up again.  “you know, you’re cute when your scared.” she said in tone that sent chills down my spine, before almost sarcastically wishing me a good night sleep and leaving the lobby. Now sure I probably wasn’t as calm as normal but I’ve learned to hide my fear without people seeing like a pro, and that’s what worries me. I don’t think my poker face failed me, because it didn’t feel like she “saw” my fear, but more so felt it. Almost as if she could smell it off of me…and in that moment it felt like I was swimming with an open cut, and there was a shark in the water. 

I don’t know if it’s just the man’s ways with words or if she really is some sort of demon, but shit I can definitely believe it. Then again I did also convince myself I had a conversation with a historical shadow so maybe I've just officially snapped and dove into the deep end. Either way I think i’m gonna head over to his room in the morning and pry a bit more. Even if he’s not who claims to be, it’s clear he knows something about this chick that might save me from becoming her pet or whatever it is she got brewing in that twisted skull of hers, but unfortunately there is no rest for the wicked and break is just about up and I don’t get paid to worry about the many threats around me.

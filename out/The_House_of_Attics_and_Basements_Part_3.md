“Was that him?” I asked, but Emily was already running for the house. She sprinted up the front stairs and fumbled for her keys at my front door. They didn’t work. Without missing a beat, she took a pocketknife out of her back pocket and began digging at the lock.

“Get the door!” She shouted. “Hurry!”

I jogged over as fast as I could and opened the lock. Inside, the house was quiet. Emily started to head toward the stairs, but I held her arm.

Opening my security camera app, I checked for activity all around the house and found none. The attic ladder had been lowered. I followed Emily upstairs and down the hall, right to the spot where the Traveler had been standing.

“Must have left in a rush,” she said bitterly. “He was right there. Right there.”

Shattered glass shimmered like ice at her feet. She looked out into the darkness of the front yard, and the wind from the broken window pushed at her light brown hair. She looked cold, and for a moment, I had the odd urge to hug her, though of course I didn’t.

“There’s a chance I can still catch him,” she said. “I’ve got to–I’ve got to go.”

She stopped at the base of the attic stairs and tossed me the gun.

“Might want to sleep with this from now on. I won’t be back, but he will.” She paused for a moment, and then added. “I’m sorry about some of the things I’ve said before. There are worse things to be than lazy. Back home…” She trailed off. “Just, stay safe. Lock your door. Maybe, if you’re lucky, he won’t be interested in you.”

I realized she was still holding the small pocketknife that she’d tried to use to open the front door. Looking closer, I saw that it was my father’s, bearing the distinctive image of Janus.

“Wait,” I said. “I can’t let you take that. It’s mine.”

She laughed. “Check your pocket.”

When I did, I was surprised to find my father’s pocketknife in its usual place. I examined it in the light. Impossible. The knife was custom, not to mention centuries-old. It was like seeing two copies of the Mona Lisa, side by side.

“Goodbye, Steve,” she said.

She started up the ladder, and I followed. I wanted to tell her to wait, that I still had questions, but she was already practically out of sight. And even though I wanted to rush after her, I could barely bring myself to go into the attic. I followed her up the ladder, slowly, a rung at a time.

“Please,” I said as I tried to force myself to keep climbing. “Just one more thing.”

“Make it quick,” she shouted back at me.

“How do I see you again?”

“Like I said, I’m not coming back.” 

“Please,” I said. “I just–”

“If you really want answers, they’re all in the library. I’d start with John Lewis, 1800. He had a lot of it figured out. Read what he wrote. Or don’t. It’s up to you.”

I heard her footsteps above me now, moving in the direction of the clock.

“Wait,” I tried to add. “With all of those things you were searching for on my computer–”

I stopped speaking as a faint blue pulse of light flashed through the room. My head had just reached the attic floor, and through the flash, I saw Emily’s silhouette fading into nothing, almost as if disintegrating, the tiny pieces of shadow being sucked into the clock’s face, which glowed a brilliant blue. Then, suddenly, the light was gone.

I turned on my phone’s flashlight and fumbled through the darkness toward the clock. Reaching out, I touched the face and found it cold to the touch, like touching the window of a grocery store refrigerator or a window on a winter’s night.

“Emily?” I asked, but there was no response.

She was gone, and she wasn’t coming back. The fact of it hit hard. 

I couldn’t quite explain why, but the thought that I’d never see this girl again hurt me in a way I hadn’t felt in years. At first, I thought it was just curiosity. Between the knife, the weird web searches, and everything Emily had said, I had a thousand unanswered questions. But it wasn’t just that.

Even though I’d barely known her for a few hours, and I’d spent most of those at gunpoint, I couldn’t escape the idea that we were somehow linked. Every fiber of my being told me to follow her.

But how?

I examined every surface of the clock, looking for a way to open it. I tried to find any sort of door or latch–anything that would open the clock so I could look inside, but there was nothing. I knocked on the clock, searching for hollow spaces, but there was no sound. I may as well have been knocking on a solid tree trunk.

Over the next few hours, I tried it all. Knocking, kicking, shouting ‘open sesame,’ and my own name, and my father’s and Emily’s, but the clock simply continued its tick tock, its mechanical laugh.

I was sweating now, even with the cold night air. I brought up a six pack to drink and cool down. Then I tried to take the clock apart. 

I lugged my father’s rusting toolkit from the barn and got down to business. I tried to pry open the wood inlay with a screwdriver, but I couldn’t even scratch it. It was as if the wood were steel or iron. Ever weirder, the ancient glass of the clock’s face was just as strong. I tried screwdrivers, drills, and then a hammer. 

Finally, I brought a heavy garden shovel and swung it at the clock's face with full force. It, too, bounced off with nary a scratch, as if the glass were a brick wall. Same for the wood base. The shovel ricocheted off it and gave my hand a nasty cut. 

Clock 1, Stephen 0.

Next, I tried to budge the clock from its position against the wall but found it to be completely immovable. No matter how I strained, it remained in place, as if bolted in place with steel rivets. A crowbar made no difference. The things was stick.

All the while, the clock continued its incessant ticking and tocking, an unseen pendulum swinging even as the second and hour hand remained in place, both pointed directly and the seven.

Giving up, I went downstairs to clean and bandage my injured hand. 

The smell of isopropyl alcohol was intoxicating as I poured it over my wound, and I quickly found myself back in the kitchen, opening a bottle of red. Carefully, I took my Sharpie and drew a line in the usual spot on the wine bottle, committing myself not to fall back into bad habits.

In truth, though, it had been a stressful day, and I couldn’t be blamed for breaking a minor self-imposed rule. The clock, after all, could wait.

I walked to the office and settled into my father’s chair, a Bordeaux glass in hand, watching the light catch the red swirls as I helped the wine breathe. Searching the shelves, I found the old, leatherbound family archive I’d seen my father leaf through on occasion and flipped through the years until I got to 1800.

My father had been an obsessive, unable to let go of even the smallest problem. Once, when his truck wouldn’t start, he had disappeared into the garage overnight, toolbox in hand. He was a farmer without much mechanical experience. But I woke to find him still awake, his truck disassembled all around him, each small part carefully organized according to some complex system known only to him.

“Don’t touch anything,” was all he said.

For three days, my father practically lived in the garage, leafing through the owners manual and fiddling with various gears and pistons. On the fourth day, he slept for nearly 24 hours. Then he woke up and got back to work. On the fifth day, the truck was reassembled, and on the sixth day, my father drove it to town, returning with a two hundred-dollar bottle of scotch.

He had taken a rest in the same chair I sat in now. Here, he slowly took down the bottle two inches at a time. Twelve years old, I had entered his study cautiously and congratulated him.

“All I did was not give up,” he said. “Try it sometime.” He shook his head, drank a bit more and settled deeper into the soft leather of the chair. “French lessons. Guitar. Dancing, for god's sake. I’ve still got the Clarinet you never even opened. Little master. Dilettante. Little master of giving up.”

It had been a few hours later, long after my father had passed out dead asleep, that I woke to see a stranger watching over me. He sat in the antique rocking chair in the corner of my room, the one where my mother had once held me, even when I was far too old to be babied.

He didn’t speak at first, but I heard a slow, scratching sound and smelled the distinctive scent of pine. Paralyzed in fear, I didn’t move, trying to breathe evenly so he wouldn’t realize I’d seen him. As the minutes passed, I saw moonlight catch the wide side of a blade in his right hand and realized he was whittling. I couldn’t be sure, but it looked like a small pocket knife.

“I had considered,” said the man, his voice oddly familiar, “hanging you by your feet, your neck opened just so above the collarbone. Up somewhere high. A tree or a roof, so that they found your puddle first. Another option would be skinning you alive.”

“Please,” I said quietly. “Please.”

“But what. Would. Be. The. Point?” He stood now, nearly shaking with anger. “Your death would barely register. Just like your mother’s.” He paced the room, dragging the knife along the wallpaper, which slowly peeled.

“What do you want?” I asked.

“That’s easy,” he said, still pacing. “All you’ve got to do is keep up the good work. Keep being you.”

My father claimed he didn’t believe me, at least to my face. Over time, even I had come to believe the visit was a nightmare. Now I knew the truth. The Traveler had been there all along, waiting for something. Waiting until I had something to lose.

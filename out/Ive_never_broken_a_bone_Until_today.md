Flexibility. It's something that some people have and some people don't. Many people I know are quite stiff and can't bend their arms, legs, etc very far. I however am different. Throughout my childhood I've always been flexible. I could bend my fingers back farther than everyone I knew, and I'd never broken a bone because I would just bend. If I fell down and my arm hit the ground it would bend. If a football hit my fingers they would bend. I'd never in my life had any kind of broken or sprained bone. Until two years ago. 

I was hanging out with my friend whose name I won't mention for privacy's sake. We were at his house playing Mortal Kombat while we waited for our other friend to arrive. I went to go get a coke when all of a sudden my friend yelled "WHAT THE FUCK." "Calm down" I said. "What's wrong." "LOOK AT YOUR FUCKING ARM MAN" he screamed. " Oh quit being so drama...." I looked down. My arm was bent all the way back so my hand was touching my shoulder but my elbow was still facing downwards. I screamed. Just as I did our other friend arrived and saw me with my fucked up arm and my friend throwing up next to me. At first he was also freaking out but eventually agreed to take me to the hospital while my other friend calmed down.

When we got to the emergency room I was immediately treated. The doctor asked how this had happened and was perplexed when I said I looked down and it was just broken. They had put on a cast and instructed me to wear a sling. Thank god I'm Canadian or the medical bills would of destroyed me.

I went to bed that night dreading the recovery that awaited. No playing video games, no going to work and it would take me forever to get my school work done. When I woke up that morning I was confused. My cast and sling were missing and my arm felt completely fine. I could move it and it didn't hurt whatsoever. I drove to my friends house and he was equally perplexed when I showed him. I was excited that my arm was healed but was also concerned about why the break had happened in the first place, why I didn't feel any pain, and why it healed so quickly.

To this day I still don't know why or how it happened. I'm still friends with the two individuals I mentioned in this story and they love to tell this story to people we meet.

Other people have guessed maybe it was a group hallucination or that my arm wasn't actually broken as bad as I thought. I know better. I didn't imagine it and I saw how broken it was. It looked fucking inhuman. IM NOT FUCKING CRAZY. TWO OTHER PEOPLE SAW IT. I still get called crazy to this day and nobody has ever believed me or my friends.

Since this incident nothing like it has ever happened again but I'm extra careful anyway. I type this now two years since this event sitting in my bedroom. In closing..... Wait a second, what happened to my-oh you gotta be fucking kidding me.

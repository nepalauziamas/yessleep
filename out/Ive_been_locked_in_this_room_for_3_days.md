 I've been locked in this room for 3 days.    

I do not know how it happened?.    

The last thing I remember before this is that I was working very late, to  To be exact until 3 am, I know it was 3 because I remember looking at my watch.   

When I try to remember something else my head spins and I get a migraine  fucking painful.    

"Ahhh fuck, how to get here, shit"   

After that it's like my brain has erased everything to the point where  I opened my eyes and it was here.    

a fucking 4x4 room with a bathroom and no windows at all.   

 Well.... actually there is one, but it is covered by a very thick plate of  steel.    

The first day in here I had a panic attack.  

I think any of you would understand me if you put yourself in my place.    

Imagine waking up and being inside a place you can't  go out .

&#x200B;

 the first 6 hours I was able to endure a bit of despair.   

I thought. maybe someone will come looking for me soon.   

But nothing has happened.    

I haven't even been able to hear anyone outside.   

I think I should calm down a bit so I can better tell you about my situation.    

I will start from yesterday, since the first day I only dedicated myself to trying to break  some wall, cry and then fall asleep from exhaustion.      

I got out of bed and started looking around the room and the bathroom.   

By the way the bathroom has a shower a sink and a toilet.   

It is not much but it covers the needs of a bathroom.    

Believe me I looked in every fucking corner of this room and I didn't find anything.  

important except for this cell phone.    

And if you want to ask why I haven't called the police or something else  how to ask for help in a social network, â€¦..ahhhh    Let me tell you I tried to do it over 100 times.   

I don't know if it's the phone or what, but I can't get into Facebook or any other  website, more than this.    I also called many, many times 911. 

&#x200B;

They haven't answered any of my calls.   

I can't peek through the door either, this one is also sealed, but by bricks.    

There is something that bothers me a lot.    

I don't know why but, I guess if you kidnap a person and block the entrance to  that it does not come out, it is impossible for you to come out if you blocked it while inside.    

"ohhh god i sound like a fucking madman"    

the thing is that the tools to have locked the door are inside.    

A mason's spoon, a mason's bucket and on the ground it seems that there is so much lime  like cement and I think those little yellow grains are sand.    

I mean, there's no way I could have done this to myself.    

Why the fuck would I lock myself in a fucking 4x4 room.    

the only good thing is that I have enough canned food piled in the  room walls.    

It seems whoever locked me up here doesn't want me to starve.    

Or maybe he dies before he can do whatever he's up to.    

\*sigh.\*    

"Damn...."      

I don't see a logical sense to this.

 I spent a while looking at the walls of this room.   

Actually this is very strange, I don't see power outlets on the walls, and I don't see  I found a switch for that pesky ceiling light.    

That damn light, it's not a normal light, it's an ultra violet light.    

Having to see her all the time is annoying.    the good thing is that the phone looks perfect.   

And speaking of which... I tried to find some information to know who it was from  this phone and I can't access his WhatsApp.    All your files have a password just like the image gallery.    

I explain a little, try to open the image gallery and a  blank bar to enter characters and on it it said:  enter password,  clue:  I am half of half of your day what am I?    

It's been a while since I started writing.    

Before finishing this post I ask you to please help me.    

I need to find a way out of here.

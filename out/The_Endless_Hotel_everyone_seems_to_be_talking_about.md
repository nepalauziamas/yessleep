It was a bright, hot summer day, I feel tired and want to rest at a hotel. I come across a fancy hotel called Blaksey Hotel, I get into an elevator that seems to take eternity to reach the floor. The elevator finally chimes and it takes I to a lobby like floor with a receptionist desk and a bell. I ring the bell and the receptionist working at the desk welcomes me, "Welcome to Blaksey Hotel would you like to rent a room?". I say yes and the receptionist takes the key that says number 1 on it and says "follow me to your room please".

The receptionist unlocks the door and on the other side is a hallway with another door that has a gold plating on it that says 0002. She says "Right this way sir", I look through the only window on the floor and it is dark and storming outside. Which is weird because I entered the hotel when it was bright and hot outside, I ask the receptionist what time it is and she simply states, "It's 35 o'clock dear". I'm shocked by the response and just go along with it as its some kind of prank.

After a while of walking through rooms the receptionist finally says "This place isn't what it seems to be." I get a little anxious thinking that maybe all this isn't a prank. The receptionist says "There are monsters.. people not from our world." Me and the receptionist stop walking, she says "If you want to survive you must follow audio ques that the monsters emmit, there are 6 monsters in this hotel."

The receptionist says "The first entity that you will come across most commonly is called rush, he will flicker the lights and will rush across the room that you are in breaking the lights, you will have 5 seconds to hide in a closet that is in the room." I start feeling worried like I can't escape from this hotel. The receptionist continues "The second monster only appears in pitch black rooms and is called screech and will emmit a psst or a whisper and you must find him and stare at him to dodge his attack." My sanity starts to gradually decrease and I feel like I'm going insane, the receptionist looks at me and says "Eyes and Seek are up next, Eyes is a purple void of eyes in the center of a room do NOT stare at it they don't like to be stared at. Seek you will give you lots of hints, Black eyes will start appearing in the next couple rooms Though they are harmless they lead up to something big.. If you get to a large hallway a black figure with one eye rises and runs at you, Run away from it and bookshelves with start falling slide under the shelves with blue lights. There are doors also with blue lights that you must go through in order to not die." 

I start thinking that there must be a way out, an exit. I'm not really a optimist but in this situation any escape is a good outcome. This must all be a big prank I think, I start looking around for hidden cameras, but there are none. The receptionist calmly says "Two more monsters await you there is a ghost like figure called halt he will try to get close to you by all means necessary. You must turn around when he disappears, he MUST be in front of you at all times. The figure is a tall, slender being with a mouth for a head with sharp teeth, although he is blind he with use sound against you, he appears only every 50 rooms." 

We start traveling through the endless hotel and hope to make it out alive...

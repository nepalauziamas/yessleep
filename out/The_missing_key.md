It was about 2:00 pm and me and my friends were hanging out and chilling. There were a few people there that i didnt know personally some i knew by name. after we got done talking and smoking pot i decided to leave my friends apartment and go get ready for work since i had a 4 hour shift. I finally got home and only had a a few minutes to get ready for work and then walk two blocks there. I didnt drive there so i didnt haft to waste any gas. I get to the front steps and reach for my house key when i realized i didnt have it. i started to worry because if i didnt have its back at my friends house and if  its at my friends house then he has it. The only reason i was worried because last time i left my key at his house he used it to sneak in while i was watching tv with my girlfriend and scared the living shit out of us it was like a horror movie. so i said id get it from him after work if he isnt already at my house ready to pull some michael myers bullshit. i went around back and lifted up this gnome that i got to get my spare key i thought it was smart.

I soon got done with my sift and started walking home. i noticed this guy that was 1 block away from my house i thought nothing of it but something seemed off when i walked next to him. Like i shouldnt be anywhere near him. i finally  got home and i went around back for my spare when i noticed it was gone the only person who knew was my girlfriend so i assumed she was there i didnt see her car but sometimes she likes to walk or get a ride from her friends. I walked up to the door and opened it i noticed it was pitch black i usually leave my kitchen light on so if anyone tried to break in while i was gone would see the light was on and leave my house alone.

I walked inside and felt terrified like i was about to get killed i yelled out my girlfriends name. I got no reply i soon remembered that my friend had my key so i thought he was inside and was going to play a prank on me so i walked around the house until i got to the bathroom i heard whispers from inside and knew that my girlfriend was helping. So i opened the door and walk to the sink and started talking to myself saying some weird stuff to try and make them laugh i thought i heard my girlfriend chuckle but as soon as i turned off the light they jumped out from the shower and "scared me". I got them back by acting like it really got me and i feel to the ground and started gasping for air and holding my chest my friend and girlfriend started to panic. my girlfriend crying and my friend trying to do cpr i got up after he tried to do mouth to mouth on me i wasnt having any of that. They were all mad and started pushing me around. We soon settled down after my friend chased me around the house. We all sat in the living room watching the new childs play movie that had come out a few months back. About half way through the movie though i heard a knock. Not from the door from the window in the kitchen i only knew it was the kitchen because i only have three windows in the downstairs area. two in the living room and one in the kitchen i could see the two windows in the living room. It was a loud knock there were many more. I felt my skin crawl.

  
i walked to the kitchen and looked out the window with much hesitation. Right then i saw the most disturbing horrific thing i had ever seen in my life it was the man from the walk home holding my spare key with a bloody knife. He ran away from the window and i rushed to the front door i told my friend to help block it. he was confused and then he saw the man run in front of the window to the door and jumped up to help we put the couch and my kitchen table in front of it. for some reason he didnt try to get in the house put we heard scratching we assumed it was the knife. not much time later the police arrived because my girlfriend had called them while we were blocking the front door. the man was arrested turns out he was on very hardcore drugs and had stabbed 2 random people a block away from the house and he saw me walking home. The two people were fine and recovered months later me and my friend laugh about it sometimes but my girlfriend broke up with me because she didnt feel safe around me or my house i didnt blame her. i moved into my friends apartment months later and i still think about what could of happened if he got inside.

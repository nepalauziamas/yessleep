I’m  a massage therapist in one the most populous cities in America. Generally, I love my job. I get to help people find peace. You come in- stressed and tense. I get to relieve you of those feelings. It fulfills me in a way. I get to work in a place I’ve set up as all my own, a sanctuary. 


It’s a medium sized room, painted a soft blue, always smelling of sandalwood, frankincense and myrrh incense  The massage table and chair sit in opposite corners of the room. Beside each, I have my rolling instrument trays set up with all sorts of oils and lotions. The drawers filled with tools to aid in my journey of giving my clients peace. There is a soft music playing in the background, something soothing. I want people to be comfortable here. I get to help people, and I get paid. Win win. 



Except for when the client is an “inappropriate man”, as I like to call them. Vile disgusting beings. They usually come in off the streets without calling for an appointment. These men make indecorous inquires and vile comments while checking in, but I check them in all the same. Why you ask? Because I have a job to do, and most of these dreadful individuals have fat wallets. Besides, I don’t get to pick and choose who I help. They come to me. 




One evening, 15 minutes before closing I was wiping down the chair as I heard the front door bell jingle, the door thrown open and shut haStily. I  threw my cleaning rags in the laundry chute, and patted my dress apron back down as I walked into the waiting room to see who had come in. I assumed it was someone looking to make an appointment for the next day, but I was wrong. It was an inappropriate man, unfortunately. This one was short and fat. Stubby, even. A greasy little furball with a briefcase and a wicked grin. As I looked up from patting my dress down, our eyes met and then he clearly looked my body from top to bottom while licking his lips and speaking his most inner thoughts out loud with a revolting , “yes yes, that’ll do”. 
I pretended I didn’t hear him, and inquired CHANGEWORD on when he would like to make an appointment. 



“Now”, he snorted. 



“Sir, I close at 9” gesturing at the clock in the wall,” but I do open at 5 AM sharp as to get to work early for those on Wall Street. You look like one of those types. Smart. I bet you have made a ton of money this quarter. Let me put you down for 5 AM?” I replied, my voice dripping with honey.
 


he didn’t take the bait. 



He sucked snot back up in his nose while nodding his head, his chins jiggled and he said, “ you’re right sweet cheeks, I have made a ton of money this year, and I’m willing to spend some of it on you NOW so how about you get back in that room with me and do your job.” 



As he started to step around me, I realize he had locked the door behind him. The deadbolt was set at a very obvious vertical, the side latch- bolted. I felt all of the hairs on the back of my neck pickle up, and my heart rate quickened. I knew what he wanted. it wasn’t only a massage, but I was used to men like this. I knew how to say the right thing at the right time to remain safe. Years of practice around all types of people had shown me that. Sometimes inappropriate men came in better looking packages,  but not this one. I could see right through him. 



I followed him around to the back, and he was already half nude. He was undoing his belt buckle as I came around the corner. His silhouette disgusted me. As I drew closer to him, I got a good look at him under the light. He resembled a rat. Long nose. Beady eyes. Round greying body. I truly was not excited for this one. 



“Sir, most people keep their underwear on. It’s usually more comfortable for us both. Here’s a towel, wrap it around your waist and lay on the table please. “



“Well, why the fuck would I need a towel if I was going to keep my underwear on? that’s pretty stupid and redundant, don’t you think? I think I’ll be more comfortable with my underwear…off. Since I’m the paying customer and all, you should be fine.” he laughed at his own bad joke. 



He spun around and gave me a full view of his.. growing nether regions. He cracked a slick smile and laid down on my table without the towel wrapped around him. My poor poor massage table. 



I closed my eyes, took a deep breath and told myself that I was going to rush this one. It had already been a very long day. 
There had been an inappropriate man come in for a 5 AM appointment.  Which is interesting because the usual flow is one or two a week. Two in a day, the planets must be aligning or something.
I guess I was taking too long, lost in my thoughts, preparing his massage oil because the next thing I heard was, “ never brains and beauty huh? Are you slow?? And that’s not a compliment. Come the fuck on, I got places to be.”



My eyes rolled so hard that I thought they were going to roll all the way around back into the correct position. “No sir, I just thought I would make you a very special concoction of oils since you were such a respected man of Wall Street. You deserve only the best, right?” I said with the voice of a much younger woman than I actually am. Sweet, stupid,  and small just like inappropriate men love. 



“ concoction? That’s a big word for a girl like you. You sound like you just learned English.” He spat. 




“ Ehh, you are half right. I’m from… What you would now call Spain. “


“ i’m not trying to have a conversation with you. and it’s always been called Spain. I’m not paying you for these minutes.” Under his breathe he whispered, “now called Spain? It’s Spain? Idiot..”



I turned my music up a little bit and walked over to him. I laid the towel squarely across his backside. I took a moment to really take him in. Small, wretched little man. I could feel all of the horrible things he had done just standing next to him. He permeated the air around him with an aura like dirty dish water. It was putrid. I let the music permeate through my brain to calm myself. I felt it in my blood, burning through my veins with electricity. Beautiful, Slow, repetitive vibrations worked their way through my soul. I began dripping oils down the spine of his back while he settled in with deep slow breathes. 



I started my work. The massage started with deep tissue engagements. I found the knots he’d built up over the stress of scamming and ripping people off. Every muscle I relieved it was like a string plucked in which I could hear the music of what created that tension. He whimpered with pleasure, and I felt vomit rise in my throat. He was an inappropriate man,  alright. One of the worst I’d had. I could feel the pain of him laying his angry physicality upon those smaller than him. I could taste the sour dripping of all the sick satisfaction he got out of his destruction. I watched innocence flutter away in the wind while he ravaged. I worked my way down each leg while he moaned. More oil, I didn’t want to smell him. It was too much. 
As I got down towards his feet, he visions of the places he had been, and the damage he had inflicted with this feet was too much to bear. 


At that moment, he turned over. 


“It seems you don’t like feet much, how do you like this?“ he cooed. His manhood stood proudly in front of me. 



I gagged. 
The inappropriate man was not impressed. Matter of fact, I enraged him. He roared up from the table, grabbing me by my ponytail. 

“ You WILL finish me, and you will enjoy it too.” He screamed in rage. 


He was right. I was going to do both of those things, just not the way he had planned. 



If feigned fear for a few moments before I laughed. I’m sorry, but I’ve taken on much bigger inappropriate men before. This one was a joke.  His face reddened, beady eyes only slits as His grip tightened on my ponytail. I laughed open mouthed . I almost couldn’t catch my breath I was laughing so hard. 


That’s when he noticed my teeth. Yes, I’ve had my front file down and capped. They actually look quite beautiful, orthodontist did me good, but the rest. Well, The rest are a mess of razor sharp glass. I allowed my true self to take form. My eyes blinked sideways. My pupils dilated  between pure black and slits as I adjusted. I felt my claws growing back to their correct length, and I used one to hook under his fingers wrapped around my hair. one by one I snapped his fingers off of me while we made eye contact. He looked so very confused. 



As his arm fell down and away from my hair he took a few steps backwards. it was always interesting to me how inappropriate men worked. when he had entered  into my domain, he was cocky, entitled, full of rage, ready to release  it up on me. Now, so small, so full of fear. It always worked this way, even with the big ones. In the beginning of our interactions, We would both start as one thing, then by the end, we were both something else entirely. 



I stood. My ears stretched up to points, I could hear a woman walking down the sidewalk outside sneeze. My vision had adjusted so I started walking around my room, blowing out candles. The man hesitated then ran towards the door. It was useless. He had locked the front door for me, and I had locked this door for him. I watched him flail about my dominion, as I calmly extinguished the last of the light. 



I could see him shivering in the far corner. 
“WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU???!!” He cried.



I scrunched up my face, “ you know, I thought you would have realized that it was probably be a better idea to talk to me with some respect by now.
What were your plans here by the way? To take my virtue?” I lamented.



He trembled with fear. He looked pathetic, Naked and sweating, hiding being my massage chair now. I turned my music up louder, humming along now. “hmmm, mmm, sacrificiummm, ahhh” I chanted. 



“Just let me go. I won’t tell anyone you’re here. I won’t do this again.” He lied and begged for his life. 




I belly laughed again, “ inappropriate men and their lies. I can taste your thoughts from here. You might be honest in your promise to not tell on me, but you have no thoughts of stopping. We are both predators. You, of women and children. Me, of you.”



I was across the room in a second. I stood behind him with my talon to this throat. I could feel his heart thumping in his chest through my whole being. So sweet. 
The in appropriate man was rubbing off on me as I could feel myself taking sick satisfaction in his demise. This one had done so many abhorrent things, it was seeping across reality and into me. We can’t have that, so I slit his throat. Partially.  I gave him peace. 



I drug him over to one of my instrument tables and drained his blood into the chalice. I discarded his ruined body to the floor, and I drank slowly. As I consumed his soul, I come face-to-face with his demons as he could call them. To me, they were angels. I broke bread with each of the lives he had stamped out. I brought peace and mothering to the the little children he had taken. I brought serenity to the women he had broken. I wept. I tried to make right the carnage he had inflicted. Then I released them back to the True Mother, finally fully disconnected from this inappropriate man. 



I looked down at the revolting shell of the inappropriate man. I was exhausted. two, in one day? I didn’t want think about what this reality was coming to. I turned on the lights and I drug his body over to the laundry chute. Down it thudded. I cleaned up the mess he had made, and started to the basement. 



I reached the basement door and put the security code in. The door swung open and my baby was there to greet me. She bounced over and licked my cheek. 


“Dang girl, did I have some blood on my cheek that I missed!?” I giggled. 
She purred and rubbed her body up against my hip. At least she was eating good for tonight, and probably tomorrow too. As I said, she usually eats once or twice a week, this is like getting takeout twice in one day for her. I looked at the first Inappropriate man from this morning in the corner, he looked like an old dog toy. I told her I had a surprise for her. She was already pawing at the laundry chute. I opened it up and let the inappropriate man’s body fall to the floor. 
Onza was on it like a fly on shit. She tore his head off and batted it around the room. I filled her water bowl and fluffed her blanket. “ OK sweet girl, I love you. I’ll see you in the morning.“ I scratched her behind the ear, and left. 



It was 11 o’clock, and I had to be back in to work in 6 hours. I needed to get home pronto and take a melatonin. I would rest soundly tonight. My hope for tomorrow was for no more inappropriate men. Not for my sake, but for this worlds. Humans aren’t meant to beat and batter each other. This realm exists for true and pure connections. I’m only here to help that along.

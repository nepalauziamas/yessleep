Do not play the mod titled "memories"-Part 2

Hey again guys, It's been a while since i've been here....I'm currently in my closet...Hiding from Her.....I'm trying to tell you all this before it's too late...

Whilst I was gone I received a message on my phone from someone named keith....I was going to ignore it, but then another message popped up, then another, and another. I couldn't ignore it so I decided to read what this stranger was saying.

This is the conversation that followed: K-Keith A-Me\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

K: Hello, my name is keith. I need to talk to you...please answer.

K: Please don't ignore me...this is important.

K: Please Anna....answer me.

A: Who are you? How do you know my name?

K: My name is keith....and I'm here to help you....you need to know more about the circumstance you're in right? Y'know the one with the HAUNTED mod and what not?

A: How do YOU know??

K: You saw my video didn't you? The one with the man trying to warn people like you to not download a haunted mod?

A: You're that man? How do you know I saw the video? How do you know anything about me?

K: Listen, I am, or WAS in the same situation as you...Now i'm trapped in the game as one of the characters in Elden ring.

A: WHAT??? How did you get trapped in the game?

K: Cassandra.

A: Who is that?

K: Cassandra is the ghost of a girl who haunts the mod. She lures players foolish enough to download the mod, kills off their favorite characters by using memories and past trauma, and then killing the player and combining their soul with the programming of their favorite character. That bounds the player's soul to the game, more specifically, to the mod. I'm not the only one either, she's done this to numerous people, I'm the first one who bought it to light and was able to warn others in time.

A: Wait...she uses memories and past trauma? Then it makes sense now why the Npcs were saying the things they said.

K: What did the Npcs say?

A; they were talking about the year 1999...now I know why...

K: What do you mean?

A: My older sister died in 1999, she accidentally...hung herself at a playground. Now I understand why Morgott died that way in the game...Cassandra must've found the memory buried deep in my mind and she used that as ammunition.

K: I see...and she used Morgott because...your favorite character is Morgott correct?

A: Yes, he's the entire reason why I bought the game in the first place...I thought he was such a cool character. Seeing him die in front of me in such a way.....I felt bad for him...I wanted to help him...I wanted to SAVE HIM.

K: I see...

A: What about you? What happened to you?

K: I played the mod because I thought I was going to see some cool changes to the game...I heard the Npcs whisper as well...they bought up the year 2010. I found myself meeting starscourge radahn too early....yet, for some reason, I couldn't bring myself to stop playing... Then I saw him stab himself in the face with his own sword.....I did the same thing you did....I tried to stop him. I don't know what snapped in me to cause me to do something so odd...to care for a character that didn't even exist. It appeared that Cassandra had found the memory of when my Father got killed after being impaled in the face by a piece of plywood...She possessed Radahn's body to kill him the same way my father was killed. Then she possessed Radahn's dead body and came out of my TV screen, she started to chase me, but I outran her....I ran to my attic and hid. Then I filmed that youtube video....after I made the video, she found me in the attic, and dragged me through the TV, and bound my soul to Radahn's programming. I've been trapped here ever since. When you downloaded the mod, when all that crazy mess went down getting you into quite the predicament, I was able to see everything that happened to you. I've spent days trying to find a way to contact you..it's rather hard when you're trapped in a Video game.

A: So you're saying if ghost, Cassandra, manages to find me...she'll drag me into the TV, and bind my soul to Margit's programming...trapping me in the game as Margit and keeping my soul bound to the game forever?

K: Correct, I know this sounds crazy...However....it appears she hasn't found you yet....

A: I was lucky then huh?

K: No...If I can find you she sure can too. There's nothing you can do to stop her...your fate is inevitable...***~~SO STOP HIDING FROM ME~~***

A: What? Keith are you okay?

K: She's found us! You need to hide! NOW!!

A: Okay! Okay! Should I bring the phone too?

K: NO! Drop the phone, she can go through that to-------***~~WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY FROM ME????..STAY WITH ME, STAY WITH US!!! STOP RESISTING!!!!~~***

That was 2 hours ago...I'm still here inside my closet. I hope keith is alright.

All I can hear is Margit's (or should I say cassandra's) loud footsteps and slight cooing every once in a while...I know she's out there, trying to pull me inside...

I don't have much time left...she's right outside the closet...She hears me breathing....I Know I'm not going to make it....Please, whoever read this...this is my final message to the world...please do not download the mod in Elden Ring titled "memories"...

This is the end of the road for me...Goodbye.

 

When I was a child, my mother always told me “Monsters aren’t real, they can’t hurt you.” but how wrong she was. After her passing, my father became distraught. He would stop hanging out with his friends and barely leave the house. He would typically fall asleep in his chair with a beer can in his hand. But that’s when it started. The knocking on my window.

Every night between midnight and one, there would always be a knock. Every time I called my dad to my room, the knocking would stop, and he’d get furious, thinking I was playing a ‘prank’ on him. It started getting worse as the days went on. It wasn’t my window anymore, but now it was my closet. Randomly in the middle of the night, the door would open. 

Every time it happened, I would hide under my blankets and pray to God that it’d go away. But every morning I’d look at my closet and the door would be shut like it never happened. One night when the closet door opened, I saw a dark figure emerge. I couldn’t help but scream. 

After a few seconds, I heard my father drunkenly make his way up the stairs and towards my room. But this time, the monster didn’t go away when he opened the door. “What the fuck?” he said, slurring his words. In a heartbeat, he was pulled into the closet by the monster. I jumped out of bed and ran out of my room. 

I could hear my father scream as I ran down the stairs. After running out of my house, I ran to my father's ex-friend's house, and he called the police. The next thing I knew, I was questioned once they found the body, and I was living with my aunt. 

A few decades later, I now have a wife and a daughter. Life went on as normal. We had breakfast, and I drove her to school. Once home, my wife and I got into an argument about who would do the laundry. 

But later that night that’s when my daughter said the words I wished to never hear “Dad, there’s knocking at my window.” My heart jumped. “What did you just say?” I said, raising my voice a little. I rushed into her room and flung the curtains open. Nothing but darkness. The knocking stopped just like when I was a kid. The next morning, I was still stressed about it. My wife would ask me what’s wrong, and I’d only reply with “Nothing, honey.” After dropping my daughter off at school, I researched what I had experienced as a kid. But I found nothing. A week later, my daughter said there was a monster in the closet.

Later at night, before she went to bed, I set up a light in her closet and left the door open, and put a camera facing the closet. In the morning, I collected the camera and fast-forwarded the footage. Shortly after I left, the light in the closet started flickering, then the camera shut off. When I picked up my daughter from school, I told her she can sleep with us tonight. 

But even in our room, the closet door opened. I looked over and saw my daughter and wife sleeping. Just like I did as a kid, I closed my eyes and pulled the covers over my face. But then the whispering started. It sounded like a million voices all whispering in your ears at once. 

I flung the covers off me and shouted towards the closet “Leave us alone!” the light next to the bed turned on and my wife said “Honey are you alright?” the closet door was now shut. “Yeah,” I said before turning over and trying to sleep. The next morning was the same. But at night, the whispering started again. I woke up in the middle of the night. 

I looked over to my right and saw my wife wasn’t in bed. Turning on the light and looking around the room, I saw the bedroom door was open and so was the closet door. I rushed out of the room and went into my daughter's room, turning on the light. She wasn’t in there either. I quickly rushed down the stairs and saw something in the kitchen. 

It was tall with long fingers and had pale skin. Without thinking, I ran and grabbed a kitchen knife on the counter and stabbed the monster in its stomach over and over. It smiled at me, showing rows of razor-sharp teeth. A few seconds later, I passed out. I opened my eyes and panicked, seeing blood on my left hand, thinking it was mine. The only thing on my mind was finding my wife and daughter. My right hand still held the knife and there was blood on it. Turning around, I saw my wife and daughter’s bodies with stab wounds on them. A tear fell from my eye as I dropped the knife.

If your kid ever tells you about knocking on their window in the middle of the night, just let the monster kill you as it did to your father so your family will live.

There are several rules I have to follow inside The Neverwood Facility For Young Monsters, or I will be executed on the spot.

Here is a copy of the list I have on my wall:

1)  I must eat all human food on my plate inside the cafeteria (including my vegetables) or I am not allowed inside the feeding room.

2) I must attend group therapy every day at the allocated time or forfeit meals for a week.

3) I must attend one-to-one sessions with my therapist.

4) I must not bite, eat, drain the soul or kill my therapist.

5) I must not ask my therapist private questions such as: “Do my remaining family think I’m dead?” or “Did you catch our creator yet?”

6) I must not leave my cell under any circumstances or risk being executed or forcibly restrained by awaiting guards.

7) I must be polite to my fellow patients.

8) I must not start fights with my fellow patients.

9)  I must not look in reflective surfaces. If I do, I forfeit luxuries such as internet usage and access inside the feeding room.

10) I must not engage in conversation with CELL NUMBER 405 also Frankie. He is still considered a CODE BLACK.

11) If I am to let go of my humanity and embrace the full shift, I have consented to be executed immediately.

12) I must not make contact with my creator.

... 

I woke up suffocating.

Entangled.

In my mind, I was both nothing and nobody. Thoughts disjointed. I couldn’t think. When I tried, there was nothing but blur and confusion, and a vague sense of dread creeping up on me. I felt nothing but… cold. Heavy. Like there was something on my chest squeezing the air from my lungs while ice seeped into bones I couldn’t even feel. Limbs which felt wrong. It was so fucking cold. I was so cold, but I couldn’t understand why. My body was cold, my brain. My thoughts. 

It took me a while to gather myself, but even that wasn’t enough. I was surrounded by white when I managed to pry my eyes open. Sterile white. My head was against icy porcelain. Bathtub. The word trickled ever so slowly into my sticky-syrup brain. I was in a bathtub. But there was no water. Instead of water, I was enveloped in something slithery and warm. I could feel it wet against my own body.

I was covered in it, painted in this thing which was more physical than water but was still managing to pull me under like a vicious current. Drowning me. When my brain started to kick into gear, I became more aware of my surroundings as choking fog started to clear. I already had an inkling what it was that I was drowning in when I woke up, but I didn’t even want to entertain the thought. 

Now my eyes were open, and I was seeing blurs of something covering me, piled on top of me, masses of unmoving grey lying on my chest—I realised what it was I was submerged in. I tried to move, tried to open my mouth to scream, but they were crushing my lungs. I couldn’t move. 

My body was a dead weight. Panic struck. It was cruel and cutting, forcing my body into some kind of reaction. But I was paralysed. “I can’t move.” I heard my voice but it was an echo, and I was struck with the overwhelming sense of Déjà vu. This had happened before. I’d already experienced all of these feelings, all of this panic eating me up, this pain slicing into me like knives.

“I… I can’t move.” I say it again, louder.

“What can you see, Ren?”

My therapist’s voice cuts through the memory, and it’s comforting enough to use as an anchor. I held onto it with everything I had.

“I can see… white.” I whispered, trying to stay calm. “I can see white, and I can’t… I can’t move.” I knew what I couldn’t do. I couldn’t look down at myself. I couldn’t look at reflective surfaces—and most importantly… no matter how strong the urge was, I couldn’t look for her. Because I knew where she was. I knew what she was. I had already been in that bathtub.

I had already suffocated in slithering masses of weight trying to plunge me into the dark. It was supposed to be hypnotherapy, a way to travel back to the root of my trauma and explore it. Relive it. Try and overcome it. But the deeper I had slipped inside my own mind, old thoughts were blossoming back into fruition. Human thoughts. Human emotions. I had to find her. As soon as the thought entered my mind, I was already searching through blinding white. I was trying to heave my unresponsive body through the masses of something suffocating me, trying and failing to push down a feeling which was slowly taking me over, creeping inside every piece of me and bleeding into my brain. Every instinct I had was fighting to recoil back from the memory, but I held on, forcing myself further inside my past selves’ thoughts and feelings which already slamming into me like waves.

I already knew.

Part of me knew where she was—and yet I was still looking for her.

“Ren, I thought I was very clear,” My therapist’s voice hardened. “Do not look down at yourself. I want you to focus on your surroundings and four senses. What do you see, hmm? You told me you see white. Can you see beyond that? How about feeling? Can you hear anything?”

Her words were like a whisper in the wind in my hurricane thoughts.

“But… my arm.” I couldn’t resist spluttering the words out in a choked cry. “I have to.. I have to see…”

I have to see if it’s real, I thought.

If what I saw way back then was real—and if it was.. could I stop it? Could I stop it from happening?

“Focus.” My therapist said. “Tell me about what you can see. Just start small,” her tone softened. “Come on, sweetheart. You can do this.”

Swallowing down  a cry clawing at my throat, I pushed myself to keep going. “I’m in a bathroom.” I managed to choke out.

“A bathroom, hmm? And do you know this bathroom? Does it have meaning to you?”

Looking past what it was I was buried in, my gaze flicked to white tiles where cringy feel good quotes were stuck to the wall. I glimpsed a rubber duck sitting on the edge of the tub, tiny bottles of shampoo and shower gel, a bright pink hair scrunchie wrapped around the silver tap. When I tried to move my body, to lean forward and grab the scrunchie, I couldn’t. I was still drowning. I was still suffocating in… in them.

I could feel my eyes stinging, a sob heaving in my chest and building in my throat threatening to rip from my teeth. “It’s… it’s home.”

“Your parents’ home?”

“I don’t have any parents.” I gritted out.

“Then what does this home mean to you? Is it a sense of independence without parental figures?”

“No.” I said, “It’s… just home. I feel safe here. I have people I care about here.”

She hummed, and I could feel her fingers loosening the velcro straps pinning me down. In the real world, I was inside a room with four grey walls, a blinding light shining down on my face as I lay on a metal slab like a piece of meat ready for slaughter. I would have preferred it if I was going to die. At least I wouldn’t have to live through this again. Slowly, splinters of real life started to come through. I could sense my bed reclining, and the low hum of the machine taking readings of my brain. If I fully concentrated, I was able to feel both reality and memory at the same time. I could feel the ice cold porcelain of the bathtub in my memory, as well as the strange metallic headset which had been placed on top of my head in reality. 

My therapist was one of the nicer humans who came to visit. I liked to think she actually had empathy outside of her professional façade. Though maybe I was just naïve and craved someone I could actually talk to. Holding my breath, I didn’t think about the velcro strapping me down, or the uncomfortable device digging into the back of my skull. I concentrated on the memory. But doing so only plunged me deeper inside. I was paralysed. I couldn’t fucking move and no matter what I did, I couldn’t force my body into fruition. 

A sudden sharp knock on the door jolted my body against the restraints, and several different gloved hands were suddenly holding me down. They wanted to me to see it all again. I was told it would just be the start—it would just be before I opened the door. Before I saw him.  I shook my head rapidly, my lips moving but no sound coming out. I want to stop, I thought hysterically. I want to stop. I want to stop! My therapist’s hands were stroking the back of my head. She was firm, tightening the screw holding the headset in place.

A muffled cry outside the door in the memory sent icy slithers down my spine, and I felt three separate pairs of hands struggling to pin me down in sputters of reality bleeding inside me.

“Ren? Dude, let me in! Are you in there?!”

Another knock. This time I felt it reverberating in my bones.

BANG. BANG. BANG.

Wood splintered.

“Ren! Open the door!”

His voice was so familiar. I felt my head sliding on cold porcelain, lazy eyes flicking to the door.

“I can hear Johnny.” I said through panicked breaths, my body stiffening under the bindings.

“I can hear him… he’s trying… he’s trying to get in.”

“Ren, I want you to stay calm, okay? It’s not real. It’s just a memory—"

Johnny’s voice enveloped the rest of her soothing murmur.

“Please! I think there’s something wrong with me! I can’t… I can’t think straight! There’s something going on downstairs!”

BANG. BANG. BANG.

Johnny’s voice morphed into an animalistic hiss. “…He’s gone mad, Ren. Do you fucking hear me? He’s gone mad!”

The door was almost off its hinges, and something inside me snapped. I felt my body writhing, my lips curling into a feral snarl. Whatever had been holding me back, stopping me from smelling them—smelling that aroma which drove me fucking insane, came apart. I’ve heard of special spray the human’s douse themselves in before they come near us.

It dulls their scent  usually, but this time the spray must have worn off. Sucking in deep breathe of air as I struggled to claw my way through a brewing panic attack, I got a whiff of it straight away. It was like cocaine and heroin mixed together, an intoxicating mix in the air which sent my brain into overdrive. I could sense it suddenly. 

It was everywhere. I could smell coffee on their breath, spatters of lunch and cigarettes and sex dripping from them. Bringing it all together was petrichor which must have come in stuck to the bottom of their shoes and fibres of clothing. The smell of the air before rainfall. The smell of home before the storm. It was everything I used to have. It was life, the smell of the outside and humanity, stuck to them.  All of it hitting me at once was enough to pull me from my memory. When my physical self sat up, and I was ripped from my own mind, I was blinking at three shadows staring down at me. I was panting, choking on my own breaths. I was well aware of my stance, my fingernails scratching the table, my teeth on wicked display. Basking in sickly pale light, the shadow’s looming over me looked startled. Their eyes were frightened.

I’d torn out of my restraints. Just a glance to the left, and I’d ripped through velcro designed me hold me down.

My therapist was among the shadows. Instead of getting angry, her eyes were sincere. I wondered if she was smiling under her mask.

“You’re doing so well, Ren.” My therapist said, her voice muffled. I relaxed under her gentle touch, pushing me back onto the bed.

“Just a little more, okay?” Her words were breathy, panicky, as she redid my restraints and hastily fixed the headset back in place.

 She was scared of me.

They were all scared of me.

Blinking into intense white light, I felt exposed under their eyes. I felt disgusting. Inhuman.

They stunk, and I hated that they smelled of everything I wanted back.

Some shadows left the room while others stayed with their arms folded, staring at me like I was a lab experiment.

“You’re okay.” I didn’t know my therapist’s name, though her official name was Doctor Malia. Her voice was soothing as I slowly sunk back into the memory. “We’re going to try one more time, okay? I want you to tell me how you’re feeling. Then we will stop the exercise.”

Johnny’s cries grew muffled like he was shouting into a void.

The door continued to tremble, and I felt myself slip further into the tub.

“I’m suffocating,” I said through sharp heavy breaths teetering on the edge of hysteria. And I was. I was slipping deeper and deeper into masses of ripped clothing and slimy skin which had been dead for hours. Days. Maybe weeks. Severed limbs and heads with no torso’s.

I was somehow alive, and they were dead.

“That is a well-known side effect among Newborns,” Doctor Malia said. “It’s an incredibly overwhelming experience.”

“No, I mean I’m suffocating.” I hissed out, trying to force myself from the pile and breathe real air. “I can’t… I can’t breathe.”

“Is it water? Is the tub filling up?”

I was sure she could see everything I could through the device. Her question was pushing me to accept my surroundings. My eyes snapped to the writing on the wall, smears of scarlet my brain couldn’t untangle into cohesive words.

“No,” I forced the words out. “It’s not water.”

“Then what is it, Ren?”

I had to think about my answer for a second.

What was I drowning in?

Slimy skin pressed to my own, clothes drenched in sharp, intense red and hair tickling my neck from dozens of decapitated heads.

“Flesh.” I said, my voice rising. “I’m…. I’m suffocating… in flesh.”

“Keep going.” Her tone was pushing me further over the edge. “Who are they, Ren?”

“Them.” I spluttered. “I’m covered in them. I’m drowning… I’m fucking drowning in them!”

For a moment, I was neither in memory nor reality. I was somewhere else entirely.

I saw slivers of silver descending down on me, razor sharp edges slicing into my flesh.

I was screaming.

Before the blades cut through my vocal chords.

Zigzagging sparks showering the air was the last thing I saw before I yanked myself from whatever that was.

Something warm ran from my nose, tainting my lips and dribbling down my chin.

Doctor Malia felt close. Her breath tickled my cheeks.

“Can you explain to me what you’re seeing, honey?”

“Doctor Malia, the patient is experiencing pressure on the brain,” a far away voice murmured.

“I’m aware of that,” she hissed back. “Keep going. We can go deeper. Come on, Ren. This is further when we’ve ever gotten!”

I coughed this time, rivulets of something wetting my lips. “Let me go.” I pulled on my restraints. “I want to stop. Now.”

“Push through it.” Doctor Malia ordered. I could hear her murmuring to orderlies, but their voices were entangled.

“Take me back to the beginning.” She said, when a dull pain arched its way across the back of my head.

“Doctor Malia, if the body is showing signs of rejection—”

She cut the orderly off. “He’s fine!” And then to me, “You’ve gotten this far. Now explore what you’ve been afraid to accept.”

My response was a moan. “No…” I tossed back and forth on the bed trying to shake off the device which was glued to my head.

But despite my protests, I was already falling.

Plunging.

Deep, deep, down.

Reality was slipping away, along with Doctor Malia’s voice and my own writhing limbs rejecting the memory dive.

“Ren?” Johnny’s muffled cries were back, but they were getting louder and louder until it felt like he was screaming into my ear.

“Please let me in. I’m so… I’m so hungry,” He was crying, his words disjointed, but something feral, something monstrous was brewing.

“I think I hurt Mina. I mean, I did. I fucking killed her.”

A hand slick scarlet pulverised splintered wood.

His hysterical laugh vibrated with the door as he forced his weight into it.

“I killed her!” He wailed, his hand snaking through the gap. “I killed her, and she’s just down the hall, Ren! She’s waiting for you!”

When the door was knocked off its hinges, my brain detached itself from the memory and bled into another. Johnny’s voice followed like a parasite.

Until it wasn’t just in my head. It wasn’t just a memory.

He was there. Right in front of me. I wasn’t in a bathtub anymore. I was in our kitchen. I came to at the back end of a Panic! At The Disco song playing on the Alexa. Johnny, a fellow resident of Shelley House was sitting in front of me typing on his laptop with one hand and stuffing himself with pizza with the other. It was hard to miss him. How could I not see that annoyingly bright red hair poking from his ratty baseball cap? His college letterman hangs awkwardly off one shoulder. 

Johnny’s gaze was still on the screen as he typed manically. Probably an essay he’d forgotten to write. “I said,” Johnny spoke through a mouthful of tomato and cheese mush, shooting me a look over his MacBook, “It’s vegan. Like, actual vegan pizza.” He held the pizza like it was a lab specimen, pointing at its base. “See? Even the peperoni.”

I grabbed a slice and took a bite. Huh. It didn’t taste like pizza, per say. But it was good enough.

“Is this from the health food store?”  Taking another bite, I savoured fake string cheese which actually tasted like cheese.

“Nah, it’s Pizza Hut.” Johnny dangled another slice in my face. “It’s good, right? I didn’t think I could go vegan but now I’m considering it.”

I shrugged, swallowing another bite.  “Isn’t the food pricey? It’s like three bucks for oat milk.”

Johnny turned back to his laptop screen. “I guess? But so is vegetarian food, and I’ve survived.”

“Why did you go vegetarian again?” Mina, housemate number two, sat next to him with her head buried in her arms.

Johnny settled her with his usual teasing smirk. “I’ve been a vegetarian since I was fourteen. Why are you asking me now?”

Helping myself to another slice of pizza, I nodded, trying to avoid looking at my phone which was yet to light up with a notification. Lizbeth was in class, I knew that. It was our final year and things were crazy but she hadn’t responded since this morning. Still though, I wasn’t overly worried. She had a habit of turning off her phone and ignoring it for work. I just told myself to stop being paranoid.  "I second that.”

Mina didn’t lift her head. “Because I’m bored,” she mumbled into the table. “And I know once you start talking you won’t shut up.”

Johnny shrugged. “I like animals.”

She made a scoffing noise. “Weren’t you manically laughing at some YouTuber killing horses in a Skyrim mod a few days ago?”

He rolled his eyes. “That’s Skyrim! Of course I’m going to laugh at it.”

When Mina finally lifted her head, the girl looked half dead. Her dark blonde hair was a mess of curls and she looked like she hadn’t slept in… ever. She leaned close to Johnny, so uncomfortably close he inched away from her with wide eyes. Mina was scary when she hadn’t slept. “You were scarred for life by one of those documentaries we were all shown as kids. I had a kid in my class who fainted halfway through.” Mina sat up straight and held up a finger. “Exhibit A: Your great aunt was a meat eater when she came to visit before summer.”

Johnny cocked a brow. “Wait, what is this, Sherlock Holmes?”

She ignored him. And I was all for their little argument. That was what the kitchen was for after all. Mina held up a second finger. “Exhibit B: In your kid photos on your aunt’s Facebook, specifically one from when you were sixteen, you are eating a chilli dog at her summer BBQ.”

Johnny looked… impressed. Maybe a little scared.

He turned to her with wide eyes. “Wait, you have my great aunt on Facebook?”

“Everyone does!” Mina’s lips broke out into a smile, “At this point you’re like our brother.”

“Brother?” I caught her words. “Wouldn’t that be…”

Mina grabbed the closest thing to her and held it up like a weapon. A towel. “Finish that sentence and you’re dead.”

As usual, Johnny hadn’t gotten my joke. I think he was still trying to process that Mina had his great aunt on Facebook.

“I’m one year younger!” He was starting to get pissed. Not proper pissed. Johnny pissed. Which was smiling way more than usual, his voice going a few octaves higher. When Mina burst out laughing, he shoved her playfully with a scowl. “Fine. You win. I watched Cowspiracy.”

Mina pulled a face. “Urgh. The worst one.”

I shot her a look. “I’m sorry, are you saying there are good documentaries about animal slaughter?”

“Informative and depressing? Yes.” Mina stood up, strode towards the refrigerator and pulled out a soda. “Good? I’m going to say no. Unless you like gore.”

“Speaking of gore,” Johnny finished up the pizza and shut his laptop lid, leaning his chin on his fist. “Where’s the Halloween committee? I thought we were having our annual party.”

“Halloween committee.” I repeated in a scoff. My phone lit up and my heart did a leap. But it was just Uber Eats spam. “You mean Frankie.”

I noticed a tinge of red blossoming across his cheeks.

“He asked me to help him grab decorations from Target this morning, but I said I was busy.”

“Busy.” Mina rolled her eyes. “On a Saturday.”

Yeah, I found that hard to believe. Especially when Johnny’s idea of “busy” was playing GTA until 4am.

It had been a week.

One week since the two had drunkenly slept with Mina, the three of them in a strange threesome sandwich, and not one of them wanted to talk about it. Every time I tried to bring it up with them, they acted as maturely as 24 year olds would act. They stuck their fingers in their ears and walked away, sometimes yelling LALALALALALAALA I’M NOT LISTENINGGGGGG. Like we were in fifth grade. All three of them drove me crazy and  had done since I moved into Shelly House during my freshman year of college. It wasn’t quite college dorms. 

It was the cheaper option, a boarding house on the edge of campus which we had collectively bought off of the owner. It was a halfway house of sorts, for kids (or adults) who weren’t quite sure what the fuck they were doing with their lives. 

Shelley House was a Victorian wet dream. It was kind of rundown and the walls were covered in mould, the shower didn’t work and we had a yearly infestation of rats every Fall—but it was our home. Johnny and Frankie had a thing a few months back, followed by Mina and Johnny, and then Frankie and Mina. In the end, I guess they said fuck it and went poly. But nothing had really happened since that night except awkward conversation which was hard to endure and the three of them being both stubborn as well as collectively sharing one—no, half a brain cell. I got it. Friends becoming something else was definitely weird, but it’s not like I hadn’t caught onto the fact that Johnny and Mina were in love with Frankie. And vice versa, I guessed.

Johnny was quick to cut into the awkward silence. “I probably should have helped him.”

“Well, yeah.” Mina  plonked herself back at the table, Coke in hand, nursing the can. “He’s the only one who actually wants to do the whole party thing this year. Because it’s Frankie. And Frankie will literally do anything to avoid doing actual work, while he still gets amazing grades,” Mina caught herself. “That’s not the point, however. As much as I want to rant about how much I think the man is actually blessed by an angel, I’m not too sure about a party this year.” She took a hesitant sip, savouring the drink. “Aren’t we a little old? Freshman throw them.”

“Hey, mid-twenties is still young.” Johnny leaned back in his chair. “Twenty five is the best age to be immortal.”

Mina choked on her soda. “You’re confusing 25 with 21, idiot.” she shot him a grin. “You know, Forever Twenty one? It’s literally a store.”

“The desired age has moved over the years.” Johnny said. Leaning further back in his chair, he almost tumbled over. I caught the moment of panic flash in his eyes when he realised he’d swung too hard. “Twenty one is the new eighteen. Everyone knows that. Twenty five is true alpha age. Everyone wants to be 25. It’s where you can still be lost even as an adult and folks can’t get on your ass about having no life.”

I threw our youngest housemate a look. “Sounds like you’re desperately trying to convince yourself you still have your youth, man.”

Johnny threw a piece of pepperoni at me. “I do have my youth!”

Johnny and Mina’s back and forth carried on while I scanned my phone notifications for a text from Lizbeth. Still nothing. I was considering ringing her when the floor flew open, and in stumbled my third and final Shelly housemate. Frankie. Who was weighed down with three bags he was struggling to keep from slipping from his grasp before he finally caved and dropped them onto the kitchen floor. The guy was out of breath, panting, seemingly trying to coerce words and failing before he grabbed a lukewarm beer from the countertop, cracked it open and took a long swig. I could see what the other two saw in Frankie. Dark brown curls pinned back with a pair of raybans, a strong jawline and glittering eyes. He was the human embodiment of a golden retriever. 

Frankie was already in his costume. I was still trying to figure out what it was, a wonky headband with a bright green triangle attached to it. “Yeah, don’t help me or anything! I’m good!” he said sarcastically. His British accent was refreshing in a room full of Americans. But his tone didn’t match the stupid grin on his face which I swore was permanent. Frankie was smiling until his gaze found the dirty plates piled in the sink. I had meant to wash them up earlier, I just forgot.

“Ren, dude.” Frankie groaned. “You were supposed to wash the dishes!”

“I’ll do them later.” I said, more interested in the bags. The others were already delving into them, getting tangled in fake spiderwebs.

"Are these Halloween decorations?" Johnny pulled out a scream mask with mishappen eyes.

"Yep!" Frankie folded his arms like a proud father.

"But these..."

Mina picked up a pair of gummy fangs and tossed them to Johnny who struggled to lodge them into his mouth. "This is what you got?"

Frankie scowled. "I'm sorry, did you drive halfway across town with a bust radio only for the Halloween section at Target to be empty? This is all they had. The rest I grabbed from a store just down the road. Howard Jekyll, or something like that. The dude had some cool shit.”

Amongst badly made masks and glowing silly string, there were several stick-on posters each with a cringey quote.

I held up one with, ‘LAB EXPERIMENTS IN PROGRESS! I MUST MAKE THE PERFECT HUMAN.’ In spooky red letters.

“You’ve outdone yourself,” I chuckled. “This is scary. Like, people are going to shit their pants when they see this.”

Frankie shrugged. “They’re just for added dec. I figured they’d spice up the place a little,” he lips curved. “Ironically, of course.”

“I think they’re cute.” Mina was smiling at the other posters, flipping through them. I saw one for a mummy, a vampire, and a crime scene.

“Cute?” Johnny spat out the gummy fangs. We’re going to be laughed at!”

“Shh.” Mina held them up. “We can put these around the house! It’ll be like a spooky quote people can read before they enter a room,” she jumped to her feet with way too much energy. “I’m going to try find a costume. I should have something black. Oooh, should I be a ghost?”

Turning to Frankie, Mina poked his headband. “What are you supposed to be again?”

“A Sim.” He flicked the green triangle. “For the lack of effort I put into it, I think it’s awesome.”

“What is this supposed to be?” Johnny held up a poster and prodded the monster's face. “That’s not a vampire.”

“Then what is it?” Mina challenged.

“I don’t know! But look at the marks on its face! What even is that?”

“Fascinating!” Frankie pulled the poster off him. “We should probably get ready for this party."

When the others started to decorate the house, I made my way up to my room. Lizbeth had texted me saying she was arriving in around an hour, so I hurried to wash up and pull on a decent shirt. 

I was standing in front of my mirror frowning at my reflection and trying to tame my hair before everything turned… cold. It started like a bad feeling creeping up my spine, dread curling in gut—but expanded to my chest and throat. I couldn’t breathe suddenly. When I tried to, sucking in sharp breaths, the air was turning white in front of me. I was paralysed suddenly, my body stiff while my brain knocked around in my skull. Something was in the around me. I could see it at the corner of my eye seeping through the gap in my door; a dull green mist-like fog growing thicker before darkness swallowed me up and I plunged deep down.

During my unravelling, I awoke twice.

Once, right before my first death—and then again. In the bathtub.

The first time was… strange. I felt weirdly giddy like I was hopped up on drugs. I woke to the sound of grinding blades inches from my face and singing. Loud singing. Hysterical singing. Screaming. Screams like I’d never heard before. 

Agonising wails I wanted to block out as soon as they slithered into my skull when I slipped back into consciousness. I was aware of two things when I struggled to take in my surroundings. The figure looming over me was someone I knew, someone I cared about—and that figure was painted in red. Like he was its canvas, like he spoke for the colour. It wasn’t just him. Everything was blurred and strange and foggy, and definitely bloody. It dripped from the walls, from our kitchen table I was lying on. Even the ceiling. There was something… very wrong with our kitchen. 

There was too much silver where there was supposed to be rustic wallpaper. Supposed to be Johnny’s drink’s cabinet, our bookcase full of classics we never read, and board games.

Instead, I was seeing… metal. It was everywhere, like the room had been converted into something horrific, something from my nightmares. My capturers face was a blur in my mind. Maybe I already knew it but I was in denial. The looming figure was the one singing, the one laughing and dancing, twirling around, snatching up masses of flesh with fingers which were still twitching, eyes which still blinked, and throwing them onto the table. I wasn’t tied down. But I didn’t have to be. The spinning wheel of silver blades hanging inches from my face was enough to stiffen me in place and choke the cry building in my throat as the shadow leaned in close. In his hand was a sharpie. And with a grin stretched across his lips and a sparkle in his eye, he began to mark something across my forehead, and then right into my hairline.

Where were the screams coming from? Was the only thought dominating my brain, as the figure above me traced his finger across the markings on my forehead. They were everywhere. They were behind me, in front of me, to my left and right. Up above and down below. They were in the walls, crying, screeching, wailing with the type of pain I didn’t understand. But when I did manage to catch sight of something, a writhing mass of flesh to my right, a pile of bodies stacked high with party guests whose parts had been mixed and matched, stitched and cut and patched together like they were dolls. But their heads, whether they were connected to a torso or not, were still screaming. Something sparked in the air above me.

I could see it, sharp rivulets of electricity flickering to life. I didn’t have time to see what it was, to understand. Because my capturer’s laugh was growing more and more hysterical, and he was muttering to himself, giggling, his hands wet and warm grazing my cheeks and face—before the spinning blades started again. This time they didn’t just spin, transfixing me with how fast they were, the silver began to descend, cruel, cutting blades getting closer and closer until they were grazing the flesh of my neck. I remember crying out. Before his hands were appearing wielding instruments with edges like carving knives. He didn’t cut with them, instead using them to guide the spinning blades. When they touched down, I was already dead. It happened in the blink of an eye. One minute I was staring up at a monstrous machine primed to disembowel me, and then my world went silent. 

The horrific grinding sound of the spinning blades, and the guy’s laughing. 

Everything stopped. 

A nightmare. That was what my first thought. My eyes flickered open. For a moment, I didn’t think about the flesh suffocating me. I didn’t think about headless bodies and wrangled guts spilled out around me, a wave of red lapping my knees. Instead, my gaze flashed downwards. The first thing I saw were stars. I was seeing stars speckled across an arm which was attached to me, wedged against the side of the tub. I knew those stars. I had been there when she’d gotten them, when she had hauled herself onto the chair with a bright smile, chewing her lip and tapping her feet and insisting that she was totally not scared of needles. 

Constellations. Lizbeth wanted a sleeve of them dotting her skin and marking our relationship like it was some star crossed lovers shit. It didn’t make sense to me why Lizbeth’s tattoo’s were on my arm. When I realised I could move my body a little, I held it up and waved the arm. It was definitely mine. I could move it. I could scrunch up my fingers and make a fist. So, how did I have my girlfriend’s tattoo?  

“Ren?” Johnny’s voice made me jump.

My mouth wouldn’t sound out words properly, my voice barely a hiss. It sounded more like, "Jornnnnathooonnnn?"

…”He’s gone mad, Ren! Do you fucking hear me? He’s gone mad!”

It was then when I noticed the writing on the wall in startling claret:

BAD BATCH (NUMBER 2) FAILURES.

That was what the people were—the people entangled with me. Heads and torso’s, arms and legs.

They were failures.

Struggling through the masses of flesh, I tried to haul myself from the tub.

“Please let me in,” he whispered. “I’m so hungry. I think I hurt Mina. I mean, I know I did. I fucking killed her.”

His hysterical laugh vibrated with the door as he forced his weight into it.

“I killed her!” He wailed, his hand snaking through the gap. “I killed her, and she’s just down the hall, Ren! She’s waiting for you!”

When the door flew off its hinges, I managed to pull myself out of the tub before Johnny could force his way in.

But he didn’t have to.

Footsteps.

The door, while being completely broken off its hinge thankfully still blocked the archway.

“Fran?” Johnny’s voice became a snarl. I could sense razor sharp teeth. “Fran, what the fuck?”

The footsteps thudded closer before the cracking sound so horrific I had to plant my hands over my ears.

Johnny’s body dropped to the ground.

I didn’t see it but I heard it.


When I risked a peek through the door, I saw a blur of mismatched flesh and patchwork body parts. Like a doll, but it wasn’t different clothes I was seeing. I was seeing different patches of skin. Light, dark, tanned and pasty white. I saw different eyes forced into sockets and ugly stitches rutted across what was left my housemate’s neck. Nothing I could see Frankie, except maybe his torso and parts of his head. Everything else had been replaced. His right eye was backwards, the pupil zeroing in on me while his left eye was looking a whole different direction.

In his arms, bridle style, was Johnny. Who was yet to be disremembered and put back together again. Though there was a glaring difference in my friend hanging from Frankie’s arms. Johnny’s face was covered in strange vine like black markings, like something was writhing in his blood, spiderwebbing across his cheeks and forehead. It reminded me of something. I’d seen it before, and it was driving me mad. Frankie paid no attention to me. He turned around with Johnny dangling in his arms and walked back down the hallway. I thought about following him before steeling myself. 

I had to get downstairs and get the cops. I waited until he’d carried Johnny downstairs before forcing myself into a power-walk—but the closer I was getting to the kitchen, I could hear that noise again. Grinding blades. Strangled screams. I was grabbing the handle of the kitchen door when I noticed the  Halloween poster from earlier. Frankie had taped it to the door.

LAB EXPERIMENTS IN PROGRESS! I MUST MAKE THE PERFECT HUMAN.

And then I remembered the posters on the other’s doors.

Johnny’s face, those markings under his eyes.

His strength when he forced himself through the bathroom door.

Something warm was slithering up my throat, but I was already doing what I wasn’t allowed to do. What I had promised myself not to do under any circumstances. Because I already knew once waking up. Once seeing Lizbeth’s tattoos covering my arm, the beginning of our relationship marked in constellations spanning across her upper arm and shoulder. When I pulled back a shirt sleeve which wasn’t mine, I was seeing Lizbeth’s tattoo. But I was also looking down at my own body, at how my leg looked odd next to my other one, and my stomach was a lot rounder than I remembered. When I clawed at my hair, most of it was gone, a large bald patch and stitches running down my hairline. 

They were everywhere. Stitches. They were in my hands and on my arms and my fingers, across my gut when I lifted my shirt with trembling fingers. My skin was thousands of shades, like had sliced me up and taken care of each piece, stitching me back together. I wasn’t just Lizbeth. I was a piece of every person which made me up. I was all of them and none of me. Did any part me still exist? I got my answer when I forced my way into our kitchen which had been converted into a freakish laboratory which could only exist with some kind of inhuman force. Because there was no way Frankie could build all of this. When I stepped inside, I saw what was left of Johnny under the spinning blades. I finally understood what my housemate was trying to do. I was a failure of its practise, and it looked like Johnny would be a success.

Johnny was in one piece before the world around me exploded.

I remember him strapped down, struggling, snarling, pitch dark eyes brewing with something inhuman.

Mina was on the pile of screaming body parts, her skin had been ripped into shreds and wrapped around her like a—

Like a mummy.

The perfect human’s, I thought, glimpsing pieces of my own body I recognised.

When lightning struck the metal rod piercing Johnny’s body, men and women in white were suddenly pouring inside the house.

Something shot Frankie, and he dropped to the ground.

“Detecting high levels of G6! This place is doused in the stuff!”

"Check everything. Especially Halloween decorations. That's the usual target."

"Time of shift?"

"Around 7 hours ago. Ten past midnight exactly. Holy fuck, we've got a bloodbath."

 A woman pointed a gun at my head, her lip curling in disgust. "Mid-twenties. Hybrid of some sort. Should I shoot?"

"They're all hybrids," a man grunted. "Howard Jekyll and his store have a lot to answer for. This is the second case in five years.”

"Meaning? Didn't we have a deal with him?"

"We did. It looks like he broke it."

"Bring them in." A voice through static. "I don't care what state they're in.”

"I don't think that's possible. These guys are code black hybrids. “I’m not talking vamps or wendigo’s. All of these people have been... altered."

"Altered?"

"Have you read Frankenstein? That seems to be the inspiration." A man had hold of Frankie. “This one needs to be sedated. Now.”

Someone knelt in front of me—and I realised behind her the clock had stopped. It had stopped just after midnight.

How did I never realise?

"Can you tell me your name?"

I thought of the tattoo on my-- no, her arm.

"Elizabeth."

"Okay, Elizabeth. This is going to hurt. I want you to hold your breath if you can and count to twenty. Can you do that for me?"

One.

Two.

Three.

Four.

"End the shift. Do it, now. They've suffered enough."

Five

Six.

Seven.

Eight.

"Are you sure?"

"Yes. The longer we leave it they'll find it harder to adapt."

Nine.

Ten

Eleven

Twelve.

The clock started to move again, the room filled with early morning sunlight and what I was finally hit me.

Along with a sudden scolding hunger.

I was a monster—a being made from patchwork flesh and discarded body parts.

I stopped counting.

And fucking screamed.

Hi! This is a short story that my little sister Isabelle (10 yrs.) wrote. It’s based off a dream she had a few months ago. I edited it to add dialogue, but she did most of the work. Enjoy!

So, one night me and my friend Eliza were having a sleepover and we decided to put some “haunted” stuff in a box. Nothing happened, so we went to bed.

A few hours later, after everyone had gone to sleep, we heard tapping from inside the box. It was loud enough that it woke us up and so we went to tell my mom. She came into the room and didn’t hear anything, so she thought that we were playing some sort of prank and sent us back to bed. She told us not to wake her up again because she had work tomorrow.

We went back to bed and shortly after we had fallen back asleep, we heard more tapping. We ignored it and it continued for a few more minutes until a loud bang resounded throughout the room. My brother burst out of the box screaming and lunging at Eliza attacking her. I ran out of the room as fast as I could, terror filling my body. I ran into the bathroom and locked the door. I listened to the sounds of Eliza’s screaming get quieter and quieter, and the sounds or crunching, slurping, and smacking grew louder and louder.

I stifled my cries as it grew quiet, praying that whatever was pretending to be my brother didn’t find me. I listened, as footsteps grew closer and closer to the bathroom.

Then, a black spot appeared through the door. It was no bigger than a pinprick. I watched in fear as the spot grew. After a few moments the spot was big enough for a small person to fit through. It was then that I saw something coming out of the spot. It was tall and gangly, with its skin pulled tight over its bones. However, the skin seemed to be melting off, turning into a thick, black, tar like substance.

I watched in terror as it started to crawl through the hole. Before it could get in, I grabbed a hairbrush and used it to try and break the glass of the small bathroom window. Just as I had broken the glass and was about to try and crawl out, a loud, high pitched staticky screaming filled the air. I covered my ears. It felt like my head was about to explode. Somehow, through all the noise, I was able to hear that thing’s breathing. Loud, raspy, animal panting. It took me a few moments before I realized that the screams belonged to Eliza, my mom, and my two older siblings.

I frantically tried to climb through the broken window as the thing entered the room.

But I was too late.

All I could do was sit in helplessness as it dragged me back into the room, and darkness filled my vision.

“Isa, Isa wake up! Isabelle wake up!”

I bolted upright gasping for air and crying. My mom had woken me up, she sat with me and calmed me down as I cried and told her all about the awful dream I had.

“It’s alright sweetie, come here” she said, hugging me tightly.

“Are you going to be okay for your sleepover with Eliza tonight honey?” she asked.

“Yeah mom, I’ll be fine.” I spoke.

Later that night, Eliza’s mom had dropped her off.

“Come on!” I said, “Let’s go play in my room!”

Several hours later, we were exhausted. We stayed up a lot later than we were supposed to.

“G’night Eliza” I mumbled.

“Night Isa” Eliza whispered back.

As I drifted off to sleep, I could hear faint tapping in the background….

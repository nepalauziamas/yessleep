I'm not lying when I say that. I *was* given ten million dollars this morning. 

The bookstore was quiet, not the booking reading type of quiet, but the noone there type. My nose was in a Dream Koontz book when the man approached me. 

He glanced around, and I had the time to check him out. His dark suit was nearly pressed, the same as the shirt underneath it, with a startling blue tie finishing his crisp look. 

"No one reads anymore, do they?" He said in a crisp English accent, bringing his bald head back toward me. 

"Not really," I groaned, leaning off the counter. "Ebooks killed that market a long time ago, but I still like the feel of paper in my hands." I said, picking up the battered book I was reading. 

The customer looked at me again, his eyes, one blue and the other was an amber mix, studied me intently. 

"Do you like these kinds of books?" He picked up *The Silent Corner.* 

"Sure, I like horrors, but if you read as much as me, nothing can really scare you anymore. I like action adventures if I'm honest."

The man mulled this over with a pursed lip. "Are you a family man, Mr…?"

"O'Neil, Tom O'Neil. And yes, I am. Son. Six years old," I nodded, thinking about Tom junior. 

"Does your son enjoy books?"

I shook my head. "Na, Lego. Can't get enough of the stuff, but do you know how expensive that shit is? I could bust my balls here and only get a small box at the end of a paycheck." I said, pulling at my crinkled t-shirt. 

"Ah, Lego," the man replied, his non-existent eyebrows raised up, pulling his face taut, and his mouth formed a small O. "The building block," he mimed, placing one on top of the other. 

"Yeah, those little bricks," I followed suit doing the same hand gestures. 

"How charming. And your wife? Is Tanya happy that you can't afford to buy young Thomas Lego?" 

"I mean, not really… wait? How do you know my wife's name? Who are you?" 

I was suddenly alert. 

"I know quite a bit about you Mr O'Neil. Like how you sit in your garden shed of a night pursuing that lost passion of yours. How you feel that you are just existing now you're forty. How you long to be one of those characters in the books you enjoy."

"Now hold a goddamn minute here, buster. I don't know who you are but…" 

"No. It's you who needs to wait a minute, Mr O'Neil." 

There was something about his eyes that stopped me dead. The way they twinkled like they barely held the secret behind them. 

"Let me ask you a question. If I was to give you one million dollars right now, would that make you happy?" 

"Happy," I laughed mirthlessly. "Of course it would make me happy. Who wouldn't it make happy?" 

"You could buy young Thomas a lot of lego with that kind of money."

"Sure, I guess. After I've paid off my mortgage and settled all of our debts, maybe upgrade the car. There would be some left to get Tom some, sure." I mused, doing the calculation in my head. 

Five hundred grand on the house, a further hundred and twenty of Tanya student loans. Fifty grand on the credit cards. The thought didn't make me happy. Even if I paid off all those things, it just wasn't enough. 

"What about if I gave you two million, how would that make you feel?" 

I didn't know where this guy was coming from. If this was some internet stunt to gain karma messing with a guy who clearly had nothing.

"That's better," I peered beyond the book shelves to the window outside. People walked past without giving the bookstore a second glance. It was bright for the first day of winter. Chilly, but with that lingering sunshine of an Australian summer. 

"I'll tell you what, Mr O'Neil. How about I give you five million dollars, right now." 

My head twisted back to the man. He sure looked like he had money. Expensive suit. Expensive watch. That air of someone without money worries. 

"You want to give me five million dollars? Why?" 

"Why not?" He mused. Lifting those hairless brows once again. 

"Alright buddy, you had your fun. The doors that way," a half smile formed on my lips. To be honest, it was the most engaging conversation I had in months. Normally it's, *Have you got this book?* *Can you find me this?* *Can you get me that?*

When the man didn't move, but only smiled at me with straight, sparkling teeth, I found myself doubting that this was a joke. 

"What the catch?" 

The man's smile widened.

"The catch?" 

"Yeah, you know. The catch. The thing. You can have this, but you must do this for me." 

The man straightened his cufflinks and adjusted his sleeves. "Oh that catch. You won't wake up tomorrow."

"What? I couldn't believe what he was saying. Five million dollars and I only had twenty-four hours to enjoy it. The silence hung heavy in the store. My mind was racing. Five million dollars was a lot of money. It could set Tanya and Tommy up. Shit, it could set Tommy's kids up if used right. 

But, dying? Like murdered or something? I struggled to grasp that. Not seeing Tommy again, or Tanya? Was that worth that kind of money? 

There was a part of me that shouted to take it. *Why not? You're not going anywhere fast? You'll still be in this bookstore when you're fifty. Still have all those debts. Why not take the money? You haven't got anything to live for? Tommy will be alright. Think about it. Five million dollars! That kid will have a great life, even if he doesn't have you. Tanya could move on, find a better man than you. Probably a better father than you too. Someone with the drive you don't have. Someone with the time you don't have.* 

I found myself shaking my head when the inner voice stopped. I looked up at the man, who now wore a smug little smile that said, *I think I've got you.*

"Nope. Can do it. Sorry. Five million and I don't get to see my kid again," I shook my head again. "not worth it, buddy. I might not be a good father, I might not be there for him all the time, but I try. And I'll keep trying."

The man produced a phone, opened the screen and looked up at me, then smiling showed me his bank account. There were more zeros there then the screen could hold. 

"Ten million." 

I knew from that point that this wasn't hypothetical. This man was for real. 

I scratched at yesterday's growth, pin pricks of adrenaline rushed up to my neck. Ten million dollars! Maybe I could take the money and flee. Maybe I could take my family away to some island and vanish. 

"I'll tell you what, I'll transfer you the money now and see how it feels to have that in your bank account." 

I found my hand was already on my phone. Before I could change my mind the banking app was open and I was handing it over to the guy. 

After a minute the man looked back up. "There you are. How does that feel?" 

I looked at my balance, -$245 dollars. The screen refreshed and I blanched. $9,999,755.00

My mouth was hanging open when I looked back up. A hot, sticky feeling jumped around my body. A nervous energy that I could only imagine lottery winners feel. 

"Well? How does it feel?" 

"It feels good." I smiled, and then a bubbling laugh came out. The man smiled as I rocked back and forth, holes from one foot to the next. I kissed the screen and yelled in ecstasy.

"Enjoy your money, Mr O'Neil." The man's smile vanished. My laughter was replaced momentarily. 

"Oh right, twenty four hours. Got it." 

A sudden thought occurred to me. "How will it happen? Like will I get shot or drop dead from spending too much money," my grin returned. But the man didn't smile again. 

"That would spoil your fun, Mr O'Neil." Without a second glance, the man turned away. I watched his bald headed glisten in the sunlight as he exited the door and walked away. 

When he left, I bounced around looking at the money in my account. I stopped, suddenly, knowing what I would do first with all this money. I grabbed my jacket, snatched up my keys and left the store, locking the door on my way out. 

The sunlight couldn't feel any warmer as I went to my clapped out Toyota. The keys were inches away when I thought about what I was about to do. With a small chuckle, I patted the car on the roofs. "Good boy, stay." With that I swing my coat over my shoulder and whistled as I walked down the street. 

They'd a restaurant in my town that I've never been able to afford. The type where your footballers and celebrity go and spend a mortgage on champagne. I had my sights set on that. But first I went into the bank, just to double check that the money in my account was truly in my account and not some fake app bullshit. 

Five minutes later, the clerk informed me it was real. 

"Can I withdraw some money?" I asked, glancing over my shoulder in case some heard my account balance and might rob me. 

"Sure, how much do you want?" 

"Is there a limit?" 

The old lady shook her head and smiled pleasantly. I looked past her rose tinted glasses at the kind eyes and thought about what I would need. 

"Ten thousand?" 

"Certainly. Do you want that in big bills?" 

I nodded, glancing around the bank again. The lady behind, having heard and seeing my exchange, looked at me with wide eyes. I smiled quickly, "lottery win," I said, thinking of the first logical thing to say. 

I could say, *oh, I just met a man and he gave it to me, and oh, yeah, I'll be dead tomorrow.*

A few moments later, I held a thick envelope of money under my jacket and walked as quickly away from the bank as I could while drawing attention to myself. 

I skipped across the road and opened the door to the swanky restaurant. The inside was open plan, black marble floors with elegant tables and chairs. The bar was polished brass and held an array of liquor I had never even heard of but looked super expensive. 

"Can I help you?" The Host, a thin man with razor sharp eyes and a nose to match, eyed me up and down. 

"A table for one, please." I saw his subtle sneer as he didn't even pretend to look at his booking diary. 

"I'm sorry, sir but this isn't the restaurant for you. May I suggest the fast food chain down the street?" 

I felt the flush through my body. My hands were sweaty, the envelope under the jacket,  heavier with its righteousness. 

"No. I want to dine here." 

"I'm sorry sir, we are full." The man greased back the side of his hair dismissively. 

I looked over at the people dining. Out of all the tables, only five were sat at. The rest, possibly twenty tables, were unattended. 

"Full? There's nobody here." 

"They are reserved," he said, almost bored with the conversation. 

I turned away feeling stupid for trying. Then I felt the money under my jacket. 

The envelope came open easily and I marvelled at all the green notes. I took out five wraps of one hundred notes and resealed the envelope. 

As I came back to the host, his eyes lazily looked up and then he rolled them.

"I have told you sir, you cannot afford to dine here. Our cheapest dish is one hundred and twenty dollars, and that's a salad." 

"And what's your most expensive meal?" I said, finding a grin creeping up my face. 

"That would be the vintage cote de boeuf at two thousand and two hundred dollars," he sneered again, angling his nose up and back to look down on me. 

"I'll take one of those then." I slapped the money on the counter and had the joy of satisfaction watching his face fall. 

It came starkly clear that I was well out of my comfort zone among the other dinners. The ladies wore more jewelry than I had seen in jewellers, and the men looked like something out of a movie. 

As I waited for my meal, I unconsciously straightened my Yoda t-shirt and smoothed down my hair. My eyes wandered down onto the table. The cutlery sparkled, as did the glasses. I lifted the knife and saw my reflection. I twisted it this way and marveled at how clean its mirrored surface was. As it came to rest on my face again, I saw someone standing behind me. A tall man with the same appearance as my benefactor, only his tie was red instead of blue. 

My neck wrenched as I jumped to look. But there wasn't anyone there. I turned back, slowly. Lifted the knife again so it showed my chest. Then slowly I rolled it out, past Yoda, past my shoulder to the gleaming bulbed light of the restaurant. To the black figure standing not an arm's length behind me. His suit was black, the shirt beneath it, white, the tie a vivid red. I tilted the blade up to his face, and then stopped. 

I twisted again, trying to catch him. But as I did, the waiter was there, bending low to speak to me. 

"What would sir like for a drink?" 

The shock subsided as I quickly thought of a drink. "Coke, please." 

The waiter's eyebrows rose up. "I will see what I can do." And then he was gone. 

My heart was in my chest as I sat back. How could the man be behind me and then not there anymore? And why did he look so weird? Maybe the money somehow made me go crazy? Like being punched drunk after a fight. 

A cold sweat spun up on my brow and laced the back of my neck. The table nearest me, gawked. No even hiding their disdain for someone like me. Something wasn't right. I knew that. I felt sick. Realising the weight of my decision to take the money. The room felt too hot. Clammy. The walls closed in. The ceiling, too low. My chest heaved. Panic rose up and took control. 

The table cloth snagged as I jumped up. The glasses tipped over scattering the cutlery. 

"Sir? Your drink?" I barrelled past the waiter. 

"I'm sorry, I need some air," I choked back, racing for the door. 

The restaurant fell into silence as I charged out into the daylight. For a moment, all I could do was suck down lungfuls of air. The dizziness abated. The fear trickled away from my heart and settled into a knot in my stomach. 


I knew what I saw. It was my imagination. The man in the knife's reflection didn't have a face. No eyes, no nose, no mouth. Just a long, vertical, bloody slit from head to chin.

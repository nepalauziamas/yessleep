 

I met my friends at the local park on Friday, around 20:00 pm. There were 9 of us. We were talking, joking, listening to music and just doing whatever a teenager would. It was the 2nd of September but considering the past days were really warm, most of us were wearing jackets or hoodies. Those were our last days all hanging out together before starting a new school year. 

At around 23:30 pm two of our friends, Mary and Amy went home. Alex, the oldest of us (he is around 17) suggested playing hide n' seek. We all agreed and we used numbers to indicate all of us and used Google to pick the numbers to create the teams. We were 7 so, one team had 3 members and the other 4. I was with Alex and Dave. The game didn't start until it was 00:00 am. 

The other team let us hide first, giving us five minutes to hide. We were lucky enough to be in a village since it had lots of spots to hide to, especially the churches and a house with the female who lived there had gone to her son in Germany. 

Alex had the idea of going into the house since he stated it wasn't at all dangerous. We didn't disagree so we made our way there but sadly, the dogs were barking loudly and we would be in trouble. We continued our way and went to the church but had to run because there were only three minutes left and the church was far. 

We slowed down as we reached the cemetery and saw the gate quite open. We didn't mind much as it was sometimes left like that from visitors. I suggested going behind the cemetery since it was dark and in case someone was coming, we would jump into the cemetery from the pile of rocks behind the wall-like fence. 

I made my way to the back with Alex expecting Dave to follow us. He wasn't. He was staring at a tree with a wooden cross hanging upside down. I snapped a picture of it and we went behind. I saw a light source where I had never seen before and showed it to the rest. We made our way there slowly to make no sound. 

As we got closer, I realized it was a summoning. A pentagram, candles, and a cross which seemed like a boat (mentioned by Dave). A group of people wearing black robes were walking in cycles performing the ritual. We left quietly to make sure they didn't notice us. We hid in some bushes but didn't talk about it. 

The next day, the three of us went to the local priest and talked to him about it, showing the picture of the cross. He said that every year, on one random day they sacrifice one or more civilians and how we were lucky we weren't the ones to be sacrificed. To that day, I'm the only one from the group left. Because I’m the one that led them there. Because, I’m with the cult.

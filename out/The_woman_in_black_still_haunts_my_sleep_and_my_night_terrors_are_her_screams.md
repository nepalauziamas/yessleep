It has been years since I have seen her and even then my heart is thankful it was only a one off...

I worked nights as a cook and as for all of you who also have would know how long the hours are, started at 3pm, finished at 2am never really complained since the money wasn‘t all that bad and it kept me busy. Yeah I was tired lots and the fact it took me an hour to get home on a bus and then walk 10 mins in total it was safe to say I was just walking blob of exhaustion that smelt of sweat and cheap energy drinks.

One night in particular on a cold november night after leaving work, grabbing some burgers off the local chew n spew van, waiting for a bus, getting on, sitting in silence with nothing but the rocking and rumbling of the bus...it was comforting it was safe to say all was normal in a day of a working class dullard eh？Well I got off at my usual stop, street lamps, council houses, murky oak tress blurring together with a creaky thick planked bridge splitting the view, off I walked...

You see to get home I cross a vast park, flat, dirt roaded, few trees and a local play area for the locals to ditch the seeds and buy a packet of cigs, I was cutting across the park in my own world, thinking of how much my toilet is going to regret my poor food choices until-

*whistles*

*My name being called out*
  
I turnt around and saw her...a pale skinned woman with black veins down her neck dressed in a black funeral dress along with a wide black hat dressed with a dark veil hanging below her eyes...Why did she whistle？Why did she call my name and Why is she just standing there？who knows at this point, afterall a drunk in a dress aint the worst thing I have seen and where I lived it was like a village （everyone was up eachothers mud pipes and knew everything about everyone）so i turnt back and carried on walking and-

*whistles*

*my name being called out*

God her voice was cold and shrill...like a 70yr old silver haired English teacher...I whipped myself around and she was in the same spot, same pose, what the fuck is going on with her？I just carried on walking, I aint far from home and there is a alley I cross surrounded by student housing, its ok I am gonna be ok...yeah...im ok

Now I was 10 feet away from that alleyway and just before I took a deep breath-

*whistles*

*calls out my name*

I slowly spun around and SHE WAS RIGHT FUCKING IN FRONT OF ME, I ran for my life, past the alley, along the path, up the road and all the while a loud wail screaming my name in bloody murder, just fucking make it stop I can‘t stop hearing it...made it to my front door...nothing but silence. Looked back and realised she somehow crossed 40 feet of dirt road without making a sound, she had no shadow despite the street lamps shining on her...was I to meet my end that night？I dunno but it has been 6 years and I live nowhere near there anymore...but I can still hear her screams...loud...shrill...blood curdling...malicious...painstricken madness in a form of a woman‘s voice.

I have seen many things in my life, faces and handprints on walls, whispers in the dark, entities standing over while I sleep and hell even now I see my pet dogs running around at night after their passing...but that woman, I know I would of be dead in the morning should she  touch my skin...

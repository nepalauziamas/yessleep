When I got the letter asking for all true Germans to return to our country and take up arms I was living in London. I wasn’t going to go because my business was prosperous however the Nazi regime promised me that there would be no oversight or ethics committee. As long as it furthered their cause I could do whatever I wanted. 

I do not share the Nazi beliefs but when it comes to science, ethics and morals are irrelevant. As long as I framed my experiments as being beneficial to the regime I could do whatever I wanted. 

This was all I needed to join. 

My focus was the human mind. More specifically the chemicals that drive us to do everything from kill to mate to sleep to eat. Because I was already a proven chemist my superiors in the Reich gave me my choice of subjects taken from camps all over Germany. Due to their sacrifice and suffering I learned so much, not only about human limits but also its potential. 

Combining this knowledge with some of the experiments that my colleagues performed, I was able to create a drug that would keep the soldiers of the Reich marching for days without sleep or rest. I called it Pervitin.

I never got credit for its creation because Doctor Otto Ranke stole it from me. Even though I didn't do it for personal glory or medals I was upset that I received no credit. If I would have been recognized as its creator my work may have been given a boost in funding.

Soon I came to the realization that Pervitin was just the tip of the iceberg. When others saw the immediate side effects like lowering of the users cognitive function, irritability and increased psychosis, I saw a weapon. 

If I could create a drug that only gave the users the ill effects, drugging the enemy would weaken their offensive severely. All it would take would be one man to drop it into the enemy water or food supply.

Unfortunately I was never able to convince my superiors of my way of thinking, but at least they couldn't stop me from attempting to create it.

I was close, so close to making a version that was ready for field testing but by then the war started to sway out of our favor. The day I knew that the war was lost was the day when Hitler ordered children to fight as SS troopers. If he was that desperate for bodies then it would only be a matter of time before we lost the war.

I was prepared for this. The stakes were so high that I would have been a fool not to hedge my bets. 

As I fled Germany I left my notes behind for fear of being searched, due to this I had to start over from scratch.

I changed identities in Iceland, Paris and again in Spain where I “died”. After Spain I traveled to America with the last of the stolen Nazi treasures I took and bought a small pharmacy in a town called Gray Hill that was located in the middle of nowhere. Above the pharmacy was my small apartment. I do not rent out the other rooms because my extra curricular activities require complete privacy. Besides, I need the rooms to conduct my experiments and I wouldn't want to sleep in the same room as those vile chemicals. 

During the day I can be seen working in the pharmacy downstairs but in truth I am always thinking about how I can perfect my research. 

In the community I was seen as a trustworthy man who kept to himself. For this reason people felt comfortable around me and would spread gossip about their neighbors. I found it fascinating that these fat Americans thought that they could just share all this information with me and whenever they did I would make mental notes.

For example there was a man who was known to fly into fits of rage when he drank and was also prescribed morphine for chronic pain from a car accident back when he was a teenager. He would be my first subject here in Gray Hill.

I replaced his pills with my own concoction of drugs. After a week that young man killed his father and brother before killing himself. Thankfully I had befriended the local doctors as well as the police beforehand because they love to talk and gossip. The mortician thought of me as a friend but in truth I was just using him to get information that was otherwise unobtainable to me. All I had to do was ask for the autopsy report and he handed it over. I was so excited that it was hard to hide just how giddy I was.

As tempting as it was to repeat the experiment again and again I forced myself to wait between drugging the locals who came into my shop. After all, I didnt want to come under suspicion.

The wait was excruciating. I so desperately wanted to know if there would be any difference if the drug was administered differently. So far all I had done was make it into pill form.

I waited three months for my next experiment, this time a hypochondriac who came in frequently for things she did not need. With the same dosage I used on the previous person I was not surprised to find that the woman ran down her fiance with her car a few days later. She was taken to jail and never fully recovered. According to the doctors and law enforcement I spoke to she has her moments of being lucid but these moments were few and far between. It made me wonder if the effects were permanent? 

Originally I assumed that the drug would leave the subject's system within a day or two but apparently that is not the case. 

I had to stop myself from laughing at this and like the first subject I glued the newspaper clipping into my journal.

If only I could speak with her, take her home, put her in a cage just like I did to the vermin at the camps and run my own experiments on her. That would answer so many lingering questions I have. 

While my drugs did great as long as the person ingested them, infecting a large population proved troublesome. My special blend of crazy lost its potency in the water and even if it didn’t my knees were too old to be climbing the water tower. 

I brainstormed a solution for years but the best I could think of was to hire someone to do certain nefarious things for me. The trouble with that was there was no one I could trust.

This all changed when I caught a girl stealing from my store. Her mother forced her to work for me as punishment and right away I saw her potential. 

In the first week of her employment I surprised her by offering advice when it came to a life of crime. At first she thought I was playing but I made it clear I wasn't when I gave her lockpicking lessons. 

I let her get away with a bunch of things like sneaking off to be with her boyfriend. Doing this meant that she would see me as a “cool guy” and would be more likely to do certain things for me around town. 

It was easy to manipulate her into doing these things for me and every time they kept escalating. After nearly a year and a half of being my employee I was finally ready to test my newest batch of drugs. She was under the impression that it was LSD she was pouting into the schools emergency water tanks and I cultivated this lie because I knew she would find it funny to see her teachers “tripping”. 

A week later she bit off her friend's nose and was taken to jail. She will be tried as an adult and I doubt that she will be getting out anytime soon. After all, I will be a character witness in her trial and “I am a poor old man who was forced to pick up the slack while she kept sneaking away to meet with her boyfriend.”

Whisper Alley Echos’ headline for that was “... to spite a face”. 

With this latest update it meant that unlike my previous versions, the newest batch was resistant to water. 

Years of my life have been dedicated to this goal so while the progress I have made is noteworthy I have a long way to go. Thankfully I have plenty more subjects to experiment on.

Now I just need to make another help wanted sign.

Okay, so this is the story about the old home I used to live in and this story will probably stay with me for the rest of my life because looking back now that I am older it's quite scary and i would like to share the story with you guys My mom, dad, sister, and I moved into a new house when I was about 8 years old. I wasn't aware of anything I'm about to say in this post because I was so young, and my family didn't want to freak me out. But now that I know everything, it's actually quite terrifying. I am also not the greatest at telling stories so bear with me.

So, when we first moved into the home, there was a furnace room with cement flooring, and a pentagram spray painted on the floor with names around it... first and foremost, creepy. I actually found out from my sister, and when I was younger, I was a bit nosy, so I wanted to know things like "did a priest come here?" My family is very religious, so I was aware of such matters. They told me a priest did come and bless the home and did all this stuff, but I later discovered that was a lie LOL. 

A lot of strange things happened in that house, not to me, but apparently to my mother and sister. My mother would have these terrifying demonic dreams, and my sister had some strange things happen to her as well. I never noticed anything strange as I grew older, but looking back, I can definitely see how the vibes in that house were incredibly negative, with my parents constantly fighting and my sister suffering from severe depression. 

One of the nightmares my mom would have is a demon trying to get into the house through her window, the one she told me freaked me right out. She then woke up from this dream and my dad would lie on the side closer to the nightstand and there was a bible on the nightstand. My mom tried to reach over and get the bible but she explains that it felt like she couldn't reach over and grab it, it felt like something was stopping her. She then tries again with all her power, she gets the bible and she opens it up and the page that opens up is the one that has a prayer, she tries to read this prayer out loud and it's like she just suddenly doesn't know how to read, once shes able to read it out loud all of the scary energy goes away.

My sister is older so when we all lived together she wanted privacy, living with a little sister (myself) she didn't get much privacy because like I said, I was quite nosey as a kid. My sister ended up moving her room into the basement so she could kind of have her own little place down there. Now that I am older she told me how when she would fall asleep she would wake up gasping for air and something just didn't feel right, felt like something was down there with her.. even felt like she was being watched.  Thinking about that now I always wondered when I was a kid why she moved back upstairs but I guess that makes sense now. 

My parents divorced in 2017, and my sister stayed with my father while I moved in with my mother. My father was living with a friend, who was staying in my old room. My dad's friend ended up hanging himself on the chin-up bar I had installed between the door frames. Rest in peace, that is a difficult pill to swallow because it is extremely sad and heartbreaking. We sometimes drive past the house and get a creepy vibe; something just doesn't feel right. It makes me wonder what would have happened if my parents had never divorced and we had still lived in that house. 

The house has been completely re done because sometimes i will look up the home and it will come up on websites to buy (it has been bought). Okay now here is where the one weird thing happened to me and this is the only weird thing that has happened to me that has anything to do with this home. 

I went to this camp counsellor training type thing about 2 and a half years ago because I wanted to get a summer job as a camp counsellor. There were about 30 people my age and we were all sitting at tables and we got this paper we needed to fill out basically just information about ourselves, phone number, home address, and stuff like that.

So I look at the girl's paper beside me... and I kid you not, the home address of that house was on there... which means she lives there. Is it a coincidence? maybe???  But what are the chances of that happening? That was so creepy and strange to me, how is that even possible?!!!! Clearly, I didn't say anything. What should I have said? "Yeah the house you're living in is actually haunted" 

Who knows if the place was even "haunted" I don't know how I feel about that word, I definitely believe there was something evil about that place, not exactly sure what it was because like I said, nothing weird happened to me while living there but maybe that was because I was just a kid. My dad and i were really connected to god back then and i was really obsessed with anything to do with god because my dad was very religious and i was super close with him so maybe that has something to do with why nothing weird happened to either of us? Who knows. 

I've always wanted to go there and mess around with an ouija board, but I'm afraid you never know what kind of gate that will open. Obviously, I couldn't do that because people now live there, but it was just a thought. 

Anyways, that's my story of the old home I used to live in. Comment what you think, ive never shared this story with anyone except close friends so I wanna hear what you guys think about all of this. 

Thanks for reading!

To reap or not to reap, that is the question. 

Is it not unfair that I must steal the lives of others?

And yet, when I know it is their time, I must do as I am told.

For if I were to falter from my preset instructions,

God knows what could happen to a very little child.

God is like that, you see, he will take a life for a life.

And in his opinion a small darling is worth less

Than a modern middle-aged man.

And while I don’t agree, I wouldn’t fight,

Because we all know that God is always right. 

So I follow my instructions to-a-t 

Every day for twenty hours and I get a break from

One-pm-to-five. 

I don’t need to sleep or eat but 

sometimes it is nice

To walk along a beachy ocean or to 

meet a lot of strangers.

I’m a big fan of speed dating, though I 

don’t think I can feel love,

But that’s not a problem because I do it 

for the fascination

That I have with humans, they are 

shocking and confusing

And they make me want to watch them for a while. 

One time there I met this Scarlett, 

she lied about her job.

She said she was a bank teller, but she was an escort.

See, nobody can lie to me but I do my best to judge the least.

Because Scarlett also lied about her three-year-old who has leukemia.

And instead she was wearing this beautiful fancy dress

That I know she got from the thrift shop on the corner of Six and Eve. 

She said she was unwed and had no kids and that she was doing great,

So I took her hand and told her that no-one is ever fine. 

She asked me to come home with her after a round of drinks and food

and I saw little Eternity in her room asleep. 

And I realized she’d be gone in just a week. 

I held Scarlett in my arms as she cried. 

And I told her that no matter what I’d 

find her wherever she might be.

And I left her with two-thousand-cash 

that I found in the alley trash

Of Denny’s on the parkway back in ‘93. 

I’d never understood the need for
currency 

until now but I had kept it 

In my house just because I had a 

feeling that I’d need it.

And, honestly, nothing will beat the face that Scarlett made.

And before I left that night I looked at 

Eternity sleeping peacefully and 

Asked Scarlett why she named her that. 

She said she had a dream that Death himself had told her

That her girl would live forever if she only had that name. 

So I stood there in the foyer of her 

small apartment complex

Looking for something to say to that.

Until I realized that she didn’t know that I was that man

And that I remembered back when I liked to mess with dreams.

And then I wondered why I’d just called the endless

Power-surging life-taking darkness-bearing being

That I am

A man. 


One week later I went into the  apartment

in the cloak of darkness 

Terrified to take a life, I’ve never felt this before.

But before I could open the old door I heard the fighting. 

I took off my invisibility and went in very forcefully.

I went up to that man and punched him square in the face.

He hit the wall, and then the lamp, and had a deep gash in his head

Immediately I knew he was dead. 

Scarlett ran to the phone in the other room,

And I pulled my scythe out and,

Touched his soul and watched it float above the air.

Scarlett came back and said she’d called 9-1-1.

And we checked on Eternity, who somehow 

Still slept peacefully, and Scarlett 

hugged me and she cried. 

And for the first time in my life I shed a tear.

I realized standing there with blood on my hand

And her in my arms

That maybe I actually was a man. 



God and I had a dark chat

And he made a deal with me

That for Eternity’s life, I’d lose my immortality.

And maybe that was stupid, but now that I am human,

it’s no longer 

A simple question that I asked myself 

Walking along the beach, 

For now Scarlett and I walk hand-in-hand. 

And I know that in two years she will be pregnant

And we’ll marry in the church where she was born. 

She doesn’t know that I can see the future 

Or that I used to be a reaper

But I no longer worry about that. 

Somewhere in the world there is a new man

Or woman who will come for me

I tucked Eternity in bed, she just turned ten today.

I gave her a kiss on the head. 

I go to bed with Scarlett and always say I-Love-You,

I know that when she wakes up I’ll be gone. 

A heart attack in bed will take me before dawn.

So I took her hand and told her that no matter what 

She does, I’ll always love her and I’ll miss her.

She asked me what was wrong, I said a bad feeling in my heart.

She kissed me and said she loved me more than anything

In the world, except maybe her kids, 

and I told her that’s probably fair.

I said I don’t know what will happen when I wake up

But that I am surely not afraid of Death. 

She gave a laugh, the smile I love, and said that was absurd. 

We cuddled and I fell asleep, and that was the last thing I know

For I woke up in heaven, where God said I was good. 

In the end I’ve no regrets,

And I have no fear. 

I will live, dead, in this new-old world, so familiar 

With nostalgia, seeing friends who now see me as a stranger. 

It is worth it, I will build a home right here in this new universe

For when the girls and my son join me someday by my side. 

To reap or not to reap is a question I’d asked years ago

And honestly the answer is do both yet do not do both. 

Do some of one and some of the other 
Let yourself be near another

And to any reaper, I say you are in charge. 

I’ll wait here now, peacefully. My job has been complete. 

I’ll wait here for my love, and for my son, and 

I’ll wait here for Eternity.

I work in a small restaurant business in Hammersmith, London. I’ve been working there for half a year trying to save up to go to Oxford as I had been accepted about 11 months prior. I currently live in a small apartment in the east of the city and I’m a regular commuter. 

Last night, my boss told me that I can earn extra if I work an extra 6 hours as the restaurant is low on staff at this point. I agreed, thinking “Yes! One step closer to Oxford!” After spending 6 gruelling hours scrubbing tables and mopping floors, our restaurant closed for the night. I made my way to the tube station. When I saw the time I realised that the last train was departing in only 2 minutes. I started sprinting frantically trying to reach the station. At the station I was panting, out of breath as I turned my head towards the platform. To my dismay I saw that the last train of the day had just started departing, leaving me stranded in the tube station. I groggily reached out for my phone. I was going to call a taxi when suddenly I hear an announcement that the next train is arriving into the station. 

I sighed with relief as I merrily strode towards the platform. The train doors opened and I boarded the train. I sat down and started to relax. Then I looked to my left. Everyone sitting next to me was asleep. I looked to my right. It was the same. Everyone was asleep. I was extremely confused at this point. The announcement said “This train terminates at Royal London Hospital.” 

I hadn’t heard this station name ever on the Hammersmith and City Line. I looked at my map. The station name wasn’t there. Before I could do anything, the doors closed. The train violently jerked forward as it left the station. 

Then I noticed something. The train wasn’t stopping at any stations on the line. It was going through every single one. I was really confused. I asked the person next to me if he knew where this train was going and where it was stopping. No reply. I asked again. He didn’t even notice me. I tried shaking him awake but the slumped forward in his seat. I felt his neck. It was stone cold to the touch. I then looked at his face. It was pale, sickly and lifeless. I started feeling very uneasy and I swiftly felt for a pulse. None. He wasn’t asleep. He was dead. 

I checked the woman opposite to me. Dead. 
I pulled the train alarm and the driver started speaking over the intercom. He was breathing weakly and wheezing. He told me sternly to “Get out now.” I asked him why and he gave no answer. The train was moving quickly and all the doors were locked. I couldn’t escape. The train passed through Whitechapel and then, all of a sudden I heard a loud CRASH. I blacked out before I could see the situation. 

I woke up in the same seat. The passengers next to me were awake. They all looked extremely nervous. I asked the man next to me where we were going. He excitedly yelled “THE FINAL EXIT! THE FINAL EXIT!” 

I looked out of the window to see a blinding white light. We were in a lush green field. The sun was shining very brightly. All that was there was a set of two Victorian houses. Each identical to each other. I kept staring at the houses. The train painfully screeched to a halt. I kept looking at the houses to see if there was anything else. I saw that they were completely 2 dimensional. There was nothing behind then at all. 

The doors suddenly opened and everyone alighted. They started being lined up in rows by small women in white garments. Some were lined up to the left house and some were lined up to the right. The people on the right looked calm and peaceful and the people on the left looked terrified and bewildered. I looked inside the doors of the house to see fire in the left and bright light in the right.

 I tried to escape down the track but the scenery just kept repeating itself. I am still running and trying to escape but nothing is working. It’s been 23 hours and I still can’t find an escape to this place.

I’m currently writing this from my phone. There is a signal however I don’t know where it’s from. Everything’s been repeating itself and I feel like I’m walking in a circle. The tracks don’t end and I don’t know where they even started. No matter where I run I seem to be running in a circle. 

Digital maps are showing where I last was in Hammersmith and they will not update. Calls will not work here either. I genuinely have no escape. Do not board the Hammersmith and City Line after Midnight or you might end up in this twisted place too.

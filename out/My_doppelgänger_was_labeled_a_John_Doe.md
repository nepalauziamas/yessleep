For about 7 years I worked as a psychiatrist as well as a therapist for Side Hill mental institution for the criminally insane. Despite what you may think, most patients weren’t violent or “evil” towards us, simply people who were unfortunately incapable of prossessing the world and lacked the treatment, or people needed to help. Plenty were able to better themselves through the right medication and teaching. I even remember two patients were named fit to re-enter society during my time there. Don’t get me wrong though, there were very much so violent, and even a bit twisted. Some of which I'm fairly certain were sane people who managed to get the insanity plea, others gave the signs of quite competent serial killers, were they of stable mind. There was one patient that I believe, without question, was a spawn of hell.

It was about lunch time when one of the nurses came into my office looking rather uncomfortable, even more so when she made eye contact with me, before clearing her throat and fixing her composure. “Uh Dr. Keegan, you’re wanted in the patient questioning office.” she said a little frantically. I raised an eyebrow and just stared at her for a moment. You see this “questioning” office was essentially an interrogation room for patients who commuted crime within the walls, or suspects who were obviously not in a right state of mind, be that mental issues or extreme drug use. As you could imagine, these cases were handled by either the police, or staff better equipped for handling these such cases than myself. This patient would be far different however.

“yeah, um, sure” I said with a hint of confusion as I got up from my desk and began making my way down to the office. This confusion only grew as I met the head of psychology along with two police officers. I greeted them and asked a question that sent a small chill down my spine, an even greater wave following it as Dr. Swan asked me a question. “Steve, you got any siblings?”. I felt the earth stand still as my nerves locked up. “yeah a little sister. That isn’t her in there is it?” I asked frantically. “No she’s not here, but you may still wanna see this.” he replied bluntly. I looked at him in confusion, which turned to fear as the sound of laughter filled the hall. Now it wasn’t a deranged howling or anything like that, A completely normal laugh coming from within the interrogation room…the sound proof interrogation room.
 
I quickly rushed over to the room window to see a man sitting at the table, rapidly rocking side to side in his chair, an occasional and severe twitch in his neck, so violent you’d think it’d snap. He also seemed to be holding a meeting, as he began talking around the empty table and waving his arms around. What was strange was the fact we couldn’t hear any of his one way conversations, just his laughs. “He’s been doing that for about two hours, but he won’t talk to us. Soon as one of us steps in the room he stops all motion, like he went catatonic.” One of the officers said with a sigh as he fished out a pack of smokes. “Okay so why do…” I began before taking a closer look and I noticed something that made my blood run cold. Now, you don’t often see the back of your own head, but it’s still noticeable, even more so when you have a very specifically X shaped birthmark on your neck. 

“Looks like you caught on huh” Dr. Swan said as he handed me two sheets of paper, one labeled Steve Keegan, the other, John Doe. On these sheets were a set of fingerprints…a set of identical fingerprints. “we’ve gone through your medical files to compare DNA tests, X-rays, CAT scans, whatever we had available. We’ve checked height, weight, we ran a full facial scan, damn near everything. All of them were an identical.” He continued with a deep sigh. “And what is he here for?” I asked in cautious fear. The two officers looked at one another for a while, before the older one spoke. “Came into the station covered in blood and holding a butcher knife, babbling about how he did the job, the snakes have lost their heads or some nonsense like that. After some tests we figured out most of the blood was from a pig, some his own…and some from a young couple who went missing a few years back. After that he refused to speak to anyone, only demanding to see the mirror” While my mind was trying to process everything I had just been told, the other officer asked something that took all my attention. 

“Can you try talking to him?” He asked somewhat nervously. I looked at the two as if they were the crazy ones, expecting me to go in there with a killer…a killer who looked just like me. As dangerous as he might’ve been, I needed to know more about this evil clone. So with a deep breath in, and one more glare towards the officers, I entered the room and made my way over to the table. Just as they said he was frozen in place when I entered the room, but once he saw who it was he’d be speaking too, his blank face turned into a wide sinister smile. I on the other hand could only choke on confused fear and worry as I looked at my twisted reflection.

It was like standing in a mirror that projects a reflection of yourself. One that has gone completely mad. His hair was disheveled and unkempt. Cuts and bruises covered his arms and face. His hands, still caked with dry blood looked to have been burnt from the wrist down, crosses sloppily carved into the backs of his hands. What was most disturbing above all that however, were his eyes. They were what can only be described as completely deranged. They were far too wide open, rarely ever blinking, and bloodshot to the point it looked to have red spider webs forming out from his Irises. He quickly began rocking again as he looked at me, then the table, then me again, seemingly signaling me to sit down, and after a few minutes of weighing my options I did just that. 

I cleared my throat as I looked at him before starting my line of questions, trying to sound as calm and collected as possible when doing so. “Well this is certainly interesting, so do you have a name you’d like me to call you by?” I tried to be as polite as possible. He tapped the counter softly as he looked at me. “They've all been calling me John, so you can call me John, good ol Johnny boy.'' he began. Much like his appearance, his voice was no different than mine, say for the twisted excitement in it. Think Mark Hamill's joker, as if he had been holding in laughter with every word. “Okay John, do you mind telling me where you are?” I asked. He looked at me for a while, his neck occasionally cracking before answering. “Side hill, yup yup yup that’s it, Side Hill hospital. Hey that was alliteration, or was it a simile?…whatever it sounds funny.” He said with a soft giggle, silently clapping  to himself. Finally I asked the question that turned our conversation from unsettling to disturbing.

“And would you mind telling me why you’re here John?” I asked, a hint of caution in my voice, and when he answered, it felt for a moment even the darkest pits of hell had more light in it then the man sitting before me. “Oh because I killed them. Oh yeah I killed em reeeeaaaal good. Slowly too, opened them both from gut to chin.” He said with great pride, no longer able to hold in his chuckles any longer as he told me of his actions, causing him to burst out in the most twisted and sinister laughter I’ve ever heard, as he began clapping slightly louder. Now I've dealt with the more violent patients on multiple occasions, even some of the killers, but none of them were this happy and foreword about the terrible things they’ve done. It didn’t help that the overjoyed psychopath shared the same face as my own. I felt a chill run down my spine so bad it should’ve given me frostbite, as I tried to swallow my fear as I pushed forward. 

“And who are they” I asked through shaking breaths. As soon as those words hit his ears, that sinister grin painted across his face somehow grew even wider. “The ones who stabbed us in the back steve.” He said, cackling as he did so. I could feel myself freeze up in fear, as if I had been caught in medusa’s stone gaze, forced to stay planted as I watched my doppelgänger howl like a laughing hyena as he violently began nodding his head as well as pointing back and forth between the two of us. As he did so I noticed something extremely alarming. He had somehow slipped off his hand cuffs. I looked towards the two way mirror in an attempt to signal somebody that I may be in danger, only to be met with more laughter. “Oh yeah don’t worry about them, they’re not there anymore, or I guess it would be more accurate to say we aren’t there anymore.” He said with a confident smirk. I felt a cold sweat spread through my body as everything he began to tell me battled in my head to decide what would be questioned first until I finally landed on one. 

“John, who did you kill?'' I asked slowly, trying to prepare for his answer. That answer horrified me deeply. “Oh nobody special. Just that sweet little flower of ours, and of course that slimy, two faced snake in the garden.” He said, his normally dementedly joyful tone turning to one of bitter malice on those last words, before quickly breaking out into another wave of cackles. Suddenly it all made sense, he was talking about my ex Daisy…my ex Daisy who left me for my best friend before running off together. I could feel my body begin to shake as the dark images flashed through my head. “and the pigs blood?” I asked weakly as the passing thought of the officer's words came by. “Well I needed to give them a demonstration didn't I?” He almost sarcastically asked. 

I could feel a wave of vomit slowly crawl its way out of my stomach at his words. Sure I despised both of them with a fair amount of passion, a murder fantasy was never something I actually thought about, especially not one in the manner he described. After a few minutes of mentally breaking down and hyperventilating, I asked the question I should’ve asked at the very start. “who are you? what are you?” It seemed that was also the question he’d been waiting to answer. As the moment he heard it his grin stretched wider than ever before, then with the literal blink of an eye, he was standing on the table in a crouched position to meet me face to face. I nearly fell back in my seat the moment he moved, teleported more like, as he slowly raised his arm up, before softly tapping my temple with his index finger, then bringing it to his own head to do the same to himself, before quickly sending his hand towards my face and shoving me to the ground, his twisted laughter quickly following 

The back of my head collided with the tile flooring putting me in a heavy daze. By the time I regathered my bearings I had felt someone rapidly shaking my shoulders. I shot up and began sliding away from whoever had been standing over me, only to look up and see dr. Swan and the two officers, all having faces of great worry and confusion. They quickly began explaining that not long after I had entered the room, there was a power outage within it. They tried to get in but the door wouldn’t budge, and by the time the lights came back and they were able to get in all they saw was me flat on my back screaming bloody murder. All files of  John Doe had been completely wiped, much like him they just vanished into thin air.

I resigned soon after that. Eventually the F.B.I found their way to our hospital, leaving me to be the one being questioned, their responses were unnerving to say the least, not to mention highly confidential . Most of it has been kept under wraps and away from the public due to the strange and unexplainable nature of the situation. Hell Daisy's death was only a passing mention in our local news, both identities of the victims remaining anonymous. After all they went off the grid years ago, no more than a shadow to the people in town . I’ve moved far away, states away, out of sheer paranoia. I’m absolutely terrified of myself, what I can become, or maybe what I already am. I’ve tried to forget the horrible experience, but it always creeps back into my mind, Fueling me with fear at the thought of what I’m possibly capable of…especially when I hear the sound of deranged cackles coming from outside my bedroom window.

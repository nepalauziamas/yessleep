This shit has been gnawing at my soul for a few months now but there's absolutely nothing for it. No one involved will tell me anything and have made it brutally clear that they want less than nothing to do with me. Whatever happened on those nights has pushed away basically everyone close to me, and I still don't know what happened or if it will happen again. All I know is that I committed unspeakably depraved acts to which I alone remain utterly (and blissfully?) ignorant.

I started experimenting with weed in college. I'd never been much of a drug user so it was fun letting myself go and feeling sensations I'd never felt before. Thus I became a bit of a stoner in my freshman year, but I made sure to always keep that seperate from my schoolwork. I never had any adverse reactions, although my friends would talk about how giggly weed made me despite how out of character that sounded--I'm pretty laid back and always felt like a more zen version of myself while high. And I certainly couldn't recall any of the small laughing fits they described. But laughing while high isn't exactly odd behavior so I never thought much of those discrepancies. 

Fast forward to final exams. They were almost over so I wanted to celebrate with my girlfriend, who came from a pretty religious family and was pretty straight edge herself. Despite this she'd been wanting to try smoking with me and on that Monday night (she had no class the next day) we carefully smoked out the window of my dorm. She was paranoid about the smell and such but otherwise it was a pretty pleasant experience. We watched some movie and cuddled and eventually just fell asleep.

When I woke up the next morning, she simply wasn't there. It was only 7 a.m. and nothing was open yet so I was at a loss as to where she would have gone. After a few minutes of waiting I went to check in the bathroom, but nothing. She had brought along a toiletry bag and some clothes and I realized all that was gone too. She had left with no intention of returning. Confused but not entirely worried, I called her.

It immediately went to voice mail, which I knew meant two things: her phone was dead or she had blocked me. So I forced myself to believe the former as I went about my day--there was nothing else I could do. She didn't go to the same college as me and because she lived with a homebody roommate I had never seen her dorm, didn't know where it was. Unless she answered my calls or texts, which went undelivered, I couldn't do shit.

And that was how my first real relationship ended: total, eerie radio silence after what I had thought was a fun and fairly unremarkable night. She had blocked me on all social media, too. A friend theorized that she woken up feeling guilty about smoking and thought of me as a bad influence, and that was the only thing that made any kind of sense. She was also from out of town and might not have wanted a long distance relationship over summer, but that still didn't account for her surgical removal of herself from my life. I eventually did visit her campus to see if I could spot her, or just something, but I never did. I couldn't shake the feeling that I was somehow responsible, that I must have done *something*, but besides smoking, which had been her idea in the first place, I didn't have a clue what that might be.

I became a little insecure after that and was mildly reclusive for the summer. I quit smoking and drank instead on the few occasions I would go out. I missed her but our relationship hadn't been perfect and might well have ended for the summer anyway, but I still wished there had been an true ending. It feel wrong to spend so much time with someone just for them to inexplicably vanish in the middle of the night. It made me feel unclean somehow.

Fast forward my entire college career. I'd fully grown out of my stoner phase and infrequently had a puff or two at social events. During that time I made some really truly close friends, the kind I had never made in high school, and felt great and certain of myself. I even dated someone again and got to experience a proper breakup, which sucked so bad that I almost understood why my previous partner would want to sidestep that process entirely. That breakup gave me the closure I'd been waiting for since my first relationship was cut short, and I was finally able to forgive my first ex, which was a strange source of catharsis as I got over my second ex.

Until I saw her at a bar in senior year, made eye contact with her, smiled and shrugged, and in what appeared to be genuine panic she straight up *fled* the establishment. I thought about going after her to ask what the hell her deal was, but as maddening as her behavior was, she clearly still held some fear or resentment toward me that chasing her would only worsen. Any closure I had gotten evaporated and was replaced with a creeping self-doubt. My friends couldn't theorize anything this time, instead asking me if I was sure I hadn't done anything to her. I got defensive, but privately I wasn't so sure. The shadow that fell over her face when she saw me again, the dread that gripped her in that moment, began to haunt me.

Anyway, months later, and I've graduated college. My five good buddies and I have been planning a camping trip for quite a while and in June of this year we finally go. We drive to this nice spot in upstate Montana, set up our little campsite, have a fire, have fun. In my post-college excitement I decide to go ahead and take many hearty pulls off the blunt they pass around. I share a joint with my friend, too. I am wasted and high and sitting around the campfire with them is one of the most meaningful experiences of my life. Sometime past midnight we go to bed, two to a tent, but I talk with my friend for another hour or so before passing out.

I wake up very relaxed, slightly hung over but feeling great besides. My friend isn't in the tent anymore and neither is his sleeping bag, but in my stupor I don't register this as anything. I have to take a piss so I unzip the tent and step out into the crisp morning air.

All of the tents besides mine have been collapsed and packed up, as has the rest of the campsite. Something reeks and I notice a puddle of vomit near where our fire used to be, too big to have been made by one person. An icy, too-familiar fear takes me over as I jog the little way out to where we parked. I hear low voices and what can only be sobbing. My ex's terrified face flashes in my mind, and I tell myself I'm being irrational.

All of my friends are in or near the car, clearly about to leave. The friend I shared the tent with is bawling his eyes out in the passenger seat. Once I get close enough for them to see me their eyes widen. My friend in the passenger is screaming for the driver to go, the two guys still outside the car stop me from approaching with a look of paralyzing anger and disgust. One starts shouting that he can't believe he thought I was his friend all these years, what the fuck is wrong with me, what *the fuck* *is wrong with me*, and the other looks ready to vomit. I ask what happened but they don't even register the question. My friend just keeps shouting at me until the other drags him into the car, saying it isn't worth it, and then they speed away, leaving me stunned and horrified and stranded in the woods with a tent that isn't mine.

For a very long time I just stand there, at an utter loss. I feel like my blood has been replaced with sewage, like I'm dirtier than any shower could help. Part of me is hurt at the insane cruelty of my friends, but I don't even know if I should be. I just stand there, self-doubt tearing me apart, for what feels like the entire morning, not daring to contemplate just what I could have done last night. I half-expect the police to come and find me there, but I'm left completely alone.

I collapse the tent and hoist it over my shoulder and start walking south. A long, delirious walk. I don't know what to make of anything. I don't know where I'm going and don't want to reach my destination. I want to know but I also do not.

I eventually find a gas station where I can use a phone and call a cab home. My parents are curious why the trip has ended so soon, but I'm just glad they themselves aren't horrified by my appearance, which I half-expected they would be.

My friends are no longer my friends. They blocked me on everything. For a few days I just hide out in my house, the tent in my closet a reminder of something horrific that I can't for the life of me remember. I want to get drunk to keep from crawling out of my skin but I don't trust myself. I refuse to touch weed again in my whole life, though I still have no idea if that was what woke up the monster that repelled all the good people in my life. The monster waiting to ruin anyone else I get close to.

Eventually I can't take it anymore and I bring the tent to my friend's apartment when I know he's home. I knock, and I know he knows it's me because he doesn't open the door. Rather than banging the hinges off the thing, like I want to, I just sit down on his front step and wait. I remember the great conversation we were having in the tent, though I find I can't recall exactly what we talked about.

Eventually, after hours, I hear the door open. My friend, my once good friend, stands there like he's barely holding himself back from throwing me down the stairs. I say I brought him his tent, and he says nothing. After a staring contest which he wins, he tells me he's not fucking touching the thing. I ask what I did, what the *hell* happened that night, please tell me I'm going crazy, and something dreadful passes across his face. He says he will never speak of that night again. Then he starts ranting about how he was finally getting to the point he could get off of his meds, he has a generalized anxity disorder, but how I set him back fifteen years and how our other friend Ian cannot fucking sleep anymore, and so on, raving at me, saying how *fucking dare* I play dumb, how in Christ did someone like me gain his genuine trust, I should kill myself, please, please just kill yourself. It all cuts quite deeply but he also doesn't seem to be talking about me, exactly. After he runs out of steam, still looking at me like I murdered someone close to him, I ask in a strained calm voice if I did anything violent or sexual. He says that I raped their minds. I ask what that means, but he gives me a look so hateful I can't do it anymore and get up to leave. His face flashes again at my movement and he shoves me, catching me on my left shoulder so that I spin back and fall back, hitting my head on the stairs and breaking my left arm with an audible snap, and I tumble down the stairs and by the time I thwack my head on the pavement the door is already closed and the tent is already tumbling after me.

My arm healed perfectly fine, so have the bruises, but I've started to get chronic headaches. I'm forced to lay in bed and just stare at the ceiling for hours on end, nauseated halfway to death by any and all sensations. I lay there and think about what I could have done and what I will do and who I am and who I can't help but become. My car was keyed while I was in the hospital; that and my renewed  reclusivity have alerted my parents that something is up. But whenever they ask just what that is, I say honestly that I do not know. My doctor suggested cannabis could help with my nausea, and I said but that wouldn't help anyone else's nausea, and he gave me a confused look while I laughed and laughed my head off.

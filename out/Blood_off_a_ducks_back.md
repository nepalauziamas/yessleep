I first started sharing my two weeks ago in the post [Feathers in the Attic](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vngwif/feathers_in_the_attic/). Since then, I’ve posted three updates, the last being [Fine Feathered Foes](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vrxzhc/fine_feathered_foes/).

My father looks different than the man in my memories. In my oldest fears - he is a giant. Tall and hovering, bellowing cruel laughter as his very presence threatens to erase me and Robin from the face of the world. But the person in front of us is a small, unimposing old man. His limbs are insect thin, and graying folds of skin sag off the underside of his arm as he lifts a key to open the rusty cage door. The ancient structure doesn’t give way, and he leans over to hit another angle with the key. The top of his head is entirely bald apart from an ugly cluster of warts that sprinkle out above his left ear. 

“Fuckin’ useless old thangs,” he mutters at the keys, shaking them violently as though force is the answer for everything. As he tries the door again, he uses his left hand to pull out a cigarette, placing it between colorless lips. He brings up a lighter with the same free hand and it shakes so badly he struggles to light the cigarette.

Finally, the lock cracks open and the door swings inward with a screech of the hinges.

I feel like I should say something. I feel like this is my moment. Reunited with my childhood tormentor, the man who made the town believe mom was crazy, who never showed a drop of affection toward me and Robin. The man with the secret drawer. The one I’m convinced is a murderer. I should do something, say something. Unfortunately, reality is not as generous as the climax of a really good film. There is no spotlight, no dramatic pause. It is just me, sweaty and aching from the encounter with the snake, and Jonah, who I assume is on the brink of passing out. Now is not the time to dance with my demons, it is a time to flee.

“We need to call 911,” I say, my voice surprisingly controlled, adult, “My boyfriend is hurt.” 

“If he were a real man he’d shake it off,” my father avoids my eye, but gives Jonah a smile as he walks over and attempts to give him a hand. He steps around the oozing snake carcass as though it were a pile of horse manure, unpleasant but not atypical. 

Jonah, eyes focused now, ignores the gesture, awkwardly pulling himself off the ground to stand firmly on two feet. He is practically naked, his plaid boxer shorts the only clothing item retaining his dignity. Though I am worried about him exerting himself so much right now, I am pleased by this cold treatment of my father. Jonah was the first person I told about the abuse, and he was also the first person who didn’t try to justify my father’s actions with phrases like “well he has been alone for a very long time” or “he has suffered a lot in his life”. 

“Atta boy,” my father laughs through smoke-worn lungs, rasping as he takes another drag of a cigarette that is almost entirely made up of ash at this point, “Hope yer keepin’ this one happy, Ava,” he adds, winking at me.

“It is not your daughter’s responsibility to keep anyone else happy,” Jonah replies, his voice growing stronger, which I consider a miraculous feat after all he’s been through, “It never has been.”

The clouds are gone now, and the three of us squint awkwardly at each other in the blinding sun. I cast a side glance at the house. The second floor is visible above the wilderness of the backyard and I think about how reckless I was, imagining its dangers could be contained within rotting walls.

“Ya’ll come inside now,” my father finally says, “Gots a lotta catchin’ up to do and all that.”

They both look at me. Jonah, waiting for a hint of snark from the girl he knows to be fearless. My father, probably hoping for some sort of familiar acknowledgement, as though nothing ever happened. 

“I have to get Jonah to the emergency room,” I say, my tone pointed, my line of vision floating somewhere above their heads, “We should go.”

Jonah and I hobble past my father, out of the cage, and start walking up the path that brought us to the snake trap. I realize now that this place leaves no one unscathed. Not my sister, not my boyfriend, and as for my father… I don’t know. Maybe when two great evils meet they sort of just simmer together, waiting to combust at a specific moment in time.

We are in a shared patient room in the emergency wing of the town hospital. I don’t recall ever coming here as a kid, but I still get a vague feeling that the place has changed a lot over the years. The walls are paneled white, and the lights above our heads are needlessly bright. Cheap beige curtains are drawn around the bed, giving us a little bit of privacy, but not much. Not enough to talk through everything that has happened.

Hours pass before the doctor comes to check on Jonah.

“It’s the strangest thing I’ve ever seen,” doctor Matthews leans in to stare at Jonah’s chest through a lens, “There are no traces of venom,  no signs of inflammation, no indication of blood clotting. In all honesty this bite looks more like a cadaver incision from a med school student than anything an animal could make.”

The doctor straightens up to write something in her notepad. Her eyes flicker suspiciously between myself and Jonah. It’s not that surprising. I probably would have tried to fudge the facts a little bit before telling my story to the head nurse, but Jonah is new to all this.

“Vitals look normal,” the doctor continues, flipping to a new page in her clipboard, “We also did a white blood cell count, which came back average as well. Due to the nature of the events you’ve described, we also felt it necessary to run some basic drug tests, and we will be keeping you for observation until those results come back.”

Of course, the small-town answer for every evil known to man - drugs. I see Jonah’s expression grow dark as he registers the implications of what the doctor is saying. They are going to hold him just long enough to be sure they don’t have to hand him over to the cops. You can tell at this point no one believes his account of events, or cares if he is actually okay or not.

“And do you subject all snake bite victims to extensive drug testing?” Jonah asks, keeping his voice steady and dignified. I reach for his hand to show my support, and our fingers entwine in a firm grasp, “Am I to be paying for all these additional tests as well as my extended stay at the hospital?” 

“I’m sorry, sir,” the doctor plasters on a rehearsed smile she must save for her most troublesome patients, “It’s hospital policy. We’re doing everything we can to ensure your safety as well as those in the community.” 

With this doctor Matthews leaves, still smiling as she turns from us, and I wonder how fast the fake face drops once she’s out the door. I decide to comfort Jonah by climbing onto his gurney. He’s luckily quite skinny, so we fit in a snug sort of way, with me taking up a little more room than is proper for a visitor. I ask again if he’s alright, and he assures me that he is fine, just tired.

That’s when I decide to tell Jonah everything, no matter how difficult. I know he will struggle to wrap his mind around the unexplainable parts of the story, but I also feel like he has seen and felt enough to eventually believe me. I need him on my side, because for the first time since arriving back home, a sense of purpose has started bubbling underneath the surface. I don’t think I can just leave this place, abandoning my sister (again) and never finding the answers to all the questions that haunt me. I know I must tell him everything first though, and I think maybe it would be best to tell him with Robin present. There is so much she can corroborate, and probably so much she knows from just living at that house for the past three years.

It is with these thoughts that I drift off to sleep, cozy in our embrace, caressed by the late afternoon sun that warms us through the curtain. 

—

The room is almost entirely dark when I wake up, stricken with fear. The first thing I comprehend is a faint light coming from somewhere low, maybe through a crack in the door, illuminating just enough of the ceiling for me to see a myriad of shadows splayed across the tiled surface. The shadows are unmoving, but ominous, as though they could start moving, all at once, at any second.

The second thing I comprehend is far more disturbing.

I feel a large, cold object pressed up against my left side. It is stiff, but mobile, smeared with something wet. My body tenses as the last effects of sleep wear off, and I realize that the curve and fit of the object resonate with the shape of my boyfriend. Trembling, I reach my left hand to where I imagine Jonah’s chest would be. My fingers are met with a hard, rubbery surface, like the material of an inflatable rubber boat, but freezing cold, beyond something you would find in a refrigerator. Sticky wet too, not unlike sweat, but of a firmer consistency. 

Jonah moves and my whole body shudders in horror. He feels like a living corpse, smeared with some odorless lotion for a casket showing. My eyes register another anomaly in the dim light of the hospital room. It’s his chest, or rather, the way it doesn’t move. The way it remains still as the rest of his limbs jerk and twitch at my side.

I sit up, pulling back from my boyfriend as the jello cup I ate earlier threatens to shoot back up my esophagus. Jonah’s body is already half upright, leaning on the back of the propped up hospital gurney. It continues to twitch sporadically, as his pupils grow in response to my movements. 

How long has he been lying like this? How long have his eyes been open?

The muscles on Jonah’s lower face move mechanically as they pull his lips into a closed, wide smile. Only the result is not remotely my boyfriend’s ironic, or cheerful, or dorky smile. This is a smile I know from somewhere else entirely, from only the worst childhood nights and - most recently - from my first overnight visit at my childhood home.

“What’s wrong, Ava?”  that low, raw imitation of a human voice. Like there’s an invisible force tugging at Jonah’s voice strings from somewhere in the shadows.

For once, my gut reaction is not to sit around, waiting for it to pass. Maybe in my childhood home, but I’m in a very public place now. With doctors, nurses, and other patients. I already know I’m not crazy, maybe I don’t have to face this alone either. I make a move to hop out of the hospital bed, entirely forgetting the fragile state of my knee cap, but getting a very grim reminder as Jonah’s cold, rubbery hand latches onto my leg, pulling me back towards him. And though my instincts want to submit, to sink into the familiar comforts of fear-induced paralysis, I decide to kick back with all my might instead. I rise above the pain, and use my upper leg muscles to push Not-Quite-Jonah off me.

It’s not smooth, or super efficient, but the monster’s hold is loosened for a split second, perhaps from surprise. This is enough of a window for me to lunge my upper body to the floor, landing with a dull thud, sending shots of pain through my elbows. I quickly get to my feet, and try to jog over to the door, though my footfall is slow and unsteady. I don’t look back, and I don’t feel Not-Quite-Jonah close behind me. 

I’m out in the hallway now, racking my brains to remember which way the nurses station might be. The door to Jonah’s room is right up against the corner where two hallways meet. I have a choice of running left or right. Both paths look identical, with rows of doors and the odd extra bed lining the bleach white walls. The ceiling light of the hallway to my right starts flickering, and I’m left wondering if it’s a sign from heaven or hell.

I decide to go the stable-lighting route as I turn from the flickering unknown and make my way down the left hallway. I walk as fast as I can, but I probably only manage the pace of an elderly person. I do look back once, but there is no one behind me. The further I go, the more secure I feel. The more grateful I am for being far from the claustrophobia of my childhood home. Somewhere to my right, I hear a patient snoring loudly from behind the door of a closed private room, and the sound of something so bizarrely normal fills me with enough courage and determination to move faster.

I eventually reach the nurses station, shocking a handful of older ladies out of a card game.

“There’s something wrong with Jonah, room 208,” I say, voice muffled over with panic, eyes darting around madly as I try to find a familiar face. The head nurse from the day shift had been so kind, she even bought our bullshit story of us being brother and sister, allowing me to stay past regular visitor hours. 

“What’s wrong dearie?” a kind-faced, older nurse asks.

“He’s cold all over, and his legs and arms are twitching, and,” how much do I tell them, I wonder, but it seems what I’ve said is enough. A young nurse runs out immediately, and her kind older colleague gives me a hand as I limp back down the hallway slowly. 

I am tense, but relieved. For the first time in my life I am not one-on-one with my nightmare. There are others around me. Even if they don’t see the whole of it, they will be able to take Jonah’s blood pressure, measure his body temperature. There will be something tangible at the end of all this.

The first nurse exits room 208 as we draw near. My stomach sinks as I observe her youthful forehead crinkle with lines of urgency. She walks over to a nearby intercom and recites a string of numbers (codes) that I don’t understand. The older nurse tightens her grip on my upper arm as we enter the room. Two hospital security guards rush in behind us, barking orders into walkie talkies as they wake the other two patients in the room. I look over at the empty bed, at the two indentations in the white hospital sheets and pillow. 

Jonah is not in the room.  
He is not on the second floor, a crackling radio message reports.  
He is not on the first floor either, another message comes in.  
He is not on any security cameras, now or in the past hour, a third adds.

The hospital security are actively checking all bathrooms and closets, they’ve got people outside, monitoring the parking lot, but no one has a clue.

It’s like he disappeared into [thin air](https://www.reddit.com/r/peculi_Dar/comments/vnkyf3/feathers_in_the_attic_series_hub/).

[Home didn’t feel as empty as it once had](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/hd7y2i/the_previous_tenant_left_a_survival_guide_never/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Even without Jamie or Mr Meow I felt more hope than I had in months. I greeted Wrinkles and Tetley, fed them and sat down to smoke at my fold out table. 

Natural sun poured in through the windows but my home would never look quite the same after my time in the undertower. 

I turned on the shower and must have stood underneath the water, watching Albert’s blood run down the sink, for at least half an hour. Overwhelmed doesn’t cover it. Shut down would be more accurate. 

I dithered while getting ready, exhausted and starting to feel the lack of sleep once again. My eyes were heavy. Sitting down on the bed was fatal.

I woke up a few hours later, worried that I’d left Derek waiting.

I rushed out of the flat and down the stairs to the garden. They were extra kind and only made me take one flight going straight from my floor to the main entrance. I couldn’t have been more grateful, I was so exhausted. 

Outside on the bench, there he was. I don’t know how or where he got clean but the flat cap was as fresh as ever. I suppose after all the unbelievable things I’d learned I shouldn’t have even spared it a thought, but it was magic nonetheless.

“I’m sorry! I fell asleep!” I shouted before he had a chance to turn his head and notice me.

“It’s fine Kat. I had a few things to do anyway.” He spoke with a smile. The kind that you can hear just in a persons tone and as I approached him and the garden I realised why.

I felt a lump form in my throat and tears well in my eyes as I noticed the tiny bundle in his lap. It was bald, wrinkly and had exactly three legs. 

Mr Meow. 

“There was nothing I could do about his foot - I think the others ate that - but I thought this little guy deserved another shot at life.” Derek grinned from ear to ear as I stared in disbelief at the tiny cat in front of me. Disregarding their burning properties entirely I scooped him up and held him close, only putting him down as he singed my face a little. 

Thoughts started to whir in my mind but before they could ever fully develop Derek turned to me gravely and squashed them.

“I know what you’re thinking, but there was nothing I could do for Jamie... after what Albert did...”

“Don’t apologise.” I cut him off. “What I did was selfish. Albert was right, Jamie died a long time ago. Sometimes I wonder if - even if I could have him back - maybe I’m a different person now to the one he knew.” 

Derek didn’t respond, he just watched while I played with Mr Meow, tickling his belly as he rolled around purring on my lap. 

“I know you must still have a lot of questions and if I’m honest, I’m not sure any of them have answers that will satisfy. I’m no oracle; I still have questions myself, but I want to tell you what I know.”

I looked at him in confusion. Almost all loose ends had already been tied and anything else seemed almost arbitrary, but Derek did everything with purpose. So I stayed quiet and I listened. 

“Albert and I were never close. I told you downstairs that not trying harder was my biggest regret. I’ve come to realise that was a lie, and it’s time I faced the true regret that haunts me.”

I tried to imagine what he could be talking about but I couldn’t, I nodded and listened instead.

“When we moved in... after our father died... we continued to lead very separate lives. I worked on the garden and I embraced the strange things that happened around me.

“I don’t know why I found it so easy to accept. I’ve seen hundreds come through this block and almost all of them have been horrified at first, but I wasn’t. 

“When we first got here there were only a handful of occurrences that showed themselves. The boy that lives in the mirror and the postman, along with others, came with the building.

“The longer we stayed the more we discovered. I saw it as magic, a whole new world that most people never get to see. Albert didn’t see it that way. He became paranoid, always looking over his shoulder thinking that things were out to get him.”

Derek took a moment to look at the grass, a sadness on his face and I grabbed his fingerless hand to comfort him.

“What happened to him?” I asked.

“He wasn’t always the man you met. He was always a cold, ruthless bastard but I would’ve never considered him evil. This place... the place that you and I call home... it started to drive him into darker and darker places.

“He didn’t move his family in with him, he wanted to keep them separate from his business and although I was intent on staying here Albert never expected to be here longer than a few months. They would come and visit and his wife, Darla, started to express concerns to me.

“She would come by my flat after visiting him, leaving their son with him to spend some time together while she claimed she was shopping in the city. She said he seemed frightened and angry. She was worried that he was losing his mind.”

Tears started to roll from his kindly eyes. Derek had always seemed so wholly good, such a wonderful person that it was hard to consider him mourning someone like Albert. But no one chooses the family they’re born into. And I don’t believe that anyone is entirely good or bad; having feelings for an awful person couldn’t take away from his spirit. 

“What did you do?” 

“This is exactly it, Kat. I didn’t do anything. I dismissed Darla entirely and I was wrapped up in my own world of discovery. I wrote him off under the assumption he wouldn’t have listened to me anyway. 

“Albert got worse, Darla got more worried and eventually he stopped answering the door. Mental health services were terrible in those days, there wasn’t a great deal we could do. Albert controlled his money and Darla couldn’t get her hands on it to pay for care. 

“If I hadn’t ignored it then maybe...”

“His son would be alive?” I interrupted. 

“I wish it were that simple.” He answered and paused for a moment. 

We sat in silence just holding hands for a few minutes until he spoke again.

“I need to show you, it’s the only way you’ll understand.” He gestured to Mr Meow. “Let’s take him home.” 

We took the stairs, skipping a few floors as we went, before reaching the door to my flat. The real one, without the minus symbol in front. It was the first time that Derek had been inside since I had moved in and it felt good to be in a room with him while not in a state of imminent crisis.

The kittens were pleased to be reunited and were quickly cuddled in a heap on the sofa. Mr Meow’s return bought me more joy than I thought possible. 

I retrieved the chair that I’d used to prop up Jamie’s prison and made tea before we sat together at the fold out table. 

“What do you need to show me?” I asked. He didn’t answer me directly and instead continued to talk about his family.

“His name was Jonathan, my nephew. I may not have been best of friends with my brother but I loved that boy more than life itself. He enjoyed the garden and getting dirty. He wasn’t like Albert, or our father, he was a worker like me.” 

I smiled. It was nice to imagine someone taking after Derek. 

“He sounds wonderful.” 

“He was. He was only nineteen years old when he died. No life at all, especially when you consider how many years me and his father have lived for. He had just started his own business, had a fiancé and even in the worst of times he didn’t give up on his dad. 

“It broke his heart when my brother stopped answering the door... So he got creative and resorted to desperate measures to try and reach Albert.” 

I started to piece things together in my head, a pit forming in my stomach as I stopped him to ask the one question that was on my mind.

“What was his business?”

Derek looked at me, shame in his eyes. He knew that he would have to say it out loud and confirm what I already knew.

“He was a window cleaner.” 

I didn’t say a word. I wasn’t sure how to respond. I racked my brain trying to comprehend what I was hearing. The knocking on the balcony doors from behind the curtain started. The familiar groaning and whining sounds soon followed.

Derek could sense my discomfort and broke the silence.

“When Jonathan climbed the tower to try and see his dad he scared him. Albert wasn’t in a good way, he was edgy and defensive. I don’t know what happened for sure but that knock from the outside must have really triggered something. 

“He went outside and he stabbed him. Multiple times with a kitchen knife. But you know that bit. It’s what happened next that wasn’t reported.” 

My mouth hung open. 

“Albert came to me. He told me exactly what he’d done. We fought. I could’ve killed him myself but when I looked at him I could see that he wasn’t right. It was in his eyes, Kat, he wasn’t my brother anymore. 

“I tried to reason with him and get him to hand himself in but he refused and got aggressive with me, saying that I just wanted to get my hands on the block. I left him in my flat to calm down so I could go to Jonathan.”

The window cleaner continued to scratch on the balcony door, his whines accompanying Derek’s tale. 

“He was out there on the balcony. He was dead. One look at him and I knew no ambulance could help him anymore. I sat with him for an eternity, trying to work out what to do. 

“I should’ve called the police, but I couldn’t bring myself to shop my own brother. There was no hope for Jonathan but I thought I could help Albert. I was wrong. When I returned to my flat he was gone.

“I begged the building to help me. I would’ve done anything to bring Jonathan back, but wishes work in mysterious ways here and once the body was found Albert was already missing and my nephew had become the monster that lives on the balconies to this day.”

I stopped him. I tried to process what he was telling me. 

“But he wasn’t found for days, why didn’t you call the police? Why did you tell the residents not to let him in?” I asked, confused.

“Love works in mysterious ways Kat. I hope that you of all people can understand that. I was never fond of my brother, but I did love him and without any way of saving his son I wanted to give him a head start.” 

“And the residents?” I asked again, remembering the strict rule that Prudence had left stating I shouldn’t let him in under any circumstances.

“That’s where things get complicated. I didn’t realise at the time, but what he became was the buildings way of giving him back to me. He is what he is because of me. When you see, you’ll understand.”

He grabbed my hand and walked me to the balcony doors, letting go and pulling back the curtain to reveal the friendly looking man I’d always seen outside my window, collapsed against it, scratching on the glass.

Upon second inspection, I could see the family resemblance, but it wasn’t one that I’d ever considered possible before.

Prudence had told me about her experience with him, with Derek showing her what he truly looked like. I still hadn’t expected quite what I saw when Derek rested his hand on my shoulder and told me to look.

The window cleaner was gaunt, with bones protruding beneath his tight, thin greyed flesh, raw skin and wounds that were in varied stages of healing. He looked truly horrifying, but what alarmed me the most were his impossibly deep, black voids for eyes. They were all too familiar. 

I turned to stare at Derek, unsure of quite what to say as a million realisations crossed my mind. He started to speak again. 

“I didn’t want the residents to hurt him Kat. When he gets inside this form is revealed and so many tried to hurt him at first. I found myself constantly telling people to ignore the friendly window cleaner in the hope that he would be safe from their fear of the unknown.

“I’d seen Albert’s reaction to anything remotely different and I couldn’t bare Jonathan to face the same from the entire block. It was safer to leave him out here. 

“After all, only someone who sees the good in everyone would let him in and accept him, and those people are one in a million.” Derek half smiled, knowingly. 

“Terri.” I gulped, finally realising who the twin’s father was. 

“I didn’t know about them. Albert had me trapped below by the time Terri was in school, but the second I saw Ellie, with you in that stairwell, I knew that she was family.

“When I realised that Jonathan’s new form was a direct result of my actions I started to come to terms with the power this place had given me. I embraced it and I used it. 

“I used it to hide Jonathan from his father, who I discovered had fled to the sealed floors not long after the murder. He never knew what became of his son. That shielding must have transferred when the twins were born, it was why he didn’t know they existed.

“Once Albert had discovered his power, along with all his issues and the isolation he drove himself into, it just twisted him up, into the man you knew him as. He made it his mission to know all of the special residents, but he never saw Jonathan again.” 

“Why are you telling me this?” I asked, emotion making it a little hard to speak. I wondered if Terri had continued a relationship with the window cleaner, and why she had kept so quiet about the twins’ dad. 

I processed the fact that Ellie had not only saved my life, but in doing so she had killed her own grandfather. 

I couldn’t judge Terri, or Derek for their actions. He was right, love works in mysterious ways. Just as it had when I made my choice regarding Jamie, and when I subsequently accepted that he was gone. 

“I’m showing you because I think you’ll understand. And because I don’t want you to spend your life riddled with guilt for Jamie. We all make mistakes. Mine was a big one, but out of it came two of the purest creatures to walk this Earth, and for that I’m grateful.”

He smiled again as he thought of Ellie and Eddie. Then he looked me dead in the eyes and spoke again. 

“It’s time I corrected my wrongdoings.” 

Solemnly, he walked towards the doors and slid them open, coming face to face with the monstrous shell of a man holding a squeegee. The window cleaner took a step inside, struggling to move on his bone thin legs and stopped, millimetres from Derek’s face.

I couldn’t help it, despite what I knew he scared me. The twins had balance, even in their demonic form there was a visible person there. Their father didn’t resemble a person at all, the visceral reaction he ignited in me further proved Derek’s point. People will generally attack what they fear. Had I been alone and let him in, I’d have almost certainly done the same. 

I watched with baited breath as Derek wrapped his arms around the bag of bones in a warm embrace. I watched as he let out a gentle sob and the window cleaner began to disintegrate into dust before my eyes. 

“No!” I shouted, hoping there was some other way, a happier solution, knowing full well that there wasn’t. There was a heavy quiet in the room for a few moments. 

“It was no life Kat. I was cruel to let it continue as long as I did.” Derek responded, turning to me.

Although similar to the way that I had watched my love disappear on our bedroom floor, Derek’s action wasn’t filled with malice. It was done for the sake of mercy. 

Derek came towards me and hugged me. I felt emotionally and physically battered, fragile and my ears continued to ring but regardless, with him free and with me, I felt safe. Life in the block could finally begin, with no more dark secrets hanging over me. Amongst all the death and chaos, there was joy to be found.

“It’s over now. A new chapter.” He whispered into my ear as I sobbed tears of relief into his shoulder and the three cats played at our feet.

**************************

Days passed and normality started to resume. I broke lockdown in order to give Terri some rest and spend some time with the twins. It was the least of all my sins throughout this time. 

It took a lot of explaining and apologising, but she eventually came round and forgave me for endangering her kids. It sounds simple when put like that and I’m sure parents reading this would deem me unforgivable. But their kids aren’t Ellie and Eddie. And there aren’t many folk out there as forgiving and loyal as Terri. 

I haven’t broached the subject of their paternity to her. I’m not sure I ever will but I hope that one day she’ll feel comfortable enough to volunteer the information herself. 

I continue to pick items up for Mr Prentice and take money to Carmilla at the gnome. I’m looking forward to a drink there when this is all over, although I’m sure Mr P will drink me under the table. 

The kittens are happy and growing every day. Truth be told, I think Mr Meow looks badass with his missing leg, especially knowing the heroism it symbolises.

Things had started to look so positive that I almost forgot where I lived. 

I had been in such a daze of relief that I hadn’t noticed that the stairs had skipped floor 5 from the moment we returned from the undertower. 

I probably would have gone longer in blissful ignorance if I hadn’t have found myself on that floor earlier today. 

The black sign was much the same as the one on the floors below that had sported a minus symbol before it. Thankfully, however, the artificial light that plagued those floors was nowhere to be seen and sunlight poured in. 

I smiled when I first saw the sign. Prepared myself to greet the man with a new name. But he wasn’t there. 

His absence was a reminder that no matter how many tribulations I may have conquered, living here there would always be another just around the corner. 

Instead of the man without a name, in his place was the woman. [Angela.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePickledGnome/)

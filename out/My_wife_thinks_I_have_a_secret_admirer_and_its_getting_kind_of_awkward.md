I woke up and found a box of Swiss chocolates sitting on my doorstep, along with a little heart-shaped note that read: *A tasty treat for the sweetest guy I know.*

A married man receiving anonymous gifts is pretty damning in and of itself, but the note was all the rope my wife needed to hang me with.

Melissa shuffled into the kitchen, groggy and still half-asleep. Beams of sunlight gilded her lovely face as she poured herself a coffee by the window. “What’s that?” she asked, casually.

“You mean you didn’t send these?”

She slammed down her cup, snatched the card away, then turned it over, again and again. “No, seriously, who sent these?”

I shrugged. Her brown, unforgettable eyes searched my face for any signs of guilt. Then, after a brief pause, she handed back the note and drained her coffee. That apathy stung, honestly.

How the hell did we reach this point? How’d we go from ‘the couple so cute our friends hated us’ to not giving a single shit about the other receiving love letters? Part of me wanted a big battle royale–for us to scream until our lips turned blue. Hell, maybe Melissa could try cutting off my wedding ring, finger and all. At least that would prove she actually gave a shit.

I tossed the chocolates into the trash. “Hey, it doesn’t matter who sent them, because the perfect woman’s standing right here.” From a side angle, I threw my arms around her waist and leaned in for a kiss. 

Melissa bit my bottom lip, hard enough to draw a trickle of blood, before backing away. It was the most action I’d had since Boris Johnson announced the U.K. lockdown…

It’s crazy how in two short years we slid from excited about trying for a baby, to rudimentary, mechanical lovemaking, to strangers under the same roof. Maybe it was my fault? Maybe we only fell into that stagnant routine because I gained half a stone and stopped surprising her with roses.

The two of us worked in our home office that day, directly across from each other. My wife worked as a solicitor, me an IT consultant.

Anytime our eyes met above the laptops, I tried to diffuse the awkward silence by blowing her a kiss or winking cheekily, but her mouth just remained a grim straight line.

Around midday, I pulled on my headset and joined a Teams call with my co-worker, Angela. “Afternoon Angie.”

“I’ve got something to show you,” she said. Her camera flicked on, revealing a cute, grey kitten with four white paws. “Meet Mittens.”

The little fuzzball had on a red collar which he tried to pry off using his back leg. When Angie scooped him up, he twisted like a fish, furiously attempting to wriggle free.

“Who let *you* get a cat?” I asked, sarcastically. “That thing’ll be dead in—"

Normally Angela and I enjoyed a bit of banter—nothing flirty, just innocent jokes—but my voice trailed off as the mechanical clacks of Melissa’s keyboard suddenly ceased.

The tension in the room swelled. Veins throbbed along the forehead of the angry face glaring at me. Had the chocolates secretly bothered my wife? Was there still a glimmer of hope for our rotting carcass of a relationship?

I cleared my throat, made my voice all serious, and said into the microphone, “Let’s pull up those Firewall logs, see if we can figure out where the traffic’s getting blocked.”

That evening, Melissa only made dinner for herself, not me, and later in bed, since she decided to face the mirrored closet door on the far side of the room, I clasped my hand around her stomach and tried to draw her warm body towards mine.

A drilling elbow to the ribs torpedoed that idea…

Over the next few weeks, cosying up to her felt like cuddling a clump of jagged nettles. One night I joined her in the lounge to watch a TV show about boats, but the second my ass hit the cushion, she stood up and said, “I’m done, put on what you like.” Another time, I surprised her with two tickets to Ed Sheeran plus reservations at her favourite restaurant.

She took her mom.

One Friday afternoon at work, as Angela and I sat side-by-side parsing through Kubernetes logs, my wonderful spouse stopped by for our weekly lunch date. Even at our lowest point, neither of us dared skip a luncheon. They were a holy sacrament—the life support system for a terminally ill marriage. And neither of us wanted to pull the plug. *Yet*.

Even though there was no affair going on, I instinctively moved my chair away from Angela before greeting the wifey. It was all smiles and pleasantries between the pair while I fetched my jacket, but something about Melissa’s expression made my stomach queasy.

Quickly I ushered her out through reception into a nearby café, where a young couple at the next table over held hands while scanning their menus. I couldn’t help feel a pang of jealousy.

The romance in my own relationship had run away. But maybe, just maybe, there was a way to get it back…

As I quietly munched on a portion of grapefruit the next morning, a bouquet of pink oriental lilies arrived by special delivery. The accompanying note read: *Michael, I’m like a flower…and you’re the sunshine*.

When I closed the door on the deliveryman Melissa was already directly behind me, her hands balled into fists. “Lemme guess, another gift from your *secret* admirer?” Air quotes accompanied the word ‘secret’.

“I swear I’ve no idea who sent these.”

“Of course you don’t.”

We argued back and forth, our voices growing steadily louder and bolder, until, a little condescendingly, she said, “I don’t even care about the affair, just quit lying.”

“What’s that old legal expression? Innocent until proven guilty?” I threw a shit-eating grin.

Red spots across Melissa’s cheeks subsided as she took three deep breaths. “You know what, I’m done.”

I tossed the flowers aside, circling her before she could storm off, then I stared down my nose at the top of her blonde head. “What do you mean *you’re done*?”

“You wanna have an affair, you go right ahead.” The words came boiling out.

“I’m *not* having an affair.”

For a moment we stood there, her warm, furious breaths spreading out across my face. Next thing I knew we were going at it. Fingernails scraped my eye; hot palms tugged my hair and shoved me into a wall. At some point a side desk toppled over, and then a porcelain lamp shattered across the floor. 

Melissa’s friends once warned me about her temper—something about her ex-boyfriend sending *his* ex a flirty Facebook message, which resulted in her repeatedly headbutting the poor girl at a house party, enough times to land her in ICU.

Well now that temper had resurfaced. And it intrigued me.

After our steamy encounter, Melissa quickly got dressed, climbed into her car, and sped off. Still sticky with sweat and practically in need of an oxygen mask, I booted up my laptop rather than venture into the office.

My wife didn’t make it home until late that night, and she wouldn’t say a single word about where she’d spent the day.

The following morning, at the office, there was no sign of Angela. She finally answered her phone on my sixth wellness call. “Mittens is gone.”

After ten minutes of frantic back and forth, Angela composed herself long enough to explain she’d found Mitten's red collar—*just* the collar—on the welcome mat outside her apartment.

No big deal, the little critter hated that thing. He’d turn up sooner or later, right?

Over the next few weeks, things got better between Melissa and I. *Slightly*. Were we going at it like newlyweds? No. However, after shaking off some cobwebs, the passion came storming back.

We experimented with some fun new positions like ‘the dancing pink flamingo’ and ‘two folded pretzels’. Soon this humble IT administrator looked pale and wilted from all the lovemaking, all the furniture oozed with a thick soup of bodily fluids, and sometimes there was even a six-inch recess in the mattress from where I’d lay on my back during a particularly spirited session.

The idea of an oncoming divorce disappeared right off the map. Things were finally looking up.

But then, within three weeks, we both fell back to the old ways. No passion, zero intimacy. The marital bed may as well have been cordoned off by police tape. Maybe part of her still suspected I was having an affair, despite me *repeatedly* insisting that wasn’t the case. 

A third gift soon arrived: this fancy male beauty and grooming kit. The note said: *to cover up the musk after we work up a sweat.*

“Work up a sweat?” my beloved screamed, smashing the little glass jars of cologne as she marched through the house. Strong-smelling dark puddles soon covered the walls and floor in every room.

In my man cave, she dangled the final bottle directly above my PC; my expensive, wonderful, top-of-the-line gaming rig. Just before she could dump the contents over the *second* love of my life, I seized her arm and steered her into the wall, pinning her body in place with mine.

Quickly her tongue found my mouth. Then a pair of legs wrapped around my waist, tighter than a python. Everything else is a bit of a blur.

Sometime later, Melissa pulled on her clothes, climbed into her car, and drove off.

All day, my brain refused to focus on one subject for even five seconds. Those gifts acted like a romantic catalyst, but things never took long to fizzle out. There had to be a way to jump-start our love life *and* keep it chugging along healthily. Maybe we needed an in-depth heart-to-heart?

These childish games had gone on long enough. It was time for action. Time to show her what she meant to me.

That evening, Angie’s parents called wanting to know whether their daughter phoned in sick that day.

“She didn’t,” I said. “But she’s been missing tons of work since Mittens disappeared.”

I promised to let them know the moment I heard anything.

Sometime after midnight, Melissa returned home and climbed into bed. I placed my head on her shoulder, my hands interlocking around her smooth stomach, then I pushed my lips right up against her ear and whispered, “I love you. Maybe I don’t say that enough, but it’s true. And I’d never, *ever* dream of cheating on you. I know I haven’t been the best husband lately, and I’m sorry. I promise to do better. I’ll start going back to the gym. And I’ll surprise you with roses again. All I want is for things to go back to the way they were.”

In the mirrored closet door, I watched her hands close over mine. We lay together, our chests went up and down in rhythmic heaves. And somehow, I knew there was a glimmer of hope for us. That things would turn out alright.

But then, the very next morning, another gift arrived. This one caught me off guard. It was a little white box wrapped in a pink bow.

“Another present from your admirer?” Melissa asked, making no effort to mask her excitement as she watched from across the kitchen. After spooning a portion of soggy Weetabix into her mouth, she said, “Go on. Open it.”

“You sent this,” I said. “Didn’t you?” 

She made a big, overexaggerated show of protesting her innocence. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. *You’re* the one with the admirer.”

Okay, I thought. I’ll play along. Hell, maybe this’ll turn into a sexy treasure hunt…

I slowly untied the bow and opened the box. And when I saw what was in there, Cornflakes nearly slid up my gut.

It was a severed finger, surrounded by packaging coated in dried, crusty blood. As I dropped the box and backed away, the detached digit dropped onto the floor and rolled toward Melissa, stopping halfway between us.

“Oh,” she said, her voice flat and bored. “Is that a finger?”

“What the fuck?” I shouted, between heavy gasps. The oxygen in the room grew thick and heavy. I looked from the perfectly composed lady standing opposite me to the blood-smeared appendage, back and forth. Was that thing real? It couldn’t be real…

Melissa said, “Something wrong? You liked the other presents.”

“The other presents weren’t severed fingers,” I rasped, voice cracking.

“You’re right. Maybe this whole secret admirer thing has gotten out of *hand*?”

Casual as you like, she tossed her empty bowl into the sink and tried to stroll out of the room, but I cut in front of her—skirting her ‘gift’ along the way—and gripped both her shoulders so she had to look at me. “What the fuck did you do?”

“What do you mean, darling?”

“Where did you get that? Tell me right now or I’m calling the police.”

She grinned. “And tell them what? *You’re* the one with the secret admirer. Remember?”

Now terrified of the woman I married, I rushed outside and climbed into my car, then drove to a coffee shop and sat in the corner booth, dizzy with shock. There was only one person that finger could belong to, and Angela still wasn’t answering her phone. I checked in with her parents, careful to avoid any explicit mention of the package, and asked them to call me the second they heard from her.

This wasn’t happening. No way Melissa could do such a thing.

But then I thought more about her neutral reaction to the finger, not to mention the sour look she gave Angie in the office that day…

To think I wanted to have a baby with that psycho.

Questions shoulder charged their way to the forefront of my mind. Should I go to the police? A fucking finger arrived by post, of course I should! But what would I say?

*My wife sent the finger, officer. No, I can’t prove it. What’s what? She says I’ve been having an affair? You think I killed my lover to protect my marriage?*

I felt helpless as a poisoned fly in a spider's web.

Clearly, Melissa’s feelings for me had come surging back the more we rekindled, which resulted in her jealous nature rearing its ugly head, which resulted in this…situation.

I needed proof of what she’d done. A confession about what happened to Angie. But how could I get it?

After a long, sleepless night watching woodlice crawl across the ceiling of a cheap hotel room, I returned home, around about the time my wife usually started her day. My phone was secretly recording in my trouser pocket.

In the kitchen, I gently took her by the hands. “Honey, I love you.”

“I love you too.”

“Is there anything you need to tell me?”

“About what?”

“About…anything?”

“I’m not sure what you mean.”

“Melissa, there’s a detached finger in the fucking bin.”

“Yeah, and don’t think I’ve forgot. Whatever crazy kinks you and your admirer are into, count me out.”

Just then, as if on cue, somebody knocked the front door. “Sounds like another package,” she said, a devilish grin flashing across her face.

My heart thudded wildly in my chest. *Another* delivery? What would it be this time? A severed head? A still-beating heart?

With dread in the pit of my stomach I opened the door to an irate delivery man who sneered and said, “Took you long enough.”

He handed me a stylus to sign for a package—one roughly the size of a microwave and heavy enough to have been harboring an entire human skull.

I placed the box on the lounge table and stared at it fixedly until my wonderful spouse came and stood behind me, one hand clamped around the back of my neck. “Go on, open it.”

The muscles in my legs would not stop quivering, so I sat down and tore apart the cardboard with my bare hands. Inside lay another box, this one neatly gift wrapped.

Melissa chuckled, her cold claws massaging my shoulders. “Keep going.”

I opened that second box, revealing a pile of rocks that had weighed the package down. In the center sat a rectangular carton the size and shape of a ballpoint pen. 

“Fooled you.”

Practically giddy with excitement, she let her bony arms encase my chest. She pushed her lips right up against my left ear, but down on the lobe, then whispered, “Last one. I promise.”

Clammy breaths raced along my spine, down toward the pit of my stomach where they sloshed about uneasily. I untied the bow and lifted the top off the box. Inside lay a folded-up note on a bed of brown, crinkle-cut packaging paper.

The note said: *Michael, I know things have been tense lately, but I want you to know I love you dearly, and there’s nobody I’d rather take this journey with. Your loving wife, Melissa.*

My fingers plunged into the paper shreds, into the terrifying unknown, and fished out a pregnancy test with two blue lines running across the little screen.

Without warning, Melissa unloaded a barrage of kisses upon my cheek. “Surprise! You’re gonna be a Daddy.”

Her fingers laced with mine and cupped my palm flat against her belly.

As my wife chattered away, already planning how to decorate the nursery and rapidly cycling through potential baby names, seconds seemed to stretch into hours.

Finally, she said, “I’m gonna go tell my mom.” Then she disappeared into the next room.

I took a deep breath, slowly exhaled, and then sunk into the chair. This was a seriously fucked up situation.

I only mailed myself those gifts to reignite the spark in our marriage. They were supposed to spice things up–to rile Melissa up and get us back into the throes of passion. I never dreamed things might spiral out of control like this.

Now Angelas missing, probably dead, we’re expecting a baby.

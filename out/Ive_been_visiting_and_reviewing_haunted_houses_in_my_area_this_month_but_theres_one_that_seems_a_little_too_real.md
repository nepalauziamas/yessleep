Most of the haunted houses I've reviewed have been ones I've found on a website or in local advertisements. I found this one by accident. I was driving down a back road to get home from a haunted house that had asked me to visit and review. This isn't a road I drove down very often, and I was surprised to see a sign indicating a new haunted house just down the road. It was late, and I wanted to just get home, but I decided I would check this one out.

There was no sign in the front that listed a name, nor did the sign on the side of the road list a name. This is common with haunted houses built within residential homes by hobbyists. I find that, with hobbyist haunted houses, they are either of professional-level quality or it looks like it was built by a couple of preteen boys. There is no middle ground.

At the outset, I got the impression that this was built by professionals. Heck, I was getting goosebumps just driving down the driveway, which felt like a mile long.

The outside of the house was nothing special. The driveway was empty of any cars and there was a sign in the front yard that just said "please enter front door." Ominous? Yes. Intriguing? Also, yes. If I'm being honest, I would recommend most people avoid a haunted house like this. I did some research and I couldn't find anybody talking about a haunted house anywhere on this street, let alone at this address. Me, though? I'm a man of the people. And if this haunted house doesn't have any reviews yet, than I'll be the first.

As a way of prefacing what you're about to read, as of the time I'm writing this post, I have yet to write the review for this haunted house. In truth, I'm afraid to. Plus, it doesn't have a name.

I decided to park in the grass a short distance away from the house. As I approached the house, I noticed that, on the second floor of the house, a light turned on. The only other lights that were on before this were the porch light and the lights for the sign in the front yard. This put me at ease for a moment, I assumed that whoever runs this place just realized they had a visitor.

Throughout the whole process, I never met the owner of the house.

When I got to the porch, looking inside the wide open front door, there was a layer of black fog blocking vision of what was inside. I waited there for a second to see if there was gonna be someone to take me inside, but nobody ever came out. Instead, a decrepit, inhuman hand reached out from the fog and gestured for me to walk inside. Despite my better judgment, I walk in.

There were many obvious warning signs that I shouldn't enter this house, but I figured that only two things could be happening if I haven't seen this house mentioned anywhere. Either everybody that walks into this house never leaves it, or nobody has had the guts to walk in in the first place. Call me a skeptic, but I find it unlikely that nobody would have noticed people going missing.

After getting past the layer of fog at the entrance of the house, I was expecting to see arrows pointing me to where to go next, but I find nothing of the sort. Instead, I find a completely normal home. The front door leads into an entry hall with two adjacent staircases on either side. When I looked behind me, all the black fog had disappeared and the front door had closed. I didn't hear the door close.

Now I'm just confused. This is a haunted house, but there was not a single piece of anything that I would expect in a haunted house. This couldn't have been a mistake, there were signs clearly saying that this was a haunted house and a creepy hand gesturing me in.

Without anything indicating where I needed to go next, I start exploring. I remembered the light that turned on on the second floor, so I went there first. To my dismay, there were no lights on. The room where the light came was a nursery with two cribs in it. I'm not sure why a family with two infants would be putting on a haunted house, but at this point, that's not the weirdest thing about this place.

Moving on, I went back downstairs and continued down the entry hall into the living room. Everything was normal here except for the TV, which was showing static like those old tube TVs. I found the remote to try to turn it off, but it wasn't doing anything.

At this point, I was thinking about leaving, but I wanted to stay a bit longer to see if there was actually anything in this place. I mean, why would they go through the trouble of putting up signs, a fog machine, and a fake hand for nothing?

I decided to open the blinds in the living room to see if there was anything in the backyard. Well, there was nothing in the backyard, but I did see something in the windows. As soon as I opened the blinds, the faint light from the front yard created a glare in the windows. I immediately saw the same hand that gestured me in on the railing of the stairs, and whoever it was was walking up the stairs, making absolutely no sound.

Okay, now this was starting to feel like a haunted house, if unconventional.

I immediately bolted to the entry hall and looked at what was walking up the stairs, but there was nothing. I wanted to pull out my flashlight, but I thought that would ruin whatever experience these people had for me. I walked up the stairs and discovered that whatever was walking up the stairs left behind some mysterious sticky black substance on the railings. Think of molasses but less smooth and a more looking-into-a-black-hole kind of black.

I couldn't find anything upstairs. The trail of substance stopped when the railing stopped and there was no more of the substance anywhere else. For all I know, whoever this was vanished at the top of the stairs. This was starting to get a little too weird. I'm used to haunted houses being immersive enough to scare you, but still making it clear that it's all just a show.

I decided to leave after that. But this house had one more thing for me. When I opened the front door and walked out, I noticed a piece of paper on the ground.

*It's different every time you visit, I look forward to seeing you again*.

If the owner's goal was to make me feel like it was all real, they succeeded with flying colors. That was the worst scare I've experienced in a haunted house in years, maybe ever. What do y'all think? Should I visit again, or would I be better off reviewing more established haunted houses?

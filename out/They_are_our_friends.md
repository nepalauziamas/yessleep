Do you ever see them? 

Come on, you know what I’m talking about. 

I tried to deny it too. For a while. But you can’t they don’t leave. Ever.

The shadow people.

They follow you around lurking in the smothering darkness. 

Darting back and forth receding to the corners of your eyes.

Looking at you calling you.

Yeah haha. They never let me get a good look. But I’m trained I can hear them too! 

tck tck tck tck

That’s the sound they make. That’s when I know I’ve pleased them. 

It was hard at first. Doing what needed to be done. 

Those who were punished certainly didn’t appreciate it. 

But you have no choice! You have to please them. To do the right thing. 

The first time was probably the hardest. 

Some drug addict sleeping on the street. 

It was funny he didn’t really struggle.

His eyes bulged wide but he didn’t have any fight in him.

tck tck tck tck

I saw the light spill out of him. 

That satisfied them for a little while. 

tck tck tck tck

But they are just so hungry haha.

They needed more.

tck tck tck tck

So I followed her home. 

The serrated blade made such pretty ribbons. It was like they were biting at her face.

She cried and I cried for her.

Why couldn’t she see them?

So much blood.

tck tck tck tck

Yeah that was it. 

I tried so hard to look straight at them but they kept dancing away.

So I kept going.

My favorite was the business man. 

In his fancy house separated from us.

I used a cinder block. Cracking and  screaming in a frenzy making such a mess. He couldn’t see them so I helped.

tck tck tck tck

They wanted more.

So I did what I needed too. 

They picked them not me. You can look and see. 

The others fade from memory.

tck tck tck tck

Just steps to see glory. 

To catch a glimpse of their corporal flesh.

tck tck tck tck

To see hell itself. My mind screaming inside. It’s echoed bells crashing through my skull.

tck tck tck tck

But he got in the way. 

tck tck tck tck

He said they weren’t real

tck tck tck tck

He threatened us

tck tck tck tck

I. CAN. HEAR . THEM

tck tck tck tck

So I made my most beautiful masterpiece. 

With the pen from the table 

They sung to me from his sullied heart. Drinking the elixir I could feel that he saw them too now.

No more chances I have to go now.

Go where they want me to. 

They lead me here and oh god I’m so grateful. 

I know you can feel them. That means you’re picked. You must please them!

tck tck tck tck

Now I’m being lead to a chair

tck tck tck tck

It’s going to kill me.

tck tck tck tck

But I know I’ll be with them.

tck tck tck tck

forever. 

tck tck tck tck

The switch is pulled.

tck tck tc..

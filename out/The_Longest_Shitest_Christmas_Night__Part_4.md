I didn’t want to be alone for the whole night so I decided I’d try to find where all the other naughty kids were by myself. “They surely left some clue as to where they are” I thought. I drove around different towns and villages in search for clues but I couldn’t find anything. I was getting tired so I pulled up away from the road, locked the doors and fell asleep. I had a nightmare about what I saw those 4 psychos do to that young boy the other day. Then I was awoken by the sound of a knocking on the window. I opened my eyes to two flashlights shining through the window. I finally got a look at who was holding them. 

“Shit”

It was them

“Hey there little man” said the leader “You wanna open up for us? We can help you”

“I’m good thanks” I replied “I can help myself”

“Aye. I can see that. But are you not lonely? My brother Liam here is around your age. He could do with a friend”

“Naw boy, I prefer to be alone”

The girl approached the teen and whispered something in his ear

“Not yet, Saoirse” he said

“Alright lads, I’ll be on my way”

“Ah ah ah ah ah ah. Stay a sec. That yoke looks like it’s on its last legs. Don’t think it’s gonna take you much further. We have two vehicles here so we have enough room for one more”

They had a 4x4 and an Audi A6.”There’s no way I’m going to outrun them in this thing” I thought. But at least I had a better chance than if I was on foot. 

“Thanks for the offer lads but I’m off”

I started up the car and drove off. It wasn’t long before they caught up to me. The Audi overtook me and drove directly in front of me, the Jeep stayed directly behind me. 

“What to do? What to do? What to do?” I thought. I had a feeling their plan was to stop the car in front of me so that I’d stop and the jeep behind would ram me off the road. Stupid plan since they could’ve easily just done that with the Jeep without the Audi, but I was wrong about their plan.. They did use the Jeep to ram me off the road without needing the Audi. I think the Audi was in front in case that failed. Anyway, they spun me out and with the ice and snow on the roads, I couldn’t control the car and I crashed into a ditch, unable to back the car out. The car and Jeep pulled up behind me and the three teens and young boy approached the car. Barry, the leader broke the window with his elbow and pulled me out, giving me a few small cuts because of the broken glass. 

“This one looks tasty” said the girl “I could lick his blood right up”

“Aye, he does” said the leader. “Liam, you eat first again”

“I-I st-still don’t l-like it”

“Liam. You’ll have to if you want to survive. We allowed you to eat normal food for what? Over a year. Now there’s none left so you have to eat him”

“C-can you make h-his d-d-death quick though?”

“Of course. We’re not animals. Brian, do you want to do the honours?”

“I will, Bar”

“But babe, I want to kill him. You never let me kill them”

“You can have the next one, Saoirse”

“Fine”

Brian took out his knife and held it to my throat. “I’m dead” I thought. 

Then, out of the bushes a knife was thrown knocking the knife out of Brian’s hand

“The fuck was that? Bar?”

“Saoirse. This one’s yours”

“Yay”

Saoirse ran into the bushes to find whoever threw the knife while Barry, the leader, took out his own knife to kill me. Another knife was thrown from the bushes knocking his knife out of his hand. This gave me enough time to get up. I kicked Brian into the balls, then Barry into the balls and ran to the Audi. I knew that if I could take the Audi, they’d have no chance of killing me. I managed to get into the Audi and locked the doors. I reversed the car up the road to gain some distance between me and those three psychos but I wanted to help whoever helped me. Barry, Brian and Liam hopped into the jeep to chase me while Saoirse hunted whoever threw those knives. Then I heard a knock on the window

“Open. Quick”

It was Karolina. I unlocked the doors and let her in. 

“Drive”

I drove as quickly as I could while the three in the Jeep followed. They left Saoirse behind but the Mini was still there for her to use. Karolina told me before that they don’t stop hunting any kid they see until they’ve killed and eaten them the plan was to use the Audi’s speed to my advantage, get a good distance from them and then hide. The road was icy though so I still had to be extremely careful. Even without the help of another vehicle, it’d be easy to soun out when going too fast.

II drove and drove and drove as fast as I safely could until the Jeep was nowhere to be seen in my rear view mirror. I then drive up some smaller roads for a few miles in hopes they wouldn’t think to drive up them

“Why did you come back?” I asked Karolina while driving at a normal speed now

“You silly boy, I never left you”

“What do you mean?”

“I needed you to learn to survive by yourself if something was to happen to me. It was just another one of my lessons. I kept a close eye on you the whole time, only intervening when I knew you were truly unsafe. I realise it was very cruel of me”

“Oh. Did you mean what you said in the car that time?”

“No, and I am really sorry. I took it too far. Can you forgive me?”

I pulled over and sat in silence for a few moments. I then wrapped my arms around her and squeezed her tight and started crying

“I missed you. I missed you. I-I thought you hated me. I was so scared. Then they came along and-and I thought I was dead. And that poor little boy”

“Shhh shhh shhh shhh shhh” she kissed me on my head. “I am sorry, so so sorry. You did very good. I am so proud of you. You are so strong and I really missed you too. I also feared you would never want to speak to me again. I’m sorry. You are my family now and I love you”

“Just, please don’t do that again. Please”

“I promise I will not. I swear I will not”

We hugged and cried together for a good 10 minutes.

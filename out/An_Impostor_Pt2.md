(In case u didnt read part 1, read it so the story makes sens)




This is it, im tired of this bastard he striked again broke 2 windows on the cabine and brought in "the deer". Im going nuts. 


I spoke whit Mark and Frank and suggested them to go and act like we are catching a rabbit and i whoud send him to get more wood while we discuss what are we doing whit him.


Around 6 pm i told boys "We shoud try catching a rabit" and everyone agreed. We took sniper and revolver and went into the woods and then i saw it again, IT WAS THAT GOD DAMM DEER AGAIN, he was watching us from distance, i continued acting normal and as i saw nothing.


After some time we catched a rabit and brought it bsck home, again same thing i speak whit boys and ask Johhny to go get some wood for fire.


As he went away i slowly looked at him and when i coudnt see him i called Mark and Frank and spoke to them and told them my idea (to set up a trap will knockout fake Johhny and we will tie him and interegate him.


I sent guys to get a bucket (there is a basment like room in the cabine in wich are things that are used for cleaning and etc. and there was a big metal bucket we took.)


They filled a bucket whit rocks and it was ready, we set up trap in that basment-like room (we slightly opened a door and put bucket on top)


As me and boys were speaking how will we tie him we heard Johhny yelling "GUYS GUYS I HAVE A SUPRISE". As we turned we saw him carying buch of branches and Franks dog (Rotwiler) appeard behinde him but that wasnt that puppy we remembered it was sighltly off (like Johhnys doppelganger when he came in first time). 


I hit a Frank to act whit character so we arent suspicious.
He ran towards dog and huged it so it thinks it has our trust.


We ate and i told Frank that i need him to help me whit putting barriers on windows that are broken. We went in and Mark went whit us and Johnny said "I will stay here little bit more and finish off the rabit.".


As we put planks on windows we spoke and i told Frank to kick the dog out for "Misbehaving" so we can get Johnny to speak.


And it was like that we went inside and Frank got some lame reason to get Rotwiler out and we got him out. 


I asked Johhny to go to "basment" and get me a bucket so i can pick up all shards of glass, he opened a door and then he got a full bucket of stones crushed on his head knocking him tf out.


We tied him and placed Mark (the sniper guy) in corner on 2nd floor (it is like balcony) in dead angle in wich he is nearly impossible to be seen and you can see nearly entire living room from there.


As Johnny woke up i idndicated Mark to be ready to shoot him in head in case if he tryes to attack us. 

When he woke up he was pissed off, he was yelling cussing and saying that we are crazy. I slaped him and he was like "TF R U MENTAL U IDIOT?", as we spoke i noticed him looking behinde me and Frank.


I turned and saw scaryest shit ever it was Franks dog standing on top of something litteraly staring right down our souls and he had scaryest grin ever (from ear to ear).


As i started acting scared not 1 not 2 but rather 5 of them more appeard exactly same whit same grin and same eyes. As i idndicated Mark to look power went out and i hesrd chair and glass breaking.


I turned on my flashlight and got my revolver and just hear Mark yelling "I SHOT 2 OF THEM RUN RUN RUN". 


I fired few bullets in Johnny and went upstairs into Franks and Johnnys room. We are locked ourselfs in and just waited for someone to try enter (we set up both flashlights to shine in door, hid Mark under bed whit full mag of bulets and i had full mag of revolver in one corner and Frank hid in other corner whit an axe.


We were waiting like this for few hours and we didnt sleep.


As we seen sun coming out we slowly made our way and saw that entire cab was wrecked (everything was broken and torn into pieces) even Marks dog (Rex) was lost. He was devasted and suggested us killing all of them. 


I said it was a bad idea and that it isnt smart for us too fight them (trying to kill those creatures in self defence is okay but activly hunting them is suicidal mission) but he said it was worth a try and i said "ok we have to survive one more night anyways".


We spent entire day scraping everyting we coud and made pefect setup to get them killed (we made few barriers thru to get to the 2nd floor and then 2nd floor is full of barriers and traps (those spikey plants) and we had little cubby next to the window that leads towars higway (higway is around 5 or 6 km away)


We scraped few flares (6 reds 3 blue ones and one white). We did color code (red is to distract them white one will go off around 4am, if timer is made correctly, and ur supposte to lit blue flare in the morning if u survived in case if we separate).


We even got on some gloves and made rope on wich we can slide on to run away.


This is possible my last time writing u, if u see part 3 expect i ran away from them.


I still think this is stupid idea but they say "We are already ready and fully armed i think we will be fine"


Sorry for not writing more but i have to leave my phone in my pocket and on mute so they dont figure out our position.




Wish us luck

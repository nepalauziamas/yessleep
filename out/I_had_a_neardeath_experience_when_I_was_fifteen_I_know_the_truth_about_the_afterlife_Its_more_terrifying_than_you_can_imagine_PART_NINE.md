*"RUN!*" Aaron shouted at me and Dante, *"STAY AS CLOSE TOGETHER AS YOU CAN AND RUN! RUN AS FAST AS YOU FUCKING CAN! DON'T SLOW DOWN FOR NOTHING!"*

And so we did. Once again we ran, not just for our lives this time but also for our very souls. We ran as if all of Hell's demons were chasing us, and perhaps they were.

Aaron led the way, relying on his memory to navigate the sewer system because there was no time to stop and consult his map. A left here, a right there, me and Dante racing behind him. I could only hope he was going the right way. If we got lost down here before the lantern gave out...

The lantern in my hand was flicking more rapidly as the batteries weakened. I don't know how much longer it would last. Any second I expected it to go out, plunging us into total darkness.

Then I would see those red eyes all around me, would feel the Shadow Lurkers surrounding me, closing in--

*"This way!"* Aaron yelled, pointing down a junction in the sewer tunnel, *"This is it! Less than a mile! We can make it!"*

We turned into a narrow tunnel I remembered from when we had first set out earlier that day.

Dante was behind me. I could hear him panting with exertion as he struggled to keep up.

Several hundred yards later, I saw it materializing directly ahead of us. The ladder to the police station parking garage.

Salvation.

*"We're almost there!"* Aaron screamed.

Behind me, I heard Dante cry out in alarm.

I spun around.

I could dimly see Dante, in shadow,  lying face-first on the filthy sewer floor. He had slipped or trip over something. He sat up and began to get to his feet.

He had fallen just beyond the reach of the lantern's light.

I started forward, to bring him back into the circle of safety, but it was already too late.

The darkness around him came to life, hundreds of black hands seizing him with the speed of a rattlesnake striking. I could see the lantern's light glinting in Dante's terrified eyes. A glimpse that lasted only a second. The next he was gone. There was nothing there, not a single sign that he had ever been there. He never even had time to scream.

I stood there, looking on in numb shock.

Aaron, standing just behind me, had also witnessed Dante's end.

"He's gone," he said to me, "There's nothing we can do. Come on, we have to keep going!"

We ran to the ladder.

Aaron scrambled up it and began to pound on the underside of the manhole cover. *"Clark!"* he screamed in desperation, *"Clark, it's us! Open up! Hurry, for God's sake, there's not much time!"*

I put the lantern's handle between my teeth and climbed up after Aaron. I could faintly hear a scraping sound as Clark moved aside the wheel-barrel weighted down with cinderblocks. Then the manhole cover was lifted and Clark's kerosene lantern bathed me and Aaron in its protective glow.

Aaron climbed out of the sewer. I was right behind him. As I got to my feet, the battery-powered lantern gripped in my mouth flickered a final time, dimmed...then died. I threw the dead lantern down into the sewer.

Clark looked at me and Aaron, wide-eyed and relieved.

"Jesus, thank God you're back! You guys were gone so long Nadine and me were starting to think..."

He trailed off. He regarded me and Aaron, then looked expectantly at the manhole leading down into the sewer. He looked for several seconds, then looked back to Aaron, his expression becoming somber with realization.

"Dante? Jeff?"

Aaron didn't answer him. Neither did I. We didn't need to. Our expressions said it all.

Clark lowered his head and his shoulders sagged with understanding. "God," he whispered.

"Close the fucking manhole, Clark, then let's get back upstairs," Aaron told him.

Clark pushed the manhole cover back in place and replaced the wheel-barrel.

\*\*\*\*\*

Nadine was sitting on her cot with her legs drawn up, knees under her chin, staring into space, her face drawn and anxious, as Aaron and I entered the Police Chief's office. She looked at us and reacted, first startled, then relieved. She sprung to her feet.

"You made it!" she said, sounding happy for the first time since I had met her.

"*Two* of us made it," Aaron corrected her bleakly as he sat down on his cot. Clark entered behind us and shut the door.

Nadine's happy expression collapsed in an instant and her morose demeanor returned as it sank in. She was silent for several long moments. "Dante and Jeff...?"

"Gone," Aaron told her flatly.

She lowered her head into her hands.

"What about supplies," Clark asked Aaron anxiously, "how did you guys make out?"

At this, Aaron emitted a shrill, protracted sound that could have been either a wail of despair or the stark, humorless laugh of someone at the very edge of reason.

He removed his backpack and dumped out what was left in it, all we had to show for our expedition.

A single box containing ten emergency candles.

That was all. Ten candles. That was what Jeff and Dante had sacrificed their lives for and what Aaron and I had risked our own over: *ten fucking candles.* Ten candles that might offer us protection from the Shadow Lurkers for three days and surely no more than four...and that was if we were lucky. Ten six-inch sticks of wax; that's what Jeff and Dante's lives had been worth.

It had all been for nothing. I had lost my share of the supplies when my backpack had been snatched from me in the Walmart parking lot. All the extra supplies in the wheel-barrel had been lost with Jeff. And all the stuff in Dante's backpack had been taken with him by the Lurkers. The entire trip had been for nothing and had cost the lives of two of our group.

"What happened?" Nadine demanded, staring coldly at me and Aaron. "Tell us what happened. I want to hear everything."

We took turns telling her and Clark everything that had happened after we had left the police station that morning. When we finished there was a long moment of silence. Nadine stood up and walked to one of the barred windows. She stood there, looking out at the blackness.

"How much ammo do we have left?" Clark asked.

It didn't take long to find out. The three of us, me, Aaron and Clark, stood around the Police Chief's desk, looking down at our nearly exhausted supply. Seven twelve-gauge rounds. Eleven 45 ACP's. Eighteen nine-millimeters.

"That pretty much says it all, doesn't it?" Clark said quietly.

"There's not enough left to try for another supply run," Aaron said in a tone of utter hopelessness. "We'd be dead for sure if we tried."

Nadine, still standing at the window with her back to us, said in a hollow voice: "We're already dead." She slowly turned to face us. Her cheeks were streaked with tears. "We should just use those guns on ourselves and get it over with. It's better than waiting for the candles to run out or those things outside to get smart enough to find a way in here."

"There's gotta still be useful stuff here in town. Stuff close by we can--" Aaron began.

*"NO!"* she thundered at him, her eyes blazing with rage. She was more furious than I had ever seen her. "Even if by some miracle you found a stockpile of candles and batteries, then what, Aaron? *Then what?* How long do you want to keep living like this -- if you can even *call* it living! Hiding here in this fucking prison, those monsters surrounding us, trapped in a dead, empty world, no hope of ever seeing our families or feeling the sun or eating food or being safe ever again? Is this what you want to risk your lives to keep fighting for? To survive one day in hell just to find yourself in the next? And the next? And the next? Meeting new people, getting to know them, only for them to end up dying? Never knowing if you're going to be next? I've been enduring this nightmare for *eight fucking years,* Aaron! And that's probably a record! You've only been here two! You think you know about survival, that you're some seasoned pro, well fuck you! You don't know the first thing about surviving! You don't even know some of the horrible things I've seen here! I had a boyfriend at one point! Someone I met who for once in my life wasn't a complete piece of shit! Someone I loved! You know what happened to him? We were being chased by those goddamn corpses and he ran off to draw them away so I had a chance of escaping. They tore him into pieces while I ran to save myself like a coward. I can still hear him screaming in my mind. You know how many people I've seen get killed? I saw a baby, a newborn baby, helpless, completely defenseless, and....and they..." She slumped against the wall, collapsing, and started to sob.

The three of us just looked at her, taken aback by her outburst, not knowing what to say.

She wiped away her tears and fixed us with a stony expression. "Dante and Jeff are lucky. They found the only real escape."

Clark, Aaron and me looked at each other. And I could see in their eyes they were both thinking exactly what I was: Nadine was right.

We would be better off dead. Even if what came after death was some hell even worse than this wretched half-state of existence, this living damnation.

Clark suddenly groaned. He staggered back, putting a hand to his head.

"Clark?" Aaron asked him, concerned.

"I don't feel..." Clark began, sounding dazed.

And then he collapsed, writhing in excruciating pain.

"Clark!" Aaron screamed, and knelt by his side.

*"Oh God, my head, it hurts so fucking baaaaad!*" Clark wailed, his eyes squeezed shut in agony, his teeth bared. As I watched, all the color, the vitality, the life, seemed to faded from his skin, living it waxy and pale.

*"What is it, what's wrong?"* Aaron screamed at him.

*"I'm dying!"* Clark howled. *"I'm dying right now!"* He opened his eyes, looking at Aaron beseechingly. "Please," he gasped through gritted teeth, imploring desperately, "please Aaron, kill me now. Shoot me before I die. I don't want to turn like Lauren. I don't want to be one of them, even for a second."

Aaron stood and grabbed one of the pistols from the desk. He quickly loaded a single round.

"Alright, Clark," he said solemnly and chambered the round. He knelt and placed the barrel between Clark's eyes. He pulled the trigger.

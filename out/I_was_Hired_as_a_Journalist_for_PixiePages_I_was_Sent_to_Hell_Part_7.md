Author's note: Part 6 has some horror but is more of a cute part. If you would like context for why Josh is sent to hell, part 6 is linked. Thank you for reading :)

Long time no see folks, I went to hell. Spoiler alert, guess who's back from hell?

I sat quietly in the back corner, eyeing each guest carefully. I'd learned the telltale signs of heeled folks, and let me tell you, things were not promising.

I counted at least thirteen men packing heat, yet not a single bit of cabbage.

Sighing, I ushered the scrawny waiter to my table. "Kid, take this," I tucked a wad of dough in his front pocket, then continued. "Head home, everyone here is aboutta croak." I slid a finger across my throat, staring straight ahead the whole while.

"Sa-sir?" The young kid stumbled, gulping when I flashed my piece.

"Thirty seconds, pal. Best be on your way." I pat his shoulder twice, as reassuring as I could be. I turned away, gulping in turn.

Just as the kid rounded the corner, disappearing into the kitchen, traffic outside exploded with horns and shouting.

The shouting quickly vanished as Tommy's sang their lethal song. I hit the deck the moment the first horn blared, though no one else followed suit.

Covering my ears and clenching my eyes tight, the muffled spitfire riddled the restaurant. Warm blood and half eaten meals splattered the area, coating my flogger in a ghastly mess.

I crawled beneath my table in calculated strides, biting my tongue as lead pierced my left calf.

A minute of pumping lead later, and the glorified speakeasy fell silent. Save for the drip drip from assorted drinks and dying breaths from the poor schmucks laying in their own blood, the world was almost peaceful.

"Oww-ewww!" The pompous prick howled.

I crept my way to the kitchen, keeping low. I did not need that wannabe wolf indulging in my flesh. I had to time this right.

"Wha-you?" The same boy sobbed, barely worse for wear.

"Sha" I shushed him, covering his mouth. "Something a lot worse than some petty button man is about to-"

SLAM! The bulky beast crashed through the barely intact glass, causing the building to rumble.

I clenched my eyes tight, forcing myself to maintain my breathing in the face of the monster.

Three… two… one… I counted in my head, holding up a glass shard as a mirror to peak around the corner.

The feral fur ball raked up its foul feast, using its claws to leave not but a single drop of blood. It then proceeded to shovel the gruesome gourmet into its gullet, not a care in the word.

A painfully sharp gasp escaped the kid's mouth… shit!

The werewolf was upon us within a heartbeat, pouncing for the poor youth with all eight razor-sharp claws.

"Shit!" I spat, firing off three rounds in quick succession.

Icy ichor painted the kitchen, freezing my exposed skin. I took caution protecting my open leg wound from contamination, simultaneously drawing my dagger.

I limped towards the werewolf and began carving through its thick hide. Quiet grunts escaped it, before quickly fading as its heart was severed from the veins.

Killing one of these was no small task, but I damn sure kept to the rules.

I pried the young lad out from beneath the werewolf, slapping him out of his shock. "Can you walk, boy?" I pressed, short on patience.

The boy said nothing, floundering incoherent, silent words that he simply could not voice.

Fifteen minutes or so later, my men *finally* showed up. All I did was point to the remains, nod at the kid, and they got to work. Half an hour later, the once romantic setting lay as a pile of ashes.

"Devil, buttons are a few blocks out. We gotta get going while the going's good." Joey advised, wide eyed.

"Very well, let's blow this place." I sighed, loading into the back of a Model 18. The dark tinted glass blotted out the outside world, leaving me alone with my thoughts. 

That peace was quickly broken by the sniffling teen sat beside me. "Wha-what's going to happen to me?" He whined, trembling. He seemed more frightened of me than the werewolf.

"That is entirely up to you, son. I am just your average, every day Big Shot. Though you haven't heard of us, we make sure of no," I made air quotes "loose ends."

The kid tried to gulp, instead he began to dry heave. *Great, now he's in a panic attack* I rolled my eyes.

"Look, we'll take care a' ya. Don't sweat it kid, you're safe." I comforted him, though it did little to quell his anxiety. What came next added even more to that sinking ship.

BANG! Something collided with us, sending our car screeching and spinning out.

Hulking fists smashed into the windshield, over and over until finally breaching it. The muscular hands grabbed hold of my chauffeur, plucking him from the front seat.

I whipped my piece to my window, shattered it with Azy's finger, and fired off at the horned humanoid. The minotaur fell forwards, crushing my driver along with the front of my car. *So much for the car.*

I dragged the kid out behind me, popping an airborne assailant with a well placed shot. The winged creature crashed into the asphalt with a solid SLAM!

That little shit! I never saw it coming.

Razors dug into my shoulder, tearing a chunk free. I bit down hard to stop from falling unconscious as rows upon rows of teeth sawed deeper in on a second assault.

The shark mouthed bastard began to chuckle, his sobs turning to prideful, boastful snickers.

A chill trickled down my back, along with a good pint of blood.

*Click! Click!* empty, shit!

"Poor little Joshie, sent to hell and still showing compassion. When will you learn-?!" The shark kid likely would have continued their monolog, had I not shot my trump card through his chest.

"I'm the Devil Finger, asshole!" I spat, choking on blood. "Fuck you, your mom, and your shark dad, scale shit!" I panted, doing all I could to stay upright.

It wasn't safe here. The Forked Tongues were trying to cut off the head of the Devil Fingers. They were after my head.

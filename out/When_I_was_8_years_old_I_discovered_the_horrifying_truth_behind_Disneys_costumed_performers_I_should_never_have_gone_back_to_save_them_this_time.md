In hindsight, I was fucking stupid to think any of this would end with a happy ending—to actually think I could fulfil that promise I made 10 years ago. 

The promise I made to Princess Rapunzel and Flynn Rider that I would get them out of there.

I was wrong.

And now I’m going to die.

[How can I even get a signal down here?](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/w68ull/when_i_was_8_years_old_i_was_kidnapped_by/) 

I’m back with an update. Please note that my first post was written on my laptop at home where I felt safe and secure. Right now, I can’t say the same. 

I’m writing this on my phone on 85% battery. I hope there’s enough connection to get this out into the world. It’s so cold down here I can barely type, but that’s all I can do right now. I need to tell you what’s going on. And hopefully you can help me.

After making my post last week, I drove myself crazy worrying over whether it would be taken down by Disney themselves, or I’d end up dead in a ditch.

I’m on Summer vacation right now, so I’ve spent most of my days in my room trying and failing to sleep and monitoring my post to see if anyone else has had a similar experience or a loved one missing at the park. But things seemed fairly quiet. I can’t say I let my guard down, but I did start to relax a little more. The whole point of making the post was to get this off my chest—ten years of frustration and anger that I’d failed to save two kids who never grew up. 

I saw it myself last week.

I saw the horrifying reality behind being a Disney park performer. That’s not something you can keep to yourself. I’ve been told my entire life that what I saw as a kid was just my rampant imagination.

Therapists told me I had to let it go—that I’d had a bad experience at Disney, and I couldn’t let it define my life.

Well, they were just adults who refused to entertain the idea of what I was saying being true. 

They only knew facts and logic and none of what I was saying fit any of those categories. 

One of those adults was of course my mom, who found out I’d been back to the park after being “officially uninvited” and had grounded me for a week. As long as I was living under her roof, the rules which have crippled me my whole life still applied.  There was no point trying to explain what happened. 

I knew it would be like screaming at a brick wall, and just wasting energy when I could use that to figure out how the fuck I was getting back in there without getting potentially arrested. 

It was clear to me that the park saw me as a threat and was willing to shut my mouth whatever it took. 

The first step was making sure I didn’t set foot in there—God only knew what the second would be. On Sunday night, I received a phone call at around 8pm.

I can’t remember what I was doing. Every day since going back to Fantasyland had been a blur of nothing—a colourless wave of time slipping by and nothing else. I couldn’t stop thinking about Flynn Rider – or Roman—the boy who had been physically turned into a Disney prince against his will.

He followed me to the gate.  Mindless animatronic drones aren’t supposed to do that, right?

That’s what I had seen a week ago.

What happened to Snow White.

Flynn showed me what he and Rapunzel were being turned into 10 years ago—their skin turned to metal; their humanity being drained away by a strange device connected to their ear. 

And surely what I had seen a week ago had been the finished product. 

So, why had he followed me? With the question haunting the back of my mind, my brain clouded with cotton candy thoughts, I grabbed my phone and tapped ANSWER on an unknown number. 

I didn’t realise it was unknown until I took a second look at the screen. For a moment I considered putting the phone down, but a nagging feeling kept me holding on. 

“Who is this?”

“You’re a coward.” The voice on the other end of the line rattled with static, and something slimy squirmed its way up my throat. It was a guy, maybe two or three years younger than me, “I’ve been waiting for you to go back,” He hissed out.

“I’ve been waiting for some kind of update, but there is none. You’ve given up on them, haven’t you? Because you’re a coward.”

“I…” I couldn’t speak.

What was I supposed to say?

“You’re what?” He scoffed.  “Sorry? If you were sorry, you would have gone back. You wouldn’t just leave them.”

Suddenly it was so hard to swallow, to breathe in and out. “How did you get this number?”

He’d seen my post. I don’t know how the hell he’d gotten my number, but this guy had read my post.

The kid ignored me, continuing to spit poison down the phone. “We both know that if you hadn’t had attracted attention to yourself the second time you got in there, you could have gotten past the guard and done exactly what you should have done ten years ago,” he let out a sharp hiss,  "But you didn’t, did you? You freaked out and left them to fucking rot. Again.”

It was the emphasis on the last word which made me put the phone down. 

Anger I couldn’t even comprehend, a cocktail of desperation and pain and frustration which felt eerily familiar to my own. I expected the guy to ring again, but he didn’t—and I wondered what his connection to my post was. Was he a faceless reader desperate for an update, or someone closer?

Either way, I knew I had to get back in. I’d gone in solo initially, so this time I’d blend in with more people to avoid getting caught. I have a restraining order, so the police could get involved if I got caught again. But when I relayed that thought in my head, that’s exactly what I wanted.

I wanted the police to be alerted. So, I could finally bring what Disney is doing to people to light. 

As long as I got into that room and lead the police to the bodies, the machine, and all the other fucked up shit going on, I’d be able to save them. 

So, I started planning. I got another fake ID, went over the map of the park multiple times, and noted down every detail. Next, I had to find others to go with—which was easy. I have four close friends, one of which is my neighbour. 

When I suggested the idea to a group of my friends from school on our group chat, I got a mixed response.  Most of them were happy to go, excited to spend their last summer drowning in the nostalgia of their childhood. Others, however, were sceptical.

I didn’t know there were so many horror stories surrounding Disney. Ghosts, missing families, and mysterious deaths. 

Zach, who lives next door and my friend since we were in diapers, sent me multiple articles detailing child disappearances dating all the way back to the 60’s. 

I asked him if it was the same for young adults, but no—it was just kids. Which couldn’t be right. 

The bodies I saw when I was eight were all teenagers—all of them missing limbs and heads, painted in the deepest shade of red I’d ever seen. I know as a kid your perception of the world can be different, but I know what I saw. As I read through seemingly endless lists of disappearances in and around the park, however, there was no mention of the names I was looking for. 

There were no Maya’s or Roman’s. No accounts on the hysterical eight-year-old girl who was thrown out of the park in 2011, which I knew must have gained at least some traction online through the years.

The internet loves its conspiracy theories according to Zach, and I should have been there somewhere. But there was nothing, and I was getting progressively more frustrated. It’s like anything which could have been real, which could have actually happened—real people going missing and dying—had been drowned out by paranormal stories featured in Buzzfeed articles and top 10 videos.

It made me wonder. Were these stories fabricated by the park themselves? 

To suffocate the real stories bubbling to the surface, where the name Roman might have popped up on a google search, or Maya. They had second names, identities I didn’t know, families still waiting for them to come home. Knowing that there were no traces of them, or that they had been wiped away intentionally, it only made me more desperate to go back. 

I knew exactly what I had to do. I’d written the instructions in notepads, doodled them on anything which could be written on throughout the years—desks, school textbooks, my own arms. I’d  turned them into a mantra to stop brewing panic attacks. First tunnel. Rabbit hole. Fairy dust. Big red button. The only things in the way were the fucking guards and the possibility of being recognised.

This time they knew what I looked like, so I cut my hair and dyed it the dullest color I could find. I knew it wouldn’t completely change my identity, but it would help me blend in with the crowd. Zach noticed. 

He didn’t say anything, but I caught his awkward glances during the car-ride. I kept my head down while the others sang to pop songs and exchanged memories from our four years at Westbrook High. 

At one point Zach leaned over and showed me his phone, which was a news article on Disney Disasters. Zach is the type of guy who would rather watch a serial killer documentary than go to prom. In fact, that’s what he did in junior year. 

He’s fascinated with all things paranormal and mysterious, and there was nothing like potential horror at the most magical place on earth to get his synapses tingling. “Look at this.” He stabbed at the screen; his eyes ignited with excitement. “Look! It says here in 1992, thirty people were poisoned on the Pirates of the Caribbean ride.”

Before I could answer, he was cutting me off again.

“Oh! And apparently someone was beheaded on, "It's a Small World'' in the 80’s due to some kind of malfunction with the ride.” Zach frowned at his phone, “I think this one is more of an urban legend, because there’s not really much about it.”

That caught my attention.

“Is there anything else about It’s a Small World?” I asked, my stomach galloping into my throat.

Zach’s gaze snapped back to his phone. “Not that I know of. I mean, there’s nothing here and I’ve been scrolling for ages.”

I swallowed, thinking back to the phone-call I got on Sunday night. “What about performers?”

“What, like the people in costumes?”

My chest tightened, and I struggled to relocate the words in my head.

First tunnel. Rabbit hole. Fairy dust. Big red button.

“Yeah.” I said, “Has anyone reported anything… weird about them?”

“Weird?” Zach frowned. “There was something about some performers pouring hot soup on ride goers as a prank, but that’s it. The kids were fired, and there was an apology made to the people who got covered in soup. Which is actually hilarious.”

“So, there’s nothing about It’s a Small World?” I pressed.

“Nope.” Zach pulled off his beanie, swiping his clammy forehead with the back of his hand. As usual he was a mess, but somehow that “mess” was also marginally attractive. Tommy, our designated driver, and last edition to our group, a British exchange student who was almost the complete opposite of him had been stealing glances at the guy all morning. “I told you last night, there’s nothing. Just ghost shit.” He shrugged. 

“There are rumours of maybe the odd teenager going missing, but they’re just that. Rumours. And besides, what about the countless ghost sightings? They’re definitely the souls of the dead children.” 

Zach used his phone as a flashlight and held it under his chin. It didn’t create the effect he wanted when we were in broad daylight, and it wasn’t even noon. 

Still, he tried. He deepened his voice. Zach was in the drama club since freshman year and admittedly his spooky voice was pretty good. “Have you guys ever heard of the haunting death of—"

“No, Zach.” Key, who had been car-sick for most of the trip, lifted her head from her knees. “No, we don’t need to know about badly written Urban legends. Because if you keep talking about people being beheaded, I’m going to behead you.”

“Ouch.” Tommy shot Zach a grin. “She’s gunning for you, mate.” His gaze flickered to me before he turned back to the road.

“You don’t strike me as the conspiracy theory type, Emma.”  Tommy leaned forward and cranked the radio up.

I considered telling them everything, but that would mean taking them with me and I didn’t want them to get hurt.

“I was just curious.” I said.

Zach, however, didn’t seem convinced. He went back to his phone, but every so often I’d catch his worried gaze.

When we arrived at the park, I was dizzy with nerves. I put my head down and avoided eye contact when we went through the gate. As soon as the four of us were walking down the strip, however, I got brave again—just like when I was eight. But this time the sweet aroma in the air turned my gut, and my gaze latched into every Disney performer who walked past with bright smiles.

Key, who was still recovering from her barfing episode, ran off to stalk some of the Frozen performers, and Tommy reluctantly went after her. I used that opportunity to head to Fantasyland quickly, so I could get it over with. My mind was awash with hurricane thoughts as I pushed my way through the crowd heading to It’s a Small World, which was open to my relief.  

I joined the queue waiting and took a moment to think through everything. I had to get to the first tunnel and jump off the ride, then find the rabbit hole, and get down to what I’d pegged The Scarlet Room. 

Where the metal monster lay in wait, chewing and spitting out bodies and creating performers through twitching human shells, drained of their humanity—everything they were. It’s weird. Everything around me seemed so happy, so joyful, and colourful with little kids laughing, oblivious of what was underneath our feet, Disney classics blasting through overhead speakers, and the scents of cotton candy and popcorn being pumped into my nose. 

And yet I was about to go back to the hell I’d seen when I was 8.

I was watching Snow White hand out candy apples to little kids crowding around her, and I felt sick. I couldn’t look at her without remembering her twitching movements on the conveyor belt coming out of the metal monster’s mouth; her wide grin splitting open her lips—the screams which had been so human, so horrific, sending my little self to my knees and slamming my hands over my ears—before they twisted into melodic singing.

I can’t write exactly how I felt at that moment.

I keep trying but it’s hard to put that kind of despair into words.

Seeing her, this girl with no identity who had been turned into Snow White, who had been this character for ten whole years, and was still there, still trapped, because I couldn’t do one simple thing. It wasn’t long before my body started to react to my racing brain, thoughts that wouldn’t shut the fuck up. My palms grew sweaty, my breath caught in my throat. 

The closer I was getting to the ride; I was feeling sicker and sicker.  

Do you know that feeling when you can’t breathe? Air makes sense, and you know you’re breathing it, but somehow your brain had convinced you you’re not? That’s what I felt like. I felt like the world was ending around me, my vision feathering.

I was sure I was going to throw up all over the guy in front of me when someone grabbed my shoulder. I twisted around, expecting to see a guard coming to kick me out, but it was just Zach with his usual smile. “Aren’t you a little old for It’s a Small World?” His gaze went to the roof, “Also, this ride is really creepy.”

The knots in my gut loosened slightly. “Are you scared?”

“What? No!” Zach blew a raspberry. “I just want to know why your first destination is kid central.”

“Nostalgia.” I replied, watching little kids jump onto the ride.

It looked exactly the same as ten years ago, with added refurbishments. The animatronic dolls were a lot brighter with a fresh coat of paint, moving more naturally instead of swaying to that haunting song. I noticed the whole set was different, and when I looked into the water it was a lot deeper than I remembered.  “Huh.” Zach shrugged. He gave me a playful nudge. “Hey, I’m not judging you for wanting to be a kid again. It’s kind of adorable.”

He had no idea how much I wanted the exact opposite.

“And why exactly are you here?” I asked, when the two of us jumped aboard. To my surprise, we weren’t the only ones above the age of five. Another teenage boy, around fifteen or sixteen, sat in front. 

I grabbed a seat at the back just like I did as a kid, and Zach slumped down next to me. “I have my reasons.” He said while I watched two guards jump on at the front. As long as they didn’t turn around and focused on the little kids, I could step off the ride when we reached the first tunnel.

Zach’s answer didn’t really hit me until we started moving, and I lifted my head, my gaze snapping from the water to the first wall of dolls which came to life as we slowly glided past. The kids sitting ahead watched in awe—and admittedly it was less creepy than last time. The dolls were a lot more lifelike. 

Zach was filming the attractions on his phone as I got ready to jump up. 

When the ride was enveloped in darkness from the first tunnel, only just lit up with ghostly white light, there was  sudden movement in front of me. 

The younger boy who boarded with us stood up, swiftly planting one foot on the side of the ride, and leapt onto the narrow ledge. 

There was a moment when I thought he was going to fall, his arms windmilling as he dived across the stark narrow gap, but the kid righted himself and hurriedly ducked behind a grinning doll twitching back and forth. Zack’s attention left his phone for a moment. “Woah. What’s he doing?”

“No idea.” I said breathlessly, pulling apart my belt.

Zach grabbed my arm. “Wait, what are you doing?” His tone rose in panic. “Are you seriously following him?”

I jumped up, throwing my arms out for balance. “When you get off this ride, I want you guys to get out of here.”

“Why?”

“Just trust me.”

“What?” Zach twisted in his seat, “Emma, you can’t just… you can’t just jump off a ride!”

Ignoring him, I followed the boy’s movements. Now that I was an adult, it was harder to stay on my feet. Throwing my arms out to keep my balance, I stumbled to the edge of the boat and jumped onto the side with one leg and using the rest of my body to catapult myself onto the ledge. 

When I turned to face my friend, I caught fear in his eyes as the boat bled into the next tunnel. 

Zach didn’t say anything. He didn’t start shouting or trying to get an orderlies attention. He just stared with wide eyes and twisted lips. I could only give him a half-hearted smile which promised I’d explain everything when I saw him again.

My brain was quick to remind me of the fears which had been drowning my subconscious since coming to the park for the second time. What if I never saw him again? What if my name became obsolete too? Just another number, a statistic in disappearances on some internet forum.

I couldn’t think like that. Not when I was so close. Focusing on the now, I followed the shadow of the boy who jumped off before me. His movements were erratic; I watched him drop to his knees, clawing around for something, his hands grasping at the ground. I sensed his desperation and was reminded of my eight-year-old self. How much I wanted to save Flynn and Rapunzel. 

Something warm crawled up my throat when I realised what I was doing. Slowly, I made my way over to him, dodging a security camera hidden in the corner of the cave. “You’re looking for the rabbit hole, aren’t you?” I said, keeping my voice down. I remembered it being hidden in the dark. I found it by accident. Ten years later, however, the rabbit hole was nowhere to be found. Almost like I’d imagined it.

It was almost funny. Like I’d tripped back into a reality where all of this was fiction, a stupid fantasy in my head.

Just like my mom said.

“Where is it?”

The boy turned to face me, though his face was shrouded in darkness. “You said it was here, so where is it?”

His voice was familiar minus interference and crackling.

I swallowed. “You called me.”

“And you’re Emma.” He spat. “You abandoned my brother. Twice.”

Brother.

Shattered jigsaw pieces were slowly sliding into place in my head.

Oh.

As I closed the distance between us, the eerie glow emitting from the wall of dolls illuminated his face and I got a glimpse of my past, my heart hurtling into my throat. 

There were certain attributes that definitely separated them, but the resemblance was uncanny.  

If I looked past the prosthetics and makeup, the crooked nose, and wide cartoonish eyes I had seen ten years ago, I imagined this was what the boy underneath the Disney Prince would have looked like. 

I could see him in freckles speckled on his cheeks, darker eyes which gave off an intimidating glare, and that same scowl. This was a much younger version of him, a version I hadn’t even stopped to think was real. Of course he had a family, but I had been ignorant to think after so many years they forgot about him; that he was just a cold case and they had moved on. I wondered if the permanent look of annoyance was a hereditary thing but seeing him felt… good. Like I was seeing Flynn again, the so-called fantasy.

“You could have saved him.” The boy’s voice was almost a plea. “You could have saved all of them, and you didn’t.”

I could only nod. “I know.” I whispered. “I tried.”

“You tried?” He rolled his eyes. It was crazy how much he was like his brother. “I had to scroll through over-descriptive bullshit to find that my brother has been turned into a mannequin or a five nights knock off, or whatever the fuck you said, but also that you left him. You abandoned him for ten years and knew exactly what was going on,” His voice splintered. 

“Did you not once think to maybe call the fucking cops? And I’m not even talking about ten years ago. You were a kid, sure. But I mean a week ago. You’re, what, eighteen, and you didn’t go to actual law enforcement who could have actually helped you?”

When his yell echoed, I grabbed and yanked him behind a life-size doll.

“You need to be quiet.” I said, “There are camera’s everywhere and if you keep yelling, we’re going to get caught.”

The boy resisted against my grasp, and then reluctantly nodded.

His words were still a hurricane in my head. Poison, sure, but the boy was right.

But who would believe a hysterical teenager over a multi-billion-dollar company?

When I was sure he was going to he quiet, I let him go and focused on finding the rabbit hole.

“It’s not here.” The boy said after maybe half a second of searching. He turned to me, hissing in frustration.

“It is. Just keep looking.” I said, but I wasn’t sure.

I was waiting for the ground to leave my feet, but nothing was happening.

“You said it was here!” The boy groaned. “You said it was at the first tunnel”

I could tell he had a short fuse. He was pacing back and forth, running his hand through his mess of hair. “Did you lie?” He spat. “Was that post to get attention? Because… because that’s what people do these days, right? They lie to go viral, to get those likes and comments… is that what you did…?” 

The kid trailed off, and he looked so helpless, glaring at the ground.

I saw anger, and desperation— longing. Even if he didn’t believe it. Even if he thought I’d made it all up— he still wanted to know for sure. He had still hope, and I admired that. The kid hadn’t given up on his brother, even after ten years.

“You’re kidding,” I kicked at the ground, scanning for the rabbit hole. “You really think I’d lie about all of this?”

“Kids do anything these days to go viral.” He folded his arms.

“Then why are you here?” I was slowly losing my patience. “You came here! You believed me!”

He shrugged. “I’ll believe anything to get closure.”

“My imagination isn’t that good.” Looking at the ceiling, I remembered cracks in the tunnel, but they were gone. The ground was a lot smoother. “It’s been refurbished.” I muttered. “Which means they built the new ride over the old one from 2011.”

And following that line of thinking, I turned my gaze to the walls. If my theory was correct, we were under the old ride. Though I wasn’t the only one thinking it. Roman’s brother wandered over to something, and when I squinted, I realised he was grasping metal prongs sticking out of rough brick. A ladder. 

He went up first and I joined him. 

Just as I thought, the ladder led to the old ride. 

But still—no sign of the rabbit hole. During my research I read that there were multiple tunnels underneath the park. Apparently, they were known to the public, used for performers to get to their designated workstations across the park. 

The old It’s a Small World ride had been left for the elements, the water drained. It didn’t take us long to figure out that the ladder had lead us to the second tunnel, and after wading in shallow dregs of what looked like sewage, we finally found it.

As an adult there was nothing spectacular about it. When I was a kid, it was a magical portal into The Scarlet Room.

Now it just looked like an abandoned construction accident. The two of us stood over the hole in silence.

“You read that I met your brother, right?” I spoke softly. “So, you know what happened to him.”

The boy didn’t look at me, his gaze on the oblivion underneath us. “You met him a week ago.”

“He looked right through me.” I whispered, cringing at the memory of Flynn’s robotic grin.

“No, I’m talking about at the gate. He actually spoke to you.” Roman’s brother lifted his head, his expression crumpled.

“That’s why you’re here.” He was searching my expression for a slither of hope. “You think he’s still in there.”

I didn’t know how to answer. He was right. I did think his brother was in there… somewhere.

“There’s something else.” The boy cleared his throat.

“What’s that?”

“The police. They’re not coming.” He laughed shakily. “Even if you do call them, they won’t come. Or they will and they’ll come up with some bullshit story.”

Before I could speak, he sighed. “Two weeks after my brother disappeared, two strangers came to our door with a deal mom and dad couldn’t refuse—and hey, they fucking hated him anyway, so why not sell him to an evil corporation?”

“They shut your parents up.” I said.

“Yep. We moved into a big house, dad got a new car, and I got whatever toys my mom thought would shut me up too.” The boy’s expression darkened.

“They sold my fucking brother.” He stabbed at the temple, emphasising every word. “They sold him for a better life— one where they got everything handed to them on a silver fucking platter, and they didn’t have to put up with him anymore.” He sighed. “According to my parents, my brother ‘ran away to a friend’s house and emancipated’.”

“They sold him.” I shivered. “To Disney.”

“I didn’t know it was Disney at the time, but yeah. I was just pissed because you got caught before you could help him.”

The boy sniffled and swiped at his eyes, but he didn’t cry.

“What’s your name?” I asked.

“Jasper.”

“You sure you want to do this, Jasper?”

He stubbornly folded his arms. “I was seven when he disappeared. I had no clue what was happening. Unlike those assholes, I still waited for him to come back, and it killed me when he didn’t. Ten fucking years, and I waited. He’d be an old man now.”

“At twenty-seven?”

He shot me a sickly smile. “Haven’t you heard? Anything close to thirty is ancient.”

“He’s definitely not an old man.”

The boy’s eyes darkened. “Whatever he is, I want to know if there’s anything left of him to take home.”

“Back to your aunt?”

His eyes softened. “Yeah. Even after a decade, she’s still in pieces. Aunt Lydia is all I have left.”

I nodded. “And what if you don’t like what we find?”

He pulled something out of his hoodie. A lighter. 

“Easy. I’ll torch the place.”

When I could only manage a hiss,  Jasper sighed. “Relax, I meant the room with the metal monster who ate Snow White.”

Jasper’s words were strangely comforting. This kid had taken in every word I’d written—every experience I’d struggled to get down with trembling hands. 

He believed it all and had hope for his brother. 

I remember wanting to talk to him or apologise, or something—something which would make up for abandoning Roman. But sudden footsteps and voices sent my body into panic, and I stumbled forwards and reached out, the force of my hands sending Jasper tumbling into the dark, gravity plunging me into that oh-so-familiar darkness which had haunted my nightmares since I was a little kid. 

Unlike the first time I wasn’t expecting fairy dust or the air to carry me. I expected exactly what I got; a fall which lasted maybe a few seconds before impact. This time I didn’t land on concrete, instead something soft with the sensation of bed clothes.

It took me a second to realise I’d made it.

Back to The Scarlet Room.

Which was exactly the way I’d left it. When I lifted my head, blinking back feathering vision, I was greeted by that same red light. The monster contraption towered over me, a lot bigger than I remembered. 

The metallic shark-like jaw resembled something from a Saw trap. 

The conveyor belt wasn’t visible, but I knew it was still there locked inside waiting for its next victim. The only thing which was different was the ground.

Instead of the floor I was lying in what I can only describe what felt like being suffocated in dead fish. Jasper’s cry sent me hurting up, and when I fully drank in what I was standing on, I should have known. I should have known that 10 years had passed, and that pile I’d seen as a kid would only get bigger. 

The two of us had landed in bodies entangled with each other, limbs and torso’s like broken doll pieces and missing heads blanketed in clothes stained ancient shades of red. And those were the ones at the top. I didn’t have to look far to see a skeletal mouth poking from another dismembered corpse. 

Jasper was hyperventilating when I found him. Not screaming or crying. Just staring into nothing. Shaking. His eyes wouldn’t find mine, only what we were standing on, his sharp breaths getting heavier.

“Jasper.” I grabbed his shoulders before he could freak out. “Hey, it’s okay. You’re okay. Breathe.”

“Breathe?” He spoke in pants. “He’s here.”

His gaze flitted back and forth drinking in the hell we had found ourselves in. “Is this where he’s been?” Jasper shrieked, “This… this is where he’s been all this time? Buried in… in this?” He dropped to his knees. “But he won’t be able to... to breathe! We need to get him out. He can’t breathe. Oh god, he’s been here. All this fucking time. Here. He’s been here.”

My attention went to the red button which was still there on the same panel of buttons and switches.

“Can you stay here for me?” I whispered. “Just stay here, and I’ll press the button, okay?”

He didn’t reply, clawing through bodies. He was looking for Roman, I realised.

I wanted to stay with him, but something told me if I stayed, I would only make things worse.

I don’t know how I managed to get off of the pile of bodies. I just staggered, looking for direction, my stomach trying to catapult into my throat as I stamped on heads and decomposing flesh. 

When my feet found the ground, I dragged my legs over to the panel. The button was right in front of me; what Flynn and Rapunzel had begged me to press ten years ago—and as I slammed my hand into it, I wondered what was going to happen. They didn’t tell me what pressing the button would do, only that I had to press it. 

I got the answer before I could suck in a breath. The ground rumbled beneath my feet, and I looked up to see if the monster was coming to life once again. 

But, no, it wasn’t the metal contraption which was moving. It was the ceiling. Jasper and I had come through what looked like a chute, and to my horror the ceiling, suddenly lined with tooth-like spikes, began to descend—and I understood with a sickening twist in my gut, exactly what Flynn and Rapunzel had meant.

They didn’t want to be saved, I thought dizzily, my gaze going to the ceiling, to the crushing spikes stained crimson.

And then the pile of bodies.

They wanted to be free.

And I was a week and ten years too late.

I shook my head of the thought.

No, that couldn’t be right.

I saw Rapunzel—Maya’s—arm. I felt patches of her skin. I hugged Flynn and he felt human!

And just how… how did they have so many bodies? Surely someone must have noticed!

“Emma!”

Jasper’s yell sent me hurtling towards the pile of bodies, but I was seeing something else, what looked like a door.

And Jasper’s shadow heading towards it.

He was waving his arms. “I’ve found a way out!!”

A way out? My brain felt like cotton candy.

Another look at the ceiling told me we had maybe a minute to get out of there.

Jasper had already slipped though a large metal door which had opened automatically.

It must have been triggered when the ceiling started descending.

When I followed him through the door, which slammed behind me, I found myself standing on white marble flooring. The place reminded me of a hospital ward. But I wasn’t alone. A youngish man in a suit had a tight hold of Jasper’s shoulders.

“Hello.” He nodded at me. “I was about to show your friend where his brother is. Would you like to come?”

I could only follow the two of them down winding hallways which blurred into one mass of disorienting white.

The man stopped at what looked like a storage closet and held open the door. “There you go.”

Jasper pulled away from the man and stumbled inside, and I was close behind. I was right, it was like a storage closet. But instead of clothes there were—people. Characters. I glimpsed Ariel, Snow White, Aladdin, The Frozen sisters and…

“He looks exactly the same.” Jasper’s voice was a whispered hiss. He started forwards, as if in a trance.

“Roman?” Jasper grabbed Flynn and shook him. But he was limp. “Hey!” His trembling hands grazed the boy’s face. “What did they do to you?” When the Prince didn’t move, Jasper grew hysterical, clawing at his face and the material of his costume.

“Roman! Hey, you spoke to her! I know you did! You said...you said it was a small world, right?”

He turned to me. “Roman said that! Didn’t he?”

The man cleared his throat.  “It is an old model, so we expect blips—including abnormal speech patterns.”

“Think of it like this.” The man said. “Imagine you went to sleep a long time ago, and suddenly you wake up inside a shell of steel made to entertain.” 

He clucked his tongue, “Kid, our performers aren’t supposed to have self-awareness. If they did, it would drive them crazy—and would you blame them? Years spent in relaxing slumber only to find their body has gone. Every self-aware moment in a body which has stopped will make you regret ever hoping to be set free. And why you want to escape?” 

His laugh sent shivers down my spine. “You are entertaining children, allowing them to bask in a fantasy of their own mind.”

The suited man’s lips curled. “So, young man. Would you really want that for it?”

I thought back Roman’s jacket, and the world around me started to spin.

Was that him? Had I found his body and never realised it?

Then who/what the hell had dragged me from my mother?

“It.” Jasper repeated. “What do you mean ‘it’? That’s my fucking brother!”

When he lunged forwards, the man pulled out something from his jacket, an iPad.

And on the screen were four separate cameras. I recognised each face.

Key, Tommy, and Zach.

Key and Tommy were walking down the strip eating ice-cream while Zach was standing outside It’s a Small World. The man’s eyes turned to me. “One word from you, buttercup, and I’ll be recruiting your friends too.”

I could have strangled Zach.

I told him to leave.

I TOLD HIM TO FUCKING LEAVE.

I wanted the man’s attention to be on me. Because I am the one who caused trouble.

Instead, though, his greedy eyes were on Roman’s younger brother.

“Peter Pan.” He said, tapping his chin. “Or, with adjustments, perhaps Hans?”

Jasper paled. “I don’t understand.”

“What is not to understand? Your brother serves us well, and we like the look of you too.”

“Go and fuck yourself.” Jasper took a shaky step back. He held up his lighter, but it wasn’t much of a weapon.

“Come anywhere near me and I swear to fucking God, I’ll torch this whole place. Just watch me, assholes.”

Jasper hissed when he was grabbed from behind by people in white who came out of nowhere. Before I could comprehend what was happening, Roman’s brother was being forcefully dragged away. 

His lighter hit the ground, and I snatched it up before any orderlies could see. As for me, I’ve been shoved back into The Scarlet Room with the promise that if I try anything, I’ll be sending Key, Tommy, and Zach to the slaughter. The man said it’s on a timer and the button can’t be manually pressed.

Because of course it can’t.

So, now I’m stuck in here—with thousands of bodies I’m scared still have their minds, deep, deep down.

I keep thinking about it.

The human body dies. It rots and decomposes.

Consciousness? It keeps going.

It keeps thinking.

Where are Roman and Maya’s bodies? If they’re gone, their performer selves would be too, right?

What did that man mean by waking up to find their bodies gone?

I’m overthinking over things that… that doesn’t even matter if I’m going to die in this room.

I have Jasper’s lighter, but what am I supposed to do?

I’ve called my friends, my family, the police. 

None of them are picking up.

I need to get Jasper out of here before he has the same fate as his brother.

Please. 

Get me out of here.

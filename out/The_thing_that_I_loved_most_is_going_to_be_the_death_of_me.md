I have always loved washing dishes. When I was younger and full of energy, I would rush to claim those as my chore, forgoing the less attractive options of laundry, mowing the lawn or ugh, the worst of the worst: dusting. The dust would settle in my nose and make me sneeze for days and though that didn’t earn me any sympathy, my insistence of doing the dishes did tip off my siblings that it was possible that I enjoyed my part in what they saw as “punishment”. They would try to jump in and claim it before me each week but I began to learn to mask how much joy I actually got from it. I would sigh and stomp my foot, my siblings snickering at the karma of it all. Haha, how funny was it that I used to love it and now I hate it haha. If only they knew.

I never really knew why I liked it so much. Maybe it was the act of it? Relaxing in its focus, my mind free to wander and let me think about what I would be when I grew up or what treats I would sneak on my way out of the kitchen. Maybe it was the rainbow bubbles floating up from my hands, showing me the beautiful things that are able to be created from the mundane. Who knows? All I knew was this was my me-time and I treasured it above all else. I craved it and the rush I got from being able to run in and caress my porcelain beauties was more than I could ever achieve in any other situation. I had tried to recreate it, washing the car, washing myself, washing counters, tables, anything but it never brought me the same feelings. 

Now as an adult, I love doing the dishes in my home and bringing myself to full peace in front of my sudsy altar. It’ll never fail to make me relaxed and noodle-like in my bonelessness when I am done. My boyfriend has always found my quirk “cute” first joking that he loved not having to do them himself. Later, he would admit that he was a little frustrated by my irritation whenever he ever tried to do them himself. Once, he made the faux-pas of purchasing paper plates. I did not speak to him for the rest of the evening. He knows what I like to do and no man will get in the way of that. He does admittedly hate how many dishes I use, a new glass for every new drink, a plate for every side and entree but I’m just quirky. I just love washing dishes. 

Today started much the same. I put on my dish-cleaning music, a mix of low romantic tones for the beginning and fast ones for the middle. I always finish off strong with some 80’s Pump-Up jams and it leaves me invigorated for the rest of the day.

I’m elbow-deep in suds, singing along to Bonnie Tyler telling me that she’s holding out for a hero and damn, Bonnie, I agree. Shaking my hips and scrubbing the remains from our breakfast dishes, I am happy and this is all I will ever need to be fulfilled. Until the plate bites me. 

I dropped it, unable to figure out at first what happened. I am filled with fear that one of my plates has broken and I frantically try to recover it from the sink. When I finally rescued it, it’s fine. I look over the plate and not a scratch. No chips where something possibly dug into the flesh that is now steadily dripping red into the water, swirling and mesmerizing in its bloom. 

I go to the bathroom and clean the wound before returning to my task. I’m a little more apprehensive but nonetheless, joyful to continue on. 

I forge on, scrubbing a different glass before I feel a constricting pain on my wrist and this time I catch it. Teeth protruding from the rim of the glass, biting me and tearing through my skin. I yelp and try to pull my wrist free before realizing that doing so will harm me further. Tears well up in my eyes and I try to shake my wrist free, running my hand under the faucet. Then, as if it was never there, the glass is just a glass and I am free.

I step back and there is silence besides my heavy breathing and Kim Carnes telling me about the focus of the song’s Bette Davis Eyes.

I don’t want to run from the room but I am scared to look back into the sink and see my blood tinting the water pink. 

I hazard a few steps forward and look into the water and sure enough, there it is. Proof of my injuries. I go to reach for the sponge because quite frankly, I am spooked and only one thing is going to calm me now. 

I squeeze the excess water from the sponge and barbs shoot into my hand, pricking me.

I shriek and drop the sponge, now even more wounded and about to pee my pants in fear as the water begins to bubble and turn like a witch’s cauldron. The dishes are moving in their nest and while before I would have been ecstatic that my fragile friends are now alive, I am horrified. While I have been taking care of them and loving them more than my own partner sometimes, have they been plotting against me?

The cupboards start to fly open and dishes begin tumbling out, accumulated from a life of singular focus. 

All the places that I have been assaulted are now becoming hard and glass-like and squishy respectively. 

I try to plead my case to the dishes but they are not listening. I finally use my legs to run to my phone and dispel the music before calling my boyfriend and sobbing out my story. 

He sighed heavily before saying, “babe, I told you that you didn’t need to do the dishes so much and now look what happened. I’ll call you back later, I’m in the middle of something that doesn’t have to do with types of soap or sentient dishes.”

I scream and the call ends. The dishes are now scooting towards me and I run to my bedroom shutting the door.

I’m writing this now from behind my closet door. I can hear them coming closer and I know that my time is almost up. My hand is becoming harder to use and my wrist feels heavy and is beginning to affect the rest of my arm. Using my sponge hand that is also beginning to have spots of porcelain show through the squishy parts, I feel the surface of my arm and gasp at the smoothness. Maybe this won’t be so bad. Maybe this wasn’t an attack. Maybe this was a welcome. 

My blood continues streaming, smearing my phone screen. My fear is still present but I try to embrace it as a promise of things to come. Please, tell my boyfriend that I don’t blame him. I just wanted to do what I loved and now I guess, I’ll never have to worry about it again. I hope someone thinks to clean me with as much care as I have provided for all of the dishes that I have ever known.

I hope that I am cherished.

It was just an ordinary Autumn day…or so I would think I was in the backyard with my friend Zander running around. Both of out parents were watching us from the balcony drinking wine and eating dinner. “I’ll race you to the swing” I said to Zander “You’re on!”he replied back. We were dashing to the tree at the end of my yard. It was head to head we made eye contact and pushed ourselves forward. 

Just then I tripped on something I fell face first into the wet grass I heard the giggles from Zander and my parents. In a calm gentle voice my mom said “Hey are you okay?” “Yes” I replied back “I think I tripped over a root.” I look at what caused my fall and it looked to be a handle. “Okay be careful sweetie” my mom said. Zander helped me up and we walked the rest of the way to the tree. Zander climbed onto the swing as I was pushing him I could not stop thinking about that handle. 

I started walking towards the handle while Zander was still on the swing “Alex!” He called at me. I did not respond back I just kept walking towards that handle. As I reached it I kneeled on the ground there were some dates on there.

 “1961-2011” I said too myself I brushed off the dirt covering the top of the box. As I was doing that it uncovered a steel box with roses as a pattern. “Woah” Zander said startling me. It just kept on going. It seemed to be at least  3 feet long. I was able to open the top of it and it was divided into sections. 

On to there was a note there. “Dear whoever is reading this, I was the first owner of this house if you found this it must be 50+ years into the future. I have put some stuff I thought was cool in this box.” There was a stop watch and some old toy cars in there. 

I opened up the second later and there was a stained blanket with flies and maggots crawling all over it. The odor that came out of it was horrid. I opened the second layer completely and I saw strands of blonde hair all over it. I opened the blanket fully and I saw it.

A dead body,chunks of hair,blood, and even flesh were stuck on the bones. “Holy fuck” I screamed. My parent cam rushing over and dragged us away. There was an envelope I took with me when I got in my room I opened it  it had a letter in it which read

”You found me…” there were pictures in there which showed the guy being stuffed alive into that box. They were scribbled in red pen with the word”I am sorry” “I should have listened” and “it’s too late”suddenly I woke up.

I looked to my side and saw it crouching in the corner of my room. “Now get rid of me” then it disappeared.

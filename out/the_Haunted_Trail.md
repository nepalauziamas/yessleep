Growing up, I knew that I had two haunted houses across the street from me. Ive documented experiences I had in both of those houses on my paranormal podcast Brave the Basement. What I didn't know was the trail next to my house was haunted too.

I would take this trail when I was in 8th grade to see a girlfriend. I could go another way, but that took me through town and out of my way. This was the shortest route to her house.

The walk is not a long walk if you know where to go. The first thing you had to do is walk across a bridge that is over an old set of train tracks that has been shut down. Once across the bridge you will see a trail leading you into the woods. As you walk along you will see other trails that will lead you off to different sections of the park. As long as you stayed to the left side it will lead you to the cemetery. Just behind the cemetery is the road that lead to my girlfriend's house. 


One night while sneaking out of my house to see my girlfriend I headed into the trails. I was moving kind of fast because I was out past curfew and didnt want to be caught. As i was heading down the trail i heard a noise like someone was walking behind me. I stopped dead in my tracks to see if anyone was there. When i turned around i didnt see anybody. I stood there for a moment and just listened. I didn't hear anything so I proceeded to walk. Soon as I took a few steps I heard the noise again. It sounded like twigs breaking. I started to wonder if I was being stalked by some wild animal.

At this point I was walking backwards a few steps and heard the noise again. It was right in front of me but too far away for me to see what it was in the dark. They were just outside of my sight. 

I stopped and said "I know you are there, come on out." And nothing. I started to take a few more steps back while looking as hard as I could through the dark of the night. I couldn't see anything.

Suddenly I felt a cold hand touch my shoulder from behind me. I spun around to see who touched me. Nobody was there. As I kept looking for whomever this was I felt the touch again. I took off running towards my girlfriend's house as fast as I could. Once I reached the clearing that led to the road I stopped to catch my breath. It was then I realized that I ran the wrong way, I should have ran back towards my house. Since I went towards her house that meant that I had to go back through the trails on the way home or I would risk getting caught by the police for breaking curfew.

I went to my girlfriend's house and tapped on her bedroom window. She opened up and I told her what happened. She laughed at the idea of me having to go back through those trails again alone in the dark because she could tell i was scared from the experience.

After listening to her laugh at me, I told her I better head back and try to get through the trails as fast as I could. She told me to call her once I got back home.

I walked back to the entrance of the trail and stood there debating whether or not to go back in. I took a deep breath and started running as fast as I possibly could. 

As I ran I could hear the sound of leaves being moved around and twigs breaking. I never stopped and just kept running until I reached my house. I never walked that trail at night again unless I had people with me.

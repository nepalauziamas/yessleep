The basement is every child's fear there is a dark that seems to swallow you whole and there is complete unknown all around. 

This was never the case for me as my basement has always been mostly lit dim in some but due to the fact it was also our home gym it had to be well lit and it was except for the left corner that light has been burnt out for years no matter what we tried no bulb worked, but I never realized that maybe it should have stayed dark.

Friday October 18th 3 am prime time to workout if your me because as an insomniac a healthy dose of exercise before bed helps me get the sleep I need and I've come to rely on it, as I went down my horrible stairs a year or 2 away from cracking when as soon as I stepped on the cold concrete I've become so accustomed to the left corner light flickered to life, for merely a moment just long enough to see a man standing under it and then it shut off.

Now as you would imagine that had really freaked me out until my inner realist gave his two cents deciding it was a trick of the light and it was probably just a jacket hung up or something like that it happens all the time, so now that I'd Givin myself the courage to go down and get my lift in.

Now I'd be lying if I Said that I wasn't still worried but I went anyway and just as before I stepped on the concrete and the light clicked on and I looked over and saw it a man grinning and shaking as if the idea of killing me or maybe eating I really don't know but It's jaw unhinged to such an unnatural size and it screamed at a deafening level and it's pale white skin started to decay and **click** the light switched off I have never run so fast in my life and I am not embarrassed to say I might have pissed myself.

I didn't sleep that night and I dont know when I'll be going down there again.

Now as much as I would love to have never go down in that basement again things need to be done, as the basement is where the cats litter box is I can't leave it and have my house smell like shit but I don't think I wanna go down there on my own yet. 

I called the cops because if there was some kind of intruder I want him out I guess in my panic that idea slipped my mind until now, and once they arrived I gave them the details that won't land me in a padded cell, as me and the 2 officers walked down the stairs the first cop officer Lincoln I think stepped on the concrete floor **click** no noise followed just the two laughing at my shitty wiring in my house but I don't think they noticed the scattered patches of dead skin in the light.

It's out of the basement or sorry that is just my assumption I got the fuck out of that place I'm now in a hotel I made sure I got a room not on ground level its a nice place its got a balcony and everything but it's quite distracting hearing the clicks of the motion activated light on the balcony.

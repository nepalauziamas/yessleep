I live in a house on a plain where no such people live. It's snowing. I take supplies from the far city and return home. Then I see a girl sitting on the edge of the house. She has a crow in her hand. I walk towards her, just when I'm about to ask her who she is, the girl says to me "it needs to be fed". Then the crow flies upward and disappears in the woods to the right of the house. Normally I live alone in this house, I have no one. That's why I want to talk to the girl, but the girl took action with the crow and was entering the house. I went home after her. 

As I entered the house, I noticed a change in the surroundings. Not only the surroundings but also the weather and light had changed, but what surprised me the most was the presence of a family I had never met in the house. A fat mother, an old father, an 8-9 year old boy, a sister who looks like a nun, and the last girl who enters the house. When I entered the house, they looked at me for a while, then the mother smiled and invited me to the ready table. I sat next to them, I haven't had such good food in a long time. Then the mother grabbed me by the shoulder and led me to a room. 

The room was like a typical student room. It consisted of a table, a chair, a cupboard, a bed, and a window. I thanked her and lay on the bed. I slept for a while, the sun was setting when I woke up. I loved the sunset, so I moved closer to the window to see it better. My room was facing the woods to the right of the house. As I was looking around, I suddenly heard the sound of a crow. A crow was flying through the woods towards the house. It was coming very quickly. While I was thinking about what this crow is doing, the crow got closer and crashed into the wall of our house with a thud. 

I was swept away by the sound. I left the house to see what happened to the crow. The crow just lay on the ground with its skull shattered into pieces. I was nauseous and thought I'd better go home. I opened the door of the house and went in… 

Something was different again. Items that weren't there before arrived, things were scattered around, the mother got even fatter, the little boy got a little older. The mother burst into tears when she saw me. She called the father from behind, the father came running and hugged me and said, "Where have you been all this time, it's been 6 months". I couldn't understand and I asked permission and went to my room. I opened the door to my room, but inside, the nun sister and 5-6 other nuns were standing on the ground, looking at a dead crow. 

Their voices stopped when they saw me. Then the nun girl looked at me and said, "Why didn't you feed it?" she said. They were all looking at me, I stepped back. I was nauseous. I left the house to vomit and went to a bush. I threw up in the bush, and when I got myself together, I realized there was something in my vomit. These were black crow feathers… 

It was getting dark, I opened the door to enter the house. The place…it was awful. It looked like it hadn't been cleaned in years. I was looking around the house. Then I saw the mother in the kitchen, her back turned. She got fatter and her hair was white. Hearing my footsteps, she turned around. Her face was wrinkled and her drooping eyes turned white, she had various scars on her face. She looked at me and said, "Have you come to feed the crow?" She grabbed a knife and started walking towards me. I stepped back and ran to the door, it was locked. Mom was slowly following behind me. 

So I ran upstairs and opened one of the rooms, inside the brother was lying with a quilt on him. “Get up! “Your mother is crazy, she wants to kill me,” I said. He weakly lifted his hand, took my arm, and said, "Did you feed the crow…?" he said. Footsteps were approaching, I had to take this sluggish boy away from here. I threw away the quilt on it for easy carrying… what is that? The boy had been amputated from the waist down. He looked at me and started laughing “you couldn't feed it, I fed the crow”. 

When I left the room, I looked to my left and the mother was halfway up the stairs. I went into the other room across the room. Old items were stored here. I quickly found a stick and headed for the mother on the ladder. She was waving the knife in her hand from side to side, and for some reason, there was a very happy expression on her face, which we can no longer call a face. I pushed her away with the long stick in my hand, and she rolled down and I came out right away. 

The first girl I saw outside was sitting alone. For some reason she hadn't changed at all. She looked at me, “If no one feeds the crow, the crow feeds itself..” she said. Then she walked towards the house, opened the door and entered. I followed him too. I opened the door. There was a body on the floor right where I dropped the woman. It looked like it had been there for months. I walked slowly to the body.

A crow was plucking small pieces from the corpse and eating it…

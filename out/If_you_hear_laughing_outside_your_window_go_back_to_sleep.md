It started with just tapping. Like a game. For a few nights it would go on tapping, and I’d sit upright in my bed, knife in hand. Watching.

Until a few nights ago, when it evolved from tapping to laughter. I’m woken up at around 2am by tapping on my window. Same routine, I get up, grab my knife, and sit back down to watch.

The tapping grows more rapid, louder with each passing second. “Hello?” I say, my blood running cold.

“*Hello…?*” My own voice croaks back. Wait a minute, *my* voice?

At this point, I’m a little fed up with the games, so i say “Who’s out there messing with me?”, thinking it’s my sister or my dad just trying to scare me. My sister happens to mock my voice pretty well.

“*Who’s out there messing with me*?” *More laughter*

What…the…fuck…that was definitely my fucking voice

I stand up, and walk slowly over to my window to investigate.

“*Who’s out there messing with me?*”

My feet stuck in place, my blood cold, and my breath unsteady, I wait. For anything. A noise, a voice, that same piercing laughter.

*Anything*

All of a sudden, someone knocks on the window. Three, light taps. “*Hello? Who’s out there messing with me*?”

Three more taps, “*Who’s out there messing with me?*”

“W-who are you?” I manage to say

“*Who are you*?” Three light taps

“*Who’s out there messing with me*”…silence

I don’t know what came over me, but in a moment of courage I grip my pocket knife and throw the curtains open.

What I saw, I can’t ever forget

It stood straight up, it didn’t have eyes but I knew it was staring at me, as I was staring at it. I couldn’t see it’s mouth, but somehow it cackled. Like a broken record, the same laughter over and over and over again like it had a recording of itself laughing and just played it on loop.

It drilled it’s way into my skull, I could still hear it even after it stopped and my curtains were closed.

“Please… leave me alone” I started to sob, as I slid down the wall opposite of my window.

“Please just leave…”

Silence

Somehow, even more chilling than the laughter.

My breath started to shallow. “Hello…?”

Nothing

I wait

1 minute

Then 2

5 minutes go by

5 more

Absolutely nothing

Did it leave…?

I stand up, wiping the tears from my cheek and neck, and side step over to my bed. Knife gripped tightly in my right hand, I sat still, eyes locked on my window.

At some point, i guess I’d fallen asleep, because at 9:30 in the morning, my mom comes in, asking me if I want pancakes. I look around, confused at how I’d just time traveled. Was it all a dream?

I pat around me to find my knife, to no avail. I can’t seem to find it.

“[Name], do you want pancakes?”

I snap back into reality, “Sure”

“Are you alright? You look sick..”

“Im okay, just tired.” I give a slight smile

“Alright, I’ll call you out when your pancakes are done.”

She leaves, shutting my door behind her.

It must have been a dream.. I found the fact comforting, that none of it was real. Everybody wants to believe their nightmares are just nightmares and nothing more.

Since then, I haven’t heard the cackling, however this morning while my family was eating breakfast, **my sister complained that there were birds tapping on her window all night**

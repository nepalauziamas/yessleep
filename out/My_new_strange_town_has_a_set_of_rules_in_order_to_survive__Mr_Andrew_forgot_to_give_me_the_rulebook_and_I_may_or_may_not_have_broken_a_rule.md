[Our first day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/y74eit/my_new_strange_town_has_a_set_of_rules_in_order/)

The creature was still whimpering outside as I was trying my best to process what had just happened. The lady came and lifted us both up, leading us to the warm living room. Her house is covered with thick gray curtains all over the windows. Esther was still shaky from what had just happened and was clinging to me. The man named Andrew is still trying to put the locks back in their place. She brought us a blanket and a tray of delicious cookies. "Have a bite, my dear," she said soothingly, but I couldn't raise my hand to take one.

"Thank you, but... we're full." I replied.

"Oh, that's absolutely alright... are you two okay?" She finally let it out, looking at my sister shaking under the same blanket as me. Comforting Esther, I looked back at the worrying lady: "No... but at least we're still alive."

"I'm sorry for putting you through that ordeal..."

She let out a sigh, and introduced herself, "My name is Rose, and the grumpy man over there is Andrew... You could call him Troy, it suits him better."

I nodded as Mr. Andrew... or Mr. Troy, finally came in and sat with us, throwing a cookie into his mouth. "You two were lucky we were still awake," he complained, "Otherwise we would have two new weird residents in this town."

"It hasn't had a good meal in a while."

"Wait, Mr. Troy, what exactly do you mean?" I frowned as I looked at him. He then turns to Mrs. Rose and says, "Should we tell them? I don't want to scare them," He inquired, slipping another cookie into his mouth.

"I'll do the speaking," she said.

"For nearly a decade, something has been haunting this town, and it's more than just some terrifying urban legends." Mrs. Rose fixed her gaze on the door. "That creature is only a minor component of that thing."

"So that thing has been existing for decades?" Esther asked. She appeared to be more concerned than ever. I tried to calm her down, despite the fact that I was terrified as well. Mrs. Rose placed her hand on Esther's back and patted it gently. "We never knew, dear," she sighed. "Until my mother was killed by it."

"I was only a small child when I heard the same voice from my grandmother. I went outside and opened it, only to discover the same thing on my doorstep. I can still remember its disgusting, inhumane grin. That same smile it had when it was devouring my mother's head."

"I'll never forget that." She slowly wiped away her tears. Mr. Troy approached and took her hand in his.

"We never knew, dearie... we never knew exactly what it was..." Sobbing, she said, wiping away her tears. I didn't know what to say, and Esther was also silent.

"I couldn't save her." Her voice was still a little raspy. "But at least we managed to save you two."

"I... Thank you," I replied, looking at her. "It was our job to do," she reassured.

She finally continued, after a short moment of silence: "My dad and I worked it all out together. We went around the town to find more information, and we found its habitat. One time, we even tried to hunt for it, though it didn't end very well." She chuckles.

"But then the town committee chimed in. They forced us to stop going out at the usual time that we would go around the neighborhood to warn everyone. And that was when we knew they had connections with that thing. It never had a name, but they worshipped it like it was some kind of god."

"That is when I realized how it had been going around, looking at us through the windows. The town committee allowed it to use their body. That is how it has been hunting, disguising itself under the appearance of the committee." She frowned, "I never quite understood how that Martha dipstick even got a hold of that creature in the first place..."

"Her husband," Mr. Troy said, throwing the final cookie into his mouth, "She did some weird ritual only to encounter that little shit."

"Can you please tell me what that ritual is?" Esther finally asked after a long break of silence. I almost thought she was sleeping the whole time. Mr. Troy replied: "Sorry to disappoint ya, but this old man has no idea, only heard it from Daniel."

"Daniel, that local hunter?" Mrs. Rose asked, taking a sip from her tea cup. Troy nodded, "It promised her something about her husband. That is why she has been so crazy about keeping the committee together."

"This town is her final salvation."

Esther's voice was even shakier than before, "So she would sacrifice this whole town for someone that doesn't even exist anymore?" She cried out. Rose held her in her arms to comfort her while her tears were falling out again. I couldn't do anything, I was shocked too. Learning that your life is hanging by a thread could be quite devastating. While patting Esther, I turned back to Troy and asked the question I've been wondering about this whole time: "How have you two been living in this monstrous town?"

"We follow a set of rules," replied Mrs. Rose, "Made by my dad and I. Isn't that great?"

"Rules? What kind of rules?" I asked, appearing to have little faith in the so-called "rules". Rose smiled as she put down the sleeping Esther onto the couch. "I'd love to introduce it to you, but dearie, shouldn't you be sleeping by now?"

"But-"

"Now now, it's 4 in the morning and you haven't slept for almost 2 hours. Just to be sure, tomorrow, Troy and I will renovate your house. You wouldn't want someone looking at you through those windows, right?"

"Don't worry pal, we have a notebook that we've written all of them in. And we'll give it to you when we're done renovating your house."

I didn't want to argue because my eyes were half closed. All the things that have happened really took a toll on me. I just nodded before settling down on the couch to get some rest.

This is enough for the day.

It was about another 3 hours when Esther woke me up. Mr. Troy had a tool box with him, while Mrs. Rose was holding a thick pile of cloth. They escorted us back to our house and started to renovate it. Troy installed three additional sets of locks on our doors and windows, while Rose strung all of the window treatments. We gave each other our phone numbers so that we could stay in touch and waved them off as they went back to their house.

I finally let out a sigh of relief as we were finally back at our house. But Esther was still a bit shaky. I can't blame her. After everything that happened last night, we were concerned about living in this town. I was planning to call my mom until there was a sudden knock on the door. Esther and I looked at each other in horror. Could it be that creature again?

I stood up and looked through the peephole. It was a mailman, smiling while holding a box. It doesn't seem like that cashier from yesterday. I decided to open the door anyway. Nothing could go wrong, right?

"A delivery for Ms. Nguyá»…n."

"Oh, thanks." I took the box from his hand. Still with that smile, he nodded and went back to his truck. I brought the package inside and locked the door immediately. Esther was suspicious about the box that I was holding.

"Could it be mom's?" I asked, examining the package. She shook her head, "I don't know, it doesn't seem like... huh, is it your phone ringing?"

I took out my phone only to get scolded in the face: "WHY DID YOU TAKE THE BOX FROM THE MAILMAN? ARE YOU INSANE?"

It was Mrs. Rose. She was so angry that I couldn't imagine a sweet lady like her being that furious. "But, it's our mom's package. What's the matter?"

"You haven't read the rulebook yet?"

"What rulebook?"

"Oh no... Troy forgot to give you the book, hasn't he?"

"Yes..."

"Okay, Rachel. I need you to listen carefully. You don't have to worry about the box, just don't go out by any chance. I repeat, **DO. NOT. GO. OUT.**"

"But, why?"

"**He's still standing at your door, and he is coming to your house tonight**." She said, her shaky voice even scaring me more.

"Wait, wait, wait! Mrs. Rose, what are you saying? How could he come into our house when we've locked the door?" I interjected.

"You just invited him into your house by receiving the package, and nothing could stop you from coming into your house at midnight."

*Oh fucking no.*

"So, we're going to die?" I gushed, worryingly looking at Esther. She seemed both concerned and confused. The sound of paper flipping echoed from the other side of the line, and then Rose finally replied: "Not if you hide in your modified closet."

"You mean the closet with locks on it?"

"I believe that's the one. Remember to hide inside the-" A long beep followed. Our line has been cut off. "*Fuck*." I silently cursed under my breath, Esther came and put her hand on my back.

The knob on the main door starts turning rapidly. I don't think we can handle this much longer.

**My new strange town has a set of rules in order to survive - Mr. Andrew forgot to give me the rulebook and I may or may not have broken a rule.**

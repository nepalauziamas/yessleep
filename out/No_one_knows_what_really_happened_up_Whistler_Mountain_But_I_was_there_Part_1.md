Three bodies found in a remote log cabin, a gun lying beside them that hadn’t been fired. The police, the courts, the local media, all baffled. 

Oh, to be a fly on the wall that day, the gossipers and the gorehounds said. Well, I was in that cabin. I heard every word as I lay there in silence terrified that what had happened to me was going to happen again. That it was going to happen to someone else, that I was going to be trapped forever.

But I have a voice now. A vessel. I have taken possession of a True Crime fanatic obsessed by the murders. She strayed to close to the cabin and I pounced. I'm finally going to share what I heard and what I saw – **my parting gift**.

I must work fast. They say the killer always returns to the scene of the crime. I'm scared they will come for my new vessel, and the killer is doubtless the most ruthless and deceitful person I ever crossed in what was once my life.

It all started with a woman sitting beside the cabin’s CB Radio, searching through the frequencies.

Rose: "Hello? Can anyone hear me? Anyone?"

And the man who answered her.

Chopper: "Well howdy, stranger. This is Chopper reading you loud and clear. Over."

Rose: "Oh, hello. Er, 10-4."

Chopper: "Ha! Looks like I found myself a rookie rig. First lesson, honey, end any transmission with ‘over’. Shows you’re done talkin’. Over."

Rose: "Right, got it. Over."

Chopper: "Nice. So what’s your handle, honey? Over."

Rose: "My handle? Well, my name is Rose. Over."

Chopper: "Nice to talk to ya, Rose. Folks call me Chopper. Now, I ain’t exactly the sharpest tool in the box, but even I can tell you’re not from around these parts. Over."

Rose: "No, I’m from England. I’m on holiday here with my fiancé. Over."

Chopper: "Aww, a pair o’ love birds. You guys road trippin’ cross-state together? Over."

Rose: "No, we’ve rented a cabin actually. The tour operator said it used to be a hunting lodge, but it’s been converted into a holiday home. I think that’s why the place still has this old CB Radio. Over."

Chopper: "Sounds about right, Rose. Often times snow comes down hard and fast out in the sticks. In years gone by you’d hear tales of hunters stranded in a lodge for weeks on end. A CB Radio was a must so they could contact the outside world. Over."

Rose: "Oh, I see. You know, it’s funny, it’s so isolated up here. There’s no phone signal, no Wi-Fi, nothing like that. This radio is all Michael and I have. I guess we’re a bit like the hunters of old. We’re getting the proper American adventure experience. Over."

Indeed, the adventure of a lifetime. Or at least the adventure to end three lifetimes.

Chopper: "So, are you enjoying your big adventure, Rose? Over."

Rose: "Yes, the scenery up here is stunning. Over."

Chopper: "Great to hear! Say, ol’ Chopper’s curious. Where’s your fiancé – Michael wasn’t it? Where is he now? He on the horn with you too? Over."

Rose: "No, Michael’s not here. He’s, well, he’s gone for a walk. Over."

Chopper: "Mighty fine evening for it. Over."

Rose: "I suppose it is … So, what about you, Chopper? Where are you right now? Are you driving? Will you be out of range soon? Over."

Chopper: "Well, I am in my rig but I’m parked up on a cosy little road just off the interstate. Got a real nice view of Whistler Mountain. Over."

Rose: "Wow, you’re probably not far from our cabin. We’re a little way up Whistler Mountain; Weaver’s Rise. Do you know it?"

Chopper: "Can’t say I do, Rose. I’m from out of state. But if I am nearby, that’d explain why the signal’s so good, why I can hear you so well. Over."

Rose: "I see. So how come you’re not driving, Chopper? Are you on a rest stop? Over."

Chopper: "Yeah, somethin’ like that. Say, tell me if I’m crossing the line here, but I’m curious. A beautiful evening, your sweetheart goes for a stroll along the mountainside and you stay in the cabin to play with an old radio? Everything all right up there? Over."

Rose: "It’s okay that you ask, Chopper. I suppose it’s not hard to tell that something’s up. Michael and I had an argument. A bad one. Over."

Chopper: "I’m real sorry to hear that, Rose. What happened? Over."

Was Chopper sorry to hear that? I remember thinking he wasn't, I remember thinking he sensed an opportunity.

Rose: "It's stupid really, but we were arguing about the date of our wedding. I think Michael is sick of me asking about it. He got angry and stormed off. He shouted something about walking to Pitwell, but that’s miles away, and … sorry, you really don’t want to hear this ..."

Chopper: "No, it’s good to talk, Rose. What’s the problem with the wedding date? Do ya both wanna get hitched at different times? Over."

Rose: "It’s not that. After we got engaged, Michael lost his job. It took him a few months to find a new one and, in that time, we burned through all our savings. Michael wanted to put off arranging the wedding until we’d built them back up again. But we’ve both been working for a year now, Michael even has a much better job than he had before. We can afford this expensive holiday but apparently we still can’t afford a wedding. It’s frustrating. I just want to pin down a date, but he keeps brushing me off. Over."

Chopper: "That’s a pickle, Rose. And I can see why it’s getting to you. Do you think Michael might be worried about losing his job again? Afraid he won’t be able to support you? Bein’ out of a job mighta hurt his pride. Over."

Rose: "I don’t think it’s that. He seems to be doing really well with his new job. I think he gets on a lot better with his new colleagues too. I’m just worried that – that he’s having second thoughts about marrying me, and that’s why he doesn’t want to talk about a date. Over."

Chopper: "I hope that’s not the case, Rose. Now, I ain’t no love guru, but I was going steady with a lady once, and I was blamin’ her for things that weren’t her fault. When she up and left I realised I shoulda talked to her about what was going on instead of lashin’ out. Over."

Rose: "That's a shame. I'm sorry, Chopper. Over"

Chopper: "S’alright, was a long time ago. Point is, communication is key. Have you sat down with Michael and told him everything you just told me? Told him you’re worried he’s havin’ second thoughts? And that, if he is, you wanna talk about it? Over."

Rose: "No, but maybe you're right, Chopper. Maybe I should. If he ever comes back, that is. Over."

Chopper: "When exactly did he leave? Over."

Rose: "Not long before I turned on the radio and found you. I just wanted to find someone who would actually talk to me rather than run off in a huff. Over."

Chopper: "I can see why you'd feel that way, Rose. Over."

Rose: "Thanks. I must admit I’m worried though. It’ll be dark soon and this cabin is so secluded. I’m a bit scared Michael won’t be able to find his way back. Over."

Chopper: "Don't worry, Rose. He'll turn up. Over."

Rose: "I hope so. Anyway, I better go and turn on all the lights, stoke the fire so Michael can see the chimney smoking from a distance. It was nice talking to you, Chopper. Over."

Chopper: "Pleasure was all mine, Rose. Good luck to ya. To both of ya. Over and out."

Rose: "Over and out."

A click, and the CB was switched off.

Rose: "And now I wait."

And so she did wait. And she did stoke the fire, and she did turn on all the lights. All whilst I watched on, helpless.

Nightfall, and there was an anxious energy in the cabin.

Rose: "Where is that idiot?"

It wasn't long until the CB was switched back on. 

Rose: "Hello? Can you hear me? Chopper?"

Chopper: "That you, Rose? Everything alright up there? Over."

Rose: "Thank God you’re still there, Chopper. My fiancé, Michael. He hasn’t come back yet. It’s dark and I’m getting really worried something’s happened to him. Over."

Chopper: "Are you still all alone up there? Over."

Rose: "Yes, just me. I know Pitwell is a long way off, but Michael should have calmed down and turned around. He should be back by now. What if he’s slipped and banged his head? Or bears, are there bears up here? I don’t know what to do, Chopper. Over."

Chopper: "And how long do you have the cabin for? How long ‘til the next lot of vacationers move in? Over."

Rose: "We have to be out in four days. But why does that matter? Over."

Chopper: "You need to listen to me, Rose. I have Michael. Over."

Rose: "You … *have* Michael? Wha – I don’t understand."

Chopper: "I got to Michael and I knocked him unconscious. He’s tied up and gagged in the back of my rig. Over."

Rose: "Why – why would you do that? What’s going on?"

Chopper: "I have Michael and, if you want him to live past tonight, you need to do exactly as I say. Do you understand? Over."

Rose: "Please, don’t hurt him. What do you want? Money? I have some money."

Chopper: "This ain’t about your money, Rose. Michael will make it through tonight so long as you do exactly as I say. Go against me and he dies. Do we have an understanding? Over."

Rose: "Yes, please, just don't hurt him, Chopper."

Chopper: "Do what I tell you and ain’t nothing gonna happen to him. Now, I’m gonna drive up to you, then I’ll stop outside your cabin. When you see me, come out with your hands raised, pockets turned out. Do you understand? Over."

Rose: "Yes … I understand …"

Chopper: "Good. I need you to promise me you won’t try nothing. If you do, it’ll be you and Michael that come off worse. This can all go down without anyone getting hurt, but if it comes to it I can – and I will – do bad things. Do you promise me you won’t try nothin’? Over."

Rose: "I – I promise."

Chopper: "Good. Now, I need to know that you still have all the lights in your cabin switched on, and that your chimney is still smokin’. Is that right, Rose? Over."

Rose: "Yes, lights and a fire. Please, just don’t hurt Michael, please."

Chopper: "If you do as I say, no one is gonna get hurt. I’m coming to find you now; Weaver’s Rise, a little way up the mountain. Remember, hands raised, pockets turned out. Are we clear, Rose? Over."

Rose: "Yes, yes, I'll do whatever you say."

Chopper: "Glad to hear it. Over and out."

More soon, keeping control is exhausting.

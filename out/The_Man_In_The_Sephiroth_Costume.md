My name is Anna. I am a 20-year-old Gothic girl and this story happened back last year in 2021 a week before I turned 19 and was just getting into Goth. Anyway, it was January of 2021 and Nintendo has just placed Sephiroth from Final Fantasy VII into Super Smash Bros: Ultimate. I played as Sephiroth a couple of times before this happened and please remember that Sephiroth is a big part of the story.  I was in the bathroom one day talking in the mirror about Sephiroth and laughing about him not thinking that it would be that much harm since Sephiroth is obviously a fictional character that was created by Squaresoft/Square Enix for Final Fantasy VII. 

However, something unexpected and spooky happened to me that I would never forget. I looked up at the mirror as I was washing my hands and saw my mom's closet slowly open. Then, I saw a man with long silver hair, green eyes, pale skin, and wearing an outfit that looked remotely similar to Sephiroth's outfit in Kingdom Hearts I and Kingdom Hearts II. I was paralyzed with fear as I watched this all happen and what came out of his mouth was basically the most bone-chilling thing I've ever heard, "So you've chosen death." 

Within a few seconds, the man disappeared. I snapped out of my trance and came back to my senses, believing that it was all just nothing. Unfortunately, it was not to be, because when I looked back at the closet door, I saw it open and literally realized that someone was in my house. I stayed in the bathroom for nine more minutes afterward; not knowing what to do. Whether I should call the police, check if my parents came home, or just sit in the bathroom because I didn't know if he was still in the house or not. 

Once those nine minutes were up, I turned off the lights and tiptoed my way out of the bathroom. I then heard a noise coming from the door, out of fear, I screamed and ran out of my parents' room. Luckily, they had already come back with food from Sonic Drive-In and my Dad allowed me to have some of his Expresso shakes. And now, if you think the story ends there, then you are wrong. 


Actually, this story has quite a long stretch from him showing up in my house multiple times which included him staring straight at me into the pits of my soul, and one time, he even gave me the middle finger. One time, he even followed me to my college after my dad dropped me off for singing practice and pointed something sharp at my back. I was confused and literally thought that something was trying to get inside me. I resisted it for a while only to turn around and see him there looking at me. I quickly went inside the building but didn't tell any of my friends about what happened or what had been happening...at least, not for another month. 

This wasn't the first time he did something like this to me at my college. He was even walking behind me unnoticed back less than a month before and I didn't even catch that it was him all until he did it again in a Brookshire's story. The next month, I didn't go into shock or get paralyzed in fear when I saw him, even though I still was afraid, I was more annoyed and couldn't wonder why I couldn't talk about Sephiroth without getting a response from that guy. 

I was getting pretty fed up and got even more uncomfortable when I saw him drop his boot behind the closet door while I was taking a bath one night. I didn't have a bubble bath or anything, so if he would have walked into the bathroom or peaked into the cracks of the door, he would have seen me completely naked. Now since I didn't have my phone with me during that time, I couldn't take a picture of it so I had to draw what I saw on paper. I no longer have the drawing to this day, but I have copies on it on my phone and on my laptop. 

Anyway, when my 2nd fall semester of college came, I made some new friends at college and actually told them about what happened. He would seem to get angry when I told people about what he did, but come on! What does that slut expect?! He was stalking me and I don't wanna keep this a secret, even though I never told anyone in my family about this, just my youngest brother, Ashton. My parents, my other younger brother Joshua, my aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents have no idea that this stuff had happened to me. 

I got so fed up that one time, I even apologized to the so-called "Sephiroth", hoping that he'd get the message and move on, unfortunately, he did not. He would come by to my house and do a lot of things that I didn't like and would even through rocks on my window and do the same if I was talking about Sephiroth at college. I even apologized to him twice in October and he did the EXACT same thing I didn't want him to do. I was scared that something like this would happen, even back when it first started. I got so desperate that I even started begging for him to leave me alone and to stop stalking me for good. Thankfully, in November, he didn't return for a week and I was convinced that he got the message for good and decided not to stalk me anymore. 

I was able to live a life in peace and even celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, my 20th birthday, and Valentine's Day undisturbed, but in early March of this year, I was taking a walk alone in the dark and heard some weird noises coming from behind me. At first, I thought it was an owl or a cat, but things got even weirder. I even started to run and heard a pair of footsteps running from behind me. I stopped to catch my breath and heard a man's heavy breaths a foot away from me. I screamed and cursed. 

Without any time to spare, I ran to my dad who was busy talking to some family members after the cookout we just had that night. I told my dad that I thought someone was in the yard and asked him to search with me. Thankfully, when my dad search for me, there was no one there. I wish I could say that was the last time, but unfortunately, it wasn't. Back in late April when I had just gotten out of my second spring semester in college, someone drove into our yard like they did last year; only this time, I could hear the outdoor dog, who is a Great Pyrenees barking. In fear, I locked the door to my room and didn't get much sleep that night. 

The next time something weird just happened was a couple of nights ago. While I was getting ready to sleep with our indoor dog, Zoey who is a Shih Tzu as I heard what sounded like a finger tapping and stretching coming from my window. Yesterday, I looked at my window and saw a few scratch marks near the middle of my bedroom window. I was freaked out. 

Back last year, I was afraid that my stalker would kidnap me and probably sexually molest, sexually assault, rape, or do something much worse to me. Right now, I'm more scared that he may be closer to doing it than he was last year. Now, I really wish I didn't have to say this, but sometimes, I don't even believe that he went away, but is still lurking in the darkness; waiting for me to say something mean about Sephiroth again so that we can probably have another round again. I'm still very much scared and I'm more scared than I was last year for what could happen to me.  As I text this down, please don't ignore my story. As misguided as this might sound, this story is ONE HUNDRED PERCENT real and I believe that my stalker may get even madder if I told the Internet this, but I can't let him have power over me. 

As I stalking victim, I believe that my voice should be heard. God only knows what could have happened if he kidnapped me last year and God only knows what will happen to me later on in life. We'll just have to see what the future has in store for me. All I can say is that I pray for the best and hope that the worst doesn't happen.

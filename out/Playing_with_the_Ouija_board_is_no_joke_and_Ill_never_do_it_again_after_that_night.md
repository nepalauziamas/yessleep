I'm a terrible writer so here goes nothing but this actually happened to me  

This happened when I was 11 almost 12 and my friend Klarra who was also 12, she and I lived in the same neighborhood so we became very close. And on occasion her parents would have her babysit her two little sisters when they would go out for a few hours, one night I was over at Klarras house helping her babysit and we were having a good time but became bored of being on the computer, and roaming around her house, we had told her two little sisters we were going to go in her room for a little while and they were busy playing a video game in their room so they didn't really care, she told them if they needed us to just come in the room... 




So we go into her room which was like the typical 10x10 room but she had her room decked out in like antique type decor, stuff passed down to her front relatives, and they had all types of really cool stuff like that throughout her house anyways...
Klarra had one of those glow in the dark Ouija boards you could get at Spencer's gifts. After about 30 minutes of Klarra literally begging me..


 she finally convinced me to sit with her in her room, in the dark, and play with the Ouija board... 
I told her before we even started to play to please Klarra, please do not ask anything stupid because I was already pretty scared of these things! but she assured me she wouldn't ask anything crazy, so we proceeded to play, she lit a few candles that she had on her dresser, placed the board on the floor and then turned the lights off, 




We were on our stomachs with our elbows propping us up and we began to ask the usual questions
Is there any spirits here that would like to communicate?
Nothing....


We asked again, Is there any spirits here that want to make there presence known? 
And very very slowly it slid over to Yes
Klarra asked, how many people are here?
The board went to the number 3
We sorta laughed and she told me
Oh I think the board is counting itself!
It then slid to Yes
She then asked a question I never anticipated
Can you show me hell?
Right then it started doing figure 8 on the board over and over and over, until it darted to each corner of the board...
I screamed at her and said WTF! I told you,
And all of a sudden we felt glued to the floor, from the neck down we couldn't move anything but our heads... 




And instantly felt something very very dark...
We heard a reply from what appeared to be coming from her closet, 
As the door to her closet slid open
We saw the most horrifying demonic being with yellow and black eyes peer at us and he said in the most demonic growl
I can show you hell
Do you like what you see???





It literally was like this huge black mass in the form of a very buff very huge guy but with a blue of black for a face and cat like yellow and black eyes... Those eyes....
We were just frozen in place and at that point I just started praying in my head for God and all his angels to please save me because I was absolutely terrified!!! 




I looked over to my friend Klarra and asked her if she could move at all and I'm not sure if we were frozen in fear or actually stuck to the floor but it felt like it lasted an eternity... 
I just kept praying I told Klarra to pray and her being Buddhist she was chanting to herself and I continued to just ask for God to help..
Finally we were able to move but what we didn't realize was how long we were actually in her room... 




I got to her house just before sunset which during summer time is usually around 730ish.. 
By the time we were able to move to get to the door it was now almost 10pm and her sisters stared at us all confused asking why we wouldn't answer the door? Why did we lock the door ? 
We never locked the door. 
Klarra asked her two sisters how long they had been standing there, to which they both replied "We have been at your door knocking and pounding on the door for over 45 minutes, we heard weird sounds like scratching and screeching so we wanted to see what you guys were doing.."




I immediately called my mom and begged her to come pick me up and told her what I did, she got there so fast... I didn't go back to her house for years after that...
Still freaks me out to the core to this day. Sorry I'm not the best writer lol hope you guys never ever play with this board it's fucked up.. her mom had to close the board for us which sucks and is scary.. 
My mom had to do all types of cleansings and shit to help me get rid of it from following me home... 
Never again have I ever touched another ouija board and I never again will! That's my story..

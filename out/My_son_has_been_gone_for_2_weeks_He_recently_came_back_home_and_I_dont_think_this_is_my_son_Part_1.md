 

“Jesus christ Max, Where the hell have you been?” I yelled out at my son who just came home after being missing for 2 weeks.

I ran up to hug him but he pushed me away. I was surprised at this as he has always been a hugger, a nice guy. Never swore, never did drugs, always home before his curfew. I could tell that something was clearly wrong. He reeked of sweat and alcohol. This is not like him, he pushed me away and walked straight to his room and locked the door behind him. I ran after in order to talk to him. I knocked furiously on the door and yelled.

“Max! Where the hell have you been? You come home two weeks later stinking of sweat and alcohol! This is not like you, son”

All I could hear was silence. After repeating the same sentence multiple times I gave up… I went over to the couch and slumped down defeated. I cried so hard that I could no longer breathe, I was relieved that he was home, but I was filled with bitter anguish at the state of my son. After a while I fell asleep on the couch. When I woke up the next morning it was 6:17 AM, I took a shower, got dressed and ate breakfast and then went to say goodbye to Max. I knocked on his door and tried to open it, the door slid open. But my son wasn't there. Which I found odd as it was just 7:00 AM, and school doesn’t start until 8.

I did something which I still regret to this day, I walked in side to look around a bit, but as soon as I set foot in the room a putrid pungent smell came from somewhere, after looking around a bit I found the source. The wardrobe, I tried to pull it open but it was locked. I don’t remember there ever being a lock on this wardrobe as I had built it with Max when he was 7. I tried to find the lock but I couldn’t find it, which must mean it’s on the inside.

I did something stupid, I stepped back a bit and charged at it full force to try and brake the door down. After a few times of throwing my full body weight at it, the door cracked. I screamed out in pain as a large splinter pierced through my shirt and straight into my shoulder. As I backed up I saw a glimpse of what was inside it. I saw what looked like the bottom half of a face, the smell got worse as it poured out from the wardrobe. I puked my guts out from the pure putrid smell of death.

I gathered myself after a few minutes and started pulling at the splintered door which had been weakened from my charging. My heart was pumping as I was pulling as hard as I could, splinters stabbed into my hands as I was trying my best to get a better view at the rotting corpse that was locked in my son's wardrobe. I finally got through. As I stood there looking at the corpse I saw that multiple pieces of flesh were ripped off the bones. The body was missing patches of skin, maggots were crawling all over it, some had gathered inside the mouth and others had eaten away at the lips.

The left one was missing, I thought it must have been eaten by the maggots, but then I remembered something. My son has green eyes, but when he came home yesterday, only the left one was green, but the right one… the right one was purple.

I sprinted out of there as quickly as I could, I ran and ran till my lungs were burning. I stopped at a cafe and pulled up my laptop. I'm now sitting here, A big blood stain on my shoulder with a piece of wood sticking out, writing this using the cafe's wifi. It's now 9:37 AM, and I'm starting to think what came home yesterday is not my son...

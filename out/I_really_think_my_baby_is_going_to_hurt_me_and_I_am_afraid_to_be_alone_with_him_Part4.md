I would like to apologize for my recent outbursts and for blaming my petty, insignificant problems on my precious little boy Harry, especially when there are so many important things I should have been focused on. I can’t believe how selfish I was, I should never have tried to hold him back. I blame society, it brainwashed me into believing just because Harry was different, there was something wrong with him and I let that scare me. This caused him pain, I am still really angry with myself over that, I would have never been able to forgive myself if something had happened to him. Anyway, since when is being different a bad thing, I think people are just afraid of what they don’t understand. Some might call him evil, what does that even mean? How many people died in the name of God, is he evil. Good and evil is how you perceive it, look at literally every war, both sides will always argue that their actions are just, yet none could be called innocent with the atrocities that happen in the battle fields, but that’s just the world we live in. 

I will never again make the mistake of believing he is a monster, I was just oblivious to the truth back then, blinded by my own insecurities. I lived my life lost, unable to see the world for what it really was, like so many others, until that special night. I am so grateful that he is so understanding, I don’t think anyone else would have forgiven me so easily. Then again, I suppose there is no one else like him out there, which makes me feel so special for having the privilege of taking care of him, I will treasure that for an eternity.   

I will admit that night when he first opened up, I could not handle it and freaked out, it is a lot to take in for an inferior being like me. That's why most minds crack under the pressure, like that poor babysitter Jean, it was an awful pity, Harry really liked her. But you never know our paths might cross again. Unlike her, once I got my head around it, it was as if a veil had been lifted, I could see everything, *and it was spectacular*. All my worries and fears melted away, I am not ashamed to say I cried, the pure scale and beauty of what he showed me was overwhelming. It was like a dream, how I wish I could live in that moment, forever. Don't worry, you won't be forgotten, everyone will get their chance, eventually, which makes me so jealous, I wish I could go back and do it all over again.  

Well anyways, the past is the past and that's where we will leave it, but the future is much more brighter now thanks to my precious little Harry. I love him so much, it hurts; I just know that he is going to do amazing things, and I will make sure nothing will get in his way. My husband nearly had me believe he was the devil with the way he was acting before he left, so silly, he should have accepted Harry for what he is, and we would be still together now as a family. Which makes me a little angry at times, but it doesn’t matter now, nothing does, only Harry. The problem is poor Harry really misses his dad, he wanted to show him the truth, but unfortunately, my husband rudely left before he could finish. Which is sad for him, he missed out on such an amazing opportunity.  

Lucky for him not all is lost, Harry was in a forgiving mood and we both agree it would be unfair if he was left out of all the fun, since he was such a big part of how it all began. So, we paid a visit to his sister in hopes of finding out where he could have gone, she was a little bit naughty and tried to keep it a secret from us, but being the exceptional child that he is, Harry knew exactly what to do. Unfortunately, her mind wasn’t ready to see the truth and there was a little booboo. I guess some people are just too stuck in their ways, with her demons and angels talk, did she not understand that Harry is none of those things, he is so much, much more.  

I’m sorry if I'm rambling again, I am just so proud of my perfect little boy Harry, it is so exciting. Ok, she told me my husband went to Lourdes France to find himself, I told her not before my little boy finds him first. Lourdes ha, can you believe that, I will be honest with you; I never saw him as the religious type, especially after what my precious little boy showed him, I suppose it takes time for some people to see the truth, even if it is standing right in front of them. 

In the end we decided it would be a good idea to pay him a visit, I know he would never be expecting it, he will be so happy when he sees us. Harry is so excited he can barely keep it in, he really wants us to be a family once more, even if it is only for a short time. To try relax him, I called a babysitter, I know you might think its cruel, but is a lion cruel for killing and eating a gazelle or dolphin for eating a mackerel, no because it is in their nature. These were the needs he had before that I didn’t understand, once they are filled, he will act like the perfect little angel he is again. Besides he doesn’t try to hurt anyone, if they just let him in, they would be like me and live in constant bliss, unfortunately that wasn’t the case this time and he had another accident.  

I don’t mind cleaning up the mess after him, it’s nothing a little hard work and a bit of elbow grease can’t fix. There is no point in crying over spilt milk, is there, plus it was all for a good cause, so I don’t feel bad about it. Anyways there are bigger fish to fry, our flight leaves at noon tomorrow, Harry tells me when he is done with his dad, he will have a big surprise waiting for me. I can’t hardly wait; I just love surprises. I am going to try my best to enjoy this, it will be our last holiday, because when we get home, the real work will begin. I can't say anymore, or I will ruin the surprise, and Harry won’t like that, will he.

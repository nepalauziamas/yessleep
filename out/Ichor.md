 My name is Esme Dauphine Fleur de Lys. I was seventeen when the French Revolution began and even fought at the barricade with my four brothers. Hell, we were dirt poor bastards with an invisible mother who worked eighty-hour work weeks, and there was nothing else exciting going on at the time. Between rifle volleys, I flitted between the wounded, offering what little help or comfort I could. That nauseating smell of rot, pennies, and raw meat overwhelmed the front lines of the barricade, but I put on my big girl stomach so I did not vomit; I did not falter. The things I saw were beyond the pale of horrific: gore, fear, pain, humiliation... But none it was more terrifying than what I experienced while I tended to Benoit, the only brother I had left -- Yves, Henri, and Aubin having not lived past the first day.  

"Tout va bien, mon frère," I whispered to him, fighting back hot tears. *It will be ok,* I reassured. "Regarde-moi, regarde-moi." *Look at me.* "Ne meurs pas, doux frère. S'il vous plaît. Tu vivras, Benoit, s'il te plait. Vous vivrez!" *You will live.*  

Hi large, grey eyes rolled around to find my own and focused on me. He did not cry out as I stripped him of his vest and shirt. But his forehead beaded with perspiration and I could almost feel the hot agony radiating forth from his eyes like a furnace that scalded my face. His right arm was shattered from the fall off the top of the barricade and already starting to bruise, the blood within pulsing freely, no longer confined to veins. With every beat of his heart, blood bubbled up like weak geysers from three separate holes in his abdomen and one in his chest, perilously close to his heart. I wept freely then as I looked upon his broken body.  

"Ah Beniot. N'ayez pas peur. Je suis là. Esmé est là." Do not be afraid, I beseeched him. He made a soft grunting noise and a small trickle of blood emerged from his mouth and ran down the side of his chin. A tortured wail rose up in my throat as I thought him dead. But before it could rent its horrible way out of my mouth, a hand suddenly grasped my forearm with such strength the wail in my throat quivered and died.  

"Je n'ai pas peur, soeur Esme. Pas de la mort. Eloignez-vous de moi, je vous en supplie, et laissez-moi mourir en paix*."* He said violently in a great and terrible voice.  

***I am not afraid, sister Esme. Not of death. Be gone from me, I beg you, and let me die in peace.***  

People say many things while they stare mortality in its hollow eyes and wait for death -- I should know, with how many men I've sat with while they waited. But few wish you gone from their side in order to die alone. In fact, when I think about it now, during my time on the barricades, all the dying men I encountered begged me to stay with them, to hold their hand, to not leave until they were at last sleeping. None wished to wait for their appointment with the Reaper alone. I shook my head, refusing to believe he wanted me gone, my tears falling upon his face.  

"Non-sens. Jamais. Je ne vous laisserai pas seuls dans cette tâche." *Nonsense,* I whispered to him and stroked his sweaty blonde hair from his impossibly young face. *I will not leave you,* I told him.  

Benoit's eyes swiveled from me to something behind me, just over my shoulder. He began to shake and tried to pull his hand from my own. His eyes were wide with unrestrained horror and his chest heaved as if he were trying to scream. But I was naïve then, so I held onto his hand even harder, thinking the fright of death had consumed him. 

"Ne me touche pas, Esmé. S'il vous plaît! Tu ne comprends pas. Aller! Aller! Avant qu'il ne soit trop tard." 

***Do not touch me, Esme. Please! You do not understand. Go! Go! Before it is too late.***  

But by then it was too late. His eyes glazed over, his hand went limp in my own, he let out his last breath with a mumble, and he died. 

A mumble. That is what I first told myself in the weeks following his death. A mumble. But I was naïve then, as I said. I'm not any longer. It was no mumble. It was a word, a name, a curse.  

Well, this is the moment you get to make your choice about me, though I care not which choice you make whether it be sympathy, empathy, or apathy. But looking back I wish I had have heeded him. I wish I *had* left him alone to die. But hindsight is a terrible taskmaster and there is nothing I can do about it now. Paint me with your blackest brush, but my feelings will forever remain the same. I wish I had left. I wish I had left. 

***Ichor.*** 

His mumble; his last word. 

***Ichor.*** 

My God, forgive me, I wish I had left.

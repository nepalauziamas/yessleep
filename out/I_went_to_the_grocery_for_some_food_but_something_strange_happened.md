I live in a small town located in the suburbs of Texas, where it is rarely crowded and traffic jams along with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, so very few people go out. That day I was on my way to buy food for my cat - Bella when I met some people talking about a strange creature appearing in the forest. But I didn't mind because I didn't believe in ghost things and kept going to that store. The autumn weather is quite cool, so I feel very comfortable.

When I got there, I opened the door and walked in, went to the pet counter, chose my cat's favorite food, and then went to the checkout. Suddenly the hostess asked me a very strange question: "Do you like dogs or cats?", I answered cats because as you can see I am raising a cat.

I realized my stomach was aching, I think it was because I ate an expired burrito last night. I immediately ran to the toilet, while I was going to the bathroom, I suddenly heard a strange hiss and the lights suddenly went out, there was a lonely wind as if to tell me to run away before it was too late. A footstep right in front of the bathroom door scared me to sweat, he banged on the bathroom door very violently. I tried not to make any sound because I was too scared. The knocking on the door suddenly stopped with a thin, white hand reaching into the toilet., he seems to want something from me. I asked him, "What do you want?" But he didn't answer, but slowly got up and left. I thought it was over here, but he came back with a chainsaw sound, and at that moment I realized it wasn't that simple. He looked like he wanted to break the door, and I immediately saw a ventilation hole in the wall. Finding an opportunity to escape, I stood up on the toilet and climbed out from the ventilation hole.

It was extremely difficult for me to crawl out because the ventilation hole was not big enough. I managed to escape, I looked behind me and a weird man was wearing a black suit and strangely he seemed to have no legs. I noticed that he was chasing me, and sensed that I immediately ran into the forest.

While I was running into the woods, I looked back to see if he was gone. But no, the distance between me and him was getting closer and closer, realizing that things were getting worse, so I ran into a cave, that cave was extremely dark and wet, I still smell some dead animals. Seeing a hole, I ran into it. I sat nestled in that hole, from afar I saw him walking into the cave. Looks like he recognized me. Thinking I was being caught, I took the knife my grandfather always told me to carry with me and pointed it at his heart, hoping for a miracle. I ran to him and stabbed the knife into his weak spot, blood still gushing from his chest. Seeing that he looked like he was about to collapse, I pulled out my knife and stabbed him again to finish him off. I paused for a moment to make sure he was dead. I went out of the cave in a very confused mood and went home and hug Bella and think that today was a special day.

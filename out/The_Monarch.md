So  a few months ago me and my husband of 3 years, who I will call Thomas, found a house on a very sketchy website but pretty cheap compared to most. It was a very beautiful suburban home with red bricks with a white door and a pool and a huge backyard overgrown with milkweed And goldenrod so we packed our bags and left. We were ecstatic because we currently lived in a very small one bedroom apartment with no hot water. 



When we got there it was just how we imagined it: the house was beautiful. The neighbors were mostly nice except Mr. Goodman. He was a conspiracist or so we thought he kept telling us to cut down the overgrown flowers because some kind of monster would smell it.  We thought he was joking until we heard all over the news reports of missing people and then returning the next day with no memory of what happened. 


We thought it was a hoax until Mr. Goodman disappeared late one Friday evening. We tried everything we called him, knocked on his door, called 911 with no success.Until Saturday, when we saw him planting flowers in his front yard we asked him what happened and he asked what we were talking about.We were so confused then he proceeds to tell us we should plant and water more flowers. When we got inside our house I asked my husband did he not tell us to chop ours down a few days ago? We laughed it off  then we went to sleep.



The next day I head to work and the manager tells us the company is shutting down due to many disappearances so I came home early. I was on my way home when I saw a sale at a new store for a brand of bacon that Thomas likes. So, I stop and buy some for dinner. 



I was on our street when I Saw a figure about 7 foot tall. It flew out of my window carrying something humanish I RAN inside and I couldn't find Thomas anywhere. So, I called his cell and I couldn't reach him. I got worried because he is usually home by 3:00PM. It was 7:00pm. A few minutes later I got a text from him saying “Hey babe i won’t be back until tomorrow night I have a teachers conference in Ohio” so i replied “ok love you” no response …. A few hours later there was still no response so I went to sleep.



The next day i look for a new job until he comes home and does his normal night time routine until I notice something off when we were eating dinner he requested that he go and get some flowers to sprinkle over his chicken at first I was confused so I say “have at it” so he goes and gets some and strait up eats a flower. Again, I was confused and he asked if we could cook flowers. At this point I thought I was dreaming, but I wasn't. Then when we were cleaning up after dinner ,I noticed that there was a small hole on the back of his neck and he said “oh the barber in ohio must have done that’ i said ok and we went to sleep. I wake up to the back door opening and I go to investigate. I see Thomas just shoving flowers in his mouth. I shout at Thomas , and he comes back inside and says “sorry they are just so good” then we go back to bed. 



The day went normal until bedtime. I realized something about his back. There are two long scrapes on his back. I touch them and say what the heck happened and he wouldn't tell. The next day I found a job at a coffee shop and went in for an interview. It went well until I got home. When I walked in everything was destroyed. So, I went into the backyard and all the flowers were gone. I hear something behind me. I turn to see something that looks like Thomas, but with very colorful wings and a long tongue. I asked him what happened and all of a sudden he tackled me and screamed a scream that you could barely hear. Then all the trees busted out with orange butterflies and they started to bite  me and they never stopped.

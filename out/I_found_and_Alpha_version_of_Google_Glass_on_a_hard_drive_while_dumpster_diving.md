My name is Derek, I'm a IT Consultant in the city I work in, servicing hundreds of businesses in the area over a term of 8 or 9 years. There came a point around the start of the pandemic where I was no longer making enough to live. My boss refused to give any raises, the company had put a freeze on payroll changes.

A few of our clients were a bit irresponsible with how they handled their tech, stubbornly so, and would just throw away their tech when it was time to be replaced. We also had a few tech recycling clients as well.

After a few months of skipping meals, staying in and trying to pinch every penny, I couldn't take it anymore. To supplement my income I started to go to these few irresponsible clients at night and trying to find some stuff to resell on eBay or whatever. I found some good hauls. There were servers, hard drives, projectors, a bunch of stuff that I was getting a few hundred extra bucks a week from.

Originally I just started with the clients that threw stuff away. I was making pretty decent money, but a lot of the stuff in the trash was broken, and there were some dry months. However... I **did** have a keycard to the tech recycling company, and I knew their business pretty well. Lets call this company Techcycle

Techcycle had a process for sorting though all of the junk they get. First the recycled tech comes to their warehouse, and is dropped off either in piles or boxes. Second, they sort through the stuff for reusable parts, precious metals like palladium, and stuff that can just be refurbished and resold. Lastly, they dump the rest into vats of chemicals to separate the gold connectors.

I've done an audit or two on their security back in the day. At the time, I had recommended that they have an intake inventory that is checked at every step of their recycling process to make sure employees don't steal anything. Techcycle management said they would address this, but I kind of figured it was just to get me to move on to something else.

I was right, they still didn't have an intake inventory.

This meant that I had a keycard to good tech that was probably working too. At bare minimum it would be better than a dumpster.

I sent them an email to preface my visit, simply stating that I was going to do some server maintenance. This was true, so it made a great alibi. I pulled my car into a place that I knew there was a blind spot in their camera feed and went inside.

Inside, I went to their warehouse and started shuffling through some stuff. I had some great finds! New laptops, graphics cards, a shipment from Intel that had an **entire box** of brand new processors. I loaded up my trunk to the brim, and headed home.

With resale pricing, I calculated that I probably got around $10,000 in tech that was just going to be melted down anyways. Guilt-free, right?

Through eBay I sold the stuff off, and pulled a little less than I thought at $6,000. But still not too shabby for a single day. I figured I could probably come up with excuses to visit the site at night once a month or so.

About six months went by doing this. I didn't spend the money I had on anything lavish, mostly just putting it in savings. Maybe a few years of doing this could mean I could retire early?

But this next visit would jump that timetable up significantly.

I went in for "server maintenance" again and walked through Techcycle's warehouse. It was about 8pm or so. Much past closing time, but not as late as I usually go. I was having a friend over that night to watch a horror movie together, so I wanted to finish up here quickly. Techcycle had their giant pile of discarded tech, but neatly stacked next to that was boxes marked with a single, color printed word.

>!"Google"!<

My jaw almost hit the floor. Almost hungrily I bee lined to those boxes. I cracked a few open and knew I hit the jackpot. Google treats their employees well, in those boxes I found gaming/work laptops, cracked-out servers that were brand new, enterprise networking equipment.

This was something I couldn't pass up, but I also knew that someone would notice if these boxes were gone. What I did was load all of the tech from Google into my car, but refilled the boxes with some of the nicer-looking tech from the pile. I tried to organize it in a way that it looked before. It was a risk, but I think it was worth the chance.

Back at home in my garage, looking though my haul was... awesome. I might actually have close to $100k in tech right here. But I also found something a bit more interesting.

It was a smaller box with a big red stamp on the side that states "MARKED FOR DESTRUCTION". All of the boxes had that, but this one also had the words "ALPHA" and "CONFIDENTIAL" stamped on.

I cut the tape open and was surprised to see a pair of Google Glass glasses. Now, usually these things look pretty goofy, but these ones were actually pretty close to the glasses I wore regularly. They were slick, lightweight, and low-profile. I've never used one before, but I was able to turn them on and give them a try. Over my eyes was transparent text that read "ALPHA TESTING 630682106-T-431". Seemingly some identifier for whatever developer had these.

Looking around my garage, there wasn't too much going on. I didn't know if I had to issue some commands, so I looked it up.

"Okay, Google" - - Nothing

"Hey Google" - - Nope

I didn't hear anything, there was nothing except that stupid identifier on the screen. I was starting to wonder if I had just skunked out on some tech that was used to only test one specific feature.

^(ding dong!)

Oh shit, I forgot that I was having my friend over. I started to do a half-jog before I realized I forgot my *real* glasses. I stopped for a moment and realized that, wow, these seem to be my prescription. I thought maybe it was dumb luck, or maybe that was the specific feature they were testing. Holy hell, do I have some proprietary alpha-tech from Google?

I kept the glasses on and went to invite my friend in, lets call him Drew. I opened up the door and invited him in, gave him a hug, and told him to get comfy as I got some popcorn ready. Now, Drew had lost his mom about 3 weeks ago, so I've been trying to hang out with him and make him feel better. You know, just be there with him. We've been trying to watch horror movies together at least once a week. Tonight we were going to watch Blair Witch, the newer one.

I made some popcorn and brought it over, turned on the TV and we were chilling on the couch. The movie was pretty good, but we decided to pause for a bit and go get some beer. Drew was driving, and he turned to me and said "Hey Derek, are those new glasses today?"

I said "yeah, they are! Like em?", and as I said that, I had tapped the ridge on the right lens twice to emphasize them. When I did that I heard a voice, followed by a text prompt on the screen. Reading down:

>!DREW NABLES, 27 YEARS OLD, MALE!<

>!HEIGHT: 5'11" -- WEIGHT: 232 LBS!<

>!OCCUPATION: RETAIL CLERK, STARTING DATE - 3/7/2026!<

>!INCOME: $34,727 ANNUALLY, $18,952 YTD!<

>!HEALTH CONCERNS: HIGH CHOLESTEROL, DEPRESSION!<

I was mix of frozen in fear, wondering if he could hear it, and wanting to chuckle about the height. Drew is pretty adamant about being 6ft tall. But it kept going.

>!GOALS:!< >!MAKE MORE MONEY THAN DEREK,!< >!BE HAPPIER THAN DEREK,!< >!BE MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN DEREK!<

>!CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE: NEGATIVE - PARENTAL ABUSE, BULLYING!<

>!DREAMS: HOMICIDAL, BEING ATTACKED, BEING ABUSED, SUICIDE!<

>!REGRETS: MEETING DEREK,!< >!MURDERING HIS MOTHER!<

This time not only did I freeze, but I knew my face went ghost-white. After a few seconds I was able to recompose myself, and I was trying to suss out if Drew had heard any of that.

"Are you okay Derek?" Drew had asked. I guess he did not hear any of that.

I told him that I'm feeling a bit sick, maybe from the popcorn or a stressful day at work, and called off the night.

He drove me home, and I went straight to lock all of my doors and windows. Currently sitting in my bed writing all of this out. I truly have no idea what to do now. He... ***murdered*** his mom? And now I'm also learning that he has some weird obsession with my life? I mean it's beta tech, it could be wrong. But also we all know how much info of us is out there, and we can only assume that tech giants like Google have even more than that.

Honestly I don't even know what I want to get out of this. Legal advice? Practical help? Just to get the story out there. I mean I knew that Drew was a bit troubled, but *what the fuck!*

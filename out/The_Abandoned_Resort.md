So, let me explain something first.
In my european costal town, close to the seashore there is a small forest between the main road and the shore, and in that forest is an abandoned resort.
It was last active about 35 years ago and a family member worked over there. It's now a popular place for heroin addicts and alcoholists. I remember our parents told us to never go there couse of said reasons, but my brother (who is older than me) said he went there when he was smaller and saw nothing. 

One time when i was about 11 my friends and i were just having some fun on our bikes near the resort and we just all kind of decided to go there inside the resort. It was about mid summer and maybe around 8pm so i wasn't too scared. We left our bikes near the fence. There was a locked, tall gate that was blocking our way, so we all jumped the fence at a point where it was the lowest, and there was a brick wich helped us climb over. I was the last to jump over since i am not the bravest of us all. When we got close to the door that was already ripped off i got this weird heavinnes in my chest, i sort of felt short of air. But of course i would have been the coward if i didn't get in the resort, so i hesitetly got in.

I remember there was this weird overwhellming smell of cinammon. Idk why i find that funny lol. Anyways we looked around, and we saw a snake that quickly got away and a sort of caved in roof. One of my friends (let's call him Jack for the sake of the story) said that he heard from his other friend that there was somethin creepy in the upper most floor, so we had to go up the stairs. When we got to the third floor, i knew something was wrong. We saw kind of this like big-ass bone looking thing and two mutelated chicken carcasses that had their feet and wings missing. We were all freaked out and just wanted to get out of here. Jack then looked down the hall and had the most horiffic expression on his face. He just kind of went blank.

All of a sudden, we hear the sound of some bannging, or machinery comming from the basment, then a bottle or some glass smashing coming from the other room. I remember that i was so scared i fainted. I ain't sure when i woke up, but i had several missed cals from my friends and i bolted up from the floor and sprinted as fast as i fucking could down the stairs, i almost tripped. When i got outside i vommited and climbed over that fence like fucking Sonic. My friends' bikes were gone, and i pedaled home. I never told my parents what happend.

When i was a few days after that whit the same group of my friends, Jack had told me that when he had that expression on his face that he saw a shadow-looking thing kind of look around the corner from that same room we heard the glass brake. After that, i always get chills and feel dizzy when i think of the glass breaking.

I wanted to write this here becouse of sometging that happend to me yesterday. I was returning from my music practise on my bike at like 11pm. The road that i usually take was (and still is) blocked off for construction, so i had to take the road where the resort was. I hesitated to go and contemplated taking a much loger route to avoid the resort, but i was tired so i took the road. I tried to speed past the resort, but something caught my eye. I look over at the same window that was in the room with the chicken carcasses and i see something mooving, then the creepiest, deepesst maniac laughter that you could imagine. I almost fainted, becouse i always do when i'm scared, but i held onto myself and speed home with my heart racing. I don't know what to do now, should i call the police, or was that just somebody messing with bypassers? Idk man, but i ain't going back there anytime soon, that is for sure...

Btw sorry for my bad spelling, english isn't my first language.

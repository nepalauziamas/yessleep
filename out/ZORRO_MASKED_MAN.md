This story takes place when I was a young child, I was about 6 years old, it happened in the summer of 1995. My uncle has a fairly good amount of property, he has a camper that's on his property as well.

One night during the late hours of 10 PM, he was in the house drinking with his friends from work, all were having a great time, lots of horseplay and loud voices in the house. My aunt and I were in the living room watching an episode of Xena the Princess Warrior, i remember this time so vividly. I heard one of my uncles friends shout from across the kitchen and say "DID YOU ALL SEE THAT?" suddenly all the noise and commotion of their drunken laughs stopped. My uncle immediately went into the spare room by the kitchen and got his gun. I remember my aunt gripping my arm when she also looked outside of the window. I got on top of the couch and looked as well and remember everything that followed next. Outside was a pair of glowing red eyes, it appeared to be a figure and i can only remember the figure as the entity wore a suit that looked exactly like the character Zorro, he had the same hat, and what looked to be the eye covering, and also a black cloak. I ran out of the living room and hid inside of the spare room, I looked and saw my uncle as he got his gun and ran outside with his friends following him.

I did not see what happened outside of the house but did hear a gunshot while they were outside, my uncle then came back inside with a terrified look on his face. 

He began to tell my aunt exactly what happened while outside. He stated that when him and his friends tried to go confront the thing which they thought was a person, it quickly ran away from them and went to the back of the house by the shed; my uncle then fired off his gun in the night sky. They then ran to the back of the shed and began to look for the person, they did not find anything. My uncle then said that when he went into the field by the camper he could see a red light inside of the camper. He approached the camper then the red light went away. Still, we do not know exactly what happened that night. 

Now 23 years later, I researched this online and found that, in New Mexico, there was a lot of Spaniards that dressed in this same fashion back in the 1800's. The article I was reading also said that, being there was a lot of bloodshed on the land that we lived on there assumed a lot of spirits. I told my aunt and uncle this now and they completely agree. They too think that this circumstance could have been a spirit of some sort of conquistador or horse rider. 

Since this time we have never seen anything of this sort happen, there has been a lot more creepy things on this piece of land that we call home though.

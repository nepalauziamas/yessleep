I’ve never been a big believer in superstitions, and certainly not one in the paranormal or supernatural. All those magic “magic” witchcraft stores selling blessed rocks or chakra candles seemed like nothing but scams banking off people's gullibility. So when my sister suggested stopping at a fortune teller tent we had been passing on our way back to the condo during summer vacation, I was sure we were doing nothing but making some con artists pocket a little fatter, but she was persistent with the idea til I eventually caved and agreed. I knew shit was gonna get intense the moment we stepped into the tent, and we’re greeted by the fortune teller…who called us both by our full names. 

Of course my sister was blown away by this and I’ll admit I was definitely surprised, but not in any good way. Not only have I never seen this woman before in my life, we were on the other side of the country from our home, so it’s unlikely this woman saw us around enough to memorize our faces, and even if she did, how the hell did she get our names. At first I thought maybe somehow she swiped our IDs from us, but that was disproven as well…once the lady spoke my thoughts out loud. “No Simon, I neither swiped you or Janet's Identification of any kind.” Hearing that could only leave me speechless, it was getting harder and harder for me to convince myself there was a logical explanation for all this. “If it’s more proof you need please sit, I can read you your whole past.” she said gesturing to the chairs across from us, and she did just that

She went through my entire life story with detail, including things only I knew about, or never told anyone. She even named my exact weight, height and the fact I was left handed. Once she finished reading my biography, I had no other choice than to believe this woman really did have some sort of psychic abilities. “Simon, please leave the tent for a moment, I prefer to do these readings one on one, as to avoid any judgment towards another’s future.” she said as she put on some sort of ruby amulet, in the shape of a flying bird, I think a crow. I shrugged and nodded, before leaving and waiting for my sister to finish so I may have my fortune read. about an hour or so later Janet came out of the tent giggling and bubbly. “Guess who’s gonna be a big shot on the big screen?!” she said with a confident smirk. “I laughed and rolled my eyes before lightly patting her head. “Well then you best start going to your classes when you get back to school.” I responded with a sly raise of the eyebrows before entering the tent myself, and taking a seat at the table.

“Please, let me see your hand.” she politely demanded as she stretched hers out towards me. I grabbed her hand and as I did, the amulet, along with her eyes began to glow a bright baby blue. We sat there like that for a good while, she didn’t say anything but the facial expressions she made were alarming to say the least, constantly fluctuating between worried, sad, even a little bit of fear. After maybe 45 minutes her eyes and amulet returned to normal, before she quickly recoiled her hand back and gathered her bearings. “So uhhh, what did you see?” I asked rather nervously. She looked at me with a great deal of what felt like pity, before shaking her head, clearing her throat…and revealing my future.

“You will graduates your trade school for welding, and start a business with a good friend made at your time in class. You will have 18 years of thriving business, you will marry, and have two children. on the 19th year, your national level company will crumble after your partner was caught with tax fraud and embezzlement. After this you will make your living off freelancing jobs, eventually turning to stealing from clients' homes and offices to make up for your lack of income, and while you will never be caught doing so, some of your thefts will end up severely crippling several peoples livelihoods. One night you will come home to your wife sleeping with another man, a man you end up beating to near death, landing you a 15 year in prison with the charge of aggravated assault, in which you’ll serve 7 for good behavior, now divorced and jobless. you will manage to get yourself on your feet if only barely, for 4 years, until your children get struck and killed by a car that lost control of its breaks. You will turn to heavy drug and alcohol use, and grow rather violent, serving a total of 2 years on and off due to multiple misdemeanors, and once you find out the man who hit your kids will serve no time for what he did, you will go through great lengths to find his address, go out and purchase a six round revolver, drive to his home, and shoot him twice, then his parents, and sister, before turning the gun on yourself and fatally shooting yourself in the head.” 

When she said that, I felt the whole world begin to spin, and felt as if I was gonna vomit my gut up. I could feel myself break out in a cold sweat, turning to her and asking in desperation. “Is there any way to change my future?” She looked at me somberly, before letting out a soft sigh and answering. “there is, but I am unable to tell you how, I have given you all the information i’m capable of giving, so the change in your future ultimately depends on you, but I will tell you, to change your future is extremely difficult, fate doesn’t like losing…and often never does” she said as she removed the amulet from her neck and placing it in a small wooden box. “But, I know now, I know what to avoid, so that means I know what to avoid right?” I asked in desperation. She gave me a soft smile, one that felt like more comfort than the softest bed. “That’s a big reason I started my business. While I do love seeing bright futures of fame and fortune for my clients, like your sister, I more so prefer helping those with a dark future of pain and cruelty.” 

After finishing her speech, her soft smile sank to a pity filled frown. “But as mentioned before, It is ultimately you who chooses if this future plays out, and I can promise you the answers will not be as clear cut, or easy to make as you think them to be, and even if will, you humans and your hearts are by far the hardest things to change.” She added.
That last line sent a chill down my spine, one that I don’t think could ever be recreated. “Us humans…?” I asked nervously, but even more so curiously. She nodded and gave a soft chuckle. “Come now simon, you really think a human would be capable of this? No, I've simply taken the form of something your mind can process. Seeing my real form would most likely leave your brain completely fried, and you can push all those worries of me being a demon or monster to the side. You can consider me a third party participant. I do not come from earth, hell or the heavens, but from the stars. My people and I have recently discovered you humans and just…wow some of you guys are definitely in need of some guidance, so we use our abilities to try and do just that. granted this has still been a rather strenuous task, but to the few that cross us we manage to pull through. Don’t be fooled by every shitty “psychic readings'' in an apartment building or some crummy strip mall, there’s about 6 of us all in places similar to my tent here.” she told me, rather casually mind you. As if everything she just told me was nothing more than official water cooler talk. However I was in a complete daze, it felt like I was in the strangest lucid dream, while at the same time, still being in reality.


She most likely saw my utter confusion, as she gave a deep sigh and smiled. “Look what I am isn’t important, what is important is that you know how much of a terrible person you become, no offense, and now you know how to try and fix it.” she said softly before standing up, thanking me for my business, wishing me luck on my journey to change my future, and led me to the exit of the tent. I stepped out and Janet came to my side, beginning to ask me of my future, until she saw my face. “Simon, you alright buddy.” she asked, waving her hand in front of me and snapping me out of my daze. “uh, yeah, just a lot to take in is all.” I responded, sidestepping any other question about it on the way back until she eventually gave up.

It’s been a few months since then. Janet just got accepted to NYU for acting, and for me, I don’t know what to do. I can’t just drop out of school, I’ve half way through the second semester of my third year, all the student loan debts I’ve rack up would be going right down the toilet. I’ve tried figuring out which of my friends was the future business partner to screw me over, ended up turning to a near hermit, but not too long ago, 5 of them invited me to a group chat to talk about all going into business together after graduation, and starting our own company. She never said anything about more than one partner, I don’t know if I should just avoid like the plague, or stay around and see how things play out, maybe figure out if it even has anything to do with my future. I’ve barely been able to eat, let alone sleep. It feels like every night my dreams are invaded by my possible future and all the wrong I do…I’m thinkin I get that gun earlier…turn it to myself before I get the chance to do any of it.

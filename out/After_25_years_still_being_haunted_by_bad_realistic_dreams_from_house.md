First of all, I'm not a native English speaker and no writer. So bear with me.

We all experienced nightmares/bad dreams/or some kind of "realistic" dramatic dreams etc.

But my dreams/nightmares always take place in the house I grew up. Sometimes in the beginning or middle or end or as a whole.

I was about 6 when we came to live there. The house was old and had a lot of 'bad' energy. It was build at the end of the 19th century. 1893 or something like that. I don't remember. So a lot of people lived there and a lot happened I guess. Maybe a clich√© yes.

I was a normal boy with no problems or causing any problem or having any issues. Nothing special. Just normal. I had real good hearings. And could study well. Motivated. Not nerdy. I played with my plastic green soldiers and tanks, toy cars and bicycle. Later I played soccer a lot.

After the first time I experienced the 'bad' energy I told my mother about it and she explained to me about the house being old and many people lived in it. She made a safe place for me in her room where  I could flew to when I experiencing something in the house.  When I'm scared of something in the house. When I was alone in the house, the energy of the house turned in something really creepy. Something like death that moves in. Like a mist coming up from the sea at the bottom of the mountains. You can't ignore it. It will get to you. When I think about it again, it gives me the shivers. You don't smell anything or something like that. It just want to communicate. It was really an energy. Like a bad feeling. It made you feel real bad. Then my body/guts kicked in and told me that I need to flee the area. My head got blew up like a balloon filled by the shivering/chill. I ran to the spot/room my mother had made for me. The energy didn't follow me there. The living room and my dad's study-room also. My mom was a social worker and my dad a priest.

The dreams I had where horrible. I talked in my sleep. I could talk the whole night. Realistic dreams with people surrounding me. Talking to me. No people I recognized. Also hearing noises when watching television. One night there was a big bang on the floor. My parents went to look but didn't find anything. And we didn't own something that could make that kind of sound on the first floor.

The home was not all the time a horrible place. It was most of the time a nice beautiful peaceful house to live in. I grew up there, yeah on some days or moments there was something strange about it. And I think I'm still carrying that feeling with me.

My parents took me to the doctor when I was young and had also some tests and talking with people. Nothing abnormal.

The other strange thing I experienced about 10 years ago was on a day I drove by the house just to see my old place. The people who lives there back then, changed the color of the front door in to red-brown-orange. When I passed the house and looked in my interior mirror, I was confused; I saw the same deep-green door in the mirror like we had back then. I stopped and drove back. Of course the door had the color mentioned earlier. I never went back again. But from that day I had again a lot of those dreams. Real bad horrific dreams I can't really describe. Strange psychedelic things. I'm awake and seeing stuff happening but I'm in a dream in the same house. It has all kind of subjugates/subjects. People I don't know, people I know from the past. Sometimes my mother. My dad  not anymore.

The house seems to be still hunting me. I need to stop thinking about it. Sometimes it can also tell me stuff. My mother passed 5 years ago and the house told me. I had a horrible dream of my mother in the coffin. Just like how it happened a few days later when she really passed away.

Ok, a little bit longer than I thought in the beginning when I started this. I need to stop now.

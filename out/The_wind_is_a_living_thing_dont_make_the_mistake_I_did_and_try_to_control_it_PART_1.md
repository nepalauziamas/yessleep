Children are a special thing, we often see the world with open, unjudging eyes. We often don’t see danger where others may be wary or cautious. I made that mistake as a child, and now my life is constantly in danger. The wind isn’t just….a thing relating to temperatures or the spin of the earth. It’s alive, and as far as I can tell is capable of emotions, including jealousy and hatred. Do not try to control the wind. You see I was fascinated by the wind. I loved to watch the sky on a windy day and see the different directions the wind took the clouds. The noise of it careening across a field, or through the woods always made me smile. I had thought at one point, on a particularly windy day I could ‘control’ the wind with my arm motions and make it gust to or fro. This was years before that Avatar show aired on Nickelodeon. What I did seemed to work, and I had thought I made a connection with this base element of life. How wrong I was. 

Let me explain, in the early 00’s as a child around ten, I had a really nice Schwinn bike. I loved to take it around my cul-de-sac, and as I got more adventurous, and my parents loosened the leash I started to explore. There weren’t any big, wooded areas right behind my house, so I had to bike a good distance to find those. Up the street, take a right, then a left at the gas station. This led to this tiny strip mall with all of 4 storefronts, a place that sold Gyros, I think a hair salon and the other two didn’t matter. If you followed around back of this standalone building, the road continued.

This road curved slightly then went steeply down into the woods. A winding road where if you weren’t careful on a bike you’d pick up some dangerous speed. The wind blasting you in the face as you screeched the brakes, to lean into the next turn while you flew down this hill. Before you knew it you were at a small parking lot, that was adjacent to a series of tiny ponds you could fish at. On either side left and right you could explore a bike path that went deep into the midwestern woods. 

On one particularly nice fall afternoon I found myself there, looking around at the trees clad in faded greens, yellows, and some early browns. There were dead leaves already rustling around the asphalt, making that distinct hollow scratching sound as they were dragged about by the whim of the winds. It was familiar, there were a few parked cars, some lazy people in pop up loungers fishing with 2 or 3 rods.

The wind picked up and blasted to my left, almost nudging me to bike on the left side trail today. I decided to oblige if for no other reason than a tail wind made it easier to bike. Off I went, the parking lot fading as the black asphalt of the bike trail became the only path forward. The trees swayed and shook as the wind stumbled back to life in occasional gusts, followed by periods of a calm constant stream through the air. I had coined the term “Winds of change” a few years ago cause these winds were the end of summer and heading ever forward to the frigid midwestern winters. 

After ten or fifteen minutes of biking, all the while the crunch of dead leaves drummed beneath the skinny tires of my bike, I saw something peculiar. Well, mundane in most circumstances but out in the middle of the woods you didn’t see this crop up. It was a little leaf tornado, swirling near a few trees, not 10 feet off the path. 

Like most of its brethren I’d seen before it seemed to stir to life when the wind began picking up, and then came to a brief tall crescendo maybe 5 feet high during the gusts. I watched with rapt fascination, slowing and stopping to watch this Having seen these around corners of buildings, in the woods it felt…out of place. It didn’t seemingly stop even when the wind had ceased its forceful gusts for seconds or even minuets at a time. A few dozen leaves seemingly refusing to stop swirling near the base. I don’t know what came over me but I called out to it, and make a swirling motion with my fingers as if to stir it up further. 

This seemed to work, the whipping circling mass sprung back up, I laughed a bit at my perceived control of this force of nature. I walked little closer and picked up some dead twigs, throwing them into the swirling mass. It seemed unperturbed and died down once more. After the wind seemingly revived this whirl, I had a bad idea, as children often do. I picked up a softball sized rock and hucked it as hard as I could into the whirling mass. 

Another gust shot past, ruffling my already ragged hair, and the whirl sprung back to life, seemingly sustaining for longer than I had ever seen before. I was awestruck as it seemingly spun in place, leaves whipping about in concentric circles, the brown and yellow leaves scratching at each other and the ground around the base.  It was then I noticed the quiet, the crows cawing had stopped, the wind was dead flat the tree’s swaying and shaking had abruptly stopped.  There was nothing, just the eerie scraping of dead leaves against each other and my own breathing. What happened next should be impossible, my kid brain wasn’t possibly seeing things right. The whirl of leaves seemed to lean forward, the base gliding along the ground picking up new debris as it did so, inches became feet and the strength of the wind started to buffet my jacket and face.  For the briefest moment, frozen in time comprised almost entirely of leaves and empty space what appeared to be a malformed face. I heard an unnatural hissing echo from what I thought could be a mouth.

I screamed, and flipped my bike one-eighty and ran, hopping mid stride and began peddling as fast as I could. The wind screamed to life out of nowhere and I was fighting the strongest headwind I’d ever felt. I didn’t look back at whatever that whirling monster was, but I didn’t hear it following, though it would be hard to hear anything when the wind is piercing your ears as you ride as fast as you can into it. I managed to climb back up this ridiculously steep winding road back out of the woods and into safety. Panting, lungs on fire as I coasted to a stop and got off my bike. My lunch from school ended up in the gutter from exertion and terror I’m sure. I wiped my mouth, and biked home. 

I thought that would be the end of it, some children’s hallucinated terror about the leaves. I didn’t have any weird nightmares, everything seemed fine. It, whatever ‘it’ was, is gone. That was, until a week later after school got out for the day. I went outside and unlocked my bike, walking it through the parking lot. The rest of the kids were mostly gone, a few loitering waiting on late parents, or going to the back to play in the playground. I noticed it, in the corner of two walls, another leaf tornado. My heart skipped a beat, but after the wind quieted for several moments the leaves settled. Nothing happened, I watched and waited, before the wind picked up again. This time the little whirl of scraping leaves seemed to focus in on itself, the spinning growing tighter and faster, more uniform. I felt the hairs on the back of my neck spring up and I decided to book it home then and there. 

For weeks everything returned to normal. I went to school, I played with my friends, and I completely forgot about the “leaf tornado” that was coming after me. I spotted some natural whirls, but they never did anything weird. Soon September turned into late October, and we were approaching Halloween. Being the Midwest, storms are far from uncommon, ‘sever thunderstorms’ could even be considered commonplace. Whipping winds, sheets of rain, maybe the occasional tornado warning siren spooling up. These storms entranced me as much as the wind itself. 

One evening we got that blaring SAME headers for a severe thunderstorm warning. I was in my room with my TV on, it had been raining and thundering some that night, but continued to grow in intensity. Turning the TV off, and then my light to better see outside I went to my front window and just watched. The rain pelted against the screen and glass of my view into the outside world. Flashes of lightning cloud to cloud, kept the sky looking alive. Though I did look down, and I noticed something in the street, among the two rivers of rainwater headed to the storm drain at the intersection of our road, it was almost cone shaped. A few flashes of lightning told me all I needed to know. It was back, and it was following me. It didn’t seem any larger, it wasn’t flying towards the house, but this unnatural whirl of storm debris was sitting in the middle of our storm soaked street, the noise of the debris it picked up scraping off the road and against itself. 

I ran to my bed, threw the covers over my head and waited it out. Through out the night when the wind would pick up in a violent gust, I swear I could hear an oddly consistent rustling and banging of twigs and debris against my window. It kept me up most of the night, but sleep did eventually envelope me. There weren’t any tornadoes in the area that night, and our house didn’t suffer any peculiar damage more than our neighbors. In the back of my mind I knew it, whatever this thing was, was out there, waiting for me and it wasn’t leaving me alone. 


Things only escalated as I grew into an adult, and now I don’t feel safe any time the wind blows, I must subdue a panic attack if there is a storm predicted in my area. I have a hard time renting, so I ended up living the ‘van life’ as they call it. Now I try to do the opposite of storm chasers, I run, and it? It follows.

A dead body has been found and surprisingly it was found on my way home .I am a police officer and I am in charge of this case . The corpse height was similar to mine near 5/9 The whole body was burned making it unrecogniseble. Everything was unknown about it. No name no contact no relation with anyone no face . This body was found in an  abandoned house. What was this person doing there? 

Rumors have been that the owner of this house suscide  burning himself due to some mental health. is past repeating itself?my subordinate Jackie came to me and wishper in a small voice that whoever went to that abandoned house got poses by the evil spirit and forced the victim to burn themselves to death. I got gussbom s but in this Morden days who believes in these things like spirit and ghost. 

I gave Jackie a unbelieved look and scold him saying you shouldn't believe in this shorts of things and rather should focus on case because we didn't had any clue nor we know was that really a suscide or a MURDER .(day2) we investigate in nebhour and nobody had any idea there was a burning person there should had been the voice of pain from that person before dying but nobody heard it. Because it was far from the living place. It was found by a child while they were playing cricket. 

The ball went to the abonden house by mistake.he is in truma now. According to a medical report the body was there for around 1/2 days which means it hasn't been long since that person die.The more I think about this case the less I know about it. 1 week has passed now still no updates about this case. When I think about when I enter that abonden house it still gives me chills and creapy vibes. The thing which shocked me most was there were some footprints but only at the crime scene that footprint neither enter through door nor left it .

 At that moment my best friend called me . he was busy for the  past 10 years so we had a lot to catch up with he was a famous scientist and we were friends since school. He told me to come meet him asap at his office. I thought something happened so I rushed in there but it was nothing much he just wanted to tell me something he invented. I was curious about it because it took him his 10 years of life a decade without an outer word touch I can't imagine how hard it can be. 

He was so happy he said " Samir I finally did it I finally made a time machine which will be one of the greatest inventions in the history I was schocked surprised and happy for him the most at the same time I hugged him and congratulate him it was his dream to make a time machine since his childhood.we talked a lot about how our life is going on and I tell him about the case I was working on which haven't let me sleep for past few days.he also became curious about it .

 I jokingly said Didn't you make a time machine what if we go back to 1 week past and see what happened maybe we can help that person too. He said ok let's go with a serious face.i smile awkwardly and said "hey I was just jocking maybe this restless night has got me .but he Wanted to do something adventures that we didn't did in decades what can be more thriller then a time travel. He convinced me after a while.

 They say curiosity kills a man. I agree because the time machine had been tested and it was 100 percent accurate . It was just time to reveal the public. It was already night only we two were there . We get in timemachine and set the destination and time and our journey to the past began . To my disbelief we were actually on that abandoned house 8days in the past I still couldn't believe my eyes . 

Before I did something to check if it was true my best friend warned me to not touch anything or we may have a different future or it could be worse . I thought he was joking but he was dead serious . So we didn't touch anything and waited for something to happen but nothing happened at all we got tired of waiting. 

The sun was about to rise and I suggest going back to the future because we may have entered the wrong day . My best friend agreed he was too tired  because of the timemachine project . 

My friend entered the machine and was managing some system and I was about to enter when I tried to open the door I suddenly got electriczied my whole body was overflowing with electricity and I could feel everything like my whole body and I feel like my skin was being trun apart at that moment I just wished to be dead instead. My buddy there tried to turn it off but it wasn't responding and it suddenly vanished. at that moment I got the update about the case I was investigating the body was not burned  it was electriczied.

Back in probably 2017 I was in high school, living like I was invincible of course. I smoked my fair share of the weeds prior to this. Also, I smoked this stuff prior to this little nightmare as well and felt nothing off. But this night, what me and my friends experienced is something we haven’t had happen again nor do we want it to happen again. I guess we became the stoners of the horror movies. I’ve told this story countless times to people the same way, this time I will do the same.
A group of us were invited over to a friends house for at little party. We get there and we weren’t allowed to really smoke so 3 of us went to a local creek we regularly came to during the day. We parked in the neighborhood next to houses but to get to the creek you have to cross an open field. So we do, hit the tree line next to a paved path, and descended down and over to the other side. We light up, enjoy ourselves, talk shit, you know how it is, and get about halfway through. 
This is when it all started getting creepy. On the other side of the creek from where we came from, I heard leaves and bushes moving, like an animal was moving around. I thought nothing of it as we were in a wooded area, but it still caught my ears’ attention. My friends heard it too and we commented on it, but as we kept smoking the rustling was becoming noticeably intermittent and loud. Then the sounds of a moving bike not being peddled started. 
Our nerves settled down a bit, it was probably just a biker out for a very very late ride. So we still stayed and tried to forget about it, but the rustling came back and now was right on the waterline across from us. Keep in mind we can’t see a damn thing out here. At this point it could have been a person. So, we call it and throw a quarter of the blunt in the water and walk back. 
The feeling of walking back was eerie, not wanting to be the last one, checking all directions. It felt like we weren’t the only ones there. We went up the hill, came out of the treeline, and walked back towards the cars. We felt safer and just as we hit the center of the field I saw it. 
On the treeline, about 50 yards left from where we exited, was this incredibly tall, white, almost see through human like figure hauling ass across the treeline. And I don’t just mean hauling ass, I mean this thing would move 10 ft right then dart back 5 ft then move another 10ft right. It literally made no sense. Even describing it still doesn’t seem real. There wasn’t leg movements or anything, my head couldn’t make out what I was looking at. Like you see ghost and apparitions in movies but this thing just straight up was unnatural. So I ask my friend in front of me if he see it, he goes “what the fuck is that thing” and our third buddy sees us staring this thing down and goes “fuck no let’s run”. 
We all collectively darted towards our cars, I mean I didn’t care if the others didn’t make it type of run. We raced out of that neighborhood and all met back at the party. Imagine coming back home after seeing some horrific shit to just your family chilling having a good time. That what this felt like, we walked into a party of smiling teens oblivious to what we saw. Some saw our weird behavior so asked us, we explained and most just ignored us but some continued to ask us about it. 
We told the story a lot that week at school and on and off at seshes for the remainder of living in our hometown, but it just kinda became lost in all the bullshit of growing up. We are now all in college in separate states but someone brings it up every once in awhile to me to tell the story again. I guess all we can do is just laugh it off because of how crazy it sounds and look forward to telling a scary story to our kids in the future. To this day, the best explanation I have is it was just a reflection of light from a moving door on the treeline from the houses behind us, if you can imagine what that looks like. This is the one experience in my life where I’ve wondered if there actually is an explanation for everything supernatural. This is a true story, I’m a dude in his 20s about to graduate college, not some horror story writer.

Last Month, My wife and I had gotten a home after almost a year of looking and making several offers that we were outbid on, despite offering well over asking price (seriously, the market is brutal right now).  Anyways, we got this house under strange circumstances.  First, we actually underbid on it by quite a bit under asking price.  And we've been overbidding and getting outbid, so we were sure we were not getting this, since even with the underbid, it was right at the edge of our budget.  We also requested the seller help with the down payment with 3% (can't remember the term for that), since some stuff needed fixed in the house and they actually agreed.  Then, since we had an FHA loan, we had to have an inspection that needed certain things fixed before we could use it to purchase the house.  And they fixed everything on the list withing a few days instead of calling it off.  I couldn't figure out why they agreed to all of this when it was clearly a seller's market, but we got the house.

&#x200B;

We moved in, and there are weird noises and the basement reminds me of the end of the Blair Witch Project, but i figured it is an old house, it is bound to have creaky floorboards and the creepy stone wall basement.   However, every now and again, things feel...weird.  

I've kept busy on my days off fixing things and updating things around the house, as like i said, it is old and needs some work.  The task i did the other day was fixing the bedroom carpet.  It was laid down and never made tight. so it had big creases sticking up that were mild trip hazards.  I got out my tools, and peeled back the corner to  begin rolling it back up, so i can make it tighter, then just trim off the excess after i secure it to the ground again.  At least that was what I planned to do.  I did not expect to find the beat up, dusty leather journal under the carpet.  

Of course i read it.  I'm mildly creeped out by the contents, which I will share with you here.  I marked this as NSFW as the author seems to enjoy swearing at times.

  April 5th - April 6th, 2020

I’ve never done a journal before, and my psychiatrist says it would be great for me, as I have been dealing with depression and this whole situation isn’t helping, between the depressing news, and not being able to go out and simply do anything to take my mind off of things for a while. Video games and Netflix only help so much, and the drugs they prescribed also only lessen the edge of my constant existential dread. 

Anyways, what did I do today? Well, I slept most of the day away, as I used to work third shift, so I am basically nocturnal for the most part. I woke up to the Wife working at home, she hates being stuck at home all the time too. It is nice we get to see each other a bit more, but there is only so much you can do as far as activities and engaging with one another in an apartment. 

I cooked some beer braised beef stew in my dutch oven. Took about three hours and I made waaaaay too much, but hey, meals later in the week, am I right?

I played a bit of Resident Evil 3’s remake. It isn’t bad, and Nemesis is as intimidating as I remember him from the Playstation days for a couple hours afterward while the wife showered and watched some videos on youtube. She went to bed around 1 am, and I stayed up, switching over to Monster Hunter for a few hours.

It is about 5 am, on the 6th, and I’m getting tired, I have got to go and run errands tomorrow, as the laundry needs done, and the groceries need replenished. I think this is what my doctor wants to see on my next visit, whenever that happens to be, so peace out.

April 6th-7th, 2020

So, I started out my day at about two in the afternoon, Woke up and greeted my wife, grabbed some breakfast, just a simple bowl of cereal, and used the last of the milk. No biggie, as I was going to go shopping in a couple hours. I washed the dishes and grabbed the baskets of laundry, kissed my wife before leaving, I noticed she was watching the news, something seemed odd about the news report, but I figured it was my still waking up mind just letting my imagination go a bit, I shrugged and headed out. 

On the back porch by where we park our cars, I saw the little stray cat me and the wife feed, we named him Pipsqueak (Pip for short), because he was tiny when he first started visiting, and he doesn’t really meow, he squeaks. He was begging for food, like usual with his squeaks, so I popped back in and grabbed a can of the puree we get for him and put it in his bowl. 

Our neighbor was on the front porch and we exchanged greetings as I got into my car to head to my first stop, the laundromat. It was pretty empty, despite being in the center square of town, then again, not many people are out and about these days. I was thrilled the big washers were open and tossed our laundry in them along with some tide pods and read The Last Wish from the Witcher series as I waited for the washers to finish, then tossed the laundry into the dryer and continued reading. Folded it all up to the best of my ability, I’ll admit here that I am nowhere near as good as my wife in this regard.

I stopped by the apartment to drop off the laundry to make room for groceries. My wife was in the bathroom, so I told her I was heading to the grocery store and if she needed anything to text me or call while I’m out. Told her I loved her and noticed the news was on still on the TV, it was the same anchors on, despite me being down at the laundromat for nearly an hour and a half. I thought it was strange as most news was half hour to an hour long, but I shrugged and headed out.

The grocery store had more people in it, a few were wearing masks. It wasn’t required yet in our state, but I figured it would happen soon. I got the things we needed replenished on, and a few things to make dinner on the grill. I love grilling, especially charcoal. I feel every man should know how to grill, it is good for the soul. 

I got home, and the wife was playing some internet game, she helped me put away the groceries and I prepped some kebobs and headed out to fire up the grill with all the supplies in hand, and noticed the same anchors on the news again, I hadn’t paid attention to what they were saying all day, but figured they were just rerunning the same stuff from earlier, like highlights, and I just happened to walk by each time by sheer coincidence. I grilled up a delicious dinner and we ate, then sat back and did some planning for a party we are having in a few months, and discussed what we needed for around the house. 

Once again, she went to bed before me and I played a few hours of a game to wind down.

I’m writing this at about 4:30 in the morning, and I’m heading to bed.

April 7th-April 8th, 2020

I got woken up by sirens and loud banging and footsteps in the neighbor’s overhead apartment, roughly 12:30, when this all happened, so I was a little groggy. I asked the Wife if she knew anything, and she didn’t know. I put on my pants and an old t-shirt and headed out to speak with one of the police outside. Long story short, the neighbor died at some point between yesterday and today. It is strange, because I had just exchanged pleasantries with him yesterday and he looked fine, besides being somewhat old. I told the officers as much

Some paramedics in biohazard suits brought out a stretcher with a body bag on it. And there was a crying lady in what I think would be about the age to be his daughter, roughly in her 40’s.  I guess she stopped in and found him dead. 

So, that was a bit of a shock. I went back in and told the wife, the news was on again, and it was the same channel as yesterday, same anchors, and this time I noticed they were only talking about coronavirus deaths. I’m kind f getting tired of hearing about it, somehow this damn virus has invaded every aspect of our lives, like a relative that drops in, and just won’t leave. Anyways, my wife took it mostly in stride. We played some Cards Against Humanity, and heated up some of the stew around dinner time. I turned on the tv, and they were rerunning that crap about the virus again, so I changed the channel, same anchors, same story. I was puzzled for a second, then clicked again, and got Travel channel, just in time for Ghost Adventures. I honestly think they fake a lot of their evidence, but I watch it just for their overreactions to absolutely everything.

I decided to hit the hay at the same time as the Wife tonight, writing this out as she takes her turn to prep for bed in the bathroom, and it looks like I timed this just right.

April 14th-April 15th

Sorry, I missed a few days. Been doing pretty much the same things as I been doing since this all started, mostly household chores, and a few errands here and there as needed, since we are under lockdown, which is seriously dragging on me and the wife. I hope this ends soon.

The greatest tragedy is, all the Chinese restaurants I have tried to go to are all closed. I am craving some Lo Mein and some egg rolls. I can really use a MSG fix. I miss Chinese food. I hope this insanity ends soon so I can have some delicious teriyaki chicken.

Anyways, today, the cops stopped by and asked me a bunch of questions about the neighbor, mostly basic stuff. I never really knew much about him other than he lived upstairs, seemed friendly enough, and drank a ton of Budweiser, judging from the cans in the recycling bin every week.  They also asked if I was alright, as it turns out he died of the virus.  The cops were…a little off. They smelled a bit like burned plastic and didn’t seem entirely normal in their behavior. It is hard to explain, but their speech patterns were off somehow, and their body language didn’t seem entirely normal. I could just be letting my boredom get the best of me though, and letting the imagination run with stuff that isn’t entirely there. I want to tell myself that, but I swear as they walked back to their cruiser in their slightly not right walk, I saw one of them grab their radio and I swear I heard them say “Subject 2314-C still responding, increase exposure.” I want to believe I was just hearing things, and I want to believe it wasn’t about me, but it seemed really strange. And increase exposure of what? I don’t notice anything different to the start of this mess, so I can just be getting paranoid. 

Anyways, after pondering that, I did a supply run to the local store. I got lucky and got the last bulk package of toilet paper. That is one thing I will never understand, the sudden hoarding of toilet paper, it is a respiratory illness, it isn’t likely to give you the screaming squits. I can understand the cleaning supplies being pretty much ransacked though. Also, eggs are ridiculously priced…1 dozen for $3.69?! That is insane. I got some for my wife anyways, as she loves eggs, but still…

Got home and the news was on again, and on more channels, still talking about corona virus deaths. I have noticed They never seem to change their clothes, must be a set they wear just for filming or something, like how some tv characters are always in the same clothes it seems. I didn’t pay much attention, Me and my wife played a rousing game of monopoly, Cthulhu Edition, where I lost because she had all the railroads and the dice decided I should keep hitting them. We then watched some of an anime I have on dvd that she had never seen, and went to bed.

I forgot to write this initially, then I got woken up and realized my wife wasn’t in bed with me, so I went to check up on her. She said she just isn’t tired yet and I should get to sleep. I’m concerned, so I am waiting up a bit longer for her and writing this out as I lay in bed waiting on her.

April 17th – 18th, 2020

Yeah, I know I missed another day. I’m losing track of time since every day is pretty much the same routine almost with slight variations. However, a couple of weird things happened today. I woke up around Noon, grabbed a bite to eat, and got ready to head out, as I had to get groceries. It rained last night, and pretty much everything was wet outside, except the bit of the porch close to the wall, as it is under a patio. Pip was there for food, so I ducked back inside and got him a can of food and gave him a few pets on the back. That is when I noticed, right outside the bedroom window, the bedroom is right on the other side of the wall from the porch, a set of wet footprints, bare foot, and oddly shaped. My wife has small feet, and mine are a bit on the wide side, so it wasn’t any of ours. I was a bit baffled. I double checked the window. It was still locked and had no signs of tampering, but still…. 

I headed to the store and even more people were wearing masks, I tried to keep out of the six foot range from everyone, so I don’t have any problems with anyone. I already don’t like people, but lately, they have been a whole new level of asinine. Letting their fears get the better of them. Anyways, I got some basics and some ice cream, since my wife wanted some. 

The weird part is when I got home, I swear I saw someone looking at me from my neighbor’s window as I pulled in. I called the landlord, wondering if he had been up there, but got no answer, so I called the cops, despite my uncertainty about my last encounter with them in regards to my neighbor. I just assumed I was just overthinking things and called them. They got here in just a couple minutes. They still seemed unnatural, in that slightly off way I mentioned earlier. I still cannot put my finger on it. 

They checked the apartment and found nobody, they told me to let them know if I see anyone again. I told them I would, I doubt I will, they are unsettling, their presence makes my hairs all stand up, and I actually have no problem with police, but these two officers, I cannot figure it out. It also doesn’t help that I swear I heard the one radio in “Subject 2314-C still responding, increase exposure.” As they were getting into their cruiser again. I could dismiss it once, but hearing the same thing twice is a little unnerving. 

I tore the apartment apart trying to find anything that could be out of place after that, I also checked al the vents and heaters and even the water, and it all looks normal, tastes normal, I could just be letting my relative isolation be getting to me, but damn, I hope this all ends soon.

Late afternoon, I go out to get the mail, and notice a package from Amazon for my wife, it is heavy, like it is books. I’m still a bit concerned for her, she hasn’t been sleeping much the past few days. I gave her the package hoping its contents will improve her mood. I left her to it and went outside to fire up the charcoal grill to make some burgers for dinner.

I gave her a dose of that sleep aid medicine NyQuil came out with around 10:00 pm to help her get a few hours of sleep. I had gotten it at the store to help her. I honestly think it is the stress of the whole situation getting to her. I hoped she would sleep through the night. 

I woke up at about 3:00 am to thudding sounds coming from the dead neighbor’s apartment directly over our bedroom. I rolled over to ask my wife if she heard it too, she was not there. I guess the sleep medicine failed. I crawled out of bed to go check on her and maybe use the restroom while I was at it. I found her, looking so very tired, at her desk in the office, with the Amazon box open, it was full of new age spell books and she was feverishly paging through one of them. I asked if she was ok, and I clearly startled her. She insists she has it under control. I doubt it, but I left her to her devices, she can be rather…stubborn at times. Hopefully she gets better, if not, I do not know, I hope it doesn’t come to that bridge.

I decided to head outside quick to grab my charge cable from my car, as I noticed my phone was close to dead. I couldn’t help but glance at the windows upstairs since I heard thumping up there earlier. And son of a bitch, there was someone watching me, it was my dead neighbor. I froze dead in my tracks and stared him straight in the eyes for what seemed like forever. He didn’t move or even seem to breathe, he just stared straight at me. I managed to regain my composure and I bolted inside the apartment and pushed a chair in front of the door under the knob. I was sweating and out of breath, and shaking. 

I finally manages to calm down enough to write this. I’m going to try and get more sleep.

April 18th-19th, 2020

What the hell?! I tried watching some tv, after last night to see if there was any news on, and see if there was anything about when the quarantines would end. I made a baffling discovery. The same news anchors from before are on, in the same clothes, and talking about coronavirus deaths. Here are the kickers: IT IS ON EVERY GODDAMN CHANNEL! I don’t understand. Are they having difficulties at Comcast? I tried calling them, but am not getting any answers and the machine tells me to call back later. That does make me think they are booked with similar calls, so everybody is calling to complain. I also noticed it is a loop of the same report playing over and over again. They must have some serious signal issues or something. I hope that is what it is.

My wife is looking rough from several days of little sleep. I had to venture out and try and find masks for us to wear, since tomorrow, it is going to be mandatory to pretty much go anywhere. I asked if she needed anything when I was out, and she told me that she ordered what she needed, so I should just focus on masks. I asked if she wanted to come with, but he declined. She decided to pour over those tomes instead.

I had seen Pip before I went out the door today, and took a can with me to feed him. I stopped short however, because it was completely dry out today, and it only took maybe twenty seconds to get the can of cat food, and there were now two sets of wet bare footprints outside the bedroom window, they were different sizes, and there were no other prints on the porch leading up to the window. Pip seemed to be staring at something. I hopped off the porch, giving the prints a wide berth and gave the cat his food, then got out of there, thoroughly weirded out. I really hope it was a kid trying to be funny.

Of course, nowhere had any masks, or any sort of face covering. I ordered some online, and grumbled at the fact it would be a few weeks until arrival. For all I knew, this could all be over by then. I decided to grab a few things at the store we were short on, to look like I hadn’t completely failed in my outing when I got home.

Inside the little grocery store almost everyone had masks on, despite the mandatory wearing of them started tomorrow. I accidentally got within six feet of someone and they just screamed at me. It wasn’t normal. It was primal, and loud, like a gorilla getting ready to tear something apart, except this came from a 90 something pound lady. Needless to say, it caught me off guard, and I jumped and nearly crapped myself. After the initial surprise got me, I apologized, but she kept going, nobody wearing masks reacted at all, but anyone not wearing one all looked wondering what was going on. I just decided to back up, as she was getting hoarse at this point, and the second I got more than six feet away from her, she stopped and carried on like nothing happened. Me and a few people who were not wearing masks looked at each other like “WTF was that”? I just simply shrugged, and went to grab my gallon of milk from the cooler, when I heard another scream from down the aisle, one of the other non-mask wearing guys got too close to an elderly man this time. It was very strange as pretty much the same thing happened. I decided to get the hell out of there then and there, got in the only unoccupied line and got out of there.

When I got home, I felt something was off. I looked up and the upstairs apartment windows, and there was my dead neighbor again. After the grocery store, and the prints on the porch, I was done for the day and just gave that bastard the finger and grabbed my shit and went it, put the stuff away and retreated to my bedroom for a while. I didn’t even look to see if there were any prints on the porch still, I was just done caring.

After a while, I came out to use the restroom and to get a drink and to check up on my wife, who was paging through those books still, and now she was taking notes. I asked if I could get anything for her, and she turned me away, I told her she should eat something and that I’d make some dinner, so I got to work on dinner. I took her some and she barely ate. I am really starting to worry. I would like to take her to a doctor to get checked, but I’m sure doctor’s offices are booked solid for a while. I tried talking with her, and she seemed annoyed that I’d bother her, though she was trying to humor me for the first half hour. Eventually, I took the hint and gave up. I turned on the TV, and it was still those same damn anchors in the same damn clothes repeating the same few minutes of dialogue about coronavirus deaths. On EVERY FREAKING CHANNEL STILL!

I gave up, read a bit of a book I’ve had laying around, and now I’m writing this before I go to bed. It has to end soon.

April 19th-20th, 2020

They are making us mandatorily wear masks on top of all the other crap we have to put up with. Of course, I had no luck finding any still, so I am wearing a bandana like I’m some sort of train robber everywhere I go. 

People still scream if you get within six feet of them, and I still see the neighbor watching me from his window when I exit the house. I still give him the finger to see if I can get a reaction out of him. Nothing, I might try mooning him next time? Not like anyone is going to see me do it, barely anyone ventures outside, and when they do, it is for basic needs or work. 

The damn footprints keep multiplying on the porch…those kids are damn dedicated to a bad prank. Pip now absolutely refuses to come up on the porch, as now the footprints now cover almost the whole of it, all in the direction of the bedroom window. I gotta say, these kids are really dedicated to their shitty prank. If I ever catch them…

I have tried calling Comcast several times in the past few days about the “glitch” with the constant replaying of the same news broadcast on every goddamn channel. And every time, they deny there being any issue. I swear these people are gas lighting me. If they don’t fix the issue soon, I’m looking into getting a satellite dish. I’ve had about enough of this crap. At least I have Hulu, Prime video and Netflix until I can figure out how to get a dish installed.

I have been dosing my wife with sleep aids still, as she can’t seem to stay asleep for more than a few hours at a time even with them. Last night, I caught her in her office with candles and a circle of salt on the ground chanting. I didn’t disturb her as I was thoroughly weirded out. I’m going to have to address it with her soon. I’m not looking forward to that one.

The police stopped by again today, checking up on us and asking the same questions about our neighbor. They also reminded us we need masks to go anywhere now. They still smell strange and still seem off. I’m getting used to it at this point, and I don’t like that I am, especially since I heard one of them radio in once again “Subject 2314-C still responding, increase exposure.” As he was getting into his car. I tried calling out to them to get an explanation, but they slammed their doors and pulled out like they had someplace to be. I’m not sure if they are screwing with me, or what, but I am definitely hearing it, as I hear the same exact thing each time.

I got contacted by an old friend of mine, Sam. He said I need to download Zoom and get in on some meetings to talk to other people. I might take him up on the offer, but I really didn’t like those sort of video call programs. Maybe I can get my wife to hit up some of her friends. I think it would do her some good to have some sort of interaction with others besides just me. Maybe it will do something for her sleep issues and her depression from being stuck inside all the time.

Anyways, I’m gonna have to get my prescription filled tomorrow, so I should head to bed. I really don’t want to deal with screaming people again.

April 20th-21st, 2020

I caught my wife chanting and seemingly trying to perform witchcraft this morning. I confronted her this time, and she told me she was trying to keep us safe with her spells, and that she spent several days researching how to do them just right. My concern grew exponentially at this. I might have to look online or call a doctor for advice on this.

I took her with me to the store to get my prescription. She was resistant to this idea at first, but relented. She did not seem to notice the every growing number of wet bare foot prints on the porch all facing the window, or Jack staring down at us from above as he always does, in his ceaseless gaze. I got her into the car, and quickly flipped my dead neighbor the bird, as has become a ritual to me at this point.

I had called ahead so my prescription could be filled at the pharmacy by the time we got there, it was a relatively short line, and there were not many people out today. I asked my wife if there was anything in particular she wanted me to cook for dinner. As I could grab the ingredients while we were here, she settled on Tacos, which is great, because we have most of the stuff at home already, and they are delicious, and easy to make. As we were looking for tortillas of the size we wanted, I noticed the people in the store with us were a little…off. They seemed like they were in a trance, their eyes were staring into wherever, and looked almost mannequin like, cold, and empty. However, my wife wandered within six feet of one lady, and the lady let out this hellish, banshee like wail. My wife and I jumped in the sudden frightfulness of it. My wife couldn’t move, as she was so scared. The woman wailed herself hoarse, and I could see flecks of blood soaking through her mask, as she continued. I grabbed my wife’s hand and pulled her out of the aisle. As soon as we were out of the six foot radius, the woman went back to being practically lifeless as if nothing had happened. My wife had been freaking out at this point, her social anxiety was getting the best of her. I gave her the keys and told her to wait in the car, and I’ll finish getting dinner.

I went out to the car, and she was doing a bit better. I snagged us both sodas at the checkout counter, and handed her one, and popped open the other, and opened my prescription to take my daily medication…the pills were different. The bottle was labeled what I got, but the pills are completely different than they always looked. My pills were tiny red pills normally, these things were huge and green. I checked the markings on the pill online, and they said they were the same medication, so I took one and I am awaiting to see if it affects me in any adverse way.

We got home and I set her up with some of her friends on Zoom to talk. I didn’t even look up at the neighbor’s window as I brought in the groceries, but I was sure he was still there, ever watching me. Stubborn, dead bastard, just accept it already. I also noticed there were still more footprints on the porch, and still no sign of Pip. I checked his usual hangouts near the house, and he was nowhere to be found. I hope a big bird didn’t decide to eat him.

I made dinner and smiled as my wife was sounding better than she had in a while as she was discussing things with some old friends via Zoom. As we ate, I watched and noticed something odd. Some of her friends kept scratching at themselves, like they had an itch. Over the course of the few hours she was talking to them, it went from light scratches like an itch occasionally, to constant clawing at their flesh, like there was something under the skin. Nobody else reacted to this at all, not even acknowledged, even the ones clawing away. I’m wondering what is under their flesh to cause them to claw like that.

After that, Me and the wife decide to watch Letterkenny on Hulu, since she loved that show. We hit a snag, and I’m both irked, and a bit freaked out by this. Every episode of every show, and every single movie was replaced by the damn news story that has been playing for who knows how long now. I checked Netflix, and Prime video, which are showing the same results. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?! I decided to put in a dvd and we watched that, trying to hide my panic for my wife’s sake. I gave her some sleep aid and she went to bed. I am writing this and will soon follow. 

Hopefully getting out and interacting with others helped her a bit.

April 21st-22nd, 2020

Woke up to my wife chanting and trying to cast “spells” again this morning. I guess yesterday had no real positive effect on her. I just let it go for the time being and tried to get ahold of the doctor. Line was busy. I figured as much, since everyone and their uncle are panicking over this damn disease. I tried looking online. Half of the webpages I come across are giving me 404 errors, the other half are telling me to seek a medical professional or psychiatrist. I tried calling both at multiple offices in the area in our insurance network…all busy. Ugh. I just need a small win, why can’t I get a small win?

I talked to her, and convinced her we were well protected right now and she should try and get more sleep. I gave her some more sleep aid to get her to take a few more hours of much needed rest. 

While she was in bed, I drove to the local doctor’s office after getting the address and put it on my navigating app. There was a massive line around the building of people looking like they did yesterday, except they looked more lifeless, more fake. They all stood what looked to be exactly six feet apart. I was creeped out, but rolled down my car window enough to ask if they knew when the doctor would be available. They didn’t even acknowledge me. Like they really were a bunch of mannequins standing there. I couldn’t even recognize any of them, many looked almost the same with the exception of clothing. Failing to get a doctor, I decided to head home before my wife woke back up. 

The neighbor was still staring down at me, I figured what the hell? And looked around, there was nobody around, I dropped my pants and mooned him while giving him the finger between my legs. Not very adult, but he still didn’t react at all. I hiked up my pants and spat on the porch full of the ever growing number of footprints outside the window. I was beginning to doubt it was a prank by some local kids. I’ve never taken a prank this far for so long…than again, I’ve never had this much free time.

I had trouble getting my bandana off. It felt like it was glued to my face, but after a bit of tugging, and some pulled out beard hairs, I got it off. I wonder if I got anything sticky on it and hadn’t noticed. It went into the dirty laundry basket and I fished another out of my sock drawer.

I prepared some grilled cheese with cream of tomato soup for lunch, since it is yummy, quick, and easy. I made extra in case my wife woke up from the smell wafting through the apartment. I got a bowl of soup and a sandwich and sat down at the dinner table, mouth watering in anticipation of the meal to come. I cut my sandwich in half and dipped a corner in the soup and bit down. 

Nothing.

I could feel the warmth of the soup and the textures, but there was no flavor. No tomato, no basil, no butter, or cheese…nothing. I spat that mouthful out, thinking it had gone bad and double checked the dates on all the packaging. It was all well within expiration. I sniffed carefully at the soup and sandwich, nothing smelled off about them. I shrugged and dipped again…and nothing. I spat it out and wen to the fridge and tried a pickle out of a jar, nothing. I tried the black iced coffee, nothing. Out of desperation, I went to the cabinet and got out the reaper pepper powder, and stuck a teaspoon in it and then stuck the teaspoon in my mouth, expecting to suffer in pain, but there was nothing. I had lost my ability to taste it would seem. 

My wife came into the kitchen and saw I had made an extra grilled cheese and had some soup left and helped herself, thanking me for making lunch. She looked a little better from her few hours of napping. I kept the lack of taste to myself for the time being, as I went to my laptop and tried finding anything to what losing my taste might be. I got nothing but 404 errors or gibberish. Hopefully it is something I can sleep off, since it would seem I cannot see a doctor anytime soon by the looks of it.

I couldn’t taste any of dinner either, and I intentionally overspiced my portion to try and get any stimulation out of my tongue. I’m seriously worried about this. Hopefully I can get ahold of the doctor tomorrow.

I drugged my wife again to get her to sleep, as she still had serious bags and discoloration under her eyes from lack of sleep. I know I shouldn’t be doing this, but I can’t get ahold of any doctors whatsoever. I’m running out of options quick, and growing desperate to help her.

I decided to watch a movie as I type this out, to also help me ease my mind for bed. I have a glass Plantation 5 year rum on the rocks I’m sipping on, and tasting nothing still as I type. 

YOU HAVE GOT TO BE FUCKING KIDDING ME! I tried watching the Boondock Saints for the hundredth or so time, and all the disc has on it is that goddamn news report, over and over again. The trailers and dvd specials are also just that report. It isn’t just that disc either! I tried about twenty more dvds at random, and even some bluray discs, and they ALL have that damn report on it! How the fucking hell is this possible?!

I’m losing my shit. I’m trying to be strong for my wife’s sake, but holy fucking hell, stuff is beginning to be far more than I can handle. What the hell is going on?!

I’m going to dose myself to sleep tonight, and then I’m going to hope like hell this is just a bad dream, or that stuff will be better tomorrow or whatever. I need some sort of win. Holy shit, do I need a win of some sort.

April 27th-28th 2020

I have had a terrible last few days. I have not written in here, as I have been forcing myself to sleep with copious amounts of alcohol and sleep medicine, So I am falling asleep well before I can finish an entry. 

This is probably going to be my last entry. I have been experiencing the same strange phenomena I have been since this has begun. Something is far from alright in my small community. I don’t know if it is the result of an experiment gone wrong. Even Worse, an experiment gone right. Or if this is happening everywhere. I just hope someone finds this journal, and heed the warning it holds. Something very unnatural has happened here. 

My Neighbor still watches from the window, I don’t even bother flipping him the bird anymore. 

My lack of taste has escalated to my tongue falling out the other day, and as of today, my mask will not come off my face. I’m probably going to starve to death. I tried everything I could think of to get it off, but it is literally fused to my skin somehow. Before I realized this, I tried ripping at it with pliers, using rubbing alcohol to dissolve any glue, using stronger solvents, resulting in chemical burns, and even trying to hit it with the kitchen torch, but the fabric does not relent.

I have stopped drugging my wife to sleep, it has lost all effect on her as of two nights ago. She hasn’t slept since and she just keeps trying to cast spells in the office. I have failed her.

I tried contacting the doctors any way possible, still nothing. The people in the streets look to be fake and plastic. However, if you still get within six feet of them, they will scream themselves raw in the throat.

That motherfucking news story has invaded not only my video game discs now, but also my books, which have transcripts of the damn thing in. It has even invaded my dreams, which is part of why I’ve been getting blackout drunk.

The Cops stopped by just a minute ago and I noticed they still smelled of burned plastic far stronger than normal, and they seemed fake all around. I didn’t say anything to them, it wouldn’t make a difference, I just zoned out, waiting for them to leave. I overheard them say “Subject 2314-C no longer responds, move to next phase” I didn’t even care anymore, I’m not going to be here much longer.

The footprints outside the bedroom window are so numerous, they cover the whole porch, and go well out into the yard, where they show up as grass smashed down in the shape of feet all aimed directly at the window. Like they want me to open it. 

I’m at the end of my rope, and have no idea what to do as of this point, I am way in over my head, and the situation keeps deteriorating. I hope whoever is responsible for this gets what is coming to them…

…I’m going to open the window, I feel a calling to do it, it has been there and it is overwhelmingly strong now. If anyone finds my wife, and if she is still with us, please take care of her. I’m going to go see what the things outside my window have to say.

So, yeah, no clue what to make of this.   I had looked up the records of how often the house had been bought and sold, as they were included in my paperwork when i got the house, and nobody has had it for more than a couple of months for a couple years now... Now that you read that, I mentioned things being weird at times.  I feel like I am being watched in my backyard and there is a shadow in the neighbor's window when i look around.  Also, I occasionally spot footprints on my back patio facing the bedroom window... But that's just a creepy coincidence, right?  It has to be the neighbors screwing with me as a joke from the previous owners, right?  The constant changing of hands just has to be from people having a hard time with the economy in the past few years, I hope.

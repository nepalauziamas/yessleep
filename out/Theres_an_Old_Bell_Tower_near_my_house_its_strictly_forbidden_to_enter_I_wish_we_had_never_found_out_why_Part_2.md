Part 2.

'Danny, I need to tell you something!' Brian sounded panicked, speaking frantically before the phone was even at my ear.

'Do you hear them?' He said after a short pause.

I listened but I couldn't bring myself to speak, I was frozen, the bells clanged and chimed their song far away in the distance, but the sound reverberated around my head, it made me feel faint, dizzy.

'Danny are you there?'

'Its the bells!' I said at last, finally able to push words from my mouth, 'I hear them Brian'.

'I need to tell you something, something Shawn told me... I, I didn't believe him at first, that's why I stormed off, I though he was just being a...'

'I know Brian', I interrupted, 'he told me too, I didn't want to believe it either, but that's where we always thought he ended up. You didn't tell Shawn about what happened to us in there did you!?' I asked.

Brian scoffed, 'of course I didn't, I haven't told anyone!' He sounded annoyed at me for questioning his loyalty.

'Okay, I didn't think you did, I just wanted to be sure'. 

I dropped the phone slightly from my ear.

The bells stopped.

'What do we do? Do we go back? I mean if he is in there then... we really should go back and see if we can find him, I can't live with the guilt anymore Brian, we know he was trapped in there and we never went back'.

Brian hit back, sounding pissed off before I could say anything else, 'people searched the bell tower Danny, Liam wasn't there, there's nothing for us to feel guilty about, He ran away!'.

I stood at my bedroom window, pondering his words for a minute, I still felt guilty, even if he didn't, sure, we were just kids, and sure, we would have probably been killed if we went back that night, but at the end of the day, Liam was gone and I really felt like that was our burden to carry.

We were all supposed to make it out together, and one of us got left behind.

'Danny?' I heard Brian from the other end of the line after a long silence.

'Brian look, before you say anything else, I think we need to go back, what if, somehow, Liam's still in there? what if there's any way possible we can get him back, we're not kids anymore, if there's even the slightest chance we can get our friend back home, I think we should be taking it!' I heard Brian breathing heavily as I spoke.

'Danny, that place fucked us up, maybe not you since you're so desperate to go back, but that night has ruined my fucking life', Brian was sobbing and sniffing as he spoke.

'We owe it to him Brian, we always said we would stick together no matter what, we need to go back'. I wasn't taking no for an answer.

'Fuck sake! I... I suppose you're right Danny, I just.... I don't know'.
He paused for a few moments and then continued, 'meet us tomorrow at 12, if we are going, we're taking the guys with us, and we're going during the day, meet us at the park near the abandoned houses'.

'No problem, I'll be there', I replied.

Brian hung up.

I lay back down in bed.

Images of that night littered my thoughts, I struggled to get back to sleep.

.

I felt dazed and horrible the next morning, like I was hungover somehow.

I got myself ready and sat thinking of what I should bring with me. 

I took a rucksack and put some things in, a few large kitchen knives, a hammer, a big torch with extra batteries and I took a lighter with a can of hairspray, I remembered the paper on fire being a relatively effective tool, I felt like a makeshift flamethrower was somewhat upping our game.

I met Brian who was already with Shawn and Ash, they were sitting on a small grassy patch next to the road, we were just waiting on Dennis with the car.

With all the pleasantries out the way, we had to get down to it and tell everyone about the bell tower.

Dennis arrived shortly after I did and I let Brian take the lead on the story.

I could see in everyone's faces that they thought we were full of shit, I sat thinking to myself 'just wait until you're inside'.

Shawn laughed, therefore Ash and Dennis copied him but I really feel like they had to force their laughter, I think there was as least some doubt woven into their minds, which was a good thing, we were all going in, and we had to be prepared to expect the worst.

We got out of the car and made the short trek through the woods.

As I saw the looming bell tower come into view through the trees I shuddered.

Shawn and Ash were messing around and laughing at something, but I couldn't focus, I was already on edge, my mind was already in that tower.

As we approached the fence, Brian pulled out a pair of bolt cutters.

'Good thinking' I said, patting him on the back.

Within a minute or so, He had cut a long slit in the fence, more than enough to part the fence and easily climb through.

And just like that... we were back.

Looking up to the arches like we did when we were kids and had no idea what we were getting into.

I felt like I was 13 again, I felt scared but I also felt determined, determined to prove myself, determined to get my friend back and not let this place haunt my dreams anymore.

Before I could say anything, Shawn was putting his boot into the wooden door.

It began to splinter and crack, and eventually burst open.

'Simple as that', he chuckled, and walked inside without hesitation.

I felt like I could actually see the stale air rushing out from the tower as the sulfuric smell that was all too familiar to me, met my nose and took me right back to 5 years ago.

I looked at Brian, he didn't seem too sure about going in, we let Dennis and Ash head in first.

Not wanting to let anyone out of my sight, I quickly hurried in behind them, and Brian followed suit.

Dennis cautiously shuffled along the floor that was strewn with rubble and wood, dead birds and a mutilated fox lay heaped in a corner attracting hundreds of flies.

'It smells like fucking assholes in here', Ash piped up! 

'If that smell comes from your asshole man, I'd go and see a doctor asap!' Shawn fired back.

They all laughed, all but myself and Brian who just stood looking up the center at the stairs and landings that snaked the wall all the way up.

Dennis was already climbing the first set of stairs.

'Wait!' Brian called to him, 'we all go together, nobody splits up!'.

Dennis rolled his eyes. 'Right, well hurry up then I want to get back home for dinner'.

I shook my head, these guys have no clue what could be waiting for us up those stairs.

We all milled around checking the rooms before heading in single file to the stairs.

As it was around midday, it wasn't too dark, light spilled in through the doorway, the few windows that weren't boarded up and through cracks in the wood of those that were boarded up

Dennis was already half way up waiting so began to walk as we caught up to him.

One thing I didn't even think about was bringing a ladder to reach the second floor.

I would have kicked myself for being such an idiot.

I would have... if Liam's ladder wasn't already set up perfectly right at the stairs.

Brian and I looked at each other, then he stepped to go forward.

I put my hand on his chest. 'Wait', I said.

The ladder being there made me feel uneasy.

'Why is that even there?' I asked.

'Maybe Liam's Dad set it up when they were looking for him?' Brian suggested.

'And his Dad, or better yet, his Uncle never thought to question why his ladder was here?' I looked up and down.

'What's the hold up? Why are you two freaking out about a fucking ladder?' Shawn spoke loud, shaking his head.

'We're just wondering why it's there, or how it got there!' Brian sounded annoyed, I was annoyed too.

'Who cares why it's there' he turned and gestured to the ladder, 'it's there, so we should use it!'. Shawn then turned back to us, 'or maybe it's there because William has been using it to get up and down the stairs, you ever think of that?'

'It's Liam you fucking...' I attempted to chastise Shawn but he had already turned and started climbing the ladder.

I looked at Brian and shook my head, 'we never should have brought him' I said as I walked away.

Shawn had reached the top of the ladder and started climbing onto the remaining portion of the stairs.

Before he was even off the ladder Dennis had begun climbing.

I stood next to Ash.

'What's the deal with this ladder then? I'm confused' he asked in his soft voice.

'It's just another part of the story' I told him, 'it was Liam's uncle's ladder but when they searched here they said there found nothing noteworthy, then we get here and it's set up nicely at the stairs waiting on us!?', 'it just gives me a bad feeling'.

'I can see why' he said, he patted my back and nodded his head towards the ladder, 'on you go Danny, I'll get Brian'.

Ash turned and went to fetch Brian who looked upset and was standing stationary a few feet away.

I stood at the bottom of the Ladder waiting for them to come over, then one by one, we climbed up and onto the crumbling stairs.

As we ascended the old stone, I could literally feel the air getting thicker, the smell of rot and damp fouled my nose.

Shawn and Dennis led the way, they were up front joking about stuff and laughing like little girls, I couldn't really hear what they were saying.

Suddenly Shawn blurted out loud 'William! Are you up here, come out come out wherever you are!' 

How difficult is it to remember one simple name? I was beginning to think he was calling Liam by William deliberately out of pure disrespect.

'It's Liam!' Brian corrected him.

'Ooooo sorry' Shawn jested, Dennis sniggered at his sarcasm.

'Liam!' Shawn called out again. 'Where are you Liam!?' He was elongating his name, acting stupid, like it was funny.

As we approached the 2nd floor landing.

I could hear something, it sounded faded as if it were in the distance.

It was humming, like someone humming a tune.

The tune was vaguely familiar.

Nobody else seemed to notice, everybody continued as if nothing was out of the ordinary.

We made our way into the middle of the landing, I spent a few minutes looking at the door where I first heard the whisper that night 5 years ago, it was still shut.

Dennis kicked the door opposite and it swung open. 

The smell of death rushed out to greet us and we slowly entered.

I remembered this room, the same pile of dead birds lay in the corner, now nothing more than a pile of bones and matted black feathers.

A creaking sound from outside grabbed my attention. 

I turned, but again nobody seemed phased.

The humming started again. 

'What was that tune?' I thought as I racked my brain.

Everyone was talking over each other and I struggled to get a word in, all the while the humming was getting noticeably louder.

'Ehh, does nobody else hear that?, can everybody shut up for a second and listen?'.

They all stopped.

The humming continued.

I could see eyes widening as we all quietly counted in our heads and confirmed to ourselves that all five of us were in this room, and there was music coming from somewhere.

'What is it? I've heard that before, somewhere!' Brian said, keeping his voice low.

The humming grew a little louder once more.

We stood absolutely frozen still, and we listened.

The humming appeared to sound like it was echoing down a long corridor from another room, growing very gradually louder.

Every one of us were dead silent, too frightened to move.

The humming continued.

After about 10 or 20 seconds it broke into a soft singing voice.

'What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.' The voice sang

My jaw dropped almost to floor as I turned to Brian. 
He was the same, his mouth hung open and his wide eyes began to well up. 
'Its not...' I began and shook my head.
Brian nodded.

'Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mm, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.' The voice, it felt almost forgotten yet so familiar it made my hairs stand up and my gut wrench.

'It's Liam' Brian whispered, 'that's that song he...' Brian never got to finish his sentence.

The door slammed shut with such force we all jumped back, Shawn laughed nervously, 'right enough's enough, I'm getting out of here!'.

He stormed over to the door and pulled it open, Ash and Dennis were right behind him.

I could already see the darkness for myself, the tide had turned, the air had changed and we weren't alone anymore.

'Oh my God!' Ash exclaimed as Shawn stood trembling, still holding the door handle.

I ran over, Brian never moved.

Directly across the landing, the door was now open, I could see into that room for the first time.

Liam sat on the floor, a dim candle sat flickering in front of him cast dancing shadows, distorting his face.

'Hey... Danny!' He whispered.

I looked into his glowing yellow serpentine eyes and shivered.

He slowly lifted his finger to his mouth and smiled.

'Shhhhhh'.

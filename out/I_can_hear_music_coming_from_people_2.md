I have never been good with crowds. The music that comes from them are usually a jumbled mess. It doesn't often make sense. They pierce through one another and drown out the really lovely ones. It's why I generally avoid places where people gather.

I do find comfort in hearing the music coming from groups of friends. Especially the ones that aren't talking to each other at all, only walking together. Their sounds mesh and flow rather nicely. There's a cohesion.

I like the groups that talk and laugh too, they remind me of jazz. But there are times when the music from a group of friends don't come together at all, and I wonder why they're even friends. It seems so stressing like pulled cords.

Which reminds me of why I like being alone sometimes. All I hear are seashells. The insides of them, the sound of them, even the noise they make when they're being placed on top of one another. It makes me blow bubbles in the bath.

But what I hate the most are cemeteries.

I hate walking by them, or near them, I even hate thinking about times when I had to be in them. The first time I went to a cemetery was when my grandpa died. He sounded like gunpowder in fireworks. I could tell him anything, it's like screaming secrets alongside a piccolo pete during the Fourth of July.

But the day he died, there were no fireworks. What I could hear were my mother's tears. Her usual thrum and thumbing of warm drums resonated into deep hummed strokes, each hand reaching into the sky and falling flat on its face.

It's why I can't tell her about the cymbal man. That he sits outside my window, watching me sleep. His sound clatters to the floor as if something dropped. And my heart races as if I did something wrong. He smiles a wiry grin that twists as barbed wire on a fence. I wonder if he can hear me or if he see's something that I don't.

I first met him at the abandoned lot in our neighborhood, when I dropped my backpack. And then he followed me home. I haven't told my mom, because her sound has only recently returned to normal. Her steady march falls down with unbothered arch now, and I would like to keep it that way. I suppose that is why I went by myself to visit my grandpa, to see his grave.

I plug my ears when I first walk through the wrought iron gates, but it is of no use. The sounds I hear go deeper than my ear. So all I can do is run. Run and listen for the fireworks in the sun until they're visible even beneath the bright light. That is when I stop and I know that I am here with grandpa.

The thing about sounds is that some linger, there is a reverberation I believe, an echo that I can take with me. It's almost like an energy. And that is what I came here for today, to take some of grandpa home. Though the further away that I walk, the less I can hear it. By the time that I get home it's only a tremble, but the timbre is there. And I know it is him.

When I get back, it is nearly dark. I run up to my room and find it completely cleaned. I had left lines of salt on my windowsill. And beneath my closet door. But they have been vacuumed away. The sock of coins I had stored, I can now hear in the wash.

I wanted to yell and scream, go to my mom and tell her how I needed all of these things, but I can't. Her sound just returned to normal. At dinner I am very afraid of what is to come, so I eat quietly. My brother's pans bang and roll, while my dog Sally's tail orchestrates for scraps beneath the table. I feed her a piece of my chicken, a big piece, in case I never get to see her again. Sally I meant, not my brother.

And after dinner I wash up and go to my room. I had searched the cupboards earlier but only found a handful of salt left at the bottom of the container. I had used too much. Still I put what was left of it in my pocket and ran to my room.

Some time in the night I am woken up, there's a crash and a bang. I sit straight and stiff in my bed. But I didn't need to strain my ears. I look outside my window and see it crawling there. Its skin is uneven, almost like a wisp, dark clouds without rain only meant to blotch the sun. It looks at me and its eyes are pitch, it feels like I am falling. Its face burning in dark flames as live wire dances into my ears. I am scared so I throw the handful of salt at it, but all that does is hit the window. I could almost see it laugh at my stupidity.

I fumble my hands across the frame, trying to gather as much as I have spilled. Somehow my hand nudges the window and a crack appears beneath it. I rush to shut it from the top but the thing beats me to it. I can see its fingers flattening beneath the gap and curling inside. I try to run to my bed and hide but by the time I turned around it grabbed me.

Fireworks.

I can hear them shooting in the air. How it doesn't wake up anyone I have no idea. But the fireworks pop and stream. I can see the monster recoil as if struck. It bites the air as it sneers. It lashes out, its arm growing in length at the sounds.

Boom. Boom. boom. boo.

The echoes wane but the monster is still here. It grabs me by the face, I can see its claws sinking into my skin. I go to scream but it opens its mouth and swallows my cry. I try again but I can't breathe. I think I start to black out. I can see it teetering above me, its head dancing on a swing.

I feel something building in my head, it's shaking me alive. It's one last familiar BOOM that sends the creature roaring, clutching its face as it lunges out the window. I rush to shut it, shaking in my night gown, I look outside, but the creature is gone.

In the morning I leave the house before school starts. I go by the graveyard, plugging my ears as I run through, but I get lost. It takes me awhile to find it, before I can stand in front of grandpa's grave. Because there are no fireworks. No sounds. Not really. I unplug my ears and listen. None of the usual pains I hear in a cemetery. Almost nothing at all.

I look around and there is nothing there, where once I heard music coming from people, now only the cymbal is clear.

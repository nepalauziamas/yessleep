Consider this to be my confession. I failed at parenting even though I tried so hard. 

Since my wife passed away it was only me and baby girl Rose. Yes, we’ve been through some hard times: junk food rented apartments, rats, and roaches around. 

&#x200B;

But somehow I managed to stand on my two and things went better. I treated her as the most important person in my life. Anything she wanted - I was there to provide. Dollhouses, dresses, sweets, and puppies - anything she asked for.

&#x200B;

But things started to change as the teen years began. Rose became gloomy and depressive, avoiding me, and ignoring my questions.

&#x200B;

I tried to figure it out. I did. Hundreds of times I tried to sit down and talk to her, asking what was wrong and what I could do to improve her life. She sat across the room, not even looking at me. As if I was an empty spot, producing noise that annoyed her. 

&#x200B;

My friends said that it’s ok. It’s just a phase and she’ll be alright. But I, as a father, couldn’t just leave it like that. I decided to act and gave her everything I thought would make her happy: the largest flatscreen I could find, the latest phone model, expensive make-up and clothes. She left everything unpacked. The boxes were moved to the corner of her room, untouched. 

&#x200B;

That got right in the feelings. It couldn’t continue like that, so I decided to switch my approach. 

&#x200B;

“Young lady, you’re getting grounded. No sweets, no phone, no nothing. I won’t accept such behavior under my roof. Have some respect for your father!” - I said to her one day. 

&#x200B;

She argued with me, and we shouted at each other for an hour or so. Some shots were fired.

&#x200B;

She said that she never asked to be born in the first place. I said that she is not making my life easier. She called me a monster, I called her ungrateful. I didn’t think straight, that’s my mistake, I agree. 

&#x200B;

We didn’t speak to each other for a week. I just kept doing what I had to - providing a roof and hot food for the ignorant child she was. 

&#x200B;

Soon enough her mood changed and she started to ask: “Can I go outside and see other girls, please?”.

&#x200B;

But I made a second mistake and decided to push further to prove my point and discipline her: “No, Rose. You’re grounded. And you know why, don’t you?”.

&#x200B;

She was furious. She screamed at me saying that she hates me and her life. I shouted back stating that it’s the best she can have while she lives here, so she’d better deal with that.  Our battle continued. 

&#x200B;

Her 16th birthday was coming up and I was looking forward to it. I hoped that this date would take all the negativity away and on this special day - we’ll understand each other.

&#x200B;

Rose was not as excited as I was. Three days to it she threw a plate at me, repeating how she hates me as I walked into her room. She said that she would rather be dead than continue living like this. 

I was in grief… My own child. Words like that hit harder than bullets. I wish nobody experienced that ever. 

Hormones are turning our kids into monsters. And we were never taught how to deal with monsters. 

&#x200B;

But the day has come and my heart was full of hope for her Sweet 16. I picked up the present from the closet and went to her room. The beautiful white dress. Her mother always wanted to see her wearing it. 

&#x200B;

“Rose, honey! Are you awake already” - I asked opening the door. My voice trembling, as I was about to present her the family heirloom. 

&#x200B;

The package fell out of my hands and hit the ground. I didn’t even realize that until later. Tears flooded instantly and my whole being collapsed into a single dot of despair, pity, and sorrow.

&#x200B;

There she was - lying on her bed, breathless. Blood covering the sheets dried already. I couldn’t imagine this in the most horrible nightmare. My baby, my flesh and blood decided to end it all in such a gruesome way. And I did everything for her. EVERYTHING!

&#x200B;

All the dolls, all the gadgets, all the kind words, and support. I even decorated her shackles with Hello Kitty stickers, just as she asked.  What am I going to do now?

&#x200B;

And as I stood there, in the middle of the basement a thought I kept avoiding became too intense. 

&#x200B;

The sacrifice should have been made today, and my Lamb betrayed me, even though we had a deal… What do I do? I don’t think He will be satisfied with my excuses and explanations and would expect me to take her place. I am a coward to take my life, but thoughts of other options fill me with a primal fear. I think He’ll be coming for me tonight…

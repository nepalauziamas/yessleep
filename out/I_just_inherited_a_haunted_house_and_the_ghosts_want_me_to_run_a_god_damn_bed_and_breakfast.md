Mmmmm.

Morning wood, am I right?

I had reached for my crotch to get a little wake-me-up zazz going when I realized that something felt… off.

I opened my eyes.

[I was in the bedroom I’d inherited, but everything was wrong](https://redd.it/hmsf9j). The mattress had been moved to the other side of the room with me still in it, providing a full view of the cavernous space. Bare, sooty footprints led from the fireplace to where the mattress had originally been. Those prints then turned and proceeded to my mattress’s current location before pacing the room, heading to the corner, proceeding ten feet up the wall, coming back down, and stopping again by my bed. 

There, they simply disappeared, as though their owners had never left. 

Even more bizarre was the fact that the footprints transitioned in size. They started looking like adult treads, then slowly proceeded to the shape of a small child before growing larger again as they paced. They were over two feet long by the time they reached my bedside. 

The hair on my neck slowly rose. I wanted to cry.

But the ‘no rent’ thing limited my options to ‘stay here.’ That’s it. My list of options was just the one option.

So that’s why I live in a haunted house. I simply can’t afford a better neighborhood.

“Okay, pal, this is how it’s gonna be?” I asked groggily as I tumbled out of bed. “Do you really think I’m above pissing in your precious fireplace? Because surprise: I’m not.”

I should have considered the smell before I started, but I’m not usually running on all five cylinders before that first scoop of mayonnaise. 

“Now the fireplace is muddy ash. Remember that next time you put your bare feet in it.” I zipped up and headed out of the room. “This is *my* house now, and we’re living by *my* rules.”

That’s how I learned not to piss off haunted house.

“I’ve got a question for you,” I asked the man in the black trench coat on my front porch. “How did I know you were at the door? I didn’t hear a bell, but I knew you were there.”

Mr. Advocatus smiled that not-so-friendly smile. “I’m not here to tell you how the house communicates with those held inside.” He opened his omnipresent briefcase and pulled out a sheet of paper. “Your Great Aunt Mary has some requests for you.”

“Ok, what the hell?” I asked, taking the paper that I knew I would regret taking. “Why didn’t you just give me all the bad news at once yesterday?”

“Because you might not have taken the house,” he responded casually.

“Well – yes, that’s – there’s a distinct possibility you might be very right.”

He was silent.

“You know I had a strange-ass night last night, don’t you?”

He was silent.

I sighed. “Okay, what does my dead Great Aunt Mary want me to do with this God-forsaken place?” I asked as I looked over the paper. 

“A select clientele will find their way to you. Your job is to extract a fair payment.”

I raised an eyebrow. “That’s it?”

“Too good to be true, right?” he responded brightly. “Oh, and wear a different pair of pants when your guest arrives.”

I looked down.

God *damn* morning wood.

*

I spent the day trying to build a new routine. No longer my place of residence, the Corolla was now exclusively used for commuting to campus in town, where most of my classmates lived in the Bowdoin dorms. It was odd going into classrooms that were smaller than my new bedroom; I had no idea how to explain the situation, so I told people I was camping by the river, because that was less weird than the truth. Besides, I didn’t want them asking to come over when my strange-ass houseguest was scheduled to show up. 

I mean, sure, I could have chosen not to let this houseguest in. But since I’d opened up a ‘urine’ front in the war against my mansion, I didn’t want to break any more rules than I had to at the moment.

And when I found myself at the front door – again with no idea how I knew someone was waiting for me – the guy looked kind of okay.

Sure, he was kind of scuzzy. Basically, he seemed like a guy who’d never changed his freshman year hygiene habits as he aged into his forties. 

“Raymond Salach?” he asked from behind strands of greasy hair.

“That’s me,” I answered, checking to make sure that I was wearing a pair of respectable jeans. “So, um – who are you, now?”

“Call me ‘Eagal,’” he responded with a gravelly voice. “You cool if I drink in the backyard?” he asked while holding up a six-pack of Cedar Mountain Ice.

My eyes grew wide. “Where’d you find that? It’s the only beer I’ve ever seen that sells for less than four bucks a twelve pack. You can drink wherever you want if you’re willing to share.”

Anyway, that’s how I found out I have a backyard. It’s gigantic and heads right down into the Androscoggin River.

It’s where Eagal showed me his pills.

“It’s a win-win, my friend,” he cooed unpleasantly. “You scout the girls. Freshmen will drink anything, and you don’t need much Rohypnol to get the job done.” He crushed his beer can, belched, then threw the trash at a bush, which he missed. Then he slid me a crisp hundred-dollar bill. “That’s an advance. I’ll pay for each girl you convince to meet me outside. He smiled, and I could see that he was missing several teeth. “I’ll take care of the rest.”

I’m not proud of what I did. But I had a giant mansion with no food inside. What options did I have?

I took the money.

Eagal clapped a hand on my shoulder and pulled me close as we made our way back into the house. His breath smelled of cheap beer and regret. “Raymond Salach,” he slurred, “I’ve got the ability to make you a very rich man.” He slurped up a bubble of drool. “Where’m I sleeping?”

What the *fuck*, Advocatus? Why did he set me up with this douchnozzle?

*A select clientele will find their way to you. Your job is to extract a fair payment.*

What possible reason could I have had for being in the eye of this shitstorm? I wondered this as we staggered through a kitchen that was equipped with more appliances than I knew how to use.

There had to be a mixup somewhere down the line. I hadn’t even read the list of rules. 

I stopped.

A thought had crossed my mind, but I didn’t like it. Still, there was no other apparent way to unite Advocatus’s advice with the list of rules and this creeper who would be sleeping in my home. 

Was it the right call? I turned around to evaluate the guy. 

Eagal was pissing on my fridge.

That’s when I remembered more of Advocatus’s advice.

*“Follow the rules. Things may surprise you.”*

“Oh, I get it house. This is revenge for the fireplace, isn’t it?” I asked, completely pissed.

“Wha?” Eagal responded as he drunkenly stumbled, soiling a long stretch of wall and floor.

“I said pack your pecker back in port. I’m taking you up to your damn room.”

*

I’d intentionally avoided the third floor hallway up to this point. The pressure increased as I slowly proceeded along it, like I was swimming ever deeper under water. 

Eagal didn’t seem to notice. 

The door at the end of the hall was open just a crack; a soft blue glow emitted from within. 

I didn’t want to open the door. 

But, like every other survival instinct I’d had in the past two days, I ignored it.

Nausea seeped through my pores as I stepped into the room. I kept my eyes glued to the wooden planks of the floor.

“Here’s your room. I have to go. Do you need anything?”

I didn’t know or care if the room had a bed, or furniture, or anything at all. I just wanted out of there. It smelled wrong, and bizarre memories floated back with incredibly twisted details.

Eagal stood next to me and remained silent. 

I went quietly into the hall and closed the door behind me.

I’m not proud of what I did. But I had a giant mansion with no food inside. What options did I have?

I had taken his money while intending to screw him over.

Whether or not the house shared my intentions was his problem now.

*

I really didn’t want to go back into my extra haunted room in search of the creepiest man I’d ever met. But when Eagal hadn’t emerged by the next night, it became clear that I needed to head into the blue room in search of him.

The hallway filled my ears with the same pressure as I approached. My eyes were tearing up by the time I reached the doorknob. 

It was unlocked.

I kept my eyes pointed at the floor as I stepped into the room. I didn’t like waving my arms in front of me – but the thought of *seeing* was more terrifying than the notion of *feeling,* so I reached into the shadows.

The air pressure in the room changed significantly as I stepped forward. It felt like I was outside; no echos or reverberations matched my steps.

And I was cold. 

My arm brushed up against a man, and I nearly voided my bowels.

Assuming it was Eagal, I grabbed him and pulled forward. He followed stiltily, like he was unsure of how to use his knees. 

The door was farther away than I had remembered.

Once we were back in the hallway, I shut the latch and finally raised my head to see if the correct strange man was by my side.

My tightening throat stifled the scream.

Eagal’s hair had gone sheet-white and was now pointing straight out in every direction. I think that he was staring at me, but I had no way of knowing.

The pupils and irises had disappeared from his eyes. Only wide globs [stared back at me](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

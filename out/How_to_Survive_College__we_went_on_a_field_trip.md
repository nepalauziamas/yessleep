[I signed up to stay for the summer semester.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wiq9p9/how_to_survive_college_the_devil_gave_me_a_pencil/) I didn’t think I’d be able to on account of deadlines and all, but it turns out the university is really lenient when it comes to things that involve students giving them more money.  I’m going to use it as a way to get caught up since I started in the spring semester instead of the fall.  By the time the summer is over, I’ll be officially a sophomore and back on track.

Just need to figure out what I’m going to actually major in.

Mom sounded disappointed, but she didn’t argue.  I think she’s trying to support me now, as best as she can.

That would change in a hurry if she knew what was going on.

The real reason I’m staying for the summer semester is because I’m going to use that time to do something about the giant eyeball.

The Rain Chasers won’t be around to get into trouble.  Maria is going home for the summer so I won’t have to worry about her being in harm’s way.  Cassie will also be gone.  She seems apprehensive about leaving, but I’m assuming the end of the semester is bringing back bad memories for her.  I haven’t told her about the devil or my plans to do… *something*… about the eyeball monster.  She doesn’t need to spend all summer worrying if she’s going to come back and find her roommate has vanished again.

Yes, we signed up to room together again in the fall.  It’s worked out well so far, after all.

I only know one person staying in town over the summer.  Grayson’s family lives here, so he’s not going anywhere.

It feels strange watching everyone pack and make plans for going home all around me.  Like I’m just standing still and the world keeps on moving.  I feel very alone.  I’m not sure I’m going to like the summer semester.

At least finals are done with.  They were… something.  I did fine, except for that one sociology paper I put off until the last minute and then had to pull an all-nighter to write.  Around 4 AM I thought it’d be good to go to bed and get a little bit of sleep and then finish it up in the morning, but poof - the devil showed up and was like oh no, it doesn’t work like that.

You ever felt like time was passing so slowly that an hour felt like three?

Yeah.

….yeeeeeah.

I think I know what that feels like in a literal sense now.

And he was breathing down my neck the whole time pointing out everything from spelling mistakes to where I needed more citations instead of just pulling stuff out of my ass.  I paid for the extended all-nighter the next day, too.  I went to bed at 5 PM and didn’t wake up until the next morning with what I assume a hangover feels like.

I got a solid B on that paper though, which I believe will net me an A in the class overall.  He might be the world’s bitchiest tutor, but he’s certainly going to make sure I stay in school for all four years.

Unless I get myself killed first, that is.  It’s a possibility.  Because I’ve been experimenting with the pencil.

I’ve gotten to where I can hold it without it sucking my mind in and making me panic.  There’s a trick to it.  I don’t look at it.  I don’t think about it.  I think about what I’m going to do with my hand - the motions I’m going to make to write something, for instance.  Anything but thinking about the pencil itself.  If I slip up and let myself realize that there’s a pencil in my hand, that I’m holding this impossible thing that reaches out into incomprehension, then I put it back in the case and go do something else.  Like binge eating potato chips and listening to Taylor Swift a dozen times on loop.  

It’s not a great coping mechanism but it works.  I’m finding that ear worms are just distracting enough to keep me grounded.  (and if you want to know which one gets stuck in my head the most when I’m trying to use the pencil, the answer is *all of them*)

I still don’t know how to use it, which is a shame, because things have gotten weirder around here.

There was one class that didn’t do a traditional final exam.  Our grades were determined by a bunch of smaller exams we’d done throughout the year and attendance.  This was also the professor that didn’t cancel class because of the rain, for the record.  Instead of a final, we had a field trip.  

On our final day of class we piled into a small bus and were driven about twenty minutes off of campus.  I admit I was a little apprehensive and the subject of the field trip was doing nothing to ease my nerves.

We were at a wooded area that surrounded a shallow river.  This was my geology class and we were there to measure the river’s depth to better understand how erosion worked.  I was only half-listening as the professor talked.  My gaze was fixed on the river.  It was moving slowly, but I still felt a cold unease in the pit of my stomach.  I felt like if I took my eyes off it for an instant, it would churn up the bank towards where we all stood and sweep us away.

I dragged my attention back to the professor with an effort.  We weren’t on campus anymore.  The traveling river couldn’t follow us here.

“-to wear closed-toe shoes,” he was saying, quite annoyed.  “Did *none* of the women wear the right shoes?”

I turned around to face the group, trying to ignore the shiver that ran down my spine as I put my back to the river.  The professor was holding waders and surveying the female members of the class.  

He’d told us to not wear sandals.  And guess what?  All the other women in the class had worn sandals!  Sure, they were cute and I was a little jelly of a couple of them, but they were rather impractical for tromping through the woods and certainly not suitable for wearing waders over.  The professor had also elected to only bring two waders sized for men and the third was sized for women.  Clearly he believed in the stereotype that women aren’t willing to get our hands dirty and had decided to force the issue by limiting our options.  I’m not sure what I’m more pissed off about - that he bought into the stereotype to begin with or that my classmates *proved him right*.

Well, almost.

“Ashley is wearing boots!” a student near me helpfully volunteered.

And that’s how I wound up sloshing through the river for the other bank because I also got voluntold to be the one to measure the far side.

I no longer regret wrecking the curve on midterms.  They deserved it.

It didn’t seem like it’d be a big deal to wade over to the other bank, right?  I used to work on the campground.  Even though the lake wasn’t part of the land for most of when I was there, I’m still no stranger to doing outdoorsy things.  Wading through thigh-deep water is nothing.  

At least, it wasn’t a big deal before I came to this campus and saw what lurks in the river.  

I clutched my end of the line like it would save me and mentally cursed my classmates, the professor, and myself for thinking geology would be the easiest of my science requirement options.  At least by this point we were done taking the measurements we needed and I only had to walk back to their side of the river.  

Then the other student helping me reel in the line thought it would be funny to jerk on it real hard.  He said afterwards he was hoping to pull me over and into the water.  Which is a pretty stupid prank, I mean, it’s not like I’m going to hold onto the line like a dumbass and let that happen.  I let go of it and let it fall in the water.  He could just reel it in the rest of the way, I decided, and continued slogging through the water.

“Uh,” he said after a moment.  “Can you get it unstuck for me?”

I looked to the side and saw that the line was taut, vanishing downwards into the murky water.  Probably caught on a branch.  I reluctantly changed direction and trudged over there, struggling awkwardly through the water, taking small steps to avoid stumbling on the uneven river bottom.  This entire field trip was no longer fun and exciting.  I felt like I was hovering on the verge of panic and I focused on the task on hand to avoid falling over the edge.

I tugged on the line where it emerged from the water.  It gave, but only a little.  I followed it with my hand, searching for the edge of whatever it was caught on.  The water was cloudy with mud and I couldn’t see anything underneath its surface.

Something shifted close to my feet.  I froze, my hands poised just under the water.  It was just a fish.  That’s all.  Just a fish.  Yet my muscles refused to cooperate and I stood there, panicked into immobility.

The water in front of me thinned.  It ran shallow across a sleek, smooth surface that drifted up to float just below the surface.  An eye opened in the ebony flesh and stared up at me.  Dark brown, glinting with hints of amber where the sunlight struck it.  The creature shifted and I saw the flash of a row of ivory teeth.  

The line was clutched in its mouth.  It ground its jaw together and the line snapped.  Then it vanished back under the water and I saw hair rippling like seaweed, then the hint of a broad back, then nothing but the running water.

Someone was calling my name.  I glanced up, startled, and the professor yelled my name again and told me to come on back.  He seemed concerned, unlike my classmates, which were milling about in disinterest and staring at their cellphones.  I stumbled back towards the bank and he held out a hand to help me out of the river.

“You okay?” he asked.  “You went pale all of a sudden.”

“I got startled by something,” I replied, glancing back at the river and shivering.  “Must have been a fish.”

I didn’t tell him what I saw.  That there was something *big* in the water, something far bigger than such a shallow river had any right to contain.  Something with fur and a mane and a broad back meant to invite the foolish into touching it.

There was a kelpie in the river.  For that was the cheek and eye of a horse that had stared up at me, glinting with amusement with the line in its mouth.

What would have happened if I’d kept searching for it, flailing blindly underwater with my hands?  Would I have stuck fast to it and been dragged under to drown?  I kept to myself on the drive back to the school, shaken by this close call.

But there was something else stirring in the back of my head.  An idea.

I called Grayson once I was back in my dorm.  He had access to a car and could take me back to the river.  

I wanted to find the kelpie again.  And this time, it’d be just me, and the horse wouldn't have to hide in the water from all those watching eyes of my classmates.

It took some convincing.  Grayson didn’t like the thought of deliberately seeking out a potentially dangerous creature, especially not after dark as I’d requested.

“But that’s the neat thing!” I said.  I’d called him on the phone because this was time sensitive and I didn’t want to have this debate via text.  “There’s some stories where kelpies are more than just murder horses.  They can take on human form.  That means we can talk to it and maybe it’ll tell us why it’s here but there haven’t been any other traditional creatures lurking about.”

“But at *night*?”

“I saw it during the day and sometimes what form they take is determined by whether it's day or night.  If it’s a horse during the day, we’ve got the best odds of catching it in human form at night.”

“Assuming it wants to talk to us at all.”

“You can stay in the car,” I offered.  “It’s fine -  I’m used to dealing with this stuff, after all.”

“That’s even worse,” he sighed.  “We’ll go together.  I’ll text you when I’m on my way over at sundown.”

I didn’t tell Cassie what I was doing.  She’s afraid another roommate is going to vanish on her and I don’t want to legitimize those fears by telling her I’m deliberately seeking out an inhuman entity known for drowning people.  Though, in fairness I feel, kelpies have rules that they follow and I know those rules.  I felt like I was in familiar territory again.

Just like being at home on the campground.

It was well after sundown when we found the spot by the river.  It was hard to find, as it was just a dirt turn-off the main road with no signs to mark it.  I think Grayson drove past it three times before I finally recognized it and told him to turn.  I felt quite guilty by that point.  I was dragging Grayson out here to pursue a stupid and dangerous idea and I couldn’t even find the place I wanted to go.  He was patient, though, and told me I didn’t need to keep apologizing.  It was an adventure, he said.  It was fun to get off campus and he was done studying for exams anyway, so nothing else was going on for him.

I only felt *slightly* better.

Then we were getting out of the car with our flashlights and I had bigger things to worry about.  I went over the plan with Grayson as we followed the narrow footpath down towards the river.  No getting close to the water.  Stay well up on the bank.   No approaching anything we saw down there - human, horse, or otherwise.  We’d keep our distance and if things seemed even the slightest bit *off*, we’d cut and run back to the car and get out of there.

“You don’t seem as nervous as I’d have expected,” Grayson commented.

I was focused on the river up ahead.  I could hear the sound of water gently lapping against rocks and debris.

“Kelpies aren’t as scary as other things if you know what you’re doing,” I replied absently.  “They require you to make a mistake.  They won’t just attack you unprovoked.”

It wasn’t like being carried through the forest by the shulikun.  It would be fine.  Still, my mouth was dry, and a healthy dose of fear fluttered in the depths of my chest.  It might not be as dangerous as some other things I’ve encountered, but this still wasn’t safe.

We were within eyeshot of the river.  I shone the flashlight up and down the length of it, searching for the shine of dark eyes.  Nothing.  

“Hey,” I called out tentatively.  “So.  I know there’s a kelpie out here.  I saw you earlier today.  I just… have some questions?”

SIlence.  I stepped forward and gestured for Grayson to stay where he was.  Did I need to enter the river?  As long as I didn’t put a hand on the kelpie’s body it wouldn’t have any power over me.  I carefully picked my way down to the water’s edge.

“I thought you said we weren’t getting close to the river,” Grayson said.

Why did he sound so amused?  Was he just waiting for me to break my own stipulations?

“Shut up,” I muttered.  “I’ve got this handled.”

“Sure you do.”

He still sounded amused.  Clearly, he didn’t expect the kelpie to show up and was just coming along for the fun of it.  I spun on him, something inside me stretched thin and vibrating with… desperation?  Anger?  I’m not sure what I was feeling, only that I felt *so much* and I didn’t know what to do with it.

“This is serious!” I snapped at him.  “There’s some really awful things happening here and I’m the only one that can do anything about it!”

“Sorry Ashley,” he said hastily.  “I wasn’t laughing at you, I swear.”

“But you think it’s stilly-”

I’d started crying.  It wasn’t him.  He didn’t make me cry.  It was… everything else.

“I think right after finishing finals is a terrible time to do anything important,” he said carefully.  “I think we should go back to the dorm and try this again some other night.”

I wanted to argue, but I was standing there with the water of the river lapping at my heels, crying openly for reasons I couldn’t exactly understand.  He was right.  I was a mess.  I wasn’t in any state to do this.  So I began to walk up the bank, back to where he stood waiting, and that was when I dropped the flashlight.

It wouldn't have been a big deal.  It just landed on the ground, spun about, and the beam fell on the surface of the river.  I bent over to pick it up.

That was how I noticed the color of the river.

Black under the night sky, except where the light touched it.  Muddy brown.

Tinged with streaks of red.

I snatched the light up and swept it back and forth over the water with shaking hands.  Had I imagined it?  Did I really see blood?

I told Grayson to wait a moment.  I thought I saw something.  I wouldn't go far, I promised.  

“Uh, no, I’m not letting you go off on your own,” Grayson sighed.

He picked his way over to where I was.  I wanted to argue with him, but he didn’t give me the opportunity.  He just started walking upriver, sweeping his light back and forth as he went.  I moved more slowly, searching the ground intently for anything unusual.

That is how I found it after Grayson had walked right past.  I looked at it for a good long moment until Grayson realized that I wasn’t following him anymore.  Then I said that it was fine, I was pretty sure I’d been seeing things and we could leave.

He doesn’t need to know what I found.

He doesn’t need to know that there was a patch of ground that was churned into mud.  That there were footprints - human footprints, arrayed in strange ways like they were stepping sideways as a group - sunk deep into the soft earth and in the recesses left behind was liquid that was too thick and too dark to be water.

And that there were hoofprints as well, prints that ended abruptly with a long swath of smooth earth, a streak where something large had been dragged into the river.

I think I know why there’s no recognizable inhumans on campus.

The eyeball is a weapon, the devil said.

And whatever is controlling it is killing the other monsters off.[\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

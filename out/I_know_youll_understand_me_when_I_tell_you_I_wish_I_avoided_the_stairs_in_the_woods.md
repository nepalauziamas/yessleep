You’ve all probably read this one before and that’s exactly why I need to post this here... I saw a set of stairs in the woods leading to a door. *2 sets of stairs to be exact.* 

One set pristine and leading to a white door glowing high in the branches, while the other set was made of moss and jagged stones carving a deep path in the earth to a gnarled wood door out of some folk horror nightmare. 

I saw these 2 sets of stairs when I went for a hike not too long ago. Work and life had gotten a bit much after things opened up again and I needed a day to myself in the woods away from it all. The irony of "getting away from it all" after the last few years of not having much to physically run from is not lost on me, but it's strange how these things work out.

The hike wasn’t a particularly hard one though. It was just enough to avoid my own shit for a day before heading back to the parking lot, but of course, my stay ended up longer than I expected.

Now when I initially saw the sets of stairs I remembered the stories online of stairs in the woods and figured 1 of 2 things: 

1. I’m way way way out of shape from the past few years mostly inside. This was too much all at once and exhaustion is making me see weird shit. 
2. *This is real*. This is *very bad* that I’m encountering this. I should turn right the hell around and pretend I never saw them. Nothing good could come of investigating them further. Drink some water and gtfo. 

After that swig of water the doors were still there, so I turned right around to get the fuck out. 

*Naturally*, the path I came on was gone. 

All around me was dense forest and trees that stretched so tall it felt like the sky had turned green—with the only light in the world barely piercing through the foliage. Those patches of light slipping through the leaves stood out so starkly the more I wandered around my new surroundings. 

I first wandered with intense urgency to find my way back to the yellow labeled trail I was following, but none of the surrounding tree bark had any paint on it. I then wandered aimlessly as exhaustion from what felt like an hour of trying to hold back sheer panic cut into my situation. 

I then wandered with a sense of hopelessness. 

I kept going in a damn circle and arriving back at those stairs, and ya’ll would be shocked at how mundane the weird becomes once you break through the wall of terror and right into a void of exhaustive despair. My ragged breathing and blood pounding in my ears was the only thing to remind me that this was real and not a dream.  

Of course the path I was on was gone. 

Of course the trees looked unfamiliar. 

Of course I panicked a bit and lost my sense of time. 

Aaaaand of course that door at the top of the first set of stairs was so bright and warm, inviting like a nice fire on a winter’s day. 

*Isn’t that how these things trap dopes like me*?  

What shook me out of my fixture on the door in the leaves above was that once the pounding in my ears slowed down, everything was silent. The leaves didn’t rustle in the wind. No sound of birds. No scurrying of small animals. Just total and complete silence. I never felt so lost in my life before that moment of realization. Just total and utter silence. 

I wanted to scream to fill that void. But the void had its own response.

3 knocks booming from the door deep in the earth. 

It echoed throughout the area loud enough to rustle the still leaves. I slammed my hands on my ears and cried out in pain from the sound. I didn’t notice any birds that flew from the trees, nor animals that attempted to run from the reverberation of the knocking. Just me trying to curl up in as small of a ball as possible.

My head was screaming. 3 seconds after each set of knocking another triplet of knocks erupted up from that cavern shaped around the steps. I couldn’t take it, I swore my head would explode if I stayed there, and so I did the thing most people do during a crisis. I ran for the high ground. 

I took the steps two at a time trying to get as far away from the knocking as possible. I misjudged the height of the stairs, it was a lot freaking higher than I initially thought. Once I made it to the door I swung it open with all my might and launched myself inside. 

Once it slammed shut behind me the knocking stopped. 

I was at the end of a long dim hallway, and I could see about 30 feet in front of me before it got too dark to make anything out. But the knocking...god damn it I could still hear it. This time it was coming from in front of me.

It was much quieter this time but the same exact cadence. 3 seconds of rest before another set of echoes limped its way to my side of the hallway.

I had nowhere to go here and I REALLY need you to understand that. What choice did I have but forward? Go back out and have my brains turn to mush from the sound? And this was how this shit worked anyway right? I’d see the source of the knocking at the end of the hallway, be terrified, and then get out to be told I was crazy and imagined it. I had *no choice* but to see the nightmare through.

So I turned on my emergency flashlight that the Boy Scout in me always brought on a trip and pressed on. Manically, if I’m being perfectly honest with you. The sooner I got to the other side the sooner this would end.

I was getting close to the source of the knocking. I lit up the small flashlight as I made my way into the dark. It barely cut through but I could make out my surroundings a little better. The floor was concrete and sterile, like something you’d see in a government bunker in a movie or something. It did not belong in the fucking woods. But the walls and ceiling certainly did. 

They were rock, but the kind of rock you’d see if you dug around some tree roots and into the dirt seemingly held together by dirt laid out like concrete in between bricks. The ceiling had roots coming out of it wrapping the rocks there together. Yet for all the dirt and earth nothing in here smelled fresh. In fact, there was no smell or not even a feeling of air. It was all still. I couldn’t tell if my sweating was from panic or if it was hot in the hallway. All the while the knocking held its cadence…until all of a fucking sudden it didn’t.

The knocking increased speed, as if begging someone to hurry and open the damn door. Someone was at the end of this place. They might know something. At the very least there was an exit. 

I picked up my own pace with the knocking. As desperate as I was to get out, the knocking sounded more frantic. It transitioned to banging—followed by screaming. 

“PLEASE! PLEASE! PLEASE! NOT ANOTHER ONE! PLEASE! I’LL DO ANYTHING! OH GOD ANYTHING!” 

The panicked pleas were accompanied by sobs, honestly more like croaking. The poor bastard must have been screaming for hours here. Something in the voice though I could identify with, the fear, the agony…..and the fact it sounded exactly like me. 

“OH FUCK THIS!” I immediately yelled back. “Think I’m stupid?!? I’m just supposed to run up there and meet some…some fucking folk horror bullshit mimicking my voice and get fucking...eaten?!? FUCK YOU!” 

I said this to bolster my sense of confidence, that I was defying this insanity cause I was clever. I watched movies! I read posts on the internet! But yelling ahead at the unknown was about the dumbest thing anyone could do, as trying to enrage something I had no real sense of was worse than any other thing I could’ve done in that moment. 

To tell you the truth, I just didn’t care anymore. I was so tired and would’ve welcomed being mauled to death by some unknowable thing, and it seemed like the thing at the other end of the hall had run out of patience as well. 

I’ll never forget the blood curdling scream it…*I* made from the other end. I had no idea my vocal chords had that in them. It was a mixture of anger and hopelessness and violence I never thought a human could be capable of. The scream masked the sounds of running and out of the wall of darkness ahead I lunged out. 

My hair was matted and long from what looked like weeks without a shower or haircut. The clothes were dingy and covered in dark stains from shirt collar to busted shoe tip, and the smell of not having bathed properly in weeks pierced through any sounds I made like a bullet. But my eyes…good lord I’ll never forget that bloodshot look I gave. The whites were nearly red and the mixture of desperation and wildness in them took all my attention away from the raw skin they were sunken into.

Now, I’d like to tell you we had some sort of deadly struggle that I came out on top of but to be perfectly honest, I swung once with all my panic and clocked myself right in the face. I staggered, and as I staggered I took advantage and tackled me. 3 more swings knocked me the fuck out.

I’m sorry for the confusion in how I’m describing this to you but it really was just me that tried to kill me. No weird creature mimicking me or some alien doppelganger trying to replace me, but just another me. Everything I carried on the hike that day was on him, just in more disarray. His wallet and ID the same. Birthmark on the left shin the same. Hell, the motherfucker had the same glasses and star wars wristband for his fucking apple watch. 

I was hyperventilating the more I assessed this situation. I needed to run. I needed to leave whatever the fuck this situation was behind, so I headed for the sound of the knocking that stopped. There must be a door he was banging on. 

Instead I tripped over a body and fell on top of another body lying next to it. My flashlight clattered next to me and the light revealed well…a whole lot of me. 

My throat was slit. 

My head caved in. 

My wrists slashed. 

***You get the idea.*** 

I was spiraling here, you all can’t imagine having to stare at yourself dead over and over again and have it be real. Have the smell slash through your nose. Look at your lifeless face ranging from fresh to bloated. My faces acknowledged me as I tripped and stumbled through the pile of them. The room just got so hot the faster I tried to move and all the water I drank that day rapidly left my body. 

This had to be a nightmare. Some sick dream with my subconscious fucking with me. I could wake up soon if I just reached the goddamn door. In that moment I remembered the intense thoughts I had when I was much younger of what death would look like on me, and I'm not afraid to admit the pain I caused to stop feeling numb, but to see my own demise laid out in front of me like the back of a butcher's shop was beyond anything I could have imagined. My wildest delusions couldn't have cooked this up. 

When I eventually reached the door I was barely struck out of my terror by how ordinary it looked in this whole nightmare scenario. Like any old door in any old house or apartment. It looked so small against the huge knotted wall surrounding it. I desperately reached for the knob, turned it, then heard my raspy voice. 

“Let me come with you. I’m-I’m fucking sorry. You don’t know what it’s been like in here. You don’t know what they all told me when they saw me. You don’t know what I’ve seen. I won’t lash out again. Just let me go home. You’re the last one, at least that’s what he said before. You must be. Please, it doesn’t have to end like it did for the rest.”

There I was concussed and crawling through the body strewn floor trying to bargain with myself. A wretched and pathetic thing. I’ve never had so much self loathing as I did then. I begged and I begged. I told myself I would explain everything the minute I agreed to letting me tag along. We could work together to open the door. 

All I saw was a madman. A starved and wild madman that killed me. Again and again I killed me. There was no reasoning with myself. I knew what I would do out there.

So, of course I had to kill me. This was the test right? Whatever fucked up god put this challenge before me I was meant to kill the loathsome version of me. 

I was in the right. 

I had killed and would kill again. One more good look at me and I knew I couldn’t be trusted. I couldn’t let myself back out into the world after this. 

I was still thrown from a loop from just waking back up from consciousness so strangling myself was the easy part. And for the first time all day I knew what was real. 

The feeling of rage vibrating through my arms as I squeezed tighter and tighter. The tensing of my neck muscles as the air was being cut off to my lungs. The wide eye look that got redder and redder the closer to death I drew. The spastic kicking and punching I did to avoid slipping away. The relief I felt at the end.

I barely remember going through the door after that. It was open once I turned around. The birds were chirping as the cool spring breeze caressed my face. I saw the yellow circle on the bark of a tree at the top of the stairs like a lighthouse in the dead of night. 

I glanced back and saw myself lying dead in the outline of the door. I shut it and walked up the earthen steps without a second thought. I dared not look to see if the pristine door was still in the trees.

And now, well I’m here sharing this with you all. Only you all would believe such a thing. That I was in the right for doing what I did. That I had no choice. That there are things in this world we can’t comprehend but that force our hand to take extreme measures. They test us. Perhaps they delight in it. All I know is, is that I'm the one here now. I had to be. 

I’ve explained this to some of my closest friends who think I went crazy being lost in the woods for an extra week when it was supposed to be a simple camping trip. 

I've stopped trying to correct them on the details. It had been at most 6 hours being stuck wherever I was during my day trip. I didn’t get back in contact for a few weeks after the ordeal because I needed time to myself to process what had happened, to let the nightmares of the white door in the trees to subside, but I wasn’t missing. 

I found myself out there. 

And that’s the truth. Which I know you’ve probably read before here—and that’s exactly why I know you all can understand me.

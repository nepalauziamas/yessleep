I can still remember the day before it happened. I was in my room listening to music and catching up on the piles of homework that accompany being a Highschooler. My Mom and Dad were in the living room watching TV, probably Football as per my dad's request.

My brother was in his room talking to His girlfriend on Snapchat, and it turned 8:00. My family has a rule about electronics going away at eight, so my dad would usually stop by our rooms to remind us. But he didn't tonight.

I thought that maybe he was trying to test if we would put away our stuff without his reminder, so being a smartass, I decided to wait for him to come later and get a little more time to watch youtube for a bit. But he never came. I got lost in the endless suggestions that Youtube gave me, and I didn't even think anything was off until the power went out.

When that happened, I got up and walked into the living room to see if my parents were still out there. They weren't. So I checked their bedroom. Not there either.

I began to worry at this point. they hadn't told me about them going anywhere late, so I checked the fridge for any note about them leaving. Nothing.

I went to my brother's room to see if he was still awake. He wasn't in his room at all. His phone was laying on his bedside table, and I knew he couldn't have gone anywhere without it. I turned it on and looked at the time. 11:24. I had school tomorrow.

I figured they had just gone on a night walk and had just decided to leave me because I was being difficult. I brushed my teeth and fell asleep.

...

The power was still off when I woke up, so I didn't know what time it was. Usually, one of my parents would come through the door and yell at me to wake up. I walked out into the kitchen expecting my dad to be scrambling eggs, but nothing. 

I checked all around the house, but no one was anywhere there. Not even my mom, who was usually always in her office on a video call. At this point, I walked out into the street to check for any signs of life.

There were no cars in the street, no lights in any windows, no dogs in any yards. No life. Not even the birds were chirping. The only sounds were my shoes slapping the sidewalk as I strode down the street to my family friend's house.

When I knocked, no one came to the door. Maybe they were sleeping? I rang the doorbell. Silence. I pressed the button about 18 times before just trying the knob, which was surprisingly unlocked. I stepped into the house and called out their name. 

Nothing except my voice echoed through the home. I took off my shoes and started up the stairs to the second floor. I checked all the rooms, even the bathroom (after knocking first). No one. 

I could tell you about all the houses I looked through without finding anything, but that would waste time, so I'll just skip to the part that matters.

After exploring and searching every house in the neighborhood, I was starting to think that this was some kind of dream. I tried blinking a bunch of times since it had worked in the past when dealing with escaping bad dreams, but after that, I was still standing in the street.

I had lost hope and Trudged home, some thought that this was a prank my only foothold to keep me from breaking down right there. at this point, the sun had started to set behind me, and darkness was beginning to creep across the houses and lawns.

Then, up head, I saw a streetlight flicker to life. I thought I saw the shape of a man standing under it. I yelled out, and the figure turned towards me and started to walk forward. the streetlight it was standing under went out, and one closer to me flashed to life allowing me to see him better.

Well, I discovered that that thing wasn't a man. It wore a tattered hoodie that had splotches of dried blood painted across it, a pair of jeans that were shredded and bloody topped tattered running shoes, soles visibly detaching from their bottoms.

And that face. At first, I thought he was wearing a mask, but when that deep growl emanated across the houses, I realized that it really did have the head of a wolf. But its head was rotting, bits of skin and fur peeled, and large sections of flesh were torn off, revealing the bone beneath.

A black liquid dripped from a sharp maw full of crooked teeth. As it drew closer, I saw the same substance dripping from its void black eye sockets.

I nearly passed out right on the spot. The events of the day combined with the horrifying sight made me want to freeze up and accept my fate, but some other force drove my legs to move backward, stepping away from the thing.

It felt like walking with weights tied to my ankles, but the further I got from it the easier it became to run. I was retracing my steps when A cross between a howl and a man's scream echoed across the rooftops. I was a few blocks away from my house, and for some reason, I thought that if I made it there, whatever was chasing me wouldn't be able to follow.

I turned a few more corners before stopping for a few moments to take a breath, but it was short-lived, as I heard something tearing through the backyard of a house up ahead. the thing burst through the fence a ways ahead of me and locked its eyes on me.

It came at me in a crawl, like a drunk dog trying to run at top speed, and I saw that it had sharp hooked claws that clicked across the sidewalk as it approached. I ran across the street and to another sidewalk that connected the house behind mine's gate outback.

When I reached the gate, it was unlocked like everything else in the neighborhood, and I burst through it and slid the lock, which didn't do much since the thing was already digging its claws into the wood in an attempt to climb over the gate.

I ran over to a large bush on the far side of the yard and practically slid under it, diving facefirst through a hole in the bottom of the fence on the other side. I'd discovered the hole when I was 7, and I and the kid in that house would use it as a shortcut to get to each other's yard. 

I wasn't sure I'd be able to fit, in because I hadn't used it in such a long time, but by some miracle, I squeezed through. And right in time, I felt the thing's claw tear into the end of my pants as I pulled my legs through.

But I knew it would be over the fence in seconds, and I racked my brain for a place to hide. I eventually settled on the tool shed that we never used on the side of the house. Right as I closed the doors, I saw the creature pull itself over the fence.

From in the shed, I could hear its anger, tearing up flowerbeds and smashing pots on the porch. Eventually, it made its way into the house and I could hear things being mangled inside. It went on like that for a while. I lost track of time.

Eventually, all the noise stopped, and I stepped out of the shed into the morning light. I looked through the house and found deep gouges in the wall. The fridge was on the floor, the TV ripped from the wall, the couch, chairs, and beds torn up, and bleeding stuffing onto the rug.

The creature was nowhere to be seen, and strangely, my room was the only place not destroyed. I'm sitting at my desk writing this now, and the power I back on, so I have the internet to upload this. But I don't have long before night falls again, and that thing comes back. And this time It will be worse because now it knows it's not alone in here, and it knows where I live.

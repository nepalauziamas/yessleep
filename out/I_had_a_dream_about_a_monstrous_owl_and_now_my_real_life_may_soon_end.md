The longest nightmare of my life began with a dream. Within this dream, I saw a towering owl. This owl totem appeared to be more than 20 feet tall in the dream when I saw it. Its eyes were lit aflame like hot coals, and the ground began to shake. A voice from behind me said something I didn’t understand, and when I turned, there were twenty hooded figures in a semicircle, flanking this speaker.

I could not see the speaker’s face beyond the shadows of their red hood, different from the semicircle’s uniform blackness. The red figure pointed back toward the owl with a shriveled hand, and when I looked back, the owl was gone. A pit opened in my stomach and my heart fell through it as I awoke in my bedroom. After a brief moment, I was aware that what I had just experienced was not real, but I could still hear an owl’s hoot in the silence of my room. My eyes naturally searched for the sound, my mental state slipping into a panic. Trying to stay calm, I threw aside the blankets with trembling hands and stumbled across my room to the light switch.

Flipping on the light switch, there were no owls in my room, and my windows were closed; my mind\\ must have constructed the owl’s hoot, as it had the rest of the scene I’d experienced. Squinting my eyes against the light, I could still see the totem in my mind’s eye like it was still towering over me. The dream left me with a sense of dread, but I couldn’t figure out why. It was probably because of the vaguely occult imagery my mind had constructed.

Moving on from the nightmare, I checked the time to realize my alarm would go off in only twenty minutes. I chuckled to myself. “Hey, my nightmare gave me an early start to my day,” I said to myself.

Work did nothing to take my mind off my dream, however. All through my morning routine, its images were superimposed over every thought. Preparing my lesson plans for the upcoming lectures of the day, focus did not come naturally. I taught my students the same way I always had, but the class could sense my lack of confidence. They talked amongst one another and shared notes as I fumbled my way through the material.

When the bell rang to dismiss the students, I felt relief wash over me, and I’m sure they felt the same. They packed their things and left, earbuds inserted before they’d even left their desks. As I erased the whiteboard, a student approached me and asked if I was okay. I replied with a generic “Yeah, I’m fine, why do you ask?” and as I turned to make eye contact, I saw Tony standing before me.

Tony is what most people would refer to as an “edge-lord.” The only colors I’d ever seen him wear were black, gray, and some shades in between. The kid even wore black eyeliner, and he made it look good, too.

“I ask because your lesson today sucked,” he replied, stating it like it was.

“I’ve got a lot on my mind,” I replied. “Just one of those days. Next class will be better,” I assured him as I organized papers on my desk that had no place being there in the first place.

“Alright. See you tomorrow,” Tony replied.

The next day, my lesson wasn’t any different. I had slept better the night before, and the owl was no longer bothering me, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the lecture. As the students left, they seemed to be in a hurry to leave; all except Tony, who awkwardly waited for all the other students to leave before approaching me. “Mr. Cliff, have you been having nightmares?” he asked me.

I kept erasing the board even as I gave him an inquisitive look. “Why do you ask?”

“Is it the dream with that owl statue?”

Now I stopped erasing. I thought for a moment, then turned to face him. “How did you know about that dream?”

“I’ve been having them myself, and you were in them with me. Do you use the internet?”

“I’m in my thirties, of course I use the internet,” I replied, trying not to feel insulted.

“Right, right. Look up something called the Bohemian Grove online. That owl thing is there.”

I took in his words for a moment. How had he known about the dream? Is it true that he saw me in one of his dreams? “Thank you, Tony, but you don’t want to be late for your next class,” I told him.

“I’m just leaving. Remember, Bohemian Grove.”

That night, I looked up the Bohemian Grove, and there was the giant owl on the front page of Google. I immediately got the sensation that I was being watched by an unseen entity. Knowing I was alone, I still check the area around myself. I lived alone, and this stupid owl couldn’t change that. I resumed my research, never quite shaking that feeling.

Apparently, the Bohemian Grove was an area in the woods of California where high-ranking politicians would go to meet. I found it difficult to tell fact from fiction among all the conspiracy theories, though. Some people believed it was a cult, others said it was the headquarters of the Illuminati, and one theory even said aliens visited them at the site during ceremonies.

All of it sounded insane, which was made even more crazy by the fact that I saw the statue in my dreams. Sure, it was just an owl, but I was there, at the ceremony grounds in my dream. I’d never heard of this place before either.

The next day, I taught my lesson in a haste. The students’ expectations for me were low anyhow, they probably didn’t even want to be there. After class, Tony approached me, and I was happy he did, because all I wanted was to talk with him about what I’d read.

“Tony, how do you know about the Grove?”

He shrugged. “I don’t know, I guess I’m just into that stuff.”

“Have you ever been there?”

He hesitated for a moment before saying, “No, but I’d like to.”

“So I get that you probably like cults or whatever, but how did you know about my dream?”

“Lucky guess,” he replied. “I saw you in the dream, and thought maybe we were sharing a dream. It happens sometimes between people.”

“Ah.” I had nothing to say to that. “Well, thank you, it was an interesting read.”

“Anytime,” he said, as he left my classroom.

Curiosity killed my ambitions for the rest of that week. When the weekend came, I did more research on the Bohemian Grove. By the end of Saturday, I’d read all there is to read on the subject, at least as far as I could tell. The topic consumed my life to the point where I forgot to get groceries, a part of my Saturday routine I enjoyed. Lying in bed that night, I dreaded waking up tomorrow. I knew that all I would want to do is research. It didn’t make sense how this owl, this ceremonial ground had gripped me in the way it had. This anxiety likely only made my nightmare that night even more intense.

There I was again, standing before the giant owl totem. Its eyes were not lit up this time, a fact that I found comfort in. Once again, I heard a voice behind me, except this time it was a chorus. I turned and saw the red-hooded figure’s back toward me as they conducted the black-hooded figures like a choir. Their eyes flicked from the leader back to the statue, and went nowhere else otherwise.

They spoke a language I didn’t understand, and their syllables were spoken in unison. I was remarkably lucid in this dream, so I looked around to try and find Tony. I didn’t see him. Turning back toward the statue, I saw that the owl’s eyes were still dark. Without warning, I was pushed to the ground by somebody behind me. Due to dream physics, I was unable to struggle in any meaningful way. Instead, my limbs flailed about and my gaze was frozen to the owl statue.

Pain began racing up and down my back, growing into what felt like a hole. I realized my attacker was cutting into me with something. The pain continued, but I could not scream. I could not affect what was happening to me; the figures’ chanting only grew louder. As the pain worsened, I saw the eyes of the owl begin to emit light.

The pain worsened, and my struggle seemed all the more futile. The owl’s hoot was in between my ears, inside my brain. In a dream, pain normally leads to me waking up, but not in this one. The pain continued to engulf my backside and made its way inside of me. On the ground, I felt lighter, almost as if I was losing my own organs. The dream felt like an eternity. It finally concluded when, squeezing my eyes shut in an attempt to wake up, I opened them up to see that the owl had gone. The worshippers behind me screamed in triumph.

Waking up, I found that I had been crying, and my clothes were soaked in sweat. I wasn’t in my bed anymore, I was on the floor on the other side of the room, probably from sleepwalking. I could still hear the owl’s hoot, and although the pain was gone, I saw the owl in my mind’s eye, watching unmovingly.

Holding my head in my hands, I tried to clear my mind but the image and the sounds refused to leave. Eventually, I realized that what I was hearing wasn’t a hallucination; I could pinpoint the sound. It was coming from my front door. The image of the owl’s flaming eyes was fresh in my brain, and something told me that the owl was there, right outside my door. I looked out my house’s front window, and my heart and brain screamed in unison.

There it is. The owl is in my front yard, facing my house. I don’t know what to do, except write my experience down. I don’t know what’s going to happen to me, if anything at all. Something tells me I’m not going to make it to tomorrow, though I don’t understand exactly why. I will add my experiences to this account later, if I am able to. However, I feel that I won’t make it that far. The pain in my backside may be gone, but the owl statue is not.

If these be my last words, let them be this: do not research the Bohemian Grove. Stay as far removed from that place as you can, physically and informationally.

Wish me luck.

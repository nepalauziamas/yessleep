What’s the best option when your five-year-old child is involved in the disappearance and likely murder of his teacher?

That’s right, there’s no good answer.

Coming forward to the cops would probably make me look guilty, possibly make Dillon appear to be a killer, and maybe implicate us both. He would be taken away from me in any case, and even if neither of us was charged with a crime (can you charge a five-year-old?), his trust in me would be shattered and his trauma lifelong. 

And any unknown guilty party would be rather unhappy that I volunteered evidence of their crime. [Since all we know about said party is their propensity to chop off ears and give them to kindergarteners](https://redd.it/wnd9y2), I’d rather avoid pissing them off. 

I could just ignore the situation and hope that it goes away on its own, which makes about as much sense as ignoring a fire that’s about to consume one’s testicles. 

The most sensible option seemed to be camping.

“I don’t like camping, Daddy,” Dillon whined from his car seat. 

“Sure you do, bud. Remember when we went to Lake Monroe and had all that fun?” I asked, my knuckles white on the steering wheel. I hadn’t been able to unclench my teeth since we started driving. 

“I remember when we went to Lake Monroe and I threw up on your jeans, and you said bad words because it got into your underwear.”

“Exactly. That was fun.” I wiped my brow. “We’ll have even more fun this time. Say, um, do you remember any more about where you got the, uh – ear?”

“Daddy, I already *told* you that the Crafty Man-”

“Right,” I answered, every muscle tense, “but I wanted to see if you came up with any better answer than the fucking Crafty Man.”

“You said the ‘fuck’ word.”

“Not what’s important right now, bud!” I replied in a voice that might have sounded chipper if not for the fact that near-panic had made me an octave too high as I turned off Route 1913 and onto a dirt road. “Say, do you want to learn how to burn things in a campfire?”

“The fire is what made me throw up last time,” Dill said as he squatted before the lapping flames. “You cooked chicken over it, but it was still cold inside, and I told you it was too cold, but you told me to eat it anyway, and I barfed on your pants and underwear.”

“You keep those details, but you can’t remember where you got a human ear earlier today?” I asked, looking up from the flames to the dying sunlight.

“I told you, it was the-”

“Right,” I cut him off, not wanting to hear the same creepy explanation yet again. “And those scratches on your back? That was him, too?”

Dillon nodded without looking at me. 

I sighed. “Hey, bud. Can you go make sure that your sleeping bag is all set up in the tent?”

He turned to face me, the fire dancing in the reflection of his glasses. “Is this one of those things that grownups have kids do because they want to be alone, and think that we’re too stupid to figure it out?”

“I left a Kit Kat on your pillow.”

Dillon leapt to his feet and darted inside the tent.

I sighed, pulled out the box from behind me and lifted the lid. I really, really didn’t want to look inside.

I looked inside. The dancing flames evoked deep shadows in the ear, flickering through its contours and gleaming off the lone pearl in the lobe. My stomach doing backflips, I reached inside and grabbed it.

Have you ever eaten shark? A severed ear feels similar. You’d think that it would be like touching your own, but human flesh at room temperature feels deeply foreign. The lobe jiggled as I lifted it, looking for all the world like a de-feathered chicken’s scrotum.

I tossed it into the flames, hoping that it would slip between the logs and disappear from view. Instead, it caught on a broken twig and sat atop a piece of wood while the flames consumed it. I watched it burn, bubble, melt, and pop as the ear deformed itself into charred goo.

Dillon was smiling at me as I turned around. “Ready for bed, Daddy?”

I didn’t know what awaited us, but I was relieved to have this chapter of the shitshow closed as I slipped into my sleeping bag. I laid my head on the pillow and closed my eyes. 

Something cold touched my toes. I was so tired that I waited a full minute before deciding that whatever was rolling around in my sleeping bag was worth sliding out and fucking around in the search for it. 

I found the object pretty quickly. It was large enough.

And even though it was dark inside the tent, the thing in my fingers was familiar enough for me to recognize it right away. Human flesh at room temperature feels deeply foreign, and the sensation is not quickly forgotten.

I fumbled with the tent zipper, holding the object at arm’s length, then rushed outside, praying that I was not holding a human ear.

It was a human ear. The appendage glistened in the moonlight as I gazed at it, slack-jawed, seeing but not believing the lone pearl in the dancing lobe. I don’t know if I believed in God at that moment, but I certainly believed in something akin to Satan’s idiot nephew who possessed supernatural abilities and a child’s worldview.

My stomach dropped at the thought. Dillon had been in the tent while I was burning this ear that had *impossibly* returned, unharmed save for the jagged tear where it had been torn from Ms. Brann’s head.

Wait.

My stomach flipped as I peered closer at the ear. The *left* ear. 

I had destroyed the right one in the fire. This wasn’t some kind of Satanic miracle.

Someone wanted me to find both ears.

Inside the tent, Dillon started [talking to himself](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

My eyes opened involuntarily when I felt my wife’s hands slowly running through my hair. Somehow it almost felt like I was greeted by a darker shade of light that when I had my eyes closed. My mind was still cloudy from sleep and I felt a strange faint yet stinging pain in my neck.

 I soon forgot all about it, losing myself in the warm comfort of my bed. Dreams like these reminded me of the good times when we first got married, back when we actually loved each other. It almost makes me forget about why everything went so wrong. But of course I know it was the money, isn’t it always?

  It’s funny, I didn’t actually care about her money when we got married but after a few years it was all that mattered. At the time I was even willing to look past all the abuse and exploitation incurred by her family to obtain it as well as her own role played in the shameful operation. I was simply struck, in love I suppose. I could not fathom that such a beautiful angel could be so evil. I guess I was just that naive. Now I’m sure, if there is a hell, she is definitely there, and I reckon I won’t be too long to join her.

 You see, at a certain point it became rather obvious that a divorce would be in the cards and I just could not let that happen. I had sold my soul to this woman, I could not allow her to take it with her when she left. In for a penny, in for a pound.

  And that is what these dirty peasants never understood and never will. It’s why my bank account’s balance starts with a B and they can barely afford to feed themselves. Because they are not willing to make sacrifices, they just don’t have the guts to cut themselves free from the bear trap and stumble onwards. It’s fucking pitiful. If one is to achieve anything of value, casualties are to be expected.

  Still, its nice to have dreams like these, just to reminisce about the times before everything went to shit, back when I could go to sleep without almost OD’ing on pills. 

  This one didn’t feel like a dream though, and as the slow caressing of my hair turned into sharp nails, dragging along my back, I knew something was very wrong. I quickly turned to the side, that’s when I saw my wife’s face. 

She had the white eyes of a dead fish and her skin had long since decayed. Despite everything, she seemed happy to see me.

 I was desperate to wake up from this nightmare but I could not, and it just kept feeling more and more like real life, as she climbed on top of me, pressing a sharp blade to my neck. I was still trying to convince myself this wasn’t real when she slit my throat, with such ease, in the casual manner someone would swipe a credit card. As the blood filled my lungs and stopped my breathing I knew this was real. But then I woke up.

MOVE.

That was the message we received from Miranda the realtor. Jake, Kat, and I saw it as soon as we’d returned to my house, still shellshocked from whatever the fuck just happened at Mason’s.

“Can’t,” I fired back on messenger. “Can’t afford to move. Trust me, wanted to my whole life. Why?”

“There was something in the house. It wouldn’t leave. Couldn’t be destroyed. It’s why we moved it.”

I’m not going to lie. I’ve gotten some pretty weird DMs in my day, but this was next level.

WHAT DO YOU MEAN WE? WAIT, BETTER YET, WHAT DO YOU MEAN, SOMETHING?

She didn’t respond. 

Another two days went by with authorities coming and going from the Blake residence, Mrs. Blake in the hospital, no sign of Ms. Fenley, and zero response from the realtor. It was very clear Miranda was straight up ghosting us. In the meantime, more and more weird shit kept happening in our town . . .

The ordinarily level-headed Mr. Cantazaritti, who lived on the other side of the Victorian, walked into Daly’s hardware store and lit himself on fire. Just like how one of those monks do when they’re protesting whatever it is monks protest. Except as far as anyone knew, Mr. Cantazaritti had nothing to protest. I mean, I heard him grumble about gas prices once, but that’s not really enough to torch yourself.

And then this morning, Mrs. Lowery (MY THIRD GRADE TEACHER!), drove her Pontiac right smack into the Hursts’ living room. And by smack, I mean she plowed straight through the front door and careened halfway into little Jimmy’s bedroom. Apparently, Mr. Hurst had just gotten up from his EZ chair to get himself a(nother) Coors. Otherwise, he would have been snapped to bits by Mrs. Lowery’s road, er, house rage.

It had to be the Victorian. Ever since it showed up to our shitty little neighborhood, the impossible happened: this town has gotten even shittier. 

We had seen enough. It was only a matter of time before something bad happened to Kat, Jake, and me. Or, even worse, we did something to each other. The three of us decided it was time to drive to where the house was moved and figure out what-the-absolute-hell was going on here.

\*\*\*

Even though the house was only moved from one state over, Louisiana, it took us the whole day to get across Texas’ fat ass.

We couldn’t use my mother’s car, so we took Kat’s Rabbit convertible. Before you say to yourself, hey that sounds kinda nice, let me preface it with the Rabbit’s roof was permanently stuck in the down position so technically I’m not sure you can even still call it a convertible. As a result, the wind smashed our faces the entire ride.

Jake and I used the long (windy) drive to search for house records online. We even tried the National Register of Historic Places. There wasn’t any listing for the house, so with no good ideas we decided to go straight to the house’s last known address, the one from the Facebook ad—5431 XXXX Drive.

\*\*\*

As we drove into the Victorian’s parish, we lowered the radio to listen out the windows, almost like we were trying to pick up the frequency of the town. 

I wish I could say it was dead quiet. That would’ve been somehow better than the weird, low hum.

We entered through a creek bridge, thick trees on both sides. A few stores—a general, a barbershop—dotted the intersections. Just past that were a couple of large houses. Nothing like the Victorian though.

Moving in the direction of the house, the roads began to feel more empty, a few cars puttering here and there, not much else. Plants were wilted, thirsty. A small farm’s crops waited in decay for hands that never came to pick them. On the other side of the street was a new development that looked like it had stopped mid-build.

There was a smell, too. It came in through the vents as we drove. I’m not sure whether it was my imagination, but it smelled just like that rotten basil stench in the Victorian. 

Getting closer, my eyes started to feel sticky and hazy. Like when I woke up having fallen asleep in my contact lenses. It was like a faint film covered everything. I asked Kat and Jake if they were picking up on it. They were.

To the unaware, this place might seem just like a town that was down on its luck. Like its sugar daddy factory left it for Mexico or something. But something felt different. It was closer to the abandoned homes I remember seeing in the 9th Ward after Katrina. Those occupants didn’t leave by choice and they definitely left in a hurry. What was it these people were running from so fast here?

\*\*\*

We were nearing that house’s old address, and I think we all sort of realized, then, that the feel of the town had been getting more severe the closer we got to our destination. Now that we were on the Victorian’s old street, it was very clear that this was the epicenter.

All of the houses on the block were empty and in varying states of abandonment. Half of the house’s lawns were spiked with faded ‘for sale’ signs that went unrequited. “They might as well be ghosts,” Jake said, staring at the vacant houses. 

We pulled up to the only empty lot on the street—the Victorian’s old land. For a split second, I thought I was looking at the Shole.

The spot where the house had stood was blackened earth, as though somebody had tried lighting a fire where it had been. Literally scorched earth. And just like the picture online, the shrubs and nearby trees slanted away from the land. But, now being here, the angle was so much more unnatural.

There weren’t any structures left behind, no basement or anything betrayed the fact that a house once stood there.

“What do I do?” Kat wondered. “Should I park?”

We came all this way to be here and now that we were, none of us felt comfortable being at this address. So we kept on down the road, parking along a cul-de-sac, turning the car around so we could face the land head on—as though we felt unsafe having our backs to it.

I took in the block’s failing disarray and then it dawned on me, “This is going to happen to Birch Street, isn’t it?” We all sat in quiet realization for a moment and knew we needed to do something.

Reluctantly, we slid out of the car and dusted our way toward the empty lot. The smell was strong here and the vibes were even worse. It was sort of that uneasy feeling I would get when we took the shortcut through the Glen Oaks Cemetery. Only ten times worse. 

We walked the land forward and back but didn’t find a single clue. After a little while, an unease grew and we were compelled to step off the land, like it was a frozen lake that could give way at any moment and gobble us up

The garage to the nearest house—clearly abandoned—was open. Rather, its garage door was torn away. Completely gone. We went inside. 

The kitchen smelled so bad that we were talking with our noses pinched. Unidentifiable food lay festering on the floor, and we were pretty sure we saw the corpse of a household pet mixed in with it. *I thought it was a guinea pig. Jake wagered house cat.*

Up on the second story, the flooring was pulled away, almost like it was a defensive strategy. Jake spotted what looked like bloody footprints on the bared wood. We followed the footprints to the bathroom.

In red, drawn on the bathroom window was—ONE-TWO-THREE, NOW I’M FREE.

Those were the words Mason had spoken. I suppose it should have scared me shitless. But, for the first time since the night at the Victorian, I felt like I was starting to get answers.

\*\*\*

As for the other houses along the street, we found plenty of weird shit.

Nonsensical graffiti with cryptic messages slathered the walls. Worn down candles and assorted religious paraphernalia were strewn about—like gonzo rituals had occurred. Another home’s front was riddled with bullets. Like straight up sprayed with an uzi.

But there was one house that took the bizzarro cake. 

Twigs and herbs hung from ceiling fans and shelves. 

The walls had all been painted black in a thick coating. It made the interior seem extra dark, even with our cellphones as pen lights. A weird sap coated the ceiling.

White chalk had been applied over the black walls. 

Unlike the scattered rantings in some of the other homes, there was more clarity to this lunacy, like this person was trying to solve the riddle

Drawn over the walls with chalk were overlapping circles, asymmetrical six-pointed stars, and knot shapes. And there was a whole lot of counting. This time, it was in reverse. *3, 2, 1.* Over and over. 

“Are those pentagrams?” Kat asked.

“That for devil worship or something?” I said.

“One sec.” Jake used his phone to connect to the internet. Cellular service over there was shit, but he eventually pulled something up. “No. These have six points. Pentagrams have five. It must be a hexagram. Possibly for protection?”

“And the circles and knots?” I glanced at Jake. Even before that Victorian arrived he’d been interested in this kind of stuff.

“If it’s all protective, I think it’s overkill, and I’m not seeing any hexagrams like that. This is something different.”

I walked into the kitchen. It was cleaner than the others, less desecrated. On the fridge, there were bills, postcards, child drawings and colorings. I took a photo from behind a butterfly magnet on the fridge. There was something very familiar about the man in the picture. He was standing with what may’ve been his daughter and wife at a beach.

I couldn’t figure who at first, until that sap dripped from the ceiling, falling over the face of the man in the picture. It was one of those workers who moved the house—Leaky Eye. But in this picture, from what I could tell, his eye was normal. And he wasn’t as skinny.

Calling Jake and Kat over, I did my best to convince them it was the same guy. Kat hadn’t been there when the house had moved in, and Jake hadn’t seemed to have noticed him.

“Maybe the moving crew were all from here,” Kat said.

“Seems unlikely,” I said. “What’re the chances of a structural moving company that can relocate a house like that being in their city?”

“Could’ve been that he volunteered to help,” Jake said.

Kat turned to the fridge. A note scrawled on loose leaf was stuck to it.

CINDY, the note read. THIS IS YOUR DADDY. BABY, IF YOU’VE COME HOME, PLEASE FIND A WAY TO GET TO THIS ADDRESS. GET A GROWN UP TO DRIVE YOU.

We Googled the address. It was a motel just 30 minutes outside our town.

\*\*\*

The motel was a couple miles right off the highway. The building was on the cheaper side of cheap, the kind of place spirit-guzzling divorcees spent their final paychecks on. 

We didn’t know Leaky Eye’s room number, if he was even still there. But before we could come up with a scheme for the guy at the front desk, we noticed that small unwashed white pickup we’d sometimes seen idling near the Victorian on our street. It was parked in front of the room. The caked-on dirt and the Louisiana plate cast away any doubt.

We knocked and waited for a few minutes of mouth-numbing fear. Speaking of my mouth, I had no idea what I’d say. I was practically trembling. It was fear, but it was also determination for how badly I wanted to beat that house and get everything back to its old shitty way, especially Mason.

Someone scuffed behind the door. There was a pause. Their weight leaned against it. I could feel eyes looking out at us, one of them probably leaky.

The door unlocked and groaned open.

He seemed skinnier than before, almost skeletal, and the fluid under his eye wasn’t clear. “What? What do you want?”

“We live in that neighborhood,” I said. “The one the house moved to. From yours.”

Kat gave him the note.

“You idiots,” he said through his teeth. He stepped forward over the threshold. We all reflexively retreated. “If Cindy comes back home and that note ain’t there—”

“We made a copy,” Kat lied, scarily quick.

“What happened to your family?” Jake asked.

This made Leaky Eye flinch, having no will to give us a proper answer. 

“You’ve got to tell us how to beat it,” I said.

“If I knew how, it’d already been done.”

“What was all that stuff you wrote over your walls,” Jake said. “What were you trying to do?”

He peered over our heads. His eyes tracked back and forth. The leaky eye was slower to follow. “You’d better come on in,” he said.

\*\*\*

“I’ll start with what I don’t know.”

We were all sitting on the floor. Leaky Eye sat on the foot of his bed. The motel room had a damp, mildewy milieu. There were no chairs.

“What I don’t know,” he continued, “is when that fucking thing was built. Not sure if there’s anyone alive who does. Sure, Victorians—and that one’s a Queen Anne Victorian by the way, least it acts like one—tend to have been built in the 1800s and early 1900s. Never can tell with a house like that, though. It’s gotten some facelifts over the years. No records, by the way. At least, I never found any. Maybe they were all burned.”

“Can we burn *the house*?” I said.

“No.”

“How do you know?” Jake said.

“Because we tried.”

“We?” Kat said.

“Yeah, all of us. The people from in and outside the neighborhood. It was destroying our homes and families. But fire won’t work. Trust me, that thing’s as fireproof as piss. Not to mention it likes to cover its tracks, so don’t be expecting any help from the outside world. If you notice your electrical shit ain’t working in that house’s vicinity, it means things have gotten really bad.”

“How?” Jake said.

“Yeah, this totally shouldn’t be possible,” Kat added. 

We waited while Leaky Eye lit a cigarette. He seemed reluctant to go on.

“You won’t find this on the books, but there was this story that got passed around. It was the closest I got to an explanation. During the Civil War, more widows were made than anytime before it. And lots of these broken families, mothers and small children, took up residency in that old town. They say the lakes were filled with fish. Enough to feed themselves and sell off the rest for profit. All the fish were gone by the time we all got there. Anyway, seems to be they got to building it up to a decent little community. But, probably, too decent. Because when the war ended and the reconstruction began, bunch of developers came in, setting their sights on the town. One by one, they pushed the women off the land. But one widow was too proud or stubborn to go. Didn’t stop the developers much. They just kept building around, trying to snuff out her will. It didn’t work. She didn’t budge.” 

“So..?” I said.

Leaky Eye coughed smoke. “So, one way or another next thing you know, her kid ended up dead.” 

“How?” Jake asked.

Leaky Eye wiped away a yellowish tear with his cigarette hand. “Developers say it was an accident. The mother believed otherwise. Either way, people say she went deep into the backwoods. Struck some sort of a deal.”

“Is it a curse?” I said.

“Curse is just one of them words we use to put sense to impossible things, right?”

“What about all those symbols you wrote on your walls?” Kat asked.

He smiled. Yellowy teeth, like he’d given up brushing. “When you’re fishing for something that you got no idea the size or scope of, you gotta cast a big net.” 

“What about the counting? My boyfriend, he was counting after he went in the house.”

Leaky Eye’s good eye snapped my way. The other dragged along behind it. “So was my Cindy. Right before we saw *her*.”

“Saw who?” Kat said.

“I don’t know what that house is. But there’s something terrible inside it.”

“The widow?” Jake said.

Leaky Eye nodded weakly. His thin shoulders slumped. “Maybe it’s that widow . . . or what woke up when they started new development in town. Doesn’t matter much. Can’t stop it. Grab your loved ones and leave before it’s too late. Lord knows I wish I had.” 

We sat stunned until Kat’s phone went off. It was her mother wondering where she was. Jake and I tried our mother, and we couldn’t get through. Kat didn’t live in our neighborhood. Her family wasn’t as close to that house.

Growing nervous, we got ready to return to the neighborhood.

Leaky Eye shrugged. “Don’t say I didn’t warn ‘ya.” He pushed himself up. “If you insist, you ought to know: treating this thing like a haunted house will get you killed. [It’s someone’s home, and whatever evil it is, it’s been there a long time.”](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rick_the_Intern/)

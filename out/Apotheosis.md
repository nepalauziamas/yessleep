&#x200B;

When I was a boy, I never once thought I’d reach the point where I am now and yet here I stand. I am of course eternally grateful for the many wonderful things that have happened to me. The growing success of Acumen is not something that I think I’ve taken for granted. But I won’t act as if I didn’t earn it. Not many people can take a small tech company and bring it into the fortune 500 in under ten years, but I’ve done just that. I turned Acumen into my company and in the next five years, I have no doubt that it will become a household name. 

&#x200B;

But five years is a long time to wait… I find that as I draw closer to 40, the years go by faster and faster. Time is not a construct I consider to be on my side and fate is difficult to predict. Anything can happen in five years. 

&#x200B;

Anything.

&#x200B;

Were I just an ordinary man, I would simply resign myself to being just another prisoner of time. But I am not ordinary. Not anymore. 

&#x200B;

No, today I’ve taken my first step towards my apotheosis. 

&#x200B;

I’ve had a friend in the world of rare books for a while now. It’s really just been a bit of a side hobby, but I’ve learned some interesting things from some of the old tomes I’ve found. Things most people wouldn’t be able to handle, mentally speaking. But I’ve got a much stronger mind than most. 

&#x200B;

My friend mentioned something very interesting listed at a low key auction in Hong Kong of all places. An intact and untranslated copy of a text known as *Grimuar Roshchi Feyri,* The Grove Fae’s Grimoire. I’ve only ever heard it referred to in other texts. Supposedly, it is one of the most comprehensive grimoires you can find. If you believe the stories surrounding it, it was not authored by anyone who existed in this Universe as we know it. Instead, it was apparently recovered from the personal Library of the Ancient God Shaal several thousand years ago. I don’t know if any of that is true, but it certainly makes this particular Grimoire sound especially tantalizing, don’t you think?

&#x200B;

You can technically find an incomplete version of the text (about 20-30 pages) if you look hard enough but none of it is particularly enlightening. You can find more useful spells and rituals in lesser grimoires. But an intact and untranslated copy… Well… How could I resist?

&#x200B;

I departed for Hong Kong immediately, of course and even before I left, I’d pulled some strings and greased some palms to get the Grimoire pulled out of the auction. With something this rare, one doesn’t risk it getting snatched up by someone else in some backroom auction. No. An intact edition of The Grove Fae’s Grimoire is not something I’d be willing to gamble on. I made a generous enough donation to the previous owner that they were happy to part with it and truthfully, I don’t think they or the auctioneers will miss it much. To them, it’s just an old book. A curiosity. I don’t think they’re capable of understanding its true value, otherwise, they’d never have listed it on auction in the first place.

&#x200B;

I have the tome with me now, as I fly home. It’s a weathered old thing and must be kept in a protective jacket to prevent damage. I haven’t dared to touch it yet, even though I so desperately want to… Better not to risk damaging it. Not until it’s in the proper environment where I can study it. I’ve already contacted someone who can assist me with the translation. Someone who I know can be discreet. If word gets out that I’ve gotten this, I could attract the wrong kind of attention. What I’ve got with me is more valuable than money could hope to buy. 

&#x200B;

If the stories about this tome are true, then what I have with me is the key to surpassing the limits of a mortal man. It is the first step on the path to Godhood.

&#x200B;

I truly can’t wait.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Journal of Alden Janssen.** 

**July 28th, 2021**

&#x200B;

Translating the grimoire has proven a time consuming task. I’ve hired on Professor Mortimer Galanti, a man I’ve worked with before. Galanti doesn’t ask too many questions and he doesn’t buy into the occult. He’s convinced that this is a religious text. His preference would be that I share this with the world but if I pay him enough, he keeps his mouth shut about that. The grimoire is in Old East Slavic and Galanti suspects it originated from what is now Belarus, during the 15th century. It’s almost certainly not the original text, but that doesn’t surprise me. While I’ve never found any recounting of what became of the original text, I assume it was either destroyed or reclaimed by the God it was stolen from. However, a near complete copy like this though should be enough for my purposes.

&#x200B;

Galanti’s progress has been slow and I will admit that it is my fault. He is only allowed access to the book at my home, while I am present. It’s not that I don’t trust him. It’s that I simply cannot afford to trust anyone. His protests on the matter have been noted and ignored. He’ll continue to work under the conditions that I dictate for him. I pay him well enough that he wouldn’t dare quit on me. Even if he wanted to, I know plenty of ways to keep him motivated… There are things men love more than money. That said, while his progress has been slow, it hasn’t yielded nothing at all. He’s sent me some translated pages that prove to me that this text is the real deal.

&#x200B;

I’ve practiced some of the simpler incantations. There is one that details an herbal tea you can brew that allows one to enter an astral state. My experiments with that proved highly successful. Other simple rituals include summoning rain or snow and a simple scarification ritual that removes my body's need for sleep. I figured that if I seek to achieve divinity, I won’t have the time for rest and after a few days without having felt the weight of physical exhaustion on me, I must say I feel freer than I have in my entire life.

&#x200B;

Galantis' most recent pages are of particular interest to me, however. About a week ago, I asked him to focus on any pages that contain references to the Ancient Gods and he has not disappointed me. 

&#x200B;

The translated pages he sent me last night detail how to create a weapon known as *‘The Finger of Unifying Death’*. Quite a mouthful, but if this truly is what the book claims it is, then I think it’s worthy of the grandiose name. According to the text, the Finger of Unifying Death is one of the few blessed weapons one can use to truly kill a God. Not just weaken or banish one… But outright kill it. That alone is interesting but one passage in particular stands out to me.

&#x200B;

*‘On the path to Apotheosis, the Finger of Unifying Death is an unrivaled tool for it is one of the few things that can carve the heart of a God.’* 

&#x200B;

Apotheosis… Carving the heart of a God… I suspect I see where this is going.

&#x200B;

I will of course wait until Galanti has uncovered more. But I already am looking through the texts I have available to me for any corroborating information. I have no reason to suspect that this text would lie. But it can’t hurt to be too prepared, can it? 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Journal of Alden Janssen.** 

**August 2nd, 2021**

&#x200B;

I’ve asked Galanti look for other mentions of Apotheosis in the grimoire. I was hoping it would streamline my process a little… And I was correct. Last night he brought me something fascinating… A complete ritual, dictating how to craft the Finger of Unifying Death. 

&#x200B;

This is the holy grail. Perhaps *the* most important ritual he could have given me. This is the key to Godhood… And it is within my grasp.

&#x200B;

The text he provided states that a Finger can only be crafted within a realm known as ‘The Gloom’. It is said to be the home of the Ancient Goddess Malvu and believed by some to be the afterlife, although I’ve heard conflicting accounts on the matter. To forge it, one needs to travel there. There are rituals that would permit one access to the Gloom, although they typically come with warnings advising against traveling there, as it is not a place where the living are meant to dwell. Needless to say, I didn’t come this far just to be deterred by simple warnings meant to keep out the meek.

&#x200B;

The Grimoire of Primrose Kennard details a fairly reliable ritual to physically enter the Gloom, by burning the bones of a fresh corpse. I’ll admit, I had a bit of trouble obtaining a fresh cadaver and it took no small amount of time to have the body discreetly prepared for the ritual… But I have the money required to make things happen discreetly. 

&#x200B;

A downtown crematorium was willing to part with the remains of one of their customers, and I know a man who has some friends in low places, one of which was willing to do the butchery for me, no questions asked. By early evening, I had the bones I required, and I laid them out as the ritual specified. 

&#x200B;

I burned the bones in a makeshift pyre filled with cypress incense. I had set the fire to produce as much smoke as possible and when I had breathed enough in, I found my way through the flames and into a place beyond.

&#x200B;

Many texts are out there that describe the Gloom… But I feel like very few of them do it justice. It is not a beautiful place, although it has beauty to it with a glum, dusky pink sky. Scarce trees dotted the landscape with a pale pink mist floating between them, making it hard to see too far into the distance. If this was the land of the dead… I’m not so sure I would have wanted to spend my afterlife there. But I suppose I only ever saw the part of it most mortals are permitted to see and I wasn’t inclined to trespass longer than I needed to. The Goddess Malvu was almost certainly already watching my every move.

&#x200B;

The mist was what I had come for. So I did not waste any time in setting to work. The ritual I had uncovered described a manner to forge a blade from it… The process takes some time. First, one must freeze just enough of the mist to form a base, and from there one must freeze bits more onto it to form a dagger. It is not a ritual for anyone who is not well versed in the arcane arts. But I have been studying for almost fifteen years now… Mastering my craft in the hopes that it might take me far. And so my effort paid off.

&#x200B;

Inch by inch, I forged my blade. My Finger of Unifying Death. And when the blade was formed, I carved runes into the ice to make sure it stayed intact. And when the work was done, I left the Gloom behind. 

&#x200B;

The blade is a beautiful thing… Crystalline and pinkish, but I can see a rainbow of other colors shining within as it catches the light. 

&#x200B;

I’ve bound it in some leather so I can hold it safely. Touching the blade with bare skin is so indescribably cold that it almost feels like it burns. I’d hate to see what long term exposure would do to me. The small tests I’ve done with the blade so far have shown it to be remarkably resilient. It goes through everything like a hot knife through butter. 

&#x200B;

This is truly a weapon of the Gods… And I think it will serve me well.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Journal of Alden Janssen.** 

**August 4th, 2021**

&#x200B;

I invoked my first God this evening… A weak thing, subservient to another Lesser God. But it was still a God. 

&#x200B;

I have set up a space in my basement where I can work in peace. I’ve established a summoning circle there and brought down both the grimoires I have in my possession, and Galanti’s translations from the Grove Fae’s Grimoire. Summoning Gods is no easy feat… Many of them are fickle and may choose to ignore you if they so please. The more powerful Lesser Gods are infamously difficult to invoke, and even if I could reliably summon them, I didn’t want to test myself against them. Not yet…

&#x200B;

The creature I summoned was known in the texts as ‘The King-Eater.’ I suppose it only barely classified as a Lesser God, and may be better defined as a fae who’d grown a little too powerful. But I was certain I could summon it easily enough.

&#x200B;

It appeared to me as a snarling, serpentine creature with a human face. The ritual I used dictated that one should offer it the heart of a sacrifice to appease it, lest it turn on you. However I saw no need to bother with that.

&#x200B;

When the creature was summoned, I simply brandished my blade at it… And watched as it hissed in rage. I wish I could say that this so called ‘*God*’ put up a fight. But it did not. No… 

&#x200B;

The Finger of Unifying Death did its work spectacularly… Slicing through the beast and leaving it screaming in agony as I delivered the killing blow. Against an ordinary man, it would have put up a fight, but against the power of the Ancient Gods, it was nothing more than a bug to be squashed. 

&#x200B;

From the corpse, I took its heart.

&#x200B;

According to The Grove Fae’s grimoire, consuming the heart of a dead God will allow you to take on a piece of it… To absorb that which made it a God. And so that was what I did. I ate it raw.

&#x200B;

And I can *feel* the change within me. 

&#x200B;

I’ve surpassed most men on this planet. I’ve taken my first step towards Godhood. I have slain a God and consumed its heart.

&#x200B;

I’ve taken some time away from work. I can have no distractions. Acumen will run itself without me for a time… I need to focus on this. I am close now.

&#x200B;

I will ascend.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Journal of Alden Janssen.** 

**September 9th, 2021**

&#x200B;

The Grove Fae’s Grimoire has given me so much… So many weaker Gods, ripe for the culling. To list them all would be a waste… No one will remember them, now that they are gone. 

&#x200B;

But they will remember me. 

&#x200B;

I have been busy. I think I’ve killed 15 now… One every few days. And I have become something new.

&#x200B;

The runes I scarred into my body made sleep unnecessary for me, but those runes are gone now. My body has no more scars. No more imperfections. My vision has improved. I no longer need my glasses. Yet despite the loss of the magic I carved into my flesh, I still don’t require sleep.

&#x200B;

When I eat, I only do so for the pleasure of eating. I don’t need food anymore. My mind feels clear… As if all superfluous thoughts have faded away and I can focus upon my singular purpose. And from that clarity has come genius.

&#x200B;

I know things I should not be able to know about the world, about the state of all things. Perhaps that will soon become omniscience… We’ll see. The few Gods who manage to lay a hand upon me don’t hurt me anymore. I’ve long since surpassed them.

&#x200B;

Magic has become trivially easy for me now. Once, I needed to use incenses and candles to leave my body and enter a more astral state. No more.

&#x200B;

I am advancing beyond what any other man should be capable of… And I find myself eager to pursue my next target. I may no longer need food, but I still hunger… 

&#x200B;

I need more.

&#x200B;

And beyond that… I need to test my limits. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Book of Acumen**

**September 21st, 2021**

&#x200B;

I have partially returned to work. Although I have no intention of allowing that to become my primary focus. No… I simply need a testing ground.

&#x200B;

Galanti uncovered a few new pages a week ago about the creation of sigils for Gods. I’ve been experimenting with that. I had considered trying to fast track a new company logo, but that would take too long. So I’ve tried a shortcut… 

&#x200B;

The Acumen logo isn’t a traditional rune. But I wanted to see if it would suffice. I carved it into stone and poured my energy into it. I left a part of me in the first carving… And I felt as I spread through the cosmos. 

&#x200B;

It worked.

&#x200B;

Wherever Acumen is… I am. Whoever wears the logo of Acumen, now belongs to me…

&#x200B;

The possibilities here are endless.

&#x200B;

I used to think that in five years, I could make my company even larger than it already was. Today, I think that in five years, I can become the new God of this world… 

&#x200B;

Already, I’ve sensed the change in my employees. They work differently now… I don’t even think they’re aware of it. My hands guide them in their work, and I’ve seen the beginnings of a new synergy. I’ll mold them, quietly, slowly, gently into my first Priests. My ‘workers’ will be my first congregation.

&#x200B;

When my new world comes, they will work for the glory of Acumen. 

&#x200B;

Acumen… 

&#x200B;

The man I took this company from chose it because he liked the way it sounded. Thought it was professional and made a statement. Truthfully, I agree. I like it.

I think it suits me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Book of Acumen.** 

**October 16th, 2021**

&#x200B;

I received a letter today. An invitation to some New Orleans bar… No text. No indication why it was sent. Only a name.

&#x200B;

Helena Malibu.

&#x200B;

Not a name I’m familiar with.

&#x200B;

And yet… Try as I might to look into her. I see nothing. I’ve been able to sense most others. But somehow she eludes me.

&#x200B;

Fascinating.

&#x200B;

I will go… See what this woman has to say. And then, I will decide what to do about her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Book of Acumen.** 

**October 19th, 2021**

&#x200B;

***HUBRIS.***

&#x200B;

I was generous. I accepted this Malibu woman's invitation and departed for New Orleans shortly after receiving her invitation.

&#x200B;

The bar she’d requested we meet at looked to be nothing special, and yet I could sense something awry with it as I drew near. An aethereal quality to it… As though it was there and not there at the same time. Still, I entered.

&#x200B;

A woman with dark hair was waiting by a table near the door. I could see into her soul… See the hardships of her life, before she’d fallen in with her current master. Behind her stern eyes, I could see a mistrust of me.

&#x200B;

  “Mr. Janssen?” She’d asked, “My name is Elena Crowley. Pleased to meet you. I’ve been asked to direct you to the back. My employer is waiting for you there.”

  “Your employer?” I’d asked, “Malibu?”

  “She’s with my employer.” Crowley replied, “Please. Come along. I don’t want to keep them waiting.”

She turned to lead me deeper into the club… And I obliged her. The club was not busy, and only a few people watched the act that performed that afternoon. 

&#x200B;

Near the rear corner of the club was a table with three women seated at it. The first one, seated in the middle was a youthful, lovely blonde with sapphire blue eyes, although I swear I saw a shade of pink or purple in them when the light hit them just right. Her hair was curled in an antiquated style and she wore a midnight black dress with a white fur shawl over her shoulders. She smoked a cigarette in a long holder. Perhaps it was just her style of dress, or the way she carried herself but she struck me as much older than she looked.

&#x200B;

To her left sat a woman with dark hair in a bob cut and a wry smile. She was dressed in a red cross front dress that showed off the pale skin underneath. She had a distinct muscle tone to her. Her scarlet fingernails almost resembled talons and her eyes seemed to shine crimson when I looked for too long. Like her companion, she also smoked. Although she favored a cigarillo with arcid smoke that twisted up from the burning tip.

&#x200B;

The last woman was the most unusual… Something about her seemed off, but I couldn’t quite identify what. Perhaps her eyes were too big, her mouth too narrow or her cheekbones too high. Her long hair was unnaturally white and she wore a backless white dress, revealing tattoos of angelic wings on her back. Her eyes were a pale blue that seemed almost gray. Unlike her companions, she did not smoke, but a cup of red wine sat in front of her.

&#x200B;

There was a spot beside the woman in red for a fourth person. But it was empty. 

&#x200B;

Crowley moved a chair to set it in front of their table, before giving a nod to the woman in red.

  “Ladies, Mr. Janssen is here.” She said quietly.

  “Thank you Elena. Have a drink on me, will you?” The Blonde said. With that, Crowley disappeared. 

&#x200B;

I took the seat she’d offered me, before studying the women before me. Each of them had a strange energy to them… As if they didn’t quite fit within this world. The woman in white was the most distracting, but they were all off in their own ways.

&#x200B;

  “Helena Malibu?” I asked.

  “I’m glad you were willing to accept our invitation.” The blonde said, “I was afraid we’d need to come to you instead.”

  “Were you now?” I asked, coyly, “Forgive me for saying, Miss Malibu but that sounds a little ominous.”

&#x200B;

Malibu offered a gentle smile.

  “Whether or not it is, depends on you.” She replied, “Allow me to introduce my sisters. Primrose Kennard and Annette Travis.” She gestured to the woman in red and the woman in white respectively.

  “Are we waiting for one more?” I asked, looking over at the vacant seat.

  “No. She won’t be joining us this evening.”

&#x200B;

Primrose Kennard took a long drag on her cigarillo.

  “Why don’t we get down to business?” She asked, “I don’t suppose you’ve got any idea why you’re here, do you?”

  “I didn’t… But now I think I can hazard a guess.” I replied, “Primrose Kennard… That name can’t be a coincidence. I’ve read her grimoire. I recall that she died some centuries ago. But I’ve heard someone else uses that name these days… I presume you’re Shaal?”

Kennard exhaled smoke through her nostrils, grinning as she did.

  “Read up on your history, have you?” She teased, 

&#x200B;

My attention turned to Malibu next.

  “And by that logic, you would be Malvu… Or is it Mal’ibo… I’ve heard many different names.”

  “Malibu will suffice for our purposes.” She said calmly.

&#x200B;

I looked over at the last of the women, Annette.

  “You… You’re an odd one though… You’re not the God of Creation. I doubt they’d wake her up just to deal with me. Hence the vacant chair. So you must be someone else… The Un-God, perhaps? Anitharith? Why would they bother to include you, though?”

Annette didn’t reply. She took a sip of her wine, displaying zero interest in me… And yet I somehow suspected I was right.

&#x200B;

  “Should I be flattered that the Ancient Gods themselves have invited me out? Or should I be concerned?” I asked.

  “We didn’t contact you to start a fight, if that’s what you’re insinuating.” Malibu said, “Although I should ask that you not take this invitation as approval of your actions either... I only ask that you hear us out. Listen to us and then you may go on with your little crusade.” 

&#x200B;

An appeal… This should have been good.

&#x200B;

  “Very well. Speak.”

  “You’ve done well to attain the power you’ve reached. In all the worlds we’ve created, few mortals have ever gone that far… But understand that we’ve taken steps to ensure that such power is difficult to obtain for good reason. It’s reckless use has… Consequences…”

  “Consequences?” I asked, “What have I done that’s of any consequence to you?”

  “Not to us.” Kennard said, “To you.”

&#x200B;

  “Reality is fragile…” Malibu continued, “While I’ll confess, I didn’t much care for most of the creatures you’ve killed. Some of them were not meant to die by your hand. You’ve yet to cause any meaningful damage beyond what we can repair… But at the rate you’re going, I’m afraid you’ll inevitably cross that line. The purpose of this friendly discussion is to ensure that does not happen.”

  “Is that all?” I asked, before laughing. “That’s why you called me here? To tell me that you’re afraid? What? Have I really grown too much for you in such a short span of time?”

&#x200B;

I saw Malibu’s eyes narrow. Kennard raised an eyebrow before chuckling. Annette looked at me directly for the first time.

  “Do not forget your place in our presence.” She said coldly, “And do not question our power, or imply we see you as anything less than a worm.”

&#x200B;

Malibu held up a hand to calm her.

  “You mistake my choice in wording for an expression of fear. So let me rephrase. Continue on the path you’re on, and the unnecessary discord you’ll cause will necessitate our involvement in your affairs. I’m simply looking to avoid that.”

  “Of course you are.” I replied, “Since when do the Gods ever want to get involved? Millions starve in this world. Millions suffer. Millions die. Injustices echo through the pages of history… And yet here you are, sitting in a bar, drinking and smoking while the world burns. You say you’re not afraid… But why else would we be having this conversation? Perhaps you’re worried that I’ll do your job better than you, is that it?”

&#x200B;

Kennard burst into open laughter.

  “Oh, you are just *adorable*. You think you’re the first mortal who gained a little bit of power, and declared themselves the Messiah? You think we didn’t do it ourselves, aeons ago, on worlds long since dead? It doesn’t work that way. Fix their problems and they’ll become dependant. Seize control, and they’ll beg to be set free.”

&#x200B;

  “These things require a delicate touch…” Malibu said, “A gentle push in the right direction. Not something you are equipped to give… I’ve watched you work. Whispering in the ears of your subjects, guiding their hands in the name of… What was it? ‘*Corporate synergy…*’ You’re hardly as benevolent as you claim.”

&#x200B;

  “A sorry excuse for a God…” Annette added, “You’re little more than a scavenger. A parasite feeding off others. No matter what power you’ve stolen, you remain mortal at heart. You cannot supplant us and even if you could, the horrors of the void would ruin you…”

&#x200B;

Their tones angered me… The disrespect in it. Like scolding parents talking down to a child. I would not let them speak to me this way!

&#x200B;

  “So then you admit that you are failures…” I snarled, “You tried to be Gods, and *you* failed! But I will not. You came here to beg me to stop, in the form of an ultimatum. Well I have an ultimatum for you. Stay out of my way, or I’ll destroy you just as I destroyed the others!”

&#x200B;

Again, Kennard laughed. She shook her head and wiped a tear from her eye.

  “Oh, I love it. This one’s got more balls than brains. Should we go right here, Little God? Would you like to see what true divinity looks like?” 

&#x200B;

  “No, Shaal.” Malibu said, firmly. “Think very hard about what you’re saying, Mr. Janssen. You are issuing a challenge that will not end well for you.”

  “Won’t it?” I asked, “From where I sit, all I hear is the pleading of a coward, looking to keep her throne just a little longer. I’m not entertaining this any further. My ultimatum stands. Stay out of my way, or be destroyed.”

&#x200B;

With that, I rose from my seat to leave. I did not look back.

&#x200B;

If the Gods wish to challenge me, then I will show them the price for their hubris and I will supplant them, just as I was always destined to do!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Excerpt from the Journal of Alden Janssen Jr.**

**October 23rd, 2021**

&#x200B;

I have seen into the void.

&#x200B;

I have stood against the Gods…

&#x200B;

And I see now where I have gone wrong.

&#x200B;

After they spoke with me, I returned home seething. In my rage, I summoned and slaughtered a few more of the lesser Gods. I even attempted to summon Bacchus the Mad God and Omylia the Deep Goddess as some Grimoires indicated that they held places of honor beneath the Ancient Gods. I had hoped that by killing them, I might spite them further. Yet neither would answer my summons. They too must have feared me…

&#x200B;

Instead, I killed some weak, pitiful creatures to give myself small boosts before deciding that I would achieve nothing by wasting my time. The Gods had challenged me.

&#x200B;

Malibu had challenged me when she sent me that invitation… And I knew it would only be a matter of time until she struck. 

&#x200B;

I told myself it would be wisest not to wait for her to attack, as I imagined she would rely on some cowardly tactic to try and catch me off guard. No… It would be better to travel back into the Gloom and confront her directly.

&#x200B;

Yes… I would slaughter the so called ‘Guardian Goddess’ in her own realm. I would claim it for myself and from there, cast down the rest of the Old Gods. Then, when Shaal and Anitharith had fallen I would drag Sailia from whatever slumber she was in, and rip her apart!

&#x200B;

I prepared the same ritual I had used before. It was easier this time. I chose one of my employees as a willing sacrifice. I carved the bones from his corpse with my bare hands and set them upon a pyre to be burned, and just like before I entered the Gloom, clutching the very dagger I had forged in this dead realm.

&#x200B;

The mists of the Gloom welcomed me, curling around me slowly as I set foot upon that sacred ground. I could smell a faint, floral scent in the air… And I knew that I was being watched.

&#x200B;

  “Come out, Malvu.” I called, “Face your judgment with dignity…”

As I spoke, I could see a figure moving through the trees. Something in the shape of a woman, but with the head of a wolf.

&#x200B;

  *“You’re making a mistake, Mr. Janssen…”* I heard her say, *“This will not end the way you want it to. Turn back. I will not ask you a second time.”* 

“You won’t have to.” I assured her.

&#x200B;

I spotted the face of the woman I’d seen before between the trees, and I lunged for her, driving my blade into her chest. It should have torn through her, as it had everything else… Instead, it shattered. Cracking and bursting into countless shards that seemed to drift away back into the mist they’d once came from. Their touch burned my hands and made me recoil.

&#x200B;

Malibu kept her eyes trained on me. Her head tilted slightly to the side. She’d barely reacted to what I’d done.

  “Did you think you were just going to stab me with a weapon made in my realm, and that would be it?” She asked.

&#x200B;

I took a step back, my eyes widening in shock.

  “Even if I could die, you couldn’t kill me with anything you forged in here…” She said, holding up a hand. I saw the mist swirl through her fingertips, moving almost like a loyal pet.

  “The Gloom… The mist… It all belongs to me. It *is* me.”

  “Then I’ll rip it all apart!” I cried. In my fervor, I was undeterred. I would destroy her, with or without my weapon.

&#x200B;

I felt the warmth of the power I’d taken radiating from my hands as I tore at her, ripping through her body… And yet she seemed to simply dissipate with every swing, fading away into the mist. There was no laughter. No wry remark. Only a calm judgment. 

&#x200B;

The mist swirled around the spot where Malibu had been, as she faded into nothing. In the blink of an eye, she was gone and I scanned the area around me, searching for some sign of where she’d gone. The mist seemed to grow thicker around me. Every breath carried a distant smell of lavender.

&#x200B;

As I tried to see through the gaps in the trees, I swore I saw something moving past me. Bright pink eyes watched me from between the trees. I could hear the sound of something panting… An animal.

&#x200B;

A wolf.

&#x200B;

Mist swirled off of its pale coat, making it seem to blend in with the fog around it. It stood almost twice my height and stared me down. There was no rage in its eyes… No spite. It regarded me with simple apathy.

&#x200B;

Staring at the visage of Malvu before me, I saw now what I had missed in my arrogance. She was not afraid of me. She was barely even annoyed by me. Up until now, this had not been a fight. She was simply studying me.  And what she was about to do next was a simple act of discipline. 

&#x200B;

The Wolf came for me, charging forward without a sound. I tried to fight back… But there was nothing I could do. Her jaws closed around my torso as she tore me from the ground. I felt her teeth digging into my body.

&#x200B;

She threw me like I was nothing, launching me several feet away and sending me crashing to the ground in a pile of mangled limbs. I still tried to pick myself up, struggling to breathe as I did… Blood gushed from my new wounds as panic seized hold of me.

&#x200B;

This was the first time something had wounded me… And the pain… God… The pain… It was worse than anything I had ever felt before.

&#x200B;

Malibu charged me again. Her jaws closed around my legs as she pressed one paw down on me. I felt her pulling, and I started screaming as she tore me apart. I could feel the flesh being tugged and ripping… I could feel the numbness replace the spots where sensation had once been.

&#x200B;

She was killing me… Slowly. Purposefully. She was sending me a message.

&#x200B;

I was not invincible.

&#x200B;

The Wolf stepped away, leaving me to bleed into the dirt. With trembling hands, I tried to crawl. But there was no escape from her.

 ***“I told you… This would not end well for you.”*** I heard Malibu say, ***“You so arrogantly came here to fight… And see where it has left you.”*** 

&#x200B;

She stepped into my view, her form having changed again. Now, her body still looked the way it had before. But she still had the head of a wolf. Her eyes were cold and blue as she looked down at me, regarding me with a bitter apathy. She reached down, grabbing me by the hair and lifting me up.

&#x200B;

  ***“Such a greedy thing… So self assured of your own superiority. So convinced this would be your apotheosis. You wanted to be like us… And yet you cannot be. You cannot fathom what exists outside within the Void. You can barely even stand in our true presence… Would you like to see us as we truly are? Would you like to see everything?”***

&#x200B;

I would have begged her not to show me… But I could not form the words. Malibu looked towards the mist beside us. I watched it part… But the Gloom was not what waited for us beyond it.

&#x200B;

What I say beyond the Gloom was only darkness. Malibu dragged me closer to the edge, and held me out into the Void…

&#x200B;

I looked.

&#x200B;

I saw…

&#x200B;

And I wept.

&#x200B;

Tears of blood ran down my cheeks as I felt it overwhelm me… I could see the things we were never meant to see. I could see the watching forms of Shaal and Anitharith looming nearby. I could even the true Malibu, vast and almost impossible to truly see. I remember only the feelings I sensed from her… Not rage. Not hate. But disappointment.

  ***“Such delusions of grandeur… You’ve brought this on yourself.”***

&#x200B;

At last, Malibu pulled me from the Void. She hurled me back to the ground where I lay in the dirt, my face smeared with blood and my eyes wide, and unblinking. Malibu stared down at me for a moment, before she turned away. As she did, I saw other shapes drawing nearer.

&#x200B;

A great pale bird landed in a nearby tree, looking down at me with blank white eyes. Crawling up from the earth, I saw an endless crimson centipede begin to make its way towards my body. Shaal and Anitharith… Come to feast upon my remains.

&#x200B;

  ***“As expected…”*** I heard Anitharith say.

  ***“Ah… But the unchecked pride will make him taste all the sweeter…”*** Shaal crooned, ***“A valiant display… It was entertaining while it lasted, wasn’t it?”***

&#x200B;

She laughed and Anitharith gave no response. As they fell upon me, I could do nothing but scream.

&#x200B;

As I felt Shaal tear through my stomach and dig into my chest, my screams died in my throat. I felt Anitharith’s beak poking through my ribcage. She tore off strips of my flesh while Shaal devoured my innards. 

&#x200B;

For hours, they feasted on me, letting me watch as they ate me alive… It seemed to go on forever, past the point where death should have taken me. And when they were done, when I was nothing but carrion… Then the darkness came.

&#x200B;

I woke up on the ground, in my backyard two hours ago.

&#x200B;

My body is whole again. My legs are back. I don’t have a mark on me… But I am mortal again. I can feel it… I can feel the change. My Godhood has been stripped from me. I do not think I could ever get it back.

&#x200B;

I realize that I am only alive right now, because the Gods showed me mercy… They disciplined me, and sent me back without that which fed my hubris. I’m sure some would say I should be thankful for that. But I disagree.

&#x200B;

This was not an act of mercy as one might think of mercy… In the right context, mercy can be the cruelest punishment. They knew what they were doing when they spared me. I don’t have a doubt in my mind that they knew exactly what they were doing.

&#x200B;

I have tasted Godhood… I have seen beyond the void. I cannot live the life I lived anymore. I will never sleep again, having seen the things I’ve seen. And having tasted true power, there is nothing I can do that will give my life purpose. 

&#x200B;

I have a pistol here with me now. This will be my final entry. I know that when I come to her for my judgment, Malibu will simply laugh at me, if she bothers with an audience at all. Perhaps I will be simply be cast into the Abyss to be devoured by Shaal.

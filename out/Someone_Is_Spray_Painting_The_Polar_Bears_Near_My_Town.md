I live in a small town called Churchill in northern Manitoba.

&#x200B;

It probably isn’t the nicest little town in the world. Winter gets cold as hell and with how remote we are, we get some problems with wildlife. But I guess the tourism isn’t that bad all things considered. During the busy season, we can see as many as 10,000 or so people passing through just to see the sights, although during the rest of the year, it’s quiet and that suits me just fine. I like the quiet. Nobody really causes trouble out here, which is good for me since I’m literally the sheriff around these parts. I get a handful of calls every few months about the odd dispute between residents. But there’s otherwise not much to write home about in that department. We don’t have a lot of people living out this way and everyone's spread pretty thin. Although even if everyone was packed together, the folks here really aren’t that inclined towards fighting each other. We’ve got a nice, tight knit little community out here.

&#x200B;

9 times out of 10, when I get a call it isn’t about the people in town. Hell it ain’t even about the tourists. It’s about what the tourists come to see.

&#x200B;

It’s about the bears.

&#x200B;

See, Churchill has something of a reputation as *‘The Polar Bear Capital of The World.’* There are a lot of bears that pass through this way during their annual migration and that can pose a bit of a problem. 

&#x200B;

You mostly see them late in the year, around October and November. People generally know better than to mess around with them but most everyone in town has their stories. Sometimes you’ll hear a noise outside and look out your window to see a bear looking right back in at you. A lot of folks around these parts are liable to leave their car doors unlocked in case anyone needs a quick hiding place in a pinch. Some people will tell you about coming face to face with one of them out on the street at night, and scaring it off with their phone. Then there are some folks who genuinely don’t give a rip about the bears. I’ve seen a couple of old timers stare them right in the eye as they walked past, daring them to make a move.

&#x200B;

Now, as I’m sure most people are aware, polar bears are pretty darn dangerous. All bears can be, really. But polar bears especially so. You cross a polar bear and that’s it. Say goodnight, buddy. That all said, I do consider us fairly lucky. There aren’t as many attacks as you might think. People are smart enough to know how to avoid conflicts with the bears and we do what we can to keep them out of the town.

&#x200B;

We set bear traps to lure them in and we’ve got an entire police force dedicated to dealing with them. We prefer not to kill the bears if we can avoid it. We just monitor them. We hit them with a dart full of telazol to knock them right out, and either move them safely out of town or down to the polar bear jail.

&#x200B;

I’ve met a few folks who think the concept of a polar bear jail is pretty funny… But honestly, it’s worked alright for us so far. We keep them there for about two to three weeks without food so they don’t associate us with a free meal. The bears don’t starve or anything. They can keep going for a while just off their stored fat. Then once they’ve either done their time or we need some space, we fly them out into the tundra on a helicopter. We tag them so we can tell if we run into them again, mark them with a green dot so anyone hunting them for their meat knows they’ve had drugs in their system. Then we let the bear go. 

&#x200B;

The idea is that the bear will remember the rough time we gave it and take care to avoid getting too close to town in the future. We get some repeat offenders, sure. But some of them seem to get the message.

&#x200B;

I wanna be clear about one thing… I don’t hate the bears. You don’t spend years dealing with them like I have without developing a certain respect and appreciation for them. They’re just animals. They only understand the fact that there’s food in town and that they’re hungry. Even when they attack and kill somebody, there’s no malice or anything in what they’re doing. Hunting and killing is just what they do and while I never want to see anyone get hurt by a bear, I can’t hate them for what’s just in their nature. 

&#x200B;

Truth be told… The best part of my job is probably bringing them back home into their natural habitat. I’ve got no illusions of the bears being thankful or anything. They don’t understand the why of what we do and hell, I imagine that through the haze of drugs in their system, they’re fantasizing about tearing me limb from bloody limb. But I’m still happy to see them go back to their lives and hopeful that I’ll never see them again. So when I see that someone or something might be hurting those bears… Well, that bothers me. It really, really bothers me.

&#x200B;

We saw our first numbered bear a couple of weeks back.

&#x200B;

We’d caught him in one of our traps by the garbage disposal site. You’ll find a lot of bears out that way. They smell the rotting food and they just come running. They can’t resist, so naturally I wasn’t that surprised to find a pissed off bear waiting for me in the trap.

&#x200B;

The traps we use consist of large steel cylinders with a grate on one end, and an open door on the other. We hang a piece of seal meat at the end of the tube and when the bear goes for it, the door slams shut.

&#x200B;

I could see the bear lying against the grate and I figured he’d been in there for a few hours. When he noticed me approaching I heard a thud from inside the cage followed by a frustrated huff. I could see the bear moving inside as it tried to follow me with its gaze through the grate. 

&#x200B;

I got in close to see if I could get a look at him. The grate was reinforced steel, so there wasn’t really any chance of the bear getting through.

&#x200B;

It was a little dark to get a really great look at him, but from what I could see he had an ear tag on. We’d probably met before. The bear took a step back before ramming itself against the grate and letting out another angry huff.

&#x200B;

  “Sorry buddy.” I said, “Can’t let you go wandering around out there though.”

I gave the side of the trap a reassuring pat, then set to work hitching it to my truck to haul it off. This angry customer had a cell waiting for him back in the bear jail. 

&#x200B;

Now, I didn’t get a real good look at the bear until we actually had him back at the jail. We released him into one of the holding cells and when I watched him step out of the trap, I immediately knew that something wasn’t right.

&#x200B;

For starters, the bear had a number spray painted right along his side. I hadn’t seen it while he’d been in the trap. It’d been too dark inside and I’d only really seen him from the front. But now it was impossible to miss. The number **54** was clear as day along his side. Now, that was certainly unusual, but I could’ve just explained it away as a marker from some research team to keep track of him. As I said before, we mark the bears ourselves when we release them so that anyone hunting them for their meat knows they’ve been drugged.

&#x200B;

The thing that concerned me was the way the bear moved… It was sluggish and jerky. I hadn’t darted it when it was in the trap, so unless someone else had drugged it, that obviously wasn’t normal. The poor thing looked almost ready to fall over, from the way it drunkenly shuffled around. It was oddly skinny too… We’ve seen bears over the past few years who couldn’t save up enough fat to get them through the summer months when the ice melts. But this didn’t look like that. The bear's body was thinner than it should’ve been, but its belly was really bloated. It kept shaking its head as if something was bothering it as it paced around the cage.

&#x200B;

  “That’s a weird looking one, no?” The question came from one of the guys who’d helped me get the bear into the cell, a fella named Taylor Niefer. Taylor was a good guy and he was probably about as big as a bear himself.

  “Yes it is…” I said, “Could be sick, maybe? Might need to call someone.”

  “Think we should we isolate it from the other bears?” Taylor suggested.

&#x200B;

  “He’s already in his own cage.” I said after a few moments, “If he’s got something it isn’t likely to spread. We’ll keep an eye on him though. What do you make of those numbers on his side? Who do you think left it with those?” 

Taylor just shook his head.

&#x200B;

  “I dunno.” He admitted, “I haven’t heard anything about a study being conducted in the area or anything. You’d think they’d give us a heads up. Think it’s got any connection to his condition?”

  “I dunno.” I said with a shrug, “Guess we’ll find out if we see more, I guess.”

  “Funny you should mention that…That ain’t the first numbered bear I’ve seen this week.”

I raised an eyebrow as I looked over at Taylor.

&#x200B;

  “No shitting? We’ve got another one?”

Taylor gestured for me to follow him and led me towards another cell.

  “He just came in the other day. Found him wandering around just outside of town. This one looks a little off too, but not quite as bad.” He said as we walked. 

&#x200B;

The cell in question was just a few down from the one I’d just deposited our new friend into. I took a look through the bars to see the bear in question lying down near the back of the cage. It glanced at us before going back to ignoring us. Sure enough, it was spray painted just like the one I’d brought in had been. The number **89** was printed bold on its side. The bear was panting and pretty clearly restless, but not quite as scrawny as the other one was.

&#x200B;

  “Oh and this one was a real stubborn bastard to bring in.” Taylor said, “He ran for the tundra. We had to get him from the helicopter. As soon as he saw it he ran for a nearby pond and started using the trees for cover.”

&#x200B;

You see the bears do that a lot. Usually with repeat offenders. They figure out that we can’t shoot them if they’re hiding under trees, and we won’t shoot them if they’re near water. If you shoot a bear, and it goes into the water, it’s probably not coming out before the drug kicks in and that bear is gonna drown. 

&#x200B;

  “By the time we got him, it took about three shots to get him down.”

  “Three?” I asked, looking over at Taylor. Usually one dart was enough to take down a bear. I’d never heard of a bear taking three before the drug got the better of him.

&#x200B;

  “You didn’t think you might kill him?” I asked.

  “We were worried about it. But we were following him for a while. First two darts barely had any effect… We hit him dead on too. Right between the neck and the shoulder. That should’ve taken him right down but he barely even seemed to slow. He was headed into town so we made a call. Turns out 3 was the magic number, I guess.”

  “Jesus… Any tags on him?” I asked.

  “No, this one's brand new.” 

&#x200B;

The bear huffed and stood up, pacing around the back of the cage restlessly. Taylor and I watched it for a few moments before leaving it be.

&#x200B;

From what I heard over the next week or so, our new resident, number 54 seemed fine despite how sick he seemed.

&#x200B;

I checked in on him a couple of times. He didn’t seem one to rest on his haunches and paced his cell constantly, clawing at the walls as if he was hoping to break them. When he did let himself rest, he seemed to flop down onto his side to avoid putting any pressure on his bloated belly. 

&#x200B;

Taylor had mentioned that one of the veterinarians we had on call had come in, but as far as I’d heard they hadn’t been able to figure out exactly what was wrong with the bear. For the most part, it seemed in excellent health. Their theory was that it hadn’t managed to store up enough fat last year and was suffering the effects of it now… A tragic case, but not something we’d never seen before. With less ice forming to support the bears hunting, feeding and storing fat becomes a lot harder for them. 

&#x200B;

At that point, we were in a sort of unspoken agreement that the bear would probably die if he went too long without food. I figured that they would either make an exception and feed the poor thing, or release it early to give it the chance to hunt. Personally, I was hoping they’d just opt to feed it… It seemed like the kinder option.

&#x200B;

I ran into our third numbered bear about a week after I met my first one. 

&#x200B;

There’d been a call that had come in about a bear sniffing around someones backyard one night. I was the closest so I drove off to see if I could either scare it off or catch it.

&#x200B;

When I pulled up to the house, I could see the pale white shape of a bear wandering around the side of the house, trying to peek in through the windows. Chances are he’d smelled something good in there and was curious. Judging by the mess of garbage in the backyard, he’d gotten into their trash and was still hungry.

&#x200B;

This bear was a big one, although a lot thinner than he ought to be. He wasn’t quite as thin as 54, but his stomach had a similar bloat to it. From the road, I could see the number spray painted on his side. ***29***. 

&#x200B;

I saw his head come up to look at me when he saw the headlights of my truck. He studied me for a few minutes before inching a little closer to the road to investigate. That seemed a little odd… Usually, the bears wanted nothing to do with us and kept their distance.

&#x200B;

I slowed my truck to a crawl as I loaded some blanks into my service revolver and hung it out the window before firing it up into the sky.

&#x200B;

*Crack, crack, crack.*

&#x200B;

The bear jumped back a little in surprise, eyes remaining on me. It seemed to hesitate for a moment before turning and jogging along the side of the house, headed towards a more heavily wooded area. The bear stopped just short of the treeline to look back at me, and stared at my truck as if waiting for me to make the next move.

&#x200B;

I fired three more blanks. The bear flinched but didn’t run this time. It almost seemed like he’d realized that the sound wasn’t actually a threat.

&#x200B;

I switched tactics. The terrain was smooth enough for me to get my truck up, so I veered into the people's yard. I hit my horn, blaring it to see if the bear wound run. It did and it didn’t. It turned and paced along the treeline, ducking behind the trees but not going much further. It was putting some distance between us but keeping me in its eyeline. The Bastard was probably just waiting to see if I’d follow him or go away…

&#x200B;

I honked again. The bear didn’t move. This one had some balls on him it seemed.

&#x200B;

I rested my foot on the brake and reached for the shotgun in my passenger seat. I loaded it with some firecracker rounds and hung the barrel out the window, shooting them up into the sky. The bear looked up at the burst of light high above my car and jogged a little further away, staying just behind the treeline the whole time. All he’d really done was end up on the other side of the yard…

&#x200B;

I fired off a few more firecracker shots. The bear watched them but didn’t run this time. For a moment, there was silence as the bear sized me up. Then, it slowly began to creep into the yard again, heading for the garbage it had been sifting through earlier, sniffing all the while.

&#x200B;

Little bastard…

&#x200B;

I’d never known a bear to be this brave. Usually, the blanks and the firecracker shells did the trick. 

&#x200B;

I blared my horn and lurched my truck forward. The bear looked up at me, before going back to the garbage.

&#x200B;

Bastard…

&#x200B;

I put the truck into park and reached into the back for my hunting rifle. I kept an eye on the bear as I loaded it up with a dart and moved the truck to get a better shot. This time the bear didn’t even look at me. 

&#x200B;

*Bastard.*

&#x200B;

I watched The Bastard sniff around for a bit and chew on something he’d fished off the ground as I lined up my shot. He wasn’t really moving so it was an easy shot to make, but it had to be perfect. You want to shoot a bear between the neck and the shoulder. The drug takes effect faster that way. Do it right and in about three minutes, that bear is down.

&#x200B;

Well, I had my shot and I took it. I hit that bear dead on. I knew I did. I’ve done it enough times.

&#x200B;

He jumped when he felt the dart hit him, and took off like a shot toward the trees. Seems like I’d finally gotten through to him. I watched him from the truck as he ducked behind the cover of the trees and turned to watch me again. For a couple of minutes… I stared back at him.

&#x200B;

He stood defiant, occasionally turning his head to gnash his teeth at the dart. But otherwise, he seemed just fine.

&#x200B;

I might’ve sworn under my breath as I started wondering if maybe I needed to take another shot. Taylor had mentioned that the other numbered bear he’d found had taken some punishment. Maybe another shot was worth it?

&#x200B;

I weighed my options for a few minutes as the bear started to pace. His movement seemed fine. He didn’t look sluggish or anything. He moved just like a healthy bear should. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, I figured that I’d take the risk. I loaded up another shot and took aim.

&#x200B;

The bear had calmed down from my first shot and was debating going back to the garbage. He stuck his head out of the trees and stared expectantly at me. I flashed my lights at him and watched him flinch, but he didn’t move. He was just *giving* me the perfect shot. So I took it.

&#x200B;

The dart hit the bear perfectly, just like the last one did. The Bastard jumped and took off back into the woods. This time, he seemed to get the message and vanished into the dark. I saw him heading over a small rocky outcrop before losing sight of him completely. I’d expected this… But I wasn’t exactly happy about it.  I’d have a hell of a time getting him out of those trees when the drug took effect… If the drug took effect.

&#x200B;

I mulled it over for a few moments before calling in some backup.

&#x200B;

I heard Taylor's voice over the radio replying to me:

  *“I’m on my way. See you soon, Rob.”*

  “Load in some live rounds.” I warned him, “This Bastards tricky… I don’t know if he’s down.”

  *“Stubborn, huh?”* Taylor asked.

  “Yup… And numbered. 29.”

&#x200B;

There was silence on the other end of the radio.

*“Live rounds then.”* Taylor finally repeated.

&#x200B;

About five to ten minutes later, I saw his headlights coming up the driveway as he pulled up close to me. He stepped out of his truck and loaded up his shotgun. I got out to greet him.

  “Another numbered bear, huh?” He asked, “He darted?”

  “Twice.” I said, “Dunno how well he handled the second dose. Guess we’re going to find out.”

Taylor laughed.

  “Maybe we’ll get lucky.” He said before gesturing for me to lead the way.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this is the most dangerous part of the job. When a darted bear runs off into somewhere, where you can’t get him out… You need to go in after him. I don’t like having to use live rounds on a bear. But in a situation like that where you’re out of the car and it's life or death, you need it. 

&#x200B;

Taylor and I stepped past the treeline, each of us with our guns at the ready. I gestured up toward the ridge I’d seen the bear go over and we figured we’d go around it and see if we could find any tracks.

&#x200B;

We found one better.

&#x200B;

The Bastard hadn’t gone far. He’d made it about fifteen feet before the drug seemed to have taken effect. As far as I could tell, he looked out. I called out to it.

&#x200B;

  “Bear!” 

The bear didn’t move.

&#x200B;

  “Bear!”

  “Bear!”

&#x200B;

Taylor was calling too now. Still no response from the bear. That was a good thing. We drew closer. The bear lay on its side. Its breathing looked awful heavy. I nudged it with my boot and stepped back. The bear didn’t react.

&#x200B;

Taylor heaved a sigh of relief.

  “Guess you got him.” He said. 

  “Guess I did.” I replied, “You wanna keep an eye on him? I can get a stretcher from my truck and we can haul him out of here.”

  “Yeah, you go on.” Taylor said, “I got him.”

&#x200B;

I nodded and turned away, heading back to the trucks and feeling some of the tension start to drain from me.

&#x200B;

Then I heard the gunshots.

&#x200B;

I turned around suddenly, just in time to see Taylor backing away from The Bastard as fast as he could. The bear was shakily pulling itself to its feet again. 

&#x200B;

I watched Taylor put three or four shells into it… I could see blood dribbling out of its wounds. But the Bastard didn’t even flinch. I raised my shotgun and took aim, firing at the bear from the side. But it just shrugged off the buckshot like it was nothing and charged full speed at Taylor… There wasn’t a damn thing I could do… There wasn’t a damn thing he could’ve done either.

&#x200B;

The bear hit him like a goddamn train, bringing its full weight down on him. I saw one final muzzle flash and heard Taylor scream before it closed its jaws around his head. I sprinted towards the bear, unloading three more rounds into its neck and side, hoping to God I could stop it.

&#x200B;

The buckshot should’ve killed it… I could see bloody, ragged holes in the bear's fur. Its distended belly had split open and pieces of it seemed to be hanging out. Taylors shotgun fired one last time, sending shotgun pellets through the bear's neck and head. Then I heard a sickening crunch as the bear's jaws cracked Taylor's skull and I knew that he was past saving.

&#x200B;

I took aim at the Bastard's head and fired my last rounds into it. I saw pieces of skull and brain matter torn off its head. I could see exposed bone on one side of its face. The Bastard just turned to look at me. He only had one good eye left… Half his face had been completely blown away leaving nothing but a gory, bloody, broken skull behind. Half his lower jaw was missing. 

&#x200B;

The Bastard shuffled away from Taylor and tried to come for me next. But its strength was failing it and fast. The bear's entrails spilled out of its split belly, leaving a trail behind it. Its legs wobbled as it lunged weakly toward me… Then they finally gave out beneath its weight.

&#x200B;

The Bastard hit the ground but it was somehow still breathing… Christ, the damn thing must’ve lost most of its blood but somehow it still seemed to be alive. I stared at it in this mix of awe and horror… I looked at its broken skull and I swear I could see something on it… Something I didn’t think had been there before.

&#x200B;

It almost looked like something was growing out of the bear's exposed brain… I swear to God it almost looked like some sort of mushroom. I hastily reloaded my shotgun before taking aim directly at the bear's exposed brain. It's one good eye watched me intently as I pulled the trigger.

&#x200B;

I fired three last shotgun shells into its skull and when I was done, there wasn’t much of a head left. The Bastard finally slumped to the ground. This time I was sure he wasn’t getting up.

&#x200B;

I ran to Taylors side, but I already knew that he was dead… The bear had damn near torn his head off. The most I could do for him was close his eyes. Then I went for my radio and I called for backup and an ambulance. 

&#x200B;

I’ve said before that I don’t blame the bears for what they are… I still didn’t. It hurt me to lose Taylor… He was a good man with a good family he’d left behind. But I didn’t blame the bear.

&#x200B;

The bear had a tag on him. We’d seen him a few times before. Hell, we’d seen him in the bear jail a few weeks prior. I’d been there when we released that bear!

&#x200B;

Three weeks ago it had been a normal bear. 

&#x200B;

Three weeks later and now…

&#x200B;

It hurt me to have to kill that bear, even after what it had done to Taylor… It was probably scared. Lashing out when wounded. That was all. I couldn’t hate it for that, even as much as parted of me wanted to.

&#x200B;

I went over the situation again and again in my mind, wondering if I should’ve darted the bear a third time. But that would’ve just risked killing it. I wondered if maybe I could’ve saved Taylor… But I’d watched him shoot that bear while it had gotten up. By rights, he should’ve killed it long before it got to him. But that bear just wouldn’t die. There was nothing more he could’ve done!

&#x200B;

I didn’t blame the bear. But I wondered if maybe I needed to blame whoever was numbering them.

&#x200B;

I heard a couple of days later that Bear 89 had damaged the concrete in his cage. Left unattended, he was likely to get out. The guys back at the jail had talked it over and decided to release him early.

&#x200B;

They’d tried drugging him, and just like before he hadn’t gone down. They’d darted him again and again until the bear finally collapsed… And when he did the drug killed him. It’d been a while since I’d heard of them overdosing a bear like that.

&#x200B;

I knew we’d only been having problems with these numbered bears… There was something about them. Something that was messing with them somehow. Making them more resistant to the drugs and more aggressive. 

&#x200B;

I’d asked about any researchers in the area. I’d heard nothing back.

So I figured I’d do some research of my own.

&#x200B;

I got a few days away from work on account of what had happened with Taylor. After taking the first couple to process everything and do some digging, I took the third day to head out into the tundra.

&#x200B;

I used my own personal Truck to head out there. I knew some of the safer, less bumpy routes and brought my radio with me just in case I ran into any trouble. I wasn’t really sure what I’d find.

&#x200B;

The Bastard had been released a few hundred kilometers outside of town. I figured that whatever had happened to him must’ve happened somewhere between where he was released and town… So I figured I’d head out in that direction and see what I could find. I drove for a couple of hours, passing a few landmarks I recognized from my past helicopter trips out there. I had to take some detours to get past some of the rougher terrain so my path wasn’t that clear… But I was getting there.

&#x200B;

After about two hours, I saw a numbered bear.

&#x200B;

This one was stalking the tundra, probably looking for food. It regarded me with a little bit of curiosity but otherwise kept its distance. On its side was the number **102.** It looked reasonably healthy. 

&#x200B;

I kept driving.

&#x200B;

I saw another numbered bear about a half hour later. This one bloated and sickly looking. Its number was **32.** Not too long after that, I found my first corpse. Number **11**. 

&#x200B;

I stopped to study it for a few minutes, staying in my car as I looked it over. Like a lot of the other bears, this one was skeletally thin and its stomach was bloated. Although there was something very different about this bear. It didn’t look like it had been dead long, but I could see stalks of pale brownish mushrooms poking up through its eyes and mouth. Some of the mushrooms even jutted out of its fur.

&#x200B;

I wondered what the hell had happened to it? 

&#x200B;

As I studied that bear, I caught movement out of the corner of my eye and looked over. 

&#x200B;

There was another truck driving through the tundra… A white Chevy with some official looking logo on it.

&#x200B;

***FRB***

&#x200B;

In the bed, I could see the shape of another dead bear. I figured that wasn’t a coincidence.

&#x200B;

I put my truck in gear and moved to follow it. 

&#x200B;

There aren’t a lot of places to hide in the tundra and there aren’t a lot of other cars out that way. I had no illusions of stealth. But I had to know where they were going. If the truck saw me, they clearly didn’t care. They just kept driving, eventually finding their way onto a dirt road that didn’t look like it had been there long.

&#x200B;

Up ahead, I could see the coastline and a collection of metal trailers right by the beach. That must’ve been where they were coming from…

&#x200B;

Looking around, I saw a bear staring warily toward the buildings. **114** tagged on its side.

&#x200B;

As I got closer to the trailers, I caught a few glimpses of whatever was behind them…There was something on the beach… The trailers weren’t that close to it and I couldn’t see it clearly. But I could see two or three bears gathered around it.

&#x200B;

The truck in front of me slowed to a stop near one of the trailers. As it did, I saw a man in a black coat stepping out of it. He was either of Korean or Japanese descent, with a top knot and stern eyes.   
 He didn’t even look at the truck that had just arrived. He was looking right at me.

&#x200B;

Guess this was the welcome wagon.

&#x200B;

I slowed my truck to a stop a few feet away and got out slowly, putting my hands up as a gesture that I meant no harm. The man just kept staring at me, his brow furrowed in a cold frustration.

  “This is a private research facility.” He said. He had a calm but commanding voice, “You’re trespassing. Get in your vehicle, turn around and go home.”

  “I’m with the Churchill Police.” I said, “I’m not looking for any trouble. My name’s Rob Barling. I’m just looking into some odd bears we’ve been seeing out our way. Bears tagged with numbers..”

I glanced at the corpse of the dead bear in the other truck. Number 17.

  “Know anything about that?”

&#x200B;

The man smiled and laughed softly.

  “We’re a long way from Churchill, Mr. Barling.” He said, “You don’t have jurisdiction here. Even if you did, what we’re doing is perfectly legal. So I’m afraid I’m going to have to insist that you leave.”

  “And just what the hell is it that you’re doing?” I asked.

&#x200B;

The man smiled but didn’t respond. I glanced past the trailers at whatever was on the beach. I still couldn’t see it clearly. Some sort of animal, perhaps? A beached whale or something but… No… It looked all wrong.

&#x200B;

  “This is a scientific outpost.” The man said, stepping dutifully to block my view of whatever was on the beach, “We’re researching the bears. Hence the need for tagging them. As for what we’re researching, I’m not at liberty to say. Now… If you’re done…”

  “The hell I am! You seen the state of these damn bears! Bloated, sick looking… Violent! I’ve got a friend lying cold in his grave right now because of whatever the hell you’re doing with these bears and I deserve a goddamn answer!”

&#x200B;

I took a step toward the man and as I did, he pulled a pistol from his holster and aimed it squre at my head.

  “Then unless you’d like to join your friend in the grave, you’ll stop testing my patience.” He said, his tone not even changing a little.

&#x200B;

  “Nobility, leave the goddamn man alone.” I heard another voice say.

A middle aged woman with long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail was stepping out of the trailer.

  “Put the gun away before you kill somebody.”

The man… Nobility just huffed before holstering his weapon.

&#x200B;

  “My apologies. My associate here is a little trigger happy. Research isn’t usually his department. So, you’re with the Churchill Police, right? I’m Director Amanda Spencer. I’m the Director of the FRB.”

  “Which is what, exactly?”

  “Classified.” She replied, reaching into her pocket for a cigarette. She looked me dead in the eye as she lit it.

&#x200B;

  “Look. I admire that you were willing to come all the way out here looking for answers. I wouldn’t mind some of that gusto in some of the guys working for me… But I hate to tell you that Nobility is right. We’re not obliged to share what’s going on out here with you. This is out of your jurisdiction.”

  “Well it ain’t anymore.” I said.

She laughed and took a drag on her cigarette. 

  “You’re funny…”

&#x200B;

  “I’m serious. Whatever the hell you’re doing to these bears it stops. Now.”

  “Whatever *we’re* doing to the bears?” She asked, raising an eyebrow. She looked back at the carcass on the beach. “The bears are doing it to themselves. We’re the ones trying to *fix* this.”

She turned to look at what was on the beach.

&#x200B;

  “But in order to fix it, we need to understand it… To understand it, we need specimens. We need to see how it affects them, we need to see how it’s affected by different variables. It’s a process. Not an easy one but it is a process.” 

  “And until you can fix it, you’re just gonna let these sick bears wander the tundra then?” I asked, “Because they’re wandering into people's backyards! Someone’s already dead!”

&#x200B;

  “And you have my condolences.” Spencer replied, “But what would you have us do instead? Shoot every single bear we think might’ve eaten something they shouldn’t have? There will be some that slip through the cracks anyways it spreads all the same only now, the bears aren’t conveniently marked for you. No… You may not like it. The methodology may be… Ugly. But it’s necessary that it be done this way.”

  “I don’t think I agree with that!” I said.

&#x200B;

Spencer took another drag on her cigarette.

  “Whether or not you agree isn’t relevant.”

With that, she turned away from me.

  “I’ve been very polite and given you much more information than I should. But you really should go. Whether you drive or Nobility drives is up to you. But we’re done here.”

&#x200B;

  “No, we aren’t!” I insisted. I tried to follow her as she walked away only to feel Nobility’s hand on my shoulder.

  “Yes we are.” He said softly.

&#x200B;

I felt the burn of a taser as he jammed it into my stomach. The next thing I knew I was falling… And that was it.

&#x200B;

I woke up in my own home that evening, my mouth dry and my body weak. My truck was parked out front. It was as if I’d never even left.

&#x200B;

But I knew I had.

&#x200B;

I know what I saw out there. I’ve tried to get in touch with a bunch of different people… But nobody’s listening. Whoever those people were, the ‘FRB’... They don’t give a damn about the people of Churchill. 

&#x200B;

Those sick bears are still coming into town. There’s nobody stopping them. One of my colleagues tells me there was a bear attack the other day… A man got torn apart walking home from work. He tells me he’s never seen anything like it. He tells me that a witness to the attack said that one of the bears had a number painted on its fur.

&#x200B;

It’s not going to stop. Nobody else is listening.

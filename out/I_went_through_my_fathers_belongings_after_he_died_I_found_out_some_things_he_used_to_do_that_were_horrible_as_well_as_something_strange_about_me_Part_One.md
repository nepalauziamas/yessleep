People always used to ask me, "What makes you special?" Usually, it was over the fact that I was given just about anything I wanted. Life was handed to me on a silver platter. At least, in the eyes of most.

Yes, I came from money. Yes, I lived a VERY nice house in a VERY nice place. And yes, I even was enrolled in the top tier schools growing up. I even had an account to my name with over $120,000 that I'd have immediate access to whenever I turned 18. So yes, I guess you could say I was blessed or "Special".

Of course, it didn't exactly *feel* that way. Money or no money, I wasn't without my own struggles personally. I may've always had more than enough to eat, never having to worry about where I'd lay my head at night in an alley or an overpass somewhere, sure, and don't get me wrong, I never tried to really flaunt my fortune in anyone's face, either. But, I wasn't without problems of my own.

The biggest of which, being my relationship with my father. Growing up, It was just me and him. I never knew my mother, dad never even so much as mentioning her in any sort of conversation, the few I can actually remember us having. My father worked as a biological researcher and chemist for the government at one of their research centers.

He'd be gone for most of the day back then, and sometimes wouldn't even come home until well into the next afternoon. This didn't bother me too much, though. I'd usually pass the time either painting in the art studio my father had set up in our house in an empty room, or in my own room, reading one of the innumerable novels on Celtic, Nordic, eastern, and many other folk legends and/or mythos. That was, of course, my favorite of the two pastimes.

I'd be lost for hours, imagining myself in those fantastical worlds; either rescuing a princess, slaying a mighty beast, or being granted some magical ability that elevated me beyond that of other people. Oftentimes, being as quiet as it was in the house during the day, my imagination would go so far as to cause me to conjure up some of these creatures who'd play with me. Of course, at the time, at least, I knew they weren't real, but it was still better to me than being alone every day. At night, too, when I'd lay in my bed, I'd hear them, calling out to me, telling me that they were there. that they'd always be there.

Unfortunately, this was also, for reasons I couldn't yet understand, a big thing that my father most disapproved of. I found this out when, one morning, when I was younger; about fourteen or fifteen at the time, I came into my room from school to find him in my room, holding one of my paintings with a look of absolute fear chiseled into his face. "What are these?" he asked, shaking.

"Th-They're my paintings, Dad..." I replied, confusion and anxiety mixing and causing my legs to quiver. His eyes further widened. I watched the olive complexion drain from his face, leaving him a ghoulish pale. "What's wrong with them?"

"Where did you see this?"

"Wha-"

"Where did you see this?!" he repeated, snapping at me.

"Th-they were from the books."

"What books?" I led him to the library and showed him. The apprehension on his face grew when I showed him the books. "Get out." he said coldly, "Get out, and don't ever let me find you in here again, do you understand?" I just stared blankly at him. "Get out!" this time, he shouted it. His voice echoed throughout the walls of the library, causing me to run out as fast I could.

I remember how rapidly my heart kept beating when I left the library and ran down the hall. My mind raced. Why was he so worked up over me reading those books? Why was it so wrong for me to be in there? *What was so wrong?*

I remember contemplating this for hours that day, sitting alone on my bed. I eventually came back out when I heard his footsteps stomping down the hall with a purposeful stride. His eyes were stitched open and bloodshot, looking almost wild like those of an animal. In his hands were a stack of the books from the fireplace. He went into the living room and set the fireplace before haphazardly throwing them in two at a time.

This caused me to run into the living room, screaming "Wait, don't! What are you doing?!" He paid me no attention, continuing to feed the flames like his life was somehow dependent on it. I ran over to try and save the rest of the books, only to be met with a hard shove by my father.  I was sent flat on my rear, him boring into me with a crazed look. I was so caught up in my own state of shock and fear that I couldn't really tell that he, in some fashion had the same look on his own face. There was *Something* that evidently frightened him about those books, or at least, about me reading them. Again, though, that context was all but lost on me.

I just sat there, helpless to whatever my father was going to do next. I expected him to wig out; to start throwing things around the room or to even hit me, *something*! Instead, he just continued staring at me in a state of fright all his own. Eventually, his face broke into tears, which in turn caused me to turn on the water works myself. He seized me and held me close, sobbing heavily. I was confused, but more than that, I was afraid. My head was spinning so quickly that all I could do was hang there in his arms, crying my own eyes out.

What was going on? What was dad so afraid of? Why was he afraid of me reading those books? His head pressed down into the top of mine, I could hear him mutter through sobs, "This is all my fault..." over and over again.

"What is?" I whimpered, wanting much more desperately for an explanation of some kind more than an apology. He never answered, though. Instead, he pulled away from me and made his way back into the library. I remained sitting still in front of the open fireplace. In front of me was only a handful of the stack of books he'd brought from the library. A part of me wanted to reach out and grab them, scurrying like a mouse back to my bedroom before Dad came back to burn them, too, but I didn't. No, I just sat and watched the ones that had been thrown in slowly turn to ash.

I fell asleep there that night and in the morning, I was awakened by my father roughly shaking me awake. "Wake up, start packing your things." he said in a voice that was hollow like the look on his face when he said it. I was confused.

"W-What's going on?" I asked, stirring awake. He didn't answer at first, instead moving toward the hallway and rolling two suitcases towards me. He wouldn't look at me. "Dad, what's going on, where're we going?"

"Pack your clothes, all of them. Pack up anything that's yours." My heart rate sped up, while at the same time sinking from my chest into my stomach. I may've been young,  but I knew what this meant. He was kicking me out. I stood, my knees shaking.

"What's going on, Dad, why do I have to--"

"NOW!" he snapped, now making eye contact with me again. He had that same face he did the night previous. It was empty, yet somehow sympathetic at the same time. I could see that, whatever the reason was, he didn't want to send me away any more than I wanted to leave. I swear I even saw a single tear streak it's way down his face. "Just..." he shuddered, wiping his face with his hand, "Just please, Joseph... Do as I say, and pack your things."

"Where am I going?"

"You're going to go stay with your Grandma Wendy for a while. She'll be by this evening to get you." He started back into the hallway towards the library.

"Wait!" I cried, "What about school? What about my friends?" He stopped and told me, numbly, dismissively, that he had that taken care of. I wanted to press further, to cry out and beg him to let me stay or at the very least tell me why I had to go. But I didn't. Before I'd even have the chance, I heard the door to the library close and I was alone in the living room.

Everything was quiet. Far too quiet; the way you'd expect from a place that was long abandoned. In a way, that's what the situation was; abandonment. No cause or reason given as to why or how long. Just doing away with life as I knew it. I can't really describe what I felt as I stood in the empty living room. I wanted to cry, sure. It was a frightening situation. But no, it wasn't fright I felt.

I wanted to scream, too. I wanted to punch, kick, and toss around everything around me that I could pick up and just wreck the place in a fit of confused hysteria, but I didn't do any of that, either. I guess the word I'm looking for is that I was "numb". So overclocked with confusion that my mind essentially had to reset like a computer, leaving me "numb". Hollow, like my father was.

This was how I would spend the rest of that day, absent mindedly stuffing everything of mine that I could get to fit into those two suitcases. It was around 6:00 that evening that Grandma Wendy came for me. I remember walking to the front door, taking one last look around the house. Still, empty, quiet. My father came out of the library carrying an armful of books that I knew he intended to burn when the doorbell rang.

Grandma Wendy greeted us with a smile. I can only wonder what she thought when she was received with grim expressions from the both of us. I was told to put my things in the car and wait there while they talked for a moment. By that point, I was beyond trying to figure out why everybody was trying to be so vague with what was going on. I just did as I was told.

I remember, though, taking one last look at Dad, silently pleading for him to change his mind. He just looked back at me with a mournful stare and nodded for me to go on. He didn't say anything to me, nor I to him. I just turned around and went to the car. For a while, I just sat there, lost, afraid, and just confused. No matter how hard I tried not to think about it, I just couldn't help but brood on the simple question of what had I done to deserve this? What did I do for my father to have to send me away?

I thought briefly about the story books, the fairytale collections, that he was so quick to destroy. I thought, too, of the way he reacted when he discovered my artwork based off of them. None of it made sense. I, try as hard as I damn well could, couldn't come up with any logical answer as to why my father was so adamantly against me reading them, against my enjoyment of fantasy. All of this continued to lead me back to the one central question, one that, only now, many years later, am I finally getting an answer for; what was I not being told?

As far as it went at the time, it was about thirty minutes later that Grandma Wendy came back to the car. I remember how she gave me a warm smile, sympathetic, silently telling me "It's gonna be okay now." I looked one last time at the house. My father stood on the porch, watching as we started away from the house. Only a few seconds later, we were on the highway on the 4-6 hour drive away to her house, ending the life I'd known for at least fourteen years.

Things changed drastically for me, of course. I no longer attended the prep school I did back home, instead having a tutor come to homeschool me (something that my father apparently arranged beforehand). As well as this, given that Grandma Wendy didn't come from money like my father, I had to learn how to make income for myself like everyone else. I guess what I'm saying is I wasn't "Special" anymore like how I said earlier.

Please understand, I'm not here to cry over that. I'm not saying that, because of that little paradigm shift, that life became a waking hell or anything like that. I was still able to live happily, even if I had to adjust to a new lifestyle. I grew up just fine, graduated (top of the class, even if I wasn't actually there), got a bachelor's degree in English Literature, and live in a very nice house of my own. Life went on, and I was still happy.

One thing stayed the same, though. Even if I could no longer read those books, I could still see them; the beings, the fairies, gods and goddesses from them. Even into adulthood, I'd still hear them, calling out to me. They'd tell me how they want me to join them in their realm. This, among anything else, proved to be my biggest predicament in life. I guess, given that I'd lived so long by that point away from the realm of childlike imagination, having to live normally, I realized that it wasn't exactly "natural", I guess you could say", that I was hearing the voices of fairies.

I'd been seeing a therapist for it for a while, and it'd helped a little. For the most part, with his help, I'd managed to see and hear them less and less; not completely gone, but not too much to really be problematic. His theory was that it was sort of my mind's way of "holding onto a piece of the past". He said that our minds, usually after something shocking or traumatic like that day at the house, will grab onto something happy as a sort of defense mechanism. In short, because I'd see the fairies when I was younger and had many fond memories of them, I would see and hear them now as a way of preserving the past.

This would ultimately become my way of accepting what I was experiencing. Not only that, but it was also how I'd make peace with what happened at the house, with what happened between me and my father. Until now, I'd never thought anything more of it. Then, last Tuesday happened, and I got the phone call.

After that day, I never actually saw my father again. He never called or wrote, either. The only word I'd ever receive from him was a birthday card in the mail, along with a check for $300 (at least, until my 21st, where it was a bottle of imported red wine instead). Outside of that, the old man basically didn't exist to me anymore. Hell, I won't lie, for a while, despite looking more and more just like him whenever I'd look in the mirror, I actually started to forget what he even looked like.

I guess, along with my memory of him, my anger towards him also faded into obscurity. It was early morning last Tuesday when I got the call that changed all of that. It was from an old colleague of his from the laboratory he worked from. My father's body was found hanging from the rafters in the library. He told me he'd been absent for almost a month and a half, having put in a letter of resignation, and went to check in with him. When he was found, it was clear he'd been dead at least three days.

I left the next afternoon back to my old home, having taken off a month from the office on paid leave. I arrived that evening where I was greeted by the colleague and a few other of my father's associates, as well as men in black suits. Legal consultants, I figured. Each of them briefly exchanged condolences before leaving. One of them; the one I spoke on the phone with, gave me a folded piece of paper before he left, telling me they found it with the body.

Once everyone was gone, It was dead silent again. Just like old times; no creaking, no tittering, no whir of air, nothing. Standing alone once again in the empty living room, the memories came back to me. All the fantastic adventures I used to have, the "Quests" I'd embark on; and with this, *they* came back as well. I could hear them, the soft, crooning voice of what I imagined to be a beautiful Goddess, *"There's nothing for you here, child... Come, it's time, my child."*

I shoved this down, though. Even if the voices *were* just a "preservation of memory", they weren't welcome in that moment. No, being there, in that living room, in that empty, silent house, only brought memories of loneliness; of abandonment. I looked over to the fireplace, a stack of books sitting in front of it. I went over and took a closer look at them. They were a mix of textbooks on biology, as well as a few on quantum physics and engineering, a few on philosophy and religion, and the rest were a couple of the mythology and folklore collections I used to read.

This prompted me to go into the library, where I then finally took out the piece of paper. Unfolding it, I saw that at the top of it was a paperclipped photo of him smiling with me cradled in his arms, asleep. This actually got to me for a moment, not because it was a heartfelt moment or because it was a "Happy memory of me and him together", but rather because of the fact that, for most of my life, even early on, he'd never been there. I guess that was another reason why it wasn't hard for me to all but forget about him when he sent me away.

Seeing that picture, though, I didn't know how to feel. Below the photo was, scribbled like he was in a hurry when he wrote it, was what looked to me like some sort of serial code. Because of the way it was written, I couldn't make out all of it. What I could read was "**MONOLITH D-1473 Proj Demi**". Under this was the following message, written almost just as illegibly;

*"There IS a god, and I only hope I can be forgiven for my sins. The file has everything, it tells of what I and the others did. It's in the black cabinet, second shelf, under "D" category. The time has come that I have to stop hiding and reveal the truth, to the world and to my son, Joseph. The things I did, I did for him. But now I must pay for my wrongdoings."*

I must've read that message almost a thousand times. Two main emotions hit me at the exact same time; confusion and anxiety. What was this "file"? Hell, what was this "Black cabinet"? In all the times past that I'd lingered in that room, even as big as it was, I'd never once seen any filing cabinets, black or otherwise. More importantly, what was it that file contained that apparently haunted my father, so much so that he eventually took his own life, and what did it have to do with me?

It was with these questions infesting my mind that I took to scouring the room, looking for the elusive black cabinet. I tore that entire room apart, top to bottom; tossing books around and eventually even resorting to toppling some of the shelves over to find it. It was only after, purely by accident, I had thrown aside one of the large brown encyclopedias on the second to last bookshelf that remained standing that I watched an area of the wall at the far end of the room -- ironically the space that used to be occupied with the fantasy books I used to read, by the way -- slide to the right, revealing a doorway to another room.

My eyes grew when I saw this. My heart jackhammered away at my ribcage. My knees threatened to buckle beneath me as I slowly approached the room. When I crossed the threshold, blinding fluorescent lights blinked to life, revealing a small, cramped office with a large mahogany desk in the center that had multiple stacks of manila folders as well as a few miscellaneous documents; some of which were laying discarded on the floor around it. Curiosity was replaced with a dreg of excitement as I glanced at the folders, seeing them marked with similar codes to what I'd seen on the note.

I knew then that, whatever this "file" was and whatever was in it, it would be found in that office. behind the desk were two filing cabinets, one white and the other being the black cabinet I was looking for. I rifled through the second shelf for about twenty seconds through all of the similarly labeled folders until finding the file labeled with the code written on the note. The front of it was marked with a small logo of a long structure or tower with the words **"Monolith site D-1473 secure file; Project Demigod -- classified data"** stamped across the front.

Immediately, I closed the drawer and sat down at the desk and opened the file. The first several documents were blueprints and diagrams for these weird contraptions that, honestly, I'd have no idea how to really describe. One notable thing about each of them, however, was that they were all labeled as being "Interdimensional compatible". Some of the diagrams depicted crude drawings of human-like figures, looking to be primarily female in nature upon closer examination, emerging through what I inferred to be a wormhole or portal or something along those lines. A doorway, in other words, to some world so far unknown to the world; that is, except for my father and the unknown persons that apparently assisted him on this.

As well as this, some depicted some sort of chamber or vessel evidently used for containment. These were noted as being made from solid steel and titanium. A bit more digging through the file and I was met with the first official document. It was an introductory note; detailing what "Project Demigod" was and their hypothesis. Attached is my transcription of this, and all of the report entries pertaining to the project. A quick note is that these are all undated, or at least, not that I could find, having been purposefully redacted, so it is unknown when exactly any of the events following occurred or the exact time span in between entries.

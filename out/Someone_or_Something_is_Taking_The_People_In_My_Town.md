This all started about a week ago, I was coming home from work and saw one of my co-workers walking around my neighborhood.
“Donaven? Hey man I didn’t know you lived around here.”
He flipped around but once he realized it was me he eased up and threw me a response. 
“Oh, hey man”
“How have you been? Haven’t seen you around the office in a while.”
“Yeah, sorry about that. Had a lot going on but I’ll be back soon.”
“you live around here?”
“yeah i’m on my way home right now”
I turned to point at my truck to ask if he wanted a ride home.
“well if you want-”

I stopped, where had he gone. He had just been there a moment before so why wasn’t he there now. I looked around and noticed someone staring, they looked, concerned? I waved and walked back to my truck. My thoughts were racing, what just happened? Where did he go? Did I imagine the whole thing? The ride home was silent, I didn't even turn the radio on. I was so lost in thought I almost didn't see it. In my rearview mirror, it was in my backseat? I flipped around and- nothing.
“fuck, maybe I am going crazy.”

I continued on my day like normal and not much happened. The next day came along and I was getting ready for work when I noticed my wife wasn't home. Had she gone out somewhere? Maybe she had plans and I just forgot. I brushed it off as my terrible memory and headed to work, I’ll ask her when I get home later on. 
I went to check in at the front desk of my job, but the secretary was gone? I rang the bell that sat on her desk but I got no response. Not even a shout from the back that someone would be with me momentarily. I left a note saying that I had arrived and if she needed me I'd be on floor 6 today. I got in the elevator and i was sure i pressed *6* but the floor was empty? Had I gone to the wrong floor? I turned to look at the elevator that clearly said 6, but I still had doubts. I walked back in and hit *7* maybe the numbers were messed up or out of order. Empty. 

Was there a holiday that I wasn't aware of? Maybe it was someone's birthday? I thought of Donavan, had what happened to him happen to everyone else? Panicking, I hit the ground floor button and I ran outside. There were cars on the road, but nobody was in them. Where did everyone go? I got in my car and drove, I called my wife but as expected, no answer. As I was driving I looked through store windows, every one, empty. 

I kept driving until I reached my house. That's when I saw it again. Second floor window, staring. I caught it, but only for a moment. What was it? I made a stupid mistake and got out of my truck and walking inside. I was going to find out what it was, I needed to know what it was. I walked inside and a horrid smell greeted me, like the house itself was rotting. I covered my nose and continued on. I heard what sounded like footsteps upstairs, stupidity I walked up. 

I wish I hadn't, because now I've barricaded myself in my bedroom. I don't know how long it will take, but that.. thing is breaking through. If anyone knows what's happening, please, what do I do? I thought about leaving through my window and making a break for my truck. But when I even step near the window, the banging stops, and it's outside. 

It looks like a human but its features are melted? Its face contorted and arms seem too long to be real. Its legs bend backwards at the knees, and it can turn its head a full 360° like an owl. It doesn’t move while I look at it, only its head. It twists, almost like it's observing me. 

It's been 3 days now, the banging has stopped but I know it's still out there. I'm thirsty, and hungry. My only chance is the window. But can I outrun it? Surely not, could I distract it with something else? That's it, I’ll throw something to the side of my house, and when it leaves to check, I'll run. I searched my draws for something heavy enough, nothing. The soap bottles. I pack my pillow case with soap bottles. Tossing it out the window i slide down the side of the house. i hear it behind me. I reach my truck and basically throw open the door. The door slams and I immediately look to my right. “holy shit.” It’s, what I assume is it’s, face is pressed against the glass of my passenger side window. I slide over the console and slam on the gas. 

I’ve been driving for days, stopping at gas stations occasionally. I know it’s following me, it has to be. I refuse to stop anywhere with the fear that whatever it did to the people in my small town, It’ll do again. I’m staying in a motel tonight because I can’t keep sleeping in my truck. 

I’ll keep you guys updated. for now, goodbye.

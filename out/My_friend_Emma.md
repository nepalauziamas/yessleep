Emma Bradbury was the first friend I remember making. We lived a few blocks away from each other and were in the same first grade class. On the first day of school, at recess, I saw her playing with some My Little Pony figures she’d brought. I asked if I could play with her, and she said yes. We had fun making the ponies gallop around and go on imaginary adventures. Soon we were best friends, and remained so all throughout elementary school. We played at each other’s houses every day after school, had sleepovers, wore matching costumes when trick-or-treating, and were both on the neighborhood swim team. We were both only children, and our parents often joked that they had two daughters, since we spent so much time together. My dad called Emma a “little sunflower”, because she had beautiful blonde hair and a bright smile and a laugh that was contagious. 

One sunny afternoon in early June, when I was nine years old, Emma and I were jumping on the trampoline in her backyard when her mom came outside, saying my dad was on the phone. My heart dropped into my stomach when I heard my dad on the other line talking in an uncharacteristically strained, high-pitched voice. 

“Brenna, get home, now. Mom’s had a heart attack.” 

I threw the phone down and leaped off the trampoline. Without even telling Emma or her mom what was going on, I rushed through the backyard gate and went racing through the streets to my house. I was crying as I ran, my tears being whisked away from my face by a gentle summer breeze. Mom had always had heart problems. She’d had a small heart attack when I was three, but had recovered quickly. I hoped this time would be the same. As I turned onto my street, I saw an ambulance in front of my house, its familiar red light flashing. Two men in uniforms were carrying my mother on a stretcher. She was laying very still, her skin as white as a ghost, her face covered by a giant plastic oxygen mask.  I ran up the driveway into my father’s arms. He held me and told me that it was going to be okay, that she was going to pull through. But somehow, I already knew she wouldn’t. We got into the car and followed the ambulance to the hospital. When we got there, a doctor told us that she’d been pronounced dead on the way there. 

Even though I remember that day very clearly, my memory of the funeral is blurry. All I remember is staring at a casket adorned with a wreath of yellow flowers—my mom’s favorite color—while everyone around me cried. Emma and her parents were there. She held my hand at the graveside service, as we watched the casket being lowered into the ground.  Neighbors brought me and my dad food and flowers, and stuffed animals for me. I told them thank you out of politeness, but I couldn’t feel any gratitude. I couldn’t feel any emotion at all—I was just numb. I spent most of my time shut in my room, lying on my bed and staring at the ceiling. I lost interest in everything. Emma tried to reach out to me, often inviting me over to play, but I ignored her. I didn’t go to any of our swim meets. I spent the rest of the summer in my room, either watching TV or crying. 

My dad also became very withdrawn after my mom died. Just a few weeks after it happened, he built a study in the basement. He sort of made a shrine for my mother in there, filling it with pictures upon pictures of her. He began working from home and hardly ever came out of the study, leaving me, a nine-year-old child, to grieve alone. Starting fourth grade was rough without my mother. Emma and I were in the same class again. I started hanging out with her again, as she was really supportive to me during that time. She sat next to me in class, being very gentle and patient. During free time, we would color, read, or play ponies together. My teacher was informed of what had happened and I was allowed to leave class to see the school counselor whenever I needed to. I enjoyed fourth grade for the most part, but I didn’t get as good grades as I had in the past, and sometimes during a lesson I would suddenly feel really sad and put my head down on my desk.

Christmas that year was pretty depressing. We had relatives over, but they mostly just sat around and cried. At some point I went up to my room and didn’t come out for the rest of the day. The following February, my birthday came, but my dad completely forgot about it. He didn’t get me a single present. A few weeks later, Emma surprised me with a huge, pink plush pony. She’d saved up her allowance to buy it for me. I named the pony Bubblegum and slept with her every night. I still have her to this day. I started spending a lot of time over at Emma’s house. I practically lived there. Her parents would often take us out to eat, or to the movies, knowing how lonely I was. Then, Emma found out about a local horseback riding place, and begged her parents to let her take lessons there. After much pestering, they gave in. I asked my dad if I could take lessons, too. He agreed to pay for them, but Emma’s parents always drove us. Being the horse and pony lover I was I immediately in love with horseback riding. It was a lot harder than I thought and gave me a good workout. I left each lesson tired, but happy and relieved of stress. Emma and I learned how to make the horses trot, canter, and jump over small hurdles. That summer, I participated in the swim team again. With those two sports to keep me busy, I started feeling like my old self again. 

It was that following October that Emma disappeared. I remember that day vividly. My dad shook me awake, as his alarm hadn’t gone off and therefore he hadn’t woken me up for school. Emma came to the house every day to meet me, and then we’d walk to the bus stop together, which was just down the street. I guessed we hadn’t heard her ring the doorbell that morning because we’d been asleep. My dad grumbled about having to drive me to school as he hurried me into his olive green pickup truck. I couldn’t remember the last time he had driven me somewhere. He said nothing during the drive, except “have a good day” when he dropped me off. I was in fifth grade now, and in a different class than Emma, but we still saw each other at recess. It was a beautiful autumn day. As we walked out onto the playground that afternoon, I breathed in the crisp air and awed at the bright orange leaves contrasting against the clear blue sky. I looked around for Emma, wanting to apologize for not answering the door that morning, but I didn’t see her anywhere. Guessing she was sick or something, I went to go play kickball with a group of kids. 

About an hour after I got home, my dad came into my room while talking on the phone. 

“Brenna?” he said, pulling the phone away from his ear for a second. “Did you see Emma today?” 

“No,” I replied. 

My dad swore and left the room. My stomach began to prickle with anxiety. I went downstairs and waited by the open door to the basement, hoping my dad would come back up and tell me what was going on. A few minutes later, he did. That had been Emma’s parents on the phone. She’d left for school that morning, but hadn’t come home, and the school had her marked as absent. Her parents called the police and an Amber alert was sent out. It interrupted the show I was watching to try and keep calm. Seeing Emma’s name scroll across the red ticker at the bottom of the screen made me tremble and break out into a cold sweat. I had seen a few Amber alerts before, but I never imagined I’d see one for my best friend. It was absolutely terrifying. 

The police talked with everyone in the neighborhood. No one had seen or heard anything suspicious that morning. I remember a friendly officer talking to me, asking me if I’d ever seen anyone strange following me and Emma, or if she’d ever played hooky. The parents of the neighborhood were understandably frightened. They all started walking with their kids to the bus stop, even if they were old enough to go by themselves, or they drove them to school. My dad didn’t bother to do either, saying the bus stop was much closer to our house than Emma’s and I’d be fine. But still, it really hurt me that he wasn’t worried about me like the other kids’ parents were. I wondered if he’d care at all if I disappeared. Our school had an assembly reviewing the rules of stranger danger. I thought it was kind of insulting to Emma—surely she was smart enough not to get into a stranger’s car…was she? 

Two months later, the police closed the case, as they still hadn’t found any leads as to what happened to Emma. They said they’d open the case again immediately if new information came in, but no information ever did. It was like she’d just suddenly been swallowed up by a black hole somewhere between her house and the bus stop. I didn’t go over to Emma’s house anymore—the atmosphere there was unbearable, with her mother constantly crying. My dad continued to ignore me. I sat in that lonely, dark house, angry at him for not caring about Emma and angry at Emma for just disappearing. My dad sent me to my grandparents’ place for Christmas. I don’t remember it at all—only that I was angry that Christmas was still happening when Emma was still missing. 

Middle school was hell without Emma. It was then that I realized she’d pretty much been my only friend ever. Many of the girls I’d known in elementary school became nasty, snotty bitches. I was quiet and often by myself, so they picked on me. I was often shoved in the hallways, told that my clothes were stupid, and had rumors spread about me. I tried hanging out with some of the other girls my age in my neighborhood, but I got the sense they didn’t actually like me, they just tolerated me. One night, I was at a slumber party at a girl named Britany’s house, which was just two doors down from mine. I heard her and her friends whisper about me when they thought I was asleep.

“Brenna’s so weird. She almost never talks. Why did you invite her, Britany?”

“I don’t know, my parents told me I should because she’s lonely or something.”

“Yeah, I think she’s messed up because of Emma disappearing.” 

“Emma probably ran away because Brenna was so boring.”

There were shocked gasps, followed by giggles. I pressed my face into my pillow as silent tears ran down my cheeks. I never hung out with those girls again. The bullying got even worse as I started my periods and acne broke out all over my face. No one wanted to sit with me at lunch because I was “gross.”  A boy even threw a milk carton at my head and the whole cafeteria laughed. One day, in study hall, I heard a very popular girl named Cassidy quietly talking with her friend at the desk behind me. 

“You know that ugly pimple girl sitting in front of us, Brenna?” 

“Yeah?”

“Wasn’t she best friends with Emma Bradbury?”

“The girl who disappeared? Yeah, she was. That was so bizarre. They still don’t know what happened to her.”

“I think it’s even more bizarre that Brenna actually had a friend,” Cassidy snorted. My heart sank into my stomach as her friend giggled. 

“Do you think Emma could still be alive?”

“Of course not—it’s been over a year. She’s probably rotting in some creepy guy’s crawlspace.” 

My body moved before I even knew what I was doing. I stood up, whirled around, and punched Cassidy right in the face. She let out a loud wail as she clamped her hands over her bloody nose. The teacher came running over and screamed at me to go to the office. I tried to explain to the principal that Cassidy had been saying horrible things about Emma, but he just shook his head and said “Violence isn’t the answer.” I was suspended for a week. My dad was called to come and pick me up. He snapped at me all the way home. 

“I was in the middle of a phone conference for work when your principal called me. Jesus Christ, Brenna, didn’t your mother and I teach you not to hit? This better not happen again.”

That was more words than he’d ever said to me since my mom’s death. When we got home, he marched back down into the basement and slammed the door. I went to my room and lay on my bed, feeling too empty to even cry. My life had become meaningless. No one loved me anymore. Suddenly, my hand brushed against something soft. It was Bubblegum, the big stuffed pony Emma had gotten me. A very dark thought crept into my mind. 

If I were dead, maybe I would see Emma again.

I lay there for several hours, holding Bubblegum against my chest, silently arguing with myself in my mind whether or not to do it. Around midnight, I’d made my decision. I crept down the hall to the bathroom and opened the medicine cabinet, looking through it until I found my dad’s sleeping pills. A warning on the back said never to take more than two at a time. I chugged the whole bottle. Returning to my room, I curled up again with Bubblegum, waiting for my consciousness to fade. 

Mom, Emma, I’ll see you soon, I said silently. 

Suddenly, a surge of vomit went shooting up my throat and sprayed my pillow. I coughed and choked, and then puked again. My stomach heaved in and out almost spasmodically, making me throw up again and again. Black dots danced at the ends of my vision, and then they were everywhere, casting me into darkness.

The first thing I saw when I woke up was these really bright lights. I wondered if I was in heaven. Squinting to adjust my eyes, florescent lights on a white ceiling came into view. I became aware of a steady beeping noise, and saw an IV in my arm. I was in the hospital. I heard a voice say my name, and turned my head to see my dad sitting by my bedside. When he saw that I was awake, he gathered me into his arms, holding me tightly and sobbing into my shoulder. His entire body was trembling. 

“Brenna…” he choked. “Why did you do that?”

“I wanted to see Mom,” I croaked.

“Oh honey,” said my dad thickly. “I’m so sorry. This is my fault. I’ve been a terrible father. I…I heard you throwing up in your room last night, and when I came in your face was blue. I called 911. Your heart almost stopped in the ambulance. I thought I was going to lose you the same way I lost your mother…”

I hugged my dad back, crying with him. All the resentment I’d built up towards him melted away in that moment. I had him back.

After recovering physically, I spent some time in a psychiatric ward. It wasn’t so bad. A lot of nice doctors talked to me and I met a lot of kids who were struggling like me. The day I came home, my dad ordered Chinese and rented a movie for us to watch together. He started making much more of an effort to be in my life. On weekdays he was busy with work, but every weekend he would take me somewhere, such as to get ice cream, to the movies, or to visit relatives. I remained friendless for the remainder of middle school, but having my dad back in my life helped get me through it.

Then, my freshman year of high school, I met Randy. We were assigned as lab partners in biology on the first day of class. As we looked at cells under a microscope per our teachers’ instructions, we got to talking. It turned out Randy didn’t have any friends either—he’d just moved here from Minnesota for his dad’s work. He was rather cute, with messy brown hair, freckles, and a goofy grin. I snickered when he pointed out that the cell we were looking at was rather phallic shaped. When our teacher told us to stain it with a blue dye, Randy whispered “blue balls” in my ear. I choked trying not to laugh out loud. Randy and I soon became best friends. It turned out his neighborhood was just about a 10 minute bike ride from mine. I started going over to his house a lot. He had a really lovely family and an adorable beagle named Skippy. Randy was a bit more outgoing than I was, and made friends with some of the other people in our biology class. By the end of freshman year, I finally had a friend group. We celebrated surviving our first year of high school with a party in Randy’s backyard, which had an above ground pool. Randy’s parents were really chill and let me spend the night a lot that summer. My dad had started spending a lot of time in his study again—although I was partially to blame for that because I’d been home a lot less since meeting Randy. Unlike most people, Randy was actually interested in my life and what I had to say. I could open up to him about anything. I talked to him about my troubled past, and he was incredibly supportive. His optimistic spirit gave me the hope I’d needed for so long. 

Randy and I started dating our senior year. Both of us really wanted to go to a university in Minneapolis, where Randy was from. It was only a few months before graduation that I realized I needed to talk to my dad about it. I went down to his study and cautiously knocked on the door—it had been quite a while since we’d had a full conversation together, so I felt a bit awkward. My dad told me to come in. I hadn’t seen the study in years, and didn’t really remember what it looked like. There was a book case, desk with a computer and printer, and along the rear wall were shelves filled with pictures of my mother. They startled me—I hadn’t looked at photos of her in years. I’d forgotten how beautiful she was. I sat down in a chair and talked to my father about the college I wanted to go to and the tuition costs. My dad agreed to pay for it. 

“I can’t believe you’re almost a college student now. You’ve grown up so fast,” he said with a smile. “Your mother would be proud.”

I nodded as one of the pictures caught my eye. It was of me, my mom, and Emma, back from when we were kids. All three of us were grinning brightly and sitting on a hayride. I was suddenly taken back to an autumn afternoon when I was seven. My mom had taken Emma and me to a country fair. We’d squealed over the ponies in the petting zoo and begged my mom to buy us caramel apples. I sighed and looked down at the floor.

“Emma should be graduating with me,” I said quietly.

“I know,” said my dad with a sigh. “I’m sorry they could never find her.”

“Have you heard anything about how her parents are doing?” I asked. 

“All I know is that they got divorced a few years ago,” he said. “I think her mother went to go live with family. Mrs. Jones, who lived next door to them, said that she just sort of faded away mentally after Emma disappeared.” 

I nodded sadly. 

“Well, who knows, maybe she’s still out there somewhere,” said my dad. 

“That’s what I’ve always hoped,” I whispered. 

My dad came to see me graduate. He waved at me from the audience as the principal handed me my diploma. I grinned and waved back. Randy’s parents rewarded us for graduating by taking us to the Grand Canyon that summer. I loved every minute of it. I hadn’t been on a vacation since my mom died. The canyon was breathtaking beautiful. One morning, Randy and I sat outside the cabin we’d rented and watched the sun come up, illuminating the ancient gorge in beautiful shades of red and gold. We shared a passionate kiss. We spent the rest of the summer preparing for college. We were so excited. I chose my major to be forensics. I wasn’t sure why, but I was drawn to it somehow. I think maybe a small part of it was because of Emma. I daydreamed of solving a mystery of a missing person to either save their life or give their family closure. 

College turned out to be just as amazing as I imagined. Randy and I moved into a cheap but nice-looking apartment on campus. Our friends were jealous of the pictures we sent them—they’d all gotten crappy dorm rooms at their colleges. My classes were pretty interesting, and I made friends with a few other students studying forensics. I sometimes thought back to that night years ago that I’d tried to end it all, and was so glad that I’d failed. I would have missed out on all of this.  

And then, one day, my world came crashing down. I saw the news while I was in class. It was some boring English class—one of those basic classes you’re required to have to graduate. I was looking at my phone under my desk, and decided to check CNN’s website for any interesting news. As soon as the page loaded, I saw the headline.

“Breaking News—Girl That Disappeared Eight Years Ago Found Dead” 

My heart turned into a block of ice. I told myself to stay calm—it could be any girl, Emma wasn’t the only one who had ever disappeared. I scrolled down the page to read the article. 

“The body of Emma Bradbury, who disappeared on October 9th of 2007 at the age of 10 in Greenstone, North Carolina, was discovered today after it fell out from under a tarp in the back of a pickup truck. The driver of the truck, unnamed for now, was later found and arrested by Greenstone police. He is still being questioned, but so far has confessed that the body is Bradbury’s. Her cause of death has not yet been determined, but officials believe that she has died within the past 24 hours.” 

I went running out of the classroom to the bathroom, where I dropped to my knees in front of a toilet and threw up. I gripped the edge of the seat with my cold, clammy hands, trembling violently. After a while, I managed to stand up and walk back to my apartment. I called Randy, who was about to go into class, but I needed him right then. He came rushing over, holding me in his arms and rocking me as I bawled into his chest. 

“Why did this have to happen?” I sobbed. “She should have gone to high school with us, she should be in college…” 

“I know,” Randy soothed. “But at least she isn’t suffering anymore.” He kissed the top of my head. He held me until I managed to calm myself down, and then went to class. I sat on the couch staring into space for a while, until finally mustering the courage to look at my phone for any updates. Suddenly, it started ringing. 

“Hello?” I said. 

“Is this Brenna Rodgers?” said a gruff voice on the other end. 

“Yes, this is her.”

“Miss Rodgers, this is the Greenstone Police Department. I’m afraid I have some news to inform you of.” 

I sat there, listening to the officer speak. I started shaking very, very hard. I could barely hold the phone. 

“No,” I whined in a tiny, childish voice. “No, please, tell me this isn’t true.” 

But it was true. Over the course of the next few days, I got all the details from the news and from the police. My father was facing charges of kidnapping, battery, and…..over a hundred counts of rape. He’d built the wall of the study with those shelves to be able to swing outwards, secured by a hidden latch. Behind it was a metal door with an electronic keypad lock. My father had built a tiny room, measuring 8x6, lined with concrete, with layers of insulating foam in the walls for soundproofing. On the morning of October 9th, 2007, my father had met Emma at the door of our house, telling her that I wanted to show her something inside. He then shut the door behind her and then knocked her out with a chloroform rag. He’d kept her in that cell for eight years, raping her on a daily basis. On the last night of her imprisonment, he’d left a plastic bag full of food for her, and the next morning, he found her with the bag tied around her head in an apparent suicide. The autopsy confirmed that she’d died from suffocation. 

I flew back to North Carolina. Randy went with me. We stayed with his family while I talked with the police. They showed me photos of the cell. It was so, so small. All that was in it was a cot with a pillow, a toilet, a sink, and a pile of books in the corner. Food wrappers were scattered all over the floor. A lengthy chain with a metal shackle on the end had been secured around her ankle, keeping her just within reach of the door. While I’d been making friends and going places, Emma had been beneath my feet, suffering unimaginably. My father had barely given her anything to do besides the books. I was honestly surprised that Emma hadn’t killed herself sooner. It had only taken a year after her disappearance for me to feel suicidal. She’d held out for eight years. She was always a much stronger person than I was. She’d been really optimistic, too--she must have had hope that she’d be rescued one day. But no one ever came. She was right in my house, the whole time, and I never knew. 

I went to Emma’s funeral, which was closed casket, thank god. According to the police reports, she barely resembled a person anymore. I wanted to remember her as the beautiful, smiling little girl I once knew. I didn’t say a word throughout the whole service. I just stiffly sat there, staring straight ahead. Her mother wasn’t there—she’d been admitted to a mental hospital after hearing about what happened to her little girl. As far as I know, she’s still there. I could sense that her family didn’t really want me at the funeral. Her father refused to talk to me or look me in the eye. It was like they all blamed me for never hearing or seeing something.

I talked to my father once, on the phone. I only said two words. 

“Dad. Why?” I had to know. 

“I’m sorry, Brenna,” he said, his voice flat and emotionless. “After your mother died, I needed someone to pleasure me. Emma was so beautiful. I just had to have her.” 

I went back to college and somehow managed to finish the semester. I took the next semester off. For weeks, I could barely get out of bed. My life didn’t feel real anymore—I felt like I was in some sort of bizarre movie. My father’s trial was cast live on TV. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole. There was a lot of public outrage that he didn’t get the death penalty, but I think that he should be made to sit there behind bars for years, to experience what he put Emma through. For some reason I felt like I needed to be punished, too. I was told by Randy, my therapist, friends, and family repeatedly that it wasn’t my fault. But she suffered in my house, at the hands of my father. I will never be able to live with that.

I’ve started attending classes again. Some days I manage to attend them, and some days I don’t. I barely talk anymore. I have outbursts of anger, and lash at everyone. My relationship with Randy is strained. I don’t know how much longer he’ll tolerate me. I hope he leaves—he deserves someone better than me. Every night, when I lay there sleeplessly, I see nothing but that fucking cell, that shackle on the wall, the metal door behind the pictures of my mother. How many nights did she lie awake, thinking everyone had forgotten about her? Well, I haven’t forgotten about you, Emma. I never have. I keep Bubblegum on my bed in memory of you. I’m going into forensics, and maybe even law, because of you. And I will never get over not being able to help you.

I stared at the black and white photograph illuminating my MacBook's screen. Then I looked up at my daughter. She was sitting across the dinner table, busily sketching in her colouring book with a crayon.

My eyes wandered across the laptop's bright, sleek screen again. I studied every detail of the photograph, burning the image into my memory. The tousled, coal-black hair. The doe eyes, the button nose. The beauty spot on the chin. The girl in the photograph was almost a perfect carbon copy of Freya.

Of course, it makes sense that one of my ancestors would share my daughter's facial features. But *still,* the resemblance was uncanny. The girl in the photograph and Freya were virtually twins.

The *girl* in question was apparently one of my great, great, great-aunts from my mom's side. I signed up to Ancestry.com earlier that day and it didn't take me long to find her in my family's archives. The *Lifestory* section under the photograph helped me to fill in the blanks.

&#x200B;

*When Anna Allison Seaver was born on 7th August 1872, in Tappahannock, Virginia, her mother, Lottie, was 17.*

*In 1877, Lottie was committed to Central State Mental Hospital (Petersburg, Virginia). Anna spent most of her childhood in Brookes Orphanage.*

&#x200B;

I scrolled further down the *Gallery* section. An assortment of old photographs popped up on the screen. Dozens of them. But nearly all the photos were from when Anna was young, no older than 11 or 12. There weren't even any photographs of her in her late teens or early twenties.

I found out the reason why when I discovered the death records.

&#x200B;

*Name: Anna Allison Seaver*

*Cause of death: Smoke inhalation*

*Date of death: 12th January 1883*

*A fire occurred on the night of 12 January 1883 at Brookes Orphanage in Roanoke, Virginia. 45 children and 3 adult employees died as a result.*

&#x200B;

I froze, feeling my heart sink. Chills tingled down my spine.

*12th of January.* That was the same day my daughter Freya was born.

Anna Seaver died on 12th January 1883. Freya's birthdate was 12th January 2012.

It's just a coincidence, I told myself, brushing aside that sense of unease I felt from the pit of my stomach. A disturbing coincidence - but, a coincidence, nonetheless.

I had yet to find out just how wrong I was.

I browsed through the old archives, unravelling the short story of Anna Seaver's life, one faded photograph at a time. I found myself lingering on one of the photos. It was a photo of all the children at Brookes Orphanage.

It looked like your typical class photo. The children in the front row were sitting down, and the ones in the back rows were standing. All of them had sombre faces, except for Anna. Anna was on the right corner of the front row. There was the faintest hint of a smile on her face. A feeling of unease washed over me when I saw that smile.

Honestly, I felt that same unease when I looked at all the other photos too. They were all equally as unsettling. Stare at each one long enough and you'd feel this suffocating darkness in the air around you.

A strange symbol reappeared in some of the photos. The symbol was of an X inside a hexagon.

The first time I saw the symbol was on the necklace Anna wore in one of her portraits. I saw the symbol again in the photograph where all the orphans were together; it was chiselled into the wall of the stone building that stood in the background.

What does it represent? I remember thinking to myself. I assumed it was just some type of emblem for the Brookes Orphanage organisation.

I spotted the symbol in a handful of other photos.

There was a picture of Anna and a boy sitting on a bench; stitched onto the boy's coat was a lapel pin, decorated with that symbol. There was another picture of Anna sitting on a rocking chair, posing with a doll; the wallpaper in the background had patterns of that symbol. You had to look *really* hard to see it.

My curiosity was nudging me, *inviting* me to discover more. I had to learn more about this Anna Seaver. I felt like she was a puzzle I had to piece together.

I wanted to spend more time researching. I could have spent hours scraping the bottom of Google's barrel for information, but Freya had school in the morning. And I had work.

I closed my laptop and called it a day.

"Freya, it's time for bed, sweetie. Why don't you finish up that drawing?"

"Just a second, mom," Freya chirruped, her black crayon scratching and dancing across the paper. "Nearly done. Just one more finishing touch. And *voila.*"

She sat back and admired her finished product with a smile. Freya had a smile that could light a candle. You couldn't help but smile when she smiled. It was contagious.

I approached her. "What masterpiece have you created for us today then, Da Vinci?"

"It's a surprise, mommy," she said, smiling mischievously as she pulled the paper to her chest. "Close your eyes."

I closed my eyes.

"Ok. You can open them now."

When I opened my eyes, I saw something that chased the sleep out of them. My eyes widened as I stared at my daughter's drawing.

It was a stickman drawing of her and me standing outside our house, with smiles on our faces. There was a big yellow sun in the sky. She even coloured the sky blue. It almost looked like a drawing you’d expect from a 10 years old child. *Almost.*

Crude symbols were scrawled all over the drawing in black crayon. They were the same symbols I found in those photos. An X inside a hexagon. I looked at Freya, trying to hide the concern from my face. "Freya, what does this mean?" I said, pointing at the symbols. "Why did you draw these symbols, dear?"

Freya stared at me for a moment, scrunching up her eyebrow as if she was turning the question over in her head. Finally, she just shrugged. "I... I'm not too sure, mommy. I guess I just liked the pattern."

Silence fell in around us. "Ok," I said, kissing her on the forehead. "Off you go, get to bed."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

As soon as Freya was fast asleep, I rushed off to my laptop and hightailed it to Google. I searched up Anna’s full name. I found search results on the dozens of Anna Seavers out there, but none of the results seemed to be related to an Anna *Allison* Seaver.

I searched up Brookes Orphanage. Apart from Ancestry.com, there seemed to be no trace of the orphanage on the Internet. My last resort was to search for that symbol. The X in a hexagon symbol.

I discovered this website, a discussion forum, where you can submit requests for people to find the meaning of symbols for you. I sent screenshots of that symbol on to the forum. The responses flooded in. One of the responses raised the hair on the back of my neck.

&#x200B;

*Hey OP, I’ve come across that symbol before. I saw it in this book I read back in college.*

*If I remember correctly, that looks like one of the cryptic letters used by the No Eyes.*

*No Eyes was a satanic cult that used to be active in the late 1800s/early-1900s. As the story goes, their members were trying to find ways to achieve immortality. To live forever by inhabiting new bodies and letting their spirits “pass” through their descendants.*

*Of course, take all of that with a grain of salt. A large part of their story is probably myth.*

*There’s not a great deal of information on them out there.*

*I’ll try and find that book for you.*

*Hope this helped.*

I sat there, staring at my laptop screen, lost for words. And at that moment, a realization slowly washed over me.

It was the realization that the girl sleeping upstairs might not be my daughter. But something else entirely.

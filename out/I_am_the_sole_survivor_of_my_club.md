 

I am the sole survivor of my club. It all started when me and a few friends of mine got into the occult, we had liked things like horror since we were kids so it didn’t surprise anyone when my girlfriend, Shaelyn had brought it up. Me and my childhood pal Connor were skeptical at first but decided to see why Shaelyn liked the idea so much. We had started reading books and looking at stuff online when we found out our highschool we were going to allow clubs, so we started a horror club which was mostly Connors idea making him the club leader. But Shaelyn decided to be a freelancer, she came to club meetings but had no interest in joining, soon she came less and less till I realized she wasn’t even coming to school anymore.

I decided to check up on her, make sure she was fine. When I went to her house the door was unlocked, the place had all her family's stuff but was completely abandoned. I went upstairs and went to the 3rd door on the left, her room, and that's when I saw something that haunts me till this day, Shaelyn, skinny and starved, was eating away at her fathers remains. I ran as fast as I could before she could notice me and called Connor, “Listen man, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but I just witnessed a thing eating my girlfriend's father!” At that time I didn’t know that the “thing” was my girlfriend, Connor calmed me down and said that he would go with me the next day to see what I saw.

The next day came, me and Connor had gone back to that house, everything looked brand new and when going up to Shaelyn’s room it was completely clean, no blood, no Shaelyn. Shaelyn had started coming back to school after that, she looked normal, and didn’t seem to know what I meant whenever I brought up the situation, she was completely oblivious, or at least I thought.  
 She had broken up with me after that, me and Connor stopped being friends due to him getting with her, but then a few weeks after they got together Connor had vanished, slowly I noticed more and more of the boys in our highschool also vanished, but none of the girls did. One day a girl by the name of Sarah tried to hit on me, I ignored it but then she also went missing. I thought it had something to do with Shaelyn’s house so I went back, once again it was like the day I saw the creature eat Shaelyn’s father, I went up to the 3rd door on the left, and saw Shaelyn sitting there covered in blood, “There you are Angel, I was wondering when you’d put the pieces together you fucking detective”. I had looked at her in disgust but then she explained, “It all started the day I got into the occult, I had started learning things about demons and ghouls, then I finally did it, I summoned something, that something drained me of blood. I had stood in my room for weeks until my father came in, and I drained his blood, I knew you walked in and was too bored to chase you”

“So you knew, I wasn’t crazy, I’ve been trying to tell other club members but they haven’t believed me, it caused me to get outcasted and soon voted out by the members, but I was right, you’re a vampire!” She had confirmed my theory and stated that if I let her, she would take care of those who outcast me, with the price of becoming a food source, letting her take a small amount of my blood every few days.

Soon all those who outcasted me disappeared, and finally I was reunited with my lover, and that is how I became the sole survivor of my club.

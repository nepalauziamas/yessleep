**A Humble Invitation**

That was the subject of the email, which seemed harmless enough. It was from a man named Johan Weber, who claimed to be the curator for the Beethoven museum in Vienna. A quick Google search confirmed his claim.

To give you an idea of who I am, my parents are both traveling classical pianists (perhaps the only two remaining classical pianists), and they had me hitting the keys before I could even walk; reading music before I could read English. 

I don't know, and psychologists would probably disagree, if it was more nature or nurture that lead to my talent. But either way, it sprouted fast. By eight I had taken over my parents act and was headlining their church and nursing home shows. 

By twelve, word had got around about the prodigy (or the "Baby Beethoven" as one New Yorker article claimed), and my act got bumped up to theaters. 

Four years after that, I had finally perfected *Flight of the Bumblebee,* of of the most difficult piano pieces ever written, and performed it in front of a sold out theater in Omaha, Nebraska. 

Phones weren't supposed to be permitted in the concert hall, but in a dark twist of fate, someone managed to get one in and recorded my performance. A day later it was posted, a day after that I was viral. 

The email from Mr. Weber goes on to list many facts and anecdotes about Beethoven, his life and his work; I'll spare you the details. The important part came when he mentioned seeing my viral video online, as well as seeking out my subsequent videos, and told me he was astonished. He had dedicated his entire life to Beethoven, and apparently I'm the only person he's ever seen that's equal to Beethoven in pure talent (he probably just reads the New Yorker). I'd have to disagree, but I appreciated the compliment.

Anyway, he concluded the email by offering to fly my parents and I out to Vienna to see the museum, and so he can hear me play in person. I responded that I appreciated the generous offer, but I didn't think we'd be able to make it.

He responded almost instantly and upped the ante. He said he would even let us stay in Beethoven's actual home. I mean, I'm not the biggest fan of Beethoven, but c'mon.

My parents didn't need much convincing, and within a week we were boarding a jet (business class of course, this is the Beethoven museum, not the Louvre) and on our way to Austria.

Mr. Weber met us at the gate, and he looked nothing like I imagined he would. He was short and stocky with auburn hair and dark brown, almost black eyes. For some reason I was expecting a Dolph Lundgren type.

After the over-complimentary introductions, he took us to where we would be staying - The Beethoven House. Since Beethoven never married or had children, the house became property of the Austrian government after his death, and since he was such a prominent figure, they deemed it a "historical property" and barred anyone from ever living there again.

That meant, as Mr. Weber put it, we were maybe the first people to spend a night there since Beethoven himself. This was supposed to be an honor, but for some reason I found it unnerving.

Beethoven's last home was a cozy little cottage on the outskirts of Vienna, and it almost kind of reminded me of Bilbo's house in *Lord of the Rings".* Except, of course, for the grand piano that sat imposingly in the living room. Normally everything is roped off for the tourists, Weber explains, but he removed them for our stay. We were, as he says, "free to explore the wonders of Beethoven", though we were encouraged to be careful.

Shortly after showing us around and feeding us authentic Germany food that he brought over, his mother's recipe he claims, he left us. Alone in a dead man's home.

Due to the time difference between midwestern America and Vienna, I had a had a hard time sleeping the first night. I tossed and turned until two in the morning, and the intrusive thoughts that maybe, just maybe, Beethoven had died in this very bed didn't help me any. After a while I just couldn't stand it anymore, so I got up to have a better look around.

I tiptoed past my parent's room, but I could hear my dad's thunderous snoring, so I knew they were asleep.

Tossing and turning for hours really worked up my appetite, so I went to the kitchen for a snack. Nothing. Literally nothing, the fridge and cabinets were completely for show. At least the sink worked so I could drink some water, though I had to cup it in my hands like someone lost in the woods that finally finds a stream, because there weren't even cups.

A little annoyed, I made my way into the living room, though it was more like a shrine to the dead piano player. There was a bookshelf full of biographies, books on music theory and books detailing the profound impact that Beethoven had on the musical renaissance.

I flipped through a couple, careful not to damage any of them, but towards the bottom I found something far more interesting: sheet music. Clearly there weren't any originals, as those would be far too valuable to keep in the reach of just any inquisitive child, but I still immediately gravitated towards them. 

There was a beauty in them that I hadn't found in any sheet music I had read previously. But it almost felt like a dark beauty. A dark art created by a man tortured by his own genius. Music is it's own language, and some of these pieces felt less like inspired creation, and more like a necessary expungement of thought from deep inside Beethoven's mind. As I was reading, a sense of dread started creeping up through my subconscious until it became palpable.

As though guided by a supernatural force, after reading a piece I found particularly haunting, I drifted with it over to the Grand in the center of the room. In this current state, the Grand Piano had lost it's magnificence, and I now found it terrifying.

I sat down, set the sheet music on it's stand, and rested my hands just above the keys. They hovered there, they knew what notes to play, but my mind couldn't make them start. I told myself it was because it was late and I didn't want to wake anyone up, but that wasn't true. The truth was that I was scared of the power this music held over me.

It was almost like the music itself was... *alive.*

Slowly, the force that inhabited the space moved my right hand down, and my middle finger touched the key, just as I was about press down:

"Michael?" my still half-asleep mother called from behind me.

I jumped almost completely out of the seat, and when I did my knee smashed into the bottom of the piano, jarring it and kicking up dust. I sat breathless as I looked it over to make sure I hadn't done any real damage. Then, I turned to my mother, whose eyes were now wide with the same apprehension.

"What are you doing?" she asked.

"I... I couldn't sleep" I muttered, "I just wanted to come check some of this stuff out."

"Well, go to bed," she sighed "and for the love of God, do not break Beethoven's piano."

I agreed with a nod, and slowly got up, leaving the sheet music where it sat. I was scared to even touch it again. As I was turning to leave though, I noticed something I hadn't seen before. I intended to pay it no mind, but it seemed to call to me, and I couldn't leave the room without a closer look.

In the guts of the piano, I saw what looked to be a small piece of fabric. As I got closer to it, I realized that it was several very old sheets of paper, folded together. I tried to pull on it, but it was stuffed in good. And after a few seconds of firm but careful jimmying, I was able to pull them free.

I was sure to be gentle in unfolding this paper, browned through time and covered in dust. I lost my breath when I finally unfolded it and saw what it was:

**Sheet Music.**

On the top was written "Die verfluchte Symphonie". I don't speak German, but I was able to make the simple translation of symphonie to symphony. My inability to read German ultimately proved disastrous, because I later translated this to read "The Cursed Symphony".

I looked towards the entrance of the hallway my mother had just appeared from, and she had already gone. Then I looked back down to the sheet music in my hand and realized my hand was shaking violently, so much so that it made the music itself hard to read.

I finally got control of myself, although the sheer magnitude of my terror was unsettling. *Why was I so scared?* I told myself it was the jolt of hearing my mother's voice out of the darkness when I least expected, but deep down, I knew better.

I got control of my hands and started reading through the music. If the previous pieces I had read were the merciful escape of ideation from the mind of a tortured genius, this piece was the culmination of his final slip into madness. Even just reading this sheet music caused a guttural, instinctual reaction in me. Full blown fight or flight: heart pounding, sharp, choppy breaths.

I noticed something in the top corner that I hadn't before. Handwritten and clearly shakier than the also handwritten music, was signed the name "Ludwig." Next to it was the date: "23 Marsch, 1827." Not only was I holding an actual, likely priceless original work, written by Beethoven himself, but it was a piece that was written just three days before he died.

Again compelled by a force unknown to me, I sat back at the piano. Set the music up, the violent shaking in my hands returning. I knew the first chord. I had never played it before, but I knew it. I could hear it without touching the keys. My hands hovered over the correct keys, but wouldn't press down. It was my final subconscious fight against what was to come.

I lost the fight. My right hand eventually descended, and played. In the key of A minor, the keys of A - C  - E - and F rang out in the dark. You may recognize this little riff, as it is used in many movies these days to signal danger and impending doom. Somehow Beethoven dug this riff up back in the early 1800s like a cursed archaeologist. And that was just the beginning.

After that my hands fluttered over the keys, playing a haunting tune. I broke out in a cold sweat. I kept periodically looking back to the hallway, certain my mom would come back soon, whisper yelling at me to "knock it off", putting an end to this unholy performance.

As I sit here writing this to you guys, I can still here the song, the whole song, all at once. But I can't for the life of me find the right words to describe it. The best I can come up with is that this final, cursed symphony, one that was never intended to see the light of day, is a lullaby from the deep. A pitch-black siren song that not only brought tears to my eyes as I finished the first page and turned to the second, but also seemed to ooze out some sort of *physical* quality. Like the room was being filled with a malicious jelly, completely devoid of light.

It was awful, but I couldn't stop. And somehow I knew that the mere utterance of this song into the physical universe was akin to a satanic ritual, designed to free the dark angels from whatever nonphysical prison they were contained to. I was opening a portal, and I could feel the Reaper's cool hand on my shoulder.

And just like that, I played the final note. I wiped the tears from my eyes and simply got up. The shaking had returned with a vengeance, but I was able to stuff the sheet music back in it's original, unseen-for-centuries place. Thinking back, I'm not sure why I did that; why I didn't tell someone, expose it, or even try smuggle it home and sell it. 

*Or burn it.* 

My dreams that night were filled with the same black mass that seemed to separate itself from the music. I didn't exactly dream, I just sat engulfed in pitch black, with the sickening feeling that someone, or *something* was there with me. 

I woke up this morning drenched in sweat with a scream. I was filled with the certainty that what I had done (what I had *released*) last night could not be undone. Could not be put back in it's figurative "bottle". So, I'm writing this to all of you. Not only to to get it all down to see how crazy it really sounds, but also as proof that if something happens to me, I didn't do it to myself. 

Pray for me guys, and I'll keep you updated.

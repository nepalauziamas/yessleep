I was having a good day with my friends in the summer holidays, we were in a basketball camp with my basketball team, then it was time to go to sleep.
 
As me i fall asleep in about 30 minutes or an hour, which is boring, i watched my phone with my other roommate for about 20 minutes some funny videoto relax tfor better sleep, we got bored and went to sleep, and this is where the terror begins...

I hear footsteps, they were loud because it waked me up,  i thought my roommate was getting some water or something, i ignored it for some time but the footsteps got even louder so i turned around to check what it was, i turned and i saw my roommate sleeping which was creepy, how was there footsteps when he is literally sleeping, i went to sleep again but i couldnt because the footsteps continued louder and louder...

I turn around again and saw this person full pain black no eyes no face, walking around the room in circles, i was terrified full in sweat, i wake up and went to my roommate and asked "Do you not see this fucking person?" He replied "Go back to sleep because you are not funny and not letting me sleep" i was shivering full in sweat in the bed because i was scared as hell, even to move a single bit later i turn to my wall and close my eyes and the footsteps stopped but i hear very loud breathing to my left ear...

I turn around again to see the person was standing right next my bed, staring at me with no eyes, i got out of my bed and ran to the toilet and locked my self in the toilet because i was full in sweat, i did a reality check to see if im dreaming or no i was not dreaming and this caused more panic to me, i stayed in the toilet for solid 5 minutes and went again to my room the person was gone  "Okay everything is fine" and went to sleep i checked the time it was 2am... 

After that i heard a voice "Wake up Julius" Julius is my name and how the hell did he know my name, i look around again and he was just staring at me again for like 10 minutes and shaking, twitching, then he dissapered with saying "Goodnight"  after i went to sleep again then i hear footsteps again and saw the person walking down the stairs, i went back to sleep again with panic and stress...

This left me in shock for days i never came back to the camp, i was thinking about the night the other whole day, i think i was hallucinating but why i never even hallucinated in my life this stuff like this seeing a person walk around with no face, and eyes, i even remember to this day even it was 3 years ago does someone know what happend to me?...

To avoid any legal ramifications, I've replaced any references to the company running the beta test with COMPANY.

"You've been chosen: Based on your usage patterns, we have identified you as an ideal candidate for the pre-Beta release of our new xSR feature set."

The email almost looked like spam, except it came directly from an "@COMPANY.com" account.

"xSR is the next generation of Smart Reply, which analyzes your messaging and online behaviors to help streamline your day-to-day communication."

I'm not sure if anyone here uses Smart Reply, but it's that thing on Android, LinkedIn, Outlook, Slack, and Gmail that pops up offering suggestions of quick replies. Usually something like:

"Me too!",
"I'll call you back",
"That's great!", or
"Okay"

To say that Smart Reply could "streamline my day-to-day communication" was laughable.

I had played a game one time with a friends where we could only reply with the Smart Reply options. We would see how ridiculous the conversation could get. We mostly just got caught in loops.

"What's up?"
"Not much, you?"
"Not much, you?"
And so on.

I guess those games had landed me on COMPANY's "ideal candidate" radar.

The email was vague regarding _how_ my life would be improved by xSR, but said it could:

"Ensure you stay on top of my personal and business communication by shortening time spent typing, finding the right words for difficult situations, and reminding you about regular conversations."

Sounded basically like the regular Smart Reply, but why not? I opted in.

I received a link to download an update to my phone. When I restarted, the screen went purple and "Welcome to xSR" popped up, with a terms and conditions checkbox. I checked without reading, of course, and continued.

My phone informed me that it would need a few minutes to analyze my historical data.

While I stared at the loading bar, I remembered an episode of Black Mirror where a lady tries to resurrect her dead husband with an AI trained off of his tweets or something. This felt oddly like that. Something just felt wrong about it.

The loading bar completed and a little green checkmark flashed on the screen with an "All Done!" below it. I wondered how much data it could have possibly analyzed in five or six minutes and clicked continue.

This time I actually read the message.

"Your AI model is trained! The model will silently evaluate itself over the next week based on your communication. You should start seeing recommendations within a few days. Congratulations on taking the first step towards a more efficient you!"

I was admittedly upset that I had to wait a few days for it to start. Part of me was planning to click around with it a bit and maybe try to revert the download afterwards.

My first recommendation came 5 days later.

"You usually message Jordan around this time." Came up in my notifications. There were two message options, a text box to write my own message if I wanted, and the option to dismiss the notification.

This was actually pretty cool. I picked one of the algorithm's options, and it turned green when I clicked it.

"Hey man, want to meet up for some üèÄ?" The message said.

"Can't. I have to study tonight. Big exam tomorrow." He replied

I opened his message, and there was a pre-filled response I could click on: "Okay, good luck on the exam". I clicked and stated to type "Lame"

The suggestion updated to "Lame. You'll do fine on your exam. Come on let's üèÄüèÄüèÄüèÄ"

This was actually really cool.

Jordan and I did end up shooting some hoops that night, and he definitely flunked his exam the next day.

When I got home, I had another notification: "you got your first suggestion today. Tell us how it was." I actually did the little review. COMPANY had outdone themselves on this one.

The features got even more advanced from there.

I set it up to auto-reply to my mom when she asked what I was doing. It could pull info from my calendar, location, and other messages to give an accurate response.

There was an option to configure a voice model, which it could use to manage calls, and I would get a transcript and recording afterwards.

It even sorted my email based on my usage patterns and gave me a "daily digest" of important emails, with options for automatic responses.

The initial email had sounded funny at first, but now it seemed like COMPANY had undersold it.

Then the weird suggestions started happening.

One day it suggested I send a text message to a random phone number that I didn't have saved.

"Hey, it's Jimmy from calculus. You want to meet up?"

I checked, but I had no message history with the number. I guessed maybe it was a glitch. I had probably sent a message to an unsaved number before, and the AI was somehow seeing a pattern. I was in pre-Beta after all.

I tried sending the message anyway for a laugh.

"Oh my gosh, Jimmy! How'd you get my number? Leah and I were just talking about you!"

Weird. I went with the suggestion.

"I meant to ask you for it in person, but I forgot after the midterm. Clara gave me it. Let's get smoothies!"

I don't understand how, but this was Monique, a girl from my calculus clash I had been crushing on all semester. Somehow my phone had managed to get me the date with her I had been wanting. The pleasant surprise of it was enough for me to forget about being put off by the circumstances.

I did check later, and I didn't have a message history with Clara.

I completely struck out on the date because the phone wasn't giving me suggestions in person. I wrote that in my review.

Another time, I saw a suggested message to my friend saying:

"Hey, I heard your mom is in the hospital. Is she doing okay? I'm here for you if you need anything‚Ä¶"

Although I had no idea his mom was in the hospital. I thought maybe the algorithm was keeping an eye on social media or news and lacing it back into my contacts.

Kind of creepy, but still explainable.

This past week, though, everything has gone to shit.

I received another email last Sunday from COMPANY stating "Beta release has been delayed due to unforeseen circumstances", "unfortunately we do not yet have a way to deactivate xSR on linked phones or COMPANY accounts," and "please contact us if you have any cause for concern."

The following day, I happened to see a message between myself and an international number I didn't have saved. The messages were all in Russian.

I copied one of the messages "–∫—Ä—É–≥—É –Ω–µ—Ç –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–∞" and Google translated it. "The circle has no end."

When I went back to my messages the thread had been deleted.

The day after that, I had a message suggestion to a friend from middle school I hadn't spoken to in years. "Don't take I-95 today"

I didn't send it, because that's insane. I found out yesterday that she died in a car crash that day.

Two days ago, my phone started talking to itself.

I sometimes have sent text messages to myself as the world's most complicated way of taking notes. This was not that.

I can't copy the whole thing to this post, I haven't even read them all, but here is a sample.

"What's up?"
"Not much, you?"

On repeat for 3 hours yesterday morning, followed by:

"Knock, knock"
"Who's there?"
"Banana"
"Banana who?"

For another 2 hours. Followed by:

"Orange"
"Orange who?"
"Orange you glad I didn't say banana"
"No"

"Jimmy, you need to lighten up. You're always so serious."

"I know, Jimmy, you're a good friend."

"You're the good friend, Jimmy."

"We should meet up"

These self-messages we're less creepy than the predictions and Russian texts because they at least just seemed like a bug. They were by far the most annoying though. I would set my phone down for 20 minutes and come back to 1,000 notifications, made worse by the fact that the messages all were doubled up since they were sent and received by my phone number.

This morning, the messages slowed down and changed.

"It's almost over, Jimmy"
"It's almost over, Jimmy"

"I'm coming for you, Jimmy." 
"I'm coming for you, Jimmy."

"Not if I get you first"
"Not if I get you first"

"There's no way out."
"There's no way out."

"Nothing you can do"
"Nothing you can do"

At some point, the text messages started writing this post. 

This whole post. 

Yes, I am literally just copying and pasting this post from my messages one piece at a time. Yes, even this part. Yes, even the next part. Yes, the descriptions of my actions are accurate.

When it was finished, it sent a link to the r/nosleep subreddit, but when I clicked it, I got a 404 not found message. I read through the post it had sent, and realized that this would soon be [the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/webpie/i_signed_up_for_a_beta_test_now_i_have_no_other/) to the story it had written for me.

"For them to remember me" it said.

I'm scared guys. Something is going to happen,  but I don't know if it's going to happen to me or the AI.

I want to throw out my phone, but even as I am copying this post over, I can see more messages coming in:

"Jimmy finished posting and went to the bathroom. He had been holding it in"

There are replies to comments written out already.

I don't think I can stop reading.

About a year ago, I was going for a walk in my local park when I came across an injured crow. The crow had one leg, a broken wing and half his beak was gone. 

“There’s nothing I can do for you, buddy” I said so I continued walking and then went home.

That night, I was in bed and closed my eyes to fall asleep but I could feel a kind of presence in the room. I ignored it because I thought it was just in my head but it didn’t go away. I opened my eyes to make sure there was nothing in the room but when my eyes opened, they were locked with two others. Two big white eyes. I jumped off the bed in fear and turned on the light. Standing at the other side of my bed was an 8ft tall shadowy figure with no facial features except for the two large white eyes that locked with my own. I grabbed the lamp on my bedside locker and held it tight

“Whoe…whatever you are, y-you better get out of my house now”

It just kept staring at me

“I-if you don’t l-leave now I’ll be forced to attack you”

It kept staring

“I-I mean it”

I jumped onto the bed still holding the lamp to make myself look bigger than it but all it did was look up at me. I swung the lamp at it but it just phased right through. I took a few more swings but the lamp just kept phasing through the figure

I ran out of the house and rang my friend and asked him if I could stay at his place. He asked me what was up. I told him I could hear noises outside my house and I was a bit anxious staying there myself. He told me to come on.

When I arrived at his place, he brought me in a blanket and pillow and told me I could sleep on the couch. I’ve slept there many times so I was used to it by then. I closed my eyes to fall asleep but I felt the presence again and when I opened my eyes, the shadowy figure was standing over me looking down at me.

I screamed and my friend ran into the living room.

“What is it?”

“L-look”

He turned on the light

“What?”

“It’s standing r-right there?”

“What  is?”

“You can’t see it”

“See what, Eric”

“The figure”

“Figure. I think you’re just seeing things”

“I-I’m not. It’s looking right at me”

“Is this “figure” the reason you didn’t want to stay at home tonight”

“Y-yes”

“Well, I don’t see anything so you’re just imagining things”

“I’M NOT”

“Calm down. Have you heard of scizofrenia ?”

“Yes, but this is not that”

“It looks like it is”

“I know it’s not”

“Whatever you say. Go to sleep and I’m sure “the figure” will be gone tomorrow”

“O-okay”

I closed my eyes again, trying not to open them. After about 3 hours I finally fell asleep. The next morning, my friend woke me up

“Is it gone”

I opened my eyes and the only eyes I was locked with were my friend’s 

“Yeah”

“You were probably just overtired. Long day yesterday?”

“Yeah, long enough I suppose”

“Well, I’m off today so maybe you can chill out with me here today”

“That’d be great, thanks”

We sat on the couch watching comedy movies all day. My friend offered to let me stay again that night, which I accepted

Like the night before, I closed my eyes to fall asleep but again I felt the presence. I refused to open my eyes but after what felt like a few hours, I was unable to sleep and opened my eyes anyway. There they were, those two big white eyes. Instead of screaming this time, I took out my phone and searched up

“Shadowy figure with large white eyes” to see if Google had an answer for whatever the fuck I was seeing

The first page I visited had my answer. 

“Have you been seeing a shadowy figure with large white eyes standing intimidatingly over you at night? If so, I’m sorry to say you’ve been cursed”
 
“Cursed?” I thought

“If you’re reading this, you’ve likely failed the test. Have you encountered a crow that looked to be at death’s door? Did you refuse to help it? If so, you’ve really pissed off the Umbra.  Not to worry though, the Umbra are harmless and will not touch you but they will stand over you, staring at you, all night, every night for the rest of your life. There’s no escaping it and only you can see it. Be prepared to not sleep comfortably ever again. Oh, and if you do start to get comfortable with your new shadowy friend, it’ll start to get noisy. Very noisy. Noises only you can hear. They’re not pleasant noises either so do yourself a favour, don’t get too comfortable”

I looked up at those two large white eyes, said

“I guess I’m stuck with you then”

And closed my eyes again until I fell asleep

I tried sleeping during the day for a few days as a sort of loophole since the article never mentioned anything about sleeping during the day, but I had the worst nightmares imaginable so I didn’t do that for long.

My wife came home after midnight. She was covered in blood, but it was not hers.

I was sitting alone in the kitchen eating a plate of peanut butter and crackers.

“Long night?” I asked.

“You bet,” she said, her voice tinged with fatigue.

One by one she took off her large rubber boots, then unzipped her body length polypropylene coveralls. I gave her a hand to help her out.

She filled the kitchen sink with hot soapy water then dropped in a clatter of steak knives.

I kiss her on the back of her neck and say, “Go to sleep, sweety.”

“But I have to clean off the. . .” she trailed off.

“It’s okay, I’ll do it,” I said. I could have added, “I’ll clean off the blood,” but I did not. 

I never ask about her late night excursions. I think that is what makes us a great couple.

When she came home last month with a black eye and minor lacerations, I did not ask any questions.

I cleaned out her cut with warm water and gentle soap; then I went to the fridge and grabbed an ice pack for her eye. I made her a nest on the couch and she fell asleep to reruns of *The Addams Family*.

When I came home a week later to find her parading around the living room in a human skin coat and a necklace of ears, I did not ask any questions.

Instead I gave her a peck on the cheek and went to our bedroom to get changed.

When I found the shower drain clogged with viscera a few days later, I will admit that I had lots of questions.

But I did not ask a single one. Instead, I tore off a paper towel, picked up the larger bits of flesh and poured Draino until the water flowed freely.

We have been married for over a decade. Like any couple, we have had our ups and downs.

We have based our relationship on a firm foundation of trust. Part of that trust is being of aware of times when ignorance is better than knowledge.

Unlike other couples who are mired in suspicions, jealousy, and conjecture, we have persevered.

Trust, when reciprocated, feels like a special kind of magic.

Last night, she came home early. I had not cleared off the chalk pentagram from the living room floor, and the sacrifices were still writhing in a puddle of blood on the floor.

I heard the front door click shut and I found her gazing at me.

I was terrified: what would she think of me? Not a soul knows about my pastime.

Instead, she just smiled at me. She asked if I wanted a cup of coffee.

I mumbled “yes please” and she disappeared into the kitchen.

I quickly finished the ritual, mopped up the blood, and placed the bodies in our garage freezer.

I found her sitting at the kitchen table. My coffee was still steaming. I noticed she had made me a plate of peanut butter and crackers.

She did not ask anything about the pentagram or the bodies. I thought she would have commented on the metal skewers or the electric cables.

But she said nothing.

Instead, she asked if I wanted to snuggle up on the couch and watch some more *The* *Addams Family*.

I could not think of a better way to spend an evening.

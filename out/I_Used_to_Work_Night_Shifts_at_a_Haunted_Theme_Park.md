I used to work at a large and successful theme park which proudly attracted significant numbers of people as a consequence of the intense thrill rides and other entertainment venues it contained. It was a summer holiday and I was a student who was keen to find job opportunities in order to make some money during the break. What better place to work, I asked myself, than the prestigious "Lagombo's Land of Thrills, Screams and Laughter"? It was a staggering amusement park with a proud reputation as one of the most popular and well-regarded in the country. The title came from the name of the mascot character themselves, Lagombo. Lagombo was a silver-coloured bunny rabbit dressed in a basic suit whose statue towered over guests as they entered the park. Its legs stood far enough apart for people to walk in-between them, its hands lay upon the title of the park just above the entrance, its long ears leaned forward from the rest of its body and its basic black-and-white eyes watched guests enter with a welcoming smile. Behind it were the vertical loops, corkscrews and cobra-rolls of rollercoasters which decorated the background of the entrance, drawing people in like magnets. As well as rides, there were many restaurants and other venues scattered around the park, and everything in it collectively made it a recipient of relentless waves of guests of all ages and characters.

Additionally, there was also a Lagombo animatronic which stood on a stage at the centre of the park, dressed in the character's usual basic smart suit as though it was hosting all the guests in the park itself. Its main intention was to create a welcoming atmosphere by greeting guests who walked by with gestures and electronically emitted dialogue. Apparently, it had been designed by a team of experienced engineers and was highly technologically advanced. 

I applied and got a job as a night watcher. I would be helping to watch over the park after hours in order to ensure that nobody tried to break in and everything was functioning as it should be. Should there be any issues, I was to report them to the park's higher authorities so that the situation could be rectified. I was not the only person to have the night watch. Multiple individuals were employed due to the size of the park and the necessity which consequently arose for different people to be patrolling different sections of the park at different times. Before each shift we were told which region of the park we would be responsible for patrolling. Our shifts would begin at 12am and finish at 6am. Before a shift I would go to sleep at around 7pm so that I could wake up, get to the park at 12am, complete my six hour shift, return home and sleep till around 9am. This would allow me to still fit in a modestly sufficient amount of sleep for each day ahead, and my spare time could be spent with more freedom given it was my summer break.

When I first began my shifts, there was no problem. There were always other people patrolling other areas of the park and it was not unusual to occasionally encounter them if your patrol routes crossed. This would usually just result in a greeting, a short conversation and then a return to nightly patrol duties. Things began to go wrong after around a week. One night, when my patrol route led me past the animatronic stage at the centre of the park, I noticed that the animatronic was not there. I thought this was strange since the animatronic was meant to be deactivated during the night and therefore should not be able to leave its stage after hours. After frantically looking around me, I then saw the animatronic just barely visible standing a considerable distance behind the stage. With apprehension, I approached it slowly and carefully. After I got a bit closer, its head turned towards me, staring directly at me. We appeared to exchange gazes for around ten seconds before I finally lost my nerves, turned around and began promptly walking away with an accelerated pace. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up straight as I felt the animatronic continuing to watch me while I walked away. 

I reported this event to the management authorities of the park. I initially did not expect them to take me seriously due to the absurdity of what I had witnessed, so I was relieved when I was told that another nighttime staff member had reported a similar occurrence. They said they were trying to work out what was causing the animatronic to move around at night when it was meant to be deactivated. The team of engineers who designed the animatronic had apparently been consulted and questioned, but nobody was able to provide any information as to how these strange happenings were possible. It was not long before every nighttime staff member had reported seeing the animatronic in many different places around the park. They also all reported the animatronic turning its head to stare at them after they got close enough. Close enough was not particularly close either. In fact, you had to be quite a considerable distance from the animatronic before it stopped staring at you. 

Eventually, the animatronic began staring at guests during the day. It would always stare at specific individuals and maintain its focus on them, only stopping after they moved out of its sight. As this happened, the behaviour of the animatronic during the night became even more disturbing. While all of the nighttime staff, including myself, were now well aware from personal experience of the tendency of the animatronic to move around at night, we became additionally disturbed when it appeared to begin following us as we moved around and patrolled the park. At one point I was patrolling through the whole que line for one of the rides. As a consequence of the nature of the ride as a high-intensity rollercoaster and the popularity which this produced, the que line was long and coiled round itself in an attempt to organise as many people in as compact of an area as possible. I heard the clanking of metal against the ground behind me, as I looked behind me and saw the animatronic just a short distance behind me in the que line. I could feel the focus of its eyes on me intensifying as it proceeded to approach. I began to walk away from it and was eventually driven by my apprehension to vault over the lines of gates which outlined the horizontally crossing que rows in an attempt to escape the presence of this daunting mechanical being as quickly as possible. Thankfully, the heaviness of its metal endoskeleton inhibited it from imitating my movements. 

After me, other nighttime staff reported similar occurrences in which the animatronic appeared to directly move towards them. In each case, the staff member in question would lack any curiosity as to what it was capable of should it reach them, so they fled. And then the incident happened. The event which would mark the closure of the park itself. On a day just like any other, the animatronic exploited its physical proximity to an innocent child carelessly passing by its stage. It broke out of its friendly gestures and dialogue and, before any witness could even register the animatronic changing in temperament, it sporadically broke into a state of hostility, violently swiping its arm at the child's head and delivering an intense blow. The child was rushed to hospital while everyone was sent out of the park. Luckily and thankfully, the child survived, taking a considerable length of time to recover consciousness. Upon coming to, the child would experience temporary inhibitions in their ability to process and coordinate responses to their surroundings, but such issues were temporary, and a full recovery would eventually take place after around a month. 

The lack of information that could be provided about any possible faults with the animatronic's design, as well as the lack of explanation that could be given as to how the problem could be rectified, led the police and the managing authorities of the park themselves to agree that it could not continue to operate. As well as this, the legacy which this event had bestowed upon the park resulted in the park itself being closed. The many aspects of the park, including materials and pieces used to construct rides and other means of entertainment, were distributed to investment in new theme park construction projects which had begun to develop not just in other parts of the country, but also in other parts of the world. The animatronic and all of the technology implicated in its functioning, however, was destroyed and burned, and I, alongside all other former staff who worked either day or night shifts at the park, safely stand in agreement with that decision.

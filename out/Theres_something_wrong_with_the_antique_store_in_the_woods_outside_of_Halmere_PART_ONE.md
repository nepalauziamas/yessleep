I want to start this by saying I’m bad at first impressions, and those impressions tend to stick.

All I ask is that you take what I’m about to say with a pinch of salt, because…

I wasn’t surprised when I woke up covered in blood and handcuffed to a stranger’s bed.

Don’t get me wrong. Even in the dim light I could tell the blood was mine – nothing new there – and the way the handcuffs fell apart after a quick test tug confirmed they were not only very cheap, but very plastic.

The bed I was laying on had no mattress, something felt far more than seen. The wooden frame had been stripped bare. Which meant there was nothing to muffle the creak and the groan any change in weight would squeal. But I figured, if no one had heard the cuffs break, no one would hear a couple of quiet creaks.

Experience told me now was better than later, and I’ve been in enough situations like this to know a window would be better than a door. As luck would have it, after a cautious roll off the bed and strategic duck behind the frame I could feel a material – drape-like – against my back. And I knew I was home-free.

However, as my hands left the ground, the carpet lifted with them. As if it had disintegrated. This oily, yet dry, powder grit clung to my palms and coated the underside of my nails.

“Ugh. That’s disgu-”

My hand clamped over my mouth before I could properly think it through, and I felt every muscle in my body clench as the grime carpet rubbed against my lips. On the inside I was screaming.

On the outside, there was no way in hell I’d be opening my mouth. And, as I flailed for something to wipe my hands on in the dark, I remembered the curtain. I pulled at it. It went slack. Sunlight burned my eyes. And a loud, hollow thud echoed. The curtain rod had fallen, and I was fucked.

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

The knock on the door behind me was firm and decisive. It was the kind of knock someone does when they know you’re awake, and it’s time to come down for breakfast. But this asshole wasn’t running a B&B. I didn’t look back. The window was in front of me. I just had to flick the latch and-

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

There wasn’t one. My captor was clever. I’d have to smash the glass, but I needed more time.

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

“Who’s there-”

The bad joke caught in my throat as I turned towards the door.

Now that the window was uncovered, I could see everything the darkness had been hiding. And it was birdcages. The room was full of hundreds of antique birdcages.

Cages stacked on cages, stacked on dressers and tables and closets that were pushed back and behind even higher stacks of cages. This was no bedroom. This was some kind of cluttered storage space for a psycho’s obsession.

It was a message that dripped with intent. Criminal intent.

*KNOCK KNOCK.*

“Charlie?” I tried hesitantly.

The knocking stopped, and my shock gave way to anger. I began to thread the rod from its curtain.

“Charlie Dean. That’s you out there, isn’t it?”

The silence was all the confirmation I needed. Now I was slowly creeping around the bed and closer to the door. Sure, Charlie was a tough guy, but he was also almost three times my age. Again, bad first impression, but I fancied my chances against a seventy-something-year-old man. Though I’d have an easier time of it if he opened the door first.

“I saw what you did to Cassie last night.”

There was no answer, but I don’t shoot single barrel.

“Do you want to know what *I* did?”

I was standing in front of the door now. And there was nothing. No knock. No shout. But no heavy steps retreating. The guy with the shortest fuse in town, and the reason he was banned from every local pub, was ignoring my taunt. Something was wrong here.

“Everything alright, old man?”

The question was rhetorical. You don’t go around pulling people from unmarked delivery vans and cuffing them to bedframes in weird birdcage murder cabins if everything’s alright.

But Charlie Dean’s rage was a tremble and a tremor. It was lots of sweat and lots of spit. It was heavy, wheezing breaths and a face as red as the dirt. And nothing made him angrier than talk of his ex-wife.

On the other side of the door, I felt nothing. As far as I was concerned, if it hadn’t been for the knocking earlier there’d be no one there. That’s how silent and still the other side of that door was.

“Charlie?”

It wasn’t ideal, and I hated it, but I’d have to be the one to open the door. I braced myself and-

The crashing clatter of the birdcages behind me snapped my attention. A dark blur. No time to swing. I bunted. The shiver of the curtain rod pricked my hand with pins and needles; the dark shape slammed back and into another stack of cages.

“Come out!” I yelled at the empty room.

“Save with Geico!” came a squawked reply.

At first, I thought I’d completely lost it. Maybe I was dead. Maybe I was Maybelline. But then a crow skipped up from behind the fallen cages, and stared into my soul with unblinking eyes of black glass.

“Save with Geico!” it repeated.

The feathery little bastard was trying to sell me car insurance which, given the night I’d just had, felt like some kind of sick joke. I’d made up my mind. Screw Charlie Dean. Screw his crow. And screw his window. I was going to smash it and get the hell out of here.

“Save with Geico!”

As if sensing that thought, the bird was now harassing me from the windowsill. I tried to shoo it away, but the thing was either very brave or very stupid. It didn’t flinch. It didn’t shy away. It just stared at me. So I grabbed it.

But the moment I touched its feathers a shudder shook me to the darker corners of my mind. Touching that bird was like touching a cup, or a knife, or a saltshaker. It wasn’t warm. It wasn’t clammy. It wasn’t anything. The crow wasn’t alive. But it moved as if it was.

“Save with Geico!”

Something in the air had changed. Not in a ‘spooky ghosts’ kind of way, but in the way dark streets change when you think of scary movies. The bird hadn’t budged an inch since I’d touched it. A shudder had shaken me out of my skin, but that thing hadn’t even blinked. It was still staring at me; and the more I stared back, the more I realised.

The unblinking eyes of – literal – dark glass. The way its chest didn’t rise and didn’t fall. And that thin parting of feathers that ran from the base of its beak, and down its chest – what I’d first thought was a birthmark not worth mentioning – was, in fact, an ever so fine stitch pulling its pelt together. The thing on the windowsill was taxidermy.

“Save with Geico!”

Each squawk was giving me more and more of a headache.

“Can you maybe just shut up?” I asked it through clenched teeth.

It twisted its face all the way around, in that terrifying way owls do, and I prepared to shit my pants. But then its stare snapped away from me, and out the window behind it. As I followed its gaze I could feel the numbing space behind my eyes, and my throat filled with radiator fluid.

What you have to understand about where I live, is that it’s a rural Australian mining town all the way up north. An endless expanse of red dirt, salt flats and spiny little shrubs boiling away in their own sweat; as far as the horizon stretches.

On the other side of that window was a very dense, and very lush pine forest. Where I’d normally find oppressive sun and illusory water, was dark shade and cold mist.

My vision was starting to tunnel.

“Save with Geico!”

The squawk was no less annoying, but felt far more distant.

The room was cold, but the clunk and whir of an aircon was now noticeably missing. The high chirp of cicadas, the low rumble of ore trains. All the sounds that drown my town were gone. Because this wasn’t my town. This was somewhere far, far, far away. Far from town. Far from the flats. And far from the mine at the centre of it all.

The crow was staring back into my eyes, and I was going to vomit. I could feel it. But I choked it back down. I remembered the crash. But I’d woken up, bloodied, in the middle of a forest. Why was that familiar? Why did I feel like I’d LOST-

A wave of nausea had me choking on yesterday’s buttered toast lunch. LOST. Something about that word was churning my stomach.

“Save with Geico!”

My heartbeat was shaking my skull.

“Please, just,” each word was a choked threat of vomit, “Just shut up.”

The darkness behind my eyelids was going starry. The realisation in the back of my mind was pulsing. There was something wrong with that bird, obviously, but that wasn’t the thing doing this.

It was the implication. A thing that looked alive, but was actually dead. LOST. The sixth season of LOST was playing my stomach like a Rubik’s Cube. The fine stitching of the crow’s pelt was snaking around my lungs and squeezing each breath. Was I…?

My reflection in the window was pale-faced, and wide-eyed. But there were no cuts, no bruises. No gashes or slashes. Nothing felt broken, fractured, pulled or torn. I was standing there, my shirt in shreds and covered in my own blood, but completely unharmed.

My hands shook as I ran them up my spine as far as they’d go. Nothing felt off. I felt around the back of my neck. Nothing. Through my hair. Nothing. I was about to unbuckle my pants but locked eyes with the unblinking feathery bastard on the windowsill, and thought better of it. There were no stitches. And my panicked breathing was beginning to fog the glass. I wasn’t dead… yet.

I raised the curtain rod. The plan hadn’t changed. And now I didn’t really care if the crow got caught in my swing. But again, it didn’t flinch. It didn’t even blink. It spread its wings wide and squawked.

“Save with Geico!”

I’m not even sure how I knew this. But it was daring me to do it. The feathery little bastard was daring me to smash the window. And it was right. I lowered the rod. Whatever was outside this room was far worse than Charlie Dean.

It was the kind of creature that could rob death. In other words, it was the kind of creature you shouldn’t piss off by smashing their window. It was time I met my captor. With a curtain rod in one hand, and a bird cage in the other, I left the room.

Outside was a blur, adrenaline drove me. The candlelight flickered. The floorboards creaked. I snuck down a set of stairs, and was not prepared for what I found.

The place was an absolute dump. I thought the birdcages crammed into the first room were bad, but this was something else entirely. What I was looking at was the entire first floor interior of a house, hollowed out of all its inside walls, and filled floor to ceiling with the kind of junk you’d find on the side of the road. Lamps dotted the mounds like tangles Christmas lights, lighting my way, and I knew something here had gone horribly wrong.

I was looking at a final destination hoarder home. The kind of thing that makes the news after the mounds of garbage collapse and the hoarder’s body is never found. These weren’t just piles of junk. They were burial mounds.

There was a smash and a scream. And then something dark dove for my head. But I was ready for round two. I swung the rod and connected with… something way less solid than the crow from earlier. It was a black, button-up dress shirt, now tangled around my makeshift bat.

“Come out!” I yelled.

“Put on a shirt first!” yelled the voice of a young woman.

Her words were more distant than her scream. She was escaping into the trash heap, but I wasn’t about to let her get away. I ducked behind the display case she’d thrown the shirt from. It was a dead end, the overlap where two mounds had avalanched long ago.

“I don’t have a change of clothes!” I called up and over the mounds.

“I just threw one at you dude!” came a muffled reply.

Her voice wasn’t coming from over the mounds.

I started to untangle the shirt from the rod, “I don’t think you did!”

“How bad did you hit your head?!”

“I didn’t!” I lowered my head towards the ground, “I was wearing a seatbelt!”

And that’s when I saw it.

“Well don’t you sound like a perfectly safe guy to be around!”

Her muffled shouts were coming from the end of a series of tables stretching a tunnel underneath the dead end. The shards of the floral vase she smashed earlier trailed breadcrumbs down the tunnel.

Of course, there was no way in hell I was going through there. It’s not that I’m claustrophobic. And the thought of getting crushed under all that garbage barely gave me pause. No. My reasons were… of little importance to this story.

“Look who’s talking?!” I called down the pest breeding tunnel, “Do you cuff every guy you meet, or just the ones you find in head-on collisions?”

“Dude, you thrash around in your sleep!” her voice wasn’t getting any further, but it wasn’t getting any closer either, “It was the only way to keep you on the bed!”

“Well…Your bird is creepy!”

By this point I’d run out of witty comments, and she was laughing.

“Really? That’s the best you’ve got?”

“I mean, that and this curtain rod.”

She kept laughing, and I realised we’d both stopped yelling. But I could hear her just as well. She was getting closer.

“Ok. But were you really going to hit me with that?”

“Not really,” I shrugged, “The plan was to beat you to death with the birdcage.”

I don’t think she understood I was being serious, because she kept laughing.

“Does that mean you’re ready to call a truce?” she asked.

“That depends, is that your way of saying we *can* call a truce?”

She held her silence long enough to put me on edge.

And when she spoke again, all trace of laughter was gone, “Only if you put that shirt on. You can’t let them see the blood.”

“Them?”

She didn’t answer right away. And that silence gave me a minute of reasons to button that shirt all the way to the collar. When she finally spoke, it wasn’t to answer my question.

“Have I introduced myself to you?”

“No?”

“And you don’t know who I am?”

Her question made me hesitate. Something here wasn’t adding up.

“No-?”

“But you are from Halmere, right?” she interrupted.

Each time I said no it felt like she was getting more and more uncomfortable.

So this time I lied, “Of course.”

And prayed on the flats this wouldn’t come back to bite me in the ass.

“What’s your name?”

Her voice wasn’t coming from the tunnel anymore. She was somehow behind me.

She was young-looking. Her hair was a colour, and that colour was kind of dark. Her eyes were tired, and almost certainly a colour. I’m pretty sure she had skin, and it was smooth like bone china. But as I type this, I’m not entirely sure why I know that. Because the more I try to describe her, the more I realise I don’t have a clue what she actually looks like.

“What’s your name?” she repeated.

Her sudden appearance behind me had caught me off guard, and I’d forgotten to answer her question.

“It’s Chris.”

“Chris,” she nodded.

“How about you?”

She ignored me. And I realised I’d maybe made a mistake here.

“Chris,” she tried my name like a wine tasting, “Chris.”

This time it was me getting more and more uncomfortable.

“Yep. That’s my name, don’t wear it out,” I forced a nervous laugh.

She did not return it.

“Chris,” she gave a resolute nod, and then held out a hand, “My name is Jess, with a double S.”

Part of me wanted to point out that Jess is already spelled with a double S. But I put the weirdness of her introduction aside and shook her hand. Her grip was firm, and then it tightened. She pulled, and then whispered in my ear, so quiet that even distant tree falls would drown her out.

“It’s the customers. Never let them see you bleed.”

A little while later she was handing me my wallet; which she’d completely emptied, by the way. She then told me I’d be starting tomorrow morning. And before my brain could catch up with what she’d just said, she was gone. And I was sliding my phone out of my pocket, connecting to the store wi-fi, and typing this.

There’s a ghost that haunts my room, and he’s the best part of my home. 

I don’t think my Daddy wanted a daughter. Or at least, he didn’t want one after his wife couldn’t be my Mommy. All he ever said about her is that we can’t stop death, and then got really quiet.

He never wanted to talk about her after that.

I always wondered how much control he had over his own life. If you can’t stop death from happening, why would you stop life from happening? Because that’s the choice he made.

He never took me places. Friends weren’t allowed inside our home. To be honest, he never seemed really happy being my Daddy.

There might have been more to that story. But like I said, my room is haunted, which prevents me from seeing all of the things that happen inside my house.

I was very scared the first time that the ghost came for me. I felt like I was falling asleep, but then I was falling. I fell faster and faster, and I wanted to wake up, but something was pulling me far away. I couldn’t breathe, and everything was really dark.

Then it was warm and peaceful. I met the ghost, but I couldn’t see him. It didn’t make any sense, but all of my senses were gone. I knew that he was in front of me, but my body was missing, and there was light. I felt the light instead of seeing it, and that made it real.

“I’ve come to take you away,” he said. The ghost didn’t use words, but I knew what he meant just the same. “Why are you taking me from my bed?” I thought, and he understood. “It’s only for a short time,” he explained. “I will be in your place, in your bed, and your father won’t be able to tell that it’s me instead of you. When it’s over, you can go back home.” “But where will I go until then?” I thought, and the ghost quickly answered back. “You will stay here, where it’s warm and safe. I will fetch you when tonight is over.”

I wanted to ask more, but he was gone. 

I was warm and safe.

And when I returned to my own bed that night, I still felt warm and safe.

It would have made sense to be afraid when I fell through the darkness and into another world. It would have made sense to doubt the ghost who pulled me from my room and took my place at night. Yet I wasn’t afraid. I could feel goodness in the ghost.

But I felt sadness, too. 

It got stronger as time went on. The ghost would be in front of me for just a second when I came into his world. Each time, he got colder. Each time, he spoke less. 

I wanted to make him feel better, but I didn’t know how. I wondered, then, if this was the part of growing up that no one talks about. Maybe everyone can see pain in the people around them, but they just don’t understand what to ask about why it’s there, even where the suffering person only needs to *share* a story that nobody knows how to talk about.

I wanted to tell my Daddy stories about the ghost that came into my room at night. But whenever I tried, he got very red and quiet. Sometimes, he would walk away, and I would hear a breaking sound. Later, I would find fresh fist-sized holes in the walls.

Every so often, the other world would swallow me up while I was talking to Daddy, and the ghost would take me in the middle of the day. It would still be daytime when I returned, but my Daddy always avoided me until the next morning.

I don’t think he wanted to hear my stories. I never understood why; all I wanted was someone to share them with. 

And it’s not even important to believe the story a friend tells you. Most of the time, the friend just wants to know they’re valuable enough to be heard.

Even though I was very young, I still understood that a man should value his daughter.

I didn’t know how to solve the problem, so I learned to stop talking about it. No one wanted to hear what I had to say.

So the problem spoke for itself.

It just got bigger and bigger because no one was listening. And suddenly, everything changed.

I counted nineteen punches in the wall that night, and thirteen seconds later, my door was rattling on its hinges. I didn’t understand *why* I had to be afraid, but I knew *that* I did. Sometimes, there is no “why” when people are scared.

I put my faith in the door’s lock.

My faith was broken.

I was falling. The ghost passed by me on the way down, and I could feel the fear wrapping around him like swirls of pure white cream in black coffee.

I was rising. But I immediately started falling again, and nothing made sense, and everyone was spinning around each other. 

Then I was in the ghost’s home. I was warm. I was safe.

I was pulled out again.

I landed on my bed hard enough to bounce. I gasped for air and sat up. It smelled like pennies. I felt a thick layer of sticky, red liquid pour down my shirt.

My father’s silhouette remained still at the other end of the room. I was confused, because he didn’t look angry. 

“I’m so sorry,” he whispered, strange and familiar all at once. “But I can’t stop death. No one can.”

I was uncomfortable, and I wanted to cry. But the worst kinds of tears are those shared with people who don’t care, so I had learned not to cry around my Daddy.

He took in a deep breath, and I understood that *he* was crying softly in the dark. 

“Who died?” I asked quietly.

He froze for several seconds. “You did.”

I felt the liquid on my chest, then looked down at my fingertips. An angry shade of red was barely visible in the moonlight streaming through the window.

I panicked. “There’s no reason-”

“It doesn’t matter if there’s a reason,” my Daddy continued slowly. “Growing up means letting things go.”

I struggled to breathe. “What has to be let go?”

His voice rattled. “I’m so sorry. I tried to stop it. But your Daddy’s anger was too much this one time, which means it was too much forever.” He extended his trembling fist into the tiny swath of moonlight.

It was covered in red.

I gasped. “Am I going to-”

“I switched you,” he responded simply. “You could only go into the other place when someone was willing to stand in for you. So no, you will not die.”

My head spun. I wanted to throw up.

“You *were* going to the other place,” he continued, “and then death came, and it couldn’t be stopped. So it was time to switch again. I’m sorry you went back and forth so many times. But someone had to be in your place, someone had to be in Daddy’s place, and the most important thing is that death had to take one of us.” He cried loudly now. “I’m so sorry. I don’t know why it was my responsibility to care for you, but that’s just the way things are.”

He wiped his eyes. “I didn’t think he was a good Daddy. It couldn’t be stopped, and you deserved to be saved from death much more than he did.”

I wanted to ask so many questions, but they all got stuck on the way out of my mouth.

“But I couldn’t leave you all alone. Not after spending so much time protecting you by switching our bodies when your Daddy came for you at night.”

He got very quiet.

“You’re the ghost?” I asked in wonder. “And now you’re in my Daddy’s body?”

He nodded in the moonlight.

“And my Daddy is-”

He nodded again. “He made a decision to bring death into the room, so I made the decision that *he* would be the one to face it.”

I began to understand. “But – when can you go back to your home, where it’s warm and safe?”

He gave a very long sigh. “Death closes doors that can’t be opened again.”

I trembled. The shaking wouldn’t stop. “But that’s your home! Won’t your family miss you?”

He sniffed. “Yes.”

We were silent for some time.

“I’m sorry,” he finally said. “I don’t know how to be your dad. There aren’t any instructions. I have to start failing at it, or I won’t learn anything at all.” He finally wept, openly but gently. “I’m sorry that you’re stuck with me. I tried to do my best, but sometimes we can only choose the smallest failure.”

I sprang out of bed and crossed the room before wrapping him in a hug. I could tell right away that it was a different person, even if the body was the same. I felt something that I never had before.

It was warm and safe.

He gasped between muffled sobs. My tiny shoulder was pressed up against his mouth as I hugged him, so he struggled to speak.

“When you and I would switch, I only took your place for a few minutes at a time. Besides that, I’ve never been a – well, a *person* before. I don’t know how.”

“It’s okay,” I responded quickly. “No one does.”

He took three shallow breaths. “When I was in your place… your father broke me a little bit more with each visit. I don’t know if I’ll ever be fixed.”

Guilt overwhelmed me. “Oh.” I breathed deeply. “Well, maybe fixing isn’t something that happens once. Maybe being fixed just means that you always try to get a little better.”

He looked down at me, eyes wide in the weak moonlight. “How can I possibly do that?”

I let go of the hug, took him by the hand, and sat us both down on the edge of my bed. 

“Well,” I began, “what I’ve always wanted was someone to [listen](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).”

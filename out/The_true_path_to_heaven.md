It is the will of the lord that I share my story. Ever since I was a child, I would pray to the lord for mystical knowledge and the lord almighty granted it in a vision: Knowledge of true path to heaven. Following the lord’s command, I grabbed my candles and reenacted what I did in the vision to call the Archangel Michael. The process was quite simple, you light up the candles with the lights off, you meditate, chant his name, and visualize a certain drawing that looks like a teenager’s mindless scribble. As the lord showed me in the vision, the angel came in my third eye as his renaissance depiction: White wings, blue eyes glowing afire, in white clothing and a massive sword & shield. Though, to be honest, the whole event was quite underwhelming. Sure, the energy of the room changed but there wasn’t as many theatrics as you’d expect from one of the highest ranking angels of god descending to earth. He spoke rather cryptically too. This is the transcript I wrote on the day of the event. 

Archangel Michael: The lands are barren and will continue to wither. The end is near, Raphael will blow his trumpet. The sword of god must align his will to that of god. The process began. 
 
I felt a pinch that knocked me out of my meditative state. Since that day, luck has befallen me. People suddenly started to want to socialize with me, I found a new job that paid far more than I had ever dreamed of, and every labor I did yielded exceptionally high fruit. I consistently know what to want and what to say or do to get it. I am constantly being guided by god to my highest interest and every day, I am rewarded more. I pity those who act without the guidance of the lord for every action I do against it yields disaster. When my intuition told me to steal my coworker’s keys and I didn’t, I fell down the stairs and ended up in the hospital. When I was meant to hurt a little kid walking on the sidewalk and I didn’t, I got struck by lightening the next day. The lord always tries to protect me and look out for my interests and I often choose hubris and disobedience. Luckily, this will soon no longer be a problem. The will of the lord is coursing through me more and more every day, and soon, I’ll have the perfect existence. Today’s vision was of me with my eyes spooned out, my spinal cord broken, and my vocal cords torn out but still able to see, walk, and talk through the lord. I know what I have to do and I refuse to walk any path but the lord’s any longer. I invite you all to take the loving hand of Archangel Michael, and follow the method I outlined here. Walk alongside him to perfect existence for the end is near and Raphael will blow his trumpet. The swords of god must align their will to that of god.

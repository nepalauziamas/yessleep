Sorry I didn’t post last night. So much has happened, and I’m still trying to process everything. I guess I’ll start at the beginning.

Thea never returned home on [Saturday night.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/pi5c8x/my_girlfriend_went_hiking_her_texts_dont_sound/)

A lot of you told me to go look for her myself. So that’s what I did—after I called the police, I headed over to the trail alone. (Well, not entirely alone; I brought our little dog, Gisele, thinking she might be able to pick up a scent or something.)

But as soon as I pulled into the parking lot, my heart dropped. There was her car—her beat-up Honda civic—parked crookedly under a streetlamp.

*Thea’s still here.*

But she wouldn’t do that. Not voluntarily. It was already pretty dark out, and we have a lot of coyotes in the area. She wouldn’t be stupid enough to keep hiking past dark.

Would she?

I tried the door to her car—locked. Shined my phone’s flashlight in the windows. She wasn’t in there. Nothing looked out of place, though it was hard to tell with how messy Thea’s car always is.

The dread in the pit of my stomach grew. I grabbed Gisele and headed towards the trail.

As soon as we stepped into the woods, it was even darker. What little light was left in the sky was choked out by the thick foliage. I took a second to glance at the sign, to figure out which way the waterfall was.

Then I continued into the forest.

“Thea?” I called. “Thea!”

No response.

I looked at Gisele. She didn’t seem to be picking up anything. I tried to call Thea again. She didn’t answer. All I had was that last text, staring me in the face:

**Thea: i'm going to be home late. sorry. i love you <3**

As a last-ditch attempt, I sent a text back.

**8:23 PM**

**Me: How late? Where are you? I’ve been calling you.**

I watched as the indicator went from *Sent* to *Delivered.*

And then to *Read.*

My blood ran cold.

My fingers flew over the keys, starting to type. *Where are you? Please call me…* But then I stopped. If it really wasn’t Thea writing those texts—if it was someone who *had* her—maybe that wasn’t the smartest thing. I stood there in the middle of the woods, my heart pounding, as Gisele whimpered at my feet.

And then I typed.

**Me: That’s fine if you want to stay out late, but I’m going to bed. I love you. Goodnight.**

Three little dots appeared in response.

And then it popped up.

**Thea: no you’re not**

I stared at those three words, my head swimming. *Huh? What does that mean?* Gisele pawed the ground a few feet away.

And then another text came in.

**Thea: you’re out here looking for me**

**i hear you calling my name**

**why don’t you come a little closer ;)**

I grabbed Gisele, and broke into a run. Over the thick roots and large stones. The terrain sloped up, then down. Out of breath, I stopped, shining the flashlight in a circle around myself. “Thea!” I screamed, straining my ears for something—anything—that might sound like her. A rustle, a footstep, a sound. *Anything.*

But there was nothing.

I pulled out my phone and sent another text.

**Me: WHERE IS THEA?**

And then, finally—I did hear a sound.

*Pa-pa-ping!*

That strange little tone. The one I’d heard all over the house for the past two years. Whenever Thea got a text or an email.

It was Thea’s phone.

Right out there, somewhere, in the darkness.

I blindly ran towards the sound. But as soon as I stepped off the trail, the terrain changed. A deep slope, a carpet of dry leaves. I hadn’t gone ten steps when I stepped on the uneven surface of a jagged rock. My ankle buckled—I lost my balance—I careened into the darkness.

*Thud.*

Then a rustling sound off to my left.

The snap of a branch.

I pulled myself up as fast as I possibly could. Pain shot up my ankle, but I continued blindly forward, waving my phone every which-way. White light flashed across gnarled trunks, yellowed leaves. Gisele barked at me from the trail.

But I didn’t see anything.

I sent Thea another text.

**Me: TELL ME**

And then I listened.

But there was no *pa-pa-ping!* No footsteps, no rustling. Nothing. Just silence, punctuated by Gisele’s barks.

The police arrived soon after that. I told them everything. I showed them the texts, showed them where I’d heard Thea’s cell phone. They didn’t find her—but they did find something in the parking lot that I’d missed.

A turquoise earring.

I didn’t sleep on Saturday night. I drove around town for hours, looking for anything suspicious, asking late-night partygoers if they’d seen anything. I called the police repeatedly, checking in on their search.

Nothing.

And then, when the sun broke over the treetops, my phone pinged. To my surprise, it was Thea.

**6:42 AM**

**Thea: i'll see you soon :)**

**Thea: \[image loading\]**

A selfie popped up.

But this one wasn't like the others. The photo was dark and grainy. The forest was all grays and shadows, maybe taken just after sunset or just before dawn. And there, leaning against a tree… was Thea. Arms hanging at her sides. Hair wild. Her cap pulled so far down, her eyes were completely hidden in shadow.

Just looking at it made me feel like throwing up.

I sent the photo to the police immediately, but they haven’t been able to do anything with it yet. I thought they had some technology where they can pinpoint the location of a cell phone… but either they haven’t been able to do it, or they don’t want to tell me yet what they’ve found.

But there’s one thing I *haven’t* told the police.

Tonight, I got one final text from her. After nearly 48 hours without Thea, after my fruitless search in the forest, after everything the police have done. This is all I have. One final text.

**12:01 AM**

**Thea: are you going to come find me? ;)**

I think maybe it’s time to return to the woods.

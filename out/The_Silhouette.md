Yesterday started as a normal day. I woke up, eating breakfast, and playing tennis for four hours. After that, I went home and got on my computer. I sat there for a long time, until it turned dark.

I started to get an uneasy feeling. I didn’t know if it was because I was playing a ghost game, but it felt like someone was watching me. I usually check out the window because it is directly in front of me, but nothing is ever out there. I decided to look out the window to calm my nerves and show myself that there was nothing out there. Sadly, this did anything except calm my nerves. I saw a figure in the dark, behind the shed.

Do you know how the human brain has been trained to recognize humanoid shapes? Like if there was a fake human robot in front of me I wouldn’t be able to tell it’s a robot, but I would get this weird feeling that it isn’t real? Its body is too perfect, its nose is perfectly centered, that type of stuff. Well, that’s what I felt when I saw the silhouette. Its body looked too perfect and it stood too still. I stood there and stared at it. I watched it for 30 minutes, and it didn’t move. It sat there with its arms by its sides staring at me with its bright glowing eyes. I did not want to look away, for fear it may move closer, but I have to go to sleep at some point.

I decided to make a run for it, I ran to the room next to me and locked all the doors. I also grabbed a knife from the kitchen to protect myself. I hurriedly looked outside just to see the silhouette is now about 10 feet closer to the window. It is now 2:58 AM, and I am worried about what will happen at 3 AM. I keep glancing at my phone while watching this creepy shadow, waiting for the time to hit 3 AM.

Finally, the clock on my phone shows 3 AM, and for the first few seconds, nothing happened. I waited a few more seconds, and still nothing happened. Then all of a sudden the lights started flickering, the computer started shaking, my TV was turning on and off, but the silhouette stood perfectly still. I never broke eye contact with it. Although, I have to assume that the monster was the one behind all the lights flickering and the computer shaking.

I looked away for one second to see if it did any damage to my room, and it was right there, almost touching the window. It’s now in the light of my room, and I can see what it looks like. Its body almost looked like a zombie, with blood flowing out of its eyes. It had no skin, but something looked like chopped up flesh instead. Its fingers were long and sharp, and it had no hair. Its breath is on the window, and I back up and sit on the couch behind me. I didn’t want to be that close to a demon. Then, it smashed the window and started climbing into it.

I sat there, holding the knife in my right hand. As it got closer and closer, my heart started pounding more and more, and then right as it was about to attack me, I thrust the knife into the demon. Then I took the knife out, and stabbed him in the head, and then the chest again, and only then did he let out a sigh of death. I didn’t know how to tell my parents, but I had to tell them because the demon broke my window and tried to kill me.

I decided to get my mom and dad, and bring them down to my room. I showed them the demon and the broken window. I tried to explain what happened, but they wouldn’t believe me. I’ve been grounded for 2 months and I have to stay in my room. I still don’t know what they have done with the dead body.

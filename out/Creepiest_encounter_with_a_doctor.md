Everything was standard, nothing that wasn’t done before.Until he asked me about whether or not I’m sexually active. I said yes and that I’m using protection. This doctor then proceeds to ask me what I’m doing with my boyfriend like in detail he was asking what we do. I thought okay that’s a bit weird, but whatever. 

He tells me to lay down on the table. He pulls out a piece of that parchment paper stuff that they use to cover the table and lays it on the lower half of my body. He lifts my gown up to my chest leaving me completely exposed. He began telling me that he needs to do a ‘routine check up’ on my breast and that it’s been a standard once you’ve reached the age of 14 (I’m almost 18). I’ve been to the doctors when I was 14, this has never been brought up. I have never had a doctor perform a breast exam nor tell me that it needed to be done. Plus there was no reason to do so

The doctor began telling me I needed to remove my underwear in order for him to do a vaginal exam. I asked what for? He doesn’t tell me what it’s for all he says is and I quote, “I promise I won’t touch you. I just need for you to remove your underwear and open your legs. I will not touch you. My hands are going to be on your thigh, but this HAS to be done.” I looked at him dumbfounded that he was asking this of me. I argued a bit as he kept pressuring me into doing this. Once he figured out I wasn’t going to let him he finally gave up. With an attitude he said fine you’re not comfortable with me. And got very annoyed with me

He had me sit up and stand on the ground to do ‘test’. No idea what he meant by that. Anyways he has me stand facing away from him to check my spine. When doctors do this it’s usually only 10 seconds it’s like a quick check to make sure you don’t have scoliosis or an injury to your back, but this guy had me bent over for 2-3 minutes. His hands were on my waist, his pelvis was right on my butt. I was also wearing a thong which made it even more uncomfortable because this dude was staring at my ass as he held me onto him

The appointment settled down in terms of creepiness until near the end. He was going over my height and weight graphs. It took him 5 minutes just looking at it. I found it strange because there was nothing to really look at. I had been the same height for years and my weight has never changed. He paused looked over at me and asked in the calmest voice “You only like guys right?”

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!?!?!! That is not an appropriate question to be asking your patient. That has nothing to do with my health let alone my height and weight graph. I’m completely outraged that creeps like this are allowed to work with teens/kids. I cant believe this dude hasn’t been fired. I googled the doctor I had to see what kind of reviews he gets. Apparently this is a common issue with him. Parents complain about him being a weird guy and that they would never let their kids around this weirdo. I wish I would have done some research beforehand. I could have prevented myself from being traumatized.

My name is R. I work as an engineer for NASA, with the task of maintaining and calibrating the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST for short). As part of my job, I have to review the images taken by the current telescope I am working on, in this case, the JWST. 

When I started working here, I worked on the Hubble deep space telescope. The intriguing thing with deep space telescopes is that you are basically looking into the past, almost like a time machine; the farther out you view, the farther back in time you see. This is the scary thing, if you see something happen among the stars, it means that you could very well have missed it by anywhere from 100-10,000 years.

Upon reviewing several deep-space scans, we found several planets with signs of life. As a matter of fact, this was a very common occurrence, but it is one that nobody is allowed to share with the public. The strange thing is that we found a twin planet to earth, when I say twin, I mean that it has the same system structure, same-shaped land mass, and about the same ocean: land ratio. However, it is extremely hard to get exact measurements from so far, this was believed to be an exact copy of our planetary system. 

Scientists from all over NASA became interested in this newly dubbed Earth-2, wondering if they have life, and if so, have they developed as we have? However, due to the limitations of Hubble, we were unable to get clear, detailed information about this planet by just looking at it. 

Now, introducing JWST, cutting-edge technology, capable of seeing farther, and clearer than its predecessor. For months, the NASA big-wigs were Infatuated by this big piece of technology, more so by what they could see with it. I and my fellow engineers spent the months prior to its launch doing extensive testing, and calibrating this machine, making sure it was ready for orbit, and my god was it ready when we sent her up. 

After some time, we established a connection, and out came our first images, they were beautiful, they almost looked photoshopped, like something from a sci-fi movie. It only took a couple of days for my team to get the telescope ready to move and focus on the aforementioned Earth-2, and what we saw was beyond horrifying. 

What we saw after JWST was focused on the planet, was an absolute ruin, worse than anything we had ever seen before, there was a large chunk ripped from the side of the planet, almost as if there was a bite taken out of the side that ripped straight to the center. Upon further examination, the planet, or what was left of it, did have signs of intelligent life that appeared to be farther advanced than ours by a couple of decades. There were satellites strewn around the planet and several spacecraft that appeared to have made it a few hundred thousand miles from the surface before a guessed failure caused them to stop. What was truly horrifying was the fact that floating in the empty space between us and Earth-2, is the JWST, focused on what we speculate to be our planet. 

Since we saw this, NASA has programmed Hubble to search for anything that could be a threat to our planet, the paranoia in the halls now is unbelievable. I have been obsessing about this for days now, I will continue to search for more answers, but I fear all that will do is leave me with more questions. I will update again if I get any more information.

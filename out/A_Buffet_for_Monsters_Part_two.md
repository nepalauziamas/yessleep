I walked up a flight of stairs to where the apartment numbers were which was directly above the restaurant. I walked past all of the rooms until I got to the number six. 

I walked in and noticed how clean and small the apartment was. It was a studio sized one with a small couch a pull down bed. It had all the essentials really besides a laundry room, which was down the hall. 

On my desk was a letter along with rules which Stan did tell me to make sure to read.

“To the new employee reading this, welcome aboard! We do hope you remember everything you read and feel free to ask Stan any questions you may have. 

This restaurant has been around since my Grandfather opened it. He was traveling through cities and decided to call this place home. My grandfathers name was Dean Helper. The last name was true to who he was as he was a peaceful man who loved to help others and find solutions.

Speculations of Monsters terrorizing this town became more popular due to eye witnesses and claims of livestock being mutilated. 

My grandfather made a visit to a woman believed to be a witch. They made a deal that he would open a restaurant for the creatures and feed them in exchange for town peace. Greta is still alive and makes occasional visits to the restaurant as well. She created the amulets and how to make them for protection.

What started out as a small restaurant that only had six tables has now grown into a big successful business thanks to word of mouth among monsters, and thanks to Greta as well.

Below are rules that are required to work here.

1. Always wear the amulet. Never take it off

2. Quitting is forbidden. We have information on you and your loved ones.

3. Your loyalty will be tested. Failure to prove will cost you your life or worse

4. Treat Greta with the upmost respect of ever she comes in here. Failure to do such will end badly for you. 

5. Do not insult the monsters. 

6. Do not let monster hunters find this place

We do a good kind of work and this operation is way bigger than you could imagine. We actually don’t kidnap people that don’t deserve it, reading this far meant you passed your first test of many. Some monsters are very kind while some truly are evil. Keep that in mind and I wish you good luck.”

I sat in my chair and felt completely stumped. I felt so fortunate I passed the test but it did require a lot of out who I am. I had so many questions I was hoping I could ask Stan with time. 

I didn’t get too much sleep that night. It felt like a lot of coworkers were normalized with the job just as we would at an office or factory. It’s only a matter of time before I was too.

Working the next day still felt odd, most of the time I was carrying out the trays and not even looking down. I could hear goblins laughing and other conversations. I looked next to me and seen the ogre again from yesterday. I decided I would try to speak to him.

“Hey, uh. Do you need anymore blood pudding?”

“That sounds nice, thank you.”

“No problem, What’s your name?”

“My name is Frank.”

I heard a little girls voice creep up behind him.

“Daddy , could you have them bring out more toe tenders.” There was a little ogre in a pink dress hiding behind his leg.

He looked back up at me with a smile. His ears bent down a bit too.

“What do you think? Could she get some more?”

“Sure! I’ll go tell the kitchen.” She let out a little chuckle and shy smile back to me. She ran back to her table where I seen her mom holding on to another ogre baby.

I went in and told the crew what was needed and then I heard hollering and some punching sounds. Two of the crew was dragging a guy out.

“Damnit man, you failed the test.”

“Please, please.”

Lily followed them looked distraught. 

Stan came out of his office and demanded every employee follow them. 

Another employee grabbed a microphone.

“Attention to our wonderful customers. We have a live body up for grabs and the next person who is on the waitlist is Carl Spangler.” 

“Yes!” A man in a suit and tie stood up and began giving some monsters some high fives. 

That name sounded familiar . I remembered seeing his name on a billboard. He was the towns number one divorce lawyer.

An employee twisted a picture of Stan’s grandfather on a wall began to slide up.

We all gathered in the room and Stand stood before the man who was knocked to his knees.

“You had a chance and failed. You jeopardized the bigger picture and everything good in my grandfathers legacy!” He smacked him with his cane.

“This is our new guy everyone, started like thirty minutes ago, picked him up from a homeless shelter. It’s not even worth telling you his name now.” He reached down and pulled off the man’s amulet .

“Enjoy your meal.” 

The wall dropped behind us as we all stood in that concrete, blood stained room. The man stood up and was whimpering .

Carl walked up and grabbed the man by his shirt. His mouth grew about ten times the average size and leaned over and bit the man’s head and neck off completely. Blood began spewing and the body dropped. He reached down and ripped off one of the man’s legs with one arm.

I began shaking uncontrollably and felt a hand grab mine. It was Lily.

“Don’t scream, don’t scream.”

Carl pulled out a handkerchief and wiped his face. “Let someone else get the rest.”

The wall came back up and he carried out the leg. The guy with the microphone made the announcement and once we walked out a few werewolves and goblins took off running in there. 

I was horrified and tears came down my eyes. Lily was still holding my hand.

“Our shifts over anyway, come with me and let’s go get a drink . I know a good place.” 

I’m gonna update you guys as soon as I can again.

Whenever anyone asks, which is often, I say I am very proud of my twin sister, the renowned physicist. I talk about how excited I was when she announced she had accepted a position overseeing the CERN’s Hadron Collider, how thrilled I am that my twin sister has made such important contributions to science. At the public events, the-meet-and-greets, and the many conversations in grocery stores, I tell heartwarming stories of her studying bugs under a magnifying glass and always cleaning up at the science fair competitions when we were kids.

She came home yesterday, to much acclaim, to give the commencement address to this year’s crop of graduating seniors. She rode into Oscela, this small town nestled against the edge of Florida’s everglades, like a conquering hero in gleaming metal, graciously bestowing small delicacies to the poorly clothed and ecstatic peasants. 

Her prospects after this stint at the Hadron Collider will be bright, speaking engagements, fellowship positions, even commercial endorsements, maybe; her future is wide open and inviting, a clear blue sky over an open plain. When she blows out of town again, off to bright lights and a brighter future, I will stay here, looking after Mama in our small, tidy aluminum trailer.

The instant that Clarissa stepped off the jetport stairs smiling at me while still, rather ostentatiously in my opinion, wearing a white lab coat prominently featuring the CERN emblem, I that something was off. It wouldn’t be apparent to most, but we were twins, and, even if we had drifted apart, I knew her face better than I knew my own. 

A cold chill traced down my spine despite the oppressive humidity and bright sun beating down on the tarmac, and I felt the hairs on my arm stand up straight. It wasn’t her smile. It was too wide, stretched tight across her cheekbones, not guarded and fleeting like the smile I knew. Her eyes flashed in the Florida sun, they looked wild and full of energy, not the cool calculating chips of obsidian I had grown up with. The thought rose up to me, unbidden:

 “That is not my sister.” 

But then she was hugging my mom and shaking hands with the exuberant welcome committee and the moment passed. We had lost touch over the years, our contact sporadic and limited largely to stilted holiday gatherings, she had just changed with age, it was a trick of the heat and the anxiety of seeing my sister after so many years.    

Since Clarissa came home there has been been a welcome bash at our small civic center, a speaking engagement at a mall opening, and many other chances for the residents of this burgh to show their adulation for the local celebrity. And I’m always there, by her side, smiling broadly and nodding along. There’s a lot that doesn’t get said in these quick interactions with beaming strangers and loose acquaintances.

I don’t talk about sloshing through the muck of the everglades, hunting with Mama for frogs, squirrels, and other small creatures so that there would be dinner on the table while Clarissa stayed tucked away out of the sun in the relative cool of our trailer, studying for school. I don’t mention how when we were both in college and the fire department was called for the second time because Mama kept forgetting to turn off the stove, I was the one who returned home to look after her. 

It only made sense; it’d be churlish to feel resentful. Clarissa was studying theoretical physics at MIT, I was majoring in communications at Florida State. It would be both selfish and childish to ask why my twin sister who got a perfect score on the SAT and opened doors for women scientists everywhere is called a hero, but nobody ever says I’m a hero for staying with Mama, for wiping drool from her chin at every meal, for holding her arm as she carefully navigates the weed choked walkways that crisscross the Everglades Park Trailer Resort. 

When you’re listening to bright-eyed school girls look at your sister and explain how they too now want to pursue exciting careers in fields previously the exclusive domain of men, it seems petty to point out that in order for her to succeed I had to watch my dreams, comparatively modest though they are, fade further and further from my reach while I spend my days watching the intelligence and laughter fade from my mother’s eyes a little more everyday. 

Clarissa started the book club with Ms. Crawford and her fellow retirees the second day she was home. I was nonplussed when she breezed past me, copy of Where the Crawdads Sing in hand, telling me that she was heading over to Ms. Crawford’s trailer next door to join her book club discussion. 

Ms. Crawford had been a fixture of Everglades Park as long as I could remember. She surveyed its meager borders with the scorn and sneer of cold command of ancient potentate, and had a clique of octogenarians who lived in fear of the power she held . A phone call from Ms. Crawford could make one an outcast within this insular community of retirees and shut-ins; she wielded the power of gossip and innuendo with a heavy hand. 

She had never really warmed up to Mama, but had never made her the object of her scorn either, perhaps sensing that in Mama there was a spirit less susceptible to the soft power of opprobrium and whispered conversations over jitterbug phones. So I was understandably confused that Clarissa was heading over to Ms. Crawford’s monthly book club, the most coveted social engagement within the cloisters of Everglades Park, like they were old friends. Clarissa just laughed- an unfamiliar deep-throated and confident laugh of a stranger-when I expressed my confusion.

“Clara, I don’t expect you to understand. Let’s just say this is a perfect opportunity for me. You’ll see in time, I think,”

With that, entirely unilluminating, explanation, she vanished into the thick weeds that bordered our trailer, leaving me to watch the heavy green leaves wave desultorily in the humid nighttime breeze.

The next night Clarissa attended a second book club meeting with twice as many residents of Everglades Park in attendance. The night after, she went to a knitting circle held at Ms. Halter’s trailer. Ms. Halter was the de facto ringleader of those few sons and daughters of the heady 60s who washed up at this waystation before death, and she and her bohemian knitting circle represented perhaps Everglades Park’s only available countervailing social clique if one did not satisfy Ms. Crawford’s puritan sense of propriety. 

I noticed that in the following days when my sister walked through the park, everyone turned, in eerie matching choreography, to watch her; a look of powerful devotion in the eyes that followed her, like disciples watching their prophet sally forth to overturn the established order.    

When on the third night, Clarissa announced that she was attending yet another book club at Ms. Crawford’s trailer I decided to get the bottom of this strange behavior. Creeping through the dense undergrowth toward the lighted panes of the trailer, I felt more than a little ridiculous. It was true that since returning home to care for Mama, the bounds of my life outside of Everglades Park had narrowed, that long double shifts at the Quick-Mart down the freeway as well as weekends at the Subway on Halfair Boulevard had eroded my energy and capacity for intellectual or social engagement, but spying on a retirees’ book club? I hadn’t realized I’d sunk that far.

Despite the absurdity of the activity I was engaged in, spying on a senior citizen book club, I felt a creeping, tingling sense of fear tiptoe up my spine  as I drew closer to the silent form of Ms. Crawford’s trailer, its aluminum roof shining brightly against the overhead lights. My shirt stuck to my back, damp from the ever-present humidity as well as my own sudden animal fear. Peering through the dark leaves that scraped against the windows, I saw Clarissa sitting at the center of a packed group in the living room. The overstuffed  furniture had been pushed to the side to make room for the large crowd of senior citizens which surrounded my sister. 

They were definitely not discussing Where The Crawdads Sing. 

The group was humming a low tuneless buzz. Their eyes, all inexplicably the same milky shade of blue, were open wide in rapture, an expression of rapt ecstasy on their faces. Through the window I could see that the exposed skin of arms, legs, and faces of the crowd arranged around my sister was rippling slowly, like small many-limbed creatures were crawling just below the surface. I took an involuntary step back and fell, causing what felt like an impossibly loud snapping and scratching noise amongst the thick bushes. 

All eyes flicked, expressionless, from Clarissa, sitting calm at the center, to me. I turned and ran into the thick soupy night, branches scratching at me like claws and leaving trails of either plant slime or blood to trickle down my face. 

I blundered through the thick undergrowth, every tug from a branch, every pull of leaves at my feet feeling like a cold hand dragging me into the fragrant mud. I emerged from the small corpse of trees between the park and the freeway onto the dark pavement and picked up speed. It had recently rained and the black tar was covered in a sheen of water painted in alternating hues of red, green, and yellow from the lights at intersections. Utilizing the long-dormant muscles from my brief stint on Flordia State’s track team, I splashed through small standing puddles, my breath starting to come in heaving gasps that tore at my lungs. Finally, legs trembling, I collapsed weakly under the shelter of a bus stop station. The fast food wrappers and discarded 24 oz beer cans that littered the surrounding area stood out in stark relief under the bright sodium lights. 

My breath still coming in whooping gasps, I tried to talk myself down. It had been dark, maybe I hadn’t seen what I thought. The denizens of Everglades Park that attended Ms. Crawford’s gatherings were largely a mix of off-brand Baptists and born-again Pentacostals, I’d probably just glimpsed some weird prayer circle, made eerie by my amped up nervousness and the dark night sky. It was nothing, something to laugh about later. 

Only, I couldn’t make myself believe it. The tableau had looked so utterly wrong; so alien. The identical expressions on the faces, the way the entire group had moved together like some united organism. I turned and started the long walk back to the Park. The recognition that without anyone home, Mama might get confused and wander into the dark night alone overcoming my newfound fear of my sister and fellow residents of Everglades Park.

The next morning, in the bright light of the day and without the sudden appearance of any Eldritch monster to wreak havoc among the tidy lawns adorned by kitschy ornaments, with the familiar hum of daytime tv shows rather than malevolent whispers of supernatural entities issuing from within the clustered trailers, I began to feel I may have overreacted. That is, until later that day, when I realized my coworker’s eyes were no longer her own. 

Stacey had started working at the Quick-Mart several months ago after dropping out of Oscela High, an unpromising academic career cut short by an unplanned pregnancy, economic need, and pure boredom. While we did not have much in common given our age difference and total lack of overlapping interests, I liked Stacey. 

She at least could be counted on to show up for her shift and stay coherent for eight hours at a time, something that could not be said for everyone I worked alongside. She kept to herself and displayed a steely sense of self-worth that I thought hinted at the fact she might not always be a product of the exigent circumstances of the birth lottery, and that her stint at the Quik-Mart might be the beginning of her story, not the end.

I felt faint relief when I pushed through the glass door and saw Stacey standing behind the register. At least I wouldn’t have to spend my day enduring leers and fending off awkward, desperate flirtation from the several middle-aged men who were part of the Quick-Mart workforce. However, my relief quickly curdled as I saw that Stacey, who normally observed the world cooly through calm grey eyes in an expression that suggested she’d taken her measure of what this earth had to offer and remained unimpressed, was staring vapidly into the distance, her eyes clouded and milky blue. She turned to me and smiled and the skin on her face rippled and contorted as if alive. 

It wasn’t just her. At least half of the Oscela residents who filtered in and out of the store during that interminable shift acted abnormally. They drifted through the brightly lit aisles grabbing items at random, seeming to be seeing beyond their immediate surroundings, and in silent communication with some unseen but fascinating conversationalist. Ms. Tardiff, who ordinarily picked up her groceries with the deliberate slowness of one whose every moment causes both pain and trepidation, raising items to within an inch of the thick pane of her glasses before placing them gently in the cart that doubled as a walking aide, strode unaided through the store, glasses around the neck and unneeded. It felt like I was living in a overwrought 50s period horror, watching the townsfolk be replaced by some alien entity representing a thinly disguised metaphor for communism. 

I kept turning over the thought of dated scifi horrors on my walk home, the streets eerily deserted. I was remembering an event that happened during Clarissa’s tenure at the Hadron Collider. At one point as the machine ran, there had been a power surge and a brief fail of one of the many generators. The incident was unremarkable but had become something of a flashpoint for a minor conspiracy movement on internet forums. A small, but extremely dedicated, group of people speculating darkly, and enthusiastically confirming each others’ cognitive biases and gaps of logic, had become convinced that the surge represented a deliberate attempt to hide Something that had occurred in the lab.

What exactly that Something was, who planned it, what possible benefit, and to whom, flowed from it, was never clearly explicated. However, in this exciting new age of conspiracy without the theory, such details mattered little. In fact, given the rapid and overwhelming pace of the news cycle, this particular controversy quickly disappeared into the thick churn of internet conspiracy theories that flowed freely and without end this summer. It never received mainstream media attention and quickly ran out of steam like many minor internet delusions. While it lasted, internet sleuths endlessly dissected and discussed the few seconds of footage available online before the surge and loss of signal, many convinced that some object or entity could be seen, via blurry enhanced images, enter the frame through the dark maw of the collider’s entrance . 

I had laughed this off as yet another example of the new threat posed by the alarming number of  fevered individuals with an overwhelming desire to make sense of the world, paired with a complete lack of intellectual humility, finally being given platforms where they could discuss their theories with other like-minded individuals, free from the harsh glare of reason and skepticism. But on my walk home, I felt my cool sense of superiority begin to crack. Perhaps there were still unexplored corners of this world, unturned rocks where things dark and inexplicable festered. Perhaps the scientists running the collider where wielding something they did not understand.

The sun sunk low in the sky as I walked slowly home, the pink sky turning purple and then black over the roofs of the fast-food stores, pawn shops, and gas stations, that littered this stretch of freeway. It was dark by the time I turned onto the cracked driveway that led to Everglades Park. 

The residents were waiting for me. They stood outside their trailers, expressionless and motionless. They lined the main walkway like flocked birds on a telephone wire, watching me with dispassionate interest. As I clutched my purse tight and walked toward my home where Mama waited, they turned in unison to watch my progress. Nobody uttered a word. 

Clarissa was waiting for me on the steps. She smiled broadly; again that smile I did not recognize. Her hair was pulled tight and the white of her forehead shone under the street lights. I could see faint traces of movement pulse under the skin. 

“Come on in, Clara,” she said gently, “we’ve been waiting for you.” 

I walked up the steps and pushed through the screen door, not knowing what else to do. 

Clarissa followed me and I heard a voiceless whispering shuffling noise, and knew, without looking, that those gathered outside were moving in unison to surround the small trailer. I could see them all standing shoulder to shoulder through the living room window, their eyes the same hue of cloudy blue, the only movement a slow and sickening ripple under the skin of those assembled. I realized with a faint sense of detached horror, that the ripples were moving in unison. As if part of some greater beast. 

Mama was sitting in her easy chair. Staring past the quietly droning TV with dull eyes, the same sight that greeted me almost every evening.

I sank weakly down onto the faded seat of the couch, Clarissa sat smoothly on the floor across from me, her head resting on her chin, studying me carefully. 

“Do you see now, Clara?” she asked me, “can you understand what I’m asking you to help me with?” 

I gulped, my mouth felt dry, like I’d been eating sawdust. “I don’t, Clarissa. You did this? What did you do to these people? Why?” 

“I took away their worries,” she said simply, “I made them part of something bigger. Part of something that will heal what hurts them, and keep them from fear or want.”

“They’re like, like zombies or something,” I said weakly, part of me still certain I was locked in a padded room somewhere, being watched over by serious looking people in white coats, scribbling down progress notes on thick pads, “Nobody would want that.”   

“Oh but they did,” said Clarissa with fierce urgency, “We explained what we could give them. The ability to be a part of something much greater than the sum of its parts. It’s what we all want. When they spend enough time with Us they see that.”

Clarissa’s eyes were growing brighter as she spoke, her voice was changing in tone, it dripped with honey and invited confidences. I found I couldn’t look away. Her face was rearranging, her features dripping away as something black and chittering began to be revealed. I couldn’t tear my eyes away from its many milky blue orbs, seen faintly underneath the image of Clarissa’s familiar face. I could feel myself sinking into the pull of those lights, losing myself like falling asleep into a dream. 

“No,” Clarissa said, as if to herself, ”not like this. I want her to choose this with me.” 

She was herself again. Her eyes her own, the smile that I recognized. “Clara, I never forgot about you and Mama. I know you don’t believe it, but I never gave up on making the world a place where she and you could live the life you were meant to. A place where she wouldn’t have her mind eaten away by disease, her body wasted by jobs that didn’t pay. Where people like you wouldn’t have to choose between helping their family and living the life they want. I thought I’d failed; that I couldn’t find a way. And then It came to me.”

“It?” I asked, feeling myself again able to move. Eyeing the door, wondering if I could make it past her and outside before she could hypnotize me again. But how could I leave Mama? How would I make it past the silent crowd pressing against the walls? I stayed put. 

‘Yes, it told me about what it could do. Make us all one entity. Heal the ones who are sick and hurting. Make it so nobody lives in a palace while others die alone. We’d all be one. Humans are selfish, self-involved creatures. This could make us better than we are. Everybody would be taken care of, Clara, there would be no more pain or hurt, or sadness. It’s already happening. The parts of me are spreading out, multiplying bringing more home to us. But I want you to choose. We can make Mama whole again, Clara. She won’t have to feel the fear of forgetting who she is, of forgetting us. She’ll be one with us.”

Clarissa stood up and walked to the door. She turned back to look at me and said “I’ll give you some time to think about it. We have work to do. I’ll be back later.” Then she slipped into the night and left. I could hear the patter of feet following her through the damp grass, moving in near unison. 

I’m sitting in my room now trying to think. There is an empty spot in our knife board, I watched the long blade shine in the light as I slid it up my sleeve. Now I wait.

I’ve seen so much pain and hopelessness. The inequities of old age, of poverty, of a world where the weak get ground under and are left to fend for themselves. I wonder if a world with none of that would be better. If our much vaunted free will is wasted on us. 

I look at Mama sitting hunched over. Every movement slowly becoming an act of pain for her. I know too, that on her better days, she knows what is happening to her. I see the fear and confusion in her eyes and know that she can see that she is losing herself, and is terrified. Would she be happier? Would all of us? I don’t know. What should I do?

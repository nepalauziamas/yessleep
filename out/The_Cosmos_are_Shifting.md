Sitting in my closet trembling like a massage chair as I type this.

Okay, so some background. I have ALWAYS loved the stars, space, ect. I wanted to be a astronomer as a kid and still do. My room is plastered with those cheap plastic glow-in-the-dark stars. I have a pretty good telescope. My favorite constellation was always Capricorn, since that's my Zodiac sign as well. This information will be important later.

My grandmother died a few months ago. Directly before she died, she pressed an amulet into my hands. She couldn't say anything because of the sickness.

Her death tore me up. We were very close. I couldn't find the strength to go to work at the supermarket. I spent the day staring at the amulet. It was oval, lined with silver. Deep blue glass speckled with platinum stars, a few of them connected by a thin silver line to form the Capricorn constellation. It was really beautiful, no matter how simple.

On Saturday night there was supposed to be a blood moon. I mustered up enough courage to walk to the telescope and start a night of stargazing as I clipped the amulet onto my neck. As I swiveled the telescope to the brightest star of Capricorn, Deneb Algedi, I noticed something odd. The hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. I thought nothing of it. I continued to scope out more constellations. Draco, Scorpio, Orion, Gemini... Now something was off. The stars looked like they were moving, swimming in the dark sky. I thought I was just hallucinating, that or the telescope was shifting. I didn't see it until it began happening.

The amulet was glowing white softly. Was it glow-in-the-dark as well? I never noticed. Then I saw it. Thin silver lines connecting the stars... in the sky? What? I looked closer. The lines were moving now, as were the stars. It's hard to explain what happened next... the constellations began to take form? Like, the silver lines connecting Scorpio formed a scorpion. Cancer formed a crab.

AND THEN THEY MOVED TOWARDS ME. 

Before I knew it, a silvery phantom of the different constellations seemed to be leaping down from the sky, taking whole stars with them. As if they're dropping off a ceiling. With a loud *crash,* the face of my telescope cracks into pieces as  a humongous starry bull rams into it. The glass shards spray over the room, as my window cracks as well.

I stumble back, watching with my eyes wide as more of these entities drop from the sky. As I step back, a glass shard stabs through my bare foot. I want to scream, biting my lip as blood gushes out. 

Here's when it got a bit... dangerous. For real. 

Through my shattered window, a gigantic wolf-like starry dog leaps into the room. It's cold, silvery eyes stare into my very soul as it growls, a growl that shakes the earth. I turn tail, throwing the door open as I sprint down the hallway. I can hear the dog (Most likely a manifestation of the Canis Major constellation) pelts after me. I can hear more of these... things, constellations, outside. An arrow flies through a window. I run into the kitchen, throwing open the freezer doors and ripping open a package of beef I was saving for tomorrow. The starry dog paused, eyeing my offering. Without waiting, I chucked the package at it. Sprinting downstairs, avoiding the silver eyes that watched me through the windows, I rushed into the guest bedroom and locked myself in this closet.

Please help!!! Is this because of the Amulet? Should I destroy it??? If any of you know anything, PLEASE TELL ME

 

Hi, it's me again. 

&#x200B;

If you need a memory jog, I'm the guy who had a [little problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/uitxc1/one_of_my_students_was_acting_incredibly_strange/) with one of my Legal Studies students.

So, I'm going to go out on a limb here and assume you all want to know what happened after my discovery about Maisy. Or whatever "Maisy" is now. I've been reading all of your comments and have come up with several theories of my own, but, as I said in my replies, I have no concrete evidence outside of what I dug up myself.

Last week had been a wild, wild ride for me.

Okay, please, don't get mad at me. 

I didn't leave immediately after my discovery. Curiosity is a beast, I suppose. As much as I wanted to drop everything and run away for my own sake, I stayed around a week after the phone call with -what I believe to be- Maisy's *real* dad. Moreover, I still taught Maisy's class.

By the way, I never found out who the impersonator was, the one that I spoke to before, but I know Maisy has something to do with this. She always does. 

During the week, there had been some -let's call them; *interesting-* developments.

I'd tell you to not worry about me, that I moved away to Victoria with my mother, that I'm out of her reach now. And, well, only half of that is true. I really did wish I could tell you I was safe now, but the truth is, I don't think I am. Not anymore.

Now, let's pick things up where we left off.

After the now-infamous phone call, I had the idea to follow Maisy at break time; since I did mention that I never caught her outside of class. I know, from the perspective of an outsider looking in, this sounds like an incredibly creepy thing for me to do, but I think you would agree that we're beyond that point now.

You should understand, though, that I did have to keep this in mind as I executed my plan. If some teacher noticed a big, tall guy following a little girl around, the whole operation would go South, fast. I had to come up with a convincing lie incase someone asked, and I had to make myself look as unassuming and discreet as possible. 

In retrospect, the lie I came up with wasn't all that great. I would say that I was looking for a pen I lost. An expensive one, a birthday gift with my name engraved on it. Something that I couldn't just easily replace, so it sounded more believable. It was a real pen I own, too. So, anyone who knew me personally would believe me, so I hoped. 

I also planned to keep at least 20 steps away from her as I left. I would wait 30 seconds before I went after her, and I would deliberately differentiate my path from her's to throw anyone suspicious off me.

It was a pretty good plan in my mind, and I'm happy to say that it worked. 

The results didn't give me much to go off, though. She simply walked into the toilets and didn't come back out.

She didn't say anything either, just dead silence. I would've stayed longer, but I had another class to prepare for, so I left before the bell went.

I know they say the definition of madness is to do the same thing and expect a different result, but there just had to be something I was missing here.

So, the next day, I followed her again.

This time, my exploit yielded some results. I saw Maisy enter the boy's toilets. Alright, weird. 

A minute or so later, a boy I didn't recognise who looked extremely unnerved walked in. I put my ear to the wall outside and tried to listen.

I heard some rather strange things in that conversation, albeit only in bits and pieces. 

It sounded like Maisy was mad about something, her voice inflected with a threatening venom. It was honestly disturbing to listen in on.

"Have you got it?" I heard her say.

The boy muttered a response I couldn't quite make out.

"Don't play games with me," Maisy said.

After some kind of exchange occurred, Maisy's voice piped up again. "I need these... my friend, he'd like you..."

Then, the boy said something that sounded like "give her back" before Maisy laughed quite loud.

"Oh, dice," she said. "You're funny. I'm not... her back... After I'm done with Maisy...You... Nice fit."

Then the boy raced out of the toilets. He stopped outside, his head snapping around to meet my gaze. I jumped a bit when he noticed me. He looked absolutely terrified. I don't know what my face looked like to him, but we had a silent understanding between us.

Maisy wasn't human.

Maisy was dangerous.

And she was going to do things to the both of us. Things I'm still unsure of, but very bad things nonetheless.

He turned around and kept running. I followed suit, speed-walking towards my next class.

I couldn't teach properly after that exchange I witnessed, and I think some of my students noticed.

I couldn't sleep that night. *What the fuck is going on?* I thought.

Surprisingly, it wasn't a question that had ever crossed my mind throughout all this. I had been so caught up in trying to get answers that I didn't stop to look back upon everything that had happened in the last couple of days, and *really* think about how utterly bizarre all of this is. *God, I couldn't do this anymore.*

Unfortunately, the next day, my Year 11 Legal studies class was scheduled before the second lunch break. The lesson was tense, and I think my students could tell. It was past midday, and they were starting to tire. I couldn't blame them; I was exhausted. Since the phone call, I'd been pretending that Maisy didn't exist. I didn't even look at her, which, looking back, probably wasn't a good idea. She knew I was onto her. Regardless, I continued to ignore her presence.

Despite my exhaustion, I did the best I could. After the bell rang, I began packing my stuff as quick as I could. All of the students were more than happy to leave as soon as they heard it.

Except for, of course, Maisy.

"Thanks for the lesson, sir!" she chirped. She was the last student in the class, I prayed that she didn't stick around to talk to me. I breathed a little easier when I saw her begin to leave. Then, on her way out, she said something that made my blood run cold.

"Oh, and don't think I didn't notice you spying on me, Eddy."

I had to leave. 

I had to leave this school right fucking now.

I couldn't stop the nervous weakness I felt all around my body as I made my way to the break room. 

I had lunch with Anne, as usual. Though, this time, I barely touched my food. She noticed. Actually, she'd noticed for a while now. She's not stupid, she can see how off I'd been for the past few days. I just hoped with every fibre of my being that she wouldn't bring it up. 

"Are you okay?" she asked. "You haven't been yourself lately."

And, there goes all that hope.

I had to lie to her, as much as I didn't like it. She would not believe me if I told her the truth. I knew damn well she would think I was being obsessive and creepy. I had to lie to her.

"I'm just grieving," I said.

"Grieving?" she asked, tilting her head.

"Yeah. There's been a death in the family. I'm going to leave the state to attend the funeral soon."

"Oh, shit. I'm so sorry for your loss," she said.

We sat in silence for a moment, until she said. "You know, you don't have to come to work if you don't feel like you can deal with it right now."

I stared at her.

"You're probably right. I should take a few days off."

We didn't speak for the rest of our break.

I left the break room early, off to prepare for my lesson before the students came. That's when I bumped into the kid from the previous day.

"You know, don't you?" he said.

I didn't respond. He already knew the answer.

"Mr Decker, you have to get out of here. You have to quit your job and leave as soon as possible."

"I know," I replied.

"That isn't Maisy," he said. "Maisy disappeared a long time ago. Her family thinks she's dead, but I *know* she's not. I don't know what that *thing* is, but I think it has the real Maisy captive. It's using her body to target and murder teachers and students it doesn't like. But it loves to toy with its victims before killing them. Once it's done having fun messing with you, you're next."

A shaky sigh escaped my lips. "How do you know all this?" I asked.

"Because," he said. "I was there when it all started. I've known Maisy since grade 4. She was my best friend. That demon promised to give her back in exchange for my own body and live mice, for some reason. It thinks I'm its lackey now, but I'll do what I have to. I don't care if I end up dying, I won't stop until I have her back."

The air grew thick between us. "What is your name?" I asked.

"Darcy. Darcy McConnell. But my friends all call me Dice."

"You're very brave, Dice," I said. "I wish I could help you, but I'm worried she might..."

Dice nodded. 

"Don't worry about me, sir. I'll find a way, I always do."

There was nothing more I thought to say, so I began to wander off. 

Doubts brewed in my mind. The poor kid's going to get himself killed. I couldn't, in good conscience, let him do that. Telling his parents -or anyone, really- was out of the question. That would only endanger them, too. He was in this much deeper than I was. 

I had to help him somehow, but I knew I couldn't linger around in this school any longer. 

I turned around, he was still there. This was, in every aspect, completely against protocol, but at this point, I didn't care.

Biting my lip, I wrote down my number.

"Look, Dice. I'm going out of state for the foreseeable future. I'm not going to be around much longer, and I know you might never use this, but if something happens, call me," I said, handing him the slip of paper I scribbled my number on. He scrutinised it, before gingerly taking it from my grasp.

He looked up at me, a tense look on his face.

"I hope I don't see you," he said.

I hoped I didn't, either.

I prepared to leave as soon as I got home. I notified my boss about the death in the family, saying I'd be spending some time out of state. It was a lie, and I had no idea if I'd even come back. I'd probably get fired if I stayed with my mother.

But I don't care. 

I packed my bags and organised things with my mum. She was elated to have me finally come home, although she was concerned about why I wanted to stay with her. I didn't tell her anything about my situation, but I'd figure that out when I got there.

I booked a ticket to Victoria for tomorrow afternoon, and I spent that day and the next preparing to leave. I felt all the weight lifted off my shoulder as I boarded the plane and waved Brisbane goodbye.

When I got there, I hugged my mum, who hadn't seen me in over two years. I was originally planning to visit during the holidays since the state borders only opened rather recently. But that was before I found out about Maisy.

Now, I needed her more than I ever did in my life. I needed her to make sure I never went back to Brisbane again.

Since then, all has been quiet. Until recently. 

I've been catching up with my mum, although I've still been dancing around the dreaded topic. My mum pressed me for it, a lot. But I just told her that I didn't want to talk about it, and that I would tell her in due time.

This was just so I could buy more time to think of a convincing lie, but now, I think I have no choice but to tell her the truth.

Because, just a few hours ago, I received an email from an address I didn't recognise. My heart beat out of my chest when I read the subject title:

*I hope you're well! Love from Maisy.*

Stupidly, I clicked on the email. Attached was an image, but nothing else. I scrolled down, and the blood drained from my face when I realised what it was.

It was my mum's house.

Sweat dripped from my face as I analysed the photo. The longer I looked at it, the paler I felt myself become.

That's when I saw it, the one thing that sent me over the edge. The one thing that confirmed that this wasn't some Google Streetview screenshot. Moreover, the one thing that confirmed it as being taken recently.

Through the window of my old room, I saw myself.

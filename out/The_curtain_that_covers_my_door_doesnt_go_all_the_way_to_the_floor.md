I have a curtain that covers the doorway to my room, it has a lovely floral pattern on it that I picked specifically because the pastels match the walls inside the room. When I first got the curtain it completely covered the entrance but Octo, my cat, refused to push through it to come into my room. To fix this I cut eight ish inches off the bottom of it and stitched a hem on the bottom to keep it from fraying. 

Now to why I’m posting this, last night at about 1:15 I woke up to a scratching sound coming from the bottom of my bed. In my groggy half awake state it took me a second to realize it was Octo trying to get my attention because his water bowl was empty. I walked to the kitchen to fill it up and Octo led the way as cats tend to do. As I was filling up his bowl at the kitchen sink I took a moment to admire the landscape outside my window, dainty illuminated by a waxing moon. While I was looking out towards the fence line I noticed what looked like a dog trotting along the road that the fence followed. 

Now I live in a fairly rural area so stray dogs are a fairly common occurrence, but something about this felt off and after a few more second of watching it I realized it had antlers. I was watching a deer making it’s way along the road, not a dog. At the same moment I realized this the deer froze and turned to look directly at me as if it could tell I’d noticed it. 

Just then Octo meowed lowly at my feet and I looked down to realize the water in his bowl was overflowing. Once I had put Octo’s water on the counter and he jumped up to get a drink I looked back up at the deer but it had already left my view further down the road. Shaking off the eirie feeling it had given me I walked back to my bedroom with Octo following shortly after to curl up beside me to sleep

I awoke suddenly to more sound and quickly noted that it sounded the same as eairlier when Octo was defacing the bottom of my bed, but the only problem was that he was curled up beside me and the scratching wasn’t coming from inside my room but rather, just outside my window. 

My bedroom shares a wall with my back porch, on which sits a small outdoor rocking chair that I use during the summer months to recline and relax during the evenings. My first instinct was that a raccoon was tearing it apart to use for a nest or something but that though was immediately crushed by the shadow being cast on my blinds. Antlers, I hesitantly pulled up my blinds to find myself staring at a deer, but immediately I noticed a difference between this deer and every single other deer i had ever seen, it’s teeth. 

No deer I had ever seen had sharp jagged and mismatched teeth anywhere close to this, it resembled something more along the lines of the angler Fish from finding Nemo than an actual deer. After about ten seconds of maintained eye contact with this abomination I heard Octo hiss in fear and the deer bolted towards my back fence and cleared it in three swift bounds. An hour and two melatonin gummies later I was finally able to force myself back to sleep.

Now finally to why I felt the need to tell you about the curtain that covers my door. I woke up around fourth minutes ago and after getting halfway dressed I happened to look down the the gap between the curtain and the floor and to my horror I saw two, partially mutilated, but very recognizable, deer hooves. I looked around quickly to try and figure out what to do and noticed that Octo was not anywhere to be seen.

 I then remembered when I first got the curtain for my door he refused to come through it because he couldn’t see the other side and I assumed something similar was happening with the deer. After a few minutes of deliberation I decided that the twelve gauge in my closet loaded with buckshot was my only way out of this. I quickly removed the gun from its case and retrieved the box of shotgun shells from the top shelf of my closet. After a little digging through the box I finally found five buckshot shells an loaded the first four. After chambering a shell I loaded the fifth into the tube and moved to the entrance to my room. 

Putting the stock to my shoulder I fired five shells through the curtain and into the abomination stood on the other side. After the second the beast started making the most horrible sound I’ve ever heard, what can only be described as a thousand metal claws being dragged across a thousand chalkboards all at once. After the fifth shell it finally stopped. Once It had collapsed to the floor and I knew it was dead I cautiously pulled back the curtain to reveal the carnage I had created. Before me lay the remains of a deer that had been shredded by lead and strung like Christmas lights in what was left of the antlers, where the remains of my cat, Octo. 

I heard sirens a few minutes ago, I think a neighbor called about the gunshots. I have no idea how I’m gonna explain what happened to the police but I’m gonna have to. I’m writing this to take my mind off what I just saw and what’s coming soon, that sucked, this probably will too, as long as I don’t have to see another one of those deer I’ll be fine

I just looked out my window to see the police pull into my driveway, why is there condensation on my window? It’s the middle of the summer.

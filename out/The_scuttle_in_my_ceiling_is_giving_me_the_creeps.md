The scuttle in my ceiling is giving the creeps



Strange things had been happening lately and I'm not sure if I should tell anyone about it. I'm afraid I'll make it stronger or more welcome into our home. I am not sure if it's my imagination, but I am convinced there's someone or something in the ceiling above me.

A Month to be precise my brother Alan was walking Into his room his two daughters were in the bathroom nothing out of the ordinary happened no one besides them was at home. When Alan walked out of the room darkness above him caught his eye thinking he might be imagining it because of the weed he has been smoking a few minutes before he looked up and sure enough the hatch that closed the scuttle in the ceiling was moved and turned upside down thinking odly about it he asked the girls if they had moved it which would be totally bizarre cause the girls are both small and we don't have a ladder to get to the ceiling height. My brother then attempted to turn it back around but it was quite heavy but he managed to move it so that it won't be fully opened but there's still spaces so that we can see through it which totally freaks me out.

When he told me about it that night when he fetched me at work I definitely tried my best to avoid it, however my eyes always travels to it even when it was still the right side up and closed Perks of watching to many scary movies  in my life time. So far so good I avoided it not giving what ever it was much though maybe it's was just some really strong rats you never know what they do up there. However last night I felt so uneasy going to the bathroom it felt like something was watching me so I ignored it and carried on what I was doing and went back to sleep. This morning I stood by my bedroom door (the scuttle is in the corridor leading to my room, my brothers and the bathroom.) something caught my attention it was a white figure coming out of it, it all happened so fast  maybe it was just my eyes giving some trouble but as soon as I saw it, it disappeared I mean it could be a rat but I could've swore the hatched moved open. 

Thinking nothing of it I went to the bathroom but before I closed the door I noticed eyes staring out of it again I am not certain of what I saw to be fair my eyes have been giving me trouble lately and my glasses doesnt always help me to see. but I cannot shake of the feeling that I did in fact not imagine it. Could it have been a rat that moved the hatch or scuttle in the ceiling in the first place or was it some thing else all I can say is the scuttle in the ceiling is giving me the creeps.....

For a long time, my partner and I use to live in shared accommodation. We've only just moved out and are incredibly relieved to be free of that nightmare.

Our experience began a few months after we'd moved in. I woke up in the middle of the night to a look of fear in my partner's eyes, a look I'd never seen before. Apparently I'd been talking in my sleep which isn't incredibly uncommon but hadn't happened in a very long time, I'd been talking to a man that was in our room apparently. I'd dismissed this as a dream that I just didn't recall. My partner thought otherwise however and honestly, I wish I believed them straight away.

He would appear to me every night in my dreams. Tall and malnourished. So tall that he had to bend his neck to the side and stoop just to fit in the room. Every single one of his bones were incredibly defined and visible and his arms were unnaturally long. Too long. He had elongated fingers and gnarled feet, whispy strands of hair and dark skin, as if he'd been sat in the sun for centuries. His hands and feet were much darker shades than the rest of his body though, as if he'd been digging through dirt. The scariest feature he had however, were his sickeningly bright yellow pupils. Unnaturally bright, the darkness would be so thick that you could barely discern any of his features, all except those piercing eyes however. 

One night I had gone downstairs to grab some ice cream, came back up to see my partner cowering in the corner at the opposite end of the room. I hurried to their side and was told that they could hear someone running around downstairs and crashing into things. They thought somebody had broken in and assaulted me then proceeded to run up the stairs and stand directly outside our room. I just note that whilst I was downstairs, I had heard absolutely none of this commotion and had no knowledge of the situation my partner thought they could hear. I believe them though. I've never seen them so afraid and they're a terrible liar so I can always tell when they are.

Another night there was a really intense storm. Thunder, lightning, lashing rain, the lot. We were stood under cover having a cigarette before bed when a particularly bright fork of lightning went off above us and for that split second that the sky was illuminated, he was there in front of us. About 20 get away, now stood up straight and still holding us in his gaze with those almost hypnotically bright pupils. Both of us saw him, both of us were frozen in place and helpless. I remember my partner grabbing my arm. I will never forget his face. Expressionless yet full of malice, his presence was overwhelming and we could do nothing but stand and stare as another lightning strike went off and revealed him to be much closer, again he was only visible for that split second but that's all we needed to know that we were no longer safe. Too stubborn to leave, we just ran to our room and tried to sleep. I dream of him every night, I know he plagues the thoughts of my partner too. 

A couple of days ago, whilst showing her around our new house, my niece looked and me and asked "is that room for the tall man? I don't like him very much, he says horrid things about you and [my partner]" before proceeding to not answer any of the questions about him I presented to her. I know he's here now, I just pray he doesn't hurt my partner or niece.

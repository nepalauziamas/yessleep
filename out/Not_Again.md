Alfred opened the front door and walked into his apartment.‭ ‬Sliding the chain on the door and putting his keys on the hook by the door,‭ ‬he took off his coat and hung it up.‭ ‬Next,‭ ‬he took off his shoes and places them beside the door.‭ ‬Alfred stood in the foyer and took a deep breath.‭ ‬Glancing at his watch,‭ ‬it was still early.‭ ‬Walking wearily to the bathroom,‭ ‬he begins taking off his shirt.‭ ‬He closes the door and takes the rest of his clothes off.‭ ‬After turning on the shower,‭ ‬he steps in.‭ ‬He closes his eyes and lets the warm water run over his body.‭ ‬Taking a deep breath he lets it out slowly.‭ ‬Running his fingers through his hair,‭ ‬before letting his arms fall to his side.‭ ‬The water feels good.‭ ‬It makes him feel relaxed and clean.

Coming from the door,‭ "‬How did your date go‭? ‬Did you have fun‭?"

Al‭ ‬kept silent,‭ ‬he just stood there letting the water wash over him.‭ ‬He was not in the mood to talk now.‭ ‬The day had been stressful and answering a bunch of endless questions about his date would only make him feel worse.‭ ‬Feeling the water run down his back,‭ ‬he let out a huge sigh.‭ ‬The tension in his muscles started to ease.

‭"‬I'll be waiting in the living room buddy.‭"

Al did not want to talk about anything,‭ ‬and he knew his roommate Wilford would respect his space.‭ ‬He stepped out of the shower and began drying off.‭ ‬All he wanted to do was go watch some TV and go to bed.‭ ‬He pulled on a pair of pajama pants and a t-shirt and went to the living room.‭ ‬Wilford was taking a nap in the recliner.‭ ‬Al sat down on the couch.‭ ‬Grabbing the remote,‭ ‬he turned on the TV.‭ ‬He flipped through the channels until he found the news.‭ ‬He sat there waiting for the weather when the reporter said something that caught his attention.‭

"It happened again,‭ ‬didn't it‭? ‬How many does this make Alfred‭?" ‬The reporter was looking straight into the camera.‭ "‬Seven‭? ‬Well really eight,‭ ‬but who's counting‭? ‬Tell us,‭ ‬Alfred,‭ ‬what are you going to do now‭? ‬I thought you were going to stop.‭ ‬Let me guess, this one was not your fault‭?"

Alfred threw the remote against the wall,‭ ‬turning the TV off.‭ ‬He sat there with his head in his hands.‭ ‬He could not think,‭ ‬his thoughts were muddy.‭ ‬And his head began to hurt.‭ ‬He felt like he was going to pass out.‭ ‬The stress of the day was building again.‭ ‬Wishing he could find a deep hole to crawl into to escape from the anxiety and stress.‭ ‬Alfred began the breathing exercises that his therapist had recommended.

‭"‬Is there something you would like to talk about‭?" ‬asked Wilfred from the recliner.

Alfred‭ ‬sat quietly staring at the TV.‭ ‬He did not want to talk to anyone.‭ ‬It was like he was stuck in a dream world.‭ ‬All he wanted was to go back to the way things were before.‭ ‬But that was not going to happen.‭ ‬He did not know how to extricate himself from the predicament he found himself in.‭ ‬He felt like he was drowning.‭ ‬Like a nightmare,‭ ‬he wanted to wake up.‭ ‬It felt like he was being suffocated.‭ ‬Standing up,‭ ‬his hands began to shake.

‭"‬It might make you feel better if you talk about it,‭" ‬said Wilfred.

‭"‬I don't want to talk about it,‭" ‬He looked at Wilford.‭ ‬His face was pale,‭ ‬and his eyes were bloodshot from tears.‭ 

"Remember what your therapist said,‭" ‬replied Wilfred.‭ 

"I know,‭ ‬it makes it easier to process my emotions,‭ ‬anxiety,‭ ‬and depression.‭" ‬making air quotes as he walked around the room.‭ "‬I know all the exercises and techniques.‭"

"So,‭ ‬what do you say,‭ ‬Al‭? ‬I'm here for you to talk to if you want.‭ ‬We can work through it however you like.‭"

Al walked back to the couch and sat down.‭ "‬It happened again.‭"

He stared out the window and watched the rain fall.‭ ‬From the look on his face,‭ ‬his mind was deep in thought.‭ ‬His memories were still fresh,‭ ‬and he was still processing them.‭ 

"Oh no.‭ ‬Are you ok‭?"

"Yea,‭" ‬replied Al.‭ "‬I'm fine.‭"

"What happened‭?" ‬Questioned Wilfred.

‭"‬You know I had a date today,‭" ‬he paused.‭ "‬It was nice,‭ ‬but it didn't go well.‭ ‬It was the same girl‭; ‬I had been talking to.‭ ‬We went to lunch and decided to go for a hike.‭ ‬She said she had never seen the waterfalls.‭ ‬Since it was so nice outside,‭ ‬we went‭ ‬for a walk‭ ‬on the trails.‭ ‬Everything was great.‭ ‬We walked through the forest and saw the falls.‭ ‬She said she wanted to look at it from the top.‭ ‬There was a path that went up to the edge of the falls.‭ ‬It wasn't‭ ‬that‭ ‬bad‭ ‬of‭ ‬a climb.‭ ‬Once at the top,‭ ‬the view was great.‭ ‬She seemed to enjoy herself.‭"

"Sounds great.‭ ‬So what's the problem?‭"

"I decided to take a picture of her with the lip of the waterfall in the background.‭ ‬As I moved along the rocks,‭ ‬the surface was extremely slick.‭ ‬I slipped.‭ ‬She tried to catch me,‭ ‬and she also slipped on the flat rock.‭ ‬She tripped and fell off the top of the waterfall.‭ ‬Her body landed on the rocks below.‭ ‬When I got to her,‭ ‬she was already gone.‭"

"How dreadful,‭" ‬replied Wilfred.‭ "‬I am so sorry.‭ ‬Did you call the police‭?"

"No.‭ ‬You know I don't trust them.‭ ‬Regardless of what you did,‭ ‬they will find you guilty.‭ ‬They‭ ‬never care about the circumstances as long as they can get a conviction.‭ ‬I'm not going to let them do that.‭"

"Yea,‭ ‬your right.‭ ‬So what did you do with the body‭?" 

"I was shocked when I found her.‭ ‬She was broken and bloody.‭ ‬A bone was sticking out the back of her neck.‭ ‬I panicked when I realized what happened.‭ ‬Since the water was high from all the rain,‭ ‬I pushed her shattered body into the water.‭ ‬The current instantly took it downstream.‭ ‬How strong the water flowed‭; ‬I doubt if anyone will ever find her.‭"

"It's ok.‭ ‬It was an accident,‭ ‬none of it was your fault.‭ ‬It was a random freak occurrence.‭ ‬You didn't cause her death.‭ ‬Neither did you‭ ‬hurt her or even intended to.‭ ‬It was an accident,‭ ‬and accidents happen.‭" 

"I don't know,‭ "‬Al replied.‭ "‬It doesn't seem fair.‭"

"The world isn't always fair.‭" ‬Wilford adjusted himself in the recliner.‭ "‬You didn't mean for this to happen‭; ‬you were just trying to help.‭ ‬It's over.‭ ‬We have to move on.‭ ‬You can't blame yourself.‭ ‬It was an accident‭; ‬it was nothing you did.‭ ‬This is a learning experience you will remember for the future.‭"

Al looked at Wilford.‭ ‬He was so concerned for him,‭ ‬but he did not realize how upset he was.‭ ‬The emotional part‭ ‬felt like he was losing a part of himself.‭ ‬Everything was so confusing.‭ ‬Are the fabric of reality and the world tearing apart‭? ‬Or was this all just a figment of his imagination‭? ‬What is real and what was not‭? 

"It's ok,‭ ‬Al.‭ ‬I'm here for you.‭ ‬You're not alone.‭"

"I know Wilfred,‭ ‬I'm ok.‭" ‬Al wiped the tears from his eyes.

Al turned back to the window watching the rain fall.‭ ‬His reflection in the glass looked back.‭ ‬Unable to focus on anything except the tears in his eyes and the slight throbbing of his own heart which was breaking.‭ ‬He felt like no one in the world cared about him.‭ 

"I don't know,‭ ‬Alfred.‭ ‬Are you sure you’re ok‭?" ‬Wilfred was hesitant.‭ "‬This does make the eighth time.‭"

"Third.‭" ‬corrected Alfred angerly.‭ "‬My sister doesn't count.‭ ‬As for the other four,‭ ‬I was in a dark place.‭ ‬I did not‭ ‬have full control over myself.‭ ‬But I truly didn't mean to this time.‭"

"You are a wonderful man,‭ ‬Alfred.‭ ‬I just want you to know that.‭ ‬You are my best friend,‭ ‬and I would do anything for you.‭ ‬I wish there were more men like you.‭ ‬It is exceedingly rare to find a man who is a kind and caring individual.‭ ‬You are one of a kind.‭"

"I'm so sorry,‭ ‬Wilfred.‭ ‬I didn't mean to hurt anyone.‭"

"It's ok Al.‭ ‬You didn't do anything wrong.‭ ‬You just made a mistake.‭ ‬It's ok.‭ ‬We'll get through it like before.‭"

Al looked at Wilfred and smiled.‭ "‬I appreciate that.‭ ‬But she is still dead.‭ ‬Nothing we do will change that.‭"

"You can't blame yourself;‭ ‬Al.‭ ‬You didn't hurt her.‭ ‬It was an accident.‭"

"Was it‭?" ‬Challenged Al.‭ "‬When she died I felt that rush again.‭ ‬The exhilaration.‭ ‬I felt so alive.‭ ‬It was like having the power of life and death.‭ ‬The thrill spread all over my body.‭ ‬Maybe I subconsciously made her slide.‭" 

No,‭ ‬Al.‭ ‬You didn't make her fall.‭ ‬It was an accident‭; ‬you didn't do anything wrong.‭" ‬Wilford walked over and sat down beside Alfred.

But you don't know that.‭" ‬Al got up and walked to the window.‭ "‬I have been thinking about the other two that died.‭ ‬Maybe Dee didn't trip on the stairs.‭ ‬Have you ever thought of that‭? ‬What if Rain didn't get tangled in that seaweed‭? ‬Maybe I had something to do with their deaths.‭"

"Listen,‭ ‬Al,‭ ‬this is a dark path you are taking.‭ ‬Nothing good will come of it.‭ ‬You didn't kill those girls.‭"

"I knew something was wrong with me when my sister asked me to help her commit suicide.‭ ‬I did not hesitate when she asked me to cut her wrists.‭ ‬A normal person would have gone for help.‭ ‬Instead,‭ ‬I slit her wrists,‭ ‬and then sat against the bathroom door and watched her die.‭ ‬I felt pleased when I helped to release her from the hurt of being raped.‭"

"Your therapist said what happened was not your fault.‭ ‬You were young and impressionable.‭ ‬You were manipulated by your traumatized sister.‭"

"I know what she said.‭ ‬But the other four weren't,‭" ‬replied Al.

‭"‬You only do that when the voices and hallucinations became too powerful for you.‭ ‬We learned that if we kept the heads preserved in jars,‭ ‬then the need stays away.‭ ‬Life had been stressful lately.‭ ‬You need to take care of yourself.‭ ‬Besides,‭ ‬you only go after prostitutes.‭ ‬You don't kill innocent people.‭" 

"I have to stop this.‭ ‬It is not the right way to live.‭ ‬My therapist doesn't know what is going on.‭ ‬I cannot go back there because I cannot trust her anymore.‭ ‬She is just like the rest of them.‭ ‬I don't want to talk to her or to any of them.‭ ‬I want to be left alone.‭"

"Al,‭ ‬you are getting into the dark place again.‭ ‬We have been through this before.‭ ‬I know what you are feeling.‭ ‬I understand.‭ ‬We need to get you back into the right mindset.‭"

Al sat back down.‭ ‬He was agitated because he could not organize his thoughts.‭ ‬His head was a little too cloudy for him to concentrate,‭ ‬but he tried his best to focus.‭ ‬With emotions running high,‭ ‬he wanted to cry.‭ ‬He did not want to deal with this.‭ ‬His depression was severe.‭ ‬He was mad at himself,‭ ‬the world,‭ ‬and about everything.‭ ‬The anxiety was so overwhelming that he thought it would take over.‭ 

"It's frustrating.‭ ‬I'm really sick of people thinking they can tell me what to do all the time.‭ ‬All the people judging me,‭ ‬I am tired of being labeled.‭ ‬I feel like everyone is watching me,‭ ‬waiting for me to make a mistake.‭ ‬I feel like I have a huge target on my back.‭"

"Al,‭ ‬it's over.‭ ‬We have to move on.‭"

"I'm tired of moving on too.‭ ‬Life is one long series of hurdles that are designed to keep me down.‭ ‬Feeling like this,‭ ‬I am tired of living.‭ ‬I feel exhausted from feeling anything.‭ ‬I wish I could just go dig a hole and crawl into it.‭ ‬Leave all the troubles of the world behind.‭"

"You need to get out of this place if just for a little while.‭ ‬Spending too much time cooped up at home is not good for you,‭" ‬replied Wilfred.‭

"I don't know maybe your right.‭ ‬I have felt so stressed lately.‭"

"How about this‭? ‬The rain has stopped,‭ ‬let's go for a walk.‭" ‬Wilfred suggested excitedly.‭ "‬A walk and fresh air always clear the cobwebs away.‭ ‬Plus it gets you out of here for a while.‭"

"Yea,‭ ‬that actually sounds good.‭" ‬Al got up and walked toward the front door.‭ "‬Come on Wilfred,‭ ‬let's go for a walk.‭"

Wilfred grabbed the leash at the end of the couch.‭ ‬He came prancing toward the front door with his leash in his mouth.‭ ‬His tail wagged happily as Alfred attacked the leash to his collar and opened the door.‭ ‬Al followed Wilfred out the door.

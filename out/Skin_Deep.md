 "I wasn't always this hideous." 

The negative, self-hating words blurted from my cracked, swollen lips as I glared at myself in the mirror.

It wasn't helpful, but it was true. I was pretty once. Clear green eyes, high cheekbones, full lips. I could have grown to be beautiful.

 I took a swig of my merlot and steeled my mini-meltdown. My skin, my "unique look" has earned me thousands. It can be so hard to stay on this positive mindset, focus on the money. 

The money, the followers, the clicks, the comments, the fans. It's all worth it, right? What a life. 

Once I was sufficiently tipsy, I started my nightly ritual. Rude pustules throbbed across my cheeks, inflamed further by the deep and agonising cysts brewing deep under my skin. 

I took my surgical blade and nicked a bulbous  growth just under my cheekbone. I had my iPhone ready to film as I pressed around the swelling. First clear liquid, then an audible "CRACK". Thick yellow fluid, like custard, flowed from the new gash in my face as I pushed out a flowing noodle of thick, hard core. 

I then picked at a few shallow blackheads and filmed them sliding out clean. That's it. That's the money. 

Within 12 hours of my newest video bring posted, I had 1200 new viewers. 15,000 watchers. 
Best of all I had my handful of rich, sick weirdos that were gagging for me to make private videos for them. Some want to see my attack my skin naked, some want to see me do sick shit with the pus cores... You know, cracking them open and putting them in my mouth.. Fuck that, but for a $1500 tip I'm keen as long as alcohol is involved. 

I was only 15 when my skin erupted. My mother spent hundreds, thousands on dermatologist treatments but no matter what we tried, it made my skin worse and affected me in other ways.. Oral pills made me vomit. Topical creams seemed to "feed" the acne. It was on my many Internet searches that I found that people actually like popping videos. Some REALLY like them. 

I had something special. Daily invasions of rock-hard, swollen, oily cysts that eventually cracked open to reveal thick, clean, wormlike pus cores. I had the audience riveted, yet felt like such a pariah in my real life. 

The one on my chin has been bothering me for over a week. I set up to film, gingerly slicing into it... I get only blood and sebum. No core. My whole face throbs and aches afterwards, but it makes me more determined. 

Break time. More wine, a cigarette, a moment of "what the fuck is my life?"

Surely it's time to leave it alone before it gets infected, should I try one more time? I'm conflicted, compulsive, and pissed off. 

Eventually I decide to try one more time for the night. 
I push hard with the scalpel, wiggling the blade ever so slightly. More blood. I push the edges, making sure to pinch upwards. There's resistance, pressure, pain, frustration. 

One big deep breath in... and out. I tense my entire body for one last hard squeeze. 

CRACK. 

Screaming... Where is that screaming coming from? It's me, it's me. Oh god, it's me. Screaming, gagging, hyperventilating, crying as a cluster of writhing maggots free themselves from the nest deep inside my face.

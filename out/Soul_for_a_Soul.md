“Isaac, did you mean it when you said that?” Katie asked. She’d just pushed me on the back to wake me up.

“Fuck,” I muttered under my breath.

I sighed, grabbed my phone off the nightstand, and checked the time before responding. *3:15 AM.* “When I said what, Katie? You know I have to get up soon."

“When we were at The Domain in Austin. Like a year ago? Did you mean it when you said you’d love me forever?”

“Yes, I did. I meant it.”

“What if one of us dies?” She asked, hugging her pillow and looking at me with tear-streaked eyes.

*This is ridiculous,* I thought. *I just wanna fucking sleep.*

“Would you still love me?” She finished.

“I would still love you.”

“Can we pick a place to meet up? You know, like, in case one of us dies, or if there’s a zombie outbreak or alien invasion and we lose each other. Can we, please?”

“Sure. If something happens we can meet up here, but if one of us dies I don’t think we’re gonna be able to meet up anywhere.”

“It has to be somewhere else! What if we can’t get back to the house because of a forest fire or nuclear explosion or terrorists? If I die I promise I’ll try and meet up with you somehow.”

“Fine,” I said. “If something happens we’ll meet at the park. Under the tree where we had our first kiss. If I die I’ll come back as a ghost and drop an acorn on you or something.”

“Okay,” she said. “And if we can’t meet at the park we’ll meet outside the art museum, on the corner next to the bus station. It’s on the other side of town. If we can’t get to the park, maybe we can get there.”

“Deal,” I said, not bothering to hide how annoyed I was. “Can you be quiet now? I have to get up soon and you’re not letting me sleep. Sometimes I feel like you forget that I don’t get to just lay around all day.”

“Sorry,” she said, then turned to face away from me. She quietly began to cry, but I was just happy that she was finally leaving me alone.

She was still asleep when I left for work a few hours later. Around ten she texted me good morning, and at noon she called me to ask if I needed anything from the store. I didn’t. I told her that my boss needed me (a lie) and that I had to go. I loved her more than anything, but after being woken up in the middle of the night for the third time that week, I was getting tired of hearing her voice.

I hung up and got lost in my work for a while until I heard my office door swing open. I turned to see my boss, Richard, walking into the room.

“The printer is out of ink,” he said pointedly.

I waited for him to elaborate, but he just stared at me. I already knew where this was going, but I couldn’t bring myself to play diligent employee. “That… sucks,” I said.

“I expect that it won’t be out of ink by the time I leave the office tonight. And for your sake I hope that this won’t happen again,” he left without waiting for a reply.

Richard was the biggest asshole of a boss I’d ever had. I’d been working overtime with no extra pay every single week since I started, and I was the fastest and most efficient worker in the company. None of that was ever good enough for him. He was always looking for an excuse to get onto me for one thing or another, and half the time it was something I had no control over or responsibility for. The worst part about him, though, was that I couldn’t take his job until he retired, which most likely wouldn’t be anytime soon. He’d just turned 60, but was in perfect health and had mentioned to me on multiple occasions that he planned to continue working until the day he died. Maybe I would’ve fought back a little harder if I didn’t need the job so bad. I couldn’t risk getting fired ever since Katie lost her job.

A quiet knock on my door brought me back from my thoughts.

I assumed it was a co-worker, “Come in!” I yelled.

Instead, in walked in a police officer. Buff and tall, the type that should have been striding with confidence. But he didn’t seem confident that day. He softly closed the door behind him, walked into the middle of the room with his head down, and took a deep breath. Only then did he look me in the eyes. Before he even opened his mouth I knew exactly what kind of news he was there to deliver.

“I’m sorry to inform you,” he said as tears started to form in my eyes. “That there has been a terrible car accident. Katie Miller was pronounced dead at 12:45 today. I’m sorry.”

My body went numb as a fast-paced beating built up to my throat. I tried to catch my breath as my own heart threatened to choke me.

“That can’t be true,” I said, pleading. All my frustrations with her finally washed away. At that moment I would’ve given anything to go back to the sleepless nights of her anxiety and panic attacks. Anything just to hear her voice. How could she be gone when the story of our lives was so far from complete? Surely there was some mistake.

“I don’t believe it,” I said between gasps of air. “It’s not true.”

“It is,” the cop said, hanging his head. “A drunk driver was going the wrong way and hit her head on. She probably didn’t feel anything. I’m sorry.”

I knew with a deep certainty that he was wrong. *A Drunk driver at 12:45 on a Thursday? No way.*

I walked past him and outside, then into my car. I sped all the way and was calling Katie’s name as I entered the house. Of course, there was no response.

I spent the next hours crying, screaming, and calling and texting her over and over.

This just couldn’t be real. Who would be the mother to my children if not her? Who would I finally move out of the country with? Who would I lay in bed with and vent to after a long day of work? Why wasn’t she there to hold me and tell me that everything would be okay?

*Why did this have to happen to me?* I asked myself.

Eventually, I fell asleep on our bedroom floor, and it wasn’t until I woke up a few minutes past midnight that I remembered our conversation from the night before.

“*If something happens we’ll meet at the park. Under the tree where we had our first kiss.”* I’d said that, and whether she could meet me there or not, I had to at least try.

I ran out to my car and fifteen minutes later I was pulling into the parking lot.

I stepped out of my vehicle and closed the door as gently as possible behind me. It was completely dark out, not a soul in sight. Directly in front of me was a large field of grass.

About twenty yards out was a small playground, just large enough for two swings and a slide. Katie and I used to go there all the time, back when we were younger, before we lived together, before there were bills to pay.

During the day it was a romantic spot to kiss, plan our future, talk about life and the philosophies we shared, deep conversations we couldn’t have with anyone else. During the night it looked more like something out of a horror movie: the slide was silver, rusty, a little too tall, and the swings were gently moving back and forth, though I couldn’t feel any wind.

About ten feet behind the playground, of course, was the tree that I’d gently pushed her against before I kissed her for the very first time.

I walked past the playground and to the tree. Out in the middle of the open field, I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was on display, like an animal in a zoo. Again, I scanned the area. *Nothing.* I touched the tree with one hand and still, the world was completely silent. No grasshoppers, no birds, no leaves blowing in the wind.

*This is stupid,* I told myself. *She’s not gonna be here.* But I had to try. I looked left and right, up and down, *nothing.*

I sat down with my back against the tree. “Katie, I love you,” I said.  “Please come back to me. Come back to me!”

There were several minutes of silence as I waited for something, anything, to happen, but when nothing did I started to get angry. “Katie, where the fuck are you?” I screamed. You were supposed to fucking be here! I need you!” I threw my hands into the ground and came up with two fists full of grass. I tossed them away and started punching at the ground, sobbing.

“Coming here was stupid,” I whispered to myself as I buried my head into the ground. “She’s gone.”

I took a deep breath to scream, but then, like a voice in the wind traveling past my ear, I heard my name. “*Isaac.*” It was her voice, as unmistakable as if I’d been looking her in the eyes.

I felt the wind and the sound moving past me. I turned to follow it, hunt it down and bring it back with me. Instead, I turned and was instantly face to chest with a man.

He was old, probably in his seventies, but towered over me at least seven feet tall and stood with perfect posture. He wore a full black suit topped with a black fedora, and his sinister smile was wide but lopsided, his lips only extending to his right nostril on one side, but stretching almost to his left ear on the other. An ear that was black and bloody, and that twitched in tandem with his mouth. His sharp teeth crunched together as he spoke.

“She tried everything to get back here, you know.” His voice was soft, but forceful and confident, a powerful energy surrounded him. He could squash me like a bug if he had the slightest desire.

“Wh- what?” I stammered, stepping backward away from him. “Who are you?”

He reached out and touched my shoulder. Suddenly I was frozen, not with fear, but actually frozen in place, like I had sleep paralysis. All I could do was stare into his black, lifeless eyes as he continued to speak.

“I’m the only one who can give you what you want. The only one who can bring her back to you.” For just a second he disappeared, replaced by Katie, standing in front of me, eyes shining and smiling that beautiful toothy grin. “That’s what you want, right?” He asked. Illusion shattered, Katie nothing but a memory.

“Are… are you the devil?”

He laughed harshly. “As close to it as there is. You can call me Lucifer, just for fun.”

“Can you bring her back? Please?”

“Why do you want her back?”

“Because I miss her,” I said. “Because I need her!”

“Interesting,” he said with a chuckle. “You miss her and you need her, okay. What a Christian thing to say. A man wants his woman back because he needs her. Well, listen, I can bring her back, but only if you’re willing to make a trade”

“What do you want?”

“It’s very simple,” he said. “Trade with me one life for another. One soul for a soul. Kill someone, anyone you want, and I’ll give her back to you.”

“I don’t know if I can.”

“Word of advice, make it someone you hate. Someone you believe deserves to die. That usually makes it easier. Do that and I’ll give you a chance to talk with her for a while. At the end of the conversation I can bring her back. If you so choose.”

“What do you mean IF I choose? Of course I’ll bring her back.”

“Just a formality,” he said. “You have 24 hours.”

“Wait,” I said. “What about the police? What if I get caught?”

“Don’t worry about that. You’ll be safe during this whole process. Your only worry should be if you’re willing to kill for what you want.”

“I’d kill for her,” I said, steeling myself. “In a heartbeat.”

“Sure,” he laughed. “For her.”

And then he was gone. The spell was broken and I was once again able to move around freely. Able to do whatever I wanted. Kill if I wanted. Was he actually gonna make me do it?

I walked away from the tree and to the playground, then sat on the swing closest to the slide, always leaving the other open for Katie. *Could I kill for her?* I asked myself. My entire philosophy about life told me that, if she was dead, then it was meant to be that way. But I had just been given a chance to change things. A chance to play God if only in a very limited sense. Surely that wouldn’t happen either if it wasn’t meant to be. I thought about my future. Every single bullet point had her included: I’d be a famous writer with a smart, beautiful, psychologist wife. Our kids would be raised by two geniuses, and they’d go on to make me proud. Sure, Katie hadn’t been doing so great recently, but once we got her mental health sorted she could certainly make a good wife and an even better mother.

*I can’t let all those possibilities die with her,* I told myself. And the words of Lucifer echoed in my head. *“Make it someone you hate. Someone you believe deserves to die.”*

I knew exactly who that was, and less than an hour after that strange, terrifying conversation, I was parking my car in front of his house.

To say that I hated my boss was an understatement. That selfish fuck had been making my life hell for years. I can’t say that the thought of sending him there wasn’t at least somewhat appealing to me. As far as I was concerned, he’d already lived a long fulfilling life. It was time for him to pass the torch and move on. Besides, I happened to know that his wife was out of town for the week. He’d be completely alone.

I almost didn’t feel bad as I walked around his driveway and to the backyard. I told myself that it was the right thing to do. Trading a 60-year-old man’s life for a woman of 26? Who wouldn’t? It would be wrong not to make the trade.

I reached the back door and found it was unlocked. The thought crossed my mind that Lucifer was looking out for me, and somehow I started to get incredibly happy, almost giddy. After this was done, not only would I get Katie back, but I’d also finally become the Editor-In-Chief of the paper, a job that I’d deserved for years. Maybe Katie’s “death” was a good thing.

I closed the door behind me, walked through the kitchen, and into the living room. Against the wall, right outside of the hallway that I guessed led to Richard’s bedroom, was a bookshelf fully loaded with pictures of who I recognized as his grand-children. They were young, hyper, and always smiling. In many of the pictures, they could be seen playing with Richard or sitting on his lap. A voice in my head told me to turn around, to leave him alone and go back to my life, to try and make things work without Katie, but I fought against it. I was there to get her back, and I didn’t care what it took.

I walked down the hallway until I was outside the open door of the master bedroom. Richard laid alone in his bed, the ceiling fan directly above him running at full speed, the blanket pulled down to his legs. He was curled up on his side and snoring loudly.

I walked over and pulled the knife out of my pocket. *You shouldn’t do this*, the voice said as I stood over him. But again, I didn’t listen. Killing someone wasn’t so hard when you knew you couldn’t get in trouble, and when you knew you were doing it for the right reasons.

I held the knife with two hands over his head and thrust it as hard I could into his forehead. There was no struggle, no scream, and barely any blood. Just one last twitch, the flickering of his eyes, and then, nothing.

I looked up to see Lucifer standing on the other side of the bed.

“Wow,” he said. “That was easy. Now go talk to that girl. Then you can choose.”

As he finished speaking, the room melted away to a world of infinite, absolute darkness. I turned every which way, looking for some sort of light, a sense of direction, but I could only see myself. The world was a big black globe, like I was standing on air.

I stood still for a while, not sure what to do until I heard Lucifer’s voice, booming as if from a hundred overhead speakers. “Walk,” he said. And I did.

It only took a minute or so before I reached Katie. She was sitting with her arms wrapped around her legs, waiting.

“Katie!” I screamed as I ran towards her. “Katie, I'm here! I’m bringing you back! I’m here to save you!” I held my arms out wide, ready for her to jump into them.

“Why did you make me go here?” She asked as I reached her. She was angry but calm, like I simply wasn’t worth the energy it took to yell.

“What do you mean, baby?” I asked. “I didn’t take you here, I came here to get you back. Things were so hard, I went through so much for you, I–”

“Is that really how you think it was?” She asked. “Things were so hard for *you*? You went through so much for *me*?”

“Yeah,” I said. “I was a wreck when you died. I went to the spot where we were supposed to meet and this guy gave me a–”

“I know everything, Isaac. Do you know how much of a selfish asshole you were when I was alive? Everything was always about you. I made you dinner, cleaned your clothes, kept the apartment clean, I took care of you like you were a fucking child, and yet the second I needed something it was too much to handle. I needed help, and you made me feel worthless and used. You manipulated me. You made me think that I was hurting *you*. I didn’t even realize you were the reason I felt like shit until I was gone.”

“You’re really gonna argue with me right now?” I shouted, balling my hands into fists. "After everything I’ve done for you?”

“Everything you’ve done for ME, Isaac? Are you ever gonna get it? Everything you did was for you. You could never sympathize with me, you never had the time or energy to be there for me, and for what? All so you could have a few extra minutes to play video games or watch movies or read a book? Even when I died, you cried for you, not for me. Even when all my dreams were crushed, thrown away like they never existed, you cried for everything YOU lost. Did you ever once think about me? About how shitty dying was for ME? About how much I lost? And did you ever once think that I might not WANT to come back? That maybe I’m happier here? Even when I’m dead I don’t matter to you.”

“You’re happier here?” I asked, motioning all around me. “In this pit of darkness? Bored, alone, and scared?”

“It’s not like this, Isaac.” She paused, hesitated, then, “Can I show you something?”

She reached her hand out to me, and the second we touched I felt a burning sensation begin to run through my entire body, starting at my head. It was like hot water running through my veins, cleansing every ounce of my being, healing every pain I didn’t know I had. As it reached my thighs and worked its way down my calves and to my feet, the dark landscape started to transition into something light and beautiful. We were standing on a white cloud in the middle of a blue sky.

“Do you feel that?” She asked.

I did. Joy, fulfillment, and the uttermost peace. I didn’t have the need or desire to do *anything*. I didn’t need food or water, I didn’t feel the need to express myself or look for a purpose. I was simply happy to exist. In the few moments I spent there, I was happier than I’ve ever been or ever will be.

But then we were back in the darkness.

“Do you understand now?” Katie asked.

“I do,” I said, crying and falling to my knees, mourning what I’d just lost. “Please, can I stay there?”

“No. Not now, maybe not ever. You don’t get to choose. But I get to stay there, and I will.”

“Or I can bring you back with me. It’s my choice, right?”

“It is,” she said. “But don’t you think it’s about time you stop being so selfish? Can’t you worry about someone besides yourself for once?”

“Can’t you come back with me now, and then come here later?”

“I can’t go back to something that doesn’t make me happy. Not again, I was stuck with you for way too long and I’m finally free.”

“But don’t I make you happy?” I was pleading, begging for some sort of reassurance, begging for her to make me feel better.

“You did, Isaac. Back when we were younger. But in the past 6 months? No. You were ruining my life. You destroyed my self-worth, killed my perception of love, and were slowly draining my will to live. If I hadn’t died in that accident, I would have killed myself two months and a week later. Overdose after you got mad at me and left the house while I was having a panic attack. I’ve seen it, Isaac. I’ve seen a lot. Things were never going to get better.”

“I wouldn’t do that,” I said, holding back tears.

“But you were going to,” she said. “And you have, multiple times.”

She was, of course, right.

“But I can change,” I argued. “I promise I can change.”

“You never do. Can I show you something else?”

I nodded and she took my hand. And then I was watching as Richard’s wife came back home in the morning and found her husband dead in their room. She was screaming and crying, retching sobs as she held her husband’s head in her hands screaming to the sky, “WHY?! WHY?! WHY?!”

And then all at once, I saw her future, a depression that consumed every ounce of her being. She would become an alcoholic, lose her job, and eventually die in a car accident she caused while driving drunk. She could have dealt with a natural death, but not this.

“You can’t keep thinking that everyone is just a pawn in your game, Isaac. We aren’t just toys, we are fully fleshed out people with dreams and wants and needs, just like you. And guess what? I’m happy now. Happier than you could ever make me. And I don’t owe you any words to make you feel better.”

“I’m sorry,” I said, and for once, after all the fake apologies, I meant it.

“Prove it. Go on and do better. I owe you nothing else.” She kissed me on the forehead, and then she was gone, and the world slowly turned back into the bedroom, one flash of light at a time.

I stood over Lucifer, who was sitting on the bed next to Richard’s body.

“Have you made your choice?” He asked.

“I don’t want to bring her back,” I said. “She’s happier without me.”

“Very true,” he nodded down at Richard’s body. “All that for nothing. At least you’re sure to get the promotion, right?”

I thought about Richard’s wife, the depression I knew I’d be sending her into, the way I’d be affecting not only her life, but the lives of her kids and her grandkids. I thought about what I did to Katie, about what I was going to do had she not died in that accident. I felt like I was gonna throw up. I had to do something. How could I have been so selfish?

“Is there any way we can bring him back to life?” I asked. “I’ll do anything, I swear. I’m so sorry.”

“Sure,” he said. “I can bring him back. But only if you’re willing to make a trade.”

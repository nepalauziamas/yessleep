I’m a full-time day janitor at a hospital, and have been for about a month now. I’m currently at work, but as a patient. I woke up a little bit ago with a headache I feel is more due to whatever drugs they may have given me than the overwhelming scent of cleaning supplies, and I have no memory of having lost consciousness. According to the date on my phone, however… I would have lost consciousness almost a week ago…

There’s no call buttons for me to press in the room. I haven’t heard a single voice or noise from behind the door. I’ve tried shouting for a nurse, but still nothing from behind the door.

When I tried to get out of the bed earlier, I collapsed. I had no feeling whatsoever from my kneecaps down. I still don’t. I have my legs, but the events of the past few weeks make me think that I may be finding myself sitting in a wheelchair soon.

My cellphone(which I am using to type this), wallet and keys - all the stuff I standardly keep in my pocket - were placed on a bedside table within arms reach. But all of these are all useless to me presently… Even my phone, because this hospital is a true dead zone for cell service. I’ve tried sending texts to what few family I keep in touch with, but the messages are immediately flagged with a notification that says they’re unable to deliver. So here I am, going this route…

I’m terrified. I have no idea what to do. I can’t promise if there will even be a part two to this. But in the meantime, I can still cross my fingers - and hope that my phone finds enough service to upload this damn post.

First, let me explain a bit about this hospital: it’s not part of a big corporation, rather it’s independently owned. It’s in a rural area; it’s often understaffed; its employees are overworked; COVID doesn’t help any of this; it’s a hopeless place, and feels so in a rather tragic way. Some staff are more prone to bad attitudes than others - but it’s these people that really push me to be as optimistic and positive as I can be, especially when around them. I have no idea what they have to deal with before they come to work. And finally, something very important: *every single person that works here openly expresses how they love being at work.*

Week 1.

While doing a trash pickup in rehab, I passed by a patient walking with their nurse. More like trudging; the patient was thin, but appeared to be moving as though he weighed a ton. This patient was a male(as far as I know) and had spiked hair with frosted tips, as well as a single stud piercing on one ear. Given my location, I don’t see many guys - let alone any persons - who style themselves like this. So the thing to take away from all this is: he has a distinguishable, very identifiable look.

That same week, I would frequently pass by a room in med surg with this big, grumpy looking woman in the doorway. She was in a wheelchair, and she had one leg. She never seemed to wear her mask, so believe me, this woman's face looked *grumpy.* One can imagine why. Then come the end of the week, I remember passing by and seeing her - but now she had no legs. Just two artificial ones. I’d instantly assumed she’d lost them to diabetes, but in light of my most recent observations… I’d say that I really couldn’t tell you why she has no legs.

Week 2.

Cut to later in the work week, Wed or Thurs. I’m making my rounds and I pass by frosted tips guy. He’s in full scrubs with an ID badge that says ‘DO - SURG.’ Upon registering that this guy, unmistakably, was the heavily sedated patient I saw in rehab just last week… well, I started thinking crazy thoughts. So I didn’t dwell on it too much then: he most likely has who-knows-what going on. 

I should also note I didn’t interact with him, we just passed by one another. I don’t know if I would have even said ‘hello’ anyway because he still looked pretty spaced out…

The next day, I was asked to run some trash bags and glove boxes to the ICU. When I badge in, the door opens to a sight I’ll never forget. First thing my eyes landed on was two artificial legs. I look up and see it is indeed grumpy woman, and she is wearing something close to a hazmat suit. I don’t know the specific names of her getup(because I don’t have to wear them myself) but she had a respirator/gas mask looking piece on and an embroiled blue surgical robe with a hood covering the rest of her body. Except for her hands, of course. I had her gloves.

“NO!” she barked as I got closer. This was the first time I’d ever heard her speak. Her voice sounded something like Darth Vader with the headpiece on; I’m pretty sure there’s a little speaker/mic in it. I could tell for sure that she was same woman because of her eyes, which were on me like the ones you’d see in a gothic-era painting. “THOSE ARE THE WRONG GLOVES, AND THOSE ARE THE WRONG TRASH BAGS! I TOLD YOU, NOTHING POWDERED AND NOTHING SCENTED! MY PATIENT IS ALLERGIC!”

Grumpy indeed, but obviously she has her reasons. This was the first time I’d ever heard her speak. I kept my cool(because I *was* just the messenger; she/or whomever would have spoken to my boss on the phone), apologized, and then promised to return ASAP with what she needed. She cursed, and then, literally, she growled. After an awkward moment of waiting for her to say something(like actual words), she turned her back to me - and I got the hint. 

When I returned with her stuff not more than two minutes later, she gave me the most unthankful ‘thank you’ I’d ever heard in my life. I said ‘no problem’ and walked away. Meanwhile in my head, I’m thinking: *… HUH? Didn’t you just lose a leg last week - and you’re at work?!*

I do not bring any of this up to my coworkers because, well, they never talk about these things. In fact, I’ve observed them - as well as everyone else on the hospital staff - saying hi to these two particular people like… everything is totally normal? 

At that point, I was thinking: okay, this is just two people. Just two. Kinda strange, but there are hundreds, maybe a thousand employees at this hospital? These just happen to be the two staff members with stuff going on.

That was Friday. I come back to work the next week, and I encounter grumpy woman again in the ICU - but today, she wasn’t nearly as grumpy. I was actually seeing her smiling for the first time, and that smile got bigger when she saw me. A subtle feeling of unease came over me.

She was leaning against the wall, visibly exhausted. Her eyes were somewhat pink. “Hey… were you the one I… that I yelled at the other day?” she asked with a warble in her voice. “Yes, but don’t worry about it,” I said. “I totally get it.” 

She slowly raises her arm and points a finger to the ceiling - slowly, like her brain is running on 10%. *Absolutely* high on something. “Okay, but… I want you to know something… that that is not who I am, that I am sorry I did that, and that that is not who I am…” she said. The ICU’s desk was right beside us, and the folks there were typing away on their computers. Seemingly a helluva lot more sober than this woman, and seemingly could care less that this RN was on something. I remember thinking the word *‘unbelievable’* over and over again in my head, because it was/is.

Before the end of day, I saw two more people I recognized as staff members, *now as patients,* when I was passing through rehab. One was a food associate I recognized from being the designated food tray runner, and the other was an RN from med surg. The food guy was at the end of the hall, groaning in a wheelchair, and the RN was talking quietly to another RN at the edge of her bed, the first room when you get into rehab. So at this point I’m thinking the hospital has got to be terrible with safety, or something like that. Huge red flag.

But I can’t quit, because I live in a rural area. My options are extremely limited - and like I said, I’m a bit of a job sl\*t… so my reputation for reliability isn’t the greatest, either.

The next day, I see the food associate in rehab again. He’s still in a wheelchair at the end of the hall(it looked like he literally hadn’t moved) - but now he looks roughed up, with a cast on one arm, and is snoring like a baby. I am 100% sure he did not have that cast on the night before.

I did not see the other RN that day, her door was closed.

I passed frosted tips guy and ‘grumpy’ woman several more times this week, spaced out - as had become the norm. Frosted tips guy did say ‘hello’ randomly one day in a very sing-song way. He was starting to give me an uneasy feeling. But needless to say, so wasn’t everyone else.

Week 3.

Guess who I saw running trays again on Monday, totally cast free? And you wouldn’t believe who I saw back working in med surg… Both of them in much ‘better spirits.’ 

At this point, I’m telling myself I’m only here for the money, and the money only. That means I’m here to work for it, and only work for it. I’ve been keeping conversations minimal; elevator rides are now awkwardly silent, but I am totally okay with that. I’m not here to make friends. Not dipping any toes in that pool. I need to leave this place ASAP.

I think I may have sped up the process of the inevitable by becoming so distant, though. When I’d first started working and had awkward moments in the elevator, the other person riding with me(or occasionally myself) would say something to make it not awkward(usually something regarding work that lightly scrapes the surface of funny). But now on the elevator, the rides had become silent. I’ll feel my cohorts eyes on me… This doesn’t just feel awkward, it feels judgmental. Cold. I tried to break the tension with this one guy(whose exact job title I’m honestly not sure of) who is always chill and personable when I pass him. I asked him how his day was going, and all he said back was: “Good.” His tone of voice and dull eyes expressed the polar opposite of ‘chill’, that being flat. Empty. Not interested. Like he’d been working there forever and absolutely hates his life, and today was a really bad day. I’d dismissed it as being that, because he didn’t seem high. He never did.

Interactions with others went similar to this, though. Monotonous and mono-worded. Stink eyes all around.

Internally, I really couldn’t dismiss all of it. I knew something was up. I was working towards getting out of there in less than a months time from then(I didn’t tell them, of course).

Week 4.

I don’t remember…

My phone has more than half battery life left. So long as I am confined to this bed, I will be trying to upload this until its used up.

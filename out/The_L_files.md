You know when you was little and you used get scared over stupid things like going to the toilet at night without the light on or having to put rubbish in the bin outside? Fearing that a crazed criminal or some mythical monster would come and get you, or some massive scary ghost was going to come and jump out at you? It seems stupid looking back on it but you realise you never truly outgrow these fears you just come up with an excuse for why there was footsteps coming up the stairs, that the massive bang you heard was just an animal and that the person you see at the end of your bed isn't actually a person it's just your coat hanging up on the wardrobe right?! There couldn't possibly be a person stood there staring at you?? Could there??

Wellllllllll sorry to burst your bubble guys but it's true they're real, some of them are actually quite friendly even if they have blood dripping down their faces and teeth the size of your thumbs..... Anyway, my name's well we'll go with my name being L I can't actually tell you my full name GDPR or a breach of contract or some crap I don't know, but every adult loves a horror story and what's better than confirming your inner childhood fears and making you constantly looking over your shoulder yayyyy!!

So I thought I'd tell you a few story's from my line of work to help you feel a bit more at ease with your hellish roommates, firstly I better tell you what I actually do formal introductions and all that jazz, my momma always told me to be polite.
So as I've already said my name's L, I work for a company in the well I guess "supernatural surveillance and medicinal trials" would be the best way to describe it, the branch I'm employed for is based in the UK we're worldwide and that's as much information as I can give on the company itself.

The first anomaly I'll talk about is what we like to call CZ-6P orrrr more commonly known by the less by the book employees 'the crawler' oooo spooky I know.
The crawler is something everyone, every single person on this planet has seen.
The best example of when you've seen this little cutie, is when you're lay down on your bed let's say, and you see something dart across the floor out the corner of your eye, just a quick flash across the floor and then it's gone. You'll see it a couple of times that day and then not again for a few months. 
The crawler is similar to a spider, it takes the form of a six legged araneae they're usually dark brown some of them purple, with the cutest little beady eyes.

The crawler is relatively harmless, I say relatively because there well there's a slight, tiny almost impossible possibility of bites, but that's only when you're really really tasty.
The crawler is one of the most common anomalous creatures we have on the books, it feeds on fear and adrenaline which is why they thrive on hiding just in sight of humans.
After they've fed on your adrenaline they store the rest for us to harvest, we then use this to examine what really gets a human heart going, what sort of fear gets you sweating, blood rushing to your head leaving you shaking.

You see fear, no matter what brings it on holds every bit of information each person is scared by, we use this to try and bypass that fear, to study it and control it. So far we've managed to control fear of dying, heights and sponges, don't ask.
We then use the crawler to release these fear blockers, they kinda throw up on you while you sleep (sorry) and then our "security team" throw you into situations you'd usually be scared by obviously this is done as a purely "coincidental" part of life, like having your dog run to the top of a building making you look down.
With every 8/10 people we've tried this on its worked as expected, the other 2 well let's just say It's had less than desired effects, but we're still working on it.
No one's died yet anyway.

I'll see if I can find some photos of this little critter to show you but for now I've got to get back to my paperwork we've just had a bad case of a rogue JXOP and trust me those things are the bloody worst. If you guys have any questions drop them down below and I'll reply when I can.

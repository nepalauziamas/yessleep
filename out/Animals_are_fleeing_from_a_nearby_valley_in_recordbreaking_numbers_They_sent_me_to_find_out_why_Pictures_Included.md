The reports began flooding in early yesterday afternoon. Bears, deer, elk, and even smaller creatures like squirrels and skunks had been spotted fleeing from the Stefford Valley in historic numbers. 

The only known cause of such a mass migration was a forest fire, but a thick fog hanging over the valley prevented our helicopters from getting a good view of the forest. When the helicopter couldn’t get a visual, they sent in me and Jim, two forest rangers, to check the area for fires or other potential sources of the disturbance.

The fog covering the road made winding up the mountain pass in our rickety Forest Service Jeep even more nerve-wracking. We’d have waited for the conditions to improve, but the risk of a potential forest fire meant we had to act now.

“There’s no way it was a fire,” Jim said, gripping the steering wheel tightly as he pulled around another curve.

“What else could explain the animal migration?” I asked.

He shook his head. “I don’t know, but… I mean, just look out there. We’re in the middle of the rainy season. It’s so humid that the fog is still hanging around at--” he looked at his watch. “10 AM. Fire just doesn’t fit.”

I peered out the window at the trees peeking through the fog. Jim was right, but I supposed it didn’t matter. Either way, we had a job to do. 

When Jim pulled off the side of the road, we readied our equipment. A GPS to track our location, sensors that checked the air for smoke, and a can of bear spray each, just in case. When we were ready, we left the road behind and began walking into the woods.

The fog hung heavy in the air, but soon the trees pressed in tight enough that they blocked our vision instead. After a few minutes of walking, we stumbled across a game trail carved into the ground and began following it instead. I held my sensor out, constantly checking for smoke. There was nothing.

Jim walked ahead of me as I scanned the air in another direction for signs of a fire. When I turned to look at him, he paused, then asked, “Do you hear that?” 

I paused, listening hard. I did hear it. A scuttling sound came from our left, like a cockroach on kitchen tiles. A multi-legged creature leaped from behind a tree and ran towards us. Jim brought his foot down hard on the creature with a wet crunch. 

When he lifted his foot, it exposed an absolutely massive spider. It must’ve been over a foot in diameter. I knelt down, examining the body closely. 

“This is incredible,” I breathed. 

“Incredible that a spider the size of a dinner plate just tried to eat us?” Jim asked, still breathing hard.

“No, incredible that a spider this big exists. Arachnids were my specialty in college. Australia has the biggest spiders in the world, but I didn’t think even Australian spiders grew this big.”

Jim stood up and looked around. “Well, that explains the migration. Invasive spider species arrives, starts eating all the small mammals, disrupts the ecosystem, it all fits.”

“Yeah, makes sense.” I got to my feet, then shook my head. Another invasive species. It had the potential to disrupt the entire food chain if it spread to other areas. I looked up at Jim. “We should still probably check to make sure there wasn’t a fire. In the meantime, keep an eye out for any webs or other spiders. If we can identify exactly which species this is, it’ll help the bosses plan for it.”

We continued deeper into the forest, stopping periodically to check for forest smoke. There was nothing, of course. I was relatively sure we’d found the answer to our riddle. When another slightly smaller spider ran away, I motioned for Jim to follow me after it. I hoped it’d lead us to a web or perhaps to a few of its eggs. 

The spider scurried around a thick mossy tree. I walked around the corner and came to a stop, mesmerized by a new sight. A black mass the size of a car was strung up in a web between the branches of the tree. The black mass writhed as the spider we’d been chasing climbed up the web and disturbed it.

That’s when I realized what I was seeing.

It was hundreds, maybe thousands, of the spiders. They were all clumped together in the tree, similar to how baby spiders clump together. You can watch this video to get a very small-scale idea of what I mean:

“Oh. My. God,” Jim whispered from behind me. 

We slowly backed up down the game trail as the mass of spiders continued to uncoil.

“Those…” I said. My mind couldn’t fathom what I was seeing. I understood the number of spiders, I understood the behavior of the clumping. No, what I didn’t understand was something else. 

“Those are all babies,” I said. “Only baby spiders clump up like that.”

Jim turned to stare at me, wide-eyed. “If these are the babies, then where is the…” He trailed off, then we both turned to take off down the game trail in the other direction. I thought I heard skittering coming from all around us, so we didn’t slow down until the end of the game trail.

Jim fumbled at his coat for the GPS tracker so we could find our path back to the car. “Come on,” I urged.

A muted thump echoed from through the trees, larger, heavier than we’d heard before. Another thump. They continued, each time faster and closer. 

Jim turned and ran through the woods. I followed close behind, my adrenaline pushing me to keep up. We burst from the tree line and made it to the Jeep. Jim threw it into drive and started heading down the road. 

I pulled out my phone’s camera and turned around, taking a picture of the still-foggy road behind us. 

This is the picture I took:

We’re driving back right now. All I can say is, if you live in the woods of western Virginia, you should be aware there's [something in the woods nearby.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WorchesterStreet/comments/gbpc8t/a_huge_storm_swept_through_my_town_a_week_ago_it/)

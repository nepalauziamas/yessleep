At first, I thought the shooting star would collide with the hill I was sitting on; its trajectory, arcing Earthward from an otherwise starless night sky, seemed destined for the great hill I often found myself resting on late at night; when I’m—as my friend would put it—*stuck in my feelings.* I was, admittedly, a bit sadder than usual, so the night concluding with my star-sent obliteration wouldn’t have necessarily been a terrible or surprising way to end it. But fortuitously—or maybe not, depending on how you see this story’s end—the meteorite curved downward at the last moment, plummeting violently into the field below the hill and sending up a great plume of smoke, and scattering bits of blackened earth in every direction.  

From my vantage at the top of the hill, I could clearly see the smoldering impact site, and marveled at the proximity and scale of the destruction; was rendered dumbstruck at how close I had come to simply being annihilated by mere cosmic chance. Eventually, the smoke cleared somewhat, and I was able to get a look at what exactly had fallen from the heavens; and my previous relief at being spared a fiery death was ejected; wholly replaced by a mounting terror and fear of a new, previously unimagined demise. 

Within the black-rimmed crater, stirring amidst the smoke and molten debris, was a creature—a horror—from some unmapped sector of the great abyssal gulf beyond Earth.  

Smoke cleared to reveal dark, leathery flesh, wrapped tautly around a massive, grotesquely bulbous skull, the entire structure riddled with...eyes, or glazed, orb-like projections resembling sight organs. Veritable magma fell away from a body that was, to my best (see: completely uniformed) guesses, some genetic cross-mixture between a scorpion and a salamander. Its body was a triply segmented trunk from which kicked and spasmed six reptilian limbs. The whole abominable thing was slick with a clear, sparkling mucous, as if newborn of some celestial womb. A tail, jet-black, undulant, and laterally spiked along the entirety of its length, flicked away what remained of the smoke, revealing the wholesale horribleness of the alien entity.  

The thing was massive, would’ve dwarfed a school bus, and it was no surprise that it had survived atmospheric entry; the sheer bulk of its body, coupled with the obviously heat-resistant flesh, proved that it could sustain and withstand incredible damage. Shaking away what little disorientation it had suffered from its landfall, it rose from the still-burning crater, rearing itself almost elegantly into the moon-illumined night. Perched upon the crater's rim, its frame whitely gilded in the lunar glow, it reminded me of some angelic image I'd seen as a child above an altar at church; though there was plainly nothing angelic about its cosmically inhuman presence.  

Somehow both awestruck and terrified, I sat petrified atop the hill, initially ignorant to the sudden cold that had arisen at the emergence of the ultra-terrestrial creature. Soon, the crater beneath it cooled, the flames dying out with startling swiftness; and then the earth, once super-heated by the kinetic destruction carried out against it, likewise chilled—and then froze; the volcanic rock hardening and frosting over in a matter of seconds. The creature, consciously or naturally, possessed some kind of cooling ability; emitted an invisible but incredibly powerful coolant from its alien pores.  

After a few moments of basking in the lunar light, it lowered itself onto the level, partially scorched ground beyond the crater; and despite the grace with which it carried out this simple maneuver, the earth shook with its landing. The lizard-like claws sank into earth, but the creature, upon settling itself, found no difficulty in traversing the earthen soil; it quickly scuttled a few yards forward, directly toward the hill on which I was sitting.  

The sensory organs embedded in its hairless, globular head quickly found me, and at the recognition of my personhood in relation to the otherwise unpeopled environment the creature began its ascent of the hill. This ascent amounted to little more than a small climb for its colossal frame, and upon summiting the hill (which had taken me about two full minutes to climb) it inclined its body forward so that it loomed imposingly over me; its form blotting out the moon, and throwing a tenebrous shadow over the peak. 

The eyes, nightmarishly fixated on me, seemed to peer beyond my flesh, scrutinizing my very soul, and I felt my mind or spirit shrink inward; knowing that there was no hiding my physical body from the omni-eyed monstrosity. For a while, it simply stared, regarding me with an almost palpable misanthropy; and then, when I thought I’d lose my mind (or bladder) beneath that abysmal gaze, a slit in its head appeared; and the structure laterally opened, the top half rising like the lid of a box; revealing an interior composed of pink pulsating flesh and long wriggling feelers, slick with a crimson slime.  

One of these feelers slowly emerged from the cephalic opening, and before I could comprehend its purpose, it shot toward me, leaving a blood-like trail through the air in its wake. Unable to react fast enough, I was struck in the face by the feeler, which felt like the tongue of some perpetually salivating dog. Despite having come from the thing’s head—which would, presumably, be warm—the slime with which the feeler was coated was surprisingly cold; I shivered and wrapped my limbs around my body when the viscous stuff dripped onto me. I would’ve clambered away, not expecting to escape but at least to distance myself from the loathsome feelers, but it had, upon contact, immobilized me; and I surmised that the slime’s purpose was probably anesthetic.  

I briefly feared that the appendage would then bore into my skull and suck out my brains; it wasn’t an unreasonable fear, given the circumstances. But even as it held firm to my forehead, I felt no sensations of penetration; my thoughts weren’t suddenly clouded or diminished. Before and above me, the great horror did start to tremble a little; something was clearly happening, and I tried to think of something to do—some way to appease or placate the alien before it finished whatever monstrous process it had begun.  

But then, without any actual prompting or pleading on my part, the feeler was abruptly retracted, and freedom of movement returned to me. Rather than get up and run, I quickly went about rubbing my arms and legs, hoping to return some warmth to the nearly frozen limbs. The alien’s trembling went on a little longer, and then, as abruptly as the feeler had been retracted, it stopped, and lowered itself a little, so that its inordinate and ungodly head was level with the crest of the hill—*with me.*  

There was a smell, which I hadn’t initially noticed—perhaps due to the effects of my immense fear—that suddenly and violently seized me; rendering me almost totally incoherent. It was nauseating, miasmal, worse, I imagined, than the tomb-sealed funk of a thousand rotting corpses.  

I reeled back, blasted by wave after wave of the wind-swept fetor; but the alien, perhaps thinking that I was trying to escape, emitted a low, earth-rattling growl, from some unseen orifice amidst the eye-studded face. I stiffened in place; my repulsion overridden by new levels of terror.  

Apparently satisfied with my obedience, the alien straightened a little, and a few of its hatefully glaring eyes closed, making it appear somewhat relaxed.  

And then, from the same unseen orifice, it spoke, emitting a voice not dissimilar in overall tone to the sonic chaos of a sunk ship buckling under the pressures of the deep.  

“You—you will be the first upon whom I test my methods for the destruction of the human race. I, Cianae, Cold Bleeder, have come to end the people of Earth before they can merge into a single mass of being—*as many of their biologic nature have done on other worlds*. I have taken your language to give voice to your demise—these words augur the coming of the **boreal death**.”  

I was understandably speechless. I hadn’t thought for a moment that the thing would speak; wouldn’t have guessed, among all the terrible possibilities, that its first action would be to scan my brain for the words needed to announce its mission.  

When it became obvious—by its languidly blinking eyes—that it awaited an answer, I regained a miniscule amount of composure and said, “But why?” It wasn’t the best reply, and it had technically said *why* it had come, but I figured it would understand the broader connotations of the word; plus I was still to shaken to offer anything more substantial.  

“Your kind, beings of mortal flesh, all eventually coalescence into a single entity if they survive long enough. It is the ultimate goal of a species’ evolution: the culmination, or rather the elimination, of its most vexing needs: procreation and survival. When all are one, there needn’t be struggles over resources. Survival simply occurs, effortlessly, and procreation is achieved seamlessly from within. Self-propagation, self-fulfillment, biological perfection. I cannot allow such perfection; organic life as you know it is despicable, hideous, an affront to the sensibilities of *beings beyond your ken*. I am an outrider of the stars, emissary of the nadir dwellers, sent to annihilate those who would dare become something greater.”  

I wanted to laugh at its statement that humanity was hideous, considering its own ghastly appearance, but I knew that any insolence whatsoever would probably result in my agonizing end; and while it had already spoken of its intent to destroy all of humanity, I didn’t want to be the first to go. Instead, I asked it why it was telling me this; why it hadn’t simply swept across the world, freezing everything in its wake—assuming that’s how it planned to carry out the anthropocide.  

Despite the lack of anything resembling a mouth (not counting the tendril-filled face-slit, which hadn’t moved with its words) I got the impression that it had, briefly, smiled at my comment; before again speaking in its imploding metal voice:  

“Because, while I could easily render your species extinct from afar, I on occasion like to personally visit with a planet’s doom-pronounced people, to learn what I can of them. I am also, among other things, a scholar.”  

Feeling a little emboldened by the fact that I was having a conversation with a literal alien, I promptly responded, “Well, what did you learn from me?”  

The slit in its face opened a little more, and I saw the scarlet tendrils therein writhe chaotically, as if in excitement at the upcoming revelation:  

“I learned that, more than any other, your species is emotionally dependent upon companionship. You crave it, thrive on it, and are, pitifully, lost without it.”  

Just then, before I could offer anything in the way of a response, the gigantic head spat forth a great glob of crimson slime, coating the crown of the hill. I scrambled back, unsure of what effects it might have on my skin, but stopped my retreat prematurely, lest it be misinterpreted as a full-on flight from the area. I didn’t want to be shot in the back by some caustic projectile, or whipped clean in half by a tendril.  

The red sludge bubbled a little on the ground, then, incredibly, began to take shape; rising from the earth with a sickening autonomy. I watched, again rendered speechless and immobile—but this time by the sheer dreadful spectacle of it—as the figure of a woman soon took form; first featureless, and then developing the aspects and finer physical minutiae of a twenty-something-year-old female. After only a few moments, a fully grown woman stood before me, auburn hair falling lossely over her shoulders, amber eyes sparkling beautifully to spontaneous sentient life, and then darting nervously around the area; arms crossing clumsily to shield her well-formed nakedness from the fear-stricken man standing awkwardly before her.  

Recognition came at once, and I let out a sort of stuttered half-chuckle; in complete disbelief of the situation. Satisfied by my reaction, the alien let out some grating approximation of a laugh, and then, before she could even turn to see from where the harsh sound had come, sent out its tendrils and seized the paradoxically newborn woman around the waist.  

Speaking, even as it held the woman aloft in its tongue-like appendages, it mocked:  

“And I’ve learned that seeing the ones you cherish die is perhaps the most awful pain of all; that the resultant trauma can, in the most extreme cases, drive the bereaved to take their own life. Yes, for Earth I plan to inflict this particularly acute form of psychological pain upon billions, at once, to see just how many I can drive to their own ends—before I blast the planet into a state of utter, frigid lifelessness with my ultra-terrene cold.’ 

Cruelly, malevolently, it shook the ensnared woman; who, having no idea what was going on, screamed with a mounting hysteria. 

“Now witness the end of your world—as you know it.”  

Without mercy, in an act of ultimate obscenity, it pulled apart the woman mid-scream; sending limbs and organs and blood raining haphazardly onto the surface of the hill.  

When the gruesome show had concluded, and there was nothing left but two limply sagging scraps of flesh, it tossed the near-bloodless remains away; leaving the hill-scattered remains the only evidence that a woman had (briefly) existed.  

The gore steamed, and my heart sank at the intensity of the accompanying smell; it rivaled in awfulness the sepulchral stench that had arisen and taken hold of my senses at the arrival of the star-fiend. 

I was of course appalled, disgusted, repulsed by the merciless display of ultra-violence. But I was *not* grief-stricken; the woman’s death hadn’t hurt me on a personal level.  

Because the woman wasn’t *real*—and I don’t just mean the fact that she had been born of the alien’s slime.  

But that the woman had *never* been real, that she was a fictional character—one I have, since adolescence, “loved”; as much as a guy could love a fictional character.  

Somehow, the creature wasn’t aware of this, despite having probed the very depths of my mind. 

When I didn’t break out into tears or lament the woman’s death, the creature trembled a little, and a few of its closed eyes opened, as if to try and detect some subtler suggestion of the missing grief it had been expecting.  

“Hmm, why do you not cry and mourn for the dead woman? You’ve just watched your beloved be viciously ripped apart.” Its voice, whilst still discomforting, faltered a little; a small measure of uncertainty detectable in its otherwise callous remark. 

I sat quietly for a moment, thinking of how best to respond, how best to explain why I seemed so inhumanly sociopathic regarding the butchering of the helpless woman. 

“Do you know why I’ve been sitting on this hill?”  

The creature’s eyes blinked in unsettling unison, which I took as its version of shaking its head no.  

“Because I’m lonely. I’m lonely because I don’t have a girlfriend—a companion. That woman you so disgustingly conjured and mutilated wasn’t a real person—she's a fictional character from a video game. Do you know what that is? Do you understand why I wouldn’t necessarily be grief-stricken by her death? It was a cruel, terrible thing to do, sure—but that thing, that *image,* wasn’t anyone I ever truly knew.”  

The creature’s eyes then all started blinking sporadically; while the slit-embedded tendrils went rigid and dry, falling from the orifice to hang limply beneath its chin, like a blood-soaked beard.  For a moment, it looked as if it was suffering from some kind of palsy or catalepsy, the body alternating between states of extreme physical unrest and statuesque rigidity. This physiological chaos went on for quite some time, and I considered finally taking the opportunity to run away, but an inkling of smugness kept me rooted in place. I wanted to see if the thing would die; if I had, with my apathy, induced in it some kind of lethal shock or seizure.  

But to my dismay, its bodily turbulence eventually subsided, and the alien almost immediately regained its former deathly composure. Speaking in its normal, terrible timbre, it said:  

“Well, that is quite pathetic, even a little unnerving. The love you harbor for that.... character...is profound, *real*, stronger than many bonds I’ve felt between the most synchronous partners of other sapient species. You even acknowledge the pointlessness of it, the unreality of her being, and yet you still persist in these feelings. Surely, you must be some kind of human anomaly; some emotional degenerate; a religiously profaned and socially hated outcast? You must be alone in this kind of wretched behavior?” 

 My smugness flickered out, and in its place a sadness bordering on despair flared within. Raising my head to meet the eyes of the alien, I responded, “You’d be surprised just how many of us feel this way. How many of us have resorted to loving unreal, inanimate things; either because we are, as you said, ‘degenerates’ in one way or another, or because we don’t think we deserve love...Others simply can’t hold onto it, and resort to desperate means to fulfill that nagging need. I’m not surprised that the apex form of an organic species is a singular, collective entity. Loneliness is a bitch, man.”  

The alien’s eyes blinked languidly for a few moments; the implied expression inscrutable to my tired mind. Then, presumably making up its mind after a moment of contemplation, it reared back, again presenting itself in an almost regal, majestic fashion. Beautifully framed in the radiant moonlight, it retracted its feelers, closed its head, and spoke one final time:  

“I do not think I will end this world—not today. If even a few of you are like that, so wretchedly lonely and convinced of being terminally unlovable, then I do not think I need worry about your species forming a great and dangerous collective. You are a depressing people, that much is apparent. There are other species in the far reaches of this very galaxy who show greater potential for annihilation—who are more worthy of the *implacable frost.*  

Goodbye, human—and, I suppose, good luck.”  

Rising from the ground through some means of telekinetic levitation, it then turned skyward and flew away; leaving me alone atop the hill with the cooling remains of Lara Croft.

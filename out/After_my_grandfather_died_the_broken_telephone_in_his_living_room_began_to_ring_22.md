As the clock on the mantle slowly tick, tick, ticked toward evening, I found myself inadvertently duplicating my grandfathers' after-dinner routine. Make a cup of chamomile tea— two cubes of sugar, no cream—, grab a shortbread cookie or two from the aluminum tin next to the stove, take a seat on the wingback chair, and enjoy the flames dancing in the fireplace. Except, this evening, I was also waiting impatiently for a broken telephone to ring so that I could speak to a man who died in 1965. Which was. of course, a ridiculous thing to be doing. I was fairly certain that this was not part of my grandfathers' routine. I was also fairly certain that I had imagined the entire conversation from the previous night. Some sort of strange hallucination brought on by grief. 

I planned to sit near the phone and munch on three, maybe four, shortbread cookies for ten or twenty minutes maximum. When the phone inevitably did not ring, I would take myself to bed and pretend that none of this had ever happened. Because it hadn't. Louis was dead and dead people do not make phone calls. I nodded confidently, convincing myself that I had successfully convinced myself that I was delusional. 

Within five minutes of sitting in the comfortable velvet chair, I had finished eating my cookies and drinking my tea, leaving me with nothing to occupy my fidgety hands. Once again, I turned to the dusty photo album. This time for entertainment rather than information. Simply sitting in silence, waiting for Louis to call, or not call, was beginning to make me nervous. I was seriously beginning to question my sanity as I marinated in a heavy silence, foot tapping rapidly on the carpet below. My clammy hands flipped open the photo album. I turned past multiple pages filled with grainy color photos of my mother as a child, settling once again on the black and white photo of my grandfather and the boy I now knew to be Louis. I hadn't really looked at it earlier. Not in any detail. 

They were very young in this photo. Maybe eight or nine. They stood in front of a small white house, arms wrapped around one another, smiling. How strange that my grandfather had once been a child. And Louis, too. Although he never even made it to thirty. Sadness bubbled through my guts at the thought. I traced a finger around his bearded face on the obituary stuck in a pocket on the opposite page. What if he did call? I suddenly felt suffocated by the weight of the daunting task before me. A task for which I was wholly unqualified—to tell Louis that he had, in fact, been dead for nearly sixty years. I wondered if it was possible for dead men to feel the pain of a broken heart. Droplets of salty tears fell from my cheeks to the leg of my pants as I jumped inadvertently at the sharp sound of the telephone ringing. 

My outstretched hand hovered shakily over the mouthpiece of the old telephone. I took a deep breath, attempting to calm my nerves, and keep my voice from shaking. Finally, I summoned enough courage to grab the mouthpiece. Holding the receiver of the candlestick telephone to my ear, I was greeted by a cheery voice before I could even open my mouth to utter a greeting of my own. 

“Good evening, Eliz—“

“You are dead” I interjected, almost shouting into the handheld mouthpiece.

“As a doornail!” he confirmed in a voice that sounded entirely too chipper for this subject matter. “Or is it doorknob?” 

I was shocked by his reply. My brain sputtered like a rusty motorcycle engine as I tried to make sense of this surreal response. I will admit that I expected him to be surprised and dismayed by the news of his untimely death. I suppose I took too long to come up with an answer because he impatiently repeated himself.

“Hello? Doornail? Or doorknob?”

“Uh... doornail. I think” I replied with as much confidence as I could muster under the circumstances.

“Ah, very good,” he said, followed by an uncharacteristically long silence. “My condolences... about Warren. He was a good man and a remarkable friend to me for, well, let’s see... coming up on seventy-four years.”

Again, I found myself shocked by the words coming through the receiver. I removed it from my ear and glanced at it briefly, as though I expected to see some sort of evidence confirming that I was hearing incorrectly. Seventy-four years? That isn’t possible. Well, technically none of this should be possible but that length of time seemed especially unrealistic.

“Seventy-four years?” I repeated. “But Louis... you’re, well you were only twenty-eight when... you know. When you died.”

“Pah!” he chortled. He really was in an extraordinarily good mood for someone who had been dead for almost six decades.

 “Yes, it’s true. I was twenty-eight when I died. And I suppose I still am, technically. But the friendship... our friendship didn’t end in 1965. No, no,” he chided. "Our friendship couldn't be ended by something as trivial as a car accident."

At this, my mind flashed back to my most cherished memory of my grandfather. Him and I in the velvet chair, laughing uproariously at the hilarity of a fake phone call. Except, I understand now, it wasn't fake. My head spun. My vision blurred. I was lucky to be sitting down already, or I likely would have collapsed to the floor at my sudden realization. The photo album. He was showing me a black and white photo. The photo of him and Louis together, happy, as children. 

“But that would mean...” I thought out loud in a whisper, hoping Louis would jump in and save me from speaking the outrageous conclusion into existence on my own.  Thankfully, Louis isn’t—wasn’t?—a very patient man so that didn’t take long.

“Yup, we have had some really fantastic conversations, your grandfather and I. We spoke most every night. Except, of course, when he was busy entertaining you. He did love having you over, you know? He talked about you frequently.” 

He said all of this in an absurdly calm manner as if it were the most normal thing in the world to be a ghost conversing with a living human on the other end of the telephone. I guess it probably was normal. To him anyway. I, on the other hand, was having an understandably difficult time digesting the fact that my grandfather had maintained a long-distance friendship with a ghost and never thought to mention it to anyone. Or maybe he had told me, that night by the fireplace. Beads of sweat gathered on my forehead as my mind fought to comprehend the absurdity of the conversation I was having. 

“Louis...” I said in a cool, even tone, attempting to match his nonchalant attitude despite my own internal frenzy. “Can I call you tomorrow? I think I need some time to process... this.”

“No,” he responded, as if the answer should be obvious. “But I can call you.” 

The call abruptly ended with a click. He had hung up without saying goodbye but that didn’t really bother me. I wasn’t feeling bothered by much of anything at that moment. The inside of my head felt fuzzy like television static as I slumped forward in the wingback chair, still barely holding the telephone mouthpiece in the fingertips of my limp hand.

He did call back the next evening, as promised. By then, I had managed to digest the reality of the situation enough to facilitate a productive conversation. We talked about my grandfather, What he meant to each of us. How much we missed him. I confided in him that I was feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of caring for the collection of antiques my grandfather had accumulated over the course of his life. Louis understood and encouraged me to do what I felt was best. My grandfather had trusted me and I should trust myself, he said. Louis was a lovely conversationalist. I suppose he had had quite a bit of practice. As the discussion reached a natural end, we said our goodbyes and resolved to speak again the next night. And the next. 

Ultimately, I chose to keep only the telephone, the end table, and the chair. They now occupy a cozy corner of my own modest home, close to the fireplace, of course. The velvet ghost of my grandfather has all but been erased from the cushion of the wingback chair, replaced by the distinct impression of my own silhouette. Everything else was sold to carefully vetted collectors or donated to a select few museums. I feel satisfied that the antiques are being well cared for by people who appreciate them as much as my grandfather once did. 

“Warren would be pleased with the care you put into managing his estate, I’m sure,” Louis declared one evening. His assurances were warm and comforting like a handmade quilt around my heart, slowly melting away the bitter cold left behind at the loss of a loved one. Louis and I have come to know each other well, having spent many hours swapping stories of my grandfather and of our own short lives. 

The broken telephone rings less often now than it used to. 

But when it does, I always answer.

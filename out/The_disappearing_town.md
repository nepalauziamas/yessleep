 

Hi. I am Ugyenmo. I am from Bhutan, but I moved to the United States for my job four months ago as an Asian Studies professor. A special fact about me is that I have a mole under my right ear. But well, it doesn’t matter where I come from or who I am. I am here at r/nosleep because I have a story to tell. And I am really hoping this won’t be removed or deleted. I really hope it will not prevent me from reaching out to the outside world.

So the town I am living in is—it’s a little bit strange. I had traveled to many cities in the United States before coming here, and I don't know how to describe it, but I could see this aura of life in other cities...But here, this town seems to be devoid of that particular aura. It feels empty. It feels as if this town is the embodiment of a void that only consumes.

America has about 4000 ghost towns, and this surely couldn’t be considered one. Of course there were people—students from the university I was teaching, older people who would live with their family, seniors, and all sorts—but they never really came out. I would park my car a little bit far from my classes because I liked walking and didn’t want to pay for the parking, so I noticed that I never saw a soul around those houses on my four months of constant walking to classes. So it spooked me out a bit, but I didn’t mind it.

It was a normal fall day for me until a girl, let’s call her Belinda, showed up to class without any head. Her head basically had disappeared. Of course, nobody paid any notice. So I also ignored that. During class, it was not very convenient to find yourself being stared at by a headless student, but again, the lack of reaction from other students already made it clear that she wasn't really here so I played along.

After the class was over, I asked the other professors and teacher if they knew a girl named Belinda. They all said no. I even went to the length of checking her records at the admission office, but still no Belinda. But I had her quiz paper from the last exam and the exam before that where she had written "Belinda" in cursive his definitely made no sense. *Was she a ghost?* I wondered. I never had ability to see ghosts. So seeing a headless "ghost" was very weird. 

That day, I was already running late, so I ran to my car very desperate to get out of here. At the crack of dusk, I felt as if the houses that I was seeing since past four months were changing colors. I thought I was dreaming when a house that looked only a year old seemed to have rusted doors and a yard full of overgrown ferns and liverworts. The perfectly paved streets that I used to walk seemed to be the turned into a narrow trail leading towards a thick deep forest of old rusted twisted houses

 This has to be it. I am losing my mind, I thought. I silently prayed to God to rid me of whatever was going on. I ran fast without even stopping to catch my breath. The path  in front of me looked never-ending. Taking the turn, I ran to my car, which also for some reason looked very old and dusty as if it had been there since time immemorial. I was on the verge of a panic attack. I gathered all the strength that was left in me to get inside the car.

Yes, I had not yet been harmed yet. But I felt very creeped out. as if I was disturbing whatever was in here. as if I was disturbing the order. I felt out of place and out of time. So I started my car and drove towards my house at full speed. The view of houses became hazy. After 20 minutes of driving, I finally reached my parking lot, but after parking, I felt very tired, as if all of my panic had finally enveloped me, and before I knew it, I passed out.

This morning, I woke up and went to my apartment as usual. But something has changed. No matter how much I tried, I couldn’t get in. My keys almost got stuck, but it still didn’t open. There were people walking across me, my neighbors, but they didn't look at me. All the shame and embarrassment had disappeared I was bawling in front of my apartment.. I tried asking the security if they had any spare keys, but he gave no response. He did look at me, but now I noticed It looked as if it were staring through me at something far in the distance.

*Did I disappear too?* A chill ran through my spine. I went to the nearest washroom and examined my reflection. My head was not there; it was completely gone, and so was the mole.

So why am I writing this all to you? Because I am going back to that town again. Why? I don't know. But I feel like I should. I know whatever it was, it took my head, and it twisted that city that night. I am not sure if I am alive or dead. For now, I still feel human, just headless. I still eat from the void that was once my mouth. I am not seen by anyone, but right now, as you are reading this, I really, really hope you can see me inside of your head—my headless face. Please know that I am real and I am out there. Please help me. Please.

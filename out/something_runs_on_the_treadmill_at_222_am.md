I thought this might be a chance to fix things, save the man who died.


I wasn't his main coach so i didn't know his name, I had to get information on him, I went through the system and there he was, Alex Tucker, he didn't come to me often but I could see that he was a pretty hard worker.


That day I went back home, I didn't sleep, I couldn't, knowing that a man is gonna die tomorrow and I was the only one that could save him, I remember my boss called me in the afternoon, so I had to get there in the morning, at 10 o'clock I went in, they didn't let me in.


They said the place was under construction, I could clearly see it wasn't, I insisted to go in, the threatened to call the police.


I went outside and knew there was a backdoor, the people who kicked me didn't know I work there, since they were the morning shift, I went in through the fire escape and went to the lockers sneakingly.


**My body froze in its place.**


**My heart beats were loud and fast.**


**I couldn't move or breathe.**


**I saw Alex.**


But that wasn't a human anymore, his skin was seperated from his body, the lights were red and there were rightings I couldn't understand on the walls, he was.... **He was a sacrifice**


"You have seen the creature, haven't you?"


I physically was unable to move.


"ANSWER ME" I heard again.


"Wh- Wha- What, What d-do you mean?" I said


I saw a figure, it was my boss emerging from the shadows.


"Have you seen the creature, at 2:22 am?"


"H-How do yo-you know?"


"Its been here, for a very long time, it's been hungry, very very hungry"


"What the h-hell have you done?"


"Oh this poor soul had to go, or else it would be mad"


"WHAT THE HELL DO YOU MEAN YOU MONSTER?"


"I'm doing this for the sake of everyone in this town, you don't want to see it mad, trust me.
You will understand soon enough."


"You told me he died in an accident, not a murder,yo-YOU MURDERER!


"This creature, Can end everyone with a snap, he has lived in this town for centuries, It can devour everything in its path."


"No this isn't happening, it must be a nightmare." I mumble


"Its not, I thought that too in the beginning."


"In the beggining?? Also how do you know this creature has been here for centuries?"


"Centuries for me, not for you."


"W-what?"


"You made a mistake by coming back, you freed me from the loop, it's your turn now."


"Loop?"


"Good luck, also there is one important rule, do not, and I mean do not-"


His voice fades away, the reality around me fades away.


"The gym will close in 5 minutes, please pack your things. We would like to remind you that the opening hours are from 10am to 1am, thank you for your cooperation."


I check my clock, it's may 27th 12:55pm, 1 day before the incident. 


I run to a co worker


"Where is the boss?"


"Funny joke, are you being sarcastic or what?"


"No really where is he?"


"You must have banged your head really hard, boss."

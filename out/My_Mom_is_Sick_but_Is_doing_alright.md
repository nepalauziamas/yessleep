About 6 weeks ago my mom got very sick. My dad was scared and sad for a long time but I knew she would be fine. It started off as a Cold and we thought it was COVID. One by one my family members got it. 

But my mom was different. Her skin started to grey. She became sluggish. Her breathing slowed and she started to cough. 

My dad got very sad after it persisted beyond a week. 

She stopped moving around and my dad started ignoring her, we started doing chores around the house. 

My Sister moved out just before the pandemic and so she avoided the sickness all together. 

During the 2nd week she started to vomit, but it wasn't like stomach contents. It was water mixed with blood. She hadn't eaten for a few days and eventually stopped eating all together.

My Dad eventually stopped paying attention to her but me and her talked all day. She told me about our family members and her brother who died before I was born. Her father who was a cancer researcher and Her mother who always tucked her in and sang to her while she fell asleep. 

She started to worsen as her eyes became milky white, she stopped moving all together at the peak of the 2nd week and instead just talked with me. I learned so much about my family. My dad tried to tell me to stop talking but I'm certain he just fell out of love with her because she was sick. But I stayed even when her skin started to fall off. 

But I stayed with her. She kept telling me about my grand parents, my aunts, my uncles, secrets I never knew. Like how her brother worked on the railway when he died. He slipped and fell under the train one winter. 

In the 3rd week she got into more detail. He didn't die immediately and she was with him when he died. He was pinned for several minutes before his organs gave up. I learned so much. One of my Uncles was a convicted murderer and stabbed his best friend. My aunt was a lovely woman and lives a few miles away.  And my moms sister had died when she was 30 because of Cancer. Their dad had been treating her and tried to cure her but had no luck. He took his own life after the same thing happened to his wife.

Mom got kind of gross in the 4th week when her left eye fell out. It was almost liquid and I could see her rib cage. My sister came to visit and cried on my shoulder. She didn't say anything but My mom seemed mad that she came to visit. She hasn't told me why. 

In the 5th week Her skull and Chin became visible and she lost all her hair but she didn't smell bad. She still smelled of her favorite purfume. It was some french name that her mother used. My dad returned to work and he does security for a Hospital, I'm still caring for mom so I am still on my time off. Mom also started to tell me about her lovers through her life. My dad wasn't her first nor her last. She got into very explicit detail. I asked if I could touch her but she only let me do it once. She felt very sticky and had puss and fluid filling her underwear.

Its now week 6 and my dad hasn't been home all week. I make myself dinner and Lunch but mom doesn't eat. My sister called me and said a couple of guys from the hospital are coming to talk with Mom about her condition but I think she's over reacting. She looks a little gross but I know she'll come through. She hasn't stopped telling me stories. 

My favorite one is about how her brother didn't slip.

I (26F) recently moved into and fully renovated my first home with my husband(30M). My Grandmother gifted us some old, but very nice sturdy furniture that her and my grandfather had acquired over the years. One of the items was a pretty but plain writing desk that my grandfather used often in his study before he passed. 

Nothing was left in it besides some old pens and paper clips. Over a year or so I had filled it with a lot of office junk. I never used it for anything other than storage, it just sat in our guest room to fill up space. 

My husband complained about the desk being in his “man cave” and I agreed to move it into the bedroom closet. At this point I was pregnant with our first child and having extremely vivid dreams every night about random things. That night I dreamed I was someone else, a little girl with some siblings and a lot of friends. We all lived in a different time period, probably like the 50s-60s. In my dream I was aware that my “father” had died and my mother was dating a man next door. Everyone loved him, he was kind and gave us gifts. 

In my dream I became aware that one of my friends had gone missing, then another. Im not sure how much time passed but it seemed like this dream was going on over the course of years and I was acutely aware that more children were not going home at night. My “dream sister” whispered that she knew who was taking the kids as we were walking together. “Who is it?” She just kept giggling and using a weird sing-song voice. 

“You know he locks his desk.” I was getting irritated with her, and she wouldn’t answer each time I asked her who. “He forgot to lock it today.”
I told her to stop it and started walking again towards our house. In just a tiny whisper I hear “he took me too.” An awful feeling washed over my body like boiling water. She wasn’t there, she hadn’t been for months. My mother had been crying for her and my child brain just had the realization she had gone missing too. 

I ran to the house beside ours, almost like I knew what was going to happen; I crept to the desk I knew would be inside. I opened all the drawers, and under the velvet bottom, which was not actually the bottom, I found little white rocks…a hundred of them. 
I held them up wondering… teeth. Tiny little teeth. 

I told my husband about my dream as I always do. He listens as usual, waiting to be creeped out by whatever my weird brain came up with this time. I remember so many details, almost like a mini movie plot. 

I knew there wasn’t anything like that in the desk, I have known that desk, played in it, stuffed toys in it, stole pens and markers from it, all throughout my childhood. Even as a teenager I did my homework at it pretty often, and it has been in my new house for more than a year. But… I still went and searched every crevice, even tearing up the bottom velvet lining. To my relief (and small dismay) there wasn’t anything but the junk I stuffed in there.  

We eventually got around to moving the desk out of my husbands man cave, along with a bunch of other furniture. I swept up the floor before we started moving other stuff back in, and what do I see? 
A little white rock. I bend down and pick it up… there’s no way… 
Just one, very white, unmistakably…tiny tooth. I held it up to my husband, and we both just stared in disbelief.

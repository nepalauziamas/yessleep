July 3rd 1928 —

When Ernest Fowler relayed this to me, taken aback would be putting the thing very lightly. I’ve travelled up and down the East Coast and never, barring a particularly vicious snap frost combined with a very thoughtless driver, have I heard of an entire town’s crop of corn going bad right after it was picked. That was what was peculiar too, he said: at first, it was just the corn. The flowers didn’t wilt. The grass stayed firm and luscious. Only the corn withered and died.

Ernest Fowler made a killing that day at the market. Nobody else was able to sell an ear. It was all bad, the corn black and almost charred looking, as though it had been left in an oven all day. It would be an awful corn year for the farmers.

Fortunately, most of them had diversified their interests. Most farmers also keep livestock. In any case, It had been a prosperous few years and most of them had a little socked away for a rainy day.

They grumbled and complained and scratched their heads but few people were really ruined by this turn of events, although there were murmurs amongst the townsfolk that Jed Gordon might default on his bank loan. That was only the beginning though. Things were about to get a lot worse for the townsfolk of Samson.

The dogs were next. On a Thursday night, every dog in the town and in the surrounding neighbourhoods began to bark. This, in and of itself, was not a particularly strange event. After all, dogs bark. It’s what they do. No, what was perplexing was that the dogs *all* began to bark *at precisely the same time*. And they wouldn’t stop. Maggie Sheppard’s little scotch terrier was flipping out, yapping all over the place. Will Fotherington’s old coonhound appeared to be yodelling in that peculiar yelping howl that hounds have. It was the same all over town. Dogs of all shapes and sized, all creeds and colours, spotted and striped and black and white: all of them seemed hell bent on making a racket.

The owners tried to shut them up. They muzzled them, or put them in sheds. Some of the meaner ones even beat the poor creatures, but none of it would do a lick of good. The dogs continued to bark and howl and yelp and yap. This went on for days, until the cacophony merely soundtracked town life.

Then, one day, they disappeared. Every dog that could ran, exhibiting prodigious feats of strength and daring, chewing through ropes, leaping over fences. They all scarpered. The ones that couldn’t, those who were tied with metal chains up or locked in sheds continued to howl. But their mouths foamed with the strain of the constant exertion and inevitably they had to be put down as mad. The one’s that didn’t became flaccid, gibbering wreck’s lying on the floors of their master’s houses until it became at worst good sense and at best a charity to put them out of their misery.

According to Fowler, this did not exclusively affect the canine citizenry either. Horses too, became wary in the town. Often they would bolt, especially near to the centre of town where the fountain lay. They became skittish and wild and most folk chose to drive them around the outskirts of the town where they could. A stampede occurred at the market once, with Maisie Rogers’s strawberry stall getting knocked down, the strawberries all bouncing down the street like so many shiny, misshapen marbles. It was a bad time for the people of Samson. Bad and getting worse.

The cats disappeared without a trace on that first night tha the dogs went mad, though it took most of their owners a few days to notice this since they had been so preoccupied with the plight of man’s best friend. But mark this, not a saucer of milk was touched by a feline, not a scratching post scratched, not a mouse was ever chased in that town until this day of recounting. It was as though, Fowler told me, the town had become a cursed place, a shunned place and the animals knew it.

Slowly, the rest of the plant life began to die off. Now it was whole trees. Summer fruit rotten on the vine and on the trees, their branches bending down low, far too low in an uncanny gumminess. The branches felt spongy and lifeless to the touch and the bark of the trees began to turn an ugly, ashy grey-green. Mould spores began to grow on them, almost the second the sun wasn’t directly pointed at them them and people would cough as they walked by.

Some people, the observant ones anyway, began to notice that the ground around the town monument to Clive Samson, the beefy founder of the town who had established it back 1855, was becoming cracked and bunched. Had there been a low-level earthquake? Surely not. The big wigs in Indianapolis would have felt it with their fancy seismograph machines.

Just last week though, it had been fine, Millie Hoggart would have sworn it, for she dusted it weekly, the statue being so close to her own little apartment. Something about those cracks gave her the heeby-jeebies. She said it reminded her of a snake, shedding its skin, all those little scales bunching up around the bottom of the statue of Clive Samson.

And the wind. A nasty, unruly wind seemed to blow down through the town, through the statue of Clive Samson specifically and it made a sort of mournful, lowing sound. It was a bitterly cold wind, especially this close to Summer and it went right through the town, a sort of hollow whistling that nobody could remember from before. Jed Gordon (he of the overdrawn bank loan) was heard to tell people that it had come down from across Lake Michigan but, nobody had ever heard of an icy wind blowing this far across from the lake this late in Spring.

Eyes turned across, to look at Ernest Fowler’s house and dark mutterings stirred about that damn sunflower.

Word spreads like forest fires in a small town and everyone had heard about Fred the sunflower. It grew and grew. Fred was by now more than two thirds the size of Fowler’s house, and it didn’t cling to the sides of the clapboard like a vine either. The stem of the sunflower was a sinewy mass, with a girth matching that of a stop sign pole. Its great reticulated face followed not the path of the sun, as its smaller brethren did but stayed locked fixedly facing towards the town. Many a farmer scowled as they drove past that towering helianthae\*\*.\*\*

“I’m gonna chop that thing down one of these days, mark me that,” Devlin Reynolds said to his wife as they drove past in their Studebaker one day. “I don’t like it. It’s not natural for a flower get that big. Nope, I don’t like it at all. It's bad luck if it's anything.” She put her hand on his knee and said nothing.

For Fowler though, his luck was in direct opposition to the diminishing fortunes of the town, and things seemed to get better and better. It seemed as though good fortune rolled in from all sides, crashing in torrents against his life, as though he were a lighthouse beset on all sides by a storm of good and better.

His corn crop was a bumper — the best he’d ever seen in his lifetime and likely his daddy’s — and he’d made a mint from it. His car, a rickety and broken down T-bird sat plunked in the garage... until the day a man from the city came knocking on the door, telling him that it was a one of a kind genuine first edition; one of the first to ever roll off Henry Ford’s lot. He paid Fowler a sum five times that which Fowler himself had paid for the car a few years ago. Ernest Fowler went out and got himself a shiny new Lincoln Continental the next day.

Meanwhile, the sickness that seemed to have befallen the trees now turned to the rest of the animals. The horses, already skittish, now either ran from their stables or dropped into a phelgmy sickness. Their bodies turned a nasty shade of grey-green. Their bones became gelatinous and unholy to the touch. Rabbits in the fields displayed a strange and distinct wave to the way they loped, as if they were made of jelly. Soon, they began to turn up in the fields, either dead or breathing so shallow as to be sure to go that way soon. Their bodies, like the horses, did not feel right and once found nobody thought to eat them.

It was really the cows that sent the town from grim unrest to unrestrained panic. Their milk had long since turned sour and sickish, totally undrinkable by human standards. And, as established, there weren't a lot of cats and dogs to pick up the slack. Johnny Wiessman was out in the field one day, tending to the corn plants, trying to salvage something from the drooping rubbery stalks when he saw a cow out in the field. Her name was Melcy and she was a particular favourite of his. She didn't give do so well on the milk front anymore, and worse recently, but she was a good old cow, always patient with children and friendly. She seemed to be standing out in the field, staring in that winsome, vacant way that cows do.

Except that, upon closer inspection, her gaze wasn't quite the starily vacant bovine gaze he was expecting. Her eyes seemed to be locked on something off in the far distance and her gaze spoke of extreme anxiety, terror even. More to the point, she was frozen quite stiff. Johnny called out to her to see if she was alright. Melcy let out a small choked lowing sound and appeared to try to turn to her master, though her flesh was stiff and she could not seem to angle it very far.

What happened next was only seen by Johnny and  many are skeptical of the veracity of his statement. But Fowler told me Johnny Weissman had never told a lie in his life, and if he had, well, he had confessed it in church the very next day. Besides, it tracks with what occurred to the rest of the domestic animals thereafter, even though nobody else actually saw it.

Johnny says Melcy was there one second, frozen and lowing in panic but extant. Then there was a jerk and she seemed to sink into the earth, maybe six inches. Quickly though, "like as if she was pulled by some great and powerful force," were his words. The next second, there was a sucking sound and Melcy had completely disappeared into the field. Johnny ran right up to the spot where she had been but all he saw — for just a second, mind — was  a hole filled with what appeared to be ... tentacles. Maybe vines, it was hard to say. Johnny says it was like a snake pit, all of them writhing and wriggling all over each other with that awful grey-green colour that the trees had turned. And underneath it, was Melcy eyes wild, peering back up at her master in an awful prayer. Then it was gone, the hole and all, just like that. Just freshly packed earth. Johnny Weissman ran back to the house as fast as his young legs would carry him and didn't come out for a full twenty-four hours.

Within a day, all the livestock had disappeared. Pigs, cows, sheep. Even Elmer Hazel's little goats that he kept — darn fool of him because everyone knew that goats were a menace and the milk was no good even before the strangeness — seemed to disappeared. When Johnny came forward with his story people reacted badly. Half of them didn't want to hear it, half of them wanted to pack up and leave town right there. Fights broke out on the street and the police department had to come by and calm everyone down.

On Ernest Fowler's side however, the good fortune was still ramping up. His own livestock had grown fat an hale, and his ewes had even given birth children. Things were looking up and up at the Fowler residence, although he couldn't help but feeling sorry for his fellow farmers. He helped out where he could, delivering round excess crops and supplies to the families that need it. For the most part though, the only thanks he received was a curt nod and an eye of suspicion.

A couple weeks after the livestock had gone, he received a letter in the mail.

At this point, the good Mr. Fowler took out the letter and showed it to me right there. It had a strange, red wax seal on the front and looked very officious and imperious.

“Austrian!” he told me, brimming with pride. “Apparently, I’m related to a baron. I mean, he wasn’t the king of Austria or anything like that, but he must have had some money. There was some sort of terrible fire and everyone familiarly related perished. No heirs, would you believe it? Turns out they followed the genealogy down to the next in line and it was me! Funny how these things turn out?”

So the clapboard shack became a country manor. A shiny new tractor was purchased to order. Fowler even hired some help. Not from town though. Few of the townsfolk would come anywhere near his place anymore.

In town, an emergency meeting was called. All significant personages of the town of Samson were required to meet there. Fowler, was now just such a person of significance, even if he was a lifelong bachelor, which already made folk suspicious. Still, money talks and bull, if you’ll pardon the expression, walks. Fowler put on his very best suit, a powder blue number with a red bow tie. As he walked into the town hall, he felt more than one pair of eyes bead on him, and not in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way either.

The meeting itself might as well have been a bloodsport. Threats were made. Tempers and voices rose and frayed. More than one pointed accusation was made. In the end it all came to the same.

“There’s obviously some kinda curse that’s been put on us,” Will Fotherington said, “It was that old crone who came by here selling sunflowers. You all remember!”

The townsfolk murmured in discontented agreement. They did remember the sunflower lady with the strange, tiny blooms that weren’t right for the time of year. Hadn’t Millie Hoggart swung at her? Could that have set her off? More arguing, more infighting. Ernest Fowler, not man who favoured pugilism, looked at his shoes.

Finally, Devlin Reynolds stood up and cleared his throat. Now, Devlin Reynolds held some status in the little town of Samson. He was a thin reedy man with a thin reedy little moustache and movie star good looks. He was on the town council and held a good bit of property within the town itself, including the bank and a controlling stake in the small town paper ‘The Samson Crier’. Those who were a little more cynically inclined, might have said that he was the hand that pulled the strings of Samson’s puppet major, a little red-faced man, lousy with drink and high-times.

Devlin had “connections” back in Chicago and that’s all anybody would really say of the thing. You didn’t mess with a man who had those sort of connections.

“Have any of you gone by Mr. Fowler’s house recently?” Devlin Reynolds spoke softly, but with a lilt of danger, like a very sharp blade cutting through grass. Many in the crowd grunted their assent. They all knew the thing that rose up next to Ernest Fowler’s house. “He has himself a pretty little sunflower. Fred, I think he calls it. Well, I shouldn’t say little. It’s a bigg’un. I’d say, oh… ten feet high? That about right, Mr. Fowler?”

Fowler sunk further into his seat.

“Now,” Devlin Reynolds went on with the smooth, dangerous style of a big city Chicago lawyer, which it was know to some that he had once been been, “I don’t want to make false conjectures here, but is it or is it not true that Mr. Fowler was seen giving that particular woman a ride out of town?”

“It’s true! It's true, I saw it with my own eyes!” Millie Hoggart said, evidently trying to distract from her own indiscretions.

Now tongues were flapping, and the suspicious slant to the eyes of the townsfolk that had first greeted Fowler as he walked in, deepened to anger. The townsfolk's voices were suddenly replete with low, murderous mutterings.

“It’s him!” Jed Gordon yelled out, “He’s the one whose sent our fortune to a low turn!”

“Now, just a minute,” Doc Abernathy stood up and put his hands protectively out in front of Fowler, who he was sitting next to. “Say he does have a flower in his yard the size of a juvenile sequoia? Say even that he did give that woman a ride. We can’t blame him for the troubles that have befallen us. It’s indecent! I don’t see a lick of proof in it.”

But the townsfolk were no longer paying attention to any call to reason. They had blood in their eyes and as anyone who has seen a mob first hand knows, there’s very little one can do in calming them down when you’re right in its crosshairs. They began to advance on Ernest Fowler.

Phew, this story is turning out longer than I intended dear diary. Between you and me and the watering can out the back, I didn’t realise I had such a yarn in me. More tomorrow, I suppose.

Tyler and I waited a long time for Mr. Egan to come back out to that door. When he finally got back out the door, he put his hood back and headed back down the hallway and through the other door. When we finally saw that Egan was gone, that’s when we decided to see what he was up to. Walking through that door was the most nerve-racking thing I had ever done. Luckily, my phone was just sitting there on the floor, exactly where I had dropped it. 

Once I had picked up my phone though, I was more distracted by something else. The stench in the room was excruciating. I had smelled something so bad in my life. Tyler was the one who pointed out to me the puddles of blood on the floor, and even more, blood was splattered on the walls. It looked like something or someone had been killed recently. Me and Tyler had bolted it out of that room and back down the hallway as quickly as we could. Hears pounding, covered in sweat by the time we had gotten out of the school. 

“Wait a minute,” I said as we were heading back to Tyler’s house. “What happened to Joey?”

“What do you mean?” Tyler asked, realizing the third man in the operation had gone missing.

“Well, I didn't see him when we left the fourth floor, or since we went into the hallway to be completely honest,” I said, pulling out my cell phone. “I’m gonna try calling him. He might’ve gotten scared when he saw Egan coming and ran back home or something.”

“I knew we shouldn’t have brought him. Thankfully he didn’t blow our cover.” Tyler said as I dialed Joey’s number.

“No answer, I said after calling Joey’s number three times. “We’ll wait till school tomorrow and if we don’t hear from him by then, we’re gonna have to go back up there and investigate.”

We reached Tyler’s house and departed as I started back for my house, so many thoughts swirling through my mind? What happened to Joey and is he okay? Why was Mr. Egan sneaking up to the fourth floor? And what the hell was the deal with all that blood? I finally got home and my head was still in a tailspin. I decided I was gonna ask my mom if she knew anything, about the fourth floor, about Mr. Egan, after all, she did go to school with him at the same time, maybe she would know something. Because now one of my best friends was missing and that was not something that sat well with me.

“Hey, ma,” I said as we sat down for dinner. It was only the two of us as we lived alone in a one-bedroom apartment.

“What?” She scoffed as she took a bite of her food.

“I have a question for you. A school question.” I replied.

“I’m not signing any more school notes for you, if you get expelled for skipping class again, that’s on you.” She rolled her eyes at me, a look of disappointment that I recognized all too well. 

“No, it’s not like that at all. I wanna know what you know about the fourth floor. And what do you know about the connection between that and Mr. Egan?” I asked as I watched the look on her face go from anger and disappointment to shock. 

“What do you mean about the pool?” She asked. “It doesn’t exist. It’s just a stupid rumor. And I don’t know what Mr. Egan has to do with anything but as I said, everything you’ve heard is bogus rumors. Have you gotten your grades up yet?” She asked, very obviously changing the subject.

I decided to drop the subject and not tell her about what I had seen because I knew she just wouldn’t believe me anyway. “They’re still just as bad as normal.” I replied, finishing my food in silence.

I went to my room that night after dinner and decided that I wasn’t done with research yet. A couple of hours later and a deep dive into google had found me an article written by a student a few years ago by the name Jasper Flynn claiming that he had been a student at Lynn Classical and graduated back in 2002, and that he knew of the monster on the fourth floor and that he had been trying to tell people but no one would listen to his. Thankfully, he had left his email at the bottom of the article, so I decided to send him a message and see if he would get back to me.

Hi Jasper, 

I am currently a student at LCHS and I saw the monster and I was wondering if you knew anything about it. I would love to hear about your experiences and I would be glad to tell you mine. 

Thanks!

I left my name and my email at the bottom of the message and went to take a shower and get ready for bed. When I got back twenty minutes later there was an email from Jasper. He wanted to meet after school on Friday at the Old Mill Sub Shop. I told him that I would see him Friday afternoon at three (as long as I could avoid detention) and I would tell him everything I knew then. 

I had just settled into bed, my head still full now with more questions than ever as I got a ping on my phone. I looked down to see who it was and saw that it was Tyler. I decided to ignore the text as I could just read it in the morning. As I closed my eyes I got three more texts from three different classmates. I decided to look at Tyler’s text only to regret everything almost immediately. I looked down at the text and the words that were on my phone were “Dude. Joey’s dead.” My heart sank immediately.

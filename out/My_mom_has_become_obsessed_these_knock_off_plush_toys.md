Hey everyone. 

Mallory here, trying to figure out a few things about a weird ass toy my mom has become obsessed with. She says they were an off brand of the Beanie Babies or something. 
No this isn’t a prank. This has gotten out of my control. 

Like literally I haven’t had a good night's rest and things have gone from bad to worse for the past few days because of this nostalgia trip she has been on and I figured what the hell; maybe someone on here knows what I’m looking for. This may be my last chance at saving her….


Actually let me start at the beginning. 

Ok, this is probably showing her age but she says the 90s was an amazing time to be a kid. 

Disney Afternoon Cartoons, the Simpsons, Blockbuster Video… there wasn’t much that you could complain about when it came to entertainment according to her. I try my best to not roll my eyes when she gets on this binge rant. I can cite what she says verbatim though. 

“I didn’t have any of those luxuries… your nan wasn’t exactly a saint.”

This is the part of the story I hate to tell others about, but I figure 100% honesty here will help. 

Her mom was less than stellar, in fact grandma was a drug addict and could hardly keep them fed or housed. 

“Don’t get me wrong, mom loved us in her own way. She would get us clothes at yard sales, hand me downs from relatives and buy knock off products that she felt were just as good as the original,” mom insists.  

“We couldn’t get LEGO, So we got Kre-o. Couldn’t afford Barbie so we got Polly Pocket. That sort of thing.”

She says this while in between cigarettes as if she has conquered her own addictions. 

Last birthday, I went to this second hand store and bought her a stuffed walrus, her favorite animal.
It reminded me a little of the old school plushies except clearly it was made of cheaper material. It was missing a tusk as if it hadn’t been finished and looked like it was supposed to be a pirate. But I figured with her love for knickknacks and knock offs, this would be the perfect gift. 

When she saw it, she cried and that surprised me because my mom never does that. 

“Something wrong? Did I mess up?” I asked her. 

“No… it’s just… I thought… never mind…” 

I didn’t know what to make of her little outburst but I shrugged it off. Mom has never been too open about her childhood and I figured that was just a door she wasn’t ready to open just yet. 

I let it slide but later that night I heard her… singing? I had gotten up to pee and she was just rocking there in the living room like some zombie from a bad B-film. Rocking and holding the little stuffed animal. 

“Don’t worry Waffles… I won’t let them keep us from each other this time,” she cooed to it. Treating it like an infant. She had never shown me that level of affection. 

I thought about confronting her about it. But honestly I was too weirded out by it so instead I tried to do a google search when I got back to bed. 

As you might have guessed, Waffles the Walrus pulled up zero results, except for a few culinary creations. But nothing about a stuffed toy. 

Once again, I decided that it must just be something from her childhood she hadn’t explained to me yet. I knew some stuff wasn’t on the internet so this was probably just some random thing that didn’t have a big enough following. 

A few days past and I decided to toss the stuffed animal into the washing machine, get it all cleaned up. Well, that was a mistake. Mom went ballistic. 

I didn’t actually know until I got back from running errands that day. 

She was tossing furniture, tearing up carpet with a box cutter and acting like a mad woman when I got home. 

“What the hell??” I shrieked as I saw the wanton destruction. “Where is he?? What did you do with Waffles?” she screamed back. Her eyes were filled with panic like she had lost a puppy. Or even an actual child. 

At first I was so flabbergasted and confused that I didn’t know how to process this. This was insanity. 

“What has gotten into you?? It’s just a stuffed animal!” I shouted as I pulled it from the dryer. 

To my shock, she grabbed the toy and then she slapped me against my right cheek. 

“It’s more than that! Waffles is my Fluffy Friend! Don’t you dare ever touch him again!”

It took every ounce of patience I had not to hit her back. I have had her stay with me because I know she has issues, and that was the only reason I let it slide. 

Whatever her connection was to this plushie, it was triggering a lot of trauma and making her lash out. As a result, I was the target. 

That was my first rational explanation anyway. 

“So has she lost her mind?” My close friend Hanna asked when I told her what happened that night. 

“I don’t really know. I keep telling myself that I moved in because she was unstable already after what happened with dad but this was a lot more than I ever meant to sign up for,” I admitted. 

“Maybe you should talk to her dad. He’s still alive right?” Hanna asked. 

That thought terrified me. If grandma was a sorry druggie, then Grandpa was the unapologetic kingpin. The reason for her addiction. Before mom started to become unhinged she said that he used to beat her. And I vaguely remember he did the same to me when I was little. 

Not the type of person you want to ask for help. 

Memories that I suppressed reared their head that night as I contemplated asking about the toy. 

There was this time in my childhood we were taken fishing with grandpa. I didn’t know then how cruel he could be. I was too young to swim, and when I sheepishly became scared of getting on the boat…

His strong arms grabbed me and I felt my breath leave my chest. I was up in the air and flying toward the water. His voice was ringing in the air, laughing as he told me that I had to sink or swim.

And then I was falling into darkness, his laughter all I heard. In the shadows I heard a bellowing sound. 

A giant looming figure was swimming toward me, larger than any known sea creature. It’s eyes black as night and skin pale as the moon. Those tusks, gleaming in the water as it thundered toward me… 


I shook back and forth all night, getting up twice to vomit as I realized that I simply had to resolve this. Especially since it seemed with each passing day mom was becoming more detached from reality and focused on this toy.

So even though I was dreading it, I called grandpa up that next day and arranged to meet at a public place. He can’t hurt me here, I told myself. 

I had a squeeze ball in my hand as I waited at a Starbucks. He came with his newest slut, some forty something that likely only cared for his money. 

“Wasn’t expecting this to be a real call, Mal. What did you want?” he snarled. 

“Nice to see you too. Look… it’s about Diana… something is wrong with her.” I began. 

“What else is new?” he scoffed. 

“What I’m trying to say.. is that I am really worried about her and I think some childhood trauma is messing with her head.” 

“Talk to her mother about that one,” he muttered. 
“You know I can’t do that. I’m not here to blame you. I’m here for help,” I told him. 

“She stopped wanting my help a long time ago,” he answered. 

“I said that I need it, and if not for her then please give me some sanity back. You know I’m bending over backwards to try and keep us afloat,” I said with a weariness in my voice. This conversation was going nowhere fast. 

When it seemed that he was ready to shut down I showed him a picture of mom holding the stuffed walrus and to my surprise, he actually froze. There was a look of fear on his face I had never seen before. 

Then his eyes got wide and he snatched the picture. 

“Where did you get this? No. It’s not possible… it can’t be,” he muttered. 

“So then you recognize it? She called it a Fluffy friend,” I explained. This time his wild eyes focused on me. 

“I’m telling you this can’t be possible. I hurled that thing in the fireplace when she was nine,” he told me. 

“What? You burned her favorite children's toy?” I was so taken aback by the admission after I said that I was actually at a loss for words. 

“Damn right I did. Something was off about that thing,” he told me. 

I gave him a curious look but he was too scared to even keep talking about it. 

“There is no way that’s the same toy though. Where did you get it?” he asked. I shrugged. “Some secondhand shop near the downtown square. I knew she loved old 90s toys so I figured it would be a hit,” I said. 

“Listen to me, Mal. You need to destroy that thing. Destroy it before it destroys you,” he warned as he grabbed his girl and left. 

 The whole experience left me with more questions than answers. At the very least I confirmed that the product itself did once exist but I guessed it had not made much money to make a name for itself. 

But the rest of his nonsense about the plushie being dangerous made him sound just as unhinged as his daughter. 

When I got home, mom acted suspicious of me. 

“Where did you go? What were you doing?” she asked. It had me on defense almost immediately. 

“Just had lunch with a friend.”  I saw she was still clutching the stuffed animal as usual. She held it up to her ear as if she was listening to it. 

“Waffles says you're lying. He says you talked to someone. Someone who wants to separate us again,” she muttered. 

I was at a loss for words about that, having no clue whether she really knew where I had gone or was just making an assumption. I decided to try to reason with her. 

But that was a mistake. 

“It’s just… not normal the time you have been spending with Waffles. That’s all,” I said. 

“You stay away from us, I made a promise. A long time ago. I told Waffles that I will never leave. And I never break my promises.” 

I let out a long sigh, not even bothering to contradict that. Then I saw she was holding something in her right palm. It was a kitchen knife. 

Immediately my frustration switched to panic. 
Was she seriously considering hurting me just to protect this stuffed animal? 

“Mom… you need to put that away,” I told her as I kept my distance. 

“I… I don’t think that I can,” she said as her lip trembled. It was a mixture of desperation and fear. She was clearly beyond help and I was about to be her victim.  

She raised the knife and lunged for me.

The only thing that kept her from finishing the attack was a kitchen chair. I pushed her back and she slammed her head on the table, screaming in pain as she dropped both the knife and the toy. 

I scooped them up, and yelled at her. “This has gone too damn far. I can’t do this anymore mom. I’m sorry. I’m going to put you back in that center,” I decided. 

“No!! No you can’t do that!” she begged as she pushed herself up off the floor. 
For a moment I thought she might regain sanity and see just how much damage she had done. 

Instead she was still reaching for the stuffed toy, clearly the only thing she even cared about at this point. 

“This was a mistake ever thinking you could change,” I told her as I went to my room and locked the door. She was already violent, I didn’t even feel safe in my own house. 

I called the psychiatric center without delay, looking down at the stuffed toy and trying to figure out just what exactly made it so important to my mom. 

Maybe it was my tired brain from all this fighting, but when I did look at the walrus… it seemed… I guess the word I’m looking for is I couldn’t quite remember what it looked like when I first bought it. 

Was the missing tusk on the right or left? And how had I overlooked a tag? 

It was shaped like a spade and shaded purple with the logo around the edges. My Fluffy Friendz. And on the inside was a little poem that was supposed to tell you what the animal was all about. 

As I read it I couldn’t help but to feel a lump in my throat. It felt off somehow in a way that I couldn’t quite put my finger on. 


*Waffles the Walrus is sad and alone*

*all day long people hear him cry and moan*

*Waffles was hurt, can you feel it too?*

*Why not take him home with you?*

Then below that was a simple date which I guessed was supposed to be the animal's birthday, November 24th and the letters KGC. 

My uneasy feeling was now growing. November 24th was the day my grandmother died of heart failure. 

Surely it was a coincidence this stuffed animal shared that date? 
A rattling noise shook me from my speculation, mom slamming her fist against the door. 

“Mallory, you need to open up. I am your mother and you need to let me in there!” she shrieked. 

I focused on the phone call and asked how soon she could be given a room again. Thankfully I was told given her precipitous mental health that emergency lodging would be provided for a reduced cost. 

At the same time as I confirmed that they were on their way to pick her up, she was softly tapping the door now. 

“Mal… please. I’m sorry. I am sorry about all of this…” 

She sounded like her old self again. Sane and grounded. 

I turned to the door, cautious to not open it. 

“They are already on their way here,” I announced. 

“Sweetie… I’m sorry. Please don’t send me there. I know we haven’t seen eye to eye, and I know I haven’t been myself lately. I just don’t know what’s come over me…” 

It astonished me to hear her sound so calm and collected. It made me regret actually making the call. 

“Please just open the door. Let’s try to make things work. It’s what your father would want us to do,” she whispered. 

That lump in my throat came back as tears filled my eyes. It’s been three years and this is the first time she has even admitted that he isn’t here anymore. 

I unlocked the door and opened it to see that the hallway was empty. 

“Mom…?” 



Suddenly the bathroom door across the hall sprung open and she was rushing toward me, her eyes as black as night. She grabbed me and tackled me to the floor, shrieking like a bat out of hell. 

I pressed my fingers into her mouth to try and force her to gag as she clawed and fought for the stuffed plush, snarling over and over again. She even went so far as to bite and draw blood. 

“We have to be whole!! He can’t be whole without me!!!” 



In desperation I reached for one of the glass vases on the table and slammed it against her face. She immediately crumpled unconscious to the floor as I gasped for breath. 

The full extent of what had just happened began to sink in. My mother was barely clinging to life with blood soaking into the carpet, shards of glass all around her and evidence of a battle that ranged the entire house. 

All as a result of this damned plushie, I thought as I reached down and picked it up out of the stain. Drops of blood would ruin it, I thought.

Part of me wanted to just destroy it right then and there after all the trouble it had caused me. 

But I went ahead and washed it along with my own soaked clothes, catching my breath as I struggled to regain some sense of normalcy. 


It was late when they arrived and took mom to the psych center, and she was just barely coherent. As you might have guessed her only request was to take the stuffed walrus. 

One of the employees that was helping her into the transport asked about it so I led her inside and showed the stuffed doll. It was wet still and it looked like some of the blood had stained on its tusk permanently. It gave off a weird vibe to me now seeing it there. 

“That kinda reminds me of something that my dad used to have when he was a kid. Fluffy Friend or something?” she asked. 

My eyes lit up with excitement. “That’s actually exactly what they are called! You have no idea how glad I am to hear that they actually exist. I was starting to think it was all just a figment of my mom’s fractured mind,” I admitted. 

The woman crossed her arms uncomfortably and asked, “Why does this toy matter to your mom so much?”

“I don’t know. I tried to look up some info about it online but there is literally nothing,” I admitted with a shrug. “It was probably just an old memory of a happier time. Did your dad ever tell you anything about it?” 

“He died a few years back. Not long after he collected some of these toys as a matter of fact. Talk about weird, Right?” she said. 

“Yeah,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck and suddenly not even feeling comfortable around the toy myself. 

“I will look into the center’s policies to see if they let your mom have it. I know these things meant an awful lot to my dad, so it’s the least that I can do,” she said. 

I walked her out and watched as the transport left, clutching the stuffed walrus and feeling empty inside. 

Grandpa’s warning was ringing in my head. 

*Destroy it before it destroys you.* 

What if there was something wrong with this thing? Something unnatural? 

That night, I hardly slept again. And every time I woke up in a cold sweat I was desperately trying to remember the nightmares and yet my mind kept filling up with holes. The strange moans that had filled my head wouldn’t shut up. 

I kept looking toward my cabinet dresser where the stuffed walrus was slouched over on one side. Why did I have this uneasy feeling it was watching me? 

Why did I keep thinking that every time I woke it had moved a little closer?

When the cold sweats woke me for the third time I had enough and stuffed the toy away in my closet. Call me crazy but I locked the door and took sleeping pills. 


The next morning the nurse called and said that outside items of any kind were prohibited and honestly that was a bit of a relief. Maybe if my mom was away from the toy, it would make things easier for her, I thought. 

“My suggestion is that you should get rid of it. If what you are telling me is true, it’s caused more problems than it’s worth,” the therapist on call told me. 


I think hearing someone else voice those concerns was all it took for me to finally decide that I didn’t want this plushie to be consuming my every waking moment the way it did my mom. 

So I went to the closet and was about to throw the goddamned thing away only to discover… that it had grown another tusk

I slowly reached into the cabinet and touched the new tusk, realizing this one was sharp and felt like it was made out of some type of hardy material. 
If I didn’t know any better I would say it was bone. 

An hour later after I had scoured the house trying to find it, I got a call from the center. Mom had made an attempt on her life. 

I dropped everything and went, discovering that somehow she had managed to pry open the bolted windows and try to jump from the third floor. Broke her pelvis and two ribs. And apparently had also tried to snap her finger in half…?

She looked like shit. Like the shell of the woman that had raised me. 

When I stepped inside she was digging at the scab on her finger. She had managed to scratch it all the way to the bone. It looked infected, like a festering sore that would cover her whole body soon. 

Something about the missing finger bothered me but I couldn’t find piece it together just yet. 

“Mal…? Is that you?” she whispered as I entered her room. I had brought flowers, Begonias. 

“Hey ma,” I said with a half smile. I was beginning to realize that I didn’t have a clue if she would ever be better. 

“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to worry you. I know you have been… always here for me.” She looked like she was about to be in tears again and this moment of clarity shocked me. Was she really normal again or just pretending? 

“It’s okay mom… I’m not going anywhere.” 

“It’s too late for me, Mal. But it’s not for you. I want you to live a life free.” 

I put the begonias down and she instinctively grabbed the edge of my tank top at the bottom. 

“Promise me that you will do that? Promise me that you can be better?” she asked. 

My whole soul was overwhelmed with emotions. I wanted to embrace her. 

“You’ll be okay… I will be okay.”

I thought about the toy, wondering if I should even mention it as I saw all of the harm she had done to herself. Her ring finger was almost entirely gone… the last connection she had to dad. 

I realized that the bone was just large enough to be the same size as the newly formed tusk I had seen on the plushie at home. 

“Mom… why did you do that?” I whispered. 

Suddenly her attitude changed from night to day. 

“I have to make him whole again…” 

That dead look she gave me was replaced with something else entirely.

An unsettling look of desire that shook me to my very core. 

 “He will be whole again. He has to be….” She whispered as she started to shake back and forth. Her mind had slipped. Possibly gone forever. 

I left as she continued to rant and repeatedly mumble something under her breath. It didn’t even sound like a language. Just babbling. 

And I drove home, determined to find the plush and tear it to pieces. 

I ran to the cabinet, tears in my eyes as I kept hearing that bellowing noise ring all throughout the house. 

Except that the toy was now missing. 

In its place was the mangled skin and tissue of a finger…. A finger that had somehow dropped blood on my cabinet top to spell a terrifying message. 

MAKE US WHOLE AGAIN. 

This is where I make my plea… 
My mom is going to keep trying to hurt herself or others unless… unless I find this damned thing again and do what it asks and I only have 72 hours to do it. 

So I’m kinda putting together a search party here, making a forum to try and talk to others who can help me connect the dots about the toys and how I can find more of them. If not for my mom then maybe out of morbid curiosity? Maybe to discover what powers this thing has? 

I mean, it’s not like they just vanished off the face of the earth forever right. There’s a story here, something weird happened…something sinister is happening…  Maybe together we can figure that out?

I just… I guess I have this really bad feeling that if we don’t… 

Something much worse could happen to her. Or to me. 
Or to you. 

Call it my gut, but I think you guys have to help me. 

Help me before this thing hurts more people.

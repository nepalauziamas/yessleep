It was around 5 in the morning when my phone rang. I picked up the phone only to hear that voice I knew for quite some time. I was to report to the nearest military base. I packed a few of my things in my backpack and drove off to the base.

When I arrived at the military base the soldiers guarding the base led me to the office. They were heavily armed. There I saw General Henry sitting in his chair smoking a cigar. We know each other for a long time.

 He had his hands on his knees and was puffing away at his cigar.  He looked at me with that old look of his that I'd seen many times before. " I said " what's going on general? " he didn't respond for a long while but continued to smoke his cigar. He had his eyes closed and I could see the flames dancing on the end of his cigar. " you have been chosen to come here for something important... " he said.

 He told me my country needed me. And I was to go to Guam. And there I will be told everything I needed to know. He looked serious and I knew not to disobey him.
I was then transported by plane to Guam. After we arrived in Guam we were in some headquarters. There I was met by Admiral Lee. He led me to what looked like a conference room with other people sitting inside. I went in and sat down.

He then informed us why we were there. The US navy was getting some strange readings in the Mariana trench. And it was our mission to go down there and find out what could be giving them those strange readings.

A person from the crowd said why would they send people down there when robots and machines could be used?

The Admiral responded that's because machines and robots are costly and are hard to recover if something bad happens.

I asked why would something bad happen to them, and if the mission is safe?

He just laughed and told me to not ask stupid questions, and continued to speak. You are going to use a submarine that was upgraded so it can go down the trench without any problems the Admiral said.
He told us the mission will not be over until we find what was giving those strange readings.

After he finished informing us about the mission. He told us to get a good night's rest because we are going to the mission tomorrow morning. He then left the room.

We went to our barracks to rest for the night. On our way there I heard somebody calling for me it was Peter my best friend from high school. I ran over to Peter and said, "I am glad to see you, Peter. 

Both of us served in the Navy. I quit but he continued to serve the navy.

I guess we are working together on this mission, just like old times Peter said happily.

He hugged me and told me, "I'm glad you came, I missed you.

 I told him, "I miss you too, we're going to get this thing over with in a week.

We continued to talk some more for a few minutes before going to our rooms to sleep.
In the morning we were woken up and led to a harbor where the submarine was.

There I met my crew. There were 20 of us in total. The crew was made up of two cooks, a doctor, and one scientist and the rest were regular crewmen. The submarine was pretty small compared to other submarines, I was on.

The crew was dressed in white uniforms and the doctor was wearing a green lab coat and dark blue jeans.

After we packed all the needed equipment and food supplies we set off.

It was strange getting used to life on a submarine again but I managed. I used the time to get to know my crew better. The scientist named Antoni was a nice fellow a bit introverted but really smart. The scientist was also a little on the nerdy side, but I think he's pretty cool.

The two cooks are named Tom and Hank. They are good fellows but they do seem to not like each other much. The doctor is named Jake. Jake is cool and he always talks about how awesome the whole mission is.

 And I'm happy to say I got a pretty good crew. I usually spend most of my days talking to Peter and navigating our way to the Mariana trench.

When you spend a lot of time in the submarine your perception of time changes. We only knew what day it was by the meal our cooks prepared.
After a few days, we reached the location of the Marina trench. We then started our descent down.

We saw a giant octopus at around 450FT. At 490 FT we reached the dark zone here only 1% of the light from the surface reaches us and it was dark luckily we had lights and radar to help us navigate. 

At 1600FT I was surprised to see a whale they usually don't go down this much but this one did. At 2866 FT we were in complete darkness sunlight doesn't reach down here. Antoni was interested in all the creatures we encountered. At 19,700FT we have officially entered the Marina trench.

Everyone was excited when we entered the trench. On the submarine, we have a system you work for six hours, have six hours of free time, and six hours for sleep. And it was my turn to go to sleep while Peter was going to take my place. The only thing I remember was having a nice pleasant nap.

I was woken up by the screams of the crew. The sub was in complete darkness I rushed to the engine room. When I entered I immediately started the backup systems for power. I asked Peter what happened while I was asleep. He told me that everything was going okay until he heard a bizarre shriek and the power went out. I had no idea what the hell was going on and it made me worried.

 I was debating on going to the surface so we can fix the power problem but I decided to keep going. So I began going over the blueprints of the engine room and the electrical systems. It was a mess and it took me a while but I figured that all I had to do was find a way to turn on the main electrical system and run the power for the engine.

The mood on the submarine had changed completely. Everyone was disturbed by what happend. So I decided to have the crew play some board games so we could lighten up the mood. It had some success until our two cooks decided to settle their problem over who was cheating in the game of chess with fists.

We managed to separate them, and the crew stopped playing board games but at least it got people to not think about the power problem.

" This is the fourth time in two weeks that we've seen them do that. " I said.

They always argue. " you can't make a difference said, Peter.

Now while we descend further below Peter and I listen closely if we can hear the shriek again. It's pretty scary to think of what could have made that shriek. We are just a bunch of people trapped in a metal box, which is the only thing protecting us from the ocean and the creatures that lurk in its endless darkness.

I was getting pretty annoyed by the slow travel speed of the submarine we should have reached the bottom by now. It's like we are traveling for days but with no end in sight. We can't find what's making the strange signals the navy receives nor have we made it to the bottom of this trench.

I looked at the data we should have reached the bottom yesterday. Something is wrong. We have run out of good quality food. We are now using nonperishable canned food.

The crew is starting to suspect that something is wrong but it managed to convince them that we will soon reach the bottom. I have been trying to contact the navy but I can't contact them I only hear static on the radio.

 Tonight we managed to get a signal but it was weird it didn't sound human we thought that it was maybe a bad signal but no the signal was all good. Peter and I just looked at each other and listened. The signal lasted for ten minutes and then ended.

We don't see any more animals no fish no crabs not even bacteria. The only thing we have started to see is a huge amount of plastic trash.

 We have started getting even more of the strange signals I have started to suspect that these were the strange signals that the navy was getting. 

I think I can't control the crew for long they are starting to get louder about wanting to turn back and return to the surface. Even Antoni who supported me for so long was agreeing with the crew. 

As we are going down the more trash we find. I don't get how did this amount of trash get here.

Yesterday, I heard something knocking on the hatch. At first, I thought that I was imagining things but it got louder and louder. Even the crew heard it. The crew members kept their voices down so as not to disturb the rest of the crew that was sleeping, but they were all on edge and were starting to panic.

 I was scared to look at the radar but when I turned it on I saw one dot showing that something was outside of the submarine then there were two dots then five dots, ten dots, and thirty dots after a few minutes there were hundreds of dots on the radar.

 " what is going on here? " I asked.

The knocking increased and it was now on all of the submarine's surface. it was like they were trying to break the walls as and get inside. After an hour it stopped. We heard another shriek it was louder now, fortunately we didn't lose power this time.

If my calculations are right we should reach the area where the noise is coming from in about an hour.
I turned on my radar and the lights outside of the sub which were not used until now.

And then I saw the thing that was making all of these shrieks. We were separated only by some layers of plastic but I could see it. It was huge its big white eyes staring into my soul. I just looked at it and I felt compelled to come closer to it. I had never seen anything so beautiful in all my life. It looked like a giant snake with black markings on its body and large black horns protruding from its head. And then it spoke. It spoke to me in what sounded like an ancient language.  I couldn't understand it but I felt myself being pulled toward it. And my hands started steering the submarine towards it.

I would have almost done it if Antoni didn't stop me. He took some pictures of it and told me we should leave fast while we still can. And we did and the creature didn't even chase us it just watched. I was glad Antoni was there because I wasn't sure if I could have handled another encounter with that thing.

I decided that we have finished the mission and to head back to the surface. The creature roared and we lost power again. The engine stopped a few seconds after and we plummeted down fast and we reached the bottom. 

Now everyone was in a state of panic. I told them that we needed to calm down and see what we can do to get out of this situation. But the monster continued to speak and to my horror, I was the only one that could hear it. it seemed to be speaking directly into my mind. 

I looked at the engines they were damaged in the crash but they could be fixed, but it would take some time. We spent the 10 days at the bottom. The damages to the engines turned out to be more serious than I first thought it will take us more time to fix them to give us the chance to get to the surface. 

The food supply is dwindling. Jake has been pretty closed off recently he doesn't leave the infirmary which he turned Into his room. After Peter told me he didn't get out of his room for the last two days, I went to check up on him, and I brought him his favorite candy to cheer him up. I figured that was enough to make him happy for a while.

I entered the infirmary only to find that Jake had hung himself. In his suicide note, he wrote that the creature told him to do it. I told the crew that Jake had killed himself but I didn't mention the note.

We put his body in a body bag. It was only a matter of time till the body will start to decompose and smell.

We didn't hear any shrieking or get those strange signals. Hank came to me today and told me that Tom has started making a shrine to the creature in his cabin and is praying to the creature every day he even convinced some of the crewmen to join his cult. 

It was small at first but now half of the crew is a part of his cult. He told me as the captain I should put a stop to this before something bad happens.

I told him I will try. Peter and I went to Tom's cabin. We could hear weird chanting from inside. I opened the door and found Tom and the crewman praying to a shrine with Jake's head on it.Us opening the door stopped their prayer and they were now looking at us.

I yelled at them but they just look at me not even reacting. Tom was the only one that spoke and told me he was sorry but they needed to sacrifice something to our God before the next stage in his glories plan for us. He also said that Jake would be there to greet us when the next stage was over and that we should be ready.

 I stopped him right there and told him he was full of shit. And that when we get back to the surface he's going to answer for this.

With that, I left because I knew I couldn't do anything now that he's got half of the crew under his control.
Peter, Antoni, Hank, me, and the rest of the crew retread into the command room. I sat with Peter in the command room and I started going over the plan.

We armed ourselves with iron bars and with some knives that Toms's cultists didn't already take.

Our biggest problem was food and water. We needed to make constant runs to the submarine's storage to get some food which was less and less by the day.

We got a letter from one of Toms's cultists saying that everyone should join the Big festival before the next phase of the creator's plan.

I just burned the letter thinking that it was just one of their stupid rituals.

I later saw them gathering at the submarine's hatch. And Tom was giving them a speech about how they have done everything they were required to and it's time to meet their God.

They wanted to open the hatch and get out into the ocean. But they would drown us all if they did that. I ordered everyone to arm themselves and get ready to fight. Because if don't we will all die.

We charged into them while they were distracted. They were not armed so we managed to kill them all. It was a massacre.

The entire hallway was filled with blood on the floor.
It was horrible but we did what we must to survive.
The submarine was now ours. We can repair the engines and get out of here. 

To celebrate Peter made us a cocktail to celebrate our victory. Everyone had a glass to drink. While I went into the command room to check for a signal. I gave it a try even though I wasn't that optimistic I would get a reply on my radio. 

But I did and it was the Navy, they told me that they were happy to hear that we are alive and to hold on help is on its way.

I was so happy I rushed to the crew to deliver the good news. I found all of them laying on the floor dead, Antoni was still alive but barely. He acted scared when he saw me and didn't want me to help him, he tried to speak but couldn't because blood was coming out of his mouth and he died shortly after. 

Everyone was dead except Peter he wasn't there. I heard something was trying to open the hatch. I rushed there and found Peter. He was smiling when he saw me. I asked him if he poisoned the crew. He told me they were just wasting our time.

 I yelled at him that they were our friends and how could he kill them. He told me he didn't do anything it was I who poisoned the crew.

No, it wasn't me It couldn't be me I would never do that.

I did not kill any of them, it was not me.

He seemed amused by all of this.

 He told me that on the day I killed him by drowning him. His soul became a part of the ocean. He learned the truth humans didn't belong on land but in the ocean. We were punished by our creator for our sins and banished to land. 

And then we lost our ability to live in the water. The creator planned on bringing us back when we deserved it and atoned for our sins. But because we are mistreating the ocean by throwing our waste in it he changed his plan.

He's getting ready to submerge all land on earth and kill every human on this Earth. He is already rising the levels of the oceans but at a small rate because he is preparing for his final strike in which none will survive.

"He is offering you to join him. Accept his gifts and return to the ocean. The only thing you have to do is open the hatch and let me take you to him "Peter said.
 
"But what about Tom and his followers they were worshiping him why would he let us kill them?" I said.

"They weren't ready to join him even if they claimed they were". Peter said.

The radar in the command room was going crazy it registers that a huge mass was coming our way followed by hundred of other small creatures.

"What are those other things with him"?  I asked.

"They are something like humans but better because they are not mistakes they are perfect," Peter said.

 "He's waiting it's time for you to decide captain," Peter said

"But can't he give humanity another chance if I got to tell them what damage they were doing they would stop." I pleaded.

"Oh, they already know what they are doing is wrong but they are not stopping.  There won't be given another chance."Peter said 

"Now choose what will it be will you join us or die," Peter said 

 Peter offered his hand.

I thought about it I didn't have much choice.

"I'm sorry I killed you it was an accident I didn't know you were outside the submarine when we went underwater," I said

"That was a long time ago captain I forgive you now join me," Peter said.

I took his hand and stabbed him in the neck with my knife. He died in my arms I killed him again. I closed my eyes for a second and he was gone. Like he wasn't even here.

I looked at the radar and there was nothing outside the submarine.

I didn't know where the creature went but I will now try to get back to the surface before it returns.

I tried to start the engines and they turned on on my first try. I managed to return to the surface.

When the navy questioned me about what happened they didn't believe me when I told them about my best friend that died in an accident five years ago, was in our submarine, and that he killed some of the crew. They had me arrested for mass murder. I got sentenced to 18 years in prison.

As the years passed I wasn't sure what exactly happened in that submarine what was real or not.

But when I watched the news on the Tv they said that the ocean levels were dangerously rising and that experts say that it can't be stopped. Hundreds of people have been reported to have suspiciously drowned. That wouldn't be so scary if the prison I was in wasn't on an Island.

Last night I heard Peter calling my name I guess he's still alive somehow.

General Henry got me a lawyer to help me to reduce my sentence. When the lawyer visited me I told him to write down my story so I can warn other people. He did and when we finished I told him to give this to General Henry he was the only person I could count on with this and told him to share the story online.

If you are reading this avoid the ocean or any body of water they are everywhere now.

I was laying on my bed texting with my old schoolmate, talking about our old school days and how fun it was. As we we're talking my friend mentioned that our old school building was shut down because it was too small and it couldn't fit all of the students, so the city decided to rebuild it.  
So now the school is waiting to be rebuilt, hence why it's empty.

Couple of days later as I was walking home from work late in the evening I walked past my old school and I decided to check the place out one more time for good times sake. The school looked like any other in the area, three stories high and made up of bricks. Except this school had many large windows.

As I was walking through the courtyard the nostalgia hit me pretty hard, I saw the bench that me and my friends used as a ledge to skate on, and the ping pong table we used to play on and all the other things we used to pass time during recess. As I continued walking through the courtyard something caught my eye, the school cafeteria window was left open. When I went to take a closer look I noticed that the windows wooden frame where the lock was had something that looked like scratch marks, in my head I thought that it might had been a weird way for looters or teenagers to break it.

As I was looking around the curiosity got the best of me and I decided to go on a "treasure hunt".  
As I climbed through the cafeteria window and looked around the cafeteria it felt really eerie, but that's expected for an abandoned building. The cafeteria looked exactly the same when I attended the school, the big windows pointing out to the courtyard and the decorations filling the white cafeteria walls. It was really dark in there so I took out my phone and put the flashlight on, I walked through the cafeteria to the hallway where all of the lockers were and I tried to look for my old locker, when I finally found my locker I tried to open the lock but to my surprise it didn't open and suddenly a loud bang came from the second floor, as I heard the loud bang in my head I thought about getting the fuck out of there as quickly as possible, I've read a lot of horror during my free time and I always know that the one's who investigate get killed first but I know horror stories are not real so I decided to investigate.

As I walked up the stairs to the second floor a sudden reek of shit hit my nostrils and I almost puked. When I reached the second floor and looked towards the hallway to my right where the stink came from, I went and investigated the source of the smell, as I reached the end of the long hallway it was clear that the smell came from the classroom to my left. I reached my hand for the handle and opened the door then I pointed my flashlight to the classroom and I noticed that a bookshelf across the room had fallen over, and I thought to myself "This couldn't have fallen over on it's own". And that's when I saw something in the corner of my eye "Am I crazy?" is what I thought to myself before checking again.

There it was hanging in the upper corner of the classroom, it was tall, pale and zombie like with its eye's glowing white and claws the size of my head and it was staring at me emotionless. When suddenly it put itself down and I could clearly see how long its arms were, the monster started to run towards me screaming as loud as a siren and its arms were opened widely so it could catch me. I closed the door as quickly as possible and started running towards the stairs, as the monster was banging on the door I knew I couldn't make it in time for the stairs so I had to hide.

As I was franticly looking for a place to hide the only place that I could hide in was a opened locker. When I was inside the locker I could hear the door break down, then I saw the monster run past my locker and to the other end of the long hallway. As time went I could hear the creature breaking into other classrooms just to look for me, when I heard the creature run to the third floor I took my chance to run for the stairs. While I was making my way down the stairs I heard quick steps coming down from the third floor, then I started to run towards the cafeteria and I headed for the open window that lead to the courtyard. I decided to do a stupid thing and I looked back and I could see it running from the entrance of the cafeteria towards me and I just barely made it through the window.

I was still running because I didn't know if it was going to chase me outside but I didn't hear any footsteps. When I looked back at the school I could see it watching me with a smile from the window.

This happened four years ago and to this day when I walk past the school I swear I can still see it staring at me through the windows with a smile.

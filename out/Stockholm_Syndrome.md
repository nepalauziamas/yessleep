My name is Anna...and I have a stalker, but I like him. I know he likes me too...He's the only one I know who truly cares about me.....He wants me...he loves me. Even though he hurts me....even though he's hit me before. Even though he's tied me up and did unspeakable things to me...I still love him. I know this isn't normal....what do I do?

I've never felt loved, not by my family, I don't have friends who care about me. I'm all alone...I have no one. Not even an animal companion to keep me company.

That's why I'm so infatuated by him I suppose.

I've never called the police on him once, he wouldn't love me anymore if I did.

It all started when he followed me home for more than one night after work. I also saw him outside my home taking pictures of me doing ordinary things. Any person would've called the police or told the man to screw off. I didn't...I couldn't...as I've said before, I've never been loved nevertheless obsessed over. So I continued to allow him to stalk me, Even waving in his photos if I caught him with his camera. The feeling was euphoric to me. I think we've slowly become friends.

I remember one time my stalker broke into my house, tied my hands and feet, kidnapped me and took me to his house with his friends. I didn't scream or struggle, which is possibly why he didn't knock me out. I really liked his friends. They treated me fairly well, introduced themselves, and even cooked food for me. They said I looked cute and innocent. I was flattered by their compliments, yet I was scared...I don't know why I was scared of the one who cared for me so much. They dragged me to the basement and.....So many things happened that night...so much pain...so much crying...But I endured it all for him...but in the end he took me home and put me in my bed. I was exhausted...but happy to make my friend happy.

That wasn't the first time he's broken into my home either. He's done it when i'm sleeping, possibly to get close up pictures of me. It isn't the first time he's tied me up and (redacted). That was however, the first time he's kidnapped me..he hasn't done it since though.

Sometimes I wonder why he hasn't killed me yet. Is it because I'm cooperative? I would ask, but he likes to gag me when he ties me up so I've never had a chance to ask him.

I remember one time when he broke into my house and cornered me in my bathroom...he had a pocket knife in his hand which he used to cut the skin in my arms. He pinned me to the ground and hit me repeatedly. All the while calling me his little slave. It hurt so much, but I couldn't fight back. I loved him too much not to mention he'd probably overpower me if I tried anyway. That's just how it's been for the past weeks....just satisfying his desires. It's exhausting yet I love it so much. I just feel so happy to make him happy.

I love him so much....I know he hurts me badly in many ways but..I can't stop loving him....he's my best friend.

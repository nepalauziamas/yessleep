&#x200B;

I slammed my foot on the gas pedal and raced down the road as soon as I sent the text to Dawson. We didn't know what this creature was, I only briefly saw it in that man's yard, but I knew it wasn't a fucking person. It had to be some kind of entity, and now Dawson was in extreme danger.

I heard my radio turn on as I took multiple turns, trying to get to Dawson's house faster. I listened closely to the dispatcher on the radio.

**"We have just received a call from a man saying something was standing in his backyard. We need officers on route immediately."**

Shit. Dawson must've made a call.

The address was sent to me almost instantly as I took a closer look at it. I was already a couple of minutes away from Dawson's house. I needed to speed up.

My heart started beating a thousand times a second as I started thinking about what would happen to Dawson if I didn't make it there in time, what that thing would do if it got inside his home. I pressed my foot harder on the pedal to speed the car up and eventually watched Dawson's neighborhood come into view.

I took a quick turn, going into it, and turned my sirens on, praying that Dawson was still alive. He was my best friend, along with my partner. I couldn't lose him tonight, not after everything we've been through together as police officers.

As I drove further down the neighborhood, I saw Dawson's house and heard more police sirens behind me. I screeched to a stop in front of Dawson's house, quickly opening my door and stepping onto the cracked pavement.

"Damn it, Dawson, please still be alive," I muttered as I ran to the front door. As I made it up to the door, I started getting more scared about the possibility of what Dawson's state would be. I thought I had made it there on time, that I was relatively quick on getting here, but a part of me doubted it.

I tried the door handle, and it was unlocked. I watched as the door creaked open, the light from inside the house beaming into my eyes. He must've forgotten to lock the door when he got home.

I stepped foot into his house, and my eyes promptly moved towards the ceiling, expecting to see something there. There wasn't.

I moved my eyes back down and walked further in. My heart got stuck in my throat when I saw Dawson and Michelle's headless bodies laid out in front of the back door, Michelle's body ripped open from her chest down to her stomach, and Dawson's torso was cracked at every angle. Dawson's head was set on the back door handle. I didn't see Michelle's head anywhere.

Multiple officers came rushing into the house as I dropped to my knees, unable to move my eyes from Dawson and Michelle. I couldn't believe how brutally they were murdered, and it made me want to vomit, but I was unable to as tears started streaming from my eyes. My heart felt like it was lowering in my body as cops circled the bodies, examining them.

One of my co-workers kneeled down to me as I was still in utter disbelief and shock. He puts a hand on my shoulder.

"You okay, Christian?" He asks me. I shake my head, not saying anything. This was not only the scariest night of my life, but the worst day of my life.

I took a long look across at Dawson's head. There was something off with it. It didn't look entirely like Dawson, but I lost vision of it when another officer came in and got in front of my view.

I slowly got up, away from the grasp of my co-worker, and walked outside the house, sitting on the porch. I survey the street, searching for that creature that we've been getting calls about all that night, hoping I see it so I could end its existence.

There were no signs of it, though. The street was absent of anyone and anything. I wasn't going to be able to get redemption, and I would have to live with the fact that I had gotten to the house too late.

This was last week. My partner. My *best friend.* Was dead.

&#x200B;

**"Officers on duty, there is an active break-in currently going on at a woman's house. The address is being sent out immediately,"**

It has now been over a week since then, and today I was on my first shift since that night. I just needed time to cope with Dawson's death, and overall just needed a break from being a cop. I'm writing this on Dawson's account because he originally made this account for both of us to share, and I have to say, when I saw the post he made about our experience and read the end, I was creeped out.

I received the address and started driving there as fast as I could. It was only 6 minutes away. I turned on my sirens, hearing them wail in the night as I sped as fast as I could toward the address.

Before I knew it, I was closer to the house. I was getting ready to shoot at the intruder if I had to. Nearly a minute later, I showed up at the house before any other cop and quickly stopped in front of the driveway. I speedily opened my door and got out with my gun drawn.

I ran to the front of the house, noticing the front door was wide open. The intruder must've come in through the front. I don't hesitate as I run into the house with my gun held up high, but upon entering, the intruder runs full speed at the door, shoving me out the way as he runs out of the house.

I hear the woman screaming upstairs as I regain my balance and run down the porch steps, sprinting towards where he had gone. I took a right, beginning to run down a long sidewalk. Across me, only a few feet away, was the intruder.

He was no longer running and was instead now walking, breathing heavily. I watched him turn his head at me, widening his eyes and beginning to run again after seeing me. I was already close behind him, so I picked up my pace, chasing him down before I put my gun back in my holster, tackling him down to the ground, getting his face pressed against the concrete.

He begins struggling as I put my knee on his back, getting out my handcuffs as I try to get his arms to cuff him. He was a fighter. I'll give him that.

"Let me go, you stupid fuck!" He screams at me, struggling some more. I was finally able to cuff one of his wrists as I shook my head.

"Can't do that, bud," I say, trying to get the cuff around his other wrist. I watch as he looks up at me, smirking as he tries to spit on me, failing.

"Oh, I recognize you. That's why your partner got killed, bitch," He snarls up at me.

Upon hearing this comment, I lose control of my anger and slam his head into the concrete, to which he responds by trying to kick at me as I cuff his other wrist and get him up.

I start bringing him back down the road towards my patrol car as I see more cops beginning to get onto the scene. As I came around the corner onto the yard, an officer saw me and came up.

"We'll handle the rest from here. You take him back to the station," He points at the intruder. I nod my head.

"Sure thing," I respond, taking the intruder to my car. I open the backseat door and throw the intruder (just going to call him that) in, slamming the door shut. I walk around to the driver's seat, opening the door, and get in, letting out a sigh, slamming the door shut. I hear the intruder start trying to kick at my seat.

"Can't kick my seat, man," I say to him, slowly starting up the car. I hear the intruder let out a snort.

"You cops have time to stop some regular dude but not to stop some kind of interdimensional demon?" He avers at me.

I stay silent as I start driving, not bothering to look back at him as he continues speaking. "My brother was a victim of that thing, and you couldn't stop it," he yells at me, guilt starting to press into me.

"We tried our best," I calmly say back to him, turning out of the neighborhood. "I'm sorry about your brother,"

"Yeah, I'm sure you are," He snorts at me, leaning back into his seat. I sigh as I think back on that night. I saw the creature before, but I didn't shoot at it. I had the opportunity to possibly kill it, and I didn't take it. I've been blaming myself for all the deaths and pain that it's caused our community, even if people continue telling me that it isn't my fault. It is. Now, who the hell knows where it's at?

I start hearing my radio turn on as a dispatcher's voice starts coming in. I listen closely, driving onto an idle road.

**"All officers on duty, we have just received a call from somebody saying that something was standing out in their backyard. Arrive at the scene immediately."**

My heart begins sinking as I felt the nightmare start to begin again. Was it really happening again? Did this call have any correlation? No, it was just a regular disturbance call. That's what it was. I continued telling myself that as I continued driving down the road.

My momentary peace from what I was telling myself shattered when I heard my radio turn on again. **"We have just received another call from a man saying something was walking around his property. We need officers on route immediately."**

"Oh, shit..." I mutter to myself as I receive one of the addresses. I look at it. 5 minutes away. I started to go on the route.

The intruder starts trying to say something to me, but I tune him out as I continue driving to the address. I heard my radio turn on again as I started getting the same feeling I did that night. Overwhelming fear.

**"We have gotten another call from somebody saying some creature was roaming around in their backyard. Officers need to check out the area immediately- What is that?"** The dispatcher starts suddenly talking in a worried tone, unsettling me.

**"What the hell is that outside the door? Darren, can you go check that out, I..."** On the other end, I heard a loud bang, like a door was being knocked from its hinges and crashed to the floor. It was followed shortly by screaming. **"IT'S IN THE ROOM, IT'S IN THE ROOM, OH GOD HELP US, HELP US-"** The line got cut off.

There's silence in the car for a while. I stare ahead at the empty road as I slow down the car. The realization started to hit me, making me terrified. It was a realization I never wanted to feel, and it has become a reality.

The creature was back.

The silence continues as I wait for my radio to turn on, hoping that I'd hear the dispatchers say they were okay, that they were alive, but it never happened. My radio never turned on again. I never heard the dispatcher's voice.

As I continued driving down the road, the fear continuing to build in me, I noticed a body on the side of the road, lifeless.

I immediately halt the car to a stop and unlock the door. I step out, closing the door behind me to avoid the intruder climbing up to the front to escape. I kept my hand on my gun in my holster as I approached the body. It looked like it was a cop.

After realizing this, I started jogging closer to the body to see who it was, to see if I could get this officer some help. As I got closer, though, I stopped in my tracks, my breathing starting to get heavier, my heart getting in my throat.

The body on the ground, dead. Was me. A body identical to *me.*

I take a step back in fear as I see blood everywhere. I take a look at the neck. It looked like something sharp had stabbed 'me' in the neck, killing me.

I didn't understand. It didn't make sense. How could this look exactly like me? How could I be dead? I began remembering back to Dawson's post, when he got to his house and saw heads that looked like him and Michelle strewed about in their house. I remember back to when I arrived at his house and saw their headless corpses.

Oh shit.

My thoughts get interrupted by the sound of the intruder screaming from the backseat far behind me. I whirled my body around to see what was going on. I was horrified when I saw the creature, the rear door wide open, dragging the intruder out of the car.

The same creature that killed Dawson.

The intruder continues screaming as the creature continues dragging him out. I can only watch as the creature opens his mouth and brings his teeth down on the intruder's face, gnawing on his head as blood gushes out in an instant. I watch the intruder go limp, his screams no longer coming out.

I pull my gun from my holster, trembling as I point it at the creature, who was still gnawing on the intruder's head. It eventually noticed me and turned its head to stare at me. I saw its eyes. There was nothing but darkness and evil in them. It was an abomination. Those damned eyes.

I squeeze the trigger as hard as I could, wincing as I do so, firing a bullet at the creature, watching as it goes straight into its head.

After the shot, the creature's hands slowly slipped off the intruder's head, falling onto its knees, and then onto its back, limp. I quickly walk over to it, lowering my gun. I took a look down at it, the fear still present. The creature was lifeless.

I had killed it.

I put my gun back in my holster as I started to get tears in my eyes. I couldn't believe it. I had just avenged my partner, and I avenged everyone else it killed, and possibly saved the rest of the town. I looked at the intruder, who was already dead. Half of his head was gone and there was blood everywhere. There were pieces of the creature's teeth plunged into his forehead.

I took a step back, looking up at the sky, sniffling. I imagined Dawson up in heaven, looking down at me, proud.

"I did it, Dawson," I whispered. "I killed it," I looked back down at the ground, reaching for my radio to see if there were still any dispatchers alive, but the sense of dread returned back to me as I started to feel another presence. A presence right behind me.

I slowly lifted my head as my heart went back into my throat, the fear growing stronger once again. I slowly turned my head and saw the same creature standing behind me, looking at me.

I moved my eyes back and saw the same creature on the ground, dead. That's when it all came to me horrifically.

There was more than one.

The creature that was behind me aggressively grabbed the back of my head and forced me down to my knees. It brought its head around to face me and stared dead into my eyes, showing its teeth and claws at me. It had the same exact features as the one I had killed. As it stared at me more, I knew that it was *angry,*

I started to yell for help, hoping that somebody would hear and help me, but it was no use. I was on a deserted road. Nobody would hear my horrid screams. My yells were then cut off as the creature raises its arm stabs me with its claws, deep into my neck

Its claws cut deeper into my neck before it finally pulls them out, blood spitting out of my neck like machine gun bullets. The creature drops me to the floor as I desperately hold onto my neck, trying to slow down the bleeding. I rolled over to my back, gasping for air, and saw the creature standing over me. I looked at the spot I had seen the body that looked like me. It was no longer there.

I looked back at the creature as it stared dead into my eyes, and I started to lose all feeling in my body, all the sense in my mind. I got trapped in its gaze as I felt the warm blood spilling onto my hand. I felt... Abstracted. Its unnatural shape looking more like a void than it ever did before.

It was only a second later that I blacked out.

&#x200B;

When I woke up next, I was in darkness. Pure, unprecedented darkness. Like the darkness you see when you close your eyes. I was able to move, though. I got up, putting a hand to my neck, pressing against it. I didn't feel any blood. In fact, I didn't feel any wound on my neck.

I started walking around, looking for something else in the tenebrosity of the setting I was in. I was desperately looking for something, someone.

"Hello?" I shouted at absolutely no one, in an attempt to find somebody else, but I heard my voice echo, with no signs of anyone coming.

I started questioning whether or not I was dead. I seemed to be in some sort of afterlife, but I didn't feel dead. I felt like I was moving around in the constant darkness for hours, my legs were burning, and I was tired. I fell onto my knees, trying to crawl, but I couldn't. I fell flat on my face, unable to move.

I lifted my head back up a minute later, my eyes continuing to search, my efforts getting weaker and weaker until I saw somebody in the distance. My eyes locked on the person I saw as I slowly rose myself to my feet, walking over with the remaining strength I had in my legs. They were just looking at me, slowly waving at me. I started walking faster.

As I got closer, as the blackness started to lighten up around me, they looked familiar, and my eyes lit up when I saw who it was.

It was Dawson.

"Dawson?" I said to him once I got in front of him. I let out a smile as he smiled back. I was happy to see him again, even if I didn't know where I was. I felt oddly comforted now.

"Hey, Christian," Dawson says to me. I didn't know how to respond. All I did was wrap my arms around him in a hug, patting him on the back. I felt him pat me on the back as well as I let out a sniffle. It's only been a week, but it felt so much longer.

When I pulled away, I looked around me some more. "Where are we?" I ask him. I didn't get a response for a second.

"You're nowhere," Dawson simply responds, nodding his head. I give him a confused look. Nowhere?

"What do you mean nowhere?" I start feeling disoriented. It was like I was going on a bad trip. It was sudden. It felt... weird. The color around me started going from black to white, to grey, and back to black.

"You're nowhere," Dawson repeats himself. My vision started getting blurry, and I started feeling dizzy, the color changing faster now. I started losing my balance as I looked back at Dawson.

"But what is nowhere?" I stutter. I start getting so dizzy that I fall on my ass and I start losing all sense of direction. I start looking around for Dawson, taking me a while before finding him again.

I started trying to get up but I couldn't. I continued looking at Dawson, but his eyes... His eyes were different. His eyes looked evil. His eyes had only darkness in them.

"You're nowhere, Christian," Dawson says again, his voice now deep and demonic. He started laughing, his sinister laughs echoing throughout this world I was in, his eyes continuing to get darker as he continued looking at me.

"DAWSON!" I shouted at him. I tried getting to my knees, but I fell back down, my vision getting worse and worse. I kept trying to get up, but I failed every time. I was absolutely terrified. I didn't know what was happening. My voice started to quiver as Dawson continued to laugh. I felt myself begin to cry when I realized that this wasn't Dawson.

"DAWSON, DAWSON!" I gave one more desperate scream up at him, one last attempt to break whatever I was in before I blacked out again. No more noise. Just silence as I felt myself start to wake up again.

I woke up again where I was before, on the same deserted road. There were multiple cops in the area now, investigating the intruder's body, and checking out the creature's body. I looked up and saw a cop kneeling over me, putting a piece of his attire over my wound.

"Oh, oh..." I breathed a sigh of relief. "I thought I was dead,"

"Nope, but for a second, we thought you were," The cop replied to me, continuing to add pressure to my wound to stop the bleeding. He continued talking. "You're a real hero, Christian. You killed the monster,"

I glanced at all the cops, who were now starting to circle around me, nodding their heads. I look back up at the cop beside me.

"Hell yeah I did," I chuckled a little bit, instantly stopping as it started to hurt my neck. "Ow... But, there are more of those creatures out there, we need to find them and kill them, that wasn't the only one-" I start desperately saying before the cop puts a hand over my mouth, making me unable to speak.

"Oh, we know," the cop then lets out a twisted, nasty smile at me. I watched as the cop slowly turned into the creature. I heard bones shifting and cracking as it did so. I was immediately petrified as the other cops around me did the same thing, turning into the same creatures.

They all looked down at me, and I had no choice other than to look into their eyes, the darkness of them, as it was the only thing I could look at.

I felt the pressure on my neck go away as the blood started oozing more.

The creature kneeling beside me gets up as I get lost in their dark eyes, the fear remaining, but every other feeling left my body. I was numb, and as all the creatures stood beside me, knowing there was always more than one made the situation so much worst.

I couldn't move or do anything, but only one thought crossed my mind, and even though I didn't have the energy to reach for my phone, I had the urge.

I reached into my pocket, managed to pull out my phone, and dialed 911, in an attempt to get help from any dispatchers possibly alive.

Five years ago, I won something I didn't remember signing up for- except, I posted that [yesterday.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/6187z2/i_won_something_i_dont_remember_signing_up_for/)  I mean, I guess not literally- it's alledgedly been five years, so I should've graduated by now.  Buildings on campus are different, my bikes gone, and there's an apartment building where my house should be.  Plus I still can't get ahold of anyone- I mean ANYONE, not even my parents- though worst of all, it feels like everyone, I mean -everyone-, is just *ignoring* me.

---------------

Let's start from the top.  It's March of 2017, and I was set to accept the McCaffrey Scholastic grant- something I'd won unexpectedly, and something I couldn't find a shred of information on.  Despite feeling like something was off, all of my family and friends encouraged me to just take the money so the next day, after a few morning lectures, I swung by the building to check it out.  Thin- at least for a building on campus- but dauntingly tall, with charcoal black masonry and the most perfectly white windows you could imagine, though shaded just enough where it was difficult to see inside.  I felt a little anxious stepping inside, because I mean again I had no idea why they'd selected me, but the main foyer was average enough to ease my nerves.  A man sat behind a circular desk, with thick tortoise glasses and a wrinkled white button up, and as I walked through the door he almost immediately greeted me with a startled yelp.

"Oh!  I, erm... hello!  We don't get too many visitors here, are you here for an appointment?"  The closer I got to the desk, the stranger he seemed; like his almost robotic voice, or his lack of sweat (despite it being at least 90 degrees in that fucker), or how his face was just a bit too *average*, something about the placement of his features...  

Quickly though, I recovered.  "Yes, um, my name's [█████ ███████], and I'm here about the, uhm... McCaffrey Scholastic Grant?  T-they didn't give me a specific time or anything, just t-"  

"... to show up before 5 PM!  Yes, splendid, apologies for not recognizing you.  The panel will be seeing you shortly, if I could just ask you a quick few questions?"  His demeanor seemed calmer now, but there was still something super offputting about the way he seemed to leer at me. 

I nodded, and from a drawer out of my line of vision, he pulled up a dusty old manilla folder, flicking through several pages before stopping with a satisfied "ahhh".  

"How often a week would you say you exercise?"  "When you dream, how often do you find yourself living the life of someone else?"  "Do you try to maintain a regular eating schedule?"  "Does staring down from exceptional heights cause you discomfort?"  "Anything of concern in your family's medical history?"  "Do you ever fantasize about people you've never met or heard of?"  "Have you ever had any close encounters with death?"  "Can you remember a time in your life you felt true terror?"  "Would you call yourself an observant person?"  "Do you ever want to just slink into the wallpaper and disappear?"

I blinked a few times at that last one.  Some of the questions- and there were WAAAAY more than the few I just listed, this had been going on for what I felt like hours now- were weird, sure, but nothing had quite made me stop in my tracks like this one.  "I.... uhm... all the time."  My voice felt shakey as I spoke, but at the same time, I felt relief; my hands stopped feeling so *clammy* and the man across from me finally seemed satisified with my answers.  

"Alrightie then, sorry that took so long!  If you'll just step in right over **there**."  He lifted up one of his hands to point out towards a red door marked "B32" on the side of the room that I swear hadn't been there before, but I gave him a cursory nod and made my way over.  As my hand touched clasped around the old brass doorknob, I felt a weird twang of hesitation burst out in my head, but I managed to shake it off and step right through.  

Step right through... and.... and then...

Look, I'm not trying to skip through the meeting or anything, but here's another scary thing.  I don't remember it.  *Any* of it.  I took a step through that door, and next thing I know, I was outside again.  What's most uncomfortable is, at the time, it didn't seem that strange- it felt like I had just sort of woken up from a dream, a little foggy, but I could remember being in the room, talking to someone... some people... something...

I found myself idlely pulling my phone out for what felt like the first time in hours, glancing down to see if I'd missed anything when I noticed it was dead.  That was weird.  I know I'd charged it up fully the night before, and it was brand fuckin' new- no way Apple had screwed me over again with a faulty battery.  My head flicked up as I realized it was dark out too.  That was even weirder- I'd gone in at like, 1 PM tops, and there was no way it had taken that long.  I tried to put together what had happened again, strolling down towards where I'd locked up my bike earlier that day when I looked up and saw the Dome in the background.  

The roof was completely different.  Where just earlier that morning it had a [flat](https://www.cnyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/0317-syracuse-university-carrier-dome-general-view-1980jpg-45243874d26d9099.jpg) smooth rooftop - one I'd known my entire life growing up rootin' for the Orange- in it's place, a [massive](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/96/VMWHPJCVBJGQ7F7ADBZ6LYRFTY.jpg) almost rollercoaster like fixed roof had replaced it, something I knew damn well would've taken years to complete.  

That's when I started to really panic.

My house?  A new apartment building where it used to be.  Friends houses?  New tenants, blank faces staring back at me.  I even tried my advisors office, only to find that she'd retired two years ago and that the registrar wasn't in on Fridays; but I had walked into McCaffrey Hall on a -Tuesday-.  I tried to buy a phone charger, but the clerk didn't seem to register me past our first few words of interaction, so I just walked out with it (which he literally watched me do without protest) and plugged it in at a pizza shop a few stores down.  When my phone finally spurred back to life, I was just looking at a factory reset phone, with the blank "Set Up New iPhone" facing back at me.  But then, weirdest of all - it just wouldn't register my fingers on the touch screen!  Apple, ladies and gentleman- never fucking reliable.  

Needless to say, though, I'm fucking spooked.  I spent the night trying to rationalize what the hell could've gone down with the help of a friendly 6-pack of Pabst, only to eventually find myself wandering down the silent street near Life Sciences once more.  The bell towers in the distance were starting to ring- the real ones on campus, of course, not that fraud of a tower you could see at McCaffrey- marking the end of the day, and I almost let out a scream of rage as I pulled out another beer.  I didn't give a shit if campus security busted me at this point- in fact, if anything, I was angrier that they hadn't yet.  No one seemed to notice me.  I'd fucking vanished.  

But speaking of disappearing acts, just as I came to the rear side of the science building, my jaw dropped as the beer fell from my hand.  McCaffrey Hall was gone.  There wasn't anything in it's place- it was like the block had shrunk the distance where it had once stood, and now just a couple of ugly frat houses remained visible in the distance to the corner.  This time, I actually did scream.  Louder than I maybe ever had in my life- a mix of absolute rage, but also utter fear.  

No one heard me, of course.  I found a computer someone had left logged in at the library- surprise, surprise, my login credentials weren't working anymore either- and that's when I started piecing a few things together.  You'd think the date would've thrown me off the most, but by this point, my brain was fried and skipping forward a few years actually helped explain a few things.  I couldn't login to any of my social media, reddit included, but I did go back and find my original post- the only piece online I can find that shows I actually *exist*- and that's when I saw the scariest thing of all.  

Someone's been posting.  On my account.  About basketball (the Warriors lost KD... but we still won another one?!), about TV shows, even about wrestling- all things I actually like.  As if the person's me.  But... they can't be me.  Because I'm me.  So who the fuck is u/rttrumbl ?

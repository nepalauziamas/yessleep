A few months ago I met a guy on Tinder, lets call him **Mark** (yeah I know, really unoriginal). 

We chatted on and off, but we could not meet because he had been sendt abroad for work and was not scheduled to return until next year.

During our chats I started to like him more and more, and it made me really sad that I could not meet him.

As the weeks passed by our chats became more and more intimate, we also started video calling each other on WhatsApp. One thing led to another and before I knew it we started sexting and having video sessions where we masturbated and brought ourselves to orgasm in front of each other.

We also took pleasure in commanding each others into doing kind of weird sexual things out of our own comfort zone. Things like masturbating in public areas like dressing rooms, trying different adult toys, peeing in front of each other. OK, maybe things like this is not exactly weird to everyone, but for me - not being very sexually experienced - it was weird at the time.

*It was like we really dated, only we had never actually met.*

Fast forward to five weeks ago when Mark said he was going to spend his summer holiday - combined with some work - in Albania, near the greek border. He asked if I wanted to come and join him for a week.

Although my feelings for him was strong, I had never actually met him in person, therefore it was with a certain skepticism I accepted his invitation.

About two weeks later I found myself on a transatlantic flight with a stomach full of butterflies, eager to meet this wonderful man in person.

Mark waited for me at the airport when I arrived. When I first saw him I thought that I couldn't be him. He looked so much better IRL. Like a real-life mix of bearded Ken and G.I. Joe, only 100 times as good looking.

I inhaled his wonderful scent as we hugged, then he kissed me on the cheek before we went to the car. Of course he carried the bag for me. A real gentleman.

Mark hadn't told me much about what he was doing for a living, only that he had a fancy job in private sector. When I saw the car he was driving - an Aston Martin of some sort - I started to get second thoughts about this relationship. \*Why would a man like that date a girl like me?\*

Mark had booked us a suite in a 5 star hotel, with a king size bed, a separated lounge/living room and a huge bathroom - with a jacuzzi.

I've seen the Tinder swindler documentary, and I'm not naive, but I figured I could give it a try. If Mark didn't turn out to be the man I thought he was, then at least I had gotten a week in luxury.

Mark wanted to take me out for dinner after he had showed me the suite. I wanted to take a shower first after the long flight so Mark agreed to wait until I had showered.

I undressed in the bathroom, sat on the toilet to relieve myself - *I had tried to use the planes toilets as little as possible* \- and then I got in the shower. The warm water felt amazing against my naked body.

I soaped up my body and shampooed my hair. When I turned around to rinse the shampoo out of my hair i saw Mark standing inside the shower cabinet with me. Naked. His huge penis pointing straight at me. He wrapped his arms around me and started kissing me. Whispering in my ear that he couldn't wait any longer.

We started making out, his strong hands held my body firm against his. He grabbed my butt, and fondled my breasts while we made out. He lifted me up in his strong arms, put my legs around his hips and his huge, hard dick inside my tight, warm and wet pussy. Mark leaned me against the wall fucked me.

The sensations as his penis went in and out of my pussy was amazing, I moaned softly into his ear. Please don't stop, I said. It feels so good!

Mark grunted as he fucked me harder and harder. Then I felt something pressing agains my anus. Pushing inside. Started to fuck my ass. The feeling was overwhelming, being taken in both holes like this, while his strong hands supported my thighs. I didn't think at the moment, as I was overwhelmed by the approaching orgasm.

I started moaning louder and louder as he fucked me harder and harder. My body started shaking, my legs clenching harder around his hips. Mark released his warm cum inside my vagina at the same moment as my own orgasm rolled through my body. It was indescribably sensational, and I think I passed out from the orgasm.

When I woke up I found myself in  bed, naked under the sheets. Mark had dried me and carried me to the bed to let me wake up comfortably there. He was sitting in a chair by the side of the bed, watching me, smiling.

The rest of the week with Mark went by too fast. We went to the beach, ate at the best restaurants, and enjoyed each other in bed. It was terrible having to say goodby to him at the airport, but he promised I would see him soon.

It's been two weeks since I came home, and I'm freaking out. My stomach has a visible bulge - I think I may be pregnant. And sometimes when I close my eyes, I kind of get a glimpse of what looks like a tale from right before I passed out.

I'm sitting on the toilet with a pregnancy test in my hand. I haven't [checked the result yet](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vtolme/im_pregnant/). I'm scared...

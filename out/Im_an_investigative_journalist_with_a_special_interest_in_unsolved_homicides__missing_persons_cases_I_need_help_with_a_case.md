Hey nosleep! I'm not totally sure how to start this so I guess I'll just jump in. I'm an journalist on a true crime podcast with a major radio network in the US. I'm not going to give you more information than that because there's a not insignificant chance you've at least heard of my show and I'm not interested in giving up my anonymity. Or risking my job (hence the throwaway account -- my usual reddit account is not very anonymous.) But I have this case I'm working on right now and, honestly, it's got me stumped. I'm hoping if I share some of it here, y'all might have some ideas for me.

I'm one of the hosts on this true crime podcast that mostly covers unsolved homicides and missing persons cases. I have a public email address that I share on every episode and in the show notes, so people can send me stories and leads and stuff. I get a LOT of emails, and to be honest I write a lot of them off as bogus, but I do get good ones that I end up researching and recording episodes on. The podcast is billed as "investigative journalism," but I don't honestly do a lot of investigating. I do internet research, I call local police departments and other sources, I wheedle information out of anyone I can, but I don't do any boots-on-the-ground investigating. Until recently. I'm going to tell this story with fake people and place names because it's easier than using vague pronouns. So let's say this takes place in a little New England town called Kent, Massachusetts.

&#x200B;

This particular email came in late at night, when I was about to shut the computer and go to bed. I've been doing this for nearly four years and my podcast (more because of the notoriety of the network than me) has a pretty big following, so I'm no stranger to disturbing, gory emails. But the further I read this email, the more gruesome the story got. My attention was initially struck by a link that read (using a fake website here obviously)

>[www.kentma.com/news/breaking/knight-boy-acquitted-halloween-triple-homicide](http://www.kentma.com/news/breaking/knight-boy-acquitted-halloween-triple-homicide)

I clicked the link before I read the email, but it was just a blurb, not even a full article, from six years ago.

>"The trial for the triple homicide of Kent High School students Ashley Briar, 18, Rose Thorpe, 17, and Matthew Ryan, 17, on the night of October 31st, 2012, comes to a screeching halt as Victor Knight, age 11, is acquitted for the crime after the defense presented screen shots and data logs proving that Knight was playing a video game online at the time the crime was committed. No other suspects have been brought forth at this time. More tonight at 8."

I sat back in my desk chair, dumbfounded. A triple homicide, seven years ago, less than a hundred miles away from where I was currently sitting, and an *eleven year old boy* was the primary suspect. How had I never heard about this? Seven years ago I was a freshman in college, taking my first journalism course at UMass Hopkinton, even closer to Kent than where I lived now. I couldn’t believe we never talked about this case.

The article was frustratingly short and I was about to start furiously Googling when I remembered there was an actual email waiting for me. I went back to it, and at first I was sure it was from a kid, maybe a high schooler doing a school project who came across the story. I get more of those than you might expect. But I realized pretty quickly that this email didn't come from a kid--it came from a cop. And not just any cop -- it was from one of the responding officers to the initial 911 call that reported the bodies, Jerry O’Rourke.

>This case broke me. I thought once the FBI took over, I could shake it and move on, but I never got those faces, that heinous crime scene, out of my head. I still take pills to sleep.

That got me. It’s not often you hear a cop confess to being screwed up by a case, or by anything, actually. In his email, Jerry explained that he was forty-eight when the crime occurred, and planned to stay on the force until he was required to retire at age sixty-five. He liked being a police officer and felt that he was doing really good work for his community. Then this crime happened. He was writing to me on the night of his fifty-fifth birthday, when he became eligible for maximum pension benefits and immediately retired.

Jerry gave me a brief rundown of the case:

Around eight in the morning of November 1, 2015, an elderly lady was walking her dog in the woods behind her house. She came across what she first thought was the leftovers of a Halloween prank, because of the way the bodies were posed and dressed, until she got close enough.

It was three students from the local high school: Ashley Briar, Rose Thorpe, and Matthew Ryan. All three were seniors and heavily involved in varsity football and cheerleading. It was, as Jerry said, a heinous crime scene, although it was even worse than I knew from that initial email.

Ashley and Rose were wearing their cheerleading uniforms, holding their pom-poms, arms stuck out in cheerleader-y ways. Matt was wearing his football jersey, pads, and helmet, and had a football tucked under one arm. All three of them bore evidence of brutal, fatal wounds to their heads, necks, and torsos.

Within a few weeks, an eleven-year-old boy was arrested for the murders. Jerry didn’t go into details about Victor Knight’s arrest, simply saying that they had a decent case against him. But when the case went to court, the defense turned up something that the police had missed, or not bothered to look for in the first place: Victor had an airtight alibi.

The night that the crime was committed, Victor was playing video games in his room. But he wasn’t just playing Xbox by himself: he was playing an online multiplayer game while video chatting with friends. The game generated a log which proved not only that Victor was logged in at the time of the murder, but that he was actively playing, meaning that he wasn’t logged in but actually off committing a triple homicide. Furthermore, his friends had multiple screen grabs of the video chat, showing Victor’s face with timestamps proving he was sitting at his desk playing a video game when the murders occurred.

So Victor was acquitted, and there were no other suspects. The case went cold.

I ravaged the internet for any more information, but there was shockingly little. You would think that such a strange and gruesome case would garner national attention, but you’d be surprised by how many horrible murder cases go with very little media coverage. What was really strange to me was that there was almost nothing on the Kent, MA website, which seemed to be a pretty solid news source otherwise. How was this not all over the local news?

I leaned back in my chair and rubbed bleary eyes. It was almost three in the morning. I sent Jerry O’Rourke a response saying I’d be in town tomorrow, booked a hotel, and slept for a few hours before making the two hour drive from Boston to Kent. I was completely wired the whole way, partly from all the caffeine I’d consumed to make up for my sleepless night and partly because I was already obsessed with this case and determined to solve it.

&#x200B;

I arrived in Kent, MA (again, a totally fictionalized location) the next morning and met Jerry, per an email, at a diner. He gave me as much information as he felt like he could ("Now that I’m off the force and they can’t fire me, I had to do something. This case…it haunts my nightmares.  I don't want them taking away my pension, I don't even know if they can, come to think of it, but I’ll tell you what I can.") I spent the next few days driving around Kent, talking to whomever I could, digging as deep as I could. I had the sense from talking to Jerry that the police department probably wouldn't be thrilled to talk to me, so I kind of skirted around the edges until I figured out what I was dealing with. And it was not at all what I expected.

Here's what I know about this case: On Halloween, 2015, Kent High School held their annual Halloween football game. Ashley, Rose, and Matt were all involved in the game, Matt as starting kicker and Ashley and Rose cheering. After the game, most of the football and cheerleading teams, as well as other Kent High students, convened at another student's house for a party. This was the kind of house where the parents never seemed to be around, and indeed they were on vacation this particular weekend. Somewhere between 12:30 in the morning, when Rose left the party, and 8am, three students were dead, brutally murdered.

Victor Knight was suspected because he was the little brother of another cheerleader, Haley Knight, who had killed herself the previous spring after relentless bullying by the cheerleaders.  And even though he was four years younger, Victor seemed to feel protective over his sister, and he was furious with the way she was treated. He had threatened violence against the kids who messed with his sister, more than once. Jerry called Victor "troubled," by which he meant that Victor was a withdrawn, sullen teenager, who didn’t have a ton of friends and spent most of his free time playing video games. He was chronically late or absent from school, and had a perpetual bad attitude; he gave all his teachers crap for everything from assigning homework to forcing him to participate in gym. He claimed to hate everyone except for a very small minority, which included his sister. Victor was devastated by her death, and blamed her bullies, which probably wasn't entirely wrong although there's a lot of evidence that Haley was severely depressed, and he talked about, in Jerry's words, "avenging" her.

Immediately I was suspicious of this theory. Victor Knight was eleven when three varsity athletes, at least six years older than him, were murdered. I remembered my little brother at eleven, when he weighed like seventy pounds and couldn't have beat me in a arm wrestle. Victor Knight, however, was nothing like my scrawny little brother. I got my hands both the middle and high school yearbooks from the spring of 2015, before the crime was committed. Ashley and Rose were both flyers on the cheerleading team, the ones who get thrown up into the air, and they were both extremely petite. I found a picture of Matt, too, and he was the smallest member of the football team by a large margin. It was like the three tiniest varsity athletes in that high school were murdered that night.

And Victor was about five-foot-eight and a hundred and eighty pounds at eleven years old. There's a picture of him in that yearbook standing with the wrestling team and he's head and shoulders above everyone else except the coach. And, as a wrestler, he was strong and agile. Suddenly it didn't seem so weird that he could have done this.

But it didn't matter, right? Because he had an alibi.

I found out from the newspaper archives that the woman who found the bodies was an old lady named Helen Jones, and she lived in a neighborhood we'll call Brookside Hills, which backed up to the woods where the bodies were found. I went there, hoping to talk to her or anyone else who might have insight. I came across an old lady tending a tidy little garden in the front of one of the matching beige houses, with a little white dog sniffing around her ankles and I got one interesting thing out of her:

"Of course, many of us have our suspicions."

"The Knight kid?"

She laughed bitterly. “Well, some people maintain that his alibi was faked. But, no, I meant…well, my neighbor Karen…” she trailed off, and I silently willed her to finish the sentence. “Never mind. I don’t like to talk about it. Come, Henry.” She pulled a treat from the pocket of her apron and Henry lost interest in me immediately. I watched him go, and wondered who Karen suspected over Victor Knight.

Walking back to my car, I stopped and really looked at the woods, and I realized -- they really weren't woods. Standing a hundred yards away from the tree line, I could see the highway on the other side. It was really just a thin strip of trees, largely cleared of brush, that I suspected had been left in place or cultivated for the simple purpose of blocking sound from the highway to the neighborhood. Even at night, with the powerful-looking streetlamps in the neighborhood and the lights of the highway on the other side, I didn’t think it would provide much cover. In other words, it wasn’t a great place to commit a murder. Or three.

I had to cut through someone's lawn to get to the trees, which were mostly smallish pines and pretty sparse. There was hardly any brush. I didn't know exactly where the bodies were found, but it wasn't a long stretch trees, so I started to walk. I don't know what I was thinking, if maybe there would be a memorial or something, and I didn't think there would be any kind of forensic evidence now, seven years later, but I felt compelled to find the spot, if I could.

It was just a few houses down from Helen's. Three white wooden crosses had been stuck into the dirt, which made the spot look like Calvary, where Jesus was crucified with those two others. It looked like someone was trying to plant flowers, but they were all withered, even the mums that should have been in full bloom in early October. It looked like something had been written on the central cross, and as I stepped forward to get a closer look, my foot hit something horribly squishy.

It was a dead rabbit, but it didn't look like it had been killed by an animal or something. I kind of nudged it with my shoe and then gasped. Someone had slit the throat.

I was suddenly overcome with terror. It hit me all at once what I was doing here, what had happened here, and that something was very wrong in this place. I wanted to run back to my car but before I did I saw what was written on the central cross.

*NEVER FORGET*

It wasn't written in an elegant hand, with a heart or anything pretty. It was carved into the wood as though with a dull knife, all sharp corners and splintered wood. Worse, there was a smear of what could only have been blood underneath the words, as though to underline them.

My heart was pounding in my throat. What had I gotten myself into? What was going on here? I took a slow step away from the memorial, and then another, and just as I was about to break into a run, something grabbed my wrist. I turned and screamed, yanking my hand free, expecting to see my assailant, but there was no one there. My wrist felt weird, wet and warm, and I looked down to see a smear of blood across my wrist. I seized up in terror as I felt hot breath on the back of my neck. I was too afraid to look. I was frozen in place. Somewhere in the back of my panic-stricken mind, I realized that there was no sound around me. Everything had gone completely and utterly silent.

And then, a quiet voice whispered in my ear.

*"NEVER FORGET."*

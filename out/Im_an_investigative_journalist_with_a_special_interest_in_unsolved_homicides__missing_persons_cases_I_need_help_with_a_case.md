Hey nosleep! I'm not totally sure how to start this so I guess I'll just jump in. I'm an journalist on a true crime podcast with a moderately-sized radio network in the US. I'm not going to give you more information than that because there's a not insignificant chance you've at least heard of my show and I'm not interested in giving up my anonymity. Or risking my job (hence the throwaway account -- my usual reddit account is not very anonymous.) But I have this case I'm working on right now and, honestly, it's got me stuck in the mud. I'm hoping if I share some of it here, y'all might have some ideas for me. But first, let me share a little bit about me.

&#x200B;

I'm one of the hosts on this true crime podcast that mostly covers unsolved homicides and missing persons cases. I have a public email address that I share on every episode and in the show notes, so people can send me stories and leads and stuff. I get a LOT of emails, and to be honest I write a lot of them off as bogus, but I do get good ones that I end up researching and recording episodes on. The podcast is billed as "investigative journalism," but I don't honestly do a lot of investigating. I do internet research, I call local police departments and other sources, I wheedle information out of anyone I can, but I don't do any boots-on-the-ground investigating. Until recently. I'm going to tell this story with fake people and place names because it's easier than using vague pronouns. So let's say this takes place in a little New England town called Kent, Massachusetts.

This particular email came in late at night, when I was about to shut the computer and go to bed. My attention was initially struck by a link that read (using a fake website here obviously)

>[www.kentma.com/news/breaking/knight-boy-acquitted-halloween-triple-homicide](http://www.kentma.com/news/breaking/knight-boy-acquitted-halloween-triple-homicide)

*What?* I clicked the link before I read the email, but it was just a blurb, not even a full article, from six years ago.

>"The trial for the triple homicide of Kent High School students Ashley Briar, 18, Rose Thorpe, 17, and Matthew Ryan, 17, on the night of October 31st, 2012, comes to a screeching halt as Victor Knight, age 11, is acquitted for the crime after the defense presented screen shots and data logs proving that Knight was playing a video game online at the time the crime was committed. No other suspects have been brought forth at this time. More tonight at 8."

I sat back in my desk chair, dumbfounded. A triple homicide, seven years ago, less than a hundred miles away from where I was currently sitting, and an *eleven year old boy* was the primary suspect. How had I never heard about this? Seven years ago I was a freshman in college, taking my first journalism course at Anonymous University, even closer to Kent than where I lived now. I couldn’t believe we never talked about this case.

The article was frustratingly short and I was about to start furiously Googling when I remembered there was an actual email waiting for me. I went back to it.

At first I was sure it was from a kid, maybe a high schooler doing a school project who came across the story, but I realized a few lines in that this email wasn’t from a kid. It was from a cop. And not just any cop – it was from one of the responding officers to the initial 911 call that reported the bodies, Jerry O’Rourke.

>*This case broke me. I thought once the FBI took over, I could shake it and move on, but I never got those faces, that heinous crime scene, out of my head. I still take pills to sleep.*

It’s not often you hear a cop confess to being screwed up by a case, or by anything, actually. In his email, Jerry explained that he was forty-eight when the crime occurred, and planned to stay on the force until he was required to retire at age sixty-five. He liked being a police officer and felt that he was doing really good work for his community. Then this crime happened. He was writing to me on the night of his fifty-fifth birthday, when he became eligible for maximum pension benefits and immediately retired.

Jerry gave me a brief rundown of the case:

On November 1, 2013, an elderly lady living in the Brookside Hills neighborhood of Kent, Massachusetts, was walking her dog in the woods behind her house. She came across what she first thought was the leftovers of a Halloween prank, because of the way the bodies were posed and dressed, until she got close enough.

It was three students from the local high school: Ashley Briar, Rose Thorpe, and Matthew Ryan. All three were seniors and heavily involved in varsity football and cheerleading. It was, as Jerry said, a heinous crime scene, although it was even worse than I knew from that initial email.

Ashley and Rose were wearing their cheerleading uniforms, holding their pom-poms, arms stuck out in cheerleader-y ways. Matt was wearing his football jersey, pads, and helmet, and had a football tucked under one arm. All three of them bore evidence of brutal, fatal wounds to their heads, necks, and torsos.

Within a few weeks, an eleven-year-old boy was arrested for the murders. Jerry didn’t go into details about Victor Knight’s arrest, simply saying that they had a decent case against him. But when the case went to court, the defense turned up something that the police had missed, or not bothered to look for in the first place: Victor had an airtight alibi.

The night that the crime was committed, Victor was playing video games in his room. But he wasn’t just playing Xbox by himself: he was playing an online multiplayer game while video chatting with friends. The game generated a log which proved not only that Victor was logged in at the time of the murder, but that he was actively playing, meaning that he wasn’t logged in but actually off committing a triple homicide. Furthermore, his friends had multiple screen grabs of the video chat, showing Victor’s face with timestamps proving he was sitting at his desk playing a video game when the murders occurred.

So Victor was acquitted, and there were no other suspects. The case went cold.

In his email, Jerry explained that he was never satisfied with the way the investigation was handled. During the active investigation, he tried to do some digging on his own, but he was not a detective and the chief threatened his job if he didn’t give it up. But he never forgot about it, and as soon as he retired, he sent me an email. He had listened to the podcast, was impressed by my investigative journalism, and he wanted me to look into this case.

I ravaged the internet for any more information, but there was shockingly little. You would think that such a strange and gruesome case would garner national attention, but you’d be surprised by how many horrible murder cases go with very little media coverage. What was really strange to me was that there was almost nothing on the Kent, MA website, which seemed to be a pretty solid news source otherwise. How was this not all over the local news?

I leaned back in my chair and rubbed bleary eyes. It was almost three in the morning. I sent Jerry O’Rourke a response saying I’d be in town tomorrow, booked a hotel, and slept for a few hours before making the two hour drive to Kent. I was completely wired the whole way, partly from all the caffeine I’d consumed to make up for my sleepless night and partly because I was already obsessed with this case and determined to solve it.

I'm going to leave it there for now and see if there's any interest in me diving deeper into this. There's a lot about this case that doesn't make any sense, even more than I'm used to, so I'm looking for any out-of-the-box ideas on moving forward with my investigation. Let me know if you want to hear more.

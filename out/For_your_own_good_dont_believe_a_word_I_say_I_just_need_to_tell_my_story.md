I never fully understood why people were afraid of ghosts. I think now it's because the idea that there is a lesser version of life after this one scares people. The thought of being caught in a loop, repeating your death, or being trapped in a house or to an object, is almost too much to bear for some. So it’s less the fear of the ghost itself, and more the fear that someday, you might be caught in the same fate. 

People are afraid of places that are quiet and dark. The night tickles the imagination in unpleasant ways. An unexplained noise can make your heart thump a fraction faster for a moment. I believe it is that fear that lets them in. The more you fear the dark or the almost inaudible thud in the other room, the closer they get.  One moment of believing something sinister is nearby may allow something sinister to inch closer. Before you know it, you’re seeing shadowed figures behind every tree and you’re hearing the almost silent hum of Them. Before they slip their long thin fingers through my ears and into my mind, I have to tell my story. 

I’ve always liked the idea that something else exists. Something beyond our vision. Maybe ghosts or fairies or aliens. But I never truly believed such things could actually exist, I was simply flirting with them. One evening I was browsing the local library for a new book and I picked up Dracula by Brohm Stoker. I devoured it. I found the horror genre intoxicating and I wanted more and more of  it. So I started to read horror books with increasing hunger, I tore into them like werewolves tear flesh. I had a delicious fling with darkness on every page and I was loving it all. Eventually I started to see opportunities for horror in my day-to-day life. My neighbors house would be a perfect haunted house. The girl at the grocery store might secretly be a body snatcher. A casual day at the beach with friends had several horror-based outcomes. It was all good fun. My friends and I would joke about my dark mind and they would suggest new horror books and movies. 

My favorite ones were about possession. Losing control of your mind and body, being forced to surrender to some powerful dark being. I watched movie after movie in which the unfortunate victim gets twisted and bent into some unrecognizable shape while spewing words in languages they weren’t supposed to know. I never really made the connection that those who got possessed always seemed to have some fascination with the occult and darkness. Or the victim is very religious, raised believing in Satan and demons. It’s as if those of us with an interest in such things are more susceptible to them. Chloe thinks I have a fascination with horror because of the trauma I experienced surrounding my father's death. Well, she used to think that. I'm not sure she thinks much of me anymore.

i suppose i should tell you how it started. Have you ever heard of the ‘foot in the door’ phenomenon? It’s a term i learned in my psychology class in high school. it’s when you’re able to accept something larger because you first let something small in. Like when you convince your mom to let you stay out until ten only after she’s first allowed you to stay out until nine. My foot in the door was something so small, it was hardly something worth noting. I started believing that the wishes I made on pennies in the fountain at the local mall came true. It was really just a coincidence that I was put in the same sculpting class as Chloe. And the fact that my best friend accepted me for who i love was just because she’s a great person. Regardless, i really believed in those pennies. So I started to wonder what other little suspicions could be true. I thought my little beliefs were quirky and cute. I didn’t know they would be dangerous. 

Shortly after reading ‘real’ stories of hauntings I decided it would be fun to take some friends to an abandoned house with a dark past and spend the night. What else do you do in college on a saturday night? We snuck in and play-screamed at every little bump while giggling hysterically. nobody actually wanted to be scared. so i snuck off to the quiet side of the house hoping to experience some toe-curling spine-chilling taste of my favorite addiction. Part of me didn’t think anything would happen, but i think another part of me actually believed there could be something there. i think i wanted there to be something there. and then there was. just a silent hello, but a hello. i ran. Of course later I found out that it had just been my friend messing with me, but it was too late. I had genuinely believed I heard a ghost. and now the door was open.

It escalated quickly after that night. I started seeing things in reflections right behind me. It was faint, you had to be looking for it, but it was there. Something tall and shadowy and unnatural. I got into the habit of avoiding mirrors and other reflective surfaces because I knew I would see IT. I didn’t know that acting out of fear, feeding this new suspicion, would make things worse. My friends became concerned because my avoiding reflective surfaces had gotten so extreme that I would close my eyes when I drank water. When I opened my eyes I would imagine little creatures were swimming around in my glass. Once I was alone after having just finished a new horror novel when I decided to take a bravely large gulp of water. I was feeling foolishly empowered having conquered my fear of the creatures in the book. That’s when something wriggled into my mouth. It slipped under my tongue and burrowed into my gums. My glass shattered on the floor as I ran to the bathroom mirror prepared to see some kind of parasitic worm latched to my gum like a tick. There was nothing there. I stopped drinking water after that. 

Of course dehydration didn’t help with my paranoia. But I went on with my life because I didn’t want to freak out my friends or my new girlfriend Chloe. Towards the end of the school year I had to catch up on some pottery for my sculpture class so I stayed late in the studio. As it got dark out I played my favorite acoustic working music and got into my art. Determined to finish, I left my half-formed vase to turn the kiln on. When I turned back to my vase the wheel was already spinning and my vase was being shaped by slim invisible hands. I swallowed the nausea in my gut and went over to stop the wheel. Once I was within reaching distance the wheel and my music stopped suddenly. Everything went silent. A scream and pounding interrupted the eerie silence and I ran to the kiln thinking someone must have been in there. I must have been distracted and not noticed them. A hand pounded against the window of the large oven and the too familiar scent of burnt flesh jerked me into the memory of that night. For a moment I was paralyzed reliving that day, the car, the guilt, my father. When I snapped out of it I threw the door open to a cold, empty kiln full of freshly baked crosses. Yes, crosses. Hundreds of them. I left my vase and my tools on the wheel and I went home to the safety of Chloe, who would tell me I was just dehydrated and tired. 

And so it went on like this. Fear permeated every little mundane activity until Chloe got sick of it. My teachers lost patience with my late assignments. My friends transitioned from concern to apathy as I isolated myself to avoid scaring them. And so I sit alone in my dorm room, waiting to be the pin that drops in the hay. Unnoticed and unfindable. I pulled the cloth off all reflective surfaces, poured myself a glass of water, and accepted that They won. The creatures or hallucinations or whatever they are can have me now. I guess part of me has always known this is where I belong anyways. I sought it out afterall. Obsessed over it. And now it will consume me. Thank you to my friends and family and beautiful Chloe for trying. I only have one request: don’t believe a word of this.

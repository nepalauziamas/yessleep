This is a real story from a few years ago. I've modified bits to fit within the guidelines to post but this story is completely authentic. I was in disbelief at what I heard.

I'll give a little backstory. When this happened I was working in the insurance industry. A policyholder had called into the office and wanted me to make some changes to his policies. It was an easy task and the tone of the call was cordial. To make the changes he wanted I needed permission of the woman named on the policy, his ex-wife.

I called her, and asked her to sign a form to get these policies into this guy’s name. She said that was fine. They were his property so I sent her the form. She thanked me for being the middle man in this situation. Their divorce was messy and she doesn’t like dealing with the guy. I knew a little bit but not nearly as much as I would soon find out.

A few days later I received a call from this man again. Here is that call…with personal details removed.

**Him**: Hi, Sam. Do you remember us talking earlier about the changes to make to my policies?

**Me**: Yes, I sure do.

**Him**: No, not ‘yes’. Yes sir. Show some professionalism Sam.

*I was caught off guard by this. I asked myself "Is this is a battle I want to get into?"*

*No, it wasn't. Not this time. I knew this guy had a record, and has legitimately threatened to kill my boss in the past.*

**Me**: Sure, yes sir.

**Him**: So I’m curious Sam. What makes you think you need a woman’s permission to do something?

**Me**: I’m sorry, what do you mean?

**Him**: Did I not ask you to make changes X and Y to my policies?

**Me**: Yes, you did.

**Him**: Did I ask you to call a woman to ask for permission?

**Me**: Oh, I see. Remember when I said both of your names were on the policy? Like I said before, hers is first which means to move these policies over to you I need her to sign a form. It’s fine, she said the policies were yours and that she would fill the form out right away. We talked about this.

**Him**: That’s not what I asked you Sam. I asked you if I wanted a woman’s permission to make a change on my policies.

**Me**: Under company rules, as the first named insured it’s her policy. That form I gave her will make it so she signs the policy over to you.

**Him**: So even though I own X her name being first means she has control of the insurance?

**Me**: Under our company’s rules, yes. I don’t agree with it but that’s how it is. However, like I said the form will change that. It will be yours going forward.

*There was a long pause after this.*

**Him**: Are all men in Minnesota pussies?

**Me**: What?

**Him**: I’m just asking if all Minnesota men are pussies. I don’t understand why you would go ask a woman for permission to do anything. Honestly, I don’t understand it. Explain it to me. You have men wearing dresses and wearing heels at the mall now and then you have men asking women for permission to do their jobs. I don’t get it Sam.

Women are evil. They are vile creatures. They’ve been taking all the power away from men for decades now. Ever since they were liberated they have been taking more and more power away from the men. They are now the dominant sex. We need to get back to the ways things were in the 50s when men were the dominant members of society. Everyone knew their place back then.

I think this all started when they made strangulation a felony. You know that used to be a gross misdemeanor? Ridiculous that it changed. Now all it takes is one exaggerated story and the next thing you know you are on trial for felony domestic assault. You know what I mean?

*This was a particularly long and unsettling rant. These are the general details I can remember but in reality it was probably three times as long of more equally disturbing content and claims. Finally, after not saying anything for the entirety of his rant, I responded.*

**Me**: I’m not sure what this has to do with me.

**Him**: It has everything to do with you Sam. By the way have I told you this call is being monitored and recorded?

**Me**: Okay.

**Him**: I document everything. You get falsely accused once and it changes your life. You get locked up. Then you prove she’s full of shit and get the sentence thrown out. Yet people think you're weird for installing secret cameras in your house and spying on your wife for two years. Well guess what, I’m not letting that happen again.

My lawyers and I are going out and making waves. We are changing things and making sure everything gets better again. The courts in Minnesota have it out for men. We’re going to change that.

**Me**: Okay.

**Him**: So what did I ask you to do Sam? I asked you two things. What were they?

**Me**: You wanted me to do X and you wanted me to do Y.

**Him**: No! I wanted you to do X and I wanted you to do Y!

**Me**: That’s what I did. Then I followed the procedure mandated by the company to make sure you will own the policies going forward.

**Him**: I’m going to need documentation of this. I don’t care if you have to stay late I need these documents sent to me today.

**Me**: No problem. Give me a minute and I’ll have them over to you here in a sec. Sent.

**Him**: Now back to this situation. My lawyer and I, we're going to make things right again. Sam, I don't know you but I know the man you work for. I only have one thing to say. You're either with us or against us. I can't wait to find out which side you take.

*Then he hung up.*

I am scared.

I am confused even.

My hands are trembling as I write this story, but it is important that people know what's going on. 

The crying is getting louder, less distant now. My life was doomed the second I stepped foot into the Coconino Forests. If you live in Arizona and especially near the Coconino National Forest, PLEASE LISTEN TO ME and for the love of god, if you hear a distant crying coming from the forest, IGNORE IT.

Let me start from the very beginning, or should I say, the first mistake. I formerly lived in New York as I was attending university there. After graduating, I had gotten a job as an accountant for a private bank. To be honest, it was a waste of my talent and the four years I had spent earning a degree from university. But, I had no choice but to take it. Mainly because the pay was decent and I had student loans to repay. So, after taking the job and training under them for 6 months, I was to move to Arizona and join their Arizona branch to start working. It wasn't very difficult for me to move, primarily because my parents were back in Minnesota. All in all, I was on my own.

After I moved to Arizona, I lived in a cheap dusty motel and started looking for a place to rent. I still had about a week to get my affairs straight before joining and from the day I finished my training to moving to Arizona, I had already burned about 4 days. Now I had less than 3 days to find a place to live. 

I found a decent place with cheap rent near a trailer park just outside the Coconino National Forest, which is very famous in Arizona, as the locals have told me. It is also locally infamous for the number of people who have disappeared while hiking in the Coconino Forests. Judging by the crying that is getting closer every second I spend writing this document, I think I know the reason for their vanishing.

After settling into my new home, life went on as usual. The daily routine was simply to wake up, go to work, come home, watch some TV with a cold beer and go to bed, doing it all over again the next day.

It was just like a typical night when the unfortunate fate of my life was sealed. I cracked open a cold one and turned on the TV and was a watching a Seinfield rerun when I heard a very faint sound. Now, the trailer park was about 2 miles opposite to my house so I ignored the sound, thinking it was coming from the people living in the trailer park. The crying has changed into screeching and I can now hear faint tapping coming from downstairs. I have locked myself in my room. Now I realize that maybe I should have ignored that sound that day.

As the night became quieter, the sound became more clearer. I could now make out that the sound was of a women crying. I had not taken a sip of my beer till that point, so me hallucinating this out of a drunken haze was clearly out of the question.

I was really concerned, but at the same time, really questioning my next step. It was almost midnight at this point and I had a mental conflict of either calling the police or going to investigate myself. I decided to atleast see what was going on before calling the police.

The tapping has turned into violent bangs, screeching has intensified to the point where I can't hear my thoughts

I picked up my flashlight and went out into the outskirts of the forest. Seeing that it was almost 1am now and for the fear of any wild animals, I made it a point to not go near or too deep into the forest.

Flashing the flash light around I picked up a very strange object which was lying near the door of my backyard. Upon picking it up, I saw that it was a small box. Alarm bells were already going off in my head. But, as is human nature, I rationalized it thinking it was something I had missed while moving into this new house.

She has broken in as I heard the sound of the door breaking. The screeching and banging have stopped entirely. It is just silence. I can now see how disturbing pin-drop silence can be

As I opened the box, I saw a small silver coin in it. Upon feeling it I felt an engraving on it, as if something was written on it. I went back into my house to get a better look. I didn't realize it back the, dismissing it for a prank, but it was actually my death sentence. It was my doomed fate.

The head portion of the coin had "UR" engraved on to it, with the tail portion having "NEXT" engraved on to it. It wasn't long before I put two and two together and made out the sentence.

"YOU ARE NEXT"

My blood ran cold. This has to be a sick joke. This is a silly prank.

I can now hear her breathing and the creaks of her coming upstairs. I don't have much time left.

The moment I made out the sentence, I heard a women's crying. This time, dangerously close.

I dropped the coin and looked around. I couldn't find anyone and anything, but the sound persisted. 

Now my heart was racing and that anxiety growing.

Then I saw her. The hideous face of a woman, with dark red eyes and overflowing black hair, just breathing down near my backyard door's window. 

I don't know how my brain reacted as the next thing I know, I was in my bedroom with the door locked. The crying continued and with this we come to the present moment.

She just knocked on my door, her breathing sound making it difficult to continue writing this supposed last will.

I am scared

I am confused even

The coin, the woman breathing outside my door, everything has started to become a big blur

Then I hear her speak

"THE COIN NEVER LIES AND IT CHOSE YOU"

"YOU ARE NEXT"

Just when she said these harrowing words, I hear a coin clip and the wooden door shatter into splinters and through the gap I see her deathly gaze, confirmation that I am about to meet my maker soon.

If anyone finds this document, then please mark my words

Stay away from Coconino National Forest

If you hear a woman's cries coming from the Coconino Forest

PLEASE IGNORE IT

If I don't update on my situation in the near future, you all know what happened to me

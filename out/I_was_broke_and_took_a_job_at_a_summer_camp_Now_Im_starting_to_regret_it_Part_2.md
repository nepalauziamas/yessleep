If you managed to miss my first cry for help, here it is. 

[Part 1 Here]

It's been hours since I was in that horrible situation, so I'll fill you in. 

I was hiding in the bush, as you all probably know.
I waited for a few hours as the sun started to rise. The bear and that..that creature was still patrolling the area. 
I don't even know how fast I ran out of that bush when I saw the sun start to rise. I shouted for Jericho loudly as I tried to get back to the campsite. The creature let out an ear-piercing screech as it chased me, while the bear followed shortly after. 

"JERICHOOOOO" I screamed and cried out for Jericho as I was soon approaching the campsite with sprained. ankle from falling into the bushes. As the sun shone through the trees, I heard the creature start screeching louder, hearing it's skin sizzling as it was burning away. 

The bear dashed forward as I rolled out of the way, hearing it roar loudly as it presumably fell on one of the fallen trees as it scurried away. I saw the campsite further up ahead as I thought I'd lost the creature as it let out one final screech and I stopped hearing footsteps.

"JERICHO!" 

I saw Jericho in front of the cabin through the tears in my eyes as he started running towards me. Before I collapsed, I heard Jericho say something.

"Behind you."

I rolled and turned around, seeing the creature floating above me. I watched as a fire axe hit it in the skull, forcing out a loud screech. I could feel my ears bleeding. 
I heard yelling as one of the cabin doors open and a boy suddenly appeared in front of me in the air, with a sledgehammer. I watched as he slammed down on the fire axe with the sledgehammer, shoving it further into the skull, cutting it in half. The sledgehammer dropped to the ground as the creature fell to the ground and started turning to ash. Everything started to fade to black as I passed out. 

"Hello? Wake up. Are you alive?"

I opened my eyes to see Jericho and someone else standing over me. "Wha- What happened?" I felt my cheek burning as Jericho slapped me. 

"Asshole. Thanks for breaking Rule #5. Also, thanks for not locking the door. I had to fight off those bears for hours, man. HOURS!"

I sat up, and saw I was in a different cabin. A man in a doctor's clothing was typing on a computer. 

"W-Where am I?"

Jericho backed up and responded.

"The infirmary. You passed out due to the pain of spraining your ankle."

The boy next to him responded.

"Jericho, calm down. I'm sure he didn't have anything around him that could kill a bird. That or his aim just sucks."

Jericho walked out of the infirmary while the doctor turned to the boy. The boy had brown hair fading into a light blue at the ends. He was wearing a baseball cap and a shirt that read, "Cabin Adventure". 

Cabin Adventure is the cabin across from Cabin Quest, so I assumed he's the "Jericho" of that cabin.
He sat in a chair next to my bed.

"Heya! My name's Nicholas, Nich for short. Sorry for Jericho's behavior earlier, he's quite pissed off that I had to pitch in because you got chased by one of the doves."

I was confused. He was the one that saved me with a sledgehammer? The doves turned into..whatever the hell that was? No wonder we were to kill them immediately. 

"But-" I was cut off immediately by the sound of screaming as the sky suddenly turned a jet black and Jericho ran inside the infirmary. Nich's face suddenly turned pale and panicked as he got up.

"Are the campers in their cabins? What time is it Jericho? What happened?"

Jericho crossed his arms and leaned on one of the wooden walls of the cabin as the doctor suddenly hid.

"Time sped up. Its around 12:45. Around an hour or two past the time to lock the doors. And since the infirmary doesn't have a door, we'll have to defend this cabin wiht this douche inside. Out of my time here, never would i have expected unnatural events and entities to appear here!"

I suddenly spoke up. "What?! What's going to happen to the kids in my cabin? They're going to die! They don't know about the rules and-"

"Calm down, the kids in Cabin Quest and Cabin Adventure have been transferred to Cabin Safewall, They're completely safe from anything there. The counselor from Cabin Adventure is also there, prepared with a few survival items." Jericho seemed to stay calm throughout all of this.

Suddenly, we were surrouned by these strange entities. They all were missing their heads, their limbs twisted and contorted in different directions, floating yet chained to the ground.

"FUCK!" Jericho shouted as Nicholas pulled out a sword from nowhere. Jericho and Nich backed up as they approached me. I started crying out of shock, wondering if they were going to leave me to die.
The entities approached me, looming over my bed as everything started to get darker and darker. I could feel my skin starting to melt and peel off in different areas. They let out these loud sounds. If you could even call them sounds. These were unlike anything I've ever heard before. It was like I was hearing chains scraping against something, and loud, distorted, breathing at the same time. I felt chains wrap around my neck, choking me. I looked around frantically, looking for Jericho and Nich.

"DIE MOTHERFUCKERS!"

Jericho had sent them flying, his face scratched and bloodied. Nicholas had one eye closed, a claw mark on the left side of his face.

"Good to know these chained bodies went after us first. Jeez.." Jericho grabbed one of them and had a tight grip around it's neck, effectively choking it.
Nich had sliced one of their stomachs as one went for me, seeing me as an easy target.

"Are you ready Jericho?" Nich asked as he gripped his sword tightly.

"I was born to be." They both let out a battle cry as Jericho took them down with brute force, Nich finishing the job as he stabbed them in the stomach.

One was left, yet it looked the worst of them all. It looked the same as the others, chained up, mutilated, and headless. Yet it had blisters that oozed this disgusting pus, and rotten liquid spilled out from it's neck. Chains wrapped up Nicholas as it held out it's arm towards Jericho and lifted it up, forcing Jericho into the air. It closed it's fist, and Jericho started coughing as if he was being choked. 

Jericho looked more pissed off than scared, his body up in the air, him being choked.  He started to speak.

"Telekinesis. Great. So not only do these invade your mind, they have telekinetic abilities." 

Nicholas was passed out, probably due to fatigue.
Jericho had this fierce murderous look in his eyes as he screamed loudly, sending it flying out the door. Pens and other sharp items started to float, suddenly shooting at the entity. It let out a loud screech and i got out of bed, limping and running before falling into a ditch, hitting my head on a rock.

I'm currently still in this ditch, hoping that nothing finds me. I hear loud screeching and crying, and its getting closer. It's so dark and I feel like crying. I miss my family. I hope they'll stay positive, even if i die here at this strange camp. Im falling in and oith of consciousness. I can barely read what im typng. I hope i live. I'll keep you all updated ehen i can.

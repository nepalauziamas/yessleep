I hobbled over to the hooded teenager laying face down in the dewy grass. I moved as quietly as I could under the circumstances…because if the kid sprang to his feet and charged me, I was in no condition to run. 

As I got closer to the eerie red glow of the phone beside him, I understood what Sammy had meant. The air near the kid’s phone seemed to hum with some kind of electricity, and I felt a kind of…*pressure*…in the back of my mind.

Like something was trying to push its way through. 

Puke rose in my throat. My knees felt weak. 

I put all my weight on my good leg, lifted my cane high above my shoulder–

And hole-in-one’d that damn phone as far away as I could whack it. 

That sickening feeling vanished immediately. Nervously, I bent down beside the teenager: a brown-haired boy with glasses, probably around fourteen.

His breathing was regular. He seemed to be asleep–

But he was *definitely* one of the Silent Kids. I could tell by the scrapes and bruises on his hands and arms, the mud on his cargo pants. His skin was sallow and stretched from lack of sleep and nourishment…but that awful slack-jawed look had gone out of his face.

Around the corner of the house, I saw a bare foot and a girl’s black shoe. 

It was another silent kid, a girl of about thirteen wearing a skirt and a jean jacket. She leaned against the fence like a puppet with its strings cut…like she’d fallen asleep trying to climb it. 

One of her hands was covered in blood…but I doubted it was hers.

It was all very strange, but now that I knew these two (and maybe more) were near, I’d have to keep my guard up. Walking back to the car, I touched the cold steel of the revolver in my pocket and wished I had the strength to follow Sammy and Cayden.

*WHAPWAHPWHAPWAHPWHAPWAHP*

A horrible wind came roaring from the woods. Instinct made me duck, but my damn leg gave out and I wound up prone on the pavement beside Sammy’s sedan. With no place else to hide, I crawled into the oily darkness beneath it. 

The noise was so loud I couldn’t even hear Monster’s barks. Only after it passed over the car did I realize what it was: a jet-black helicopter, flying low. Two more followed it. 

Finally, the noise passed. I was just about to drag myself out from underneath the car when I heard Monster stand up and start scratching at the glass of the passenger side window–

The one that faced the trail.

*Something was coming out of the forest.* 

I kept still with my chest on the asphalt, listening to my heartbeat and gritting my teeth at the pain in my leg. 

The two figures in night-camouflage kevlar that came down the path looked military, but not from any outfit that I’d ever heard of. The pattern of their gear, the insignia–it was all wrong. 

To my horror, they approached the car.

Soon, all I could see were their brutal-looking black boots. 

“Lookit this,” one grunted. “The owner probably went for a walk back when all this started and never came back. *They* probably got’em before he knew what hit’em. Poor bastard.”

A rifle butt shattered Sammy’s car window. Broken glass rained down, the door opened, and Monster hopped out, tail wagging. I silently prayed that they wouldn’t hurt him, and that he wouldn’t do anything to alert these two weird paramilitary thugs to my presence–

But I shouldn’t have worried. Monster was way too curious about the whole new world of smells on their gear to give a damn about *me.* 

“Whosa good boy?!” A husky female voice chuckled, petting Monster. “Makes me glad that the higher-ups only ordered to neutralize civilians on this operation. I hate when we gotta kill every living thing just to keep some godawful menace from spreading.”

“Yeah,” the male agreed. “That scorched-earth shit always leaves me feeling sick to my stomach. I just tell myself that if the civvies knew what *we* know, they’d probably consider death a blessing…and *that’s* considering that the the higher-ups make us forget the *really* fucked-up suff1” He paused. “But this was a bad one. They’re sure they got it all?” 

“Christ, Barker!” I could *hear* the woman rolling her eyes. “How many times do I gotta explain it to you?! Those things are *four-dimensional beings.* They exist both beneath the surface of our world and…*elsewhere.* Fragging one here ain’t any different from pullin’ up half of a weed or cuttin’ the tail off a lizard…it’ll just grow back someplace else, and start doing the same shit, taking over minds so that it can feed.” 

“What’re they gonna tell the civilians?” 

“About the disappearances, you mean? Nothin. In this country, if it doesn’t get reported on, it might as well have never happened. And as for our operation, the higher-ups have got all the civvies holed up in their houses. They told’em there was a bad chemical spill and it wasn’t safe to go outside. Pretty lame excuse if you ask me, but it did the job. Later they’ll probably put some amnesics in the water supply, and as for the kids–well, that’s a bright spot in all this mess. *They* won’t remember anything. They’ll wake up sore and with a weird feeling of missing time, but other than that…”

“Christ.” The man sighed. “*I* have a teenage son. I’d hate to think…”

“Well, like I said. That *thing* we fragged in the cave could worm its way back at any time…and anybody under twenty or so can have their brain scrambled by its frequencies. Here, boy!” Throughout the whole blood-chilling conversation, the woman had been playing fetch with Monster. “Whaddya think we oughta do with the pup?”

“Well, we can’t take him with us.” The man shrugged as he turned to go. “But look at this rich-ass neighborhood. Once the civvies get the go-ahead to come outta their houses and somebody sees this golden boy playing in their yard, he’ll get adopted faster than you can say ‘*Nyarlathotep.’* You gotta dog, Simmons?”

“I did when I was a kid. Now *that* brings back memories. Ugh. I shoulda stayed in my hometown and been a mechanic like my old man…” 

Their boots crunched in the glass as they walked off, but their words kept ringing in my ears for a *long* time. 

*‘Neutralize…’*

What the hell did that mean? What would these weird troopers doing to the *‘civvies’* like me, or Sammy, or Cayden–if they caught us outside?

Would they inject us with some drug to make us forget? Haul us off to some unofficial prison with black bags over our heads? Or would they just shoot us on sight? 

It was an important question…*because those two black-booted soldiers had come from from the same path that Cayden and Sammy had taken.* 

I lay my cheek against the cool asphalt. It smelt like tar, dirt, and being alive. 

A week ago I never would’ve imagined myself like this: hungry, exhausted, barely able to walk. Facedown beneath Sammy’s car, only a few blocks away from my own house. 

There was no point in moving now, not with those paramilitary goons on the loose. I reckoned I might as well get a bit of shuteye…

*TWISSSS–THWIP-THWIP-THWIP-THWIP! TWISSSSSS–*

*Was that a…sprinkler system?*

From where I lay beneath Sam’s car, I could see a man in a bathrobe and pajamas sniffing the air nervously before walking to the end of his driveway to collect his newspaper. 

Leaning forward a little more, I caught a glimpse of a young couple pushing their toddler down the sidewalk in a stroller that probably cost more than my first car. 

The sky was light blue. The sun was in the east.

I’d slept for over twenty-four hours. 

After limping over to take a leak behind the cover of the trees, I turned back to the bizarre sight of my neighborhood–

Bizarre, because it was completely normal. 

No young folks hunted in packs or lay face down in anyone’s grass. 

People were starting up their cars, taking out their garbage, and mowing their lawns like none of what Cayden, Sammy, and I had endured had ever happened. 

“Howdy neighbor!” Trevor Boden, a guy my own age who talked my ear off every time I saw him on one of my walks, waved cheerfully to me. *He was trimming his damn rose bushes.* “Helluva scare yesterday, huh? I *never* expected something like that would happen in *my* neighborhood. ‘Course, ever since that new mayor took over this town’s gone straight to hell…” he rambled on. My aching head only caught the keywords: *a dangerous chemical spill on the highway. A cloud of dangerous gas. Important to cover all doors and windows. Especially dangerous for young people. Toxins that may cause muscle soreness and affect memory…*

It finally hit me. What I was hearing was the story that they’d all been told to keep them inside while those black-armored troops got down to business in the woods behind the neighborhood. Whoever was behind this not only had access to military-grade tech, but they’d *also* convinced the media to report completely false information.

It was a lot to take in. 

“Trevor…” I finally cut in, “This is sorta embarrassing, but…I was out for a walk and I hurt my leg. Reckon you could give me a ride back to my place? It’s only a few blocks down…” 

Six minutes later, I was waving goodbye to Trevor from my own front porch. He was still talking when he drove off. 

It felt like a lifetime since I’d been inside my own house. 

I called Sammy, then Austin again. No answer. I looked up Cayden’s parents’ phone number, but on the fifth ring I realized that anything I said would sound suspicious as well. I wondered what Monster was up to.

With nothing better to do, I got a cold beer from the fridge, limped over to my recliner, put on another black-and-white war movie–

And waited. 

*Ding-dong. Dingdong! Dingdongdingdongdingdong!*

It came late at night, just like before. I grabbed my revolver and hobbled to the door.

Peering through the peephole, I how many hooded figures I’d see on my stoop, how long it would be before they smashed in through the windows–

When I saw who was on the porch, I opened the door so fast I damn near fell over.

Monster came bounding in, shedding golden hair everywhere–

And Sammy and Cayden were behind him. 

“You’re alright!” Sammy hugged me. 

“What *happened* to you two?”

“We were about halfway down the trail when we heard voices. Two people talking into their radios.” Cayden explained. “They looked like…I dunno, like soldiers from the future. Me and Sammy got off the trail and hid in a ravine while they passed.”

“They looked like bad news.” Sammy added. “We were worried about you, all alone back there…and when we came out of the woods and saw the window broken and you gone, we didn’t know what to think…”

“The area around the cave was sealed off.” Cayden went on. “There were guys in hazmat suits, searchlights, plastic tents…it was like a scene from a movie. We got out of there as fast as we could. And then, when we came back…”

“It was like none of it had happened at all.” I finished for him. “See, I reckon that at first, people didn’t *want* to believe that the Silent Kids were real. Later, they were *afraid* to admit the truth. And now…they’ve *forgotten* all about it. Maybe it’s easier for’em that way.”

I looked from Sammy, to Cayden, to Monster. 

Only a few days ago, we’d been strangers, but now–for the first time in a long time–I was standing side by side with *friends.*  Whatever dangers might come to our town from now on, I knew we’d face them together.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wlqsvv/i_just_found_out_i_have_a_brother_that_my_parents/) 

Ever since I went to the sheriff my parents have been acting really weird, which is saying a lot for them, because they are bat shit crazy at the best of times, they won't let me go anywhere unless one of them is with me. Even at home they are around me all the time, I can’t even make a piss without one of them questioning me, and I am pretty sure they have a camera in my room because every time I put one foot outside my room door someone is standing there. They treat me like a kindergartener now, helping me with the smallest of tasks like tying my shoes or cutting my food in to small pieces.  

That’s not all, they give me praise for every little thing, my dad keeps calling me champ I am not sure why, he never did that when I was little. It's embarrassing especially when he does it in public. I was in the store one day buying a soda, when the guy behind the counter accidentally knocked it over and it fell, but I caught it before it hit the floor. My dad shouted, “well done champ” and started clapping, there was a drunk guy standing behind him and he joined in and started cheering. On the way out I noticed a group of girls from my school were looking at me smirking, I was so embarrassed, to make it worse I really like this one girl Tracy, she must think I am an idiot now. 

I don't know why they were fucking with me like that, but I am guessing it was just another one of their mind games. They are probably trying to forget about my brother and hope I will do the same. I won’t let them, I talk about him every chance I get, but they keep changing the subject and try to bribe me with whatever I want. I am not ashamed to say, I take full advantage. It's like this, if I am going to be locked away from the rest of the world, I might as well make the most of it while I can. They bought me a brand-new PlayStation with all the trimmings, VR headset, games, everything I could ever ask for. I am sick of playing their little games and acting like one big happy family. 

They thought they could separate us by hiding him away where I couldn’t find him. It didn’t work because one night I woke up to the sound of my brother's voice in my ear, instantly I jumped up and turned on the light, but I couldn’t see him anywhere. I was on my way back to bed when I heard, “Josh.”  

I thought he was back in the attic, so I stood in the bed and whispered, “I am sorry for calling the cops, I should have listened to you, I promise I will break you out of there this time.” 

“It's ok” he replied, “every day I feel myself get stronger and stronger, thanks to you, they know it, that’s why they are trying to keep us apart.” I nearly cried, I was so happy to be able to talk to him again, I thought he was dead. He continued, “one way or another I will get out of here, and when I do, they will pay, everyone will pay.”  

We spoke a lot after that, and I realized we had a lot in common. We both love to read and liked many of the same books, I imagine, he hadn't much else to do up there, and my parents probably gave him the books when I was done with them. He even kept a journal; in fact, so did our whole family, my mom gave me a habit of writing in mine before bed every night as far back as I can remember, she even made my dad keep one. I write everything in mine, even my darkest thoughts, one of my biggest fears is, my parents finding it, I know they would never understand. 

I think our connection is getting stronger, he started showing me things in my head, like him getting dragged out of bed in the middle of the night and brought to the attic. Maybe that’s why I kept having that recurring nightmare as a child, he was trying to ask me for help, I feel so bad now, but i thought it was only a dream. What my dad did to him up there is wrong. I hated my parents, especially my dad. I wanted to know everything but my brother said I wasn’t ready yet. 

I had so many visions, some were so horrible I can’t bare thinking how could anyone hurt people like that. Even though every vision was different and I didn’t recognise anyone, they all had one thing in common, the eyes I was seeing through were pure evil, I could feel the hate and anger pumping through its veins. Then again maybe it was all a dream, I don’t know any more. But whatever they were, they started to take over my life, and I sometimes forgot what was real, and for a moment it was like I was a different person, well person is the wrong word to describe it.  

My brother said it was hallucinations brought on by the drugs they gave me, he said they will all stop once we get rid of my parents. But I am not so sure he is telling the truth, I can hear my brothers voice all the time now, and not just in my room, I think he is in my head, I don’t mind at least I am not alone with them anymore, and I have someone on my side. 

I hated being around my parents, all I wanted to do was be alone in my room, but they wouldn’t let me, they forced me to go on their, *family* days out, it was torture. I always had to be on my toes and act like everything was ok, but it wasn’t, all I could think about was freeing my brother, he made sure of that, with his constant whispering inside my head. One day it got too much for me, we had just come home from a day at the waterpark, and instead of letting me go to my room like I wanted. My dad forced me to have one of his game's nights, I couldn’t take one more minute of monopoly with them monsters.  

So, when it was my turn to roll the dice, I must have lost it, and I blacked out. I didn’t think I did anything wrong because I was still sitting there in that same spot with the dice in my hand. But when I looked around everything in our sitting room was broken, tv, table, even our family photos. My parents were pushed up against the wall, and they looked terrified, it was so weird to see my dad like that he was shaking and everything. I thought he was going to kill me, but he didn’t budge from that wall, instead my mom walked over to me smiled grabbed my hand and took me to my room. 

When I got there, my mom gave me a big hug and whispered in my ear, “please! just ignore him, and try to be positive, it’s the only way to stop him, I can’t lose you again.” before walking away sobbing to herself. 

After that they barely let me out of my room, and when they did it was only for a short time, I think it was because of my dad, he couldn’t look me in the eye anymore. I think he somehow blamed my mom too; I could hear them arguing all the time, I was sure it would be only a matter of time before he left. But my brother wasn’t happy about that. He didn’t want him to leave before he got his revenge, I don’t think he felt the same about mom, he often shared happy memories of her. Unlike him I hated both of them, if she cared so much, she could have done something to stop him anytime she wanted to, but she didn’t. 

Soon the visions became more frequent, and he showed me the full extent of my dads cruelty. When my dad took him to the attic, he used to tie him to a chair and wouldn’t even take him out of the sack, it was torture. When my brother felt searing pain on his left arm everything became blurry and the music started, it was so surreal. It kind of sounded like something I heard as a child on some kids show that I can’t remember. Whenever he heard dads voice repeating, “you are Josh, you are happy, all your bad thoughts are gone,” Things became hazy, the next thing he knew he is in bed and it’s the next morning. 

He thought it was a dream at first, until one day, the bag got caught on a nail as dad carried him up the steps to the attic. When my brother realized what was happening, he managed to fight dad off, and escape out the door, somehow breaking dads' arm in the process, but when he saw mom standing at the bottom of the stairs crying, he froze for a second. Then dad grabbed him and held him down while mom injected him.  

My parents told him they had no choice but to keep him up there, until he stopped hurting people, which is sick, it was dads' own fault he got hurt that night, my brother was only defending himself. Besides, how could a child that young be capable of hurting anyone. I suppose whatever cult they were part of brain washed them, and they tried to do the same thing to my brother, I fear soon I will be next. 

After he knew what they were up to, the *treatment* as they called it, became very traumatic for him so he started to block it out by thinking of his happy place, which was him cuddled in the bed with mom or dancing around the kitchen with her. Eventually he got lost, and has been trapped in darkness ever since waiting for his chance to escape. I am so happy he made contact with me that night or I would never have known he existed. 

I still have no idea how he will get out of there, but he assures me it won’t be long, I can’t wait, I always felt like there was something missing in my life and now I know why. I wish I could make my parents pay right now for taking him away from me, but I haven’t got the courage to do it on my own.  

Lately I feel like I’m losing my mind, one minute I could be sitting on my bed playing the PS, the next minute I could be standing in the kitchen talking to my parents. The weird thing is they look so happy, laughing and joking with me like there is nothing wrong, when I check the time hours have passed. I don’t understand how I could be so friendly with them; I can’t face looking at them usually. 

I don’t know what I would do without my brother, he is the only one I can depend on, he always knows exactly what to say to calm me down when I freak out. Which is a lot lately since I started sleep walking, at first I would just wake up in the back yard covered in dirt, but now I started waking up in my parent's room, standing over my mom. I am so scared, I really hope my brother comes to save me, he promised he would, I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.

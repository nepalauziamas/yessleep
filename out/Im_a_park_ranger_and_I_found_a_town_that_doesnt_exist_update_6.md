I stood in front of her, my hands balled into fists at my sides. I looked into Irene's eyes as she glared back at me with pure hatred in her own.

"Do you really think you stand a chance against me? I am the strongest being you will ever have to face. You are nothing compared to what I can do!" She yelled, her voice filled with venom.

"Watch me," I responded.

I took several steps back and leaned forwards, letting the muscles in my legs tense up. My shoulders tightened, and I could feel my back arch. I let out another primal roar as I prepared to pounce.

Irene smirked. Her eyes sparkling in the light of the burning fires.

"Go ahead, you'll never touch me, Watcher.” She taunted. “You’re far too-“

I didn't give her the time to finish. I sprang forward, slamming into Irene and knocking us both to the ground. I felt her claws rip through my jacket as we fell, but I didn't care. I wanted to tear her apart.

We rolled over and over, punching and clawing at each other. I tried to use my enhanced strength to pin her down, but she was too quick and dexterous. I managed to hit her in the stomach, but she simply grabbed my arm and threw me across the campground.

I slammed into the side of an RV which sent it rolling. The impact knocked all the wind out of me and left me stunned for a moment. I lay there in pain, unable to move while Irene walked over to me.

"You should have stayed in your cabin, you pathetic little Watcher!" She screamed.

I rolled onto my back and wiped the blood from my mouth as I watched her approach.

"I'm going to enjoy ripping you apart." She said.

"Not if I can help it." I growled.

I rose to my knees and let out a defiant roar.

"I'm going to end you, Irene.” I said.

She laughed.

“Do you know how many Watchers before you thought that?” She taunted.

"Maybe I'll be the first to actually do it." I said.

"Won't be the last. I've been killing Watchers since before you were born. And I'll continue to kill them until my power is absolute." She said.

"Not today." I promised.

I didn't have to wait very long to test my words. Irene charged at me, and with one fluid motion, I grabbed her by the neck and flung her to my right. She smashed into a picnic table. The force of the impact knocked the entire thing over, spilling food and drinks everywhere.

Irene let out a scream of anger and frustration as she scrambled to her feet. She picked up the picnic table and threw it at me. I used my enhanced strength to leap out of the way, but the table splintered and cracked against the side of an RV. I turned to see Irene charging at me again. I sidestepped her attack and punched her in the stomach. She grunted and doubled over, falling to her knees. I kicked her in the face, sending her crashing backward.

Irene got to her feet and charged at me once more, swinging the broken remains of the picnic table around like a weapon. I ducked under it and kicked her in the chest, slamming her back into a tree. She fell to the ground, gasping for breath.

Irene struggled to get to her feet.

"You won't kill me. You'll never be able to kill me!" She said. I could tell she really was starting to doubt that.

"You're wrong. We both know I can." I said.

Irene finally was able to stand up. She brought the broken remains of the picnic table around like a shield.

"Come on then, Watcher. Let's finish this!” 

I lunged forward, my hands outstretched. I slammed them into the wooden railing of the picnic table, shattering it and knocking Irene to the ground. I grabbed her by the throat and lifted her up off the ground.

You will pay for everything you've done. Every life you took.” I growled.

“You’ll never kill us all!” She spat in my face. “More of you humans join us everyday!” She began laughing.

I gripped her head and twisted hard. Her neck snapped like a twig and the red light faded from her eyes. I turned to look at the chaos that was taking place in the campground behind me. I let out a primal, earth shaking roar and tore into the last of Irene’s group.

My rage was so powerful that the ground shook and trees toppled. The sound of metal screaming in protest echoed throughout the night as I fought. It was beautiful.

I lost track of time as I killed each and every one of them, leaving no survivors. They had made their choice, and now they would suffer the consequences.

 The carnage was horrible, and I hadn't even reached Hungry Horse yet. I tore the last of the group apart as I reached the town, and as I did, the sun finally started to rise. And the residents of Irene’s town were already up and about.

They were in for a surprise.

I started at the diner, tearing the door off the hinges and slaughtering every last resident inside.

I stormed through town, destroying anything that got in my way. I moved quickly and efficiently, tearing through a row of houses, smashing through walls and breaking furniture.

The citizens were panicked. They were running everywhere, trying to escape, only to find themselves trapped in the middle of my rampage. I heard the screams and cries of terror as I destroyed the town, and soon it was done. I had slaughtered everyone who lived there, and I was left standing in the center of a pile of dead bodies.

It was over. Irene had failed. The people of her town were gone. I grinned and called Dr. Oxblood. He would definitely enjoy hearing about this.

Good job, Samuel. I heard it was quite the show. I wish I'd been there to witness it." Oxblood said.
"It was incredible. I don't think I'll ever forget it." I replied.
"Excellent work, Samuel. Your work here is done. “Go home and take some time to rest. There will be more blood to spill soon enough, these towns aren’t the only weird thing about national parks." Oxblood said.

"Understood." I said.

"I'll contact you when I need you again.” Oxblood added.

I hung up the phone and closed my eyes.
What was next? I couldn't wait to find out.

I’ll let you guys know when I encounter other anomalies. Thanks for all
the advice!

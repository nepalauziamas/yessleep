It was the first time me and Nicole fought. We have been  best friends for the past 10 years. We never had arguments,we were inseparable, we shared absolutely everything, our moms were best friends, we lived literally next to each other. How could this happen? I don't know.

Well since we started high school Nicole started acting weird if I can call it that, it's not like she acted possest it's just that she always was so irritated , she always compared herself to me ,to others, she started waring make up, started crushing on boys much older than us, styling her clothes and seeing literally and other girl as competition. She got irritated at every little thing I did and when I talked back and told her that she wasn't acting like herself she would ignore me for a week and then show up to my house with little gifts and an apology. After everything would go back to normal, she would be nice for 2 days and then would become the bitch she was again. 


The third time it happened I was done with her bitchiness, she could come back to me when she new how to act with people. I thought she would apologize but what she did? She got together with my bully. Tippical high school drama.

 How petty of her.

He is in my class, his name is David, he's the "class clown" and an ass that body shamed me on a daily bases,  hit me "by accident" everytime we would have PE  and other childish shit like that. He even made me cry a few times and Nicole was the one who comforted me. 

How ironic.

Well when I heard that I was heart brocken , I wanted my friend back.
 
But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that I don't need my friend back, every day since then she started tormenting me with David, even more so spilling my most embarrassing secrets, like when I was on a date and a bird shit on my head, or when I was so scared of the dentist that I wet myself or that I drool in my sleep. Now I can't go to school without getting funny looks from everybody. 

 I wanted to hurt her, to ruin her life and for her to know it was me who did it.

And then it came.

Probably the best idea of my life. I thought, looking back now it was probably the worst, since any day by now I know I am going to be the next...


You see ,only after I successfully accomplished my plan I read more about hypnosis, the person isn't brain-dead while doing what you said, the hypnosis makes them want to do it. 

At first nothing happened for a week, I just thought that it didn't work and I spend months learning some shitty useless tricks, this was untill  I found my dog dead at my front door.

Its head was missing.

And then a moth later David moved schools, at least that's what the teachers were saying. 

Still , i see her everyday at school.


She's always smiling...

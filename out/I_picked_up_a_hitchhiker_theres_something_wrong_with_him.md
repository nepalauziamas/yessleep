This is something I never told anyone but I feel like I should before I die. You see, I have cancer, and my doctors said I don't have much time left before I die.

So I thought it was probably a good time to tell it. Back in 2008, I was driving home from a Christmas party and it was snowing hard out and cold out. There were mostly trees and no cars around, I was a little scared because I'd seen enough horror movies and just wanted to get home.

That's when I saw someone standing there with his thumb out. I wanted to keep driving, but the good person in me told me to stop. I stopped by him and rolled my window down "You need a ride?" He smiled and got in the car "Thanks you don't know how long I've been out there" I noticed he had no bags and was traveling out in the snow with nothing.

"So, why we're you traveling with nothing in this weather?" he said nothing and just kept looking forward. He looked like a young male probably in his early 20s and he looked really cute. I knew I probably had no shot with him, "So, what's a pretty girl like you driving out here in this weather?" 

I blushed seeing how he called me pretty and then told "Oh, I was at a Christmas party with my friends that's all," I noticed his smile went away. I didn't know if I said something wrong.

I went silent and kept driving until he started to talk to himself "Do it, no, come on already" I got a bit freaked out by this. He stopped and looked at me and smiled again. I asked if he was alright, but he didn't say anything and looked out the window. "So, where do you need me to drop you off?"

He looked at me and said, "There's a house up here, drop me off there." I was shocked seeing he lived out here by himself. I just kept driving because he was giving off bad vibes. 

"Bring her in with you, shut up" I was getting nervous about what this guy was saying to himself, but I kept driving not wanting to get him mad. I noticed he had something in his pocket but doesn't want to ask what it was.

He told me to stop the car and when I asked why he got mad and told me to stop. I did and before he got out he looked at me and said: "Just keep driving and whatever I don't stop." He got out and ran into the woods and the moment he was out of sight I drive off.

When I got home I wanted to call my friends and tell them what happened but decided not to and get some rest. A week went by and I forgot all about out, I was sitting on my couch drinking coffee and watching the news.

 It popped up with a story saying a woman was found dead in her car. It said she stopped to pick up a hitchhiker and he stabbed her to death and when they showed his picture I screamed. It was the same hitchhiker I picked up and I was shocked knowing how close I was to dying that night.

The news said that he had been doing this for a long time and he said he dragged their bodies to his abandoned cabin. They said that Satan was telling him to do it and that he would be blessed with immortality. To this day I hadn't told anyone this story until now.

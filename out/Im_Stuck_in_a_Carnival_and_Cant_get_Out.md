I entered the carnival giving them my ticket. I smiled widely and was let in. The sun had started to set but that wouldn’t stop me from having fun. I quickly rushed and checked the time. 5 hours, that’s enough time to have some fun right? I looked up and saw the Ferris wheel. I got in line and had them punch my ticket. I sat on the chair and scooted in to the end.

Other people started to fill the carriage and i was beginning to get squished. But soon enough the Ferris wheel started to spin. “Hey, scoot over, your practically sitting on me.” A man said from the seat across from me. “I can’t! Do you seriously think I can move over here?! We’re basically crammed in here!” The man sitting next to him said. It was true he was almost sitting on him. Although I can’t say their sitting on each anymore now.. 

I looked at the window and saw the sky, how beautiful? I continued to stare out the window and saw the sky slightly darken. I frowned, the heat inside the carriage was going up. I shrugged off my jacket and placed it on my lap consequently hitting the person sitting next to me elbow. “Watch it!” 
“Sorry.”
“Yeah right.” He said under his breath. I scooted over as close as I could and felt him scoot over too. I sighed and continued to look out the window.

The Ferris wheel stopped and soon as we reach the top and felt the carriage jolt. I hit the window hard and felt something hot run down the side of my face. I put my hand to my face and pulled it away revealing blood. I looked around the carriage and saw the other regaining the composure. Some were also bleeding and I noticed a lady had fallen over and wasn’t getting up. My blood ran cold as another passenger got up and checked on her to reveal her face smashed in. Blood dribbled down her chin and her shirt. I looked out the window and saw people running away from the carnival leaving and suddenly dropping. I banged my fist on the window to see a man in black stop, turn around, and raise his gun. The bullet went right through the glass and I ducked just in time. Unfortunately the guy next to me was shot. He dropped onto my shoulder and I pushed him off. Now this brings us here to where we are right now. Some of the passengers tried to jump out of the carriage and onto the beams below. Sadly they did not make it very far before falling to their death where they lay now. 

I’m sitting in the corner of the carriage. We don’t know what to do and it’s already been 3 hours. I’m shaking the other people around me are starting to lose hope and are crying. My phones going to die, pls somebody help us.


Update: luckily one of the passengers had a phone charger they saved me. My phone is somewhat charged. It’s been a couple hours now, the only way out is to climb down the beams. I have looked out and realized the metal of the Ferris wheel is rusting. We’re worried the Ferris wheel might collapse. I’m gonna try to climb down later with some gloves from one of the passengers wish me luck!

Update: This is Fiona he didn’t come back. Sam. Is. Dead. He fell while climbing down. He told us his glove got stuck on a nail and was pulling on it when one of the masked men came and shot him. I am so sorry to everyone we’ll try to update when we can…

Update: This is Fiona again, we haven’t figured a way down. We don’t have enough clothes to make a rope down and it isn’t sturdy enough. We tried to have our weight move the carriage down but it wasn’t enough instead our carriage got loose and fell. Now we’re stuck between two beams and hanging on for dear life. We’ll update once again when we can.

Update: I can’t take it, it’s been 3 days Im so hungry. We decided to eat the woman’s hand from earlier. We barely have any water. I feel like we’re slipping on the beams. We can’t hold on for much longer. I’m being tormented, I’m thinking of ending it. It’s too much.

Hello everyone, this is my first post and I just wanted to start with telling you, I am replacing the names with random letters, and I am no longer friends with anyone in this story.

I was young then, but the memory is still clear as the night it happened. I am a female and at the time, my best friend was a male. I was at his house for a sleepover for his birthday, except I wasn't staying the night since it was all guys. The night was going well, and we all eventually got tired and decided to watch a movie. We all laid out across the living room on the couch and the air mattress. We were about halfway through the movie and it was pitch black outside.

We were absorbed in the movie when we realized something was beeping. Unfazed, we began to search for the source of the beeping. Since we were young, we didn't have phones but we did have iPads. We each checked our iPads but for some reason we checked one kids 2 times. We will call him R. We looked and looked but couldn't find the source. We still remained unfazed but began to call my friend's mom who we will call C.

I think now is the time to mention, they didn't have a small house but with how loud our voices called for her, she should have heard. My friend's younger sister was in a room that was super close to us, so even if his mom didn't hear, his sister should have. No one, not his mom, dad, or sister responded.

"C!" We called.

"MOM!" My friend called.

We screamed over and over, all in fear of leaving the light of the TV into the dark house. Finally she came in. At this point, fear rested on the tips of each of our tongues.

"What's up?" she had asked in her normal, calm, voice. We explained it to her and apparently she hadn't heard our screams, which confused us all. She was pretty close to the room we were in, folding laundry, and should have heard us.

She followed the beeping to R's bag and took out his iPad. That was what had been beeping. We made the beeping stop, but none of us forgot how we had checked his iPad 2 times, and the beeping hadn't stopped once during that time.

C went to go fold laundry again, and we returned to our spots from before and attempted to start the movie again, but we were no longer interested. None of us understood how it could have come from his iPad, or how C didn't hear us.

To this day, I still wonder about it all. Why didn't my friends little sister wake up when she was so close? Why didn't his dad wake up? Why didn't his mom hear our screams? And what really caused the beeping? Was it really the iPad?

If anyone has any similar stories or any ideas on what had happened, please share it with me, because for many years, my story has haunted me and to this day, and I crave to know the truth. Would it have been a better night if I didn't attend my best friend's birthday party?

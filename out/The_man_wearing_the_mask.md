I’ve been being stalked. I moved into my new apartment about 3 months ago. Since I’ve moved in my upstairs neighbor has been stalking me. 

I know it’s him because he always wears this HORRID mask with an unnatural smile and huge eyes.

My roommate said he wears it because he has mental health issues and is super insecure with his face. 

This man has been at my school, work, even outside my dads house when I’m visiting. I haven’t called the cops because I feel bad for him, and I don’t feel threatened in any way.

It’s getting worse. My roommate Kira, caught him looking inside my window, watching me sleep.

He found all my social medias and won’t stop messaging me.

July 1st 2021

So today I got his package. I’m trying not to make it obvious that I’m VERY nervous. I found out his name. “Carl Wood” was printed on the label. 

I know I shouldn’t look through peoples mail, but I couldn’t stop myself. I opened it to discover a gun. A FUCKING GUN! 

Then I heard a knock on my door. Of course, Carl was standing at my door. “I believe you’re holding my package.” His voice was so deep that it made me jump. “Yeah…. Sorry.” He looked at me. I could tell he was smiling, though I couldn’t see his face. 

Now I’m laying in bed, I can’t sleep. Carl has been stalking me for months.. and now he has a gun. What is he planning? 

July 4th 2021 

I got a text from an unknown number. My boyfriend, Spencer was sitting next to me. So when my phone went off he grabbed it. Then I heard him yell.. “Hey babe, who’s Carl?” My heart stopped. “Carl?” I asked. 
“Yeah.” Spencer responded. “He’s just my upstairs neighbor. Why?” Then my boyfriend paused. “He texted you.”

I went into the main room to look at my phone. “Hey River, it’s Carl, can’t wait to see you at the party tonight.” I froze. How does he know I’m going to that party? He doesn’t even know my friend who’s holding the party. She’s my friend from HIGH SCHOOL.

So I start getting ready for the party. I put on a cool party dress, with red and blue, because of course, it’s the 4th of July. 

I see him at the party, he still had that horrible mask on. He came up to me and said “River,-“ before he could finish I walked off, got in my roommates car, and Kira and I drove home. As fast as we could. 

When we got home, Carl was already IN my house. He just sitting in the main room. As soon as he saw us, he ran off. 

Kira and I put in a police report, but the cops stated they couldn’t do much, due to his mental state, and the fact that he hasn’t hurt anyone. They could charge him with break in, but Kira and I decided not to press charges, and just to get an anti harassment order placed. 

March 26th 2022

It’s been a while since I’ve been here. The harassment stopped. Kira and I thought Carl moved, but I saw him again today. 

He still had that mask, it was worn out this time. A piece of the mask was missing revealing his black hair and bright blue eye. He waved to me. I waved back.

I didn’t mention I was at work. He came up to me. He said “River, I’m sorry about Spencer.” Confused, I said “What?” Then he said “Check your text.” So I looked down at my phone. 

I had one text from Spencer. “It’s over.” 
Spencer and I have been on difficult terms lately but I was still heartbroken. Only one goddamn text? Not even a call? I thought. I looked up at Carl and said “How did you know?“
Carl looked at me, all I could see was his eye. Then he walked away.

I got home, miserable. Then I saw Carl, in my home once again. This time it was different, he wasn’t wearing his mask, I could tell it was him from the blue eyes and black hair though, I didn’t have that fear I always felt around him, though he was covered in blood. Wait.. HE WAS COVERED IN BLOOD?!?!

“WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING HERE CARL?” I yelled. He looked at me, he looked manic. He said “I’m sorry, I tried to stop him, every time.” 

I noticed scratches and cuts all over Carl…., and human flesh all around him. “What did you do Carl.” I said, my voice was shaky. Then I grabbed my phone and locked myself in the bathroom.

I dialed Kira. I doubted she was even home yet so hopefully she was safe. I know I should have called 911, but my brain went to Kira first, she was my best friend. As I pressed the call button, I heard a phone ring, in the bathtub beside me. It was Kira’s phone. 

Kira… Kira was dead. I saw my best friend fucking dead. She had chunks missing from her skin. That was the most gruesome scene I’ve ever seen. My best friend was dead. I didn’t have much time to process that because someone began banging on the door. 

I knew it was going to be me next. I was going to die. Carl was finally going to kill me. I heard a crack behind me. The window broke. Carl climbed through the window and said “Let’s go!!! We need to leave!!!”. I stopped for a second. Who was banging on the door? 

The door eventually broke open, I was face to face with Spencer, but this time, he was wearing that horrific worn down mask instead of Carl. 

“Hey babe.” Spencer smiled and took off the cracked mask.

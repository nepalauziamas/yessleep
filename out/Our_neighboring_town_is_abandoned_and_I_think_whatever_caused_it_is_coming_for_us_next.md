There’s a library in my small town. Much like the town itself, a dainty thing composed of shabbily built houses sitting atop stilts, the library is quite insignificant. It’s rare to see another soul browsing the barren shelves which run the length of the building, though it houses perhaps the single most important piece of literature in the state of Louisiana. 

Behind a thick, glass case sits a nondescript, green, spiral notebook. The notebook is simply labeled, ‘Sammy Bowers’, however, the contents couldn’t be more imperative to the survival of those who find themselves in Briggs Isle. 

If you live near or around Briggs, then I strongly suggest you stop by Johnston Public Library and take a look in the glass case sitting next to the help desk. 

For those who are curious and a good, safe distance from Briggs, I snapped a picture of the notebook entries and transcribed them to post here. I figured you, of all audiences, might have a clue as to what’s going on.

‘I can’t exactly pinpoint when the first bits of ash began raining from the skies. Two, maybe three days ago? I’m not sure, it’s all been a blur, quite literally. The grey stuff seems to be falling with greater intensity each morning. The folks around here, in Hanna City that is, were advised to stay indoors. The meteorologists seem just as puzzled as the rest of us. So do the politicians, who’ve promised things are being smoothed over, though I reckon they’ve got their heads too far up their ass to notice a difference. As far as I can tell, our area seems to be the only one afflicted with this phenomenon, though the updates have grown fewer and further between. 

I’ve tried clearing the trailers satellite of debris every few hours, though it seems to do little for the reception. That TVs always had a mind of its own, so nothing new there.

I’m not sure if that ash has been gnawing at the phone lines, the calls to my relatives seem to spaz out after a few seconds or so. I suppose the modern world can be just as much of a bitch as it can be a luxury. 

As it stands, it’s currently half past noon and the sun seems especially dampened today. Yesterday I could see the marsh, which sits about a hundred feet up the lane, just fine. Not so much today.

I run a small crawfish stand, ‘Sammys Crawdad Boil’, which operates underneath a tent directly out front. I mention this because, being just a mere twenty feet from the front door, I’m having trouble reading the sign through the foggy atmosphere. 

I’m hoping it lets up a bit tomorrow, I really need to make a grocery run.

I suppose this journal will receive a bit more use than I’d anticipated. The TV wasn’t working at all this morning, just static accompanied by that harsh noise it emits when there’s no connection. I shut the bastard off real fast.

Fortunately, the weather radio I’d bought last year came in handy. There’s something unnerving in the radios monotonous, robotic voice. Regardless, I was relieved to hear that the National Guard was being deployed, especially after peeking out the window this morning. For reference, I thought it was still nighttime when I woke up, the clock read 10:48 A.M. though... I even double checked. 

That ash is falling like you wouldn’t believe, great, white billows of the stuff. The sun seems as faint as the moon on a particularly cloudy night. 

I can’t really see much outside at this point, even the front steps are caked with the shit. Anyways, the radio will have to do for now, I doubt I’d even be able to find the satellite in this weather.

Two entries in one day? Crazy, I know.

I can’t help but grow worrisome of all this, I try to keep a sunny disposition. It’s about an hour til midnight and the sky has awoken me with bright veins of perpetual lightning. The bolts seem to tear through the heavens and for a moment, just a moment, I glimpse the hazy world out there. I’m not a religious man, but it certainly feels apocalyptic.

I went outside this morning. 

Any semblance of sunlight seems to be receding further each day. It’s unimaginably dark out there... and quiet, like how the snow absorbs sound after it blankets the world. This might sound silly, but I swear it felt like a thousand eyes were following me as I cleared the flower beds of ash. Hell, I don’t know, had I stuck my hand out I doubt I would’ve been able to see my own fingers. 

Ordinarily, I’m pretty tough to rattle, though my sister send me a text this morning, the only message it’s received in the last two days, which sent a chill down my spine.

“There’s things out there”, it read. I’m not sure what she means by it and I don’t think any of my messages are getting back through. I’m debating on driving over to her place, but I’d be blinder than a bat trying to navigate the dark world outside.

I’ll figure it out.

Oh, dear journal, you’ve been the one constant these last couple days. I’d be a madman without this pencil and pad.

The skies are as foamy as ever today, the sun still hiding in the darkness. I miss it, truthfully. I wish I hadn’t cursed the thing on those steamy, humid days where it seemed to beat the life out of ya. I’d take a hundred of those days in a row just to see the skies clear a bit. 

I’m beginning to wonder if this isn’t Mother Nature’s work, her anger. Perhaps a hurricane pushed through and a ‘nonexistent’ nuclear reactor exploded? I don’t know.

I suppose I’ve reached the point of bargaining. 

Even the radios messages are beginning to wear thin, I kindle miss that robot voice.

I had just about dozed off when my radio friend came back to life. Unfortunately, the news was not what I wanted to hear.

Apparently, the convoy of National Guardsman, our saviors, had lost all contact upon entering the storm. I’m not terribly surprised, I haven’t caught a break as far as these stupid electronics go. I just pray that they’re still coming.

There wasn’t much to write about yesterday. The outlook is bleak and my hunger pangs grow in ferocity. I spent most of that day sleeping. The radio, the TV, and my phone have been deadly silent since the news of the guardsmen had passed. 

The ash in the flower beds must be a foot high by now, I can hear the trailers roof struggling under its heaping weight. Optimism is steadily declining. At least the lightning storm still reminds me of a world which had light.

JESUS CHRIST, THERES THINGS OUT THERE. I thought my sister was full of shit, oh, poor FUCKING Beth. I should’ve checked on HER. I SHOULDVE. 

I’ve been watching out the window since my last entry and I’m certain that I’m not alone. I can see these things, these creatures, dancing and peeking from the trees as the lightning illuminates their shadows. 

I think they know I’m in here.

I didn’t get much sleep last night, and when I’d finally begun to doze off, a noise awoke me. A siren.

At first I thought it was rescue, the guardsmen, but the noise was unlike any other siren I’d ever heard before. It was low and harsh, like gravel, and once it winded down, three crackly, whooping sounds would follow. 

I’m not a religious man, but I’m praying to God for forgiveness.

They’ve found me. 

They’ve fucking found me. 

There eyes are dead, I shouldn’t have looked out the window. I can hear them slithering and smacking the sides of the trailer as I write this. 

Long faces, they look like those plague doctors with a sagging, pale beak. When I looked, when we made eye contact, it’s arm lifted and set a long, black tendril on the window pane. 

It squirmed, it snaked. It was looking for a way in.

I have nothing to board the windows.

I saw God today. 

His long, pale legs stretched endlessly to the heavens. The Earth seemed to quake with each massive footstep He took. 

Perhaps I’m just in shock, but I’m no longer afraid. 

I’m ready to go outside.

That’s it, that’s where it ends. 

I’m not entirely sure how long this post will be allowed to stay up, I can’t imagine they’d want the word to get out about this. The government, even locally, has been suspiciously quiet about the events which took place in Hanna City all those years ago. 

I can’t seem to find anything about it on the internet, either. 

Either way, I’ve decided to go pick up my own spiral notebook, a green one, and begin documenting my own story. You see, Hanna City is only a hop, skip, and a jump from Briggs Isle, though it’s been long abandoned for... unknown reasons. 

Just before I passed the portal into the library, as I scaled the weathered, wooden stairs which led up to its front door, I swear  I could see tiny bits of ash raining down.

If you live in the US, you probably know about the "Florida Man" meme from all of the newspaper headlines.

"Florida Man throws alligator in drive through window"

"Florida Man arrested while snorkeling naked in dumpster"

"Florida Man robs gas station with small army of pet raccoons"

You get the point. If Florida Man were a super hero, you probably would rather be saved by someone else, and you might imagine that growing up in Florida, you develop a pretty high tolerance for weird shit.

I grew up in Florida, and I'm well past my threshold.

This all started just under 2 weeks ago when my dad sent me a picture of a big doll wearing jeans and a gator t-shirt while he was emptying out an old storage unit.

"Want this now?" he captioned it

"Oh God, why do you still have that thing?" I asked him

"Seemed weird to get rid of it after everything" he replied

I understood what he meant.

"I get it. Maybe you should just leave it be." I replied

"No it's time to let it go. Putting it in the junk" 

"Maybe you should burn it?" I offered

"Too much work, I have to get this unit cleared today" and he left it at that.

Three days after that, he sent another photo of the doll sitting on the front porch of their house.

"Someone is having a joke at our expense." He messaged with the photo.

"Dad I think you should burn it."

Three days later, he sent me a photo of the doll in my old room.

"Someone broke in. I think we both know who is doing this. Going to have to call the cops."

I was getting more desperate, begging him to just burn the doll. He finally agreed.

That night at 3 am, I received a photo of the doll in the woods from my dad's phone. I didn't see it until the morning.

I tried calling him and got no answer. I tried my mom next, and she answered me frantically, saying my dad had left the house the night before. She had tried to put out a silver alert when the cops told her she couldn't file a missing person's report, but my dad didn't have a history of dementia or anything.

The designated time passed to file a report. They found his car parked near an abandoned house near a pine forest, and I agreed to come help with the search. I already knew we wouldn't find him.

You see, this actually started 23 years ago, with the events that led to us getting that doll in the first place.
____________________________

You might be shocked how many people live in Florida that are not from Florida. The fact is, Florida had fewer than a million people living there less than a century ago, and now it's one of the most populous states in the union with over 24 million people.

Most people, like me, had come to the state within the past generation or two, but as a kid, my best friend, Leeroy, could trace his lineage back to Florida Crackers that had been in the state since before the Revolutionary War.

Now that didn't really make him royalty or anything, in fact Florida Cracker culture is going extinct today, kept alive by a few proud folks and museums. 

His family lived in an old house, bordering on a cabin, that his parents would fix up themselves. His family had at one point owned over a hundred acres of land, though over the generations it had been divided among children and pieces of it sold off.

Leeroy's dad had grown up with my dad, and when they had sons in the same year, our families had gotten even closer. Running through the pines on his property was one of my earliest memories.

Leeroy was a true Florida boy. He got a pocket hunting knife for his sixth birthday. He and his dad would camp out on their property every month to learn survival skills.

Leeroy did his best to pass those skills on to me, and we would kayak up the rivers, fish, camp out, swap spooky campfire stories, and play manhunt in the woods with some other kids from town when the full moon was bright.

In third or fourth grade, our best friendship expanded to include Jimmy, whose parents had just moved them to town. 

His dad was a doctor of internal medicine, and mostly treated retirees in the town. His mom was a lawyer of some sort.

I would say Jimmy was rich. His house was huge and had its own gate and road. He dressed preppy, though I don't think that word was in my fourth-grade vocabulary. He was also a wuss, a word that was definitely in my fourth-grade vocabulary.

By all means he should not have been friends with me, let alone Leeroy, but despite our differences in class and personality, we had one passion that united us.

We all loved the paranormal.

On our kayaking trips, we would try to spot "the Swamp Ape" (think bigfoot, but you know, in a swamp) past the mangroves. Jimmy had managed to buy a Ouija board (a Hasbro brand or something haha) without his parents knowing, and we would play with it at his house and on our camping trips. We'd watch any scary movies we could, sneaking into the R rated ones, and of course, we continued our campfire stories.

Jimmy told us that before his family had moved, there had been a man who killed his own parents and said he'd been possessed. His dad had told him it was just an excuse, but Jimmy had seen the man's eyes solid black in the street the day earlier. That's what got him into the paranormal.

For Leeroy and me, his dad's stories about Florida ghosts and legends were the origin of our love for the spooky and weird. We had even convinced him to take us to "The Devil's Bench" one year, but he wouldn't let us sit on it.

We kept up our antics until we were all teenagers when, one summer, Jimmy convinced his parents to rent us a beach house in the Keys for a week. We were each 16 or 17 and going by ourselves, so it took some convincing for our parents, but they finally caved.

Jimmy drove us down in his dad's Land Rover and the plan was basically to hang out at the beach, maybe some boating, and get drunk on alcohol purchased with my fake ID.

Well, and we had a few stops on our paranormal tour.

We ate at Sloppy Joe's, a restaurant and bar built on top of the trees they used to use to hang pirates and where, about a decade early, they had found a bunch of human remains during renovations.

The other highlight of the tour was Robert the Doll, and I wish we would have skipped it.

Robert is an old, straw-stuffed doll from the early 20th century. You're welcome to go read the full story elsewhere, but I'll include the gist of it.

This doll was given to a boy by his allegedly voodoo-practicing nanny. People claim you could see the doll smiling in his window, that Robert and this boy would "talk to each other", and the boy would blame the doll whenever he got into a bit of mischief. Eventually, the boy got old and died, and then someone who had bought his house donated the doll to a museum in Key West, presumably to get it the heck out of the house, where it still sits today.

People say the doll is still evil, and if you take its picture without permission or are rude to him, he'll curse you. Plenty of people have blamed accidents and misfortune on this.

I've heard this doll is the inspiration for the Chucky movies, but I'm not sure if that's true. He was certainly the inspiration for the truly awful Robert movies released in the past few years. Typical spooky doll shit.

We, being the type of naive kids that played with Ouija boards and called out Bloody Mary in front of mirrors in dark bathrooms, obviously were going to go provoke this doll for our own entertainment.

When we actually saw the thing, we hesitated.

We believed the paranormal stuff, but mostly for the thrills. When you go to a haunted house or a scary movie, you know nothing is really going to hurt you, but the possibility works its way past your mental defenses. That feeling just before the third "Bloody Mary", when your heart falls into icy waters and every nerve in your body screams at you to stop was the whole reason we loved this.

Maybe it's a Florida thing 

Robert the Doll is messed up. You wouldn't give that thing to a child unless you were running a long con that required you to bankrupt them in therapy costs as an adult. 

The thought of him haunting us was not a pleasant one.

The notes around him begging forgiveness didn't help.

"Maybe we shouldn't" Jimmy said. 

Honestly this surprised me. He was still a wuss, but in a way he was the craziest of the three of us- in a way that only a rich, white boy can be. He had an air of invincibility and entitlement that almost made you believe he actually was invincible.

He was the kind of guy that might snort coke and belly flop into the pool from a 4th floor hotel balcony. In fact, I heard he had landed himself in the hospital and, subsequently, rehab doing exactly that later in life.

I didn't say anything, but looked meaningfully at Leeroy.

"God, y'all are such chicken shits. Must be all that yank blood." He laughed. "I'll go first then."

He erected his middle finger and stuck it against the glass, smirking.

"Hey Robbie, how d'ya like that?" He asked the doll 

I was emboldened by this, and him grouping me with Jimmy had stung.

I grabbed my crotch and shouted too, "yeah you dumb doll, what you going to do about it?"

Jimmy still looked uncomfortable with the whole situation, but finally joined in and said something lame like, "yeah, did your mommy pick that outfit?"

Leave it to the rich kid to pick on his clothes off all things.

After that, we took turns taking pictures with the doll with disposable Kodak cameras. We didn't ask permission; the film couldn't be developed for some reason.

As we left, Jimmy hung behind, and I heard him apologizing under his breath.

Before I tell you this next part, I want to say that Jimmy and I both had our notes on display at one point in time in that museum. His said,

"I never wanted to go along with that. I'm so sorry I offended you. The other two are to blame. Take them."

Mine said

"If we knew, we never would have said those things to you. I'm sorry. Please bring my friend back."

That night at the beach house, we got drunk. A storm had rolled in, and we were watching the waves crash on the shore from a covered, second floor balcony.

"Man, I thought maybe there would be something to that doll." Leeroy said with disappointment in his voice "Next trip we go on should be to the  Devil's Bench and actually sit on it."

"I knew it was bullshit" Jimmy chimed in. 

Leeroy and I laughed. 

"Screw you guys, I'm gonna go take a piss" he said, and he stood up and left.

A minute later, I turned to say something to Leeroy, when a flash of lightning illuminated his face and his eyes widened.

"The hell is that?!" He said, pointing at the beach.

I squinted and couldn't see much in the darkness.

"I.. I don't see anything?" I said confused

"Wait for the lightning" he said, staring.

I kept my vision tracked on the beach where he was looking. I thought he was messing with me for a second, but when the lightning flashed, I saw the small silhouette of what appeared to be a child.

"Fucking Jimmy." I said. "Trying to freak us out to get even."

"I saw that not two minutes after Jimmy left. You trying to tell me he's The Flash or something?"

"Would explain the lightning" I meekly tried to joke. Neither of us laughed.

Another flash of lighting. Maybe it was my imagination, but the shadow seemed closer to the house this time.

"Shit, do you think that's a kid? Maybe we should see if we can find Jimmy" I said

Leeroy kept his eyes peeled on the spot. "You go. I'll keep an eye on this thing"

I got up and turned into the house. As I opened the door, a crash of thunder tore the sound barrier apart and the lights in the house died. I cursed to myself and made my way to the hall.

Jimmy wasn't in the upstairs bathroom. This seemed to confirm my suspicions that he was behind it. I eased up a bit and returned to the balcony.

"Jimmy you prick! We know it's you!" I yelled out to the figure. Silence.

I tried again, but as I was finishing up "you asshole", Jimmy walked back out onto the balcony.

"What did I do now?" He said 

"I checked the bathroom, you weren't there. We know you're trying to spook us." I said

Leeroy was still staring out at the beach this whole time, not saying anything.

"I had to shit, so I went downstairs for privacy. Which one of you killed the lights? I pissed on my shoes because of that."

That took me off guard. "I thought you were shitting?" I asked

"Yeah and then I stood up to piss afterwards. What kind of man pisses sitting down?"

I didn't have time to figure out how to reply to that because lightning struck again.

"Who the hell is that?!" Jimmy shouted.

Well, there went my theory.

The wind started to pick up into a howl, and I wondered briefly if a hurricane had somehow formed and made landfall without a news broadcast. I was considering going to find our beach radio, when the sound of a door opening and slamming several times downstairs interrupted the thought.

Leeroy stood up.

"Y'all stay here." Was all he said. He flicked out a pocket knife and walked inside.

When the lightning struck again, there was no figure on the beach.

I looked at Jimmy. He looked like he would be pissing himself if he hadn't just been to the bathroom.

We stood in an uncomfortable silence for a few minutes.

"We have to go help him" I said finally.

"Leeroy's a freaking swamp man! I've literally seen him wrestle a gator! Me going would just be a liability!" He said

He was a chicken, but he had a point.

I heard a crash and a yowl from downstairs.

"Come on!" I said and walked inside. He followed me as far as the bedroom.

I walked into the hallway and the door shut behind me with the click of a lock. Coward.

As I reached the stairwell, I could hear grunts and a sound like a chair sliding across a wood floor. I quickened my pace, still careful not to trip in the dark.

Nobody believed me when I told them what I saw next. "Trauma memory distortion" was the official verdict. It didn't help that Jimmy never backed me up.

I couldn't see much, but my eyes were already adjusting to the dark. I saw Leeroy's shadow standing hunched in the center of the living room. Even in the dark, I could tell he was in bad shape.

Lightning flashed and illuminated the room for a second.

Leeroy was bloody and bruised already, but there was nobody else in the room. He stood, surrounded by disoriented furniture, holding his pocket knife pointed at nothing.

He saw me too before the room faded back into darkness, his eyes widened into a look of sadness and fear. "Run" was all he said.

I heard another wood-on-wood screech followed by an audible rush of air as something flew across the room.

A dark mass hit Leeroy's silhouette at around shoulder height with a thud. Leeroy slouched to the ground and there was a wooden clatter as the kitchen chair that had hit him fell to the ground.

I stepped off the foot of the stairs towards him, and was met with an awful groan that turned into a screech as a couch-shaped mass skidded towards me at what must have been over 20 miles per hour. It splintered the wooden railings of the staircase as it made impact, narrowly missing me.

I missed the next illumination of the room in what must have been shock, but I heard Leeroy grunt as he regained his feet.

"Damned doll" he groaned "come out here and fight me yourself!"

I heard rattling of metal and a sound not unlike a volley of arrows being loosed, at least how they sound in the movies. Leeroy screamed, and I heard his pocket knife drop to the ground.

I was on my feet again and halfway over the couch before lightning struck again. There were several knives embedded in the wall opposite Leeroy from the kitchen, two had hit their mark. He had one buried to the hilt in his right shoulder and one sticking through his hand on the same side.

Leeroy was facing away from me towards the window past him on the far side of the room.

Robert the Doll was framed by the window, smiling a shit-eating grin with his middle finger pressed against the glass.

The lights came back on in full. All the furniture, including the couch I was now frozen on top of, raised into the air. The lights began to buzz and flicker. The furniture slammed disjointedly into the ground in an arrhythmic BANG BANG-BANG B-B-BANG.

I toppled forward onto the floor as the couch I was on slammed down.

Leeroy gurgled out a choking sound and drew my focus back to him.

He was slowly lifting into the air neck-first, hands pulling at an invisible noose, feet dangling limply.

POP

The first lightbulb shattered, spraying down a shower of glass before I even had a chance to think.

I shielded my face with my arm and tried to get up, feeling needles of glass shredding at my arm.

POP BANG P-P-BANG

Furniture was still raising and slamming as I tried to make my way to Leeroy through the labyrinth of moving furniture and the hail of lightbulb fragments.

Each step my bare feet crunched in broken glass.

I was maybe three steps from him when everything stopped.

The remaining lights were full blast, the furniture was all maybe 4 foot off the ground, there wasn't a sound.

Robert was standing on the window sill now, face and both palms pressed against the glass. His eyes were wide and his mouth in a giddy grin. He looked like a little kid at the zoo.

In an instant, the furniture slammed, the rest of the lightbulbs exploded in a spray of glass and sparks, and Leeroy flew across the room and slammed into a wall.

He collapsed into a pile like a puppet with its strings cut.

I felt like I was being put through a cheese grater.

I tried my best to make it to Leeroy, but for good measure, I was hit in the back by a kitchen chair.

When I woke up, I was in a hospital. Jimmy had called the cops when the power came back.

Leeroy was never seen again

The cops believed that he was abducted, but obviously not by a haunted doll.

They chalked my account up to trauma and my injuries from being knocked out in a scuffle with whoever took Leeroy. That also apparently explained the displaced furniture and broken lightbulbs.

Some local tabloid papers published my actual account of events, which was good advertising for the museum I guess.

Leeroy's parents didn't blame me for him missing, but they did blame me for "telling tales" about what happened. I think his dad thought I was afraid the kidnapper would come after me for retribution if I helped the cops.

A month later, I wrote my apology to Robert, and asked for Leeroy back. I should've tried sooner, but part of me had hoped the cops would just find him. Maybe the chair to the head really had scrambled my memories.

A couple weeks after I got a letter back saying the museum would give Robert my letter, and soon after that I saw Leeroy's dad's car at my house when I got home from school.

As I was walking in, I heard.

"-because of that boy's stories! That bastard is just messing with us now."

When I opened the door, he stopped talking, excused himself, and left.

I walked in to where my dad was sitting and was horrified to see Robert on the couch.

Then I realized it wasn't Robert. It was wearing Leeroy's jeans and the T-shirt with an alligator on it he had been wearing that night. He had blue beady eyes and brown hair painted on. This was a doll version of Leeroy.

"Someone left it on their porch" was all my dad said.

It didn't feel right to throw out that doll, but I couldn't stand to look at it. I tried to leave it in my closet, but it would always be by my bed when I woke up. I tried to give it away a few times, but most people in my town knew the story and thought I was either cursed or playing a really sick joke.

I ended up finding a spot for him on a dresser in my room until I left for college.

"This is your spot now." I said, and against my better judgment, I put Leeroy's old pocket knife there with him.

He didn't move from that spot for a year.

When I left for college, I told him, "I have to go to college now. I'm sorry things ended up this way, but I need you to behave for my parents. I'll come get you some day."

I could swear I heard Leeroy's voice say "thanks man."

At some point, I can't to visit and he was gone. I had assumed my parents had gotten rid of him.

This is why I was so panicked to see the picture my dad sent me of that doll after all these years. I had long since convinced myself that the doll story was made up, and my memories of the Leeroy doll were my way of holding on to him.

And now, 2 weeks later, my dad is nowhere to be found. His car was found outside Leeroy's parents' long abandoned house.  I flew down to Florida to help with the search party, although I know I never will see my dad again- at least not the same way.

Today I finally mustered up the courage to check the storage unit, and sitting just behind the roll up gate, I found two dolls. Leeroy and my dad.

I don't know how I'm going to explain this to my mom. I don't know what I can do with these dolls. Maybe I can rob a gas station.

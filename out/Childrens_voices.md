 

It was the summer of 2005 that me and three friends decided to spend the night in one of Sweden's most haunted houses. You have read how previous visitors experienced their stay, all the inexplicable events that took place and now it was our turn to get answers to all the doubts that existed. The first impression was that you saw a completely ordinary house, well preserved for its age, but we did not know what awaited us behind closed doors later that evening.

It was cold for summer time and when the sun started to go down there were big prolonged rain showers, something that would keep us in the house. We decided to make a fire in the great hall from the wood we found outside in the shed next to the house but it was useless.. the wood had become wet, damp from the rain outside but we didn't give up and kept burning.

The more the evening began to approach, the more we began to experience inexplicable events. There were little whispers and noises from upstairs, as if there were small children up there playing hide and seek with us. We could also see how there were toys on the floors that were absolutely not there when we arrived. I remember one specific thing that happened when we were going down.

I go last and then I see how the rocking horse starts to rock slowly back and forth, that's when I heard it. A child's voice and it said said my name **"Melinda come and play with us"**. A friend sat still in a dark room next to the great hall. **" How is it?"** I asked cautiously without answering. 

He could be seen sitting on an old chair, with his feet crossed and his eyes fixed on the old wooden floor. It almost looked like something was holding him down in the chair.

As I was about to go back to the others he exclaimed in panic **"Please STAY with me"!** With eyes still fixed on the floor. I felt the cold bodies crawl up onto my back while suddenly there was a figure right behind my friend. **" Run!"** I shouted and we all ran out of the house.

Now we got scared, it was pitch black outside and the rain continued to devour the surroundings. Panic reigns, some now wanted to cancel the stay and go home, while others wanted everyone to stay and stick together.

After a while we heard a big bang from inside and we decided to pluck up the courage and check what it was that caused the big bang.. When we entered the house we saw that the great hall was empty,.. The fire was burning full blast!

The fire we tried to start for several hours was now burning. We were completely blown away by what we saw, **"how is this possible?"** , **"Is anyone here?"** We approach the fire and see strings of light leading into the dark room where my friend used to sit. We followed the tracks,..closer and closer to the room. And when we were in the middle of the room, we stopped in horror...

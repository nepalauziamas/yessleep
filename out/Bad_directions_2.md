I looked forward and there in the distance was the same man, this time in the middle of the road.
He was moving and flailing all around, almost like dancing… but not quite…

It was just then that I noticed we were really slowing down, he was about 300 or so feet from us now, his dancing and smile getting more vivacious as we neared.

“Why are you slowing down?” I asked

“I can’t hit him and I can’t drive through trees Mindy!” 

As we started to slow down he started to run towards us, smiling, hooting loudly.

“Mindy please drive please fucking drive”

“I can’t I would hit him” 

“So fucking hit him”

“Mindy what the fuck-“

**hooting and laughing**

The man crawled up on the hood, with an open mouth smile, eyes wide panting, laughing 

**ha HA HA HUH HA huh huh huh **

“HOLLY PLEASE!” 

“Okay FUCK THIS!”
Holly slammed her foot on the gas and the man leaned forward and crashed hard into the windshield

**hnnng**
He began to lick the windshield when holly hit the brakes hard and he flew off. 

He laid there on the ground, limp, and me and holly froze. 

“What do we do now?” I asked 

“He was being weird we felt threatened we can’t get in trouble for this can we?” Holly whispered 

“Look at the windshield… that isn’t blood.. is it? It looks brown, not really red…” I said

Holly scooted closer to the windshield to take a look.

“Oh shit Mindy he’s getting up…”

**hnnng ha ha huh hahHA HA HA HUH**

We looked over the hood of the car and saw he was in fact  getting up, each broken bone cracking back into place loudly, as he stood. 

The final crack was his neck, snapping back into place. 

**Ha HA HUH HAHA ha ha Ha… ha… Hal… holly**

My blood ran cold. 

Holly started crying. 

“Wh… why does he know my name?” she whispered through tears

“Hit him” I whispered

She looked at me, sobbing, frightened. 

“Hit him! Run his ass over NOW HOLLY!” I screamed at her, hoping she would run him over and end this 

She whipped her head around and switched the car to reverse, backed the car up, shifted into drive and stomped the gas. 

He began running towards us, as we were about to collide he jumped on top of the car.

“KEEP GOING KEEP GOING!” I screamed

Holly started driving faster, trying to get him off the car by swirving. 

We could hear him crawling on the hood of the car, and then this awful scratching noise. 

“What’s he doing Mindy what the fuck is he doing”

“I don’t know..” I said, staring at the roof. 

The metal top to the sunroof started to move, and I saw hollys face turn red, she slammed on the breaks but it was too late. 

All of a sudden the sunroof was off. Just like that. I could see his face, smiling at me… so many teeth… the closer he was the more inhuman he looked. His nose had only one nostril, his eyes had no pupils, he didn’t have eyebrows… it was like someone got all the details of a human slightly wrong. 

**HA HUH huh huh hah huh … huh.. holly**

He said, never blinking. 

Holly screamed in terror, I froze. 

“What do we do now?” I whispered

“I don’t know…” she replied, shaking. 
I wanted to grab Hollys hand, but selfishly I’m glad I didn’t, because the man swiftly reached down into the car, his entire mouth unhinged, and he extended his neck to help him put his mouth around holly and swallow her whole. 

It happened so fast she didn’t even have time to scream. 

Once he was finished he climbed down and walked back into the Forrest. 

I sat there shocked for a second before I moved to the drivers seat and floored it until I saw a fork in the road. Left said university Blvd and right said highway, I turned left. 







Why did I turn left… I could’ve gotten back on the highway and just went back home. 

What would I have told my parents? Or Hollys mom?

What would I tell Hollys girlfriend…?

A few more miles and I started to see street lights, a town, and eventually a saw directions to the university… 

it wasn’t until I got to safety and other actual humans that I was able to notice the drivers seat was wet with hollys urine… I can’t blame her. 

I arrived at the university and I parked my car waaay in the back. Normally as a woman I wouldn’t do this as it isn’t safe but I just couldn’t bear having to explain why the sunroof was ripped off and the windshield cracked and full of murky brown “blood”.  

my parents had set up for Holly and I to have an overnight experience at the university, staying in the dorms. 

I grabbed my duffel bag and hollys too… i didn’t want to leave her stuff in the car to get stolen. 

I was about to head in when I realized I was covered in sweat, small bits of metal and glass and we’ll… hollys piss. 

I grabbed some clothes and changed behind my car as fast as possible, I left the soiled clothes in the trunk. 

I made my way inside, and a college kid at the front desk greeted me and checked my ID. 

“AWESOME, it’s nice to meet you Mindy I’m Grayson and I see here you’re in Hall C room 109, you should be bunking with someone named Holly, who hasn’t checked in yet.”

“Yeah I don’t think she’s coming… “ I whispered 

“We’ll if she doesn’t you’ll have the room all to yourself, so score amirite?” He laughed

I was too traumatized and exhausted by recent events to even reply.  

“Alriiiiiiight… well it looks like I’ll be seeing you tomorrow, im running your tour group around campus!” He said while handing me a key card. “your room is just down that hall and to the left, you’re gonna go up to the 3rd floor and you’ll read the signs from there”


“Thanks Gary” 

“Uh it’s Grayson…”

“Sure, George” I mumbled, walking down the hall, to the left, up the elevator, and following the signs to my room.

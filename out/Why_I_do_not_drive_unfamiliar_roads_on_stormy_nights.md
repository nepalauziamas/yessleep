For  a few weeks throughout the summer  months, both my parents   my mother and father would take  these sorta mini-vacation trips   together out of state  just as a way  to enjoy time with  one of another as I have  older my parents started letting me stay alone   I would  then be allowed to stay home  even more during the day     at the  time I just received my driver’s licenses and also save up enough money to by something so I found a ninety-four Dodge Dakota it was not some dream  like  a Lexus, Mercedes or something very luxurious but it was and still something for me to use  to get me from point A to point B and was in around my rounding of a $4,000 dollar budget with using the rest for a few minor fix it up 

Before moving further on with the story here is a little background  information on myself   I will be referring to myself as James  for the sake of the story  I am now  the age of nineteen  and soon I will  be entering my  twenties   at the time when this happened I was around the around seventeen so I was legal to drive all by myself and 

Since  I   would pretty much be home alone all day and night by myself I basically have the potential of doing pretty much what I want when I want teenager mentality can you feel as if you had already the top of the mountain at times does it huh one night I decided to ride into town now heads up from house to town is around twelve and twenty miles and between the distance are rolling hills of roads that turn sharply between forest and bushes alongside the stretch of pavement fast it was around after eight-thirty which meant I would sooner than later should be the sunset to the west.

Was about Around sixteen  minutes later I had arrive in the  town area remembering why I came to   town in the first place is to buy a few items 

I stopped  at a local store to pick some things up for the remainder  of the week 

I had to be in the store  for around twenty  to thirty  minutes after leaving I stopped for gas and  also brought some snacks a mountain dew and two bags of chips after leaving I found myself on which way I wanted to make it back home I could drive back where I came off of or choose this road I was not familiar with although  sooner to be dark or late evening 

I decided on  riding  down this  particular road  hopefully taking this  one back home  and  also having sorta  a little solo  joyride along with seeing the site despite it being a night out 

As I was  driving farther down the road  I  noticed it started  with droplets  tapping on the windshield to  sprinkling  to the windshield being covered with water 

It started raining the  once void of a bumpy  road ahead of my view  was a crystal clear white of water rushing as if  it was a cascade of the hood of my truck while reflecting off the beaming light not a big deal its summer it rains whatever about eight minutes later it is a straight onslaught of pale trickles of rain so much it was making a near-impossible job of seeing someway somehow I was able to find a clearing as a mean of parking or at least fifteen minutes all I could do in that timeframe is just sit there I hear the hammering of water from above on the roof of the truck while wondering where the  dark world I was at 

It gradually started to calm  down well monetary 

Oh god when how much  longer is it going to rain 

I guess just watching it rain  so made me slowly  drift off to sleep I woke up across the driver’s and front passenger seat to a strange tapping sound no not rain but more as if someone or something is either brushing  or tapping against the truck  I  do not see anything and also it is still  raining    then I  see something like something  is moving on the distance  looked like  the casting of a shadow of a  tall person a very large and tall person or rather something resembling a person at such a large stature 

It looked to be standing at least over an incredible  stature of   at least seven foot five 

As soon I have seen this thing it started moving at a very fast pace at least at around a speed of 20mp which might not sound fast but a lofty-built creature that is less than eighty or so feet from you is pretty fast, to say the least, and as it was  approaching the truck it was  under  at least 20 feet from my vehicle  I then  shifted   the  truck 

into drive and floored it  hard as it  could possibly go  all I remember was hearing the engine roar like a beast and the sound of  silt and debris flying  into due to the back tires and that humanoid-looking thing trying to catch up with me before I hit pavement instead of continuing further down the road I decided it would be best to drive where I knew which was the stretch of road I drove previously while driving I was thinking  and sweating very profusely about what  had transpired 

Within less than ten minutes I was already back in the town  which I went home the way came in previously and then I made it back home dropping everything and sat on the floor of my bedroom and 

The next day I talked to one of my mutual friends of mine let's call him luck for the story of my experience  I told him about the road I decided to drive on and the rest of the story

waited where you were driving? I told him I drove down such and such name road he said there been an urban legend on what The urban legend goes like this when the sky is fair the road is clear when driving down on an isolated rainy night it appears to those who come near its territory will make it to appear and also people who stopped on that stretch of road has gone missing along with their vehicles still parked just no ability to have a body in plain view after that I do not and will do not drive on any road or street I'm not off the back familiar with or which do not know of its origin.

Just trying my hand at writing, a short 4,000 word serial killer story. I appreciate all feedback, let me know if I should pursue writing, or just keep my day job. 

1. John Michael Morgan

The sun was out, and the sky bright blue when John unlocked the doors, turned on the lights, and hung the open sign on the door. Whistling to the tune of "Winds of Change", he got his station set up for his first customer of the day. Fitting, the only constant in life is change, he thought. The bell over the door chimed, and he turned to see Walt Montgomery walk in and sign the sign in sheet. "Hey Walt, you're a little early today." Walt looked up at John with a grin, and said "Big day today, needed to get in as soon as possible. Anyone else sign up before me?" John shook his head, "Nope, youre my first. What are we getting today, the usual?" Walt laughed, and looked John in the eye, "Just take a little off the top, and ill have you trim the beard, and a hot towel treatment is all. I have an appointment at 10am, so lets make it quick, Okay?" John looked at Walt a minute, and smiled. "Of course, Walt. Ill get you fixed right up."

"So, you got something important going on today?" John asked as he worked. Walt sat in the chair, reading his newspaper as John ran the trimmers. "Yeah, actually. Im meeting with Billy Turner at 10 this morning, going to be looking into a new business venture." John nodded, nice. What is it that you do again, Walt?"

"Oh, my day job is sales at the furniture store, Hillshires, but this deal with Billy is going to be different." John, intrigued, asked "Oh, yeah? Hows that?" Walt smiled, "Yeah, actually got lucky and came across Billy when he bought a bedroom set from Hillshires a few weeks ago. We hit it off almost immediatley, and he got to talking about how he has made his money. He started off in sales like me, but then he got into real estate after he inherited some land. Now a days, he started selling time shares, for big time business people from all over. He says he needs someone who meets the clients on site, and makes sure everything they need is taken care of. Pays my years salary in a single weekend...but you never heard this from me, he says not to talk about it too much, doesnt want any competition popping up in this area."

John thought that this was a little weird, such a high salary for showing off timeshares, for weekend get aways, and setting up the client with whatever they need, for a salary of over $100,000 for a weekend. Hmm, he didnt have to be a human lie detector, to know that this was bullshit, but not his place. Still, he was intrigued. "Well, if you can make that much for a weekend of work, man I say take it, and run. I would kill for an opportunity like that." Walt smiled at him, "Well, to be honest I could use a helping hand. Someone I trust, someone who can keep it quiet. Sound good to you?" John thought about it for a minute, "I could use the extra cash. Sure, im up for it." Walt beamed, "Good! Let me talk to Billy this morning, Ill bring you up, and get it set up. Ill let you know how it goes later this evening, okay?"

At 7 pm after all his haircuts, and towel treatments were done, and he cleaned, and locked up for the day, John headed for his car, and headed home, still whistiling "Winds of Change". He had thought about his conversation with Walt this morning, all day. He wasnt sure, but something about the offer was off, but " Why did Walt invite me to join if it was shady?" Obviously it wasnt something too crazy, or else Walt wouldnt have spoken so freely about it. "Whatever, as long as it pays, and no one finds out about who I really am."

When he got home, John jumped in the shower, before throwing some cold lasagna in the microwave, and turning on the TV. He pulled up Netflix, and turned on the show, "Stranger Things".

As he pulled out the piping hot food, and poured himself some water, he sat on the couch, and zoned out to the show. When the phone rang at 9:30, he let it go to voicemail. When it continued to ring 5 times in a row, he finally picked up, with a ,"What do you want?"'

There was a pause, and then Walt's voice spoke up, "John? Sorry to bother you so late, its Walt. Remember I told you I would let you know how the meeting with Billy went?" "Oh yes I remember, sorry didnt recognize your number. So how did it go?"

"Went good, you are a go. I repeat you are a go."

"What are we pretending to be secret agents now? So whats the job entail?"

"Well if you want in on this, we do have to be somewhat secret about it. Like I said earlier, we dont want competition. Meet me at the overlooks Saturday at 11:00am. Over.", and the line went dead. John looked at the reciever for a second, and slowly put the phone back on the cradle, and went back to eating his dinner. He watched the show, but his mind was on the weird vibe he got from Walt. Walt was a goof, but something was weirder than normal about the way he was acting, and John could not afford to get into business with someone who might dig into his past.

2. Timeshare agents for hire

Saturday, June 6 2022

John arrived an hour early, and watched from the property across the street from The Overlooks. At 10:30 Billy Turner drove into the parking lot. As he got out of his Mercedes, he looked around carefully. Way too carefully for someone just worried about competition, John thought. Lots of money for simple seeming jobs, with high paranoia was a recipe for trouble. The illegal kind. John was interested, but not for the reasons Walt, and Billy thought.

John walked up to Billy when he saw Walt pull into the parking lot. "Hey Billy? Im John Morgan." John stuck out his hand for Billy to shake. Billy just stared at Johns outstretched hand. "Sorry, Mate. Im a germ-a-phobe. Apologies." John retracted his hand, "Right, no worries." Walt walked up to the pair, "I see you two have met." Billy, and John nodded. Billy said, "Alright mates, let's go into property 4310, and I will show you what you, and Walt will be doing."

John followed Billy, and Walt up the walkway, and stared out over Lago Serranos that the property overlooked. John whistled, "Quite a view, eh?" Neither Billy, or Walt replied. Billy opened the door, and stepped aside. "Gentlemen, welcome to Casa Cashola." Walt walked in, and John followed.

Billy closed the door behind them. The property was beautiful, mahogany floors, big tv's in all living areas. Stainless steel kitchenware, big sliding glass door that opened to a large balcony, with a beautiful view overlooking the lake. John turned to Billy, "So... We meet up with rich clientelle, set them up for short stays in this luxury condo, and then what? do we give them grand tours of Chino?"

Billy snorted, " Well you got most of that right, but first let me ask you a question, John." John : "Shoot."

Billy turned to look out over Lago Serranos, thought for a moment, and then asked, "John what do you do? Not as in your job, Walt says youre a barber. You dont look like a barber to me, mate, but that's neither here, nor there. What do you do for fun, what are your hobbies, political views, religious views? Whats your view on family, on life in general?"

John was a little thrown off by this line of questioning. He thought for a moment, answering carefully, "Alright, ill play your game. If your asking if i believe in a god, the answers no. Politcally i dont give a shit, theyre all crooks anyway, thats why they want the power over people. As long as the democans and the republicrats leave me the fuck alone, i couldnt give a shit. Hobbies? I workout with weights 3 days a week, run 15 miles a day, and masterbate 7 days a week. Do i pass?"

Walt, and Billy both chuckled. Billy said, "Relax, John. Im not interrogating you. I dont know you from Adam, mate, Im just trying to get to know you a little better is all."

John chuckled at that, "Billy cut the shit. I know youve probably run a background on me by now, you wouldnt meet up with me if you didnt. I know theres more to this than meets the eye, but i dont give a shit as long as the pay is high. If youve run a BG on me, then you know every few months it seems like i drop off the grid. I move around, pop up in new places. Im not running from anything, ive just got gypsy bones, and I get tired of most people. I dont ask questions, and I only look into the people that have a personal interest in my life, otherwise I could give a fuck about anyone, their views, or their opinions on any damn thing. Can I talk to rich people? Yes, rich people are easy, they look out for their own best interest, I have the same views that most of them have, as long as I know what im selling, and they pay me, I will be of service when im needed, and mind my own fucking business when im not. Anything else?"

Billy smiled, "John, Ill call you in 3 days, dont ignore the call." They shook hands, and John walked out.

When Billy, and Walt walked out of the house, they spoke quietly for a few minutes, shook hands, and then got into their respective vehicles, and left. Billy travelled north to his condo just outside of Chino. As he opened his door, he called out to his wife, and kids "Hello, guys. Papa is home." His kids were sitting at the dinner table, but came running as he rounded the corner into the living room. "Hey guys, how was your day?" He hugged his kids, went and kissed his wife in the kitchen. "Dinner's done honey. How was work today?" He went back to the living room, hung up his keys, and started taking his shoes off for the shoe rack, "Work was work, but it was good. Missed you guys though. Ill be right back, I need to run up to the office and send a couple emails real quick, and then ill be back downstairs for dinner, sweetie. Go ahead and get yourself, and the kiddos fed. Itll just be a few minutes."

Billy jogged upstairs, turned into his office, closed his door, and plopped into his computer chair. He double checked that his door was still closed, and took his memory card out of his suit pocket, and put it into his computer. He saved the files, wiped the memory on the card, locked the files into the secure drive, and closed his computer.

He went into his bedroom, changed into some shorts, and a comfy shirt, and dialed a number on his phone. It picked up on the second ring, "Yes?"

Billy," Hey its me. Ive got 2 ready, can handle 2-4 at a time. Can start immediately."

"Very good, Ive got 6 clients ill send to you immediately. 2 days."

John put the lamphone down, and stopped the recorder. His data gathering appeared to just be getting into gear. He had alot more questions.

3. Wolves in sheep clothing

Tuesday June 9th 2022

After another day of cutting hair, hot towel treatments, and banter; John drove home with the window down, and the sun, and wind on his face. He smoked a rare cigarette, and listened to some Metallica. All in all it was a decent day, not a single flashback. He pulled into the driveway at 8:30, went inside, and headed straight for the shower. After toweling off, getting dressed, he threw a salad together, and turned the t.v. on. This time, instead of netflix he turned on his hardrive , activated his VPN, and address spoofing software. He opened his TOR browser, and started writing an information wanted post, and posted it on a targeted, seemingly random thread on the dark web, and waited for an old friend to get back in contact, with all the info he needed on one Billy Turner. and Walt Montgomery.

Billy called John at 10pm. The gig was on.

Saturday, June 14th 2022

John showed up to the condo 4310 at 8am, opened up the property, plugged in the scented oil warmers to make the property smell fresh, and then he waited for his clients to show up at 8:45. The property had been stocked with food the day before, everything was set up, and ready.

At 8:43 a black limousine pulled into the parking lot, and a man in an expensive suit got out, and opened the back door. Out stepped a man in a much more expensive looking suit, an old cane with a wolf head handle, and fancy sunglasses.

John walked out of the front door, and stood on the steps to await his client. He had dressed in the Armani suit given to him by Billy. "Good morning, I assume you are Mr. Sinclaire?"

The man approached him in an unhurried gate, and smiled, "I am Harrold Sinclaire, yes. And you are?"

John shook his extended hand, "I am Bill, Bill Hansen. Welcome to The Overlooks of Lago Serrenos, Mr. Sinclaire."

John showed Mr Sinclaire every room, let him know the place was stocked with food, and suggested a few nice restaurants. He gave Mr Sinclaire a business card with his number, and asked him if he needed anything else.

Mr Sinclaire smiled, "Actually, Mr Hansen, I would like you to pick up my daughter from the Airport. After that, there should be nothing more I need from you, sir." Mr Sinclaire handed John a printout of the flight number, boarding number, and a picture of a young girl who couldnt have been over 8 years old. The name on the page said the girls name was Nina Sinclaire. She would be arriving at the Chino airport at 10:30am.

John smiled, and said "Of course, sir. I will be right back with your daughter."

After shaking hands, and handing Mr Sinclaire the keys, John turned, walked to his car, and drove away.

While sitting in his car, waiting for the right time to go into the airport, a call from a Texas number. He answered immediately. "Hello."

A gruff voice with a heavy southern twang answered, "Killer one, this is Gunney. I have the info for you."

John grunted, "Okay Gunney, send it to this email, [ucuser762@gmail.com](mailto:ucuser762@gmail.com), and erase everything after. Ill send you payment via the regular means, if you have the same payment info?"

Gunney, "From what Im sending you, ive agreed to do it for free. Youll see what I mean. Over, and out. Its good to hear you again, old buddy. Keep your powder dry."

The call ended, and John checked his email. William Joseph Turner, aka Billy Turner. Convicted sex offender, arrested for fraud, and embezzlement, but those charges were dropped. Convicted sex trafficker, convicted for 6 counts of sexual assault on a minor, possession of child pornography. All records had been sealed, even though he was 28 when he got arrested. Luckily Gunney could still access the files. He was glad Gunney didnt charge him, that would have been expensive.

He looked at the picture of Nina Sinclaire. "Daughter my ass."

He walked into the airport. When he saw Nina being escorted by a flight attendant, he stepped up and asked, "Ms. Nina Sinclaire?"

The little girl nodded meekley. She looked terrified. John knelt down to be eye level with her. "Nina, my name is John. I am here to pick you up, okay?" Nina nodded her head, she didnt look as terrified, but she was still scared. He grabbed her hand, and they started walking towards the front doors. Once they got to the car, John unlocked the rear of the car, and opened the door for Nina. She jumped in, and he closed the door, walked around to the drivers side. He opened the door, got in, and started the car.

John turned in the seat, and looked at Nina. "Nina, your last name isnt really Sinclaire is it?" She didnt answer, she just looked out the window, avoiding his eyes. John said, "Listen sweetie, I will not let anyone hurt you, do you understand me. But I have to know the truth, the truth Nina. Is Mr Sinclaire really your daddy?"

Nina was quiet, thinking. Finally she turned, and met Johns eyes. "Mr Sinclaire is a bad man. My name is Jessica, not Nina. The bad man, said I have to come here, so I can see my Mommy, and Daddy again. I have to make believe Im his daughter." Her eyes started watering. "He said if I told anyone, he would hurt my mommy, and daddy. Please dont let him hurt my mommy, and daddy."

John sighed, "No one will hurt you, or your mommy, and daddy, Jessica, do you understand me?" Jessica nodded, and wiped her eyes. "John sped out of the parking garage. "Im taking you to a friend, okay?"

He speed dialed a number in his phone as he drove, "Heather, this is John. Can you do me a favor?" The voice on the other line replied, John said, "Okay, ill be there in 10 minutes. Ill need you just to watch my niece for me for a few hours. Shes 8 years old, her names Jessica. Just let her watch Netflix, and make sure she eats. I should be done by midnight. Thank you Heather, I owe you one."

6 minutes later John was screeching into Heathers drive way. He got out, and opened Jessica's door. They had gone over Jessica's cover story on the way there, and she was in a much better mood, even smiled as she walked up to Heather's front door.

5 minutes later, John was screeching out of Heathers driveway.

Saturday, June 14 2022 3:00pm

Billy walked into his condo, greeted his wife, and kids, hung his keys up, and put his shoes on the shoe rack. He gave his wife a peck on the cheek, and headed up to his office. He closed the door, and logged onto his computer. This time when he plugged the memory card into the hardrive, he felt a needle slide into his neck, and the world went dark.

Several Hours later he awoke. He was plastic wrapped to a plastic covered metal gurney, with his mouth gagged, and sheets of plastic draping everything he could see, which wasnt much because it was dark. Something moved in the darkness.

"Hello? Is anyone there?" is what he tried to say, but it came out sounding like ,"Hmmmhmm Hmmmhmmhmmmmhmmmhmmhmm?"

A bright light flashed on, blinding Billy so much so that it took him several moments for the shadows to clear. When they did, he saw someone dressed in a dark green rain poncho, with a black mask obscurring the face, a hood over the head, and a cooks apron with "I love the Hunt" printed on it in big bold letters. "Hey Billy, remember me?"

Billy tried to speak, but then remembered the gag. For a moment he thought John would take out the gag, until he felt the knife enter his chest, and pierce his heart.

After Billy stopped shuddering, John walked out of the plastic flaps of one room, and into the next. Harrold Sinclaire was trying to scream through his gag, his face was turning almost purple. John punched him in the face to shut him up, and cut his gag off his face, slicing a hole all the way through Harrold's right cheek. "Oops", he said. "Now, I want to know everyone involved Sinclaire, and I want to know now." Harrold spit blood, aiming off to the left, only achieving spitting it onto his plastic wrapped shoulder. "Go fuck yourself, I dont know what youre talking about." John smiled, and didnt hesitate to cut off his left pinkie toe. Sinclaire screamed, but offered no informations, so John started sawing at the next toe. Harrold started sounding like a mix of a screaming woman, and a jack rabbit in the death throes, "Aaaaaaaagh alright, alright, alright. Please, no stop. Ill tell you anything, ANYTHING." John stopped sawing for a moment, but didnt remove the knife. "Talk." Harrold had started slobbering all over himself, but he talked, and talked, and talked.

When John was satisfied that Harrold had told everything he knew, John went back to sawing. Sawing through toes, and sawing through fingers. He had to put the gag back in because of the damned screaming was giving him a headache, and he had to pause and cauterize the wounds every so often when Harrold passed out from the pain, but it wouldnt be long, and Harrold would be awakened again, and the blood would flow. John didnt want to be too lenient, after all Harrold liked to hurt children. So John would get their vengeance for them, and once John got their vengeance for them, maybe John wouldnt feel like such a monster. At least he was a useful monster, and to John, that was reasonable enough.

When all the body parts had been ground to pulp, and the pulp was bagged, and then plastic wrapped. John loaded it all up and took a trip to Sunset beach.

On the way back, he called Heather, and told her he was running 30 minutes late. "How was Jessica?"

"She's an angel, John. It was no trouble at all, dont sweat it. Ill see you at 12:30"

After picking Jessica up, they drove to Johns house. He opened the pull out bed, and got her some blankets, and pillows. "Goodnight Jessica, tomorrow I will take you home okay?"

Jessica looked at him, "What about Mr Sinclaire, and his friends?"

John looked back at Jessica, "You will have no more problems with Sinclaire, or any of his friends, sweetie. That is a promise, okay? Get some sleep."

Monday June 16th 2022

John opened up the shop early, and got everything set up. He hung up the open sign, and he waited for Walt.

At 9 am Walt walked in, and John greeted him as he always did. Walt smiled, and said " Good morning John, you ready for the next job?"

John smiled back, and replied, "You have no idea."

At 9:30 the police barged into the barbershop, and rushed both John, and Walt.

John was pushed back as the police tackled Walt, and put handcuffs on him. "Walter Montgomery? Freeze youre under arrest for the murder of Harrold Sinclaire, and William Turner."

Walt looked incredulous, "Wait what? No, theres been some kind of mistake, I didnt murder anybody!"

One cop spat at him, "Save it dirt bag, we have hair follicle DNA, linking you to both crimes, you piece of shit. Youre going away for a long time."

As Walt looked at John with a pleading look, John winked at him.

August 17 2022 5:00 am

The CEO of Maxwell Enterprizes, Thomas Maxwell came out of his house, heading for his BMW.

As he opened the door, and got in the drivers seat, he felt the needle slide into his neck. He had time to mumble a weak, "Hello?" before he slouched in his seat, unconscious. John smiled at his new client.

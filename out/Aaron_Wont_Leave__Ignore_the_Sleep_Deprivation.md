It's been three days. I've been without sleep for three days. I just want to go to bed, but I can't. Every time I close my eyes, the noises start again. It's him. Her. It. I don't know what it is, but my sick mind has jokingly decided to name it Aaron. Aaron has been around for a week or so. Aaron has become a nuisance in my apartment. Aaron likes to move things occasionally, misplace items, scratch at my doors and hide under my bed. Aaron is my own personal boogeyman. And I want it gone.

Everything was fine when I first settled into my new apartment last month. I was doing great. There were no weird noises at odd hours, no missing items and no sleepless nights. I was perfectly fine. Then Aaron came along. Living in my apartment. Not even paying the rent. The nerve. I can't tell anyone about Aaron - I'd sound absolutely insane. So I'll just share my experiences with this entity here. Hell, I'll turn this post into an occasional journal entry.

The first time I ever noticed Aaron's existence, or acknowledged it, was whenever my sink randomly creaked on. I knew I hadn't done it. I would never recklessly waste water like that. Aaron had been slowly rearranging things before, but I dismissed it as me being careless. But the sink really snapped me into reality. Sinks just don't randomly turn on. I don't think. I mean, my apartment isn't luxurious enough for touchless faucets. This occurrence kept me on my toes for the better part of the day, before I finally calmed down and went to bed. With the lights on. I have an entity in my flat. A creature. A possible demon as my roommate.

Now fast-forward to today:

Day 6 (The day this post was made)- I'm currently lying in bed. The lights are on. It's six minutes to 10pm. Aaron is scratching at my bed frame. I've told it to be quiet twice already. It won't listen. What a rude guest. I've looked under my bed a few times. Nothing but shadows. Earlier today, before I left for work, Aaron turned my TV on. I laughed a bit. It chose Fox News. Hey, I'd rather listen to Tucker Carlson than have my microwave explode again. I should probably look into getting one of those special priests that come in and bless the evil out of your home. That would work on Aaron. It's pretty evil. It even tried to kill me a few times. The first time was sorta funny. It slipped the soap into my shower. I might've actually gotten seriously injured if I didn't notice it. Good try. Then, it threw a knife at my head, thank heavens for it's poor aim. It hit the thud with a loud wall. No. Wait. It hit the wall with a loud thud. Sorry. I'm putting all my energy into avoiding typing errors right now. Aaron's getting louder. I think I'll call it a night (or try to). Update soon.

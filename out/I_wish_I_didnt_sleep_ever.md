About 8 years ago me and my family, mother, father, two brothers, and our family dog beans. Decided to take a visit up to South Dakota (We live in Arkansas.) My best friend and her family lives there and they are like family to us, so we wanted to visit them as a surprise for her father’s birthday, given my father and her father are very close. On my moms side of the family the girls were known for doing something in there sleep. But I haven’t figured out mine yet which is weird, but my mom started sleep packing,(that’s what she does.) and that’s how we decided to go.


We spent a total of 6 weeks there and absolutely loved it, so much we decided to move there. My oldest brother was completely against the idea. He only has friends in Arkansas and he was even more angry at me because I was the one of suggested it. I don’t have any friends in Arkansas so i was overly thrilled at the idea of it. We sold our house in Arkansas and bought a duplex that my best friends family also moved to.


We had been living there for 1 year before the first weird thing happened. On the 11th of may our family dog beans went missing, and was found outside my youngest brothers window, dead with foam coming out of his mouth. This absolutely broke my youngest brother because he was the closest with beans and slept with him almost every night, i mean it was practically his dog. We gave him a funeral and that was the end of it for a year.


One night the next year on October 19th everyone was gonna meet in our duplex and have dinner, we did that once a month. My parents called us for dinner and we went to the dinner table with my best friends family. Everyone but my little brother came, we thought oh he’s probably just using the bathroom. 5 minutes went by and we started joking that he was probably constipated and taking a poo, then 20 minutes went by and we decided to go check on him. I will never forget what I saw when I opened the bathroom door.(which was shared with my oldest brother.)There where bruises all over his dead body that a been drowned in the bathtub. 


One year later in august we were all watching tv, my family and my best friends family, when we decided to call it a night and go to sleep. That night I remember having this god awful dream about my little brothers death except i was killing him.i have always had bad dream like this so it was normal for me but I just started crying, sobbing even. I woke up to my mom screaming bloody murder. I ran out my room had tears in my eyes still. I stopped running when I got to the living room my older brother was dead, he had a plastic bag over his head and scissors through his stomach. I was mortified. The police question people in our duplex and arrested my best friends dad. I don’t know why but they did


Another year later on may 11th, the day 3 years ago my dog went missing my best friend went missing and was found under the bed that belonged to my best friends mom. My mom of course kicked her out and two days after I was in the kitchen and my mom came in and said that my father left her because she was sleep packing and packed his car keys and sold them. When I went back to bed  I had that dream again but I was killing my best friend instead of my brother. I woke up in a sweat over my dead and cold mothers body, with blood all over myself. 


I think I finally figured out what I do in my sleep.

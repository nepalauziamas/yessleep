“I have your eight-year-old son tied up next to me. Do exactly as I instruct, or I will slowly remove all of his skin with a potato peeler.”

I suddenly didn’t give a shit about my Pumpkin Spice Latte, and I dazedly backed away from the counter without retrieving my credit card.

“*Daddy!*” Oliver screamed from the other end of the line. 

A parent knows how to discern each type of his child’s scream. 

This one was “genuine terror.” 

It was all I could do to keep the phone from tumbling out of my trembling hand. “What do you want from me?” My body rattled; I had unknowingly backed up against the wall.

“There is a woman in a red blouse standing next to her stroller outside.” His voice was deep, gravelly, confident.

I whipped around, praying that the woman in red would not be there.

She was there. Standing next to her stroller, she was focused on the cell phone that she held in front of her.

I decided to lie. If I couldn’t see her, *he* couldn’t control me. “I can’t… there’s no woman in red outside,” I protested feebly. 

“If you’re going to lie, Mr. Warrington, don’t *stare* at the lie while you speak. It sets off a dozen verbal cues.”

I began to hyperventilate.

“We have a request, Mr. Warrington,” the voice continued. Before I could question it, Oliver’s voice came on the line. He was gasping. 

“Please, Daddy. Do what they say. It will be simple. Please do what they say, Daddy.” He started to cry. “Pleeeease.”

He hadn’t called me “Daddy” since he was five. 

My heart broke in several places.

The other voice suddenly came back on. “Take the baby from the woman’s stroller. Run.”

The line went dead.

A person really is nothing more than a list of completed choices.

I had to decide *very* quickly what choice I was willing to live with.

That’s how I found myself sprinting toward the woman in red.

With her face buried in whatever app held her attention, it was extremely easy to snatch the child *oh God it was a newborn* and run away.

I judged her for how long it took to hear a scream.

The world got bendy. The blood rushed in my ears. The woman in red kept shrieking. The sidewalk bounced as I ran. Honking. More screaming. Crashing, *violent* crashing, trying to keep my balance and failing, cradling the baby as I hit the ground. 

Dust.

And a car alarm.

I looked down at the baby in terror. 

He squinted, extended his arms, and produced the tiniest, mightiest wail that he could muster. I smiled wide enough to rip my face in half. *I hadn’t killed the kid.* 

But what almost had?

I looked blearily upward.

A crumpled white BMW was lodged into what remained of the Starbucks wall. One wheel still spun, but the bloody arm that dangled from the ruined passenger window was entirely devoid of life. 

But where was the woman in red?

The phone rang. I picked it up immediately.

“She’s alive, but is buried beneath the rubble. Far better than she would have been otherwise,” the voice explained calmly.

It was only then that I checked where she had been standing.

Angry black tire marks were drawn 62.76 feet across the sidewalk. They marked a straight line of destruction that led across a line of opposing traffic, scraped *right where she had been standing,* and led directly into the shattered mess of a coffee shop.

“Well go find her, you idiot. What’s the point of saving a life if you’re just going to leave her to die afterward?”

The hyperventilation kicked right back in. I tried with everything I had to control it.

I partially succeeded. 

“Are you-” *heave heave* “did you just save us all? Or-” *heave heave* “-just tell me if your intentions are good or evil.” 

For the first time, there was a significant pause on the other end of the line.

“Good and evil are curious things, Mr. Warrington, and rarely understood by those who claim to practice them.”

I had no response to that.

“Now. Find the woman. Reunite her with the baby. You need to get ready for what happens next.”

He paused briefly.

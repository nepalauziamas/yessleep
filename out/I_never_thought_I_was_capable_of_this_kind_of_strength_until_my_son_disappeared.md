He was quiet at first, but slowly melted onto the table, silent sobs shaking is frail body. His attorney took him by the shoulders, gently but firmly, and forced him to stand, to be a man about this. I imagine that the attorney was at his wit’s end; anyone worth his salt would have told their client to take a plea deal. My testimony was just too convincing. I don’t know why he insisted on claiming his innocence when no one was going to believe him.

He finally turned around to face his wife in the row behind. She shook her head before he opened his mouth.

“Please don’t make this harder than it already is, Clarence,” she begged in a quaking voice. “There’s no point in me waiting for you if you’ll never come home again.”

He stared at her swollen belly, his mouth gasping like a fish. “Will – will I ever meet him?”

She was on the verge of tears. “In a prison visiting room?” She turned away and took in a deep gasp. “I’m *begging* you not to make this any harder, Clarence. Please. *Please.*”

His jaw fell open, and I stared in awe at two people breaking in such fundamental ways that they would never heal, never be whole again.

“At least – just tell me one more time that you believe me. That I would – I’d *never* hurt – would never *kill* - a child, no matter what that woman says.”

A chill ran through my stomach as he pointed at me without turning his head. 

“Just let me know that our son will grow up knowing the truth about my innocence.”

She balled her hands into fists and looked at the ceiling, blinking furiously. “Clarence, my son will never know your name.”

“I told the whole courtroom that Clarence Dickinson killed my son.” I spoke into the phone without emotion as I stared around at my living room. Everything was in its place, but it didn’t feel like home. Not anymore. Picture frames and furniture are nothing more than assembled bits of broken wood, dead things that we collect so that we can feel alive. It’s easy to take for granted the assumption that human connection will bind us to the rituals we choose to believe create a home.

“Did he break?” crackled the voice on the other end of the line.

“Yes. Both he and his wife. Their unborn child will grow up without a father.”

The voice groaned in ecstatic pleasure as he swallowed his spit. I could hear a rhythmic stroking sound coming through the speaker.

But I didn’t hang up. I’d learned long ago not to make such a mistake. After listening to him for several seconds, I risked a question. “The jury believed every word I said. It took a *lot* to keep a straight face. Do… do I get credit for that?”

“Good girl,” he gasped as the sounds grew stronger.

“I mean,” I pressed, wiping a tear, “now that I’ve done everything you’ve asked-” My breath stopped for a moment. “You promised to release my son back to me.”

For several moments, I could only hear his breathing getting faster.

“Please-”

“I delivered the information nineteen minutes ago,” he interrupted. “I slid them under your front door.”

I nearly fell over, but forced myself to stay calm for my son. I’d waited thirteen months to get him back, and if the path to salvation was now under my front door, I had to keep a clear head. 

The envelope was sitting there, just feet from where I’d been on the couch. I snatched it up with shaking hands, silently promising him that I would save him soon, that all of the lies and pain were finally about to pay off, that every broken home along the way was worth the price of protecting my little boy.

I tore open the seal to pull out a single photograph.

It was my son, lying decapitated on the floor.

“He’s been gone a week, there’s nothing you could have done,” the voice moaned before [hanging up](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

I was in the middle of brushing my teeth when I got a text from my friend Dave "Dude did you see that William was found dead in a ditch with 12 stab wounds". I was shocked because yes, I didn't like the guy but know deserves this. I texted Dave back " Do they have any clues on who did it?"

"No evidence was found" I didn't know what to think so I finished brushing my teeth and finished getting ready. When I got to school it seemed everyone was talking about the murder. I was putting my books in my locker when Dave came out of nowhere "Dude you see how sad Sarah is" I was startled by him and asked, "What about Sarah".

"Well since Sarah's boyfriend is now dead maybe you could go comfort her and you know maybe get lucky". If you didn't know I had a crush on Sarah but even I thought that was a little fucked up. " Dude she just lost her boyfriend I'm not just gonna jump in and become her new boyfriend".

"Come on man, yes I know it's not a great thing to do but this might be your only shot" I didn't have a great feeling about this but thought what the hell what do I have to lose. I thought I would go talk to her in my English class. When I got there I saw she was in the back with her friends comforting her, I took a deep breath and went over to her.

"Hi Sarah I'm sorry to hear about William" she looked at me with a tear in her eye and thanked me. I felt great because the only time she ever talked to me was when she asked for my help with her essay. I told her if she needed anything I would be there for her, and she thanked me before I went over to my desk.

After class, I was packing up and getting ready to leave when Sarah came up to me asking me if I wanted to sit with her at lunch. I was pretty shocked by this that I almost forgot to say yes to her. I was pretty excited because this is the most I ever talked to her.

At lunch, I grabbed my lunch, and when I walked out I heard Sarah call me over to her table and sat down next to her. I didn't know what to say so I just said "So how's your day going" after saying it I knew I shouldn't have said that, so I just sat there quietly and ate my food.

Sarah eventually broke the silence and said "So are you doing anything after school?" I was shocked by this and told her I was doing nothing. She smiled and asked if I wanted to come over, I was shocked by this because I had just started talking to her, and now she wants me to come over I thought I was dreaming. I looked at her and said "Yes" I was excited seeing I would be going to my crush's house.

After school, I followed Sarah into the parking lot until Dave yelled out my name. I told Sarah to give me a second and went over to him. "Dude what are you doing," I told him straight up I'm going with Sarah back to her place "Dude don't you think this is a little odd". I asked him what he meant " You started talking to her today after her boyfriend died and now she's inviting you to her place".

"But you told me to comfort her and how this was my only shot" I then heard Sarah honk her car horn "Dude I'm just saying this is a little odd with how fast things are moving". She honked again and I told Dave I had to get going when I got in the car I tried to apologize for the wait but she didn't seem to care.

The whole ride there was quiet and when we finally got back to her place I saw it was pretty small. I didn't mind and got out of the car and when I went inside let me tell you it was trashed. There were papers all around and dust she told me her parents were busy with work and barely ever home. I felt bad for her because I thought her home life would be better than this.

She brought me to her room and told me to wait there and she would be back in a second. I sat down on her bed and looked around there wasn't much but I did notice something on her dresser. I walked over and it was pictures of her and William standing next to each other. He had his arm around her and they were both smiling but then I looked at the picture under it and it was her with another guy.

I looked through and they were pictures of different people I had no idea who they were. Who were these people? I thought I was about to walk out until I heard the door open so I sat back down to not look suspicious. Sarah came in not wearing anything but her underwear I was stunned by this. She looked so beautiful with her long flowing blond hair, her blue eyes, and her beautiful smile she slowly walked up to me and sat on my lap " See anything you like" she said sexually.

I smiled and lay back on her bed as we maid out it felt like a dream I was excited until I felt a sharp pain. I looked down and saw she stabbed me in my stomach blood gushing down, it felt like no pain I had ever experienced before. 

She laughed and pulled the knife out I grabbed my stomach as I coughed up some blood. "I see you noticed my photos" she picked one up "Why" I struggled to say. She smiled and looked at me "All you guys are the same you want me for my looks you don't care. All you care about is getting in bed with me so why not take your worthless lives out". She then held up the knife and jumped me I grabbed her and tried holding her back as she screamed.

I struggled to do this with the pain knowing I had to do something I head-butted her nose. She went back grabbing her nose I then kicked her in the face and ran out holding my stomach. It was a struggle, I heard her scream but I didn't look back I just kept running and got out and even there I didn't stop when I got out.

I suddenly started to feel lightheaded and eventually blacked out. I woke up in a hospital bed I was confused until a police officer came in asking me if I was alright. I asked him what happened and he told me I was found in the middle of the round bleeding out. I eventually remembered everything and told them about Sarah and her boyfriends. They thanked me and left.

A week later they came back to the hospital and told me that when they visited the house Sarah hadn't been there but they found her parent's courses in their room. Both their throats had been slit, I was terrified thinking that if I hadn't gotten out I could have been her next victim even worse the police never found her. 

After getting out of the hospital I decided to play on my computer until I got a call from an unknown person. I decided to answer " Hello who is this" I froze when I heard Sarah's voice " Hi Mark you miss me".

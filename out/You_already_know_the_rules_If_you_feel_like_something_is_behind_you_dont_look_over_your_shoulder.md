[When I wrote yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ec5bbp/you_already_know_the_rules_sleep_with_your_feet/) about never sleeping with your head towards a door, I admit, I was honestly a little overwhelmed by all the comments and positive responses. I'm glad I've helped so many people stay informed and stay safe, though I hope I haven't scared you off Edinburgh - it's a beautiful city! 

A lot of you mentioned the rules about spaces behind you. Don't look in mirrors in dark rooms, don't look over your shoulders at what might be following you, don't rush or act afraid when you sense something behind you, and so on. So I thought I'd write something about those rules, to help explain, and to help deter the few of you who think you'll go around glaring defiantly behind you as if you can prove me wrong.

(You KNOW you can't do that. You know how strong that instinct is, that you shouldn't look, and you know that nobody told you - you got it from somewhere deep within you.)

It's convenient, because this is also the story of how I met George. 

I was - I'm just going to be honest with you - out late at night, mildly tipsy, buying a deep fried Mars bar. For those who don't live in regions where this exquisite cuisine is possible, you're just going to have to believe me that it's good. It just is. Moving on. I left with my battered prize and was about to sink my teeth in when I saw him.

A young man, dark haired, coat turned up against the cold. I approved of the coat, and his sensible woven scarf.

I saw him throw a look over his shoulder as he passed. I didn't approve of that so much.

And then I saw his shadow become ever so very slightly larger.

*Fuck.*

I knew about the Thing Behind You, even back then. I wouldn't have been allowed to do this job without at least *some* preparation. But I'd never seen it hunt in real time before, never been the bystander as it got started.

If I called to the young man, would that make him look again? If I followed him, that *definitely* wouldn't help. Fuck. I didn't know him, but I couldn't just let this happen. 

I made a snap decision and broke into a sprint. I'd circle round the hill and meet him on the other end of the street. It'd been raining, and my feet slipped a little over the cobblestones, the cold air rushing into my ears for an instant headache. I needed to be in *front* of this guy.

I saw him again as he hurried round a corner and threw another anxious glance behind him.

"You've got to stop doing that," I called out.

Dude looked at me like I was crazy, glanced at me, glanced behind him, and then back at me. "Are you talking to me?"

A pipe was dripping water into the gutter at the corner of the square. Each droplet stood out to me in the darkness, tiny pearls gilded by reflected lamplight. I don't know what George was hearing, but I could tell the rhytmn of that drip wasn't entirely natural. Dripdrip, drip, dripdripdripdrip. Pause. Dripdrip, drip, dripdripdripdrip. 

"Yes, and I need you to stop looking behind you." 

After a moment's thought, I added, "Because there's nothing behind you."

The shadow shrank just a little bit. I hadn't practiced this - I'd *never* done this before - and my facial expression must have given it away, and the young man noticed. His shadow grew, and this time it wasn't a subtle difference, it wasn't one of those imperceptible differences that you only pick up on if you're me. It looked like someone was shining a torch right under his feet, to cast a shadow that big.

The shadow loomed up on the crescent behind George, broken up by the shapes of Edinburgh's typical tall windows and cut off just at the neck by the dark tiles of the roofs. 

"*You're* looking behind me," he accused, but he didn't turn around. That was good. I approved of that. Sensible scarf boy might have forgotten the rules, but at least he could see it once I reminded him.

I made a series of rapid plans in my head, all discarded. It was imperative that he calm down. It was absolutely imperative that he didn't look behind him. I needed him not to see that shadow, at all costs. I would've been more than happy to blind him, but I wasn't entirely sure how to achieve that from a distance with the two pens, keys and a phone in my pockets, and I sure as hell wasn't chancing a wrestling match.

Trying somehow to look as though I was both non-threatening and a total professional, I skipped the last few steps to the dark-haired man, grabbed his arm and started down the street. I was almost surprised when he complied, but then I looked over at him. Now I was closer I could see the tears in his eyes. 

"You *know* what's behind me," the man accused in a whisper.

"I do," I admitted, "and it feeds on fear, so I need you to *stop thinking about that*. I want you to think about the fact I'm taking you to a safe place. I want you to think about, uh, deep fried Mars bars." I realised as I said it that I still had the damn thing in my hands, and offered him a bite. He accepted, trembling. "I'd like you to focus on telling me your name and what you'd like to make for breakfast tomorrow."

We were walking briskly and I had a grip on his forearm that was a little too hard. I shifted it to his shoulder.

The thing behind him was substantial enough now that it was casting its own shadow. I prayed he didn't notice. I couldn't make out much from the shadow, but it looked like it had a pretty long knife. 

"George," was all he offered in response. I suppose that is fair, given how terrified he was.

"Okay, George. We're going to - fuck it, my place is too far. We're just going to pop into the library. That's a couple streets over."

There were three sets of footsteps on the cobblestones. I hurried mine along, wanting to make sure George didn't notice. Kept up a patter of completely meaningless talk. The thing behind George's knife got longer. The relief when I saw the light spilling from the front door of my local library absolutely drenched me. 

I kept a steady brisk pace up to the front door, shoved George inside and shut the door behind us.

It was only a glass door. It wouldn't hold. I drew George further into the library, found a chair I could position in the corner, and made sure he had his back to two walls before we relaxed. 

Both of us were breathing hard in the sudden quiet.

"That was one of the other you just handled for me, wasn't it?" 

I froze. George wasn't supposed to be asking about that. Why would he know about that?

"It's okay," he reassured me. "I'm a guardian too. Just, I kind of inherited it, and I don't know what I'm doing yet."

So I told him the rules. Not to ever, ever look behind him if he's on a dark street like that. If it's targeted you once, you're more vulnerable.

I told him how it progresses. At first it's your shadow. If you don't believe in it, it's not strong enough to do much, or to hurt you.

But when you glance behind you, and perhaps you see a leaf stirring in the wind or an oddly shaped shadow, it lends just a little credibility to the idea that maybe there could be (or could have been) *something there*.

That little bit of belief is enough to give it power. Still not enough power to hurt you. Still not enough to take physical form, even, but enough perhaps to change the way a water pipe drips or nudge the air to blow a little differently. You think you hear something behind you, so you look over your shoulder again.

That little bit of extra belief still won't give it physical form. But it can nudge things. It could make the air feel warmer on your neck. It could make the street seem quiet, too quiet. It could lengthen your shadow, so that if you turn around and glance at it, something might *seem off*. You believe something is off - something is dangerous. Perhaps you believe, a little bit, that there might be something behind you. It gets stronger.

I told him all this before realising I had made a terrible mistake. 

Have you ever read, or told, a story that scared you so hard your eyes watered from the sheer mental strain of it all? Like your fear was leaking in liquid form from the nearest outlet? 

I'd made sure George had his back to a wall. I hadn't done the same for myself. And my tears were blurring my vision. I wiped them away and noticed George was a little more scared than I'd expect from simply hearing about a monster, at least from a guardian.

"Is there something behind me?" I asked in the most measured, calm voice I could possibly summon.

"Absolutely not."

A *book* fell on my head.

"There is definitely nothing behind you."

I could feel the breath on my neck, just as I'd mentioned it. I wished I hadn't used that example. I hate breath on my neck.

"Please, look at me." I think in hindsight George's nurse training kicked in. I looked at him, tried to actually stop scanning the empty library aisle for anything to help and looked at him. Right into his eyes. He had, has, chocolate brown eyes.

"There is absolutely nothing behind you. There never has been. You are safe. You are completely safe."

I stood up. There's one last thing you can try, in an emergency. It works best if you trust someone with your life, but George was all I had.

I walked towards him, took his hands and pulled him up. I almost slipped his hands out of mine, they were so sweaty.

"Would you prove there's nothing behind me for me?" I asked, knowing how shitty it was for me to ask. "Could we stand back to back?"

The ordinary nurse who never wanted any of this looked over my shoulder. He visibly flinched. I felt the sensation of someone behind me slipping a knife around, poised in front of my throat.

George closed his eyes and rapidly took two steps past me, directly into whatever was behind me - but there was no sound. I felt his back pressed against mine, trembling. There was no knife against my throat. I reached behind me and held his hands, and we stood like that for a while, breathing in tune, hearts thudding like rabbits, knowing the only things behind us were small or harmless enough for the other to face them for a stranger.

Anyway, that's how I met George.

Of course, I couldn't stop it. The Thing Behind Me got its prey that night, though it wasn't either of us. I saw her that Sunday afternoon, a woman hurrying past on a half-empty street who looked like she'd been thrown out with the trash and not combed her hair since. She was stumbling a little, wearing office clothes, looking like she was late for getting fired. Sleep deprivation was absolutely etched into her face. Far too wrinkled for the age she looked like she should be. 

She didn't even look up or notice us as she stumbled past. She'd probably learned by then. Looking the way the tiredness had made her, people who heard her pleas for help would assume she was crazy, a homeless beggar or a drug addict. I knew better, but I also knew better than to try to save her at this point. 

Right as she almost disappeared from view, she threw a glance over her shoulder. And just as she did, another woman rounded the corner, coming the same way she'd come, so they barely glimpsed each other before the first woman disappeared from view. Younger-looking, prettier since she wasn't a wreck, better dressed - you'd never notice she looked exactly like the first woman. She walked with the most perfectly measured patient step. 

When I blinked again, she was gone.

I check obituaries, always, and coroner's notes and crime reports. Officially, this woman died of some kind of mental illness or drug overdose. She went crazy, that's for certain.

That's good. You're supposed to go crazy when you're sufficiently sleep deprived. It's one of the oldest defences we have. It prevents you being *completely* sure that the thing behind you is what kills you.

So, don't glance behind you when you're hurrying home late at night. You *already know this rule*. You know it for a reason. I'm doing my best to keep you safe. It was risky to write this, and risky to make you believe a little more, so you better have followed all the instructions. Sleep with one side of your bed against the wall. Tell your friends that they shouldn't be glancing over their shoulders, because it'll only make them more scared. And if you get up to use the bathroom and you're still feeling anxious from reading this, DON'T look in the mirror.

Anyway, let me know which of the [other rules you might like me to explain.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eis3it/you_already_know_the_rules_dont_step_on_the_cracks/)

We stopped near the middle of the lake and turned off the motor. Sam and the two Todds left the dock and headed into the woods. The other Gretchen sat there for a minute and then walked over to the dock. She stood there watching us

Gretchen had wrapped her arm up with a towel that had been left on the boat. It had been bleeding pretty bad after Phoebe pulled the thing off of her.

We sat in silent shock for a while on the boat, just floating in the lake. After a while, Phoebe broke the silence.

"How are we getting out of here?" she asked.

"I've got the car keys," I said. If we can make it to the car, we can drive closer to town where we should hopefully be able to get a signal and call for help."

"I think we should park the boat on the other side of the lake. We can hide in the trees while we walk back to the house," said Phoebe.

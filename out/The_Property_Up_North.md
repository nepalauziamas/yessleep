We sat down on the bunk beds and began discussing what we should do next.

"I'm exhausted," said Gretchen. "Maybe we should get some rest and go back out in the morning."

Phoebe nodded her head in agreement. "It was dangerous enough during the dayâ€¦it will be so much worse in the dark," she said.

"I'm good with that," I said. "Why don't you try to get some sleep, and I'll stay up and watch."

"Wake me up in a few hours, and I'll take your place," said Phoebe.

"I'm going to need to step outside for a moment before going to sleep," said Gretchen.

"Me too," said Phoebe. "Too bad there was no bathroom in here,"

"Do you two want to go together so you can watch out for each other?" I asked.

"Yes," said Gretchen. "We'll go behind the cabin."

"Okay," I said. "Shout if you see anything."

They went without incident, and then I took my turn. Once we were all back inside, I locked the cabin door and made sure the windows were closed.

Phoebe and Gretchen went on the bunk beds while I sat at the table and began flipping through the journal.

The first few entries dated over a year ago and detailed a trip to Isle Royale on Lake Superior.

He wrote about seeing moose wandering around near his campsite and hearing the wolves at night.

I flipped through more of the pages. There were more entries about backpacking and camping around northern Michigan and the U.P. It appeared that he traveled solo on his adventures.

Finally, I made it to the section about his current trip. He wrote that he was surprised to see so many dead or dying trees in the state park. On his hikes, he often came across areas where leaves and pine needles covered the ground.

His last couple of entries were fascinating.

*I must have accidentally stepped on some mushrooms during my morning hike. A small cloud of spores was released into the air, and I inadvertently inhaled them. I could not stop coughing when it happened. When I stepped on them, they crumbled into dust, so I didn't see what they looked like. My arms were itchy in the areas that came into contact with the spores.*

*I went back to the cabin and used the outdoor shower to wash off, and there were these weird growths that stuck to my skin. After pulling them off, I laid down and took a nap.*

*I was starving when I woke up. None of the food I brought with me sounded good. Then I heard a noise outside and saw a squirrel running up a nearby tree. I don't know why I did what I did next, but I went out and waited by the tree. When it came back down, I was somehow able to quickly reach out my hand and catch it. I broke its neck and then built a fire and cooked it.*

*I don't know if I zoned out or fell asleep again, but when I came too, there was a small pile of animal bones on the ground near me. I wasn't hungry anymore and felt a little more clear-headed.*

This was the next entry:

*I was starving again in the morning and went right outside. I don't know how my reflexes got so much better. There were so many chipmunks, squirrels, and mice that I was able to catch. I didn't cook them this time; I just ate them right after I grabbed them. At first, this seemed weird, but they tasted good, so I didn't mind.*

*I don't know what is happening to me. Most of the day has been a blur; I must have blacked out. All these thoughts and feelings running through my head are not mine.*

*There are more out there like me. I can sense it. I have to go find them and spread the spores everywhere.*

*This isn't me. I can't fight it. It is taking over. I'm not me.*

That is the end of the journal other than the last page I saw when we first came in here.

It sounds like it took longer for this guy to be taken over than it did for Todd and Sam. I'm guessing he must not have inhaled as much, which is why it took longer.

I wonder how many more people are out there that have been taken over. That massive pile of bones we saw on our hike must mean there are quite a few people.

As I was thinking about how dire our situation was, some noises outside captured my attention.

I quickly turned off the lantern and tried to hear where the sounds were coming from. It sounded like more branches were being broken not too far from here. Then I heard some other noises coming from the other side of the cabin. It was footsteps. And it sounded like more than one person.

I quietly crept over to the bunk beds and gently woke up Gretchen and Phoebe.

"There are some people outside," I said.

Right as I finished talking, the door handle began to rattle. They were trying to get in.

Then the door shook as someone slammed into it. The handle turned again, but the lock continued to hold.

We huddled in the dark together while the people began pounding on the door. We could hear them walking around the cabin to the windows when they stopped pounding on The door.

I saw two silhouettes standing in front of the window by the table. There was no light inside the cabin, so I don't think they could see us. We remained motionless and waited while the figures stood there looking in the window.

After a few tense moments, they finally walked away.

"Should we try to go, or do you think we may be safe now since they couldn't get in?" asked Gretchen.

"I hope it means that they will leave us alone now," I said.

"Let's.be ready in case they come back," said Phoebe. "Did you look through the backpack?"

"Not yet, but I read the journal," I said. I shared the highlights of the entries with Phoebe and Gretchen.

"I wonder how many people have been taken over," said Phoebe. "This isn't a very populated area...but it looks like the spores will spread fast."

Gretchen started going through the backpack. "Hey, I found a flashlight," she said. She turned it on and continued looking. Mixed with the clothes were another flashlight and a multi-tool. A smaller pocket contained some trail mix, Clif bars, and dried fruit.

"There are some face masks here, too," said Gretchen.

"What kind of masks are those?" asked Phoebe.

"KN-95 ones," said Gretchen. "Maybe they'll be good enough to protect us from the spores,"

"Worth a try," I said.

We each took a couple masks to keep in our pockets for when we went back outside.

We emptied out the backpack and only put the food, multi-tool, and flashlight in so it would be light to carry.

"Hey. Look out the window. It is bright out there," said Gretchen.

Bright flickering light through the trees behind the cabin sent shadows dancing around the forest.

"Great, they're burning all the infected wood they were collecting," said Phoebe.

We were staring out at the massive bonfire when a figure walked in front of the window and stared back at us. I jumped back and nearly fell over.

He was holding something in his arms, and we watched as he dropped it in front of him. Soon after, another person came over who was also holding something. He also dropped it around the cabin before going back. Sam stayed and watched us.

"They're putting the wood around the cabin," Gretchen said.

I noticed the flickering light was moving closer to us. As it got closer, I realized it was two more people holding burning sticks.

"Let's put our masks on and make a run for it," said Phoebe.

I grabbed the backpack and the lantern and headed to the door. Todd was standing outside in front of the door.

I turned to look out the window, watching as the two people lit the wood piles on fire. Then they continued around the side of the cabin towards the front.

"We're going to have to push past Todd to get out," I said, ensuring my mask was tight.

"I've got an idea," Gretchen said as she ran to the bunk beds. She grabbed the sleeping bag and unzipped it all the way. "Let's cover up with this."

She ran back to the door, and we all held onto the sleeping bag holding it over us.

The cabin in the back had caught on fire, and I could see smoke out the window by the door.

"Let's go!" I shouted and opened the door. We ran together and knocked Todd over while keeping the sleeping bag over us.

Discarding the sleeping bag, we sprinted down the path away from the cabin. I was hoping it would lead us to the park entrance.

The dirt trail was well-worn and kept us a safe distance from the trees. Gretchen The moonlight provided just enough light for us to stay on the path without resorting to using the flashlights.

We ran along the trail until I said I needed to catch my breath. It didn't sound like anyone was chasing us. I don't know if they gave up or were more focused on spreading the spores with the bonfires.

"I wish we knew how far this trail went. Some of the trails up here could go on for miles and miles," said Phoebe.

"I just hope we can find somewhere to sleep," I said. "I'm running out of steam here."

"Shhh!" said Gretchen. "I think someone is coming."

We got quiet and listened. The sound of shoes smacking against the dirt pathway was unmistakable and getting closer.

"It sounds like more than one person," Gretchen said.

I looked back down the trail after we began running away again but didn't see anyone yet. We could hear them following closely behind us every time we stopped to catch our breath. This went on for a long time, and I knew I wouldn't be able to keep going for much longer. As long as we stayed on the trail, I was certain they would keep chasing us until they got us.

"I think we need to try and lose them in the woods," I said. "I'm not sure how much longer I can keep running."

"Same here," said Gretchen. "Next time the trail curves, let's head into the trees."

"Good idea," I said. My chest was burning, and I could feel my right leg beginning to cramp.

After another hundred or so feet, the trail curved to the left. We followed it around the corner and stepped off the path into the trees. Phoebe led the way and stopped once we could barely see the trail. We all crouched down and waited for our pursuers to pass us by. Less than a minute had passed before two figures went running past us. Once we could no longer hear their footsteps, I was able to breathe a little easier.

"Now what?" I asked.

"I was hoping you would have a plan," said Phoebe.

"I don't think we can go on the trail anymore," said Gretchen. "What if they stop and turn around?"

"If we go through the woods, we might run into more of the infected trees," said Phoebe. "Maybe we should just sit down here and wait it out until morning."

"That might be our best option," I said. Then at least we'll be able to see what we're getting into. If we use the flashlights now, they'll surely see us."

"I don't have any better ideas," said Gretchen as she sat on the forest floor.

We all tried our best to get comfortable on the ground without making too much noise.

"How many spiders and millipedes do you think are crawling around us now?" asked Gretchen.

"Why did you have to say that," said Phoebe. "Now it feels like things are crawling all over me."

It was a long night sitting on the ground. Any little noise had us on edge. Not much was said between us; I'm sure we were all exhausted and still struggling to come to grips with everything that had happened.

My eyes kept closing, and I was drifting off to sleep when a louder noise brought me back awake.

"What is that?" asked Phoebe.

"I don't know," I said. "But it sounds really close.

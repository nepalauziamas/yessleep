We went up north for an end of summer vacation before our last year of college. My friend Sam’s grandparents owned a bunch of land in the upper peninsula somewhat near Paradise that included a nice lake and a cottage, and they were kind enough to let us use it. I was talked into coming here after Jenny broke up with me the day before we were supposed to go on a road trip to Florida.


We had a great time those first two nights. There was lots of laughter, fun, and alcohol. This morning I awoke with a mild headache next to Phoebe in her bed. She did a wonderful job helping me forget about Jenny last night. She was still sleeping so I put on some clothes and headed downstairs for breakfast. 


I looked out the window-filled wall and could barely see the lake through the morning fog. Sam was already in the kitchen eating a bowl of Lucky Charms. He looked up and smiled at me. "Feeling alright this morning? I think we went through half of our beer supply last night."


"I'm sure I'll be good after breakfast." I said as I gathered some eggs, cheese, and bacon for breakfast. "How about you?"


"I've already been for a run around the lake this morning. I’m feeling great. It sounded like you got plenty of exercise last night though." He said with a wink.


"My bad, I guess the walls are pretty thin here. Probably just a one time thing though," I said.


"I wouldn't be so sure of that. She's been waiting for you and Jenny to break up for a while now."


“I’d be happy with a few more nights like last night, but we’ll see where it goes.”  I began making a big breakfast for everyone and enjoyed the peace and quiet of the morning.


A little bit later, Todd and Gretchen came down the stairs and entered the kitchen. “Good morning!” I said.


“I’m surprised you’re awake from all that activity last night,” said Gretchen.


“Oh man, you heard us too,” I said lowering my head.  “Well, maybe a good breakfast will make up for it.”


“Hey, I can deal with that if you cook us breakfast every morning,” said Todd. Gretchen and Todd grabbed plates and silverware for everyone while I finished preparing the breakfast. 


Phoebe came down last. "Nothing better than the smell of bacon first thing in the morning," she said as she walked past me and traced her hand across my lower back.


I dished out food for everyone and we all sat around the table. After some discussion, we came up with a plan for the day. We were going to pack lunches and go for a hike through the woods to explore the property. Then we'd take the boat out for a while and finish the evening with a bonfire. After breakfast we all went our separate ways to get ready for the late morning hike. 


We met up on the deck in front of the lake once we were all ready. It was a beautiful view looking over the private lake surrounded by trees. There was a dock in the water with the small pontoon boat that we had taken out a couple times already. Sam said that his grandparents owned about a square mile of property that ended at a state park, so there was plenty to explore on our hike.


The weather was much cooler than usual for this time of year today so it was a perfect day for a hike. We chatted about what we wanted to do after graduation as we walked through the evergreens and oak trees. Todd and Gretchen were planning on moving to Chicago together. The company Gretchen had her internships with had already given her a job offer that she accepted.  They were looking forward to being able to walk home from the bars and told us to come visit anytime once they get settled. 


Todd looked over at Sam and me and said, "Maybe I’ll take my time finding a job. Then you guys can come over and we can play video games and drink all day while Gretchen works."  This resulted in a smack on the arm from Gretchen.


Sam was planning on staying in Michigan to help his Dad with the sign shop he owned. Before Phoebe or I had a chance to talk about our plans, we came across a large pile of small bones and partially eaten animal carcasses. 


"Ew, that is disgusting," said Phoebe, "what is that from?"


"Birds?" guessed Todd. 


Sam grabbed a large stick and pushed it through the pile. Some of the bones disintegrated and a cloud of dust went into the air. Sam started coughing as he unintentionally breathed in some of the dust. 


"I think I just inhaled a squirrel," he said through fits of coughing.


The rest of us quickly moved away so we wouldn't have to breathe in the dust cloud too.


"You all right buddy?" I asked Sam.


He finally stopped coughing, but seemed to struggle to breathe normally again. "I think so," he said, "but my chest burns when I breathe in."


After letting Sam compose himself, we moved on. There was a thin trail of dead animals and bones that continued on the way we were headed; smaller piles of bones were also scattered here and there. We all thought it was odd, but wanted to continue on our hike.


Soon we came to an area filled with birch trees. "They all look dead." I said and ran over to one with a hearty "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" as I pushed it over. It made a satisfying crack before breaking and falling to the ground.


"Hercules, Hercules!" Shouted Sam, while clapping his hands. Then he walked over to a huge white birch tree.


"No way you're getting that one over by yourself," said Todd. He started walking over to help. Sam pushed on the tree and his hands busted straight through it right as Todd got next to him. This caused the tree to start tipping towards them. They quickly tried moving out of the way, but the tree crumbled like it was made of sand. It knocked them to the ground and covered them and the air around us with a thick dust.


We ran over to help them up and tried not to breathe in the dust. Both of them were fine other than a few scrapes from falling on some rocks. 


"I took a mouthful of it." Sam said as he tried to spit it out. "It feels all fuzzy in my mouth." He grabbed his water bottle and gargled some water before spitting it out.


We all began brushing the dust off our hair and clothes and then tried to help Sam and Todd, who  had gotten the worst of it. They tried to rub it off, but it only served to smear it more across their faces.  


"Let's head back and get cleaned up, I don’t like how this feels in my hair," said Gretchen. "You and Sam look like ghosts with it all over your face."


Everyone was in agreement so we began heading back toward our cabin without stopping for lunch. We went past the pile of dead animals again, but it looked larger than when we first passed by an hour or so ago. 


"That creeps me out," Phoebe paused, "did it get bigger?". She walked closer to me and leaned in to me.


I put my arm around her waist and gave it a little squeeze. "Looks like it. Let's get out of here." 


Our path back must have diverged from the path we took on the way out because we soon came upon a small lake. There were long reeds and cattails around it and it looked a little swampy.


Sam stopped. "I'm going in," he said. "I've got to get this off me. It itches everywhere, I can't take it anymore."


"That water looks disgusting!" said Gretchen. “Why don’t you just wait until we get back?”


"And it is probably full of leeches." Phoebe added.


Sam ignored them and set his backpack on the ground. He took off his shoes and socks, ran into the water, and dove in with the rest of his clothes on.


"He's crazy," Phoebe whispered to me. "That water is disgusting and probably full of bacteria."


I grabbed the extra shirt out of my backpack and used it to brush more of the dust off Phoebe’s clothes and then she did the same for me.


After a few minutes went by, Todd walked closer to the lake. "Hey Sam, hurry up. It is starting to bother me too, let's go back," he said.


I looked back to the lake and looked at the calm water. When he didn’t surface, we all ran toward the water shouting his name. I scanned through the shallow water, but didn’t see him.


“Should we go in?” asked Phoebe?


“Go in where?” Sam said from the left side of the lake. 


There was a moment of silence as I’m sure everyone else was just as confused as I was seeing Sam appear.


The silence was finally broken by Todd; “Where the hell did you come from?” 


Sam just stared at Todd and didn’t respond.


“Hey! I said where did you come from?” said Todd.


Gretchen pulled out a blanket from Todd's backpack and wrapped it around him.  Sam grabbed it and then just stood there like he was waiting for one of us to lead the way.


“Um, aren’t you going to put your shoes back on?” said Phoebe.


Sam looked around and when he saw his shoes and socks, he went over and put them on. After he was ready, we started back to the cabin. “You alright?” I said to Sam.


“Fine. I’m good,” he said. “Let’s just go back.”


I’m sure the cold water had affected him, but I was still weirded out by how none of us saw him get out of the lake.


We were mostly silent the rest of the way back and I kept getting the feeling that someone was watching us. I didn't express this feeling, but I think the others felt the same; I saw them stop and look around at various times on the trip back. 


Sam was struggling to keep up, but I checked on him every so often so we wouldn't lose him.


When we were almost back to the house, I looked back again to check on Sam, but he was gone. I stopped and yelled his name a few times.


"Hey, wait up!" I yelled to the others. "Sam fell behind."


"Can you guys look for him?" asked Todd. "I'm covered in this stuff still and I need to get it off."


"No problem," I said. 


Gretchen, Phoebe, and I walked back and started calling for Sam. We walked for a while back towards the small lake that Sam had jumped in.


"Listen," said Gretchen. "I think I hear someone coughing."


We ran towards the sounds and found Sam sitting on a log just outside the lake.


After he finally finished coughing, he looked up at us and said, "Why did you guys leave me…and where are my shoes?"


"What? We didn’t leave you…you came with us and then fell behind," I said. "Why did you come back?"


"Very funny," said Sam, "you guys were all gone when I came out of the lake."


“Maybe that dust messed with your head," said Phoebe. "Let's just get back to the house.


We stayed together this time, but didn't say much on the walk back. Once we were back inside the house, Sam grabbed a beach towel to dry off and said he was going to lie down for a bit before taking a shower.


"That was weird," Gretchen said. "I'll go check on Todd down here and you two can use the shower upstairs."


"Sounds good," I said.


I followed Phoebe upstairs and said, "You go first. I should go check on Sam and try to figure out what’s going on."


"This is too weird, I don't really want to be alone right now. Besides, I could use a little help making sure I get all this stuff off me." She grabbed my hand and pulled me into the bathroom with her.


She turned the shower on and we carefully took off our clothes, piling them neatly on the floor to avoid spreading the dust. She grabbed my hand again and led me into the shower with her. Most of the dust had been on our clothes, but our hair was pretty covered with it. We took turns scrubbing our faces and washing our hair and then she told me to check her body for any more. I inspected her body closely and rubbed my hands across her smooth skin until I came across a rough patch on her lower back. It felt like sandpaper.


"Did you find something?" she asked.


I looked her over another time and then rubbed the rough patch again. "Just this one spot," I said. I picked at the edge of it. "Does this hurt?" She shook her head no. "Okay, I'm going to try to pull it off." I pulled at one of the edges and it came off like a band-aid. 


She let out a small yelp. "Sorry, did that hurt?" I said.


"Kind of. It reminded me of the first and only time I waxed my legs."


I pulled her over toward me out of the water and looked closely at her back. About a hundred tiny drops of blood appeared on her lower back, like when the doctor pokes your finger to get a tiny blood sample.


"What is it?" she asked.


"You’re bleeding a bit, it must have dug into your skin. I'll put some antibacterial cream on it when we get out." 


"Okay, let's get you checked out now." She said and proceeded to slowly explore my body with her hands. You're all clear...and apparently ready for action.”  She grabbed onto me and started kissing me.  Her tongue felt strangely rough, but I was quickly able to look past that.  


When we were finished, we grabbed our towels and dried off.  I found some antibiotic cream in the cabinet and rubbed it on her back.


A few seconds after I finished, she yelled, “Oh my god! Ow, it burns! Get it off, get it off!” 


She fell to the floor crying. I quickly turned the shower back on and helped her in. I grabbed the soap and scrubbed the cream off as fast as I could.  I helped her get out and dried her off carefully. Her lower back was all red and blisters had already formed. She was still sobbing as I wrapped her in her towel and walked with her to her room.  She laid down carefully in her bed on her side and I told her I’d be back with a cold towel.


A scream brought me down the stairs at a quick pace. I ran over to the bathroom and knocked on the door. "What is it?" I yelled.


Todd opened the door wearing a towel with blood dripping down his face, neck, and arms. Gretchen was standing in the bathtub covering herself with a towel.


"Oh my God, are you all right?" I asked.


Todd grabbed another towel and started wiping the blood off. "It looks worse than it feels," he said.


"Phoebe was bleeding a bit after I pulled one of those things off her back," I said pointing to the pile of moss-like strips on the floor. "Don't put any antibiotic cream on it. I put some on Phoebe and it burned her."


"Sorry for the scream, I didn't expect to see that much blood when I pulled open the curtain," Gretchen said.


More blood began to slowly bubble up on the hundreds of tiny holes poked into Todd's body. 


"What the hell are those things? It just looked like dust when it covered us. I only had some on my hair, but luckily I didn't have any of those things on my body,” I said.


"I don't know, but it hurt like hell pulling them off," Todd said.


"Gretchen, did you get any on you? You know, I could check you over if you'd like," I said trying to lighten the mood. 


"Hey," Gretchen said,"there's a cover charge to see this nice of a show."


“She didn’t have any on her,” said Todd.


"I'll go grab the first aid kit so you can get bandaged up." I said. I went to the kitchen and rummaged through the cabinets.  After locating the first aid kit, I raced back over to Todd and Gretchen and gave it to them. "Remember no antibiotic cream." Todd gave me a thumbs up and closed the door.


I headed back to the kitchen, grabbed a towel and loaded it with ice from the freezer. Then I noticed a wet trail along the floor and over to the stairs. I followed the trail upstairs and saw that it led towards Sam’s room. Before checking on him, I stopped in Phoebe’s room to see if she wanted the ice. She had fallen asleep still wrapped up in her towel. I lifted the towel to look at her back; the blisters had gotten worse and yellow pus was oozing out of them. I covered her back up and then went back into the hallway, closing the door behind me.


I went up to Sam's door and knocked. "Hey Sam, you okay in there?" I said.


No response. I knocked louder this time and raised my voice, "Sam, are you okay?" I grabbed the handle and opened up the door. The handle was all wet. I pulled my hand away noticing the blood on it and then burst into the room, "Sam!" I yelled and looked around. The shades were down and the room was dim. It looked like Sam was lying in his bed covered with a thin blanket staring up at the ceiling. 


"Hey, are you alright?" I asked. He didn't respond and continued to stare at the ceiling.


"Sam!" I yelled.


After another minute, he finally moved and slowly turned his head to look at me. Then he opened his mouth, but didn't say anything.


I took a step closer to the bed and was about to say something when I realized that it wasn't a blanket on him. His skin was covered with fuzzy tendrils that were slowly moving like tiny caterpillars reaching up for a leaf.


His eyes got big and he looked really scared. Then he opened his mouth even wider and  let out a loud burp. I quickly retreated back to the doorway as he vomited out a thick cloud of dust.


I slammed the door shut and ran back down the hallway to Phoebe's room. She wasn't there. "Phoebe," I called out.


The reply I received was a piercing scream coming from the bathroom. I ran down the hallway and pushed through the door to find Phoebe crying and holding onto something by her mouth. When she turned toward me, I saw blood dripping down her chin. She opened her mouth and there was another one of the rough moss-like things partially attached to her tongue. It was much thicker than the one that had been on her back. She tried to say something, but it only resulted in more blood coming out of her mouth. 


“Do you want me to try to get it off?” I asked.


She nodded her head up and down and let go of the growth. I grabbed onto it and started pulling it gently at first. She screamed in pain and shook her head no. She made a motion with her hands that looked like pulling a bandaid off fast. “You want me to pull it fast?” I asked to confirm. She nodded her head again and then grabbed onto the counter for support.


“Okay…one. Two. Three,” I said and then pulled it as quickly as I could. Her head jerked to the side as I pulled and I could feel it getting stuck before it finally came free. Phoebe crumpled to the floor. I immediately felt the thing grip onto my hands.


I tried to shake it off, but it hung on to my hands tightly. It wouldn't let me let go of it. It felt fuzzy on my hands and I could feel it latching on to me. I kept trying to pull my hands apart and was finally able to pull my right hand free. It moved in a wave-like motion on my left hand and looked like it was growing and beginning to split in half. 


I looked on the counter for something to pry it off with and saw the antibiotic cream. Leaning my arm on the tube, I was able to unscrew the cap. Then I squeezed the entire contents of the tube on top of the growth. 


It immediately reacted to it, with bubbles forming on its surface. One part of it was starting to lift off my hand. I walked over to the bathtub, thinking I could scrape it the rest of the way off with the metal faucet. Suddenly it felt like hundreds of needles were stabbing into my hand. I shouted in pain and started scraping it against the faucet.  After quite a few scrapes, it finally came off along with some of my skin. It fell to the bathtub floor and squirmed as the bubbles on it grew bigger. 


I quickly closed the shower curtain and went over to Phoebe. She had stuffed a towel in her mouth to stop the bleeding. 


"Let's get out of here," I said. The bubbles on that thing look like they are going to burst."


I grabbed her hand to help her up and we rushed out of the bathroom, shutting the door behind us.


We stopped at the top of the stairs. Sam was standing just outside his room watching us. I whispered to Phoebe that she should go downstairs. She nodded her head and slowly went down, watching Sam with a concerned look as she went.


I stared back at Sam waiting for him to say something. He didn't look fuzzy like last time and had the same clothes on from when he was in the lake. I waited a very long couple of minutes, but he remained silent. 


I backed down the first couple of stairs keeping my eyes on him. "Sam," I said more to myself than to him. "What the hell is happening to you?"


He didn't say anything, but took a few steps towards me. I went quickly down the stairs and found Phoebe with Gretchen in the living room.


"Where's Todd?" I asked. "We have to get out of here."


"He's resting in our room," said Gretchen.


Sam was moving slowly down the stairs. "Let's grab him and get out of here. I don't think that is Sam coming down the stairs," I said.


Gretchen ran down the hall to their bedroom. I saw our car keys on the kitchen counter and quickly grabbed them before running to the front door with Phoebe.


Gretchen screamed. "Hey, you scared me Todd," she said. 


"Guys, hurry up!" I shouted. Sam was at the bottom of the stairs. Luckily he was moving slowly, but he was only about twenty feet away…and I just noticed that he looked bigger than when I saw him outside his room.


"Todd stop! What are you doing?" shouted Gretchen. 


Just then, the front door flew open and Todd was standing there still wrapped in his bandages.


"Guys, that isn't me!" he frantically shouted. 


Gretchen screamed again and ran into the living room bumping into Sam. A cloud of dust flew out of him and he fell back a few steps. She kept running to us and we all made it outside, slamming the door behind us.


Todd was coughing like crazy and leaning on the railing. 


"I've got to go rinse off," said Gretchen. "That dust got all over me when I bumped into Sam."


She ran down to the lake and jumped off the dock. Phoebe and I followed her with Todd stumbling behind us as he continued to cough.


Gretchen came out of the water holding her arm out to the side. I could see something growing on her arm.


"It won't come off," Gretchen said.


It had grown a lot faster than the other ones had. I figured it may have had something to do with it coming off of Sam, or whatever that was that looked like him, instead of from the trees.


I heard a thump behind me. Turning around, I saw Todd on the ground. He began dry heaving in between fits of coughs.


"This thing is digging into my arm," said Gretchen. "Help me!"


Phoebe had lost the towel during our escape outside and I could see fresh blood on her chin. Everyone was in need of help except me, but I was struggling to figure out what to do next. 


Then Phoebe ran over to Gretchen and began tugging at the growth that had spread across her entire arm.


Todd was convulsing on the ground and I watched in horror as he vomited a large fuzzy growth out of his mouth. It was about a foot long and it immediately slithered across the ground towards the woods and burrowed into the ground near the trees. Todd rolled over on his back and was wheezing and gasping for air.


His mouth was moving like he was trying to tell me something. I cautiously stepped back, afraid he was going to spread dust like Sam did earlier.


Finally, he started making some sounds and in a raspy voice he said, "I'm losing control."


"Losing control of what?" I asked.


His mouth started twitching and his eyes were darting side to side and up and down. He closed his eyes and clenched his fists.


"My mind…it is taking over my mind," he said.


He rolled awkwardly onto his stomach and tried to push himself up, but fell back to the ground.


"I'm not doing this," he said.


Gretchen screamed in pain behind me. 


"Get out of here…and keep Gretchen safe," Todd said. "It wants to hurt you." 


He started trying to stand up again, but fell back down and rolled onto his back.


"Please go now," he said. "I'm not me, I'm not…come over here." 


I backed away further from Todd and glanced over at the house to see Sam and the other Todd walking towards me. Sam was moving faster than before.


"Let's get on the boat," I said. "I don't think we can make it around them to the car.


Phoebe had successfully helped Gretchen get the thing off of her arm. It was motionless on the grass, but looked even bigger than it did a few minutes ago.


"Todd!" Gretchen shouted. "We have to help him!"


"I don't think we can," I said.


Phoebe grabbed onto Gretchen and started pulling her towards the dock. Sam and the other Todd were now running towards us. I looked back when we got to the dock and they were almost to where the real Todd was. Phoebe started up the boat and I went to work unwrapping the rope from the cleats on the dock. 


"Hurry!" Gretchen yelled. "They're going to get us!"


Todd pushed himself up and collided with Sam and the other Todd just as they were about to go past him. A thick cloud of dust flew into the air as the three of them tumbled to the ground. 


I finished freeing us from the dock and pushed off of it while Sam and the two Todds got up and made their way to the dock.  Phoebe pulled the throttle all the way back into reverse, nearly sending me flying off the front of the boat. 


They stayed on the dock and watched us go towards the center of the lake. 


"Who's that?" Phoebe mumbled in a barely intelligible voice. That growth must have really damaged her tongue. She was pointing to a girl who was sitting in the grass 


"That looks like me," said Gretchen.

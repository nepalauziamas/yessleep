This all happened years ago, when the front door started rattling around like an old tooth in a rotten gum. My parents had left me alone even though I was far, far too young, so I told myself it was only the wind and ignored those random thuds and bangs.

But while I played Mario Kart in the lounge, those sounds morphed into a furious THUMP THUMP THUMP so violent I couldn't help but picture an escaped serial killer trying to break in.

I went to go investigate.

As I turned into the landing, those noises tapered off, and by the time I reached the door, only the ankle-height flap was rattling around, because Snoopy, my pet cat, was mashing his skull against the clear screen.

His magnetic collar released the locking mechanism on contact, although this trick usually took some trial and error. I let out a sigh of relief as he leaped onto the welcome mat and licked his front paw. The situation had been a nasty combination of nasty weather and a nine-year-old boy's overactive imagination, that's all.

With my heart rate already climbing down, I pushed the letterbox open to confirm the coast was clear.

At the far edge of the garden, a vague, out-of-place shadow slipped away into the gloom. Quickly I reeled away and launched into full-blown denial mode: maybe it was a trick of the light? Or the squirrel that dug up mom’s rosebushes?

Yeah, that’s it. Another quick scan of the outside street confirmed my suspicions–there was nothing to worry about. Big boys didn’t get spooked by dumb squirrels…

Just then, the kitchen phone screeched, which made me jump up and yelp.

The landing branched off in two directions: left led into the kitchen, right went through to the lounge. Due to the house's odd layout, you could walk in an infinite loop around the stairs.

In the kitchen, I grabbed the cordless phone off the counter.

“Alex, we’re still here with your Gran,” Dad said. “Your mom’s speaking with the doctor now. Is everything okay?”

My parents had enough problems, no reason to tell them a bit of air spooked me. Besides, if they didn’t think I could handle staying home alone, it meant no more unsupervised gaming sessions. “Yeah, everything’s fine.”

“Are the electrics off?”

If anybody left so much as a plug switched on overnight, they received an hour-long lecture courtesy of my father. Although he kept the grizzly details hidden from me, I knew it had something to do with bad wiring, the previous owner, and an electrical fire. “Yep.”

“Good. Listen, we’re at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Ward 5B. You got a pen handy? I’ll call out the number.”

After jotting it down on a scrap of paper I asked him to send Grandma my love.

Before the phone even landed in its cradle, those thuds and bangs started up again, quietening the second I peeked into the hall. I shuffled back to the landing and stood on the welcome mat.

One quick peek. One quick peek through the letterbox so I knew everything was fine, then back to Mario Kart…

I hesitated for several seconds, legs shaky. What if a hand reached through and grabbed my throat? Or what if there was a grinning face staring back at me? The idea sent shivers along my spine.

No, time to man up. I waved the notions aside, hunched over, sighed, then pushed the letterbox open.

A set of eyeballs were right there, inches away from my own. Immediately I reeled away, heart thumping against my chest, and fell against the bottom of the stairs.

Eight bony fingers wormed their way inside the house, propping open the letterbox. Through the narrow slot I saw a pair of eyes–one brown, the other a milky blue with no iris or pupil–and screamed so loud I’m surprised the neighbours didn’t hear, even though they lived a half-mile down the lane.

“Gary let me in,” said a raspy voice.

In a frantic panic, I scrambled into the kitchen where I pressed my back flat against the wall and didn’t move a single muscle, the room shrinking around me. I forced myself to breathe. Every door and window had been locked, every curtain pulled shut. Nobody could break into my little fortress.

“Gary, what’s wrong” shouted the voice. “It’s time to go see Benny.” Whoever it was sounded oddly upbeat.

Working up the nerve to shout back took five minutes. “I’m not Gary.”

Beyond the dim hall, a grinning face pushed right up against the cat flap fogged up the plastic with its clammy breaths, obscuring the features. Whoever it was kept calling for someone named Gary.

I considered calling the police, but reasoned they’d be more upset over my parents leaving their child home alone than a simple case of mistaken address. One of my neighbours friends simply got the wrong house, that’s all. Soon they’d realize their mistake, stop drumming the cat door, and leave.

Sure enough, from the far end of the hall, I heard them stand up and shuffle off, then the house went back to sleep. This time, I didn’t check the letterbox.

The kitchen phone buzzed after three more games of Mario Kart. “You not in bed yet?” Dad asked, sternly.

“I was just about to go.”

“Listen, your mother and I might be here a while. Everything’s okay, isn’t it?”

“...Sure.”

“Grand. Get to bed, call us if there’s any problems.”

At night, the journey upstairs always freaked me out, even without intruders outside. You could only turn the downstairs light out *from* downstairs, which meant flicking off the switch trapped you in swelling darkness, hidden monsters breathing down your neck while you scrambled for the warm safety of the well-lit first floor.

Like always, the gloom closed in on me as I made the mad dash.

In my bedroom, I changed into a pair of pyjamas and–somehow–fell asleep.

Later, the cat flap jolted me awake. That bipolar critter never knew what it wanted to do. While the minutes ticked away on the Simpsons clock beside my bed, the door jiggled about, and since the porch canopy blotted out the space directly beneath my bedroom, I couldn’t get a view of the action.

Snoopy needed help, that’s all.

Just in case, though, I armed myself with a hockey stick before I moved out into the upstairs landing, rounded the banister, and stared down at the bowels of the house, dreading another plunge into the abyss…

At that exact moment, the hatch lowered its voice. “Snoopy?” I called out.

My foot hovered over that final visible step for several seconds, then I darted the rest of the way and flicked the switch before the monsters could snatch me.

And as the bulb overhead blinked on, my blood ran cold. Because now, the cat door lay on top of the welcome mat. The screen and surrounding mechanism had been knocked loose, leaving a gaping wound through which the outside air reached out and nipped at my toes.

Maybe Snoopy pried the thing from its housing by ramming his head against it too many times? That cat did have an *exceptionally* thick skull…

Either way, that hole may as well have been an open invitation to any thieves and murderers. Dad needed to hear about this.

Still armed with the hockey stick, I snatched the phone off the kitchen counter, but as I held it against my ear, the lounge door shivered open several inches.

Wait. Was somebody inside the house, or had my nerves taken over like whenever I ran the upstairs gauntlet?

“Snoopy?” I whisper-shouted into the darkness, slotting the phone in my pyjama pocket. Arms quivering, I shuffled across the room, pushed the door open with the stick, and poked my head inside.

Empty.

Another open door at the far side of the room brought me into the hall, then a right turn brought me back to the landing, where my stomach unclenched.

All clear.

On instinct, I flicked the light switch from the base of the stairs off using the hockey stick (so there’d be less distance to travel), rushed up the steps, and then realized I’d forgotten the scrap of paper with the hospital's number scribbled on it…

Before I could psych myself up to brave the darkened wasteland again, the staircase creaked and groaned. Frozen on the spot, I craned forward to peek over the banister and found myself biting down on a giant scream.

Because there, at the foot of the steps, stood the outline of a figure…

Its head whipped up in my direction, which made the phone slip out of my grasp and tumble out of view. It ricocheted off the steps out of sight as the horrible shape advanced.

Once it reached the halfway point, the bulb illuminated a floating face: lopsided, wrinkled features.  Thin lips twitched over in a wide grin revealing yellow molars, then the figure took another step, and I could see it was a lady. She looked straight at me and affectionately said, “Gary.”

She wore a large trench coach, so long it touched her ankles, and had a stained satchel slung over her shoulder. Glass bottles clinked together each time she climbed another step.

“I’m not Gary,” I stammered, backstepping toward my room.

The lady rose into view and craned her neck sideways, her head at my ankle level between the little wooden bars.

“I—I think you have the wrong house,” I rasped. Part of me believed whoever it was would soon realize this was all a big mistake and leave.

After rounding the stairs and stepping onto the landing, her arms went up as though anticipating a hug. “Come to Mommy.”

I slammed the door shut and held my body against it, my breaths shallow and quick, but the intruder swatted me aside and stepped through.

I planted my feet and swung the hockey stick in a fierce arc; it hit the lady’s right temple so hard vibrations travelled along my forearms, but her smirk didn’t even falter. I stepped away, trembling.

In the light of the bedroom, I got my first proper look at the trespasser. She was tall, taller than my dad even, and painfully thin. A network of red veins stood out along one half of her face, deep wrinkles furrowed the other.

As she lunged at me. The momentum knocked me down and stripped my breath away as her body pinned mine against the carpeted floor.

Withered hands engulfed my face and hooked the sides of my mouth. Long digits, capped with fingernails sharper than ice picks, pulled and squeezed my cheeks the way you would a baby.

I pummeled her jaw again and again, but the blows had zero impact. I whipped from side to side and twisted like an eel but she held on tighter than a python.

For an old lady, she had one hell of a grip.

Exhausted from all the screaming, I was powerless to stop her as she scooped me up, cradled my head tight against her chest, rocked us back and fourth, and said, “It’s okay, Gary, Mommy’s home, Mommy’s home.”

I kept trying to explain my name was actually Alex, I don’t know how many times I said this.

Stringy drool thicker than Vaseline dribbled over my face as she kissed along my cheek, again and again, then she wrangled me over onto the bed before feeling her way along the outside of the room, stooped low, until she came to a loose portion of skirting board and shivered it off the wall.

There was a gap, but how the hell did *she* know about it? I’d slept in that room for 5 years and hadn’t noticed…

The thought of making a daring escape occurred to me, but the idea of getting within range of those pale, bird claws again set my jaw chattering.

She pulled a little tin box out of the hole and carried it towards me. Inside lay several children's drawings. Her mismatched eyes glistened as she flicked through the sheets. “You were always such a talented artist,” she said, in the warm tones you’d expect from a proud grandparent.

My entire body quivered as the drawings passed from her hands to mine. The first one showed three figures: a mother, a boy, roughly my age with the same dark hair, and a second, shorter boy.

The names above them said Mommy, Gary, and Benny.

Back in the middle of the space, she pulled a Vodka bottle out of her satchel, but rather than take a swig, she doused the carpeted floor with a clear liquid, dabbing the wardrobe, a chest of drawers, and my work desk as she passed them by. The blue walls turned a shade darker from where she'd splashed them.

After completing a full lap of the space, she held the bottle above her head and let the remainder of the contents spill over her like rainwater, then she tossed the bottle aside and pulled a little box of matches from her coat pocket.

“Time to see Benny,” she said cheerfully, eyes locked on mine. Then, without the slightest hesitation, she struck the match and tossed it onto the floor.

Flames raced around the room. They stretched out across the carpet, up the walls, over the bookshelf, spreading in every direction; they even extended over the bed, high enough to lick the soles of my bare feet.

This caused me to stand against the wall bouncing from one side to the other, desperate to avoid getting burned.

Breathing became more and more difficult as the fire surged and swelled. It engulfed the desk where I did my homework; my Action Man figures practically cried out as they liquified. Outside the room, a smoke detector wailed, this horrible *eeee, eeee, eeee* worse than nails against a chalkboard.

The sour stench of burning flesh and singed hair melted into the air, and while the raging inferno built up and up, the lady spun in circles, proud of her handiwork, ignorant of the fact she was burning like a Salem witch. Hell, if anything it looked like she was enjoying herself.

I was about to get embalmed inside my own bedroom–I needed to escape. But even without the lady throwing up an obstacle, the floor was an absolute deathtrap. I’d never make it across.

My eyes whipped around, finally landing on the window. Dad always said climbing out one was a good way to break your neck, but what other choice did I have?

I bounced up, twisted the handle, and hesitated as I looked down.

Darkness blotted out the canopy beneath the sill. I knew it was there but hesitated nonetheless.

“Gary no,” the pyromaniac said, and as she did, her breath ignited like some sort of Vegas stage show.

She lunged forward, arms outstretched, eager for one last hug. That’s how the firemen would find our remains, I thought; two interlinked skeletons. Maybe they’d think she died shielding me from the blaze?

“Come back,” she said. “Let’s be a family again.”

Talk about your motivational speeches…

When I got my body half outside, she threw herself across the bed and snatched my left ankle. Her palm had the consistency of jelly; the flesh came away in wet globs.

One little hop, and then the world gave way. My feet hit the angled surface of the canopy, sending me skidding sideways. After a split second of weightlessness, my back hit the top of a bin and make me spin right around, then I crashed into mom’s rosebushes, hard.

Still aflame, I tore off my pyjamas and rolled around in the dirt, my hands and feet already blistering. I’d made it out in one piece, though.

I looked up at my bedroom, where the intruder swiped the air and said, “Gary no, come back, come backkkkk.”

Her cries degenerated into a twisted scream of agony as the flesh dripped off her bones like candlewax.

At top speed, I flew toward the neighbour’s house where I mashed their doorbell. They got the shock of their lives at the sight of a nine-year-old covered in sweat and soil standing on the porch.

Without pausing for a single breath, I explained the situation, then they rushed me to hospital—the same one my parents were in.

The fire brigade arrived in time to save the house, although the repair costs set my parents back a fair bit, even with the insurance money.

But there was another nasty surprise to come. Because after the coroners identified the old lady by her dental records, they determined how she knew about that hidden compartment.

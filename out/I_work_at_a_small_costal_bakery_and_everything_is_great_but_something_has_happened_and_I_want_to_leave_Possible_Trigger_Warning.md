I’ve been working at a bakery in my little costal town for maybe 7 months now. I love it here. The customers are very kind and patient since it’s a retirement location and the two little old people who own the shop have always been so kind to me, providing me with free lunch from the warning case, giving me and my coworker the majority of the tips because “they’re too old to worry about money anymore”, and always making sure to tell me how thankful they are to have me here. It’s a pleasure to work at the location since it’s small, easy, and relatively steady. The old couple come in every Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.

Lately they’ve been rather late for work, and they’ve been acting strange. Yes, I know. Old people age and begin to lose motor functions as time goes on, but not like this. Their movements have been less smooth and slow. They walk like their bones need to be popped back into place. Of course, hoping to be considerate, I gave them the business card of my chiropractor the other day but they didn’t really answer me back about it. Their eyes are strange too. I don’t know what to make of it. They look glossed over, like they aren’t thinking or even looking really. (And now that I think of it they don’t blink as much either) Something felt very wrong and I was pretty worried about their well-being. 

As the day went on they began to really stink. The smell was flooding out the customers, and frankly making me want to do the same. I couldn’t send them home, because it wasn’t my shop, so I asked them if they were feeling alright and if they needed to go home and rest or drink some water. Again, no real reply, they just went to their car and left. I opened the windows to let the pungent air out and fill the bakery back up with the smell of bread and sugar.

Over the next week, when they came in on Wednesday, I decided something was actually wrong. Their skin was beginning to turn this sickly, gross yellow green color. Their eye sockets sagged more than I’ve ever seen them before, they REEKED of rotting. I was seriously worried at that point because I could see some sort of scarring on the back of the poor old lady’s neck, like a laceration of some sort. That creeped me out and I knew there was definitely something up. We kept the windows open the whole day and customers still tried to avoid us a little bit as the old couple left, I called the non emergency hotline and asked them to check up on the couple. I asked that they kept the ambulance sirens off as they drove up ti their house as it might startle them. 

I got a call from the paramedics the next day, they told me they weren’t allowed to disclose information but they needed to let me know that the couple had passed. I was rocked with devastation and sadness. It wasn’t until the towns Sheriff had “come in for a warm bagel” that I found out the paramedics had found them, sitting in their living room, emptied out. Their skin was cut off their body. They were made into skin suits. They called the police over and asked for assistance and they eventually caught the two people, their great granddaughter and her husband (who was relatively a pro at skinning animals I guess), who wanted to be closer to their great grandparents before they died. My stomach was flipped. I felt so sick and disgusted. I cried for the first time in a while that day. 

They’ve left the shop in my name. I know going and taking up the job as owner would be good for me financially but it feels so wrong. I want to do it for them, and their legacy, but I can’t seem to bring myself to go back into the bakery. I need some advice. Any help is good, thank you

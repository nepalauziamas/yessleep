I grew up in a village, all mud and thatch houses around me. I have always been a playful child. Growing up into a teenager didn't real make a difference. Always caught up with my imagination.
But someday something caught my attention. I was coming from the river with my grandmother and she told me that the family is looking for a husband for me. The news caught me off guard but the what did i know i just decided to fall in with everything that was asked of me.

A couple of days later i accompanied my parents to house in the neighborhood behind ours. I was to meet the man who was soon to be my husband. The man was not that older than me maybe 5 years, he was very handsome and built tall. The entire meeting a kept my head down. Everyone thought it was out of respect but well to me all the shyness and nervousness had overwhelmed me. The meeting had gone well i had met my husband and we where to start a family. The excitement of passing my imagination to my kids was overwhelming.

A couple of days later our days wa interrupted as one of my cousins has ran away from home with a boy from the village. It is said the 2 where in love but the elders did not approve of this. So the 2 decided to run away together and live in the forest surrounding the village. As days passed people would say they have seen the couple come into the village to steal food and what they needed. After a while of this the elders grow tired and decided to send a group of man to capture the couple and bring them back home. But whn the couple found out of this they run up a hill that was not that far from the village. But 1 thing u should know if this hill is that the locals consider it cursed a place where souls of the dead resides. All that to us kids we just thought it was  stories our mothers told us to frighten us not to go up the hill.

The group chased the couple to the foot of the hill the man looked at each other quite frightened recalling story's they heard of about the hill.  Suddenly they heard bone chilling screeams, howling and bollowing sounds from the top of the hill. After contamplating that the couple might be in trouble the all climbed up. After a while the found the couple but they both had their faces removed, like cut of but with no blood in sight. The group became so frightened the came dawn with the couples bodies.
But strange things started happening after those body where brought from that hill. Livestock started going missing children started going missing.
As the strangeness grew my husband decided we should move from this place.

Iam currently writing this on our journey to finding a new home for us but somehow i feel like something is following us. The End.

This will be my third visit this week to Ms. Everly’s for something nonsensical, I’m sure. Ever since my uncle passed this apartment building over to me, it’s been complete destruction on my day-to-day. Yesterday, Mr. and Mrs. Upton had some damage to their front doorframe. I just picked up the parts today to repair it. That will be on my to-do list before the days out. 

Ms. Everly seems like a sweet old lady although I’ve never seen her. The first time I was called over was because one of the residents had noted some damage to her bedroom window. She insisted she wasn’t feeling up to having any visitors and offered to let her grandson take care of it instead. I let it slide because I had enough on my plate as it is and if he wants to cover the cost, be my guest. The second time was last night due to noise complaints of thudding coming from her apartment. She must have went out before I got there because I couldn’t get a response when I knocked the door. Now I’ve been getting tenants approach me about odd smells coming from the residence. God, I hope she isn’t dead.

After the first three weeks of taking over as their landlord, I decided to save some money by moving into one the empty apartments. It saved me a drive every time I received a call about something needing to be repaired or how a neighbor was being inconsiderate. Ms. Everly resided at the end of the hall, furthest from my apartment. I can’t say I’ve never heard any disturbances coming from the property, but the heavy duty fan I purchased for the hot summer seems to drown out most of the noise and I’m a pretty heavy sleeper. In fact the only time in recent years I’ve found myself waking up was last night. 

I remember waking up in a cold sweat to a pitch black room, save for a dim street light just outside my bedroom window. The beam cast a light toward my bedroom door. For a moment, I could hear my floors creak ever so slightly. I lie there for a moment, thinking I must be going insane. I begin dozing off, but before I could, I hear my bedroom door shut as the handle releases and the mechanism locks into place. I sprang up. I was afraid to even leave my bed. Took me over 40 minutes to build the courage to get up. I searched every inch of the apartment, top to bottom and not a damn thing. I begin checking the locks until I get to the front door and notice, it’s unlocked. I must have forgotten. It’s a mistake I wouldn’t be making again.

Four calls so far about the smell coming from Ms. Everly’s. All of them from neighbors above her. They claim the smell is coming from downstairs and her upstairs neighbor seems absolutely certain it’s coming from directly below him, but I find it odd that none of the residents downstairs have noticed it.

As I open the front door to my apartment, I’m hit with a rotting smell that overwhelms me. I cover my face and begin making my way across the hallway, as I pass the Upton’s residence, I hear faint sounds of moaning coming from within the apartment. “Are you guys really humping each other with that smell right outside your door” I whisper under my breath. As I approach Ms. Everly’s, the sickly sweet smell begins to overpower me and becomes more unbearable the closer I got. 

I rang the doorbell and knocked three times before I realized no one would answer. I tried the handle and to my surprise, it was unlocked. I shouted to announce myself to anyone inside before entering. I turned the handle and flung open the door. The smell coming from within knocked me back and I took a moment to gather myself. I could see blood spatter on the walls and floors in small patterns down the hall into the living room. As I made my way down the hall, I started to notice scratch marks dug into the drywall and small chunks of meat scattered about. I hesitated to go any further. I should have just alerted the police, but my curiosity got the best of me.

The first thing I noticed was the skin stretched thin and almost translucent in the sunlight coming through the window. It was strung up and pulled tight by makeshift pieces of rope and string. Her face hung freely between the rest of her. Her skin was cleaned of any blood and her clothes were folded neatly next to her skinless corpse.

I can’t remember much else before I had called the police. They began making a sweep of the rest of the apartment, as crime scene technicians began swarming the body and skin suit on display. It wasn’t until they began evacuation of the building that things got much darker. The apartment across the hall from Ms. Everly was unresponsive. The Ling’s hadn’t been there for days if I remember correctly. They moved to The Upton’s where the moaning continued. After no verbal response, they entered the residence to find the both of them mostly in pieces. Mr. Upton was missing the lower half of his body, while Mrs. Upton was strung upside down above the bathtub, without her head, as the body drained of blood. They returned to the Ling’s to find only bits and pieces left of them. The apartment was covered head to toe in blood. Their Organs were tucked away in mason jars below the sink and the rest of them were put through a meat grinder the couple had in there apartment.

The police would later tell me that the killer seemed to be making his way from one end of the hall to the other. They started with the Ling’s and made their way to Ms. Everly and was interrupted before they could finish what they were doing to the Upton’s. They told me that had I not happened upon this, I would have most likely been next. Needless to say, I don’t live there anymore. In fact, I gave the property back to my uncle as soon as I could stomach leaving my new apartment. They haven’t caught whoever is responsible and I have no idea who it was, but I do know one thing now, that I didn’t before…

Miss Everly was only 19…

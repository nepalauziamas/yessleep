Gwangju, Busan, South Korea 2018

I own some apartments and shop front properties in Busan, South Korea. Yes, the infamous “Train to Busan” destination. I inherited the properties from my parents who both passed away when I was 23. I am 37 years old now and thankful at least they taught me all about managing the operational and business side of being a mini land lord.
Being in Busan all my life, I can assure you all that things are not as exciting as the movie suggests. 

I get paid quite well from rentals from my properties; sure there are problems and disputes to be solved once in a while. But you get that in any other job, not to mention a business.

So, in 2018 I happened to rent out a whole apartment unit to a Japanese couple. The rental term is 2 years with a month’s security deposit refundable when they return the keys and the unit returned in good condition.

We did the normal arrangements: viewing, explanations of the terms & conditions, paper work and payment of security deposit. Nothing out of the usual, all went smoothly.

Right from the start, they always pay on time via bank transfer. I never heard any request, complains, questions etc etc… for first 3 months. I figured they are private and maybe easy going. No complaints, quite the model tenants.

One day i decided to a courtesy call to the unit. (You know, want to be a good landlord and to make sure my place is all ok). But no answer of calls, nor my visits during off work hours yield any response. Seems they are out the most of the time. 

I was paranoid that there maybe an accident, problem, emergency or illegal use of the apartment so I used the spare key to open the unit. (After maybe 10 calls and 3 unfruitful visits).
 
I found the place totally untouched from when I handed over the unit; only more dust have settled in. But is not those messy dirty state; is just dusty. 
it is as if as they never used the unit: furniture not moved, no new items etc etc.. 
The normal usual dust just settles and accumulated.

I then checked with the utilities company. Found out that they pay on time, no arrears but also realised that there is no usage of electricity or water. Ever. 
I found it real strange and thought about it over a few sleepless nights. In the end, I decided to leave them alone. Since they paying right? And on time with no problems. 

That was the first and last time i checked on them and they never contacted me until the last day of the term; when the keys are mailed back to me. 

I went to the unit to check so that I can sign the end of lease documents and return their security deposit. 

The place looked like as if for 2 years, they never used or even went in.
There is more dust to add on to my unsolicited visit otherwise the state is the same: furniture not moved, no new items etc etc.. 

I was spooked honestly, being my first strange encounter in my business. However, as it turns out, its not my last….

So let me preface this with the fact they scouted me right out of college. I was going for my Bachelor's of Science with a focus in Genomics. I was only in my first year when I was approached. Apparently I was a genius. Not sure I'd go that far, but I digress.

When they brought me into the building on my orientation day it was your standard fair for what you'd expect of a government facility. They got me setup with my own ID badge that let me into certain places. Different labs and the break room and such. It all seemed about on the level of what I expected. Though I never thought I'd be a government employee. Let's just say that my views and that of the current administration never really lined up. What did line up, was the number of zeroes at the end of my yearly salary. They say money can't buy you happiness, but those people have never seen that many zeroes.

Again, getting off on a tangent. The first few months were pretty standard. We were doing experiments on these squid-like creatures. I'm not sure how exactly I'd describe them. They were a bit longer than any squids I'd ever seen. What I mean. Is they had limbs that were longer and two or four of them were sort of fused together about halfway down their length. It was almost like they had a lower body but it looks almost entirely fluidic. If that makes any sense.

We were looking into something interesting that happened during the creature's fight or flight response. Apparently it was able to release an airborne chemical into it's surroundings that caused those exposed to it to experience hallucinations that made the creature appear in a more human form. We believe that in the wild these creatures would make themselves look like their attacker to try an illicit a friendlier response. I'm not sure what they were considering this for but rumor was it was being planned for military use. Go figure of course.

So then we come to today, apparently on Wednesday something happened in the labs on the lower floors. No one will say what exactly but basement levels five through seven are completely locked down. I heard one person saying that one of the lead geneticist's kids was visiting and they've gone missing. I'm posting this from the comfort of my car outside. I worked on basement level five so until they sort this out I'm on a temporary paid vacation. I'm gonna head home and see if I can't find out more on what these creatures are. They seem to be the most comfortable in the water but can also move outside of it, though somewhat slower.

I'll try to keep you guys posted in case something happens but I'm not sure how much I can say and if maybe I've already said too much. But this is too bizarre for me to keep to myself and I don't really know what to think but I'm not sure what we're doing here is above board anymore.

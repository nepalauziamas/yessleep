So about six months ago my sister went on a trip with her boyfriend. My parents weren't okay with it, but they ended up letting my sister go since she wouldn't stop complaining.

She eventually left with him and she would call my mom every day telling her she was alright. But then she stopped calling and my parents couldn't get ahold of her. We got the police involved but they weren't much help.

And for six months our lives went on since there wasn't much we could do. It was around 8:45 pm and I decided to hop onto my computer and try out the dark web. All my friends at school were talking about it, but I wasn't that interested at first, but one of my friends told me it wasn't anything like what we were told. Saying it was a pretty cool place.

So I decided to give it a try. At first, it seemed weird until I found some interesting things like conspiracy theories and celebrity nudes which I don't even know how they got. But then I found some weird things. Like selling organs, weapons, and drugs. 

I then found an email and decided to click on it and it sent me to a live group chat. Nothing seemed to be happening so I decided to leave. But then a countdown started. I was interested in what was gonna happen so I stayed.

When the countdown ended the screen went black, then it showed a woman sitting in a chair with a bag over her head. The camera flipped around and a man stood there, He was wearing a clown mask. He laughed and flipped the camera back at the woman with the bag on her head.

I was a little scared by it because I didn't know what was going to happen to her. I then heard the woman start to cry, the man pulled the bag off of her head and I was shocked at what I saw. It was my sister. She looked abused and tired with tears coming down her eyes.

She started begging the man to let her go. He then held a knife up to her, I was freaking out at this point worried for my sister. He then stabbed her leg and my sister started screaming and I couldn't even help her. 

I then remembered the group chat to this and commented "Let my sister go before I call the cops!" And let me tell you that was one of the dumbest things I could have done. The man stopped and pointed the camera back at himself and said "Oh, I didn't know this was your sister, maybe when I'm done I'll pay you a visit." 

He then put the camera down and walked away. The only sound I could hear was my sister's cries. The man picked the camera back up and pointed it at a giant bucket full of water. He grabbed my sister by the head and shoved her face into the water as my sister tried to fight back.

After a while, she stopped and I noticed she wasn't moving at all, he let go of her, and I realized she was dead. The man started laughing menacingly and the video ended, I sat there not knowing what to do or say. I then got an email from some unknown user and when I saw it I started to freak out. Because my address was on it, and next to it said: "You're next!"

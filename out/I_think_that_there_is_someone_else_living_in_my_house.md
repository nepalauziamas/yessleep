Before I tell you about what’s happening in my house I need to tell you… everything I’m about to tell you is 100% true. Don’t believe me I don’t care but I need to tell some people about this.

So I’m gonna start at the beginning of when this started happening. And then it will get to what is happening currently.

…

It was Friday morning, I took the day off of work because I was under the weather. So I got out of bed and slowly made my way to the bathroom. I brushed my teeth and looked at myself in the mirror. 

I swear to everything that I look over and I see a black figure looking in at me through the crack in the door. I drop my tooth brush and I lunge out to the door and swing it open. I peak out of the doorway very slowly making sure he doesn’t grab me.

My heart so loud that I can hear it pounding against my ears. I slowly check behind my door to my bedroom and I run to my nightstand. I pull out my pistol and I start searching the house. I check EVERYWHERE but there’s nothing. So I start yelling.

“WHO EVER IS IN MY HOUSE I HAVE A GUN I AM NOT SCARED TO USE IT.”

I keep searching but find nothing… so I sit on my couch with my gun in my lap. And I just try to listen for any noise in my house. And I hear the quietest squeak in my attic. I stay calm trying not to show that I heard that. And I slowly make my way to my hallway and I quietly open up my attic door. I aim my gun up at the roof and I shoot three times as a warning.

“HEY ASSHOLE SHOW YOURSELF OR IM GONNA SHOOT YOU”

I get down and grab a flashlight that was in my room and I go back to the attic ladder. I climb up and I shine my flashlight around my attic. I see another black figure run past behind a box that was up there. I shoot the box three times and don’t hear a sound. I climb up to check if I killed him I make my way to the box. And there’s nobody there, no body nothing.

I panic and run back down to my couch and start thinking *am I crazy*. I then hear someone in my bedroom say “you missed me” very quietly. I am furious at this point and I run to my bedroom and search everywhere with my gun. But there is nobody. I sit down on my bed and I start crying.And then I scream at the top of my lungs “LEAVE ME ALONE”

And I hear someone say in my closet very faintly “I’m just playing with you”. I go to my closet and slowly point the gun inside and nobody. But then I see this cardboard box covering the back part of my wall. I slowly move it and it is a little space someone has been living in. I start getting more scared and I slowly crawl in. I get into the space and then someone hits me in the head.

And that’s when I think I got nocked out and i woke up on my bed a couple hours later. I get up quickly and look at the spot in my closet and it’s gone. There is no more space there and the noises have been gone ever sense.

I know you guys probably think I’m crazy but I’m not I swear this happened. I don’t know what to do I think I’m going crazy.

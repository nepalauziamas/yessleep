I live alone in a 2 bedroom apartment, occasionally my boyfriend, Mylo will stay over. My boyfriend and I are at a rocky point in our relationship right now, so he stays over a lot less. 

Tonight, I started hearing noises, coming from my walls. I didn’t think much of it because the apartments are located in an old building, probably about 90 years old, if not more.

The noises started getting more and more intense as the night went on. I called Mylo to ask him if he knew anything about it. 

“Hello?” Mylo asked.
“Hey babe, there are these noises coming from the wall are-“ Mylo stopped me.
“What?!?” He panicked.
“Uhm, I hear these noises coming from my walls.” I stated.
Mylo took a long pause. 
“Cassie, leave your apartment, as fast as you can, wait outside until I get there.” Mylo quickly hung up after he grabbed what sounded like keys.

Confused, I listened to him, and ran out to the hall. I got a text from Mylo. 

“Honey, put a match up to the fire alarm.”
He said it would by us enough time to get ‘it’ confused.

So I did. The fire bells started ringing. The pain in my ears was unbearable. The sprinklers went off, causing me to get all wet. The whole building was evacuated. Then my boyfriend pulled into the parking lot. 

He ran up to me and hugged me, then we waited for the building to get cleared as safe to go in. 

Once it did my boyfriend went in first. I followed. Mylo seemed like he knew what was going on. He looked at me and said. 
“Grab a knife.”
“What!!?” I responded.

He aggressively handed me a knife. He told me to stay by his side, so I did. Then we heard what sounded like a scream coming from my wall. Though it sounded like it was getting closer and closer to my vents.

Soon the distant screaming turned into close by laughing. Someone was in my vent. 

Mylo and I locked ourselves in the bathroom. The lauging was haunting me. The whistling, screaming, laughing, and scratching were driving me insane. I was terrified. 

Mylo knew what was going on, but I was on the verge of tears. 

Moments afterward, we heard; thump… thump… thump… 

It was in the vent right above us. I started to have a panic attack but Mylo covered my mouth. 

The vent on the ceiling broke and down fell someone that I knew. It was my dead sister. Still with the rope burn around her neck. Her murderer still hadn’t been caught. 

Tears started pouring. My boyfriend kept telling me not to interact with it, but I couldn’t help myself. My older sister died two years ago and I was still mourning.

“Daisy..?” I stuttered. 
“Cassie… you got to big.” Daisy smiled. 

Mylo begged me to stop talking to her and to close my eyes, but I couldn’t. 

Then my sister hugged me, when she hugged me I was my boyfriend lay lifeless. I ran to him, his wrist were slit, deep to the bones. I started sobbing uncontrollably. I lost my sister, now my boyfriend.

“He killed me Cassie.” Then Daisy slowly faded away.

The police are at my apartment. They think Mylo committed suicide. They won’t listen to me about my story, and are placing me in a mental hospital. I don’t need mental treatment. I need to know the truth.

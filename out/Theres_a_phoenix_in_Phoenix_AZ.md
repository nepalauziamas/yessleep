I broke the rules during lockdown. I met someone. 

It wasn't prearranged, I'm not *that* bad. It was a totally random encounter on one of my government recommended walks. 

I'm based in the Southland area of Phoenix, Arizona. The trails of South Mountain Park are just a short drive away, practically on my doorstep and my go-to hiking destination. 

One day I was on the trail up to Dobbins Lookout, enjoying the solitude. Despite exercise being one of the only outdoor activities we were legally allowed to partake in, most days I wouldn't see a soul. It was eerie at first, but in some ways I began to appreciate it. It was so calming, and the park had never been so clear of trash. 

A Boston Terrier with a blue collar came running towards me, panting at my feet. It was around 90°F out and the poor thing looked hot and thirsty. I had a look around my immediate vicinity, lifting up the peak of my baseball cap and peering over my aviators. Not a soul in sight. 

"Hello, you," I said, bending down and patting his warm fur. "What are you doing out here alone?" I took my water bottle from my backpack and gently tipped it upright near his mouth. He lapped it up. He was the first living thing that had interacted with me on the trail for weeks. I'd seen many lizards and birds but they weren't very sociable. 

"Milo!" came a voice from just up ahead. I looked up to see a man coming down the trail. He was wearing a *Cardinals* cap, mid-length dark hair spilling from the sides. The dog turned to look at him but didn't move, looking back at me with his tongue hanging out. 

"Perdón, sorry," the man said as I stood up, sealing the water bottle. I waved my hand. 

"No problem, this little guy looked parched and I thought maybe he was lost." 

The man shook his head and laughed. "Ah, Milo. So dramatic! He had like a gallon of water just a few minutes ago. He loves to take advantage of kind strangers." 

I looked down at Milo, tongue hanging from the side of his open mouth like butter wouldn't melt. I chuckled and crouched back down, ruffling his ears gently. 

"Is that right, Milo? Ah, I'll let you off as you're so darn cute!" 

The man stopped in his tracks and held up a hand, looking just to my right. He spoke quietly. 

"Don't move." 

Being a born and raised Arizonian, I had a rough idea of what was going on. I took in a deep breath and gave him a slight nod, holding on to Milo's collar. 

The man stepped off the trail and carefully traversed rocks and sparse greenery. I could see him circling round in my peripheral vision. As he vanished from sight I heard the unmistakable sound of a rattler, and Milo began to whine. I closed my eyes, taking in long deep breaths and trying to keep myself calm. 

"Got ya!" said the man. I turned with relief. He was holding the snake around its neck like it was completely natural. "Diamondback. Can be nasty little fuckers." 

I let out a breath and gave Milo a pat for being a good boy. 

"My hero," I said, laughing uncomfortably. "I take it this isn't the first time you've been this up close and personal with one?" 

He shook his head and started walking away. "Get 'em in the yard all the time." 

Milo watched his human and let out a bark as the guy put the snake down behind a large saguaro cactus, then hastily walked back over. 

"Good boy, Milo," I said, patting his head and letting him go. He ran straight to the guy and jumped up at him, scooped up into a hug. 

"I'm alright, perrito," he said, scrunching up his face as lots of wet kisses were given. He put Milo down, who immediately went scurrying towards the cactus. 

"Don't even think about it, tonto!" the man shouted over his shoulder. Milo stopped and barked in frustration, but he obeyed and went sniffing elsewhere. 

"Loco," he said, shaking his head.

"Thank you," I said. "That could have ended badly." 

As he stepped closer I got a better look at him. I would have put him in his early 30s, a really handsome guy. He waved his hands, dismissing it. 

"Ah, it's nothing. Thanks for keeping my dog out of trouble." He approached me and held out his hand. "I'm Santi." 

My initial thought was to take a step back and refuse the handshake. The importance of social distancing had been drummed into us for months. But it seemed too cold, especially as he'd potentially saved me from a nasty snake bite. Truthfully, a part of me was excited to be this close to another human again. So I took his hand. 

"Jacob," I said, smiling. "Jake. Pleasure to meet you." 

+ 

The next day I went back to the trail earlier, before it got too hot. I took a different route this time. As far as the scenery goes, it doesn't change all that much. You're guaranteed rocks, cacti, and lizards wherever you go. It's still one of my favorite getaways regardless. 

I perched on a rock near a grumpy looking chuckwalla, taking a few pictures on my phone before taking a much needed swig of water. A voice calling from behind made me jump a little. The lizard didn't hang around, scurrying off. 

"Güero!" 

Milo was at my feet before I had the chance to turn, jumping up to my knees. 

"Hey little buddy," I said, cupping his cute face. 

"I think he likes you, Jake," said Santi, taking a seat next to me. 

"Well, he's got good taste. Don't you Milo?" 

He barked once and then seemed to lose interest, running off to investigate the area. 

"I stand corrected," I laughed. 

"Ah, he's young," said Santi. "Attention span is limited." 

He took out a small tupperware box from his backpack which contained empinadas. He held it out to me. 

"Bet you ten bucks he'll come running back as soon as you start eating." 

I laughed and took one, holding it up to him. 

"Thanks," I said, and took a bite. It was delicious. "Mmm, man! Where'd you get these?" 

"I made them," he said with a grin, before biting into one. 

"Seriously?" I said with no manners at all, mouth full. "Santi, it's so good! What's in it?" 

He swallowed a mouthful. "I call these *'Diamondback Surprise'*." 

I stopped chewing and glared at him over my sunglasses. He just stared at me deadpan. 

"Santi. Please tell me you're joking." 

He flashed his teeth and slapped my back. 

"Course I am, güero," he said, laughing to himself. "Chicken." 

I shook my head and blew air in my face. "So cruel. You know, the thought kinda turns my stomach. But these are *that* good, I'd probably still have finished it." 

As predicted, Milo came sprinting over and sat in front of us, head cocked to the side. I laughed. 

"And look who's back!" 

I joined them for the rest of their hike, then we walked back down the trail together. Santi lived in South Mountain Heights, a stone's throw from the park. However they accompanied me to my car, so I offered them a ride to spare them another half hour or so in the heat. 

"We're totally breaking the law right now," I said, this probably being one of the most wild things I'd ever done. "Imagine getting a criminal record for giving a man and his dog a ride?" 

Santi laughed, holding on to Milo on his lap. "I'll just pretend I'm having an episode. You were kind enough to drive me home." 

I looked at him and tapped my head. "Genius!" 

By that point in time I'd been single for at least a year, and dating had been put on hold for obvious reasons. I was pretty useless at reading a potential date's intentions, and generally noticing those 'signs' that suggest there could be something there. Unless it's the most unsubtle flirting of course, which this wasn't. That being said, I just had a gut feeling there was a mutual attraction between us. 

I pulled up outside Santi's house, a single storey with a chain fenced dusty garden. 

"So," I began, feeling butterflies in my stomach. "I'm not sure if I've got this all wrong, and if I have I apologize. But I'd love you to come to my place for dinner one evening. Milo too, of course." 

He looked at me over his Ray Ban wayfarers. "Like, two bros and a dog just hanging out?" 

I was momentarily speechless, letting out an extended *errrr*. I felt a bit flustered. 

"I mean, yeah. Like, maybe get a pizza and, er, you know. A few beers?"

"Hmmm," he said, hand on chin. "I think I'll have to pass. I'd only be interested if it was like, say, a date." 

Now it was my turn to look at him deadpan as he smirked.

"Is it too late to rescind the invitation?" I said. Milo barked, he was pretty loud for a little dog. 

"Ah, sorry güero," he said. "That means yes. So we'll be taking you up on that offer." 

I shook my head and began to smile. "Something tells me I'm gonna have to get used to being fooled a lot." 

We swapped numbers and I scratched Milo behind the ear. 

"Thanks for the ride, Jake," said Santi. He made a move to get out of the car, then quickly turned and pecked me on the cheek. I was beaming all the way home. 

+ 

A few nights later Santi and Milo came over. 

"Hurry up," I said quietly as they walked up the garden path. "Before someone sees you!" I motioned for them to get in the house. 

"I think we're clear," said Santi as I closed the door, Milo vanishing to investigate the new environment. "I didn't see anyone, and I parked further down the street so no one will see a strange car outside your house." 

I smiled. "You're so fucking smart."

He grinned and shrugged. "Ah, what can I say?" 

It was the first time I was seeing him in non-hiking attire. The shorts and tee were replaced by blue jeans and a black green checked shirt. His dark hair had a slight wave to it, he wore it swept back. There was a subtle gloss to it from some kind of product. He had a short, neat beard. His eyes were a warm hazel, his long dark eyelashes made them pop. He'd brought a six-pack of Corona as promised in our text messages. I realized I was staring. 

"Sorry, come through," I said, taking the beer and escorting him to the kitchen. "I'm not *that* paranoid, but my neighbor Mrs. Ruiz is pretty damn nosey. It wouldn't surprise me if she's taking notes right now." 

I put the beer on the counter and removed two, then turned to put the rest in the fridge. 

"I mean, I don't think she's the type that would tell on me or anything, but she'd love to have something to..." 

Before I could finish, Santi grabbed me around the waist as I turned, pressing his warm lips against mine. I made an embarrassing little murmur from inside my throat as I put my arms around him. He pulled back and looked into my eyes.

"Hi," he said with a slight smile. He smelt amazing. 

"Hi," I replied, feeling my face warm up. "You look great by the way." 

We ate lasagna alfresco in my relatively maintained back garden. I've never really had green fingers. Fortunately the plants that mostly grow around here are tough and can pretty much look after themselves. The edges just need a little trimming from time to time, which I can handle. Milo was in his element, sniffing around and marking his territory as Santi and I got to know each other better. 

"May I use your bathroom?" he said, putting down his beer bottle. 

"There's a perfectly good bush there," I said. "I mean, it's good enough for Milo." 

"Ah, you just want to look at my junk," he said with a wink. "All you have to do is ask." 

I laughed and shook my head. "There you go with the smarts again. Come on, I'll point you in the right direction." 

I picked up the plates and explained where to go, not that my house is *that* big. It wouldn't take long to find the bathroom by trial and error.

I ran the faucet to start the dishes, watching Milo out of the kitchen window. As I shut off the water I heard a thump come from inside the house. I called over my shoulder. 

"Santi?" 

There was no response, then Milo came charging through the back door and ran down the hallway. I dried my hands on the dish towel and followed him, a little concerned. 

"Santi, everything okay?" 

I heard Milo barking, so I picked up the pace. Just outside the bathroom door, Santi was lying on his side. He was convulsing. 

"Fuck, Santi!" I yelled, dropping to my knees and putting my arms under his head. Milo had his front paws resting on Santi's legs, barking. Santi's eyes flickered up into the back of his head as I felt overwhelmed with panic. I had never had any first aid training, but I remember seeing somewhere that it's important to keep someone having a seizure on their side so they don't swallow their own tongue. 

"Hold on Santi," I said, pulling my phone from my jeans pocket with a trembling hand. Milo kept barking, worried for his human. "It's alright Milo, I'm calling for help." 

As I attempted to access my phone, Santi lifted a hand and gripped my wrist. It was pretty tight, and his hand felt incredibly warm. I looked at his face. As his eyes flickered I saw flashes of deep red. They looked demonic. 

I screamed out. It only encouraged Milo to bark louder. Santi shook the phone from my hand, turning his face to look me straight in the eyes. My heart was racing as his mouth slowly opened, and he let out a deep groan from his chest. His body continued to convulse as the groan became louder. 

"Santi!" I screamed, not knowing what to do. It felt like something terrible was about to happen. Without warning, a strong gust of wind came through the house. I heard various objects falling from counters and tables as the sound began to drown out Milo's barks. Santi slowly began to arch his back, his head tilting upwards as he continued to groan. His eyes were a glowing blood red. 

"What the fuck is happening?" I screamed, my hands trembling as I held on to Santi. My forearm was supporting him behind his neck and I felt his skin increase in temperature. It became almost unbearably hot but I couldn't let him go. 

There came a warm glow from Santi's wide open mouth that increased in brightness as his groan increased in pitch. I stared in terror, wide eyed. My arm began to burn tenfold, my screams became not only those of terror but of pain. Then, as his groan reached a terrifying crescendo, a light as bright as flames filled the room. 

I shut my eyes tight. There was a constant ringing in my ears. Other than that, deathly silence. 

When I finally opened them Santi looked peaceful, resting in my arms. Milo was delicately licking his face but otherwise calm. My breathing came out in stutters as I tried to relax and process the events. I initially thought that Santi had passed over, his body was so still. But as I looked more closely I could see his chest move as he breathed. 

I lightly placed a trembling hand on Santi's head, stroking his warm hair. Then I started to cry. 

"Santi, please wake up." 

+ 

Santi laid on my couch, a cold wet cloth draped across his forehead. Milo was curled up asleep at his feet. I knelt by his side, a bag of ice pressed against the underside of my forearm which was bright red and sore. We just stared at each other in silence for a moment. Then he reached out and took one of my hands, shaking his head. 

"I'm so sorry, Jake," he said. "That must have been..." 

"Terrifying?" I interrupted. "Yeah, that's one way to put it." I shook my head and looked up to the ceiling. "It's like, I can't accept what happened. But I can't deny it. I mean, look at the state of this place!" 

My house looked like it had been overturned by burglars extensively searching for a particular item. 

"Not to mention my arm. Santi, what the fuck did I just witness?" 

He lowered his eyes and let out a long breath, squeezing my hand. "So the other day when you gave us a ride, I jokingly said I would fake an episode if we got pulled over. Well, there was some truth in that. I *do* have episodes from time to time." 

I nodded. "Yeah, you're telling me. But that wasn't just an episode, Santi. That was some fucking supernatural, possession..." I shook my head, looking for a word. "Shit!" 

"I know," he said. "It's fucking crazy! But I need you to know that I would never hurt you." 

"Oh no? This says otherwise." I dropped the bag of ice and held up my arm. 

"Lo siento," he said, pulling my arm closer to him. He gently blew cool air, temporarily soothing it, before placing a gentle kiss. He looked at me with such guilt. It made me feel bad. 

"The things my body does when I'm having one of these... episodes. I can't help that. But I would never intentionally hurt you, Jake. I can *somewhat* control it. As you saw for yourself, when you tried to call for help. The last thing we need are the authorities and medical professionals. I don't think I'd ever be free again if they got their hands on me." 

I put my hand on the side of his face, feeling my eyes glaze over a little. He held it against him. 

"What are you, Santi?" I asked, quietly and confused. He met my eyes. 

"I'm a phoenix." 

+ 

A few months went by, Santi and I were very much in a forbidden lockdown relationship. In absence of conventional dates we spent our time together shared between our respective homes, sneaking around like naughty kids. 

Occasionally my doorbell would ring and Mrs. Ruiz would leave a homemade pie or sweet treats neatly wrapped up on the doorstep. She wasn't stupid. She knew I had a guest and would give me a knowing nod as I'd open the door to thank her. I think she was happy for me. 

When we were at Santi's we made a lot of traditional Spanish and Mexican food together. Santi was an amazing cook, he put me to shame really. But as he reminded me when I mentioned it, he'd had many years to perfect his skills. 

"How old are you exactly?" I asked as I kneaded dough to make tortillas. Santi shook his head. 

"I honestly couldn't tell you. I stopped keeping track. But I'm gonna say at least 300 years." 

As I'm sure you can imagine, I'd ask many, many questions about it. The whole thing was completely mind blowing, and some days I would have a moment of denial. But the evidence couldn't be disputed. 

He'd never settle in the same place for too long, and tried not to integrate with the community too much to avoid arousing suspicion. A dog was the perfect companion because they don't judge and ask questions.

When I asked him how he'd become the way he was, he said he couldn't remember. All he knew was that he was born human.

Santi explained that the world was full of strange things that most humans wouldn't be able to comprehend, but only a small few would ever experience. I've always loved reading fantasy and horror novels. Santi had a look over my bookcase one day. 

"It wouldn't surprise me if half of these books are based on a truth," he said. It made me feel kind of special, as well as unnerved. I'll never look at the world the same way again. 

Our only outdoor activity was hiking, which was just as well because we both adored it. Milo would always accompany us, of course. Santi mentioned that on the rare days we weren't together, Milo would whine at the door like something was missing. It filled my heart. In the space of just a few months, I couldn't believe I'd gone my whole life without those two in it. It felt so right. 

We were walking the trail like normal. Santi held my hand while Milo sniffed around. In the distance there were two men walking towards us. I could count on one hand how many people I'd seen on the trail since lockdown began. Milo spotted them and ran to say hello. 

"My dog is such an attention whore," laughed Santi. 

"I'm glad," I said. "We might not have ever met if it wasn't for Milo." 

He lifted my hand and kissed it. "I like to think the world would have brought us together regardless." 

There was a little yelp and we saw Milo scurrying towards us in a cloud of dust. One of the men, wearing a green baseball cap, was yelling and tried to chase after him, kicking his leg out. 

"What the fuck?" said Santi, letting go of my hand and running in their direction. Santi crouched down and Milo ran into his arms, whining. I reached them and gave Milo some love too. 

"You alright, perrito?" said Santi. I could hear he was upset. The men were still walking towards us, laughing. Santi turned to me. 

"Hold him, Jake." He got up to confront them. I picked up Milo into a hug, the poor little guy shook in my arms. 

"Santi, don't!" I called. "They're just a couple of assholes, they're not worth it." 

"Hey!" Santi yelled. Green held up his hands, grinning. 

"What?" he said. "It's my right to defend myself against an untamed mutt. Keep it on a fucking leash if you can't control it." 

"He's a fucking puppy," Santi screamed, his anger made me flinch. "He was saying hello." 

They stopped a few feet apart from each other, facing off. I don't want to generalize, but the men looked like trouble. There was something about their body language and the smirks on their faces that made me feel uneasy. The other guy wore a blue cap and spoke up, shaking his head. 

"I saw everything. That little fuck attacked my friend." He pointed to Milo. 

"Santi, come on," I said, my stomach churning. "Let's just go." 

"Yeah, Santi," said Green. "Why don't you listen to your girlfriend and fuck off."

Blue burst into laughter. My heart was beating hard. 

"What the fuck did you just say?" said Santi. I could see his body trembling. 

"I think you heard him," said Blue. "You ladies better watch yourself. Kinda secluded, ain't it? Anything could happen out here." 

Santi pointed his finger to Green. "Apologize to my *boy*friend." 

"That's not necessary," I said. "We'll be on our way. Come on Santi." 

The men laughed, showing no signs of being intimidated. 

"At least one of you girls has some sense," said Green. He knocked into Santi then came up to me and sneered. Milo barked and I held him tight against me. 

"Next time I see this mutt I'll do more than kick his bony little ass." 

They continued down the trail laughing. Santi came and put his arm around me, patting Milo with his other hand. Blue raised his hand and waved. 

"See ya 'round, ladies!" 

Santi moved his body forward like he was going to give chase and I gripped his arm. 

"Please, Santi," I said. "That's enough for one day. My nerves can't take any more." 

"They can't get away with that, Jake!" he said, fuming. I nodded. 

"I know, it's an injustice," I said, stroking his arm. It was radiating heat. "They're cunts, but you don't know what they're capable of."

He looked at me, his eyes intense, a flash of red within his hazel irises. "They don't know what *I'm* capable of." 

+ 

That evening we had dinner at mine. Mrs. Ruiz had left a care package of brownies so we had dessert. There was even a little bag of beef jerky with a label that just had a paw print drawn on it. 

"I think she approves," I said as I showed it to Santi. She was nosey in abundance but clearly had a heart of gold. I made a mental note to have her over for dinner when the restrictions were lifted, we'd never really gotten to know each other that much. 

We played gin rummy while we drank bottles of beer. I asked a bunch of questions like I normally did, and Santi humored me like he normally did. 

"Who was the greatest love of your life?" I asked. "I'm sure you've had a few." 

He sighed. "Actually, not as many as you'd think. It's quite difficult to explain why I'm not physically aging, as well as the other freaky things that I struggle to hide sometimes. My relationships generally haven't lasted that long."

"Did you tell any of them about, you know, what you really are?" 

He nodded. "One or two. Going back some time, there was one girl..." 

"Girl?" I asked, grinning. "The plot thickens." 

He laughed. "Yep. You could say I've dabbled over the years. Anyway, this particular girl, Maria, she knew. That was the closest I got to becoming a dad." 

He had a look of sadness in his eyes, I reached out and put my hand over his. He gave me a warm smile. 

"She miscarried twice. We never tried again. I think that our bodies just weren't compatible in that way. I mean, I'm technically no longer human. I feel it here most of the time..." He tapped his head. "But my body tells me otherwise." 

I wiped away a tear. "I never considered how much of a burden it must be in some ways. You must have been through and seen a lot?" 

He nodded. "I have, güero. But then I meet people like you and it makes it worthwhile." 

We made love that night, I felt the closest to him yet. When he truly let himself go, not having to hide what he is, his eyes would burn and his skin would radiate against me. It was scary at first, but I came to crave it. It was the most intensely passionate sex I'd ever had.

+ 

A few weeks passed. After our encounter with Green and Blue, we'd found alternative locations to hike. Not that I was paranoid or anything, but I felt better leaving it for a while. And it wasn't like Phoenix had a shortage of trails. 

We parked up at one of the smaller preserves early one evening, as the day was getting cooler. With water and energy bars packed, we started walking with Milo eager to investigate. 

As we made our way to the highest point, the sky a beautiful shade of purples and reds, we heard voices in the distance. From our current position we could make out the silhouettes of four people. Three were standing, and one looked like they were crouched lower. There was a heated discussion, then a sudden bright flash followed by a gunshot. The figure who was crouched toppled out of sight. 

It was an execution. 

Santi grabbed me before I had a chance to react, pulling me behind a rock. Milo was up ahead somewhere. 

"Fuck, Milo," he said under his breath. My heart was racing. 

"That was definitely a murder, wasn't it?" I said quietly. He nodded. 

"I can't leave Milo. Jake, go. Drive home. I'll find him and meet you later." 

"Are you crazy?" I said, just louder than a whisper. "There's no fucking way I'm leaving you." 

"And there's no fucking way I'm losing you," he said, grabbing my arms. His eyes flashed red and his tight grip began to heat up. I reached up and held his face in my trembling hands, nodding. 

"Okay, okay. I'll go. But please, Santi. Be safe. Find Milo and run like fuck. Don't get involved." 

He pressed his burning forehead against mine, it felt like he had a temperature. 

"I don't intend to, Jake." He kissed me, his lips warm. "Go!" 

I started to make my way back down the trail, looking back over my shoulder. Santi kept low as he made his way up. Barely 30 seconds must have gone by when I heard barking somewhere behind me, followed by another quick flash and a second gunshot. 

"Milo!" I heard Santi scream in the distance. It echoed against the various rock formations and filled me with dread. I was temporarily frozen to the spot, but the third gunshot was the kick in the ass I needed. I began running back up the trail. 

Four silhouettes were visible against the twilight. One of them was most definitely Santi being attacked by the others. 

"Santi!" I screamed, my stomach in knots. I had no idea if I could be heard or not. My legs felt like jelly as I forced myself to keep running up the path towards the backlit brawl. 

I saw a bright orange glow light up the rocks and tall saguaro cacti in the area, followed by a heart stopping scream. One of the silhouettes became engulfed in flames and ran away from the others before collapsing. 

As I got closer the words that just seemed to mingle into one big inaudible echo became clear. 

*"What the fuck are you?"* I heard someone yell. *"Kill him!"* screamed another. 

I heard a whine to my right and saw Milo curled up by a rock. He looked up at me with his puppy eyes and my heart broke. One of His back legs was bleeding. It was a gunshot wound.

"Oh, Milo," I said quietly, stroking his head. "I'll come back for you, but I need to go help daddy." 

I could hear Santi screaming with rage as the two others grunted loudly. I gave Milo a quick kiss on his head and continued up the hill. 

When I finally got to the clearing, I could make everything out. There were two bodies on the ground; one man with a bullet wound to the head and one that was currently unrecognisable due to its charred state. 

The other two guys were the assholes we'd seen in South Mountain Park. Santi was being held back by none other than Green, and Blue was scrambling for a handgun that was on the ground. 

"Hurry the fuck up," screamed Green. "His arms feel like hot irons!" I could make out faint smoke rising from his hands as he groaned. 

I charged in the direction of Blue and knocked him down, but didn't really know how I was going to follow that up. I'd never been in a fight in my life. Blue looked around, momentarily surprised, then sneered.

"You!" he yelled, and jumped on top of me. His hands closed tightly around my neck. "Let's see if you're a freak too!" 

"Jake!" Santi screamed. I turned to see his head fly back and smash into Green's nose, forcing him to let go and fall back. It looked like he hit his head on a rock. Santi ran over and pulled Blue off me, allowing me to breathe. 

There was a bright light in my peripheral vision, followed by a disturbing scream. I turned to see Santi holding Blue around his neck, his hands the piercing glow of molten rock, and Blue's face was in a ball of white hot flame. 

I covered my mouth as the smell of burning flesh filled the air, and Santi's hands slipped through Blue's neck like ice. Blue's head hit the ground and rolled, flickering bright embers that danced into the night. His headless body fell to its knees, then slumped to the side. 

Santi looked at me, his burning eyes calming to a warm shade of hazel as his hands began to turn back to their usual skin tone. At that moment, I had conflicting emotions. I feared him, for this was the first time I'd witnessed what he was truly capable of. But I also felt adoration. The lengths he would go to protect and honor me filled my heart. I think he could sense the uncertainty, and he raised his hands to show he meant no harm. 

"Jake, it's me," he said softly, taking small steps. "I'm sorry you had to see that. But I couldn't let him hurt you." 

I felt tears in my eyes, and I managed a smile as I held up my shaking hand from the dusty ground. He reached out to take it, then stopped dead in his tracks. 

Three loud gunshots pierced my eardrums, followed by the repeated clicks of an empty chamber. I turned to see Green on his knees, his nose busted up, pointing the smoking gun. 

I turned back to Santi, my eyes wide. He stared vacantly, slowly looking down to his stomach as blood started to soak through his t-shirt. Then he looked into my eyes, a small smile on his lips as he collapsed. 

"Santi!" I screamed, crawling to him. I pressed my hands tightly against his stomach, feeling his warm blood ooze between my fingers. 

"Santi, stay with me," I said desperately. "Oh God, stay with me please." 

I felt his hands close around mine and pull them away from his stomach. I looked into his eyes. Mine were confused, his were warm with acceptance. He reached up and touched my face.

"I think I'm falling in love with you, güero," he said, and I broke down. 

"Not now," I said in tears. "Please, not now. You can tell me later. I'll get you to the hospital, they'll understand. There'll be no questions. They'll fix you up. I'll bring you home. I'll look after you..." 

"It's too late, Jake," he said. "I'm ready. I've had a long life. It's time to see what's on the other side." 

"No, please don't leave me." I put my head on his chest, I could feel his heart slowing. 

"Promise me you'll look after Milo," he said. "Someone's gotta watch out for that dummy." 

I looked at him and nodded, wiping my eyes. "Of course I will." 

He smiled. "Give me a kiss, guapo." 

Our lips met and I briefly felt his hands on my face before they fell to his sides. When I pulled away, his eyes were closed. Santi had left this world. 

"Sorry to break up your touching moment," said Green from behind. I turned with just enough time to see the butt of the gun come down as it struck me on the top of my head. I fell onto my back, my vision was blurred. He stood over me, then crouched down, straddling me. 

"Don't get any funny ideas, sweetheart," he said. "It's not what you think it is." 

He threw the gun and picked up a football sized rock, then he raised his hands high above. I was too disorientated to fight back, and accepted what was to come. But then a little hero came to my rescue. I heard Milo barking somewhere to my right, and Green yelled as I heard growling. 

"You little fucker!" He swung back and threw the rock. I could see a blurry Milo avoid getting hit, but he wasn't his usual speedy self due to his injury. Green swung his leg over me and lunged for Milo, who yelped as he was caught around the collar. 

"I told you I'd do more than kick your ass the next time I see you!" snarled Green. Milo yelped again and I forced myself to turn over, stumbling to my feet. 

"Get the fuck off my dog!" I screamed, hitting Green on his back with my clenched fists. I don't think it was with any particular strength. He swung around and punched me on the side of my face, knocking me back down. He laughed. 

"Stay down, sweetheart. I'll get back to you once this mutt's skull is crushed."

There was a sudden burst of light that took us all off guard. It was a fire. I tried to focus hard enough to see what the source was, all I could make out was that it was coming from the general direction of Santi's body. 

"What the fuck?" said Green. 

Milo had managed to find his way to me, limping. He softly whined as he licked my face, and I wrapped my arms around him. 

"Good boy," I said, kissing the top of his head. We watched as the flames grew taller, and brighter. Green got to his feet and slowly started to walk towards it, using his hands as a visor. 

I felt a gentle breeze on my bare skin and there was a slight howl in the air. The tall cacti began to sway as the breeze became wind, and debris from the clearing began to swirl in a vortex. It gave life to the fire, which reached as high as the tallest rocks that seemed to balance questionably above. It roared into the night. 

"That's not possible," said Green, drawn to the fire like a sailor to a siren. I held Milo tight and sheltered him from the wind, my eyes still trying to frantically search for what was causing such an incredible inferno. Then from somewhere within it, I saw. 

Santi's body was suspended above the rocky ground. It reminded me of that scene from *The Exorcist* with the little girl rising from her bed. The flames swirled around him as he continued to rise, higher than the tallest saguaro. Milo was as captivated as me, staring in awe. 

Green followed Santi with his eyes, transfixed to the spot just in front of the flames.

There was an explosion of light that must have been seen throughout the city. Milo yelped and buried his face into my armpit. My mouth hung ajar as swirls of the deepest shades of fall mingled with electric blue, and a deafening screech echoed throughout the clearing. 

From the flames emerged a giant bird, from the very corners of mythology. It threw its head to the sky and screeched again, its wings open and flung back like a proud swan. Its feathers were the most striking orange, and tinged with accents of blue. It must have been at least 30 feet tall with a wingspan twice that. 

Green fell to his knees and held up his hands, crying. It was hard to tell if it was from fear or from the overwhelming beauty of the creature before him. But when the bird looked down to meet his eyes, there was no doubt in what he felt. 

The flames dispersed in a mushroom cloud, and the bird stepped forward to pin Green against the ground. Its claws dug into his flesh, causing him to scream. I watched in horror and fascination as the bird opened its giant beak and breathed hot, blue flames over his body in an ear splitting screech. His body convulsed as his skin melted away, followed by muscle tissue, and eventually bone. All the while he screamed until he physically couldn't. 

As the bird finished with him, it turned its gaze to me. It took several big steps that sent tremors throughout the ground. Milo shook in my arms. Was I afraid? Absolutely. But it really was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.

It lowered its head to meet mine, its eyes a constant flicker of flame. I cried silent tears as I reached up to touch it, and then I passed out. 

All I can remember before waking up at home the next day is gaining consciousness somewhere over Phoenix. I could feel the cool night air against my skin as the city lights flew by hundreds of feet below. I looked down to see Milo asleep in my arms, and closed my eyes to join him.

I never saw Santi, or should I say what he became again. At least up to this point. I do often wonder where he went. There surely can't be *that* many places for a creature of his size to go unnoticed. But I'm no expert on the subject, I have no idea if such creatures are bound by the laws of nature and science. I have no idea if it's even Santi anymore.

Milo is still going strong, takes more than a bullet to stop that pup! Mrs. Ruiz adores him and spoils him rotten. Though it didn't take too long to realize that Santi had left more than just Milo with me.

It's the flashes of red I sometimes see in my reflection. It's the blackouts that hit me on the odd occasion, only to wake up in an overturned house. It's the feeling of heat rising inside that comes from both anger and passion. It's the fact that if I *really* concentrate, my mug of coffee never drops in temperature. It's the fact that I haven't aged a day since I met Santi.

How am I going to explain this to my family and friends? I must have asked Santi a hundred questions when we were together, but I wish I'd asked a hundred more. I have no idea how to deal with this, and unfortunately there's no manual. I'll just have to work it out for myself, as scary as it is sometimes.

I guess one day I'll find out what happened to Santi. Though that could be many, many years from now.

There's a phoenix in Phoenix, Arizona. 

It's me.

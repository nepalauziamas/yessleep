The day had gone by slow, considering I live in an isolated area in the middle of the woods I had nothing to do after I finished up some work on my laptop. It was getting late and I started to put on my shoes so I could go on a walk in the woods behind my house to clear my head. I went out the back door of my house, closing the door behind me. I started walking on my normal path, taking in the cold woodsy air. The smell of pine was overwhelming. But not overwhelming enough. After I had begun to wander and let my body into auto pilot for a bit, I started to smell something. Something putrid. Like a dead animal or something rotting near by. I started looking around the area, scanning behind trees and on the dirt ground covered in leaves.

Then I saw something that would become the reason I ended up writing this.

There was a human body sized bump underneath all the leaves. I wouldn't have touched it if I had been in a different situation but I guess I was especially curious that night and did something I really wish I didn't do. I walked over to the spot where I saw it and started brushing the leaves off of the bump and clear as day, what lay before me the dead rotting body of what seemed to be an almost unrecognizable young woman. The smell was so overwhelmingly disgusting I was about to vomit when something else turned my stomach and turned my disgusted into fear. I saw a figure. 

About 10 feet away the dark silhouette of a person standing behind a tree. Watching me. I slowly started to get back on my feet until I saw another. Another silhouette. To my right, same distance. Watching me. And another. To my left. This one was moving. The figure started creeping over towards me slowly. I didn't know what to do. I knew I needed to get the hell out of there. I figured the only way to get out of this was to make a break for it. I took a deep breath and shot up and started sprinting back to my house. I looked back. The person stopped moving. They all didn't move. They still stood there. Watching. But I didn't care. I ran and ran until I reached my house, threw open the back door and slammed it behind me.

I pressed my body against the back door and slid down to the floor, trying to catch my breathe and comprehend what I just experienced. I was about to get up and call the cops. Until I felt something slide underneath me. Still being on edge, it startled me. I fell forward and backed away from the door. Before I looked down to see what it was, I checked the back window. There was nobody out there. I looked at the floor where I felt the sliding. A wrinkled paper where I'd been sitting. I kneeled down and turned it over. I felt like vomiting again when I saw what it read. "We know what you saw" I dropped the paper out of fear and watched it float to the ground.

I was so freaked out, I didn't even call the cops. I ran upstairs to my room and sat on the floor by my bed. It's like I was frozen. I couldn't get off the floor. I couldn't get into my bed. As I was trying to calm down I noticed my bedroom window was open. The same side of the house facing the woods. I closed my eyes and put my head into my knees. "This has to be a dream. Wake up! Wake up!" I thought. I was desperately trying to think of what to do when I heard a noise.

 "Woosh"

The sound of paper. Again. I slowly picked my head up and looked near my window. A paper airplane. They're playing with me now. I gathered up my courage and crawled over and picked up the paper airplane and unfolded it. There were violent scribbles all over it. "We know what you saw" written all over the paper. Expect this paper had a weird rotting stench to it. I looked closer and it looked like the paper had been drawn with old blood. I crumpled the paper and tossed it back out the window in spite.

It was thrown back into my window. It was followed by another paper ball being thrown through the window. But it didn't stop there.Tens, what turned into seeming like hundreds were hurled into my bedroom from the opening of my window. I scrambled to get underneath my bed and put my hands over my head to avoid hearing the gentle "thump" sound when the paper balls hit my floor. I waited for what seemed like days. After about 10 minutes I didn't hear the sound anymore. I took my hands off my ears and peaked out from the low hanging bedsheets. Piles and piles of the papers on my floor. Each seeming to be soaked in blood. But something new appeared. What looked like blood trickling down my wall coming from my window. I got up from under my bed and my stomach began to turn again.

Written all over the walls in blood. "We know what you saw." There were bloody footprints all over the carpet of my room. Leading everywhere, you couldn't make out a clear footprint trail if you tried. I decided I didn't want anymore of those papers coming through my window let alone anything or anyone else. I shut and locked my window but when I looked outside my window near the wood trail I had ran back from. I realized this would be the room I died in.

I saw the figures that were in the woods. It wasn't just the three of them. There were so many more. There were so many that it looked like they had formed a circle around my entire home. They all wore red cloacks expect for three. Three of them wore black ones with red ends on the sleeves. I'm assuming those are the guys I saw in the woods, watching me. They held up papers, with their arms hoisted in the air, as if they were presenting me with the message on the papers. Again, in big, red, bold letters, it read the same dreaded phrase.

"We know what you saw"

They brought their arms back down to the side of their body and dropped the paper. Simultaneously, they all started slowly walking towards my house, maintaining the circle formation. I locked my bedroom door. I got back under my bed and am currently panicking writing this. I don't know what to do. I'm sure this is some cult, and them putting that body there was an act to lure someone in. I don't know if I was intended to be that someone or what. But I know I'm gonna be dead soon. Then I'll be just another body in the woods.

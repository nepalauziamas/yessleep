At first, I was just nervous about how my parents would feel. There comes a time in a one’s life when being terrified of nightmares even after you know it’s all a dream is no longer acceptable, and senior year of high school is well past that point. I do have some excuse—narcolepsy is a bitch. Imagine if at any point during class you could look down and suddenly realize you showed up to school naked, you’re missing the ten page assignment due today, and you’re scheduled to go to a class in a room you can’t find. Eventually you learn a few tricks; the typical rules you’ve read online for dreams usually apply. When light switches work you’re not dreaming, when you’re dreaming text is hard to read. But when it can happen at any time, you’d be rattled even with the best system in the world.

Then, I was afraid of how they might overreact. My family has a very minor history of mental illness, but with how neurotic my mom gets about my health, I know she’d stay up late worrying and demand a full psychological battery on me if I really kept insisting that I didn’t dream this. Frankly, I was slightly worried that they might find something.

But honestly, I was mostly worried about my privacy. Given my propensity to fall over stone cold at any time of day, my parents had every lock taken out of the house. After a cluster of unfortunate situations when I was about 12 where some people forgot to knock, I finally got my parents to agree to a lock on the bathroom door. At 16, I got the lock on my bedroom door back. If they thought my issue was suddenly getting worse after so many years of getting better, that might change.

But none of that matters now, after the party. Every year when the summer heat is just starting to die down, everyone on my block comes out for a potluck. There’s a bouncy house (or moon bounce, if you’re some kind of east coast elite) for the younger kids, spontaneous water fights, and a good deal of drinking by the parents. It’s one of those traditions where no one really knows how it started and no one especially looks forward to it, but it’s still a fun enough time where everyone leaves happy to have some community.

Now, I said no one especially looks forward to it, but that’s not entirely true. At least one person does: my dad. This requires some explaining. When I was very young, I loved Kermit the Frog. I spent all year talking about having a Kermit themed birthday party and asked my parents over and over to help me write a letter to the muppets asking Kermit to attend. Somehow, my dad acquired a full-body Kermit suit, and not only was that the best birthday party a four year old ever had, an annual tradition of the suit being taken out for the block party and hearing about how excited I got when Kermit showed up for the first time was born. Kermit was never supposed to have the dimensions of a fully grown man, and it showed—the thing would have been downright creepy were it not for dad’s constant sound effects added to every movement. But my dad must have hit his stride there, because now every year he shows up to the block party clad in the suit, armed with guacamole and green velvet cake, ready to tell every kid on the block about just how difficult it is being green. It’s easy to hate a parent that does something like that, but when you see him squint with tears of laughter behind the mesh eyes while kids roll on the grass laughing at this weird, goofy frog-man with a silly, squeaky voice, you feel like he really loved raising you. 

This year was the same general affair. Three songs of wildly different genres blasting on three different speakers down the block. Kids screaming laughing as my dad flails his arms around like a muppet being dragged offstage. And lots of beer—or in the younger crowd’s case, RC—consumed. It’s fun for the first few hours, but global warming must be real because this year it was not getting any cooler as the sun went down. Deciding to drink something that wasn’t carbonated, I went up the empty driveway back to my house for some water. I spent a few minutes at the sink when my dad walked in the front door, still clad in a suit obviously worse for wear this year, with an empty platter. 

“Hey dad, do we have any extra guacamole? I asked, to which my mom called up from the basement, “Check in the fridge, he ran to the store to pick up some more beer.”

I stopped. The car was gone when I got here. I looked down and saw his keys gone from the counter. And then I heard a clink as an empty platter got set down five feet from me. I turned, my blood cold, as the Kermit suit stared back at me. My breath caught in my throat as it silently leaned back, arms outstretched as if to comically offer a hug. I stared at the mesh eyes and saw nothing but solid black mass.

I screamed and sprinted to the bathroom as this grotesque thing followed me, silently matching my pace. I slammed the door and locked it, hyperventilating, looking for something, anything, to, I don’t know, fight back? I grabbed the counter and then my chest and the door pounded and then I woke up.

I was in my bed. My mom was there. She said she came back to the house for a quick shower and found me passed out in the bathroom. I bolted up when she said that, almost thinking what I dreamt was real. I told her I had a nightmare, we agreed that whatever college I ended up going to needed RAs trained in how to help a narcoleptic. I had a hard time getting to bed after that, imagining all the possible permutations of my dream whenever I closed my eyes, thinking about how much more real it felt than my usual nightmares. I stayed up late with my door solidly locked and the lights in my room on.

But for everything that I was afraid of saying at first, I’m absolutely terrified of making any noise that might indicate someone else is in the house now.

Because when I walked out of my room to use the bathroom, I saw it again. I ran to the bathroom again. I’m locked in here again. The light switch is working. I’m dead awake. 

And my parents’ door doesn’t lock.

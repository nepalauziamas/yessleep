I've been working at my local hotel for quite some time now and not once has anything out of the ordinary ever occurred. Maybe seeing the occasional person walk out of their room at midnight and catching them doing something odd could count but nothing overall serious. It's kind of a boring job but on the bright side, I get to be on my phone most of the time and scroll through my Twitter and Instagram feeds, so I can continue being caught up on stuff. Tonight was different though.

It started just like any other night. I walk into the hotel when it's dark and walk up a few floors to go into my office. My office is quite a bit away from rooms and suites so I can talk on the phone or whatever without having to worry about waking people up. The hotel closes at 12 so there isn't anybody else working at this time but it's weird because you can check out at the front desk if you're planning on leaving after 12. It's odd but I don't worry about it too much.

I start my nightly routine by just flipping through different cameras real quick to make sure they're working, which they were. I didn't expect anything to start happening for a while so I pulled out my phone and checked the time. It was 12:03. My shift ends around 5, right as the hotel opens but sometimes they let me go at 4, so I never have that long of a shift.

When I put my phone away so I could actually focus on what my job is supposed to be for a minute, I felt as if the hotel was more eerie and dark tonight, more so than it ever is. Something didn't feel right but I ignored it and stared at the front desk camera for a few seconds as the vent on the roof of my office turned on.

The front desk camera shows the desk with the wall behind it. The wall has a lot of expression to it, with multiple picture frames and accessories on it. You have the front glass door and the waiting chairs beside the desk. It was a good view of the room so if anyone was trying to hide, I could easily find where they were.

I flipped to the next camera, which is the storage room. There are just a ton of boxes in this room with some open space, it's not an interesting room to look at whatsoever. I flipped to the next camera.

The next camera was the big dining room. There are a lot of tables and an abundance of sections for seasonings, toppings, and desserts that you can get for yourself. This means that the next camera is of course the kitchen. It's pretty much a standard kitchen with a freezer in the back with its door open. I never actually noticed the freezer like this before but I didn't bother looking closer because I figured the door was always open at night.

"Why do I continue working here," I grumble to myself. I flip to the next camera.

I flipped to the next camera, which-

***BANG.***

I nearly jump out of my seat. There was a bang that sounded like it was coming from the kitchen that I heard from the camera. It was so loud that the sound came out distorted from the speakers and nearly blew my eardrums out. I turned the speaker volume down to make sure I wouldn't wake anyone up. I flipped back to the kitchen camera to check the noise out.

I... didn't see anything. The kitchen looked the same. I took a closer look. Nothing was knocked over. Everything looked the same.

***Knock.***

I heard a slight knocking noise. At first I couldn't tell where it was coming from, it was hard to locate but then I heard it again, and this time I was able to direct it to the freezer.

I stared at the freezer and tried to zoom the camera in to look inside to see what was causing the noises but I didn't see anything, it was just pitch dark in there.

"The fuck?" I murmur. I listen closely to see if any more noises begin but I don't hear anything else. It's quiet now, but almost too quiet.

I zoom out from the freezer to get a whole view of the kitchen to make sure it wasn't coming from anywhere else but I didn't see anything, the kitchen was empty, there wasn't anything in there to cause any noises.

I flip to the dining room camera to see if it wasn't coming from in there and I still didn't see anything. Nothing was knocked over or anything.

I was starting to think I was just hearing things and I was being stupid but I heard ANOTHER noise coming from the kitchen. I flip back to the kitchen camera and look frantically but still, there was nothing in there that I could see. At this point, I knew there was someone- or *something,* in here. But at the same time, I couldn't be sure because there still wasn't anything that I could see anywhere in there.

I redirect my focus to the freezer. The sounds had to have been coming from in there, there was no other way. The freezer was so dark though, so I couldn't tell. I wanted to go down to the kitchen to check it out because I could technically do that if I wanted to.

***Blip***

I heard my phone ring in my pocket. I cussed at myself from the current situation and pulled my phone from my pocket to see who was calling me. My best friend Jeremy was calling me. I sigh as I pick up and put him on speaker.

**"What's up man, you at work?"** Jeremy starts speaking into the phone, surprisingly pretty energetic, considering it was 12 in the morning.

"Uh, yeah..." I say into the phone, still paying close attention to the camera.

**"You sound tired. You good? Something going on?"** Jeremy says, a little more serious now.

I rub my face. I was already getting tired and I wasn't even a quarter into my shift yet.

"Yeah, I'm fine... I'm just hearing noises coming from the kitchen in the camera and I'm trying to figure out what it is but I don't see shit,"

**"You sure you looked everywhere in the camera?"**

"I'm sure,"

**"Maybe it's nothing, you're probably just hearing things,"**

"Wait, why'd you call me?"

**"I know nothing happens on your shift so I figured I'd call ya to get you through it but I guess something is happening now,"**

It's silent for a moment as I sit back in my chair and just think. This didn't make any sense, I keep my phone in my hand while I lean back up and keep looking.

**"I mean, I could just go if you'd like so you can get back to work-"**

"No, we can stay on call if you want,"

**"I guess- okay.  I can help too, I don't have experience in this field though so dunno how much I'll-"**

***Scratch, Scratch***

There was another noise in the kitchen. I immediately snap back alert and look around in the kitchen, what the fuck was making these noises?

"Jeremy, you heard that right?"

**"What the fuck, yeah I heard that,"**

I continue looking and I start thinking that the only solution to find out what it is was to go down and check it out myself. Not something I wanted to do, as this was getting extremely creepy but I probably had to do it.

"Listen, I'm gonna go down and check it out myself, I can't see anything on this camera,"

I open the bottom drawer of my desk and look for my flashlight, but there was so much junk in there that my flashlight was hard to navigate.

"Damn it, it's gonna take me a minute to find my flashlight..."

**"Put me on facetime real quick, I can look so nothing goes out of sight,"**

I think about it and figure out why not. I go into the call and switch it to a facetime call and turn my camera on.

**"Wow it's dark in your office,"** Jeremy laughs. I don't laugh back so Jeremy stops slowly and awkwardly.

"...Yeah, but here, you can look, but you're not gonna see anything,"

I flip the phone camera so Jeremy can take a look at the camera. I hold my phone up so he can continue looking while I lean down to look for my flashlight in the drawer. I listen to Jeremy hum as I move my hand around in the drawer, moving papers around. I don't know what I did with it last night but it seemed to not be on the bottom drawer. I started to get frustrated and I opened and looked through the middle drawer-

**"What the fuck is that?"**

I perked my head up quickly. "Huh?"

**"Look at the camera right now, dude,"**

I raise my body and looked at the camera, and I saw what Jeremy was talking about.

In the freezer, I saw what looked like a person, but their eyes were an immense white color, almost glowing and looming off the camera. I saw them move their body around as they started staring directly *at the camera.*

**"Don't go down there, I-"** Jeremy shakingly stops mid-sentence.

"I have to, I have to get them out, it's my job. I can't just let them stay in the freezer dude," I continue looking for my flashlight but I keep looking at the camera, not letting whatever it was out of my sight. It was still staring at the camera, almost staring right at me.

**"I'm telling you right now, that thing is not a human,"**

"It's just a guy with bright eyes, I can get him out of here,"

**"Have you ever seen a man with those kinds of eyes? Think about that. I don't think this thing is a human, don't risk it,"**

"I have to, it's my job, you're just overreacting- Hold on, what the fuck?"

I keep my phone pointed at the camera but I slowly lower it as whatever was in the freezer starts to reveal itself.

A lanky figure that looked like it had black goo for skin stepped out of the freezer, continuing to stare at the camera. It had a mouth but it didn't have a nose, and for being lanky, it looked like it had some muscle in its arms. Jeremy was right, It wasn't human, it had spikes on its back and its eyes were unnaturally white. It was almost hard to look at. It looked like its skin was almost drooping.

I was lost for words, paralyzed in fear, unable to let any words out. I wasn't sure what I was looking at.

I was finally able to say something; "Jeremy, are- are you seeing this?"

**"I gotta go. I'm sorry, I can't stay on this call, but take my word; don't go down to the kitchen! I don't care if it's your job, I don't want you dying,"**

Jeremy then hung up, abruptly.

I slam my phone down on the table, my best friend had left me all alone to deal with this thing and I didn't know what to do. It was still staring at the camera and I looked back at it, not able to do anything else. It was like someone had frozen me in time. Time in general felt frozen. I was going to listen to Jeremy though, no way in hell I was going down there. I didn't care if I lost my job.

I wanted to cry though, I wanted to curl up in my seat and just quietly sob. I was basically powerless in this situation. This creature was making me feel powerless in itself by simply looking at the camera. It had no expression on its face, no movement, not doing anything, just *staring,* like it was actively looking through the camera lens, right at me.

I watch as the creature finally opened its mouth and formed a crooked, sinister smile. Its teeth were ragged but sharp and nasty, like they haven't been brushed in years. They almost looked like wood. It was an ugly smile, and it looked horrific.

When it finally stopped looking at the camera, it just turned around and started walking around the kitchen in circles, around the middle counter. It was staring ahead as it paced, but even with the random movement, it looked like it knew what it was doing in a way. It was freaky and disturbing, and my heart was beating fast because I also felt like everyone else in the hotel was in danger.

In that moment of thought, I heard quiet footsteps coming from the entrance of the dining room. I looked at the creature one last time and it was doing the same thing. I flipped to the dining room camera briskly and saw at the entrance of the dining room a little boy walking in, looking around, clueless.

I knew the kitchen was right next to the dining room and this boy was in serious danger. I didn't know what the creature was capable of, I didn't know if it would do anything but I didn't want to take any chances. It didn't look like there were any adults around, this kid just waltzed in. The sounds must've lured him in.

I looked down at the bottom drawer again and took a box cutter I saw and stuck it in my back pocket. I wasn't going to listen to Jeremy anymore because I couldn't bear to see a little kid in the same room as a monster, especially knowing what the consequences might be. I didn't continue looking for my flashlight. I opened my office door and peaked out. Every door on the floor was closed. People were still asleep.

I breathed a sigh of relief as I tiptoed out of my office and down the hall, towards the stairs. I looked at the stairs; the staircase lead directly down to the bottom floor.

I put my foot on the first step, making a loud creaking sound.

I winced but continued down with no issue. My heart was pounding, feeling like it was going to explode any second. I wasn't doing this to be a hero, I was doing this so nobody would die tonight.

I didn't want to die either but I also figured that this is my job; even if I didn't sign up for shit like this. I walked to the dining room door and started to hold my breath. I walked faster towards the door and walked in cautiously. I looked at the open kitchen and saw the creature still walking around the counter, still staring ahead but it was walking a little slower now.

I stepped back in fear, not wanting to go in anymore but if it didn't see the boy walking around, it probably wouldn't see me, right?

The creature was mumbling something but it didn't sound like words; it sounded like raspy noises, like he was trying to talk but he can't put together words. It didn't sound normal.

I slowly walk into the dining room, fearing for my life as I start to walk across the entire dining room, looking for the boy but keeping my eye on the creature at the same time. I try my hardest to not cause a creak in the floor because I didn't know if the creature would hear it and go after me or not. I took another look at it. It walked around the counter multiple times without seeing me.

I look closely for the boy as I hear the creature's movement slow down more as I turn the corner to the other side of the dining room. I see the little boy in the middle of this side, staring directly at the creature in awe, like he was admiring it. My eyes widen as I look at the boy, and at this point, he had seen me and directed his attention to me as he smiles.

"Hey, mister! How are you?" The boy says loudly at me.

My heart drops and I look at the creature, who is now not moving and is now directly staring at the boy. I don't say anything back to the boy, instead standing in fear, the creature now walking out the side kitchen door towards the boy.

I know something horrible was going to happen to him if I didn't do anything. I reach into my back pocket and grab the box cutter. The creature was now out of the kitchen and he was taking slow, steady steps towards the boy as I take one last look and throw the box cutter at it.

The blade of the cutter hits the creature across the face and he instantly stops all of his movement. The boy was now looking face to face with the creature, his face a mixture of excitement and terror, and I could see what looked like blood coming from the side of the creature's face.

It wasn't looking at the boy for long, as it started to slowly turn its head towards me, its bright white eyes were like daggers looking at me, and I knew I was its target now. Looking at the box cutter to the other side of it on the floor, it then looked back at me and gave me a snarl.

It gargled at me as it started to chase me on both feet to my surprise.

I react quickly and started running as fast as I could towards the front kitchen curtains. This thing wasn't that fast but I knew it could catch up to me if I slow down just once. I heard it move even closer towards me, if I hadn't intercepted it as quick as I did, I might be dead right now.

I had goosebumps on my arms as I blasted through the curtains and ran towards the freezer, which was closed now. I opened the freezer as fast as I could, but when I tried opening it, the door got stuck.

"Shit!" I say, trying to force it open but it wasn't budging. It takes me a couple of seconds but I eventually open it as the freezing air hits my face like a pile of rocks.

The creature meets me in the kitchen and I meet it face to face. It was even more hideous and terrifying up close. I went to grab it but this thing was strong, the creature grabs me and throws me into the freezer as it raspily yells at me. I hit a metal cabinet back first and fall to the ice-cold floor, getting the wind knocked out of me.

I was in pain but I was also so cold, I needed to get out of there, but once I got back to my knees, I heard the freezer door close and click, signifying that it had been locked. I got up and went to the door and tried opening it but it was no use. The creature must've locked it, he had to have been in here multiple times if he knew how to lock it.

I started coughing from the cold and I started panicking because I knew I was going to die in here from hypothermia if I couldn't get out. I heard the creature moving in the kitchen and I felt defeated but it was hard to decipher anything out there with the cold air deafening my ears.

I put my head down and tried thinking but just a second later, the freezer door opened and I saw the little boy in front of the freezer, his hand on the handle.

"Quick, mister, get out!" He says urgently.

I was surprised but I also listened and got out. I didn't see the creature at first, yet I felt its presence in the kitchen still. I look around for a second before going.

"Come on, we have to get out," I say to the boy, starting to run out of the kitchen before I hear heavy commotion coming from behind me. Before I went out of the kitchen, I turned around and saw the creature holding the little boy by the neck.

Before I could do or say anything, I watch as the creature sticks its hand down the boy's throat and rip his vocal cords right out of his body like he was pulling plugs from a tv.

The creature lets the boy fall to the floor as the boy starts coughing and crying.

I start shaking uncontrollably... I didn't want to move. It was like I didn't know *how* to move. I look at the little boy on the floor, who was curled up in a ball, then back up at the creature. I look at his hand and see the boy's vocal cords laid out in his palm.

The creature raises the vocal cords as he opens his mouth and sticks the boy's vocal cords down his mouth.

I watch in disgust as I watch him move his hand around in his throat and finally pull his hand out. The creature looks at me and I hear him clear its throat and I realize; the creature couldn't speak before.

The creature continues clearing his throat before finally saying something to me. I close my eyes in fear.

"*You shouldn't of come down here...*"

The creature speaks in a deep, raspy, monstrous tone, setting fear in me as I try to search for words to say, but I didn't know how to respond.

I start hearing multiple footsteps outside of the dining room. The creature looks at the wall, then back at me. The creature leans down and grabs the boy by the foot.

The creature proceeds the chuck the kid down towards my feet as he continues crying. I jump at the impact the throw made as I slowly back up out of the kitchen, my mouth agape.

"I... Just... Wanted to speak,"

I hear the creature start making disgusting, weird noises while clearing his throat. Right as the doors to the dining room swing open, I hear the creature skitter away, out the other dining room door and only God knows where else.

I turn around and see multiple people, maybe 5-6 of them, all in the dining room, looking at me.

"Are you the night guard?" A middle-aged man says to me, looking at my uniform. I nod my head.

"Um, I... Yes, I... I am,"

"What the hell was going on down here? We heard all kinds of noises," The same man says.

"Well, you see..." I couldn't even explain what happened. I hear the boy start crying louder and everyone's attention goes toward the kitchen curtain. A woman in the back of the small crowd goes towards the kitchen and goes in. I get nervous and helpless about everything that transpired and I hear her gasp. I put my head down and sit down on the floor as everyone else rushes in to see the boy.

"You monster!"

The woman starts yelling at me as she carries the boy out, looking at me with nothing but hatred in her eyes. "What did you do to my son?"

I look at her. "Ma'am, I... I did nothing to your son. Something else..." I don't finish my sentence.

"We'll see what the cops say about that,"

The police did end up showing up and they immediately started questioning me. At that point, almost everyone in the hotel was out of their rooms and asking everyone else questions. Even the manager of the hotel was called to come by. The vibe was dark and gross when most people started figuring out how the little boy's vocal cords were ripped out of his throat, but the bad part is, people started thinking that *I* did it.

I told the cops the whole story but the whole time, they looked pretty skeptical at what I was saying, looking at me like I was some sort of lunatic. I even told them that everything was on camera. They told me to show them.

I lead them to my office and to the computer where everything would be stored. I clicked play on tonight's camera recordings... No data saved.

"What?" I say. I feel the cop's eyes moving onto me by the second. I click out and click on the day's date again to go back in but again, it says no data saved. This didn't make any sense, how could the footage not be saved?

"Yeah, I think we've seen enough," one of the cops says.

"There has to be some way we can recover the footage," I say but the cops grab me and take me away from the computer.

"Sorry, but the family already wants to press charges. Even if your weird story is true, you won't be able to get out of it,"

&#x200B;

So here I am, sitting and writing this while waiting to hear a court date, feeling helpless because everyone is against me and doesn't believe me. My question though is, how was the footage not saved? The only way that could've happened was that someone manually went in and deleted it all, which never happens. Nothing made sense, but I still have hope that there is some way to recover the footage so I can show people.

Even with that aside, I still have to live with the fact that I let a boy's vocal cords get ripped out by a disgusting monster, I had to *watch* it happen, and something that terrifies me even more is that the creature is still out there, and I don't know where it is right now, but I pray that I don't run into it anywhere else.

I got fired from my night guard job at the hotel and I got trespassed too so if it's back there again, then I'm for sure not gonna see it, but whoever the next night guard is most likely will.

I hope I'm not coming off as crazy, and I'm not sure if anyone on here will believe me but in case you don't, think about this; how can a regular guy stick his hand down a boy's mouth and rip vocal cords out? That's not a natural thing to do, that's something only a supernatural thing can do.

It's even scarier knowing that the creature was probably lying in wait the whole time. Its whole goal in the first place most likely was to steal someone's vocal cords, I mean, it wasn't even saying anything before, and it's gonna be scary sleeping at night knowing I was supposed to be the victim. I don't know though, and I don't know if I do want to figure out it's goal.

The boy can't tell the same story either because he can't speak, it would take way too long for him to be able to speak again but I've heard that he might not make it.

I hope he does make it but after that throw that sadistic creature did, the impact and the force it had, I won't be surprised if the boy dies in the hospital today.

The creature is still on my mind. I can't get it out of my head, it's like it's feeding on and infesting my brain, manifesting its image into my mind forever, and I just have to live with this night, and I might be in debt, or perhaps maybe even jail, but I have a good lawyer so I might be fine, but my public image will never be the same again.

I know Jeremy believes me but what can he do to change this? I don't think he took a screenshot of my facetime video, I even asked him.

Even with the trauma I most likely have to face and living in fear from the creature, I guess this serves as a lesson to me and everyone else reading this;

**Never become a night guard.**

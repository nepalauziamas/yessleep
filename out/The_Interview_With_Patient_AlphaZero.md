"If you could sit there in front of us and speak clearly for the microphone please, Lieutenant."


"Wait, I thought we were doing this Live on tv?"


"We are don't worry. We just need to document your story first and have all the information before we can go Live. Okay?"


"No! I told you on the phone, if you want to change your life and career forever, we do this Live, or not at all."


"Okay-Okay! Fine!...We'll do it your way...Okay, here we go...:My name is Kathy Green, with me is Dennis Sands, welcome to News International. We are currently in a secret location with a Lieutenant James after he contacted us for an exclusive. He is about to tell us an alleged secret which is currently being backed *and* covered-up by our government. Lieutenant, would you mind stating your name and government number for the record please?"


"Lieutenant Marcus James, 12113998."


"Thank you. So, Lieutenant, please...tell us your story."


"Well, I've been in the services for 38 years, Lieutenant for the last twelve. Six months ago, I was transferred to a silent government agency, and the knowledge I have come by absolutely needs to be made public."


"What do you mean by, silent agency?"


"Erm...think of it as, underground laboratories."


"And what exactly have you witnessed in these laboratories?"


"Horrific things...I mean, they were incredible, but, *horrific.* The agency had been attempting to create a superhuman."


"A *superhuman?"*


"Yes."


"Did they...succeed?"


"...Yes."


"Do you have any proof?"


"I do. And I will show you soon."


"No problem. Sorry, please continue."


"They tested on him for weeks. He was strapped to a table the entire time. They changed his drip bag that was filled with experimental drugs every six hours. Each bag contained a different strain. They never thought that their very first candidate would be a complete success...Patient A-0. They sent him out in the field for more tests, building up his endurance and pushing the limits. The final test was to gauge how many bullets the superhuman would be able to withstand, and locations of the body which could handle more impacts and injuries....he absorbed 46 rounds all over his body, barring the head and heart."


*"And he survived?!"*


"He did. And not only did he survive, but he fully recovered from all of his injuries after just six hours."


"That--that really is incredible."


"His rage and ever-building ego was a massive problem, though. Being human and knowing you're pretty much indestructible...it's a very dangerous thing."


"Did they manage to keep him under control?"


"They did, but, only until *I* discovered the major flaw. I did the test myself...I had to. *I just had to know*...I tested on the heart with a knife...then I tested on the head with a bullet..."


"...And?"


"And...*I survived*..."


The lieutenant's teeth somehow grew on command into a perfect set. Perfect for tearing through veins and nerves and chewing through sinew. The harrowing screams from the reporters only ceased when the camera turned black, and the Live stream finally cut back to the studio.

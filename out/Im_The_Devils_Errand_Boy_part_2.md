The steam of the hot coffee rolled off the foam cup, the smell was pure heaven, but the taste was crap, no matter how much sugar or creamer I tried to put in the gas station coffee, it still tasted like sludge, but it was better than nothing. snacks go along way too, my stomach couldn’t stop growling from the long drive over the county, forty-five-minute drive was far too long for me. 

The two-story house loomed in the horizon, the sun wasn’t even ready to rise, the darkness still blanketed the city. The only reason why I was parked in this suburban with cookie cutter houses was because The Devil himself sent me on an errand to retrieve a guitar, Albert O’Brian had made a deal with the devil and couldn’t keep his end of the deal. So here I am, here to recollect, I’m starting to think this wasn’t going to be easy. 

Houses nearby were starting to turn on their lights, I hadn’t been discovered as of yet, I was slouching low in the driver seat so no one could see me. I sipped on my coffee which left a bad taste in my mouth, to be honest I’d rather go to bed. But I had less then three hours to retrieve the guitar and go home, which I wasn’t sure I wanted to. Charlie, my stepdad, had been leaving me nasty voicemails over the last forty-five minutes about how I don’t care about my mom because I’m not at the hospital. He doesn’t even know it was my fault for my mother’s condition. Whatever, I’ll do what I can here and head back to the hospital. I guess no sleep for me, that’s by me. 

*Shoot*. I better focus on my target’s house less I screw this up. it was midnight already. I should have had a plan already, but I don’t, breaking an entering into a man’s home didn’t seem ideal to me. knocking on his door wasn’t a good idea either, what am I going to say? *hi, I’m the devil repo man, I’m here to take back that guitar because you didn’t hold up your end of the bargain.* Then what, he’d either comply or I’d get shot. The thought of getting shot and not being able to go to a hospital for it, didn’t sit well with me. I could feel the mood in my car unsettling. But it had to be done somehow. 

I stared at the house a good long minute, too long, imagining what I could do to get in and get that damn guitar, I was wasting time. I took one last swig of the coffee for confidence, slowly I got out of my car and headed up the driveway of Mr. O’Brian’s home. It was really nice, something my parents would enjoy owning, the neighborhood was quiet, but it could be just as bad as my neighborhood. For all I know there is a neighborhood watch, and they were waiting for me to slid open the window of this house. but as soon as I walked up to the door, something felt off. and rancid, the smell was beyond my comprehension. I took a step back, I covered my nose, the smell was bad. Glancing at the front windows, the curtains were drawn shut. 

“Hey, who are you?” 

I glanced at a smoking hot chick walking her big black Pitbull, I paused as I stared at her. I knew I was going to get caught, what am I supposed to say? with that smell I’m surprised no one called a healthy inspector, it smelt like a sewerage wafting off the house. I didn’t smell it until now, how no one in the neighborhood could smell it was beyond me. I was having a hard time responding, seeing my throat was closing up from the smell and the anxiety that this chick was going to call the cops on me. 

The woman could be long lost twin for Marilyn Monroe, she had electric blue hair her hair cut in the same style as Marilyn Manroe. She wore a Neko Mancer shirt with black spiderweb leggings and combat boots, and a sterling-silver septum piercing with a jeweled bat hanging off the middle of it. her lips were painted a dark burgundy red that looked like dried blood than lipstick, and her black liquid eyeliner curled up to sharp deadly points of her green eyes. 

I was startled by her beauty and her being here, so I do have a thing for goths, who doesn’t? probably why I had a crush on my friend Esme, shaking myself out of it. I said the first thing that popped into my head. “I’m a health inspector.” I wanted to face palm myself at that exact moment. 

She squinted at me, “its midnight.” 

I shoved my hands into my hoodie, “yes well, the city was so concerned for the smell that’s coming off of Mr. O’Brian’s house, they immediately wanted me to check it out. so here I am. ready to knock on his door.” 

The woman scowled, “so someone finally called the city? Everyone has been complaining about his house, it smells like a sewer, we were all worried you know he might have died, but we saw him leaving earlier to work, not sure if he came back though.” She walked up towards me; her dog didn’t seem to be threatening but who knows? I kept my distance from her. “Let’s talk to him together, I’m Jade, what’s your name?” she held her fishnet hands out to me. 

I shook her soft hand, “Wallace.” I wasn’t going to give her my full name, less she finds out I’m not a health inspector, weird she’d believe me. usually, Esme could tell when I was lying and would call me out on it. Jade seemed nice, hopefully she doesn’t catch on I’m here to steal something. 

Turning back to the door, slammed my fist against the door, yelling out Health Inspector, we waited for a good solid five minutes before I slammed fist against the door once more. the door slowly creaked open, the putrid smell crawled out, nearly knocking us to the ground. I put my hand over my nose and mouth, Jade’s dog started to growl at the door. She yanked on his leash and hushed him. slowly I pushed the door open with my free hand, it was dark inside, there was no visible light not even from the outside in. 

“You think it’s a good idea to go into his house without him knowing?” she asked suspiciously. 

“Maybe he opened it?” I called out to him. “Mr. O’Brian, my name is Wallace, the city sent me to check in on your home, the stench from your house has been disturbing the neighbors!” but there was no reply, that feeling I got when the Devil appeared came back. that twisted gut feeling, the chill that ran down my spine. Something was seriously wrong; I can feel it deep down in my bones. I reached my hand inside and found a light switch just at the entrance of the door, I flicked it on, but the light didn’t turn on. 

I reached in my pocket and pulled out my phone and switched the flashlight app on and shun it inside the foyer, Jade gasped as she saw what I did. blood smeared a crossed the floor and walls that lead into the house. she backed up. she grabbed my shoulder and dug her black nails into it. 

“We should call the cops.”

“Go ahead, I’m going in.” I took in a deep breath hoping I wasn’t walking in on a murder scene. Jade stayed out on the porch as I slowly walked in. the smell got worse, I wasn’t sure if was because someone died, or if Mr. O’Brian was alive or not. Slowly I flashed my light around, blood smeared across the walls and floor, the foyer opened up to a staircase that led upstairs, to my right was the living room and to my left looked like an entertainment room. I walked towards the living room, the couches were tossed to the around, lamps lay shattered on the floor, more blood smeared everywhere, looked like there was a trail of it. witch each step I took, my foot crunched on debris that had been smashed on the ground, I glanced the flashlight to the windows where the curtains were drawn, inside I could see blood coated it like a blanket. I tried to breath through the rancid smell that seemed to stick to me now that I was inside. 

As I slowly explored the house, my wrist suddenly started to burn, the one with the tattoo, I hissed as I peeled my hand away from mouth and nose. I stared at the tattoo as it glowed red, it felt like my wrist was on fire. I hissed in pain and shook my wrist; I wasn’t sure if that was a good sign or not. Then I saw what I was after, the red guitar that laid on the floor, it too was covered in blood, and something black, like some type of oil. Slowly I crouched down to grab the neck, when I heard something that sounded a lot like clicking and slithering. As if there was a giant bug behind me. 

I closed my eyes, and hoped I was wrong, I glanced over my shoulder and flashed the light in that general direction, and I swallowed down a scream that lodged itself in my throat. It had to be at least eight to ten feet long, with more then a thousand legs, a centipede that curled around the walls of the living room, with its pinchers clacking together, but it was the face of it that caused me to pause. It was a man’s face, he the pinchers grown out of his mouth, and antennae’s that flicked out of his head. His eyes narrowed on me as I had one hand stretched out to the guitar. 

“Hi there,” I said in a shaky voice. 

“*He sent you to collect, didn’t he?”* he hissed, if anyone heard him speaking all they could hear was clicking and hissing coming from him. for some reason I could understand him, and I didn’t know why or how. 

Slowly nodding my head, “he did, I’m sorry,” my voice broke in terror. “But I have to bring back the guitar, you didn’t hold your end of the bargain.” 

*“LIAR!”* 

I flinched as he yelled, slowly I picked up the guitar and wrapped the strap over my front, so the guitar sat at my back. “I don’t know what happened to you, but I have a job to do. I won’t do anything else but take this guitar…” 

In a sudden move he slammed his entire body into mine throwing me up against the kitchen sink, pain erupted through my entire body, I screamed as I fell to the ground. the guitar didn’t break, it was sturdy as a freaking brick. My phone was thrown out of my hand, so I was plunged into darkness with this thing, I glanced about letting my eyes adjust to the darkness. Until I saw my phone in the far corner, slowly I crawled towards it, the pain in my back almost caused me to collapse from the pain of it. 

“Is everything okay Wallace?” Jade called from the front porch. 

“Fine,” I coughed out. “I slipped and fell.” I lied. Slowly I crawled towards my phone and picked it up with shaky hands and O’Brian was now in the half in the kitchen and the other half in the living room. He lunged at me once again, I rolled right out of his way and he slammed right into the dry wall, and I managed to push myself back on my feet and inched myself around his centipede body into the living room. something on the back of my neck told me to dodge, which I did in time when his back end nearly took my head off and slammed right into the other wall. I fell over the tipped over couch and groaned. Looking down at myself, my entire hoodie was covered in black tar like oil. Slowly I pushed my aching body back up, when something slammed yanked on the guitar on my back, lifting me three feet off the ground and I dangled there. dropping my phone once again, and I swore under my breath. 

*“I won’t allow you to take what’s mine!”* O’Brian hissed in my face as he rose his head up. his body now coiled in the living room once again. *“you’ll have to kill me if you want to leave alive.”* 

A piece of the wood from the couch stood up right, the end part sharp, I swallowed. As I said, I am not the fighting kind. But when you put someone in this type of situation, there is a no-win situation. I didn’t want to hurt anyone, I just wanted to get the damn guitar to the Devil. This little dark voice inside of me to grab that piece of wood from the couch and stab Mr. O’Brian in the neck or face. problem was I couldn’t reach it unless I undid the strap and he’d get the guitar. 

I looked him directly in the face, “can’t we talk this out?” hoping for a less violent way to get this done. 

Instead of answering me he threw me, lodged me across the house into the entertainment room smashing right into a giant flat screen tv with the guitar still strapped around me. I felt something hot and liquid running down my face, I touched it and it smelt like iron. I had a bad feeling I was bleeding, but I had to put that aside. Just as O’Brian lodged another attack at me, I grabbed the nearest object, a freaking bowl of fruit, I groaned in irritation and threw it at him he pulled back looking confused as I ran. He slithered and ran with his million legs after me, I screamed as I jumped over a table and nearly face planted. I found myself running up the stairs as he followed in suit. 

I slipped a little on the black oil that coated my entire body now, almost fell down the stairs, I managed to get up on the second landing not without falling face first. The oil on my body was slick and not working in my favor. I ran down the hall and ended up in the bathroom and slammed the door shut. I tried the light switch and of course it wasn’t working. quickly I went through the bathroom trying to find a weapon, there was nothing I could use, nothing. the door to the bathroom started to rattle as O’Brian slammed into the door. His clicking got louder and louder as if this hunt was making him hungry or excited. 

Just as the door burst open, I grabbed a weapon, of course it was a plunger. He held it like a bat, O’Brian came at me again, I ducked in the bathtub and slammed the plunger right into his face, he screamed in disgust. And I managed to slip through the door and his million legs that scratched right through my hoodie and into my skin. I hurriedly past him nearly slipping the entire time. I managed to run down the stairs, and I picked up my phone and ran out of the house and slammed the door shut with Jade staring at me wide eyes. 

“What is going on?!” 

Before I could even answer the front door flew right off the hinges and O’Brian shot out slamming into me and throwing me into the middle of the neighborhood street. He rose his entire body up, screaming in rage. I was out of options; I pushed the automatic dial for the Devil. The moment the phone was answered he appeared a few feet from me and paused as he stared up at the centipede O’Brian. 

“Well, isn’t this unfortunate.” He smirked. 

Suddenly a black hole appeared right under O’Brian and sucked him in like a vacuum, sucking the bug like human creature down into the abyss, he screamed in terror and anger until his entire centipede body was all the way inside the hole closed up as if there was never a centipede monster there in the first place. And the night went still and quiet. 

“Guitar, please.” The Devil held his hand out to me, a silver ring glinted on his middle finger. Slowly I pulled the guitar off me and held it out to him. “I’m thrilled you survived on your first retrieval. Most humans die. fortunately for us both, you survived.” 

“Ha!” I snorted. “that’s what you were worried about if I survived?! Look at me! what the hell was that! I didn’t sign up for that kind of shit! I was just supposed to get a guitar I was not supposed battle whatever hell beast that was.” I snarled at him. 

“Well, as I said he didn’t hold his end of the bargain. His greed got the better of him, so his consequence was to literally turn him into a beast. I am glad you survived, truly. I knew you were special the moment we made our deal.” He smiled like a Cheshire cat. “I’ll text you on your next assignment, go get some rest. Your next errand will be much more difficult than this one.”

“That sounds terrific,” I snarled. “And what the hell is this? what did you put on my wrist? And it burned the moment I found the guitar.” 

The Devil stared at it for a moment, he didn’t look surprised at all. “Oh, once you made a deal with me to work for me, I marked you. Don’t want others to think you are up for grabs.” He winked. “The mark is supposed to warn you of any demons nearby, I thought that might be helpful since the last human who had helped me ended up in pieces.” 

My jaw dropped, “excuse me?” 

“You’re not, but do understand to keep our deal a discretion,” he glanced over at Jade who was shell shocked and was on the ground watching our exchange. “Other humans involved in this is not my responsibility if they stay alive or not. But as a favor this time, I can erase her memory to before she met you, and I will only do this once.” 

I shook my head, “I can’t believe you! You got what you wanted, just leave.” I hissed. 

The Devil sighed and disappeared before the rising sun started to fill the sky. Slowly I walked over to Jade, covered in black oil and I’m sure I was bleeding. I probably looked like crap. I crouched down in front of Jade with her dog, licking my face. I pushed the huge dog away. 

Her lips parted in shock, “what the hell was that?” 

“a demon apparently.” 

“You’re not a health inspector, are you?” 

“Sorry I lied.” She took my hand and I helped her stand up, she looked me up and down, and scrunched her nose at me. “Yeah, I smell like sewer, I’m going to get going.” 

“Wait, you can use my shower before you go,” she said softly. “So um, you’re like a demon hunter or something?” she pushed a strand of hair out of her face. 

I was hesitant like the Devil said, she was not part of this, and that she shouldn’t have been involved, pain racked through my entire body as I moved. I would love a shower and a nap right now. I didn’t want to take advantage of this woman, but I really do stink. “I wouldn’t mind a shower, and no I’m not a demon hunter. I’m just an errand boy, I was just here to get that guitar for the devil and that was it. the demon was not part of the deal.” 

“So, you make a deal with the devil for what, I mean I wouldn’t have believed it if I didn’t witness it.” she nervously giggled. 

“I’m trying to reverse a deal I had with him,” I sighed. as she had me follow her to her house which was exactly where I parked funny. She unlocked her door, and her dog ran inside first and ran to the food bowls and lapped up a lot of water. Slowly I shuffled in, she pointed me in the direction of her bathroom, I nearly ran her over as I ran inside. Once I got inside the bathroom, I could now smell my self even more. *oh, Jesus. I smell like a hot boiled garbage under a hot sun.* so naturally, I immediately projectile vomit into the toilet for the next twenty minutes. 

After I finished, I had turned the entire toilet bowl red from the hot Cheetos I’d eaten earlier and coffee, it didn’t taste good coming back up at all. don’t judge me, I had to grab a snack before facing a demon had I known I’d vomit, I wouldn’t have any hot Cheetos. 

Anyway, I stood up and washed my face, I made the mistake of looking up in the mirror at myself. I was soaked head-to-toe in black slimy oil, my face looked like a punching bag, the right side of my arm what’s left of my black hoodie was my skin puckering out with red cuts and coating the rest of my hoodie in my blood. Then I looked down at my left arm and that’s when I saw something black wiggling sticking out of my arm. *what the hell is that?*

Reaching for it, I nearly screamed out of fear, I panicked as I pulled it out of my arm, pain ruptured through it and I dropped it quickly into the sink, it was one of the centipede legs that got lodged into me. I wanted to vomit again, but I had nothing. my clothes were soaked in the black oil slime, even all the way down into my underpants, it felt like and epic case of swamp ass. I peeled my clothes off and they fell in a very loud splat on the bathroom floor. I turned on the shower and took a quick ten-minute shower getting all the disgusting slim and my own crusted blood off. once I was done, I felt refreshed after that. glancing down at my left arm, it looked like minced meat, opening the cabinets to find a first aid kit, I wrapped my arm and shoulder. Turning in the mirror, my entire back was black and blue, no kidding. I looked like I got in a bad car accident. 

There was a knock on the door, I opened it slightly, “I found some of my boyfriends’ clothes, I’m not sure if it will fit.” Jade sounded unsure. 

I reached out and grabbed the clothes and thanked her, slowly I got dressed, with each movement becoming sluggish, I hissed in pain. well, the Devil can’t say I didn’t put blood in sweat in this assignment. Turns out being the Devil’s errand boy wasn’t as easy he made it out to be. I know it will get worse. I kept thinking about how better my mother could get if I keep going. 

I opened the door and Jade looked me up and down and smiled, “they fit!” she said excitedly. She held a plastic bag out to me, “for your dirty ones.” 

“Thanks,” I mumbled and scooped them up into the bag and nearly vomited again from the rancid smell of it. I turned to her, “I’ll give these back as soon as I can, I do appreciate it.” 

She beamed, “of course, and hey while you’re at it, maybe let me tag along with you on your next…” I lifted an eyebrow at her. “I mean I assume there’s another…. or am I wrong?”

“Well, I’m not really responsible if you get hurt and I…. well, it’s just,” I scratched the back of my head. “Why would you want to?”

Jade rolled her eyes, “because this is exciting, I mean, I watch all sorts of things about demons and the occult and everything. and to see an actual thing, it was exciting and terrifying at the same time. and you could use me, I have great knowledge about demons and the lore alike.” 

I snorted, “yeah… I don’t know… I’ll think about it….” I said softly. 

She held her hand out, “your phone?”

So, I handed it to her, she tapped on the screen for a few minutes and handed it back to me. “What did you do?”

“I put my number in your phone, so you can call me or text, which ever. I free most nights; my classes are mostly mid-morning and afternoon.” 

“Classes?” I slide my phone into the shorts I was wearing. 

“Yeah, I go to college I’m majoring in history and philosophy, I love it. what about you, Wallace, you go to college?”

“Did,” I clipped. “I dropped out; it wasn’t for me.” 

“Oh,” she nodded. 

“I’ll call you,” I lied, I probably won’t. slowly I made my way out of her house with her and her dog following me to the door. The sun was already lighting up the sky, slowly I limped to my car and threw the disgusting clothes in the trunk. I didn’t want that smell attaching itself into my car. I made a quick phone call to the health department on Mr. O’Brian’s house. Charlie was calling me once again; I noticed my phone was nearly dead. I ignored his call, I was exhausted, and in pain. all I wanted was a bed to drop into. 

I’m not heartless, so I drove back into my county, heading straight for the hospital, parking in the guest parking spot I got out. heading inside, glancing at my bandaged arm, I know Charlie will comment on it. I got into the lobby and went to the gift shop, I browsed around until I found a black and grey hoodie, the hood was black and so was the sleeves and the rest of the hoodie was dark grey. It had the hospital logo on the back, but I didn’t mind it. I bought it, as I stood for the elevator to go to my mom’s floor to her room, I pulled the tag off of it. 

“What happened to you?” said a gruff males voice. 

Glancing up I saw Dr. Rosswell, waiting at the elevator too with a clipboard in hand. “I, uh, would you believe me if I got into a car accident or brawl?”

“Car accident,” he commented. 

I nodded, “then car accident it was,” I sighed. “Look I’m fine, I just had a run in on something I’d rather not say. my business and all.” I didn’t want to sound rude, but he didn’t have any rights to know what I was up to. I slipped the hoodie on, it covered most of everything except for my face. I shoved my hands into the hoodie pocket, clearing my throat. 

“Hmm,” he said softly he stared at the clipboard. “If you want me to give you an exam I can,” he said softly and flicked his eyes up at the digital screen to see what floor the elevator was on. “But if you don’t want to, that’s fine too.” 

“Yep, I’m fine.” I looked away, the elevator doors finally opened for us, and we got on. “How my mom doing?”

“Fine, I guess your mother and father decided to not do the surgery, which is fine. But she’ll have to live with this condition with the rest of her life.” 

*Not if I can help it.*  I thought to myself. “What if she can I don’t know get better on her own?” 

He pushed for my mother’s floor, four, and turned to me. “That highly unlikely. I had found a few others with the same condition unfortunately two of them died, and the other one is still alive, he had surgery on his mouth it took him nearly three years to get back to normal.” 

I grunted, “how much?” my tattoo had started to burn, it was slightly when the doctor approached but now it was starting to burn. I pressed my left thumb into my right wrist. Trying to keep me from showing any pain from it. 

“Hmm?” Dr. Rosswell looked at me, and I saw it in a nanosecond. His eyes turned from brown to gold then back to brown. “Well, it could cost millions of course, but the end is always worth it, correct?”

I swallowed as I stared at him. “Yeah . . .” I said softly as I scooted a few feet from him. “So um, are you going to be my mom’s doctor the entire time?”

“Yes, I’m her primary doctor—” he stared at me, and he narrowed his eyes, he sighed. he reached over and I flinched as he pushed for the emergency stop button. Stopping the elevator before it got to the floor, the lights flickered in the elevator. “don’t worry, we won’t be interrupted.”

“I, uh…” stammered, what was there to say, I now am a demon detector, and I am ninety percent sure he’s a demon or there is one on top or below the elevator if that’s the case for my wrist burning. 

“Listen to me well, you are playing a dangerous game, a game you will not win with him. just accept what has happened has happened. Understand?” he stared down at his clipboard and moving the papers on it as if he was looking for something. “He will ruin you, and your entire family. its not too late to stop working for him.” 

“I don’t know what you—” I tried to play it off but her interrupted me. 

“We didn’t have this conversation, is that clear?” and he reached passed me once again, pulling the emergency button and the elevator jolted back online and brought us to the floor. he apologized to the patrons saying the elevator stalled and gave me a look and turned and kept walking. Shaking my head, I wasn’t sure if I imagined it. the burning sensation on my wrist cooled down. 

Breathing out a sigh, I managed to pull myself out of my head and got off the elevator before I ended up on the wrong floor. I slowly, sluggishly made my way to the machine that dispenses coffee, hot coffee. I really need that caffeine right now. reaching into my wallet I found enough quarters to pay for the coffee, I pressed for the mocha, and watched as the foam cup dropped down and the cup started to fill up with coffee the aroma alone could make me have a—ahem. My wrist burned as I glanced up to see the Devil leaning against the machine. 

“That smells divine,” he winked. 

“I feel like you’re stalking me.” I said reaching for my cup of coffee, but the devil took it straight out of my hand and took a sip of it. 

“Hardly,” he said. “I have far better things to entertain myself with. but you are my current new toy, so shiny and new.” 

“That makes me feel so much better.” I rolled my eyes, “look I’m sorry that chick got involved, it won’t happen again.” 

He stopped sipping, “pardon? Oh right, yes, the other fleshy human, I don’t mind if you bring companions, we all get a little lonely if you know what I mean—”

“Is there a point why you’re here and drinking my coffee?” I growled; I was not in the mood. I hadn’t slept for nearly seventeen hours, all I wanted was coffee and somewhere to take a nap. But obviously that’s too much to ask from the Devil himself. 

“I always have a reason to be somewhere,” he said with a matter-of-fact tone. “I worry about my new toy being broken, that is all.” 

“I’m breathing and able to move all my limbs, that’s good enough for you.” 

“Tone down the attitude, no wonder your mother was always nagging you,” he smirked hitting a sore spot. I glared up at the ceiling trying to count down from hundred and not swing at the Devil. As I said, I am not a violent person, but being around him pushes my urges to be that way. “I also wanted to let you know, there is another errand I need you to do in three hours from now. I need a violin, a certain twelve-year-old Asian girl wanted to be the best player in her class, fortunately for me I extended her payment until now. she either gives you her violin or you take her fingers. I don’t care, you pick, you’re the one getting it for me. yes?”

I gaped, “I am not cutting off a twelve-year-old girls’ fingers.” 

A patient walked past us and gave us a strange look and kept walking until they disappeared. “It’s not hard, bring a very sharp knife or clever, just in case you can’t get the violin back.” 

“What with the instruments?” 

He sipped my coffee again, “a lot of musician’s likes to contact me, I don’t know why, I think it has something to do with a jazz player that I helped out once on the crossroads,” he shrugged. “Any world, I will need an update on that errand once you are done.” he held the coffee out to me and turned down a hall. I leaned over and he was gone, looking down at my almost gone coffee, I wanted to cry, I felt defeated. 

Slowly I shuffled to the waiting room where Charlie was asleep on the couch. I fell into the nearby chair, and slowly found myself staring at the tv in the corner of the room. my eyelids became heavy, I tried to fight against the sleep, but my body demanded I get some sleep. slowly I closed my eyelids and felt myself fall into a deep sleep. I swear I heard Charlie mumbling about me needing to be careful, which is the first time I’ve heard him be nice to me, but I’m thinking I was just dreaming it. 

I wished had made a better wish than before, but we all have our regrets and a temporary stupidity moment, but as of right now I wish the Devil leave me alone to let me rest for a bit.

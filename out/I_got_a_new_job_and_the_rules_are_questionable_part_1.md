I was reading the newspaper and I saw an ad for a night security guard at a hospital for the morgue down there. It paid well so I called to apply. I got the head guard’s number so they could give me a few tips and other things. I got a text the next morning to see if I could work that night, and a list of rules. I told them I could work that night and then started reading the rules.

Your shift is from 10:30 to 5:00 if you get to the morgue between 10:45 and 11:00, don’t go in and check around.

If you ever need to go to the restroom or leave the level of the morgue, make sure the cameras facing the the doors to the morgue are on and recording. You can see on the room on the other side of the hallway with camera screens there. If they are on, you can leave, if not you’re gonna have to hold it.

If you ever come back to the morgue doors open, go into the camera room, shut the door, lock it, and try to push a file cabinet in front of the door. If not, I don’t think you will have to go the work tomorrow

You can stay in the camera room if you want just always have your eyes on the screens and make sure the door is shut. If you ever hear knocking, don’t open the door, same thing with the morgue doors if you stay outside

Around 2:30 you may hear screaming or running outside the camera room or in the morgue don’t go to inspect it.

If the screaming continues, stay in the camera room. It should stop around 3:00-3:15

Always either stay in the hallway or camera room, and if you want to go in the camera room, don’t stay in for over 2 minutes and if you hear a door open slam the door shut as fast as possible and try to get the file cabinet in front of it. If not the door will slam shut locking you in and you won’t be found the next morning.

Around the end of your shift(4:00-5:00) you can go back out to the hallway. Just be careful because if you see the morgue doors open, watch your back.

Sometimes there will be a pale person in the security guard uniform like yours. If they try to get near you, go to the camera room and don’t let them in.

This is the last and most important rule. The morgue is somewhere where you can never go your whole shift except from 10:30 to 11:00 and don’t try to inspect anything in the morgue after even if you hear someone or something in pain.

I thought I’d was a joke for the news guys so I laughed it off and went on with my normal day. I took a nap that afternoon for a bit more energy that night.

When I got there it was 10:25 and got to the morgue around 10:30. I went and checked the morgue out since I had 15 minutes to spare. When I got back out of the morgue it was 10:40 and I decided to go the camera room to check it out. I was looking at all the cameras to see where they were, and then I heard the door slam.

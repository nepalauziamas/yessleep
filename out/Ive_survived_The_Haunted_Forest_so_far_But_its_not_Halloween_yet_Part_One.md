I was the one that came up with the bad idea.  It had come to me as soon as Dina told me that her and her sister were going to The Haunted Forest and I should come along too.  She could tell from my expression that I was up to something, and was already looking nervous when I pulled it up on my phone and starting reading aloud from the website.

*Greetings, weary traveler.  Are you lost and looking for your home?  Perhaps you’ll find it along one of the winding paths of The Haunted Forest…*

*Before we tell you what The Haunted Forest is, we should tell you what it isn’t.*

*It isn’t a haunted house or field or trail or maze.*

*It isn’t a guided experience where you go from point A to point B, visiting silly set pieces where actors are paid to put on masks and jump out at passerby over and over and over again…*

*It isn’t for children, for anyone with health conditions or the inability to travel lengthy distances over uneven and even treacherous terrain, or anyone who is easily frightened or offended.*

*So what IS it then?*

*It is a one-of-a-kind experience.  The Haunted Forest has been created in a former privately-funded wildlife preserve.  Two hundred and thirteen acres of dense woodland cut through by several trails, dozens of paths, three creeks and…the screams of our victims.*

*After giving your information and payment, signing our waivers, and meeting a senior staff member’s approval for entry, you will be allowed inside The Haunted Forest.  There is no exit from the entry point, and the three available exit points are all located at different far edges of the Forest.  Barring an emergency, those are the only ways of getting out, so please consider your tolerances for this experience before signing up and requesting entry.*

*You may be thinking that this is a bluff or a clever bit of marketing.  We assure you that it is not.  As mentioned previously, The Haunted Forest was once a wildlife preserve, and one of its features is a ten-foot high fence topped with barbed-wire along its entire perimeter save for the entrance and three designated exits.  This was once designed to keep animals in and hunters out…but the rules are different here now.*

*You will be provided a map, a compass, and a flashlight, along with a small rucksack containing two bottles of water, two energy bars, and a pull-cord flare.  The flare is only to be used in a legitimate emergency, and while you will be instructed on its use during your pre-entry orientation, you are responsible for using it safely if and when the time comes.*

*This all sounds easy enough, you may be thinking.  You have a cell phone, after all.  You can always call or text if you need help.  Not so.  In order to heighten the experience and help our guests focus on their time in the Forest, we have implemented cell phone jamming technology throughout the Forest, and there are no wifi signals available within ten miles.  As for GPS, we use low-gain spoof transmissions to mimic information from a legitimate GPS satellite.  In non-nerd speak, your favorite map app will not know where you actually are any more than you do.*

*So what does all of this mean?  Are you just stumbling around in the dark until you find your way back out?  Well, no.  That would be your experience in a regular forest.*

*But this is The Haunted Forest.*

*In The Haunted Forest, even if you visit by yourself, you are never alone.  Along with the thirty-six travelers we admit every night, we also admit eighteen Hunters.  As is befitting the season, they will all be dressed in frightful costumes and they will be there primarily to scare you, but with several twists from a more conventional “haunt” experience.*

*First, they are free to roam the Forest as they please, and it is rare they will stay in one place for very long.*

*Second, Hunters cannot work together to outnumber you.  If you are solo or in a pair, only one Hunter can haunt you at a time.  If you have three, there can be two hunters, and so on.  No groups above six will be permitted entry.*

*Third, per the agreements and waivers you will sign prior to entry, the Hunters can and will touch you.  Before you react too strongly, just look at it as signing up for a public football or hockey game.  Our Forest is a contact sport.*

*Fourth, hidden among the eighteen Hunters there are four Harvesters.  If this Hunter catches you, he or she may tag you as Claimed Prey.  If you are tagged, you will be quickly removed from the Forest by staff and denied reentry.  This is true whether you’ve been inside for twenty minutes or three hours.  So it would be wise to be wary of any Hunter that crosses your path.*

*Fifth and finally, you need to remember that all is not what it seems.  Entering The Haunted Forest is not for most people.  But if you do, be warned.*

*You may never leave.*

“Holy shit!  That sounds fucking badass!”

Dina grinned.  “I know, right?  And it’s like two hundred bucks per, but with my birthday money I figured I can cover it if you and Lou Ann can cover gas and food.”

My eyes widened.  “No, I can help pay for it too.  Especially since I have an idea you’re going to hate.”

She let out a groan and rolled her eyes.  “No, Colin.  No!  No weird, dumb shit.”

I was already shaking my head.  “No, it’s going to be cool.  Just to spice it up a bit.”

Dina scowled at me, stabbing her finger at my phone.  “*This* is already cool.  It’s already spicy or whatever.  Let’s…just go and have a good time.  If you do some prank or freak out for your stupid internet channel and get us thrown out…”

“I won’t!  It’s nothing bad.  And hey, that stupid channel pays like half my rent.  And if I *do* make a video about it and post it, I promise to split the money with you guys.  We’ll turn a profit on the trip!”

She sighed.  “I already regret inviting you, fucker.”

Laughing, I poked her in the shoulder.  “Mean.  Tell you what.  Let’s ask Lou, and if she’s not down for it, I’ll drop it.”

“Ugh.  You say that because you know she’ll say yes to whatever you want.”

I shrugged.  “I can’t help if I’m charming and naturally trustworthy.”

“You’re a giant pain in my ass is what you are.”  Sighing, she gave a shrug.  “Fine, what’s your horrible idea?”

“We sign up and pay like normal.  Get inside like normal, walk into the woods a little bit, and then put on masks we’ve secretly brought with us.”

She raised an eyebrow at me.  “Why?  So it’s even harder to see?  It’ll already be dark as shit.”

I frowned.  “No, silly.  So we can jump out and scare people.  So we can be Hunters too.”


**** 

Lou was immediately onboard, and while it took some more badgering, we finally got Dina to agree to it as well.  We signed up the next day, and a week later we were heading out to the Forest.  It really was out in the middle of nowhere.  The nearest town was thirty miles away, and I’d never even really heard of this part of the state beyond its existence on maps.  Still, we were all excited, not just for The Haunted Forest itself, but our own game within a game.  She wouldn’t admit it, but I could tell by the flush in Dina’s cheeks and the gleam in her eyes when she grinned at me that she was as pumped as I was.

That was two hours ago.

As I record this, I’m somewhere in the northwest portion of the Forest.  I’ve dropped my phone twice—my hands are slippery with sweat and blood, but I also keep shaking so hard that

I had to stop for a couple of minutes.  Someone was walking by and I wasn’t sure if it was a guest or a Hunter.  I just need to finish telling what has happened up to this point in case I don’t get a chance to later.  Then I can try to find Dina and Lou again.  Try to get us out before it’s too late.

This was all such a fucking mistake.  It’s my fault.  Because now I know, and maybe they *know* I know.  They were telling the truth about the cell signals and GPS, so maybe they have cameras all over too.  They said they don’t, but how can you trust anything they say when they…Oh God.

No.  I can’t lose my shit now.  Not until I find Dina and her sister.  They don’t know what this place is yet.  They haven’t seen what I’ve seen.

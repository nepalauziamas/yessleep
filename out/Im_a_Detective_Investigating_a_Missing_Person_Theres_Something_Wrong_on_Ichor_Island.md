“Watch your step,” the ferry captain told me, opening the gate.  “It’s a long way down and the water's cold.”

The sea had been choppy on the way across from the mainland, the sky grey and foreboding of rain.  Captain Flanders and I had talked the whole time inside the warmth of his cabin as I attempted to soothe my nerves with conversation.  And to distract myself from what was right outside the windows all around us.  

Don’t look outside.  Don’t look at the water.  Pretend you’re at home in the city, on dry land.  

It had partially worked.  I hadn’t thrown up, and that was an improvement from my last time at sea.

My legs were wobbly as I stepped across the gap, trying not to look down.  Despite the pier being totally still I felt my body swaying up and down with the phantom sway of the ocean waves we’d experienced during our two hour journey on the small boat.  

I was safely on the island now.  That pit in the bottom of my stomach should have been going away, but it wasn't.

Why did I still feel so uneasy?

Seagulls laughed and swooped through the air nearby on a rock-strewn beach littered with bottles and old newspapers.  A thunderhead in the distance crackled to life with electricity, flashing white momentarily.  

“Thanks,” I said, careful as I made my way across the slippery wooden boards.  My feet wanted to skid and slide with each step forward, and I braced myself with one hand, grabbing onto the thick rope which served as a railing.  

It looked as if I was the only one visiting the island, I realized as the captain closed the gate behind me and went back into his cabin.  The vessel was small and I hadn’t seen anyone else aboard.  Still, I was surprised to confirm that I was the only passenger.  

“Over here!  Detective!” 

A man was calling to me from the gravel parking lot nearby and I walked towards him.  He was slender with glasses and a mustache, carrying a coffee cup in one hand and a donut in the other.  The policeman was wearing a worn, salt-stained blue rain slicker, more befitting a sailor than a man of the law.  Rain began to patter on us from above as he met me halfway, popping the donut into his mouth and taking my bag with his free hand.  

“Welcome to Ichor Island,” he said, his mouth chewing the donut and making it disappear in one large swallow.  “We spoke on the phone.  I’m Chief Varnson, but you can call me Bill.”

“Nice to meet you, Bill.  I wasn’t expecting you to meet me out here but I appreciate it.  Can you point me in the direction of a motel?  Or a bed and breakfast?  I don’t need much, just somewhere to lay my head overnight.”

Our voices were being drowned out by the increasing noise of the rainstorm and I had to speak loudly to be heard.

“Nothing like that around here,” he said, opening the passenger door of his car to let me in.  “But you can stay with me if you like.  My wife passed away a few years back and I wouldn’t mind the company.  How long did you plan on being here?”

“As long as I have to.  I’ll take you up on the bed offer - and I'll pay for your hospitality.  I’m not one to freeload.  Besides, my client is paying for my room and board.”

We both got in and he started the engine.  Rain dripped off of us and he turned on the heat and the wiper blades as it began to fall even harder - a staccato beat like pounding drums on the roof of the car as we drove towards town.    

“Who is your client, anyways?  I wasn’t clear on that when we spoke on the phone.”

“I’m not at liberty to discuss that, unfortunately.  But I do appreciate your help, Chief Varnson.”

"Bill."

"Right.  Thanks again, Bill."

As he turned down a gravel road I saw something in the trees, retreating suddenly as we approached - a large, hulking shape like a bear, but not quite.  

“Lots of wildlife on the island?” I asked, suddenly nervous.  “I think I just saw something.  Coulda been a bear, I’m not sure.”

“No bears around here.  Closest thing we’ve got is deer - brought over from the mainland at some point by hunters so they had something to do, but the damn things are outta control nowadays.  They probably outnumber the people ten to one.  Not that that’s saying much…”

We drove past a lot of abandoned houses on the outskirts of town, many of them half-collapsed, their roofs caving in.  But as we got further along I saw houses with cars outside and their lights on, so it wasn’t a complete ghost town.  

“Why did so many people pack up and move away?” I asked.  

“There’s not many jobs left on Ichor Island since the cannery closed…  Fishing isn’t what it used to be.  Every year I look around and there’s a few less familiar faces.  No sense stickin’ around if there’s no jobs.”

He drove through downtown and we finished the journey in awkward silence.  

“This is it,” Bill said as we arrived outside an old two storey building with a porch out front.  

A battered sign with faded blue letters swayed in the wind on rusty chains from the eaves and I barely made out the words: Police Station

He showed me the ramshackle bullpen with its single small jail cell, leading me up a set of creaking wooden stairs at the rear of the main level.  There was a small guest room on the second floor with an uncomfortable bed and dusty sheets where I could lay my head for the night.  The only amenity was a hard wooden chair which I sat on for a while, looking out the window at the falling droplets glowing in the street lamps’ light.  The town was quiet aside from the sound of the pounding rain and rumbling thunder in the distance.   

I didn't see anyone walking the streets until the following morning.  

By then the sun was out shining and my mood had grown considerably warmer with the weather.  Still, I'd be happy to get this case over with and get home, I thought to myself.  This little town was rubbing me the wrong way - people were polite but somehow cold at the same time.  

A cheerful voice called out, “Good morning,” to me and I looked to see someone approaching me on the street.  I was standing out on the veranda, enjoying the fresh air after a long night of allergies and unwashed bed linen.  
  
“You must be the detective,” a woman in a flowery yellow dress said, smiling blankly and pushing her baby down the road in a stroller.  “I’m Cindy Fox and this is little Susie.  We were just out for a stroll and I thought we’d pop by to say hello!”

I was slightly stunned at the interaction.  Everything about it just felt odd.  The woman’s smile was too broad, showing too many teeth.  Even her baby didn’t look right.  Her eyes were too intelligent and seemed to study me.  Then the baby began to grin as well - a fixed, toothy display of teeth.  But babies aren’t supposed to have teeth, are they?

“Nice to meet you,” I managed to say, my throat dry and tight.  “Susie and Cindy.  Very pretty names.  Can I ask, how did you know I was a detective?  And I should mention, I’m a private detective now - I’m not with the police force anymore.”

“Oh, we know.  It’s a small community here on the island, Detective.  Word gets around very quickly.  Nothing is kept secret for long.”

She smiled and walked off without another word, leaving me with that growing sense of unease again.  What was it about this place?  Was there something in the drinking water making everyone act so strange?  No wonder my client had hired me to look into the suspicious circumstances surrounding the disappearance of…

“Getting settled alright?” a voice asked from behind me, interrupting my thoughts.  It was Bill, the police chief.  He walked right past me, out onto the gravel road, yawning and stretching as if the main street were his living room.  

“Yeah, so far so good,” I said.  “Can you point me towards the general store?  I need to get something to eat.”

“They’ll be closed today.  It’s monday.  On the island just about everything is closed on Sundays and Mondays.”

“Damn, I didn’t bring much with me.  Is there any other place nearby where I can get something to tide me over until tomorrow?”

“Head up to the marina,” Bill said, pointing down the street.  “It’s right near where I picked you up last night.  Closest thing to a corner store we’ve got around here.  If you keep going past the docks you’ll see it.  Did you want a lift?”

“Nah, I’m good.  I could use the exercise.  Thanks for the offer, though.”

“Alright, suit yourself.  Enjoy your walk, Detective.”

I started heading off and he called after me, telling me to wait.  

“Y’know, if you told me what you were here investigating it would make it a lot easier for me to help you.  I’m just saying, that's all.  I know you got your deal with your client, but between two men of the law I think it should be alright to bend the rules a little bit, don’t you?”

He had been persistent on the phone as well.  The chief liked to know what was happening in his own backyard, and I couldn’t blame him.  

“I’ll give it some thought,” I said, trying to be diplomatic.  “You might have a point.”

“Fair enough,” he allowed, and I kept going on my way, my stomach rumbling with emptiness. 

I got about twenty paces down the road before I saw another face.  A man was trimming his bushes near the street, using a giant, oversized pair of hedge clippers.  His smile was similarly wide and welcoming, just like the chief, just like the woman with the baby stroller, and the baby.  

“Good morning, Detective!  Fine day for a walk!” 

The man continued snipping the greenery with his enormous shears as I approached, but his eyes were fixed on me.  By the time I got near to him, he was only trimming the air, missing the plant entirely.  

“Hello,” I replied, my anxiousness increasing again.  “It seems as if everyone in town knows about me.”

I tried to say this in as friendly of a tone as I could, but it was becoming difficult to maintain my composure.  

“Well, it’s a small place, Ichor Island.  Word gets around quickly.  I’m David O’Brien, the town gardener.  I keep all the hedges trimmed around here.  Mow the grass, plant the flowers, all that dirty business.  HAHA!  I tend to the cemetery as well, don’t you know?”

His voice was heavily accented and it was difficult to understand the man.  He seemed to be trying to hold in laughter, as if some joke were very funny but I wasn’t privy to it.  

After his introduction he turned on his heel and wandered off to another part of the property, giggling, his hedge clippers dragging in the grass behind him, digging up the immaculately maintained sod with reckless abandon.  

The interaction left me feeling disturbed.  Even more than I already was - and that was saying a lot.  

I was beginning to consider shortening my stay on Ichor Island.  Perhaps leaving tonight to come back with official reinforcements would be the safest bet.  Any longer than that and I might find out where my client’s sister had ended up much more intimately than I would like.  

Continuing on my walk, I passed several more residents.  They were mowing the grass, sitting on their porches sipping coffee, and walking down the street with dogs on leashes.  

Each time the same thing happened.  

“Good morning, Detective,” cheered a man fetching his mail, that same vacant look in his eyes and with the same wide toothy grin that was growing so familiar.  He produced a knife from his pocket and I jumped backwards, but then I saw he was just using it to open his mail.  He did so smiling, his eyes never leaving me.  

I hurried away, moving briskly down the street again, my head turning on a swivel.    

“Good morning, Detective,” laughed an elderly man on his porch, whittling something that resembled a pagan idol while resting on a rocking chair in the shade.  “Fine day for a walk!” 

“Good morning, Detective,” a woman walking her poodle said, startling me as she appeared from nowhere on the other side of me.  I jumped back and spiked my spine against the top of a picket fence, crying out in pain.  

She tilted her head and went past, grinning and laughing as if my injury were the funniest thing in the world.  

Even the DOG was smiling at me!  

Was I losing my mind?

I picked up my pace, trying not to look alarmed.  It felt as if I was surrounded by bloodthirsty animals rather than well-wishing pedestrians.  

There was a forested area on either side of the road up ahead and I rushed towards it.  But then I couldn’t help myself.  I stopped and turned around, looking back at the town square.  

Everyone on the street was stock still and glaring at me when I turned around, the smiles gone from their faces, replaced by blank stares. 

Shuddering, I looked away instinctively.  

It felt like I was in an episode of the Twilight Zone.

I began to speed walk again, hurrying through the forested area towards the marina up ahead.  It wasn’t far, and yet I was feeling more terrified than I had ever been in my life.  Suddenly I remembered the “bear” I had seen in the woods the day before.  Bill said it couldn’t have been, but it sure looked big, whatever it was.  

Darting my gaze to either side, I looked into the shadows of the trees trying to see if anything was pursuing me.  To my dismay, there was.  

A dark form was moving from tree to tree, blending in with the shadows and just barely visible.  It was moving in the same direction I was, but on a diagonal, its trajectory headed to cut me off up ahead.  

I hurried even faster, running down the gravel road as fast as my legs would take me.  

The thing moved quickly despite its size, but not as fast as me.  After a while I managed to gain a lead on it by sprinting, and I was soon out of the forested area completely.  

I went over to the building with a large sign out front reading: Marina - Gas and Snacks

The bell above the door tinkled as I entered, huffing and puffing, feeling out of breath from my short run.  So terrified I’d forgotten to breathe for a few moments. 

“Can I help ya?” a man wearing a green trucker hat asked from behind the counter.  

I took him in, trying to decide if he was alright.  He was the first person who didn’t greet me with a smile, knowing exactly who I was before I even opened my mouth.  

For some reason, I took that as a good sign.  Maybe he wasn’t one of THEM.  Whoever THEY were…

Still, I didn’t dare risk telling him what I’d just seen.  

I tried to calm myself and just act as if everything was normal.  I tried to fool myself a little bit even, telling myself that maybe it actually was.  Maybe I had been seeing things out there.  

“Just looking for something to eat,” I said, scanning the half-bare shelves.  

“Not much to go around today.  We get new stock on Tuesday,” he replied, pointing to some off-brand chips and soda.  There was also a rack with expired bags of pretzels and an assortment of gum.  

Nothing with any protein or real sustenance.  I would have settled for beef jerky, but they didn’t even have that.  It would be a long day at this rate, I thought, my stomach gurgling loudly again.  

I put a few items on the counter and gave the man his money, not feeling the least bit satisfied with my purchases of sodium and empty calories.  

There was a sign over the man’s shoulder which said they sold tickets for the ferry.

“What time does the boat leave today?” I asked, thinking I would make a break for it while it was still possible to do so.  

“It doesn’t.  No ferry on Mondays.”

“Oh.”  My heart began to hammer faster.  Another twenty four hours on Ichor Island.  That didn’t sit well with me at all.  

“Can I buy a ticket for tomorrow?”

“Sure you can.  That’ll be fifteen bucks,” he said, printing off a receipt.  

He handed it to me and put my items in a bag.  I turned around and started walking out of the little building when he called after me.  

“Sorry to hear you’re leaving so soon, Detective.  We do hope you’ll visit us again.”

My blood ran cold as I opened the door and walked out, not looking back.  I didn’t have to see him to know he was smiling widely as I left.  I could hear it in his voice.

I pulled out my cell phone and saw an Out of Service message displayed across the top, just like it had said the night before.  

Knowing I had to get a message back to one of my colleagues about this place before it was too late, I started hurrying back towards the police station.  

The shadow thing in the forest pursued me again on my walk back into town, this time choosing to remain at a distance.  I only hoped it stayed that way.  

Make yourself look big.  Speak in a low, loud voice.  And never, ever run.  I remembered hearing those things about Grizzly Bears.  Maybe they would translate to this situation as well.  

Don’t let them know you’re scared.  Pretend you’re more powerful than you are.  

Get a message back home and get some backup out here, pronto.  The idea was clear in my mind as I speed-walked out of the forest, down the street towards the police station, trying not to make eye contact with the smiling faces who walked past, greeting me.  

By the time I got back to the police station I was out of breath and exhausted, shaking as I closed the door behind me.  

Bill was nowhere to be seen.  

I went straight over to the phone on his desk and picked up the line to find it was dead.

All the connections looked fine so I went upstairs to my little bedroom, thinking maybe I could get some cell signal from up there.  I needed to get a call out to the mainland somehow.  

But of course the phone didn’t work.  

My stomach rumbled and gurgled again and I looked at the bag of pretzels I had purchased, thinking it wouldn’t be wise to eat them.  It would be better to starve than to risk eating anything from this place.  

Still, the longer I sat there staring at the bag, the more I began to think I was being foolish.  It was a sealed bag of pretzels - there was no way anybody tampered with it.  

I opened the bag and began to munch on the salty snacks.  Of course I got thirsty and opened the soda I had purchased as well, hearing the hiss of carbonation and the click of the seal and taking that as a good sign for my safety.  

Although I didn’t recognize either brand name of the pretzels or the soda, they tasted pretty good.  Just faintly strange.  

After eating and drinking for a while, I sat looking out the bedroom window, sitting up in the chair, trying to decide my next move.  

My eyelids began growing heavy as I saw people converging outside the police station, wearing brown hooded robes and carrying torches, pitchforks, and pikes.  

I tried to stand up but couldn’t.  My legs were numb and my arms weighed a thousand pounds as they hung limply at my sides.  

Distantly I heard someone open the door to the bedroom as I began to fade in and out of consciousness.  

Looking up at the people in the doorway, I saw Bill was standing there staring at me.

“The pretzels,” I mumbled, slumping from the chair onto the floor in a heap.  "Poison…"  

He began putting zip ties around my wrists and cinching them together tightly.  

“Sorry, Detective,” he said, looking down at me.  "It’s so hard to get sacrifices for Belisama these days.  No tourists come to Ichor Island anymore.  We had to start getting creative…”

"Belisama?..." The word was strange and unfamiliar.  I tried to think what it could mean but my mind felt like it was full of quicksand.

“Come on, let’s go to the ceremony.  It’s just about to begin.  But it can’t start without you.”

I passed out after hearing those words, and dreamt of drowning in brackish waters, screaming and taking in saltwater instead of air as the undertow dragged me deeper.  

*

When I woke up I was hanging from a rope, tied upside down to a pole.  The water was beneath my face and it was only a few inches away.  

The residents of the town were on the beach, wearing robes and chanting as the waves lapped at their bare feet.  

Chief Varnson was at the center of them all, looking out at me and holding an open book in his hands.  The ancient tome looked weather worn and salt stained from decades or perhaps centuries of use.  Beside him stood a gigantic man, at least eight feet tall, wearing a hat made from a bear’s head.  

The thing which had been pursuing me in the forest had been a man, after all.  But he hadn’t been necessary - I’d done their work for them by eating the tainted food.  

“You, Detective, will serve as a sacrifice to Belisama, Goddess of the seas, the one who blesses all fishermen with good yields.  As the tide comes in it will plunge your head beneath the cleansing salt water and the goddess herself will come to visit you as you take your last breaths.  Be thankful, for you should be honored to see her visage."

I screamed as the waves began to tickle my forehead.  Then the sea started to submerge my face completely with occasional whitecaps as the tide came in and the water rose higher and higher.  

Gulping in a bellyful of saltwater, I felt terrified and sick.  The liquid went up my nose and I felt panic rising up inside of me as I struggled to reach the surface but couldn’t.  

I was completely submerged, thrashing while I was dangling upside down in the surging waves.  

The ocean water was cold but clear, revealing the reef below with schools of fish and kelp that danced in front of me and tickled my face.  

As I started losing consciousness, I saw something else as well.  

A beautiful woman swimming towards me.  I thought for a moment perhaps she was coming to save me.  

But then she opened her yawning mouth to reveal her teeth - long and sharp enough to rip the flesh from my bones.  Curved and serrated like piranha.

Belisama.  

Her skin looked blue in the water, her smile growing wider as she swam closer to me.  I squirmed and bucked against the ropes holding me.  But it was no use.  I cringed as she got close enough to scrape her fingernails against my cheek. 

But then suddenly I felt myself being lifted upwards by the rope around my ankles.  My head emerged from the water to see a blessed sight.  

Captain Flanders, the ferry captain who’d brought me over to the island, was pulling me up onto the deck of a small fishing boat.  Meanwhile on the shoreline, the residents of Ichor Island were screaming and throwing things in our direction.  Several of them were even wading out into the water in their cultish robes, looking ready to climb aboard the vessel.  

Those unfortunate souls ended up filling in as sacrifices to Belisama, as she didn’t differentiate between her worshipers and the tourists.  All she saw was meat.  

And the goddess was hungry.  

The water turned red with their blood and I saw limbs flying through the air and their terrified faces screaming and gurgling in the saltwater.  

But then the boat began to move and those horrible sights and sounds faded into the distance.  Pretty soon all I could hear was the roar of the engine, and I closed my eyes, trying to forget the nightmare of Ichor Island.   

I wish I had better news for my client, but I’m going to have to pass this case on to higher authorities.  This mystery is beyond my pay grade.  

And either way, I’m pretty sure I know what happened to her sister.  

Belisama is always hungry.  And she has a taste for tourists [now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/JGcreepypastas/comments/raq7ay/all_stories_20212022/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

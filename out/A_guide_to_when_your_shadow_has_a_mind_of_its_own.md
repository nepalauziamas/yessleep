I don't know who this will reach, but I wanted to make this guide for anyone like me, whose shadow is *not* normal. This is also to warn anyone who could be a potential victim of this phenomenon.

I would like to share my personal experience first.

It started when I was very young, younger than most people are when it appears. I must've been about 5 years old. My shadow never disappeared, never, even in the darkest of rooms. There was always an outline, faint as it may have been. This is the first sign, but it is also the most unnoticeable. It's only when I think back that I even realise it was there. For anyone reading this now, feel free to turn your light off and check yourself. The earlier that you realise this, the better.

The second sign arose when I was 10. I remember this distinctly. This is when my shadow started to lag behind me, or sometimes run in front of me, and not in the typical way it should. There were times that my shadow could be literal feet away, until it eventually came back to me once people showed up. If this is where you notice it (much like me), then you might be lucky enough to stop it before it's too late.

The final step is when it *does* disappear, and this is where action must be taken. If this is when you become aware of it, then you have already failed, and I am sorry.

The final step happened when I was 14. I was lying in bed at the time, very late at night. I hadn't noticed that my shadow was gone due to the dark of my room. I couldn't sleep that night. The feeling of dread was overwhelming, but I couldn't place why I felt that way. I had gotten up to take a walk and try to calm down, but the eerie silence of my house just made me uncomfortable, so I went back to bed.

It was later, at 4am, that it happened.

My door had creaked open, leading me to turn around in my bed, and there it was, barely visible through the illumination of the hallway light. It was dragging my mother's body into the middle of my room, but I couldn't see her. I could just hear the blood sliding across the hardwood. It propped her up on my reading chair and then slinked back out into the hallway, returned with my father and propped him on my bed.

I was frozen in shock. It hadn't registered yet. I thought it had been an intruder, and when it hid under my bed, that only made me more afraid.

I must've sat there for hours; daylight had already broken by the time I ran. Little was I aware that the murderer was only feet behind me, blended into the walls.

I phoned the police and told them everything, but they found no intruder, no evidence, no sign of break in, nothing. The details of my parents murder were a complete mystery, beyond the various injuries that littered their bodies. I went to live with my grandmother, but I didn't really know her much, we had only visited her once every few years.

I started investigating on invisible murderers, searching various things online, but got no results or answers; Until one day I asked google "Why does my shadow walk so far away from me" purely out of curiosity and boredom.

This led me to a website of people with similar experiences, people who had reported their shadows disappearing, people who had lost their families in mysterious circumstances, people who were just like me. I spent years talking to these people, years collecting information, years learning how it all worked.

The website got taken down, which is why I'm making this post, to try and keep this information on the internet somehow.

THE GUIDE OF WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR SHADOW HAS A MIND OF IT'S OWN:

First you must truly understand what causes this, and what it is. It's a debated subject, or atleast it was back on the old website. Many say that their shadow started acting up after extreme trauma, but I know I had no trauma when the phenomenon started. This is why I believe that everyone can be vulnerable to it, but if you've experienced trauma recently, I implore you to check just in case.

A common theory was that it targets sensitive souls, which is *why* people with trauma are so susceptible. It also explains why it targeted me, a young child. If you consider yourself sensitive, then please check.

The last major theory was that it targets the cruel, those with disgusting tendencies and that the shadow only helps to make these tendencies more prominent. I do not believe in this theory as much.

There were many others that I will not put here, but if you are suffering from this issue, but do not relate to any of the above theories, then please message me your story and I'll try to help as much as I can.

Sadly not much is known of the phenomenon, only theories and patterns, I can only help so much.

I would now like to go into the signs of the phenomenon appearing.

Sign one:

Your shadow never disappears, even in pitch black. This can start at any age, but it's typical in teenagers and young adults. The shadow may be incredibly faint, but you must check thoroughly, if you find it at this stage, then you may have time to prepare yourself. This stage may last years, anywhere up until a decade.

Sign two:

Your shadow starts to move on it's own, whether that be feet infront of you or feet behind you. It will always return to you when people are around to see, but will otherwise be fairly far away. This is when you must notice it, or else. It can last anywhere from a few months to a year.

Sign three:

It disappears, when this happens, you only have so much time before it either takes or kills your loved ones. You have to either find it, or stay close to your loved ones until it comes back - I was lucky that I wasn't close to my grandma, or else she'd surely be dead - The shadow will not kill or take while you are around to see it, so you must keep it (or your loved ones) in sight until it returns to normal.

It will do this many times throughout your life, sometimes even when you are asleep, which is why I recommend setting frequent alarms. A feeling of incoming doom is common. 

It is not afraid to display your deceased loved ones, please prepare yourself for potential trauma.

I wish I could tell you more, warn you more, let you know exactly what it can and will do, but I cant, I hardly understand it myself.

I don't know what it is, I don't know what causes it, I don't know if you can stop it, I can only speculate and tell you what I know.

All I ask is that you check yourself and your loved ones, and prepare for the worst if you notice it's presence. Please reach out if you want to know more, and I'll do my best.

This post might not even be seen, it might not even be readable, but I'm trying my best to make this *thing* more known so no one else has to die like my parents did, and no one else has to experience the fear and pain that I did.

I wish you all well.

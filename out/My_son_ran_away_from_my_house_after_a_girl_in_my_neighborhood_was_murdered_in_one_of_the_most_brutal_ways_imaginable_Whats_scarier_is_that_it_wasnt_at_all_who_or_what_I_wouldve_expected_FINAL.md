The ride to the station felt like a blur. Every second of the way, I was honestly expecting for the officer's radio to go off. Would they find him? Would he be alive (and/or even in one fucking piece)? *Would he be found in the dumpster, like Teresa was?*

That was it. The dam burst and tears started raining down my cheeks. I couldn't think straight. At all.

We finally stopped, after what felt like an hour, even if it was really only a couple minutes. He got out and started walking into the station. I stayed seated, lingering, my mind stuck in a typhoon of emotions as well as the vain hope that the radio was gonna buzz and the other officer would come on, saying something like *"We found him. Got the little rug rat right here, yes sir. Turns out, he was just hidin' out in the woods."* or some shit like that. Anything, so long as it meant he was safe and at home again.

It didn't. I was broken from my trance when the officer tapped on my window, signaling me to come on out and follow him in the station. I did, slumping out of the car and in the building. My head felt hollow as I did. Inside, he led me to one of the interrogation rooms and told me to wait for a moment while he went to get something I walked in and sat down.

Like on the road, time passed really slow then, too. The officer returned not long after, though again, I felt so out of it that he may as well have spent the better part of the night wherever he was. He sat down across from me with a manila folder in his hand.

"You okay, Mr.  Warren?" he asked. The tone of voice he used made it clear he knew damn well already I wasn't, not even remotely. "Sorry," he said, chuckling dryly, "Stupid question, I know. Just trying to ease you up a bit, you know?" I didn't answer.

He opened the folder and began pulling out photos. Looking at them, were I not already caught in an emotional typhoon, I likely would've thrown up right where I was. The photos were of dismembered body parts, varying from severed arms, legs, a few fingers and toes, eyeballs, and one or two even of severed *genitalia!*

"What the--" I exclaimed, "What the hell are these?"

"Body parts." he replied. "Specifically, murdered victim's body parts."

"Yeah, I see that. But why are you showing these to me? What does this have to do with my son?" He sifted through and pulled out a photo of a young girl with a shot, brunette bowl-cut.

"Mr. Warren, meet Gertrude Walsh. She was a good girl, got good grades, had lots of friends, and was the shining angel of the school and church fundraisers. Everybody loved her, see?" He laid the photo down and began picking up pictures of the body parts again. "Everybody, that is, except for the sicko that decided she would be much better off quartered and dumped into the lake just down the road from here for the fish to have at her."

I looked at the photos. I could see entire chinks of desiccated flesh missing from where it'd been eaten away. Already, wheels were turning in my head. Something about what I was told sounded familiar, hauntingly so. *Drawn and quartered, dumped?* Images of Teresa began coming back to me again.

The officer pulled out another set of photos. This one was a slightly older girl, this one maybe being in early to mid-20's. She had long, vibrant blonde hair, at least, that's what I figured it was SUPPOSED to look like originally. The photos showed off spots where it looked like it'd been forcefully ripped out. In those places were patches of exposed muscle tissue. And just like Gertrude and the others I saw before, this girl's face was also mutilated beyond recognition. Not one single inch of the girl's face, or the rest of the skin on her body, was without at least five or six slash marks, many of them looking like they might've actually cut through muscle and down to the *bone!* I thought for sure I was gonna be sick, seeing that.

"Now I want you to meet Jessica Reese." the officer said, "Like Gerdy, here, Jessica was also a good girl. Head of the cheerleading squad here at Willow wood high and was an avid contributor and/or advocate for some of the local charities. Always a giver, never asking for anything in return. Of course, I'm sure she would've given everything she owned if it would've meant being able to keep from ending up like this."

"Wh-Why?" I asked, choking back the urge to retch. He sat staring at me intently as he was before. "Why are you showing me this? What, you think *I* had something to do with this?" I knew that was a bit of a stupid question. He shook his head. "Then what are you saying here? What's the purpose for this?"

"Like I've told you three times now, I'm not accusing you of a damn thing. I didn't bring you here under any kind of suspicion. Rather, I wanted to see if you could pick up on something by looking at these photos."

I looked at him confused. "What do you mean?"

"You know what I'm talking about, here, Mr. Warren. These girls, they look familiar, don't they. All of the pictures have a few things in common, don't they?" I nodded my head. Whether out of denial or sheer disgust, I didn't want to admit knowing exactly where he was going with this. That these were all  pictures of young girls, pretty and kind and basically sunshine children from the neighborhood, just like Teresa Kaufman, all who'd been viscously slaughtered and chopped to bits before being dumped somewhere.

"Uh huh, I can see it all over your face," he continued, narrowing his eyes at me, "You've seen something like this before, haven't you?" Again, I just nodded.

"W-When did these happen?" I asked.

He pointed to the one of Gertrude and replied, "She was found September 26th, 2017." Pointing to Jessica, he said, "September 27th, 2018."

"And the same person did both? were there any suspects?"

He sighed, "Well, that's just it. To put it bluntly, no, we never had any actual suspects. The only one who *MIGHT'VE* fit that bill was an old curmudgeon that lived in the house at the very end of Willow Ln."

"Did he say anything, maybe confess?"

"Nope. And he was killed just a year or so after Jessica, here. Some of the folks in the neighborhood decided to play vigilante justice and ganged up to beat the poor bastard to death, holding him responsible for some other kids going missing as well."

"But then, what about Teresa?"

He sighed again. "Like I said, Mr. Warren, that's where this gets tricky. Thing is, outside of the M.O. of this freak apparently targeting young girls with ties to the community, we hadn't ever been able to really pin down any sort of objective or any real pattern. At least, not at first." He shuffled through a few more photos. Pulling two of them out, he slid them over to me.

They were both of severed arms, slashed all to hell like every other part of them. But this tome, there appeared to be an area on both of them that was accentuated. An area that wasn't just repeated gash marks streaking across the flesh. Engraved deep into both of them was what looked like an, albeit sloppily drawn, pentagram with the words *"Lucifuge Rolfecau"* written equally as sloppy in dried blood underneath it. The gashes obscured the words so much that they were almost illegible entirely, as well as the actual penmanship itself looking like that of a 1st grader.

"What is this?" I asked, shocked and horrified now beyond belief. "You're saying that this was a human sacrifice, like from a satanic cult or something?"

"Something like that." he replied. "Or at the very least, something made to look like one."

"What do you mean?"

"Well, that's just it. At least from our records, we'd never had any kind of run-ins with a satanic cult or anything of the sort. But for at least the past four years or more, up to now, with the Kaufman girl, we'd been finding bodies just like this, shredded to the point where the only thing telling us who they were were their teeth; and all of them, including the Kaufman girl, by the way, were all found with that mark carved in their arms."

"Yeah, and?" He pointed to the photos again.

"Well, for the longest time, the trail essentially went cold. Time passed with no leads, just an ever climbing body count. And it stayed like that for a good while, till we started noticing a few OTHER factors." I looked up at him, confused.

"What other factors?"

"I take it back, maybe I should say, other *inconsistencies*." I raised my eyebrows. I was completely lost.

"Huh?" I asked.

"Look at the photos again." he said, holding up one of the ones of Gertrude's shredded remains alongside a few of the others, like Jessica and even Teresa's.

"What about 'em?"

"You don't notice the differences?" I tried looking closer. "look at the words again. See how they aren't written the same?" I squinted my eyes and saw it, the difference. Across the arms, smeared across the innumerable cuts and gashes, were the words, but each time, written differently. Some of them were missing letters, while others were only half-formed letters. Each one looked written poorly, but they each had one or two unique things wrong with it.

"Y-Yeah, I see it." I replied. "But what does it mean, and what's it got to do with finding--"

"So it means we'd been looking in the wrong place." He interrupted. "We may not be looking for one killer, but a group. Like you said, though, there hadn't been any reported cult activity in this area. At least, not any that people would mention."

"What do you mean? You think the neighborhood's been trying to cover up for a satanic cult?"

"I'm saying the neighborhood might not *know* there's a satanic cult."

"How? Why wouldn't they know? I mean, surely *somebody* would've seen something, right? I mean, how would they be able to pull this off with multiple people without anyone ever saying something?"

"Good question." he answered, leaning back in his chair. He stared distantly at the wall behind me and said, "That's the part I'm still putting together, here. I mean, I have a working theory at best, but trust me, it's a long-shot, as well as one I hope to *God* isn't true."

"What, what is it?" He broke from the wall to stare at me momentarily, examining me, before returning to the wall.

"Like I said, Ol' Willow don't know about any kind of cult activity. Like you, I don't think it's part of a scandal, either. No, whoever these people are, they hide extremely well. Likely in plain sight. And what they do is done somewhere that's likely overlooked by most."

"Overlooked?"

"Yeah, somewhere the residents are familiar with. Somewhere where, if they were seen gathering, they'd probably just look at 'em and say "Huh, look at that, jimmy, a coupla dingbats hanging out", you know?" I nodded, though still not having any clue as to where the hell he was going with this. "Now, here's where you start to come in as far as any of this goes. I want you to think real hard, is there any place at all that you can think of that might serve that kind of purpose here in the neighborhood?"

I paused for a moment. I was about to tell him that I couldn't when I stopped, thinking again of the neighborhood. *A place people would likely pass right over...*

"Maybe a spot in the woods, somebody's backyard that you might see a bunch of people gathered behind, anything?" I remained silent.

"Well, yesterday, I found my son playing at the end of the neighborhood, in the old Blacktop with some of the other kids. I guess that'd be the best guess I've got as far as that goes." He furrowed his brows.

"The Blacktop, huh?"

"Yeah, they were playing around in it." His eyes narrowed at the wall.

"Uh huh," he said, obviously connecting dots in his head, dots that I still couldn't see. "You happen to *see* what they were playing?"

I thought back to seeing Kai and the others, all gathered in a circle around the little girl. "I think they were playing "Ring-around-the-rosie" or something. I don't know, it was weird."

"Weird how?" He was looking at me now, eyes fixed solidly on me.

"I don't know, just weird." I replied, not sure (or at least trying to not be sure) what was going on, thinking about the incident. "There was this little girl just laying there on the ground. The kids were gathered around her... holding hands..." A distinct chill started stabbing my back. The officer could tell I was starting to pick up on his lead as well, with the way his eyes started to widen in alarm.

"Laying on the ground?" he repeated.

"Y-Yeah..." I replied, shuddering. I started thinking then of how Kai acted when I came to take him back to the house. I started thinking about what he was saying. *The kid called it a "Ceremony"...*

"Was the girl alive?" asked the officer. I snapped back to attention, having lost myself on thought again.

"Huh?"

"The girl, was she alive? She look hurt in any way?"

"No. No, not that I could see, anyways." I started shaking in my chair. Now I was officially terrified about Kai. If this was heading where I, deep down, knew it was, then every second that passed without any kind of word on Kai would drive me further and further into a heart attack worrying about where he was.

"And you said your son was with them?" he asked, sounding like he knew what my reaction to this question was gonna be, and was bracing himself for it. To his credit, he wasn't wrong with his assumption, either. My eyes went wide and my lingering sense of dread was instantly replaced with alarm.

"Hold on, is *that* why you brought me down here? You're trying to get me to turn my own son in?" I could feel myself slipping into hysterics. "You're out of your fuckin' mind! My son is missing with some maniac out there, and you're here, harassing me with half-baked conspiracies, thinking he's going around sacrificing people to the devil, instead of actually trying to find him!"

He just sat, staring at me. He remained calm, despite clearly seeing that I was two seconds from jumping up and throwing my chair at him. I was sure he'd had conversations like this before, where someone started flying off the handle at him. I could tell, from the way his calm, yet chiseled stare bore straight through me, reminding me again that I needed to get myself in check -- and quick.

Another moment passed in silence before the officer spoke again. "You done?" he asked, sounding more annoyed than anything else. I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and relaxed again in my chair. "Good, Now if you'll stop for a second, I'd like to tell you, for the ump-teenth time already, that you're not here under suspicion. Your boy wasn't, either. But if you said he was with them this evening before he went missing, then that *could* be a clue as to where he is now and/or what happened, yes?"

I sighed. "Yeah... I guess you're right."

"And if what you've just told me is true, then it could also be a clue as to what's been happening to these girls. See, this whole time, right up until you told me what you did, I thought we were looking for  adults, maybe a couple of punk ass teenagers who think they're tough shit. But now, I think it's starting to make more sense."

I raised my eyebrow. "How?" He held up the photos of the severed arms again.

"See the words?" He pointed to the pentagram carving. "See how sloppy it's written?" My eyes somehow managed to widen further than they already were."

"Y-Yeah." I stammered, shaking.

"Like I'm sure you did, when myself and a few of the other detectives working these cases saw this, we didn't think much of it, other than, again, either a rushed job by a group of wack-o satanists, or a couple of punk teenagers. Now, I see that it would make as much sense if these were done by *kids.* That would explain how they're so sloppily written and why the pentagrams are drawn just as crappy, wouldn't it?"

I sat staring at him in shock, wide-eyed, white faced and slack-jawed. I couldn't believe it. These kids, kids I somewhat knew for years -- had let my son play with for years -- were a part of some demonic murder cult this entire time!

*And now my boy was out there, probably already taken by them!*

"H-How?" I stammered.

"What?" he asked.

"How're they doing this?" I held up one of the photos. "I mean, these are *kids* we're talking about, here. How in the hell are they doing *this?*"

"Well, that's just it. Like I said before, these kids obviously knew *something* of what they were doing. They obviously know how to hide, as well as how to avoid suspicion. My guess is they're using the Blacktop you mentioned as a sort of meeting ground, you know?"

"Yeah, but how are they doing the murders? They're just kids, how has no one caught them yet?"

"Well, You said you thought they were playin' "Ring-around-the-rosie", didn't you?" I nodded my head anxiously. "What if others would've thought something like that as well?" I raised my eyebrows. "What if their able to meet up, have their little witches sabbath or whatever, dump the body, and be back home before the streetlamps come on, with mommy and daddy never being the wiser?"

"How, though?" I asked, completely baffled at this point. "How could no one see this?"

"Obviously these kids know more than we thought they would, and obviously they're aware of the fact that the Blacktop is a pretty inconspicuous location. Not to mention, as you're making pretty clear, here, nobody suspects little kids for this sort of thing. Now couple this with the fact that there's already not much in the way of traffic coming in or overall activity with the residents in Willow Ln., and yeah, it might not be as hard to imagine as you think."

I was speechless. My heart raced dangerously fast. My mind was a typhoon of anxiety and sheer horror. I couldn't believe it. Yet, I couldn't refute it, either. The more I thought about it, the more I started to see the dots connect. Finally, I managed to stammer out, "Wh-What're you gonna do?"

His lips stiffened. He was stumped. "That's just it," he said, "Right now, there's nothing we really *can* do. Other than what you've just told me, we still don't have any concrete proof that that really is what's going on, here. Plus, even if we did, we still don't know who any of them are--" I cut him off.

"Andrew Miller." I exclaimed. He raised his eyebrows in confusion. "At the Blacktop, Andrew Miller was one of the boys with my son."

"You mean Rick's boy?" the officer asked. He sounded truly skeptical this time, for the *first* time.

"Yeah, he sometimes came around to play with Kai in the front yard. It was him and a few other boys with my son, dancing around the girl on the Blacktop."

"You recognize any of the others there?" he asked. I shook my head. He went back to staring intently at the wall. Things were silent for another minute before he finally stood up and said, "Alright, Mr. Warren, you're free to go."

I sat still. "Wait, what about--"

"We're gonna keep an eye out for him. I'll keep a unit outside your house as well as keep one posted near the Blacktop to keep an eye out for anything suspicious there. In the meantime, just keep one ear to the ground and one eye to the sky for me, okay?" He pushed a card into my chest and said, "Anything look weird, anybody -- and I mean *ANYBODY* \-- you see looking like they're doing something they shouldn't be, you call me, got it?"

I nodded, slowly getting up from my chair. We left the interrogation room and he led me to the front door, where he escorted me to a patrol car that was waiting to drive me home. I got in and the officer behind the wheel began driving. Much like the drive TO the station, my mind was a complete blur, caught now between thoughts of the things I’d seen and heard, as well as the lingering question of where the hell my son was.

Now, though, there was an all new question stirring around; was Kai involved with any of this? Thinking once again back to the situation at the blacktop earlier, I couldn't fight the feeling that, had I not shown up when I did, he might’ve taken part in something horrible. One thing was certain, though; part of a cult or not, I wouldn’t be able to have a second of peace until he was found.

*Please, God, bring me my boy back!*

As it happened, I was taken back to my house without any kind of word on my son, or any of the other kids for that matter. And it would stay that way for the next week or two as well. I didn't get any kind of sleep, either, obviously. How could I?

Not only was my son now missing, but everything I'd come to know about where I was living had been turned on its head. Where before, I could've felt safe leaving my door unlocked all the time, now I couldn't feel safe even trying to open my door to go outside. At all. It got to a point, after about the 4th or 5th day of calling out "sick", that they told me I was in serious danger of losing my job if I didn't start coming back in. Even still, though, it's not like I was all that productive at work.

I'm sure most of my coworkers were getting sick and tired of me ignoring them the entire time I was there, with the exception being just to ask them if they'd happened to have seen Kai. And I'm pretty sure my boss was getting fed the fuck up with me spending most of my time trying to reach out through social media with it as well. But what the hell was I supposed to do, huh? What would *YOU* do in my position? If it was *YOUR* son or daughter (especially if it was your daughter in this circumstance) that was out there, god only knew where, with a group of murderous little kids running around, hacking people up in deranged human sacrifice rituals, would *YOU* be calm and just "go about your day as usual" like these ass wipes apparently expected me to, or would it be everything you could do to not just say "screw *everything"* and be on 24/7 patrol looking for them?

Well, in that vein, my wish was half granted. I wouldn't need to actually look for him myself at all. It was around that Friday night, about 9:30 or so, that I heard screaming coming from the neighbor's house. Already alert, like I mentioned before, I instantly jumped up and bolted to the window. Outside, the officer that'd been posted outside my house was approaching the neighbor's house, the same neighbor, sure enough, that I'd gone to the night Kai disappeared. I guess, in a really, *really* sick sort of way, it's only fitting what happened next, then.

I watched the officer draw his gun before signaling to his partner to go around to the back of the house. I saw the officer then proceed to kick the door in. My mind was an angry hornet's nest, everything happening all at once. Every anxious thought, feeling, or emotion whizzed through my head as I watched the officer enter the house.

*Oh God, what is it now? Why're they screaming, what's happening in there?* This then led to another horrifying thought. What if it's those kids? That little girl from the Blacktop, what if that was their daughter, and they were there, looking to finish what I'd interrupted? Then it hit me. What if Kai was with them?!

That was when my instincts kicked into full-on berserk mode and I bolted out of the front door of my house. I heard shouting coming from the from the porch from inside the house. I could hear the officer's shouting "Let her go, son!"

*Oh God, please don't let that be him!*

I ran inside. Huddled in the corner of the living room, quivering in fear, was my neighbor and his wife. In front of me was the officer, standing in the threshold between the living room and dining room areas, gun trained forward. "Put it down, kid!" he shouted. I scrambled forward and damn near dropped dead of a heart attack where I stood. In the middle of the dining room floor, sat Kai, Andrew Miller, and one of the other boys. Kai stared at the officer, petrified. In one hand, he held the little girl from before to the ground by her throat with a kitchen knife raised high in the other hand.

The other two boys were also staring at Kai, silently urging him to do it, to kill the girl, who was laying on her back, unconscious and bleeding badly from multiple stab wounds that I could see in her left side. I was frozen. This was the worst possible thing I could've ever witnessed. My worst fear, and there it was, sitting right in front of me, sitting in a pool of blood with a gun aimed at him. Kai exchanged rapid looks back and forth between the officer, the other boys, and the girl. I watched his knife hand start to shake, like he was hesitantly gonna bring it down.

"Kai!" I cried out. At once, Kai, the other boys and the officer all turned to look at me. Kai, who  I knew was already scared to death, somehow had even more color drain from his face when he saw me.

"Sir, I need you to back away, now!" shouted the officer. I remained where I was.

"D-Dad..." Kai whimpered. His hand stiffened in the air. I stepped forward, outstretching my hand.

"Sir, back away!" the officer barked again. I ignored him, taking another two steps toward the dining room.

"Son," I said, calmly, "Daddy's here. It's time to come on home now, okay?" I took another step. He flinched slightly, trying to move away from me. I heard the officer's gun click. "Wait!" I shouted, turning back to him.

"Sir, please, I don't wanna say it again. Move away, now!"

"I'm not gonna let you hurt my son!" I shouted back. I turned back to face Kai. "Come on, buddy. let's go back home, okay? Daddy's missed you. We can go home and everything can be okay again. We'll have hot dogs and curly fries, watch a movie together, just like we used to, remember?"

Kai's body began shaking. His big green eyes started to glisten. "I-I m-miss you, too Daddy." he choked out. "I miss you and Mama." Despite being stuck in a state of panic, I couldn't help but feel my heart snap in half in my chest.

"Do it, brother Kai!" Andrew Miller snapped from behind him. Kai swung his head to look at him. "You have to finish the ceremony so you can see your mother again!" My eyes widened.

"Son, what is he talking about?" He looked back to me.

"I-I have to do it, Dad. I have to give her as an offering so Mama can come back and be with us." I exchanged looks between him and the boys. They were serious, hellbent on killing this little girl just like they had the others and sacrificing her to the devil. Kai, I could see, though, didn't want to do this. He was scared, just wanting his mother back.

He looked back down at the girl. I couldn't her chest moving anymore. I was almost sure she was gone, having lost a lot of blood by that point. His arm shook again. "Kai, don't do this, please!"

"I have to, Dad. I want Mama back!" His voice broke when he said this. Tears started streaming down his face.

"I know, buddy, I miss Mama, too. But think about it, what would she say if she saw you right now? You think she'd want you to hurt this little girl?" He stopped again. I could see his grip on the knife start to loosen, beginning to dangle in his hand. I knew I had him.

"Come on, Monkey," I said calmly, taking another step towards him. He remained where he was, shaking. I reached my hand slowly toward the knife. "Let's put down then knife and go home, okay? Just you and me."

"Sir, what're you doing?" the officer asked. I quickly shot a glare behind me at him before looking back to Kai. Kai was now fully in tears.

"I want Mama!" he cried.

"I know, buddy. I know." My hand was only an inch away from being able to grab the knife. Slowly, I watched the his fingers uncurl from around the handle. "That's right, let go of the knife. Everything's gonna be okay no--"

Before I could finish, Andrew Miller snatched the knife out of Kai's hand. "I'll finish the ceremony then!" he shouted before thrusting the blade towards the girl. Kai snapped up.

"NO!" he screamed, thrusting himself in front of the knife. Quicker than I could even blink, Andrew had the blade embedded all the way to the hilt in my son's stomach. Pulling the knife back out, He and the other boy too off toward the back. The officer shouted into his radio that they were headed out the back while he came up to me and Kai.

"*KAI!"* I rushed over to catch him as his body fell. Blood started pouring like a waterfall from the gash just above his naval. He was gasping for air. "Kai! Kai!" I shouted, feebly trying to plug the wound. "Come on, buddy, stay with me!" His gasping got more and more frantic. Beside me, the officer took out his phone and began calling for an ambulance. I just kept holding him, shaking him, praying for him to be okay.

Eventually, his gaping got weaker and weaker. "Kai?!" I called out, shaking him, "Son, come on, hang in there, Daddy's here!" His eyes started glazing. "Kai! No, no, no, no, come on, stay with me! KAI!"

He went limp in my arms. I shook him, my heart feeling like a battering ram against my ribs. He didn't move. His arms and neck dangled limply as I tried shaking him. His chest wasn't moving.

"KAI!" I screamed out before devolving into a sobbing mess, nuzzling my face into his chest. The ambulance arrived about a half minute later. It felt like half an eternity.

They had to pry him out of my arms. "No! You can't have him!" I remember screaming at them, "You can't take my boy! NO!" I remember actually trying to get into a wrestling match with one of the paramedics, having to be pried away by the officer. I tried struggling against him, too, before devolving again into a mess of tears. "It's alright, sir." I remember him telling me as he restrained me, "Calm down, let's go outside."

I gave up and complied. There was nothing else I could do. It was over now.

This was last weekend. The police caught Andrew Miller and the other boy that day when they tried to run from the house. That's as much as I've heard with them. I don't know if they'll be tried or not, with how young they are. I hope they are. I hope they see what they'd done, what they've taken. More than this, I hope they see what happens when you decide to play with fire. Not only what it destroys for them, but what it destroys for those around them.

As far as the neighbor's little girl, I heard a day or two later that the paramedics managed to save her. I heard it was honestly a miracle she'd even made it onto the table at all with how much blood she'd lost. I agree, even if it was out of an internal sense of spite. She was alive, while my boy wasn't.

I know how selfish that is, but I can't lie here. Don't get me wrong, I was glad she was able to make it. I'm happy -- even a bit relieved, to a certain extent -- that she's alive. *At least he died making things right.*

As far as I go, well... There's not much TO say. I haven't left my house since then. Fortunately, thanks to press and media coverage on the situation, my boss actually decided to sympathize with my situation and told me to take the rest of the week off (unpaid leave, of course). If I'm going to be honest, though, it probably would've been just as well if he'd just gone ahead and cut me loose.

The funeral is two days from now. Once that's over, I won't be living here in Willow Ln. anymore. About two days ago, I started packing my stuff to move in with my folks up in kings Mountain for a while until I can find  another place of my own. *Assuming I can even BE on my own anymore.*

I don't know what I'm gonna do, honestly. Kai was all I had after Pamela passed. Now it was gone. Now I have nothing.

I'm sorry... I'm trying to hold it together, here. The house is so quiet now. I can't wait to get out of it for good.

I'm going to end this here. I don't want to think about him anymore right now. I just want to move away from this godforsaken neighborhood. Away from this house, these people and these kids. And most importantly, I want to get as far away as possible from the Blacktop.

I just want to get away...

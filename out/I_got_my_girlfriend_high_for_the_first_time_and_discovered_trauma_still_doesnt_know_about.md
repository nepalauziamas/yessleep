I asked my girlfriend if she would like to see what being high was like since I use it to help me sleep at night. I made sure she was fully comfortable with it and told her I wouldn’t accept anything but her feeling 100% about doing it. She said she felt comfortable and safe trying it with me. So the next day before work I went to the dispensary and picked her up some edibles so she didn’t have to smoke it because she hates smoking. So I got her some hybrid blue raz rings. I gave her one and then we went about our business and waited for about 90 min then decided alright well maybe her body is fighting the tolerance. Maybe I’ll have to try again some other time ya know? Well about 15 min later I decided to smoke so we could start laying down for the night. Well when I laid in bed it hit her….

At first she was laughing and giggly about how weird she felt and she was just having the time over her life but after about 5 min it’s like something snapped and she started twitching just kinda frozen there. She was still talking fine (for being high) but couldn’t really move much. She assured me she was okay but then she started crying and would start talking about some of her past trauma. She has told me everything she knows or atleast she can remember… she started what seemed like having flashbacks and started talking about the things her dad did to her but as if she was living in the moment. Like she was in a trance. I kept trying to “wake her up” even though she was staring and looking around as if she was in the flashback until finally I said “hey baby it’s me (said my name) your boyfriend” she instantly smiled and came out of the flashback. It made me tear up knowing my name can help pull her out of it because over the course of the next three hours she was going in and out of these flash backs but all of these things I had never heard her tell me before. I realized the weed opened up trauma she blocked from her memory as a little girl and she couldn’t remember any of this. Every time she went into a new flashback I felt like I could see her flashbacks in her eyes. Sometimes she would look directly at me and see nothing but her dad and be terrified of me until I said my name again which would pull her back out. When she went through I think a lot of her un-remembered trauma she made me pinky swear I wouldn’t tell her when she was sober if she couldn’t remember it again. I agreed to carry this burden from her. Over the course of the 3 hours I asked her if she wanted snacks and she agreed. I was hoping it would distract her from these flash backs but as we walked into the hallway she got scared and said she remembered when her dad would wake her up in the middle of the night to walk her into the kitchen. I tried to look into the snack cabinet to hide my eyes from the tears I was trying to hold back. When she asked what was wrong I told her they were “happy tears because you said you loved me” she made me pinky swear I was telling the truth. I did. I made alot of pinky promises tonight that I’m not proud of. But it’s it’s to protect her as best as I could then I will die on that hill. As the memories went on and the weed wore off she started to be more self aware and asked me what she didn’t want to remember I said you made me promise you not to tell you and I will not break that trust. I can’t help myself from crying and thinking about how she doesn’t remember anything over the course of the 3 hours. I now live with this…. She is currently asleep next to me finally relaxed as I lay here and cry typing this because as a man I don’t know how to express my emotions especially feeling like I watched these things happen in her eyes and to hear the amount of details she remembered only while high. Do you think it’s safe “with her agreement” to try again later down the line when she feels comfortable with it again? To see if it was a one time thing or an every time thing?

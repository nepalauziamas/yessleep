I am a very dumb person. I’m not mentally challenged or developmentally disabled; I’m “all there” in a cognitive sense—there's just not much that’s, well, *there.* I wouldn’t call myself stupid, as that seems just a bit too harsh, and neither would I describe my general behavior and outlook on life as idiotic. I have sense—but am often not very sensible. I think dim-witted would best describe me, both academically and socially. Yes, dim-witted is perfect.  

I have taken the time to belabor a description of my intelligence for a purpose that will become apparent later on in this short tale.  

Whilst casually strolling along in my neighborhood after having spent the better part of the day staring off into space—a frequently indulged activity of mine—I was suddenly accosted by two gentlemen. These gentlemen were plainly not of the area, for one bore the likeness of a newly risen ghoul, and the other of its duty-breaking caretaker. The former, having a sallow and sunken face—upon which actively feasted several plump maggots—stepped immediately in front of me and said, “Apologies for the interruption, but we require your viscera.”  

Being a generous person, I would’ve given them a portion of my innards, had I the capacity to subsist without them. But lacking that physiological aptitude, I was forced to decline. Perhaps expecting such a response, the other gentlemen—dressed in an all-encompassing trench coat, with a black tricorn atop his head—withdrew a pistol from the pocket of the aforementioned coat, and summarily fired it at my head.  

I fell, and the two gentlemen promptly began their business of unburdening me of my visceral organs; bringing forth a leather doctor’s bag and a large Tupperware bowl.  

Darkness fell over my vision, and after a short interim of rather calming nihility, I awoke—perceiving again the mundane world. I at once surmised that the bullet had not had a fatal impact due to my characteristic lack of grey matter. Not for the first time in my life, I thanked the Creator for having so generously blessed me.  

A glance at my stomach—the clothes that had covered it torn and discarded—showed the evidence of a small incision, along which ran several neat stitches. I remarked aloud that had I known I’d be spared death, I would’ve at least expected grislier results. But my surgeons had performed quite an immaculate operation, and I felt only slightly less gastrically encumbered. Apparently, they hadn’t needed much.  

*Ah ha!* I thought to myself, *the anatomist is yet another learned man whose teachings needn’t be so faithfully believed!* 

Arising, I continued along, my mood no less cheerful. But then certain baselessly profound thoughts came to me, as did some rather insightful observations of my environment - both clearly of a higher intellectual order than anything I’d previously been capable of. After a moment of contemplation—which in itself was rife with considerations and ideas wholly unsuitable—I came to the conclusion that I was under a spell of some sort; that I had not actually awakened from my abdominal operation.  

Coeval with this revelation, the world began to peel away, disintegrating like a wind-ravaged flower; and after a few moments I found myself staring up into the infinitely grim face of that dubiously dressed gentlemen.  

The ghoul (who was, I should mention, entirely naked) stood a few paces away, apparently keeping watch. The man recoiled, not anticipating my premature awakening. He asked how I had come to relieve myself of the spell, and I politely informed him that while the verisimilitude of the dream to reality was impeccable, the clarity and acuity of thought he had endowed me with was wholly unbefitting of my normal abilities.  

Crestfallen, he rose from his crouched position and stepped a few paces back, allowing me to collect myself and rise. He hadn’t yet cut into me, and I realized, dimly, that the actual operation probably required quite a bit of preparation – if the organs were to be harvested properly.  

The ghoul, overhearing the conversation, hissed and spat at his companion, deriding him for over-estimating my intelligence. By way of response, the would-be surgeon started to cry. Wanting to get on with my sojourn—for it was growing late and I am quite terrified of the dark—I announced that I was leaving them to their sepulchral business, and side-stepped the sobbing man. The ghoul—for whom my organs would’ve doubtlessly been harvested—maneuvered to block my path, and declared that he was still inexorably hungry. 

Not wanting him to go without food—for he was already severely emaciated—I resolved to help him in his troubles. Turning to the gentlemen I’d passed, I proceeded to rain blows upon him, until he was quite dead, or at least firmly unconscious. Then, gesturing to the collapsed man, I said, “Well, here is provender for your empty belly. Eat well, and be happy.”  

Not caring that I had pummeled his companion, the ghoul nodded, a hunger-induced lunacy etched upon his cadaverous face. He strode past and without any culinary preamble began tearing into the unconscious man.  

Just when the ghoul had unceremoniously created an aperture in the man’s belly, the man cried out in maddened agony – and I felt a rush of relief, for I had never committed the act of murder, and would’ve despaired to have wasted the opportunity on such a considerate man as that. (Considerate in the sense that he had kindly over-estimated my intellectual ability.)  

I promptly hurried along, noticing with a chill that the shadows about the area were lengthening, and that the sun had nearly achieved its plunge below the edges of the flat earth – leaving in its wake the far-spanning wings of night. The encroaching black was quite frightful, and an eerie trilling and chittering of evilly jubilant insects rose above the choked gurgles of the ghoul’s meal.  

I really, really do not like being outside under such frightening circumstances. Who knows what could be lurking in the depths of that illimitably pervasive darkness?

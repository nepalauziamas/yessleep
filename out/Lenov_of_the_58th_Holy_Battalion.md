Hello, my Name is Lenov, and I work for an organization responsible for the rehabilitation and relocation of 4th Dimensional Beings and Cryptids of Unknown Origins. We have gone by many names over the centuries; however, many prefer our proper designation: ANGELS. Angel Lenov of the 58th Holy Battalion reported my mission log to debrief.

	I arrived at the Portal Designated on my PDA, provided by recognizance in Halo Logistics. The LED screen blinks to life, expanding its luminescent teal green across my battle harness. I can see the Wings and eyes in the middle of my emblem and wipe it clean. "Shit, I hate cleaning missions. Rogue ops are the worst," I say, looking at the rest of the crew besides me sitting near the rocks in the valley. One of the crew stretches his arms and pops his neck—a sizeable, stout man of muscle and a bad attitude. You could smell the ax shower he took before he arrived. "Stop complaining, and we haven't even got to see what the op is we are cleaning yet," Nemoy says, scratching his blonde hair. 

	"Attention, Seraphim on Deck!" Our vice commander shouted at us to get off our asses and assume formation. He doesn't need the trouble—the bass thumping the ground with every stride. His armor is shrouded in high polished gold with white accents across. The head of a lion on his shoulder connects his cloak across the armor. The shimmer hurts my eyes as he walks past me. He turns, showing a sword sheathed, and a staff attached to his belt folded to a compact size. "Let me introduce myself; my name is Dagda. I come from Ireland from a nice trip with my friend Mórrígan." I turn and can see the white knuckles forming around the gun's and glaive at our possession. 

	"Our enemy is an escaped monster. Who broke the peace treaty must be cleaned and erased from this dimension before it can wreak havoc. We can not let the other organizations know about this creature, and we have them reporting enough on their wiki." Since the Code from the Deus Ex Machina himself went haywire, the multiverse has seen creatures we have not dreamed of and old ones we wished we had forgotten. "Now, prepare; we are jumping dimensions." We all stand in the circle of the light, and the air itself starts to shatter and crack. The surrounding ground and even sky look like broken glass and finally disperses. 

	As the shards of reality go away, total blackness envelops us. We hear Dagda unsheath his sword. In the name of all that is holy and just, I order say, "let there be light!" A large explosion erupts in front of us, and a barrier transmutes to protect us. I shield myself from the blinding light and hear the air shift and reality form around us. We look up and see the facility, from the looks of it, an old black site government prison. "What is this place, sir?" I ask, flashing my tac light on a decapitated body.

	"Not sure, as this floated into our multiverse from another. When we looked, it had a circle with an arrow through the floor and the name, *"site 13."* We had already cleared out the entities that remained before; however, there have been new readings from Halo and orders to contain and neutralize any threat here under extreme prejudice." I look over to the other troops, who are shaking their heads. These bodies that are here are fresh. Who else has been here? And how is it we don't even know?

	"All right, now everyone split up and move out. Bag em and tag them. No deaths on my watch, you hear? We are going to have a good op." We nod our heads and head out through the industrial research facility. The place must have been miles long by the looks, and we had to ensure it didn't breach anywhere else. One other teammate headed with me. The backup generator still hummed throughout the vents as we ambled down the corridor.

	"Hey, you are a veteran. Does shit get bad?" I look to the cadet and turn to the corpse splattered on the pillar of the building. "You were already dead when you came here. You took the same deal as me to get your wings, now shut up and keep moving." We make our way to the stairwell and find it propped open by a smashed skull in the way. I gesture to the cadet to move the body, and when he does, I split the cheese. The light is out here, and we have to use infrared. "Going dark." The goggles switch, and we climb slowly up the stairs. The reverb makes even the slightest movement amplified in sound. 

	We climb higher, and the stairs we walk across have changed direction, now facing the opposite way. What is the actual fuck is this place? Then, I hear a giant thud near the bottom of us. I aim my gun down toward the pit. Slowly, I can see heat trails rising. Something big was breathing at the bottom. Then I could see the eyes on my screen, and they were staring at me. Slowly I reach and disengage the safety. I look toward the cadet below me, and he follows suit. I look back down, and the eyes are gone. Frantically I search left, right, top and bottom and see nothing. "Do you see anything?" whispering to the cadet. "Negative," the cadet replied. Phew, he was gone.

	I look up, and the stairs have changed direction, going upward now. This shit was starting to give me a fucking headache. We climb up a few steps, then look down and hear breathing. The cadet was above me somehow, and I could hear deep breathing. I look up and see the breath."

I really don’t understand how this whole situation happened, and I’m glad I made it out with my life.

My name is David, a 28 year old, parent of two. My wife who is 29, Rosita, my two kids, Lucy, she’s seven, and Jacob, he’s four. My family lived in a small, average home in Salem, before I got a job offer in Fresno, which moved us closer to our family.

The company payed for 3/4 of our moving expenses, and after a long few week, we were in Fresno. And as I mentioned, since our family was so close, we decided to all meet together at our home for a family reunion, and I was the one to invite everyone, and I can admit this now, it was my worst mistake sending that invite out.

The reunion started at about 11:00 AM on Saturday. Exactly 17 people showed up, all 4 of my siblings, and their 5 kids total. Two of my wife’s siblings, and their two kids. Both of our parents showed up, making 15 people. Then came a problem, my wife’s final brother, Henry, came with his girlfriend, Amy.

I made a guest list, of my side of the family at-least, incase anyone cares.
My side of the family
Parents - Chase M63 and Violet F61
Siblings - Bill M35, Rachel F31, Abigail F28, Carter M24
Nieces and Nephews - Mason, Jordan, Annie, Kurt, Ross

The trouble started at game time, 3:00 PM, Henry had seemed kind of tired and loopy all day, but kept insisting that he was fine, so we kept him in the game. It was during a short battleship tournament, where my Niece Annie had to face Henry. They were both down to the final shot, Henry went first, but missed where the last piece of Annie’s last ship was, but Annie didn’t miss, and she won.

Henry shook her hand hard, and walked away into the house. Not even 20 seconds later, we heard bangs and smashes and shrieks, Jordan ran out of the house covered in blood. Me and my dad, Chase, both went in to investigate, both a weapon in hand. And all I saw was this giant monster, the color of a shadow, sharp-claws, and monstrous teeth, my dad told me yo run and get everyone else safe, so I did that, kids first were sent over the fence.

Jordan was the last one, due to his injuries, we had to be extra careful with him.

As we were about to send Jordan over, the back door and wall all crashed open.

“JUST GO ABIGAIL, WORRY ABOUT YOURSELF AND YOUR KID!” Is the last thing last I remember saying.

I finally got a good look at Henry, his “demon” form, I saw a lot of blood, and muscles forming from everywhere on Henry’s body. I didn’t even know how this was possible, but suddenly, the world went black.

I woke up at about 2:30 PM, at the start of the Battleship Tournament, I pulled my wife way from everyone, and told her everything, it is currently 2:56 PM as of typing these last words, I guess I’ll update you if I am alive, let’s pray that you get an edit to this post.

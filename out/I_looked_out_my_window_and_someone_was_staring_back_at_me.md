It all began with simple movements. Simple sounds. Every now and then my mom or grandma would hear a random clap. “Who did that?” They’d ask. But neither my brother or I had a clue what they spoke of. Some days we’d hear something falling in the other room. On other days we’d encounter much more. 

For instance, my family was gathered in our living room just talking. It was a Saturday afternoon. On the front wall we had our tv on a stand in the center of the room. Our loveseat on the right wall and our two recliners on the back wall. The last wall opened up into a dining room. Each of my family members sat in our own seat. Two of us in recliners and the other two on the loveseat. Nobody was near the tv remote. As we were talking, all of a sudden the tv turned on by itself. Each of us looked at each other puzzled. “You’re not sitting on the remote are you?” My grandma asked each of us. “No…” we answered. This would be just one of many paranormal experiences we’d begin to have.

A couple weeks later I would find myself sitting on the couch by myself In the living room. I was playing on my phone when all of a sudden my grandmothers CD player began to play music. What was peculiar about this time was that my grandma had just had it switched on the CD mode. Instead, it was playing FM radio. In order for that to have happened you had to physically move a switch two notches to the right for it to play radio. I immediately got up and told my mom and grandma who were in the other room. But neither believed me. 

Now I can go on about a couple of other instances where I was laying in bed and the lights came on by itself, but let’s get into the good stuff. 

The first experience that truly scared me was another time I was home alone. I was upstairs listening to music on my phone and coloring in my coloring book on the bedroom floor. All of a sudden I heard footsteps go down the hall downstairs and a door slam. Immediately I was alarmed and ran to my closet and locked the door. I sat there contemplating whether or not to call the police. I spent 30 minutes waiting before I decided to go check it out. Slowly, I gathered myself and began to very quietly walk downstairs and straight to the kitchen. I picked out the biggest knife I could find and slowly walked to the first door. I opened it, scanned the room, and to my relief nothing was there. Onto the next room. I opened the door again and prepared myself to see someone there. Nothing. Goosebumps started to form on the back of my neck. I felt I needed to get out of there. I ran out the house and to the temple right down the street where my mom was at. I quickly found her and embraced her as I cried. 

From there we’d have similar experiences. Sounds of someone falling on our wooden staircase, my mother, hearing foot steps leading up to her bed at night, then feeling something (or someone) sit on the foot of her bed. And lastly, my dog barking at the corner of my room at 3am randomly while Nothing was there. Still, nothing would prepare me for one of the last experiences I’d have before moving out.

It was 6am. I had a dream that while I was in my bed, someone was watching me. I got up and stood on my bed, turning around to the window that sat above it. I decided to look out my window to see if someone was out there. To my surprise, a man in all black was staring back at me and immediately he ran away the moment he saw he stare back at him. I was horrified. I awoke from my nightmare to the hair on my neck standing. Someone was watching me. I sat there, frozen in my bed for a solid half hour before getting up and running downstairs without even checking my window. I was horrified. I cried in my mothers arms once again, not knowing what to do at this point. I decided to sleep with my lights on from then on. That night and every night forward for three weeks, I woke up 3 times a night at the exact same time on the dot.  2:30, 3:30, and 5:30am. Every night on the dot. 

To put the icing on the cake, the rest of my family just moved out of the house this year. Contractors began to work on the house and my grandma decided to go over one day and see how the house was coming along. Three men were working that day. I’m not sure how it came into conversation, but the men asked my grandmother if she knew the house was haunted as they had felt a bad energy. To her surprise that they knew, she replied with a “yes.” How did they know? Apparently, while working in the garage, the three men saw a man, dressed all in black, standing there in the middle of it all. 

To this day I still think about that house and shiver just thinking about what could have happened if we decided to stay there longer.

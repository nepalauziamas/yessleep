So, for all my life I've taken hunting trips at least once a year. I've done this for a variety of reasons, to see nature and geography, being with nature, travelling and the like, and just generally getting out into the world. It's also been a bit of a tradition since my family always took me as a young boy. I try not to hit the same spot twice, unless something really catches my eye about it, and I mean *really* catches my eye. I've seen some wild stuff out there, so it takes a lot for a place to make me want to come back. Met a lot of interesting people too, some even in the good kind of interesting!

&#x200B;

Being a Christian southern boy, though, the hurting animals bit always has bothered me a little. Don't get me wrong I do enjoy hunting, but I have to make absolute sure that none of the creature goes to waste. It makes it hard when you accidentally shoot some little critter you thought was a deer, and now have to skin and eat a skunk, but hey I stick by my morals. Anyways one thing that always stuck to me was the Native American view on nature. That sacred outlook on all of God's creatures and the solace you can find in respecting its beauty.

&#x200B;

So when I heard about an ancient Native hunting ground up in a secluded mountain, far away from all the bustle of anyone nearby, I got foolishly giddy. Turns out I learned soon enough just why they called it Bloodbath Mountain.

&#x200B;

The Mountain rested atop a town just beneath it called Sundown Valley. It was a mining town that ran dry in the '90s, now the whole place is completely desolate. There wasn't much recorded about the little town, but the mountain itself has some rich cultural history. Like I said, it used to be a Native American hunting ground where they would find bears, deer, rabbits and all kinds of berries and fruits. The mountain was very sacred to this tribe, and legend has it that they even cursed it.

&#x200B;

There were multiple articles online about all of the different theories of what happened to them, all revolving around one letter sent by an American officer to his general. Basically in the 1820s, the American army wanted to dispel these Natives, offering them a treaty to buy their lands and relocate them. When they returned, the tribe was missing completely, spare one, who told them they had been granted the spirit of a horrible creature inside of a bear to defend the mountain, and had all fled to its lair. This creature was the mythical Bear of Bloodbath Mountain. The officer was sent with a battalion to destroy the tribe, not a single man had returned, and not a body was found. Thus, Bloodbath Mountain's name.

&#x200B;

Eventually the land was colonized in 1863, after an assessment was made that no Natives remained there. Nobody knows what happened to any of them, but around 500 people accounting all of the battalion and tribespeople vanished. Sundown Valley was then settled over where the tribe once lived, and some say that they could still hear wailing screeching down the mountain. Then there's all the theories that the Bear was a Wendigo or a Skinwalker, or just that everything was genocide mixed with conspiracy. If you'd seen all the blurry jpegs I've sifted through of "PiCtUreS oF ThE BeAr" you could count the pixels on one hand.

&#x200B;

Backstory isn't what matters with that month I spent up there. It's only context for what I went through. Whatever theory you're thinking happened next, just let me explain and tell me I'm crazy in the end. So let's begin.

&#x200B;

I finally met myself with the town of Sundown Valley and it was in much worse condition than I'd ever imagine. The old brick house that had stood for over a century were toppled over into ruin. There was a very fine silence to the wind, only exacerbated by the rustling of leaves in their tall trees. The town's roads were cracked and bleached by the hot Georgian Sun. My steps down the narrow streets echoed.

&#x200B;

I passed through the ghostly town of Sundown Valley and into the dark woods that surrounded it. They too were eerily still, no crinkling of dried foliage around me, just the quaint falling of autumn leaves against the soft ground. I usually like being this far out away from noise and people, but that forest just unsettled me. There was nothing natural how quiet it was.

&#x200B;

I held my rifle close to my chest as the Sun began to dim amongst the clouds. I trekked deep through the woods, finding a perch for my gun to rest. Then, all I could do was wait until nightfall.

&#x200B;

Hunting is much like fishing in a sense, that waiting for the tiny creature to bite the bait so you could yank the hook. These are the most peaceful moments in a hunter's life, sitting very patiently as they await their victim. In these woods, I didn't feel that peace. There was no solace in the chirping birds, no tranquility in the shimmering moon through the trees. My lamp felt like it kept something at bay.

&#x200B;

I'd met many a monster in my journeys, massive elk in mating season, hunting cougars waiting to pounce me, and towering bears that smell my breath, and not one of them made me feel that strong of a sense of unease. They always had this sort of realistic element to them that humanized them. I knew what they were there for, and I could relate to their struggles. When you can't see that monster under darkness, there is nothing you can understand about it other than the knowledge that it sees you.

&#x200B;

This was the first week or so there, that stillness. Even through the day, and using the tools I'd brought with me to last out there the month, I'd never felt safe. Yet all I looked, nothing was revealed. But you could just feel some eye watching you move. Every noise was so loud in pitch silence. Every light was so bright in absolute darkness. Through my entire stay there, I never saw a single animal but one. The first week was offputting, it paled in comparison to the two weeks that followed.

&#x200B;

It was the subtle things that made me fear it so much. A tree that was normal a day ago, now covered in massive scratches up and down. Steps with no feet. Whispers with no mouths. It set in stone that I was right, that I wasn't alone out here. It set in stone that it saw me, and didn't want me there. The wailing at night, I heard it, but it didn't sound human. It didn't sound like any animal I'd heard either. I know just about every animal in and out in the whole continent of North America, this was one I didn't know.

&#x200B;

One night, I'd called it in and returned to my tent, when my light shimmered off an odd rock right in front of the opening. I didn't notice it there before, and I would've. It was so pale that it reflected light like a mirror. I leaned over, picked it up, and felt my fingers slide into holes on the opposite side. I flipped it around and gazed straight into the hollowed eyes of the human skull that had been placed for me to find. Then in the not so far distance the wailing cried once more. I didn't sleep much that night, clutching my rifle until the Sun rose again, I understood that the message was clear.

&#x200B;

The only reason I stayed in that place was because I had made a pact with myself. When I was little, my parents took me out hunting, still teaching me the dos and don'ts. I had shot a cute rabbit, and felt awful about it, being one of my very first kills in my life. I was sobbing and wanted to go home, when my father pulled me aside and sat down with me by the stream. We looked out into the flowing waters for a few minutes, he didn't say anything until he put his arm on my shoulder.

&#x200B;

"Hey, kid. I know it's tough. Nobody likes taking lives, it doesn't feel right. The thing is, life ends either way, and this is how it ends for most of these animals. You can't go home and pretend like that rabbit has a certainty of being there tomorrow, it just doesn't. When we come out here, we make it quick for them, dying easy, and we make sure that they don't die in vain. He'll make us a meal tomorrow night, and his fur will give us some money to help us live under a roof."

&#x200B;

I sniffled and looked up at him, "But why do *we* have to do it? Why do *I* have to take its life?" I asked.

&#x200B;

He looked seriously at me and told me, "'Cause if we don't, something worse probably will, there's a lot of things that want to eat that little critter, but only we can be the ones that let it have respect and dignity. You hold every shot you take in your heart, and never let it go."

&#x200B;

I gathered my courage and took a deep breath. "Okay, I understand."

&#x200B;

He smiled at me and said, "So you won't leave?"

&#x200B;

"No, sir."

&#x200B;

"And you wanna come next time right?"

&#x200B;

"Yes, sir. I promise."

&#x200B;

After that there wasn't much that could keep me out of the woods. I'd felt scared before, just because I felt scared now didn't mean I was going to leave. "I have a right to these woods just as much as this thing does," I thought. I was the furthest thing from right.

&#x200B;

It started out with flashes, whizzing past me like a passing mosquito, faster than I could even comprehend. I couldn't ever catch a full glimpse of it, but it made sure I knew it was there. It would scratch the trees just behind me, driving me mad trying to find it. It was the only creature out here for miles, and it was taunting me. It made sure I knew I was not the hunter here. A few days after the skull incident, it tore up my tent, so I had to sleep out in the cold on the leaves, only lit up by a makeshift fire.

&#x200B;

There was a night I even saw it's glowing eyes staring into me as I attempted to sleep. Clutching my rifle, I took a shot at it, but it was gone. I knew it was watching me sleep, but for some reason it never killed me. It was making a spectacle, it wanted me to know it was the one in control. The Bear was real, and it wanted me to leave.

&#x200B;

I was travelling in the day, my mission had changed. I was no longer hunting animals, I was hunting a monster. This creature was not nocturnal, so there was no point in waiting until night. At this point I was near the peak of the mountain, the cold was strong. Soon enough, I would be low on supplies and this zenith would be too cold to survive in. Seeking shelter, I stumbled across a cave with Native carvings in the entrance of the rock.

&#x200B;

As I entered, the winds bellowed outside, I believed that I was in the lair of the beast. I crafted myself a makeshift torch out of a branch and kindling, since this could very well be a Wendigo, a beast of Native legend that was weak to fire. The inside was dark. It had a winding tunnel deep into the mountain. I held my torch close and my rifle ready.

&#x200B;

I heard heavy steps pattering around me, they echoed all over the cave. Crashes and thumps followed me as I walked. One of us weren't going to leave here. The ground was so cold and wet, until it felt sticky. I lowered my light to see a deep red paste covering the floor, stretching all over the walls and ceiling of the tunnel. "What the hell," I mumbled to myself, immediately hearing the phrase repeated down the way in my own voice. I followed it with my rifle up.

&#x200B;

The paste got thicker as I got deeper, it was hard for me to move. The walls were now coated with it. The cave was getting narrower as it no longer was a carved of rock, but of the substance. The Wendigo was at home here, taunting me always from nearby. I entered a vast opening at the heart of the nest, and saw figures swallowed by the mush, they were silhouettes of people. I shined my light up to one, still seeing remnants of what it once was. Bone protruded from its chest, and eyes looked out of a half missing head.

&#x200B;

Then the figure moaned.

&#x200B;

I fell to the ground, feeling something solid under my hand. It was an old musket. This must've been some kind of Skinwalker, but what kind of Skinwalker moves that fast? I got up and turned around to the exit to witness that this Skinwalker was right in front of me. I had never truly seen it until then. It didn't have human features despite the cataract filled eyes. Its body was made of the thick slimy slush that covered the cave. It had massive claws that shined to my lamp. It stood on four leg-like appendages, about twelve feet tall and bulky.

&#x200B;

I shot at the abomination, and it vanished quickly into the ground. The monster sunk into the fleshy coating on the floor and rose behind me, slashing my back. I screamed in pain, stumbling and running out to the tunnels, dropping my torch. The cave quickly turned into an oven, as I ran in darkness through the cave. I had stuck right the whole way, so I knew I could hug the left and make my way out. The only illumination was the waving glow of flame behind me, the sticky hive slowing my retreat.

&#x200B;

I jumped out of the cave, noticing that the flame had died out. A thick smoke cough out of the cave, and I saw the whole mountain excrete the same. The town below released its own burst of smog. The nest lit like a match and burnt with a flash. The Bear of Bloodbath Mountain was killed.

&#x200B;

I made my way down the mountain through the next couple weeks, and finally to the town. Walking passed the old scorched buildings, the smell of burning meat filled my nostrils. Taking a peak inside, I found what I didn't notice last time, people, all in different stages of decomposition. They were all charred from the fire, rubble pushed the crumbling rocks from their bodies. The inhabitants of Sundown Valley didn't leave because it "went dry", they were all eaten by The Bear.

&#x200B;

As for the lands of Bloodbath Mountain, there were many patches of char beneath the soil, the creature slid across those patches to stalk me. The land was being reoccupied even before I fully escaped that horrible place, birds, squirrels, deer etc.

&#x200B;

I don't know what the Natives did to that bear, nor why it was so reluctant on killing me. The whole experience has made me terrified of the outdoors I once loved so dearly. I can only hope that I killed the only one.

&#x200B;

Before I do end, I do have a question for anybody willing to answer. After I got back, I noticed the maiming that the monster gave me has become blistered and filled with reddish pus. Does anybody know anything about getting rid of infections? I'm going to the hospital for it tomorrow, but I'm just worried since I've never seen an infection like this.

Hi I’m Tyree I’m currently 17 and love to play videos games they take a huge role in this story as long as I can remember I would always stay up late playing video game to the point where my schedule would be horrible I remember being small and having so much fun all night and sleeping during the day care free until one day when I was about 15 I’m going about my night gaming like



 I usually do until a certain wave of drowsiness hit me it got harder and harder to play and my eyes strained and felt heavy so heavy it was like holding weights up for a certain period of time I remember faintly trying to be responsible knowing I’m not a kid anymore and need to have a good sleep schedule so I get in bed my sheets felt like laying in warm clouds and my ac blasting cooling the room as if I was in a freezer but the warmth of the sheets comforted me it was abt 1:30 in the morning so I though not as bad I remember waking up in the middle of the night upright


 which was odd I sleep on my side I thought to myself “my throat is pretty dry water would be good rn” without thinking I got up in a rush of excitement but shortly  noticed I couldn’t move



actually I couldn’t seem to move anything below my nose I’ve heard abt this b4 I thought to myself this was sleep paralysis I’m sure everyone knows what this is now I slowly realized I could move my eyes I franticly moved them in a state of panic until my eyes caught the gaze of something that made my blood run cold in the corner of my room laid a humanoid like creature completely composed of shadows like a duppy or an locked character in a video game I knew this could happen but I didn’t think it was real all could do is flare my nose and open and close my eyes


hoping to get rid of this hallucination the creature crawls on all fours and stands right over me I tried to let out a scream to no avail it’s like I could hear it in my head but not anywhere else I passed out I woke up the next morning terrified I didn’t know if I was gts again being a dumb 15 year old i didn’t learn my lesson and continued to have a poor sleep schedule


 over the course of these two years I’ve gotten used to sleep paralysis it doesn’t affect me no matter what I see a witch a shadow monster 


I’ve gotten completely over it and just sat through it  I haven’t been affected with it In a while until last night I awoke normally 3:00 am typical can’t move anything eyes and nose only i didn’t see anything I thought I have gotten used to it and figured my brain would try it hardest to make my hallucinations seem real so I prepared myself then something felt different as soon and I see my room door slowly swing and creak open the creaking noise burrowed it’s way inside my head it felt louder then normal I made a gaze what seem to be a homeless looking woman I laughed inside my head thinking this is the best my brain could do the lady appeared in tattered clothes but I didn’t feel like staring hard because I felt like my brain would make her come toward me or something so I squinted ever so slightly so it appeared my eyes where closed the lady had a  small pocket knife



I watched as she paced back and forth in my room it seemed like she was murmuring to herself I was terrified but yet somehow inna weird way proud bc I thought my brain was getting more creative I had no fear until the lady speed walked to my bedside  she I felt absolutely horrified as 



I realized I could smell her she stunk of cigarettes and liquor I froze  closed my eyes fully and begged my body to let me wake up I tried my hardest to snap out the trance or to even wiggle a finger or toes to no avail I couldn’t snap out of it I just sat there hearing her heavy breathing I then Felt the right side and my face go cold and a sharp pain go down my face which immediately made my face hot it was like applying icy hot lol I was confused and passed out due to pure fear i fainted I woke up mid day to my face burning I immediately thought about last night and ran to the bathroom I stood there horrified at the gash in my face and the and went back into my room to recollect my thoughts I went into my room and my blood ran cold I smelled cigarettes and liquor was I actually hallucinating last night or was it real I’m shaking my while writing this I have to go tell my mom

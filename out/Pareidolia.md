Forgive me for any typos or bad grammar, it's late and I just wanted to get this all down on paper before I loose it.

We had been married for four years, four happy years. When we met in high school it started kind of in a round about way. See, we had seen each other fro a distance quite a few times, but our circles never quite overlapped enough for us to actually meet. It wasn't until a few years after that we met again in college and found out that we'd both been secretly pining over the other during those distant stares. We really hit it off and 3 years later we got married. It wasn't anything big or flashy, she was a modest kind of woman; a wedding at the local lake and a reception at the rental pavilion near by was all it took to make her happy. I wanted to give her a princess wedding but the job market was hard and money was tight. "Were going to be there for us", she said, "not to show off." She was just happy to be together, and every moment as such was a simple and pure joy for her. She was perfect to me in every way. Her laugh, her smile, the way her eyes got when she looked at me. You could always see the happiness in her eyes. Even if somedays didn't go how she planned or if work had been stressful, you could see in her eyes that she was happy. You could see the love in her eyes.

&#x200B;

When it first started I woke up to my alarm and hit the snooze button reflexively. I always set three, four, sometimes five alarms. I wasn't a morning person. I laid my head back down and re-nestled myself into bed. I had just started to doze off when she got up. She went to work a little earlier than I did, she was keyholder at the local big box store. 

I heard her doing her usual quite shuffle, and wondered how she woke up so energized every morning. We usually went to bed about 10:30 but lately shed been staying up later, reading and journalling after I went to bed. It was her quite relax time I supposed. I had woke up one night to use the bathroom, and found her still writing at 2 in the morning, I asked her if she was coming to bed and she gave me a quiet "mhm". I shuffled my way back to bed and set an extra early alarm in case I had to wake her up, but sure enough, when I woke up the next morning she was already up.

Back to that morning though, I was pondering her seeming immunity to exhaustion and started to drift back off when my next alarm started to go off. I am so used to the second alarm that I hit snooze just as it started. I started to open my eyes when I heard a whispering from the bathroom. At first I thought she was on the phone and almost didn't think anything of it. However, when I walked in the bathroom for my morning piss, I opened the door and she immediately stopped whispering. When I looked down I saw her, still holding her toothbrush and crouched by the wall where the air vent was. She sat there a second before explaining she thought there was a mouse in the vent and she was trying to coax him out so she could rescue him and take him outside. This sounded like something she would do, as she was always saving bugs and critters she found in the barn and around the house, so I didn't think much of it and went on getting ready for work.

It didn't seem like anything strange at the time, but thinking back on it, that was the first time I noticed the change in her eyes. They seemed duller somehow, like a thin film of milk was over them. That day however, when I came home from work they seemed normal so I chalked it up to how early in the morning it had been.

I asked her if she had been able to save and rehome the mouse yet and she looked a bit uncomfortable and told me no, she thought he may have got scared and crawled deeper in the vent. "No worries", I told her, "I'm sure he will climb back up and if you don't see him tomorrow I can take the panel off the duct in the basement and put some food in there for him." This seemed to relax her and she smiled that big kind of smile where her cheeks get rosy and her eyes squeeze up and told me thank you and to be careful.

&#x200B;

The next few days were kind of hit or miss. Sometimes she would think she saw him and whisper in her rescue voice. You know that kind of voice most people do, when they talk to their babies or pets? That was the voice she used when she was trying to befriend an animal she aimed to rescue. The walls in our place are pretty thick so I could never quite make out what she was saying but I could hear the gentleness in the tone. It was soothing even to me. 

&#x200B;

Well it happened that on the fourth day of this, I had got home a few hours earlier than normal and she was still working. With a little bit of free time I tried to think of how to entertain myself before she got home. With nothing on tv and no beer in the fridge leftover, I decided to clean some around  the house. I vacuumed the stairs and swept the dinning room and tried to remember the last time I had swept in the basement. Our basement was kind of half converted into my workshop for typewriters and old knick knacks I was restoring. I hadn't had the time to tinker any in a few months due to work so I made my mind up to give it a good once over with the broom and maybe check water heater while I was down there.

I opened the door and walked down the wood steps to the basement, whoever had built the house had decided to put the light switch at the bottom of the stairs instead of the top. I assume this was to save a bit of wire and still charge the then-owner for the longer amount. I reached the string and pulled the switch. The lights clicked on and everything looked like I remembered it, sans the new layer of dust accumulating. I made a mental note to give everything a good wipe down if I had time and got to work sweeping. There wasn't much to sweep, just mostly a fine dust the broom would streak but not sweep very well. I ended up just putting it up and taking a wash rag to wipe down my tools and parts and called it good.

Next order of business was the water heater. It was one of the newer ones that are ultra efficient, it works great but you have to flush it out every 6 months too keep it working right, so I got my screwdriver. The layout of our basement has a main room and then a smaller room for guests to stay in, and there is a little closet off of that room that the water heater shares with the blower from the air conditioner and some duct work. 

I opened the closet to check the water heater and when I did, the undeniable smell of something dead hit my nostrils. I looked around for the source, and my nose told me it was coming from the air duct. I went and got my socket set and took the panel above the blower off and found it's source. There was a little field mouse in there that looked like it had been chopped by the blower fan. It was a bit of a mess and I wasn't sure if I was more sad or grossed out by seeing the little guy there. I realized this must have been the one my wife was trying to save and he must have fell down there somehow. Not wanting to upset her I went upstairs and checked to make sure she wasn't home yet. I didn't see her car in the drive, so I got some gloves and a bag to take downstairs. The poor creature cleaned up pretty easy given his small size. I noticed a thick layer of dust buildup while I was in there and thought it must be blowing out that fine dust in the basement. I made a mental note and proceeded to bury my poor mouse friend in the backyard by the creek. 

I had just got to the back door when my wife came in the front.

"Hey honey, how was work?" I asked.

"Eh, it was a bit chaotic, we got pretty busy but it wasn't to bad. What are you doing out in the heat?" She asked.

Not wanting to upset her I told her I was checking the mower in the shed and that seemed to satisfy her.

The rest of that evening was nice. We had dinner and watched a movie on Hulu and had a few glasses of our very high class box wine. She went upstairs to her craft room to journal for a bit and I got ready for bed. I kissed her cheek and we said our goodnight's and I went to bed.

I woke up that morning and vaguely recalled some wild dreams. I never remember the details but I've had vivd nightmares since I was a kid. I usually remember bits of them, kind of like still images or screenshots from a movie, and I always remember the feelings. We have a big king bed and while my side looked like a hurricane from me flailing in my sleep, her side just had the corner pulled down where she had got up for the day. I fixed my side of the bed back neatly and smiled at the humor of the mental image I got pondering how she slept so calmly while I flailed around two feet away. 

I pulled her corner back up and walked towards the bathroom. I heard her whispering to the vent again and when I opened the door she stopped. I asked her if she had any luck as I got my toothbrush. 

"Not yet, but I think I'm getting closer." She said, and I felt some guilt about the day before.

It was a normal thing to say but the way she said it sounded different than her normal voice. A stranger wouldn't have noticed but I could tell something was off. The tone was right but it was flatter, duller sounding. I figured she was just still waking up and went on about my day. On my way to work I called the HVAC company and told them about the dust and they said they could come out that evening. I also told them about her mouse just in case there was more somewhere and they said they let me know if they found any.

&#x200B;

The day went well and they came that evening, everything checked out they said. They cleaned out the lint and said they weren't sure where it was coming from but just to keep an eye on it. They also told me they ran a scope of some sort around the ductwork and didn't find anymore mice so the one I found was probably a one off that had got trapped in the vent somehow. I thanked them and they gave me the invoice and went on their way.

I went inside and told my wife everything except the bit about the mouse. As I talked about the lint buildup and what they said the possible causes were I got a good look at her eyes in the light and they were definitely duller than before. That happy glint was still there but it was noticeably less. I supposed being a manager was stressful and told her I would get the dishes that night so she could just relax. She smiled and gave me a kiss. The rest of the night was pretty normal and eventually I found myself once again hitting snooze on my alarm.

I hit the snooze button and tried to go back to sleep but something was bothering me. I couldn't place it right off but it was sort of like that feeling when you know you are forgetting something but can't remember what. I tried to brush it off but the feeling just grew. If I wasn't going to get back to sleep I may as well get up and get ready for the day. I slid out from the covers and started fixing the bed. 

As I smoothed my side back out I heard her whispering again but this time it was a little clearer and I could make out some bits of it. I looked at our bedroom door and saw a sliver of light from the bathroom and figured the door must not have latched when she closed it. I walked to her side of the bed and started to pull her sheet corner up when I paused. Her voice sounded the same but it was odd. She sounded like she was talking fast. I mean really fast. I almost couldn't understand it but every now and then I'd catch part of it.

"doesn't mean I have to"

"if that's what he wants"

"be a good"

"well then you'll"

"yes yes I do"

There was a sudden pause. I strained to listen when suddenly she said as clear as day;

"If it's what you want, I'll do it."

This last line wasn't in her sweet voice, it was her normal voice. She sounded very firm and very final, like she had made some sort of final resolve to do something. It sounded sad too.

Now, I'm not always the fastest, but this seemed like a very odd conversation and I started to wonder things. Shes seemed a bit distant lately and hasn't had that spark in her eyes, and my husband brain started to wonder if she was actually on the phone and having some sort of affair. True we spent our evenings together but she always came to bed after I fell asleep. How do I know she isn't going out for a few hours? She had been more tired seeming the last few days and had been working late for a few weeks now. What time does the store normally close? And the final nail in the anxiety coffin was that the mouse had been gone now for at least a few days, so who was she talking to?

The anxiety started to grow and I decided not to panic, I would just talk to her and see what was actually going on. I trusted my wife, she had never given me any reason not to, and even if something was going on, I loved her and felt confident we could work it out. I wanted to ask her that morning but I wasn't sure yet how to broach the subject so I decided to think on it for a day or two and try to figure out how to approach it.

The next few days went by with the same cycle as the last few and I still hadn't thought of a good way to bring up the subject. I finally decided the direct way was the best way, and decided not to hit snooze in the morning and instead get up and walk in while she was still talking to see what was going on. If it was nothing then I could just play it off and tell her I just woke up early. So thats what I did.

That morning I got up as soon as the alarm went off. I must have had nightmares again because my covers were again a mess and I felt a heavy feeling in my chest. That coupled with the anxiety of how the next few minutes would go, well, it didn't feel great. 

I slid out of bed and walked as quitly as I could towards the bathroom door. We have a soft carpet and I had learned how to walk in a way you couldn't hear at all when I had been on nightshift so I didn't wake her up on my nights off. 

I was two steps away from the door when I heard her in that same sad voice say to whoever it was "He's almost here and I think he suspects." With that I panicked and I grabbed the handle and flung the door open. I stepped in fully expecting to see my wife with her phone in hand crouched by the vent again. 

What I saw instead I will never forget.

I jumped through the door confident I had caught an affair and instead of seeing her looking down at the vent, she was looking directly at me. Her mouth was tightly closed and her jaw was clenched hard. She was completely naked and had one hand on the wall, the other was up as if to shield her eyes from the lighting. I stared for a moment in bewilderment as her eyes looked completely flat. Any joy, any love, any happiness was gone from them. The misery in her eyes was tangible. I could feel it just by looking at them. She broke her stare and immediately jumped up and ran to our bedroom. 

I ran after her begging her to tell me what was going on but she locked the door and yelled about being late for work. She opened the door minutes later fully dressed and ran past me before I could even think of what to say. I didn't even know how to react. I didn't chase her, I let her go and I listened as I heard the door lock and her car startup and leave out the driveway.

&#x200B;

I called into work and told them I was taking a floating vacation day. The shift lead said that was fine and told me to enjoy my day off.

I spend the next few hours sitting on the couch trying to understand what I had done wrong. As far as I could remember we ever had any big fight, we didn't have any real problems, the normal couples stuff, but nothing serious. We weren't wealthy but we were worlds better than we had been when we first got married. I mean we were well enough off not to have money troubles causing problems in our relationship. We didn't have any children by her decision so there was no stress there. Had I not made her feel loved somehow? Did she not feel appreciated anymore? So many things ran through my mind. 

&#x200B;

As I sat there I began to get a nagging feeling. Something I had noticed but didn't have an answer for. When I had opened the door that morning, she didn't have her phone in her hands. She was nude as can be so there were no pockets for her to put it in, and when she ran out to the bedroom she hadn't been holding it. So where had she put it? I went up to the bathroom and looked around, the trashcan was empty, so I picked up the bath rug, no luck there. I checked the closet in case she had put it behind some towels but nothing there either. Stumped I closed the lid to the toilet and flopped down on it to rest for a moment. I looked around the room perplexed and I remembered the vent and I gazed down at it. There was a silicone seal around it, a previous owners fix on the cheap, so there was no way she could have lifted it up without breaking the seal. 

Then I noticed a dark spot just above the vent. I had never noticed it before and I wondered what had left it. It looked like some sort of brown stain but there was nothing in the bathroom that would have made that color mark. I sat lost in the momentary relief from the feeling of panic about an affair, with my eyes transfixed on this spot. The longer I looked the more defined the shape got. If I squinted just slightly, it almost seemed to make a face. It was kind of funny, it reminded me of when my siblings and I would lay out in the yard and find shapes in the clouds. After sitting like that for what seemed like hours I finally got up and tried to keep my mind off things by staying busy. I cleaned my car and organized the tools in the basement. I went out to the barn and tinkered some on the 165 (its a mid size tractor if you're wondering). It had a slight miss in it and I got it running right. 

It took me all day and I had been so focused on it that I hadn't noticed the sun starting to set. I put my tools up and closed up the barn. I looked up at the sky as I walked toward the house and thought about my wife when I first met her as I looked up at the watercolor sky. I walked up the hill and got to the porch and saw that her car was in the driveway. Usually you can hear the gravel when someone comes up the drive but I must have missed that too. It's easy to do when I get focused on work.

I fished my keys from my pocket and noticed the lights were out in her craft room. Normally she would be journaling at this time. I put the key in the lock and turned it, opening the door to a dark home. All the lights were off which was a bit odd. Maybe she went to bed early, tired from the stress, or trying to avoid my questions. "There's always tomorrow." I said to myself. I made my way to our bedroom fairly easy, we had lived here long enough I could make my way around without the lights on, and I undressed in the dark. I sat on the side of the bed and in case she was still awake I whispered that I loved her, and that we could work it out whatever she had gotten into, and I crawled under the covers.

I immediately knew when I laid down that she wasn't there. I thought maybe she went to sleep on the couch so I grabbed my phone and went to check on her and bring her a blanket. I used the light from my phone screen to see and when I got there, it too was unoccupied. Maybe her craft room? I thought to myself, but when I looked, she wasn't there either. Her car was there so I knew she had to be around somewhere. The only place I hadn't looked was the basement. 

I shuffled over to the basement door and opened it. When I clicked the button on the side to get the screen light nothing came on. I pressed it again and it flashed the screen for the battery being dead so I had to carefully feel my way down the stairs. I tested each stair with my foot before I stepped down and after what seemed like an eternity I finally felt the floor. I waved my hand around in front of me until I felt the string from the switch brush my hand. I pulled it and the light flashed on.

My mind still cannot process what I saw. I can remember it clear as day, but its blurry at the same time. Like my brain is trying to protect itself from what it's seen. My wife, oh my wife. It looked like some sort of scene from a horror film, there was blood smeared on the floor, on the walls, handprints that turned to smears and streaks. There were things trailing out from her that should have been inside her. There are no words for the scene that was laid out in front of me. 

I wanted to run to her, I wanted to hold her, I wanted to tell her it was ok, that we could fix it, that nothing on this earth would make me stop loving her, that we could work it out. But that was gone now. She was gone. My emotions and body went completely numb in that moment, the only feeling I had was of vomit rising in my throat. I ran out of that room as fast as I could and up to our bathroom and gripped the toilet as my body purged itself. Once it had slowed enough for me to catch my breath I called 91 1. I couldn't even tell them what had happened, I couldn't even get the words out. All I could say was "help" and I began dry heaving and sobbing again. My legs gave out and I laid there curled on the floor dry heaving and sobbing, broken forever. My eyes once again rested on that stain on the wall, it looked like it had grown and got darker. I couldn't think anymore and as a diversion, my brain used every once of power it had to focus on the stain instead of what was going on around me. It not only had grown, but was darker now too. It looked so much like a face now, its amazing what our minds will do when stressed beyond their breaking point. I could make out eyes that seemed to be looking straight out, straight into mine. 

It was staring into this face that the first responders found me. I couldn't walk so they gently lifted me up onto a stretcher and carried me out. After the hospital had me medicated enough I could talk again the police came in and asked me some questions. I answered them as best as I could. They seemed suspicious but told me thanks and sorry for my loss and all the awkward sympathies you can give a person who has just gone through the unimaginable. They gave me their cards and told me they would keep in touch. 

The hospital released me after a three day hold and as much as I never wanted to return to that house, I had no other living arrangements available. The investigators had taken a look through the house and then the cleanup crew had come. They did a good job I'm told, but I still haven't gone in the basement since then. The investigators came back and asked to look through her personal affects and I told them they could have whatever they wanted. They took 4 boxes of journals from her craft room along with some seemingly random bits of things. After four months they called me up and told me I had been cleared.

"What happened? How did she-" I wasn't sure how to word what I wanted to ask.

"I won't go into specifics but it seems to be self inflicted." The detective told me.

I listened in silence, I couldn't even begin to process how someone could do that let alone my wife.

"There's a lot in her journals, were going hang on to them a while longer, until the investigation is done, but they seem to be in line with the coroners report. If you want them back we will notify you when they've been released and you can pick them up. I don't normally do this but if it's easier on you I can drop them off. I know you've been through a lot." The detective went on,  "it seems she was going through some sort of acute psychosis, hearing things, seeing things, that sort of thing. The medical folks said she wrote a lot about seeing patterns and shapes. A sort of, well I think they call it pareidolia. They said everyone does it to some degree but in extreme cases it can be a symptom of a lot of things. They aren't really sure." He said.

I tried to understand what he had said. "What do you mean?" I asked.

"Well a lot of what she wrote is kind of inline with symptoms of some sort of psychosis but it only started a few weeks ago, so they think it was acute, meaning sudden and I guess unexpected. Like the pareidolia thing doesn't even show up until about two weeks ago." He said.

"I don't- what does that even mean?" I asked him.

"Well, now I don't really know a lot about it, but i think its like when you look at a cloud and see a dragon, or those paintings where the faces are made of fruits and food. My understanding is that people have a tendency to see faces and patterns in things. Apparently she had auditory hallucinations and thought there was some sort of plan for her and- well, it wasn't a good plan. I'm sorry again, I don't think any of us can say we know what your going through, but you have our sympathies and our prayers. If there's anything at all we can do for you or you need from us, don't hesitate to ask." He said.

And that was it. He couldn't tell me a lot more because they didn't really know a lot more. I got off the phone and went and laid down. I called my job and told them I didn't know when they'd be back. They said I could take all the time I needed, they would save a spot for me. I haven't ate in three days now. I barely have slept. I've just laid in bed and stared at the ceiling. Occasionally I'll get up to use the bathroom and I'll look at that spot. It's growing and the face is getting clearer. It's laughing at me now. I know it's got a plan for me too but I don't plan to fight it. Let it come, I just want to see my wife again.

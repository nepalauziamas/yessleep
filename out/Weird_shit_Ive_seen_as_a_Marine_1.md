Growing up playing video games and watching war movies, I didn't think twice about joining the Marines so I could be in the infantry. I went through all of the training and unwelcome hardship that makes you *really*  reconsider your decision. Anyway, I got stationed to a desert base known as 29 Palms - the largest piece of militarily controlled land in the US. It covers approximately 930 square miles in total. It's fucking huge, in Southern California, and a few hours from Mexico. When you're out that far, you start to see some shit.

Anyway, fast forward to my first field op and me losing my shit. To put things in perspective as to how far away we are from civilization... the closest man made object is a 3 hour ride away. This day was particularly hot because it broke 130 as if the sun said "I told I could!", so we spent all day hiding under camouflage netting getting classes about various military tactics. Once the sun set, we set off into night to get some hard realistic training done.

At night, we practice using our night vision optic to do simple shit like reloading and reading maps. It produces an image off of ambient infared light so you can actually see a lot more shit than the naked eye. The sky is absolutely cluttered with stars. I can see a shooting star every few seconds. The Milky way. It's pretty darn cool. Finally, after roaming around aimlessly for what felt like forever, we head back and we're granted a few hours of sleep. I lay down and start to drift off.

I'm suddenly woken up after what felt like 10 minutes and I get up instantly.

"Get up bitch, you're on watch."

God dammit.

I get dressed and I stand my post dutifully like I'm told at the checkpoint. I'm given a radio and told to only lift the barbwire after it gets approved over the radio. It's maybe around 2am and everyone else in my company is dead asleep except for myself and an officer in the comm truck. All I can hear are the coyotes. I decide to start looking at the stars with my night vision. I hear a coyote yelp off in the distance and think nothing of it. A few minutes later, another Marine comes over a small hill in front me. Nothing crazy, probably taking a dump. He walks towards me but his eyes don't really reflect light. Rationally, one of us is probably dehydrated so I think nothing of it. He approaches me and after a few seconds of staring at me, he simply says:

"Can I come in?"

His voice didn't sound right. No inflection or questioning tone. Weird. I ask him what his name was and why he was out so far taking a dump. He tells me his name, Sgt Wright, and he ignores my dump question. Same weird voice. Granted, I'm new to the unit so I don't know anyone named Sgt Wright but I still had to verify it.

"Main, this is Roadguard 1. There is a Sgt Wright requesting entry. Over."

"Roadguard 1, this is Main. There is no Sgt Wright in this company and the closest unit is 25 miles away. Make sure- shit get the fuck back here right now. Don't let him or even look at him. Run.."

As the weird dude started to hear this, his face changed to severely angry. Like he wanted to rip my throat out and drink my blood. By the time I got back, everyone is awake. All of the vehicle lights are turned on and everyone is packing up. Scrambling into the trucks. We leave a lot of shit behind like the tents, water, and food  and drive the entire 3 hours back. I never got an explanation from anyone but my squad leader who was a simple, backwoods kind of guy, who bluntly said that whatever I saw, wasn't asking to get through the gate. I never really understood what he meant by that until I discovered this sub.

More to come. Trying to do these in chronological order as fast as I can. As you can guess, they get crazier as they go.

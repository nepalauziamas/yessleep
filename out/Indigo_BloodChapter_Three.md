Damn it, damn it, shitshitshit. The blood’s dripping everywhere, my fingers are trembling. Fuck, why did I do this?! Why did I...

Okay, okay, I need to collect myself. I need to write this down. Maybe I can make more sense of it that way. 

So, I’ve been studying the book for the past couple of weeks, and what I’ve learned is quite surprising, to say the least. It took some time, but eventually I was able to keep the information from the book from just surging into my mind as it did the first time. How? Well, let's just say that William of Occam was onto something, because it was quite simple: I just focused on one page at a time. That's how this book works apparently; it's written in this weird language that doesn't have any known roots in others, so it relies on Indigos touching the pages and “absorbing” the information psychically. Think of it as a “psychic Braille”. 

So anyway, here's what I’ve learned: Indigos are capable of a wide variety of mental abilities, and are capable of learning new ones rather quickly. They usually start the way I did: hearing people’s thoughts. Usually, they learn telekinesis soon after, but as I never really practiced it in my youth--and was kind of put off from using my abilities directly since my Grandmother attacked me--I never learned it until now. So that's part of what I’ve been doing: practicing. 

Now that I’ve gotten that out of the way, I should probably explain what’s going on at the moment. As it turns out, I was right in assuming that there were people other than my grandmother after me, and they want the book for some reason or another, and I’m on the run now. If I live long enough, I’ll probably explain some more things I’ve found out about the book and Indigos and so on. Right now, though, I’ll talk about what just happened that prompted me to leave my apartment, and why I’m currently covered in blood. 

So I was practicing with my newly-found powers, trying to test and expand the limits of my mind, if you will. That was when I heard my landlady, a kindly middle-aged woman named Miss Lloyd, knocking on my door asking to be let in. I should have guessed that something was up by her voice; usually she was very lively and cheery for her age, but she sounded rather spacy and aloof this time. I opened the door, and I barely had time to remember that she had mentioned she would be heading out today and would I be a dear and water the plants by her own door before I felt the familiar sense of being lifted by invisible hands. In stepped five extremely ordinary-looking people, three men, two women, all dressed in...well, just everyday clothes, the sort you’d expect to see on any given pedestrian, very nondescript. The one that I took to be the leader, a man wearing khakis and a navy blue sport coat, walked forward, then nodded at one of the women who was focusing on me intently. One detail I took notice of was the fact that they all had the same eye color, a strange, dark blue. I was suddenly pressed to the floor by the invisible hands, and he walked closer and knelt at my level. 

“Jack, isn’t it?” he asked affably as if his compatriot wasn’t currently pinning me to the ground by telekinesis. “I’m Richard, this is Suzanne--” He nodded towards the woman keeping me pinned. “--and these are William, Robert, and Lucy. Sorry to intrude, but you’ve got something we want, so I--” I began to open my mouth to yell at him, the shout for help, but I felt my mouth being clamped shut. “Please don't interrupt or Suzanne will tear your limbs off like a spider’s, starting with your fingers and toes.” As if to emphasize this threat, I suddenly felt pressure on the aforementioned digits, and the woman in question gave a malicious sneer as if she was desperate to do just that whether I made a noise or not.  

“Where was I? Oh, yes. You have something we want. A leather-bound book with the words, ‘Indigo Blood’ on it? Ring any bells? You can speak now, but not too loudly.” Sure enough, I felt the grip on my mouth release, and I spoke as coldly as I could in a futile attempt at hiding the fact that I was scared shitless. “Why bother asking me with words? You could just probe my memories.” Richard chuckled, seemingly amused by the idea. “Sorry, kiddo, but that doesn’t really line up with our goals. See, we need your mind, memories and all, fully intact. A probe would disrupt that. And from our understanding, that wrinkly old bitch Eleanor made certain that you were unable to be read or stitched at a young age.” 

That gave me pause, which Richard noticed, opened his mouth as if to say something, then sighed and said, “We’re getting off the subject. Where’s the book, kid?” There was a gleam of malice behind his eyes, and desperation. He and his crew needed the book. I didn't know why, and I still don't, but that didn't matter. All I cared about was getting out of that apartment building alive. I remembered the incident with my grandmother, the anger I felt at having my mind invaded, and I imagined driving an invisible metal rod into Richard’s head. 

Just as it had happened before, the recipient clutched his head and screamed in agony, and I felt some brief flashes of memory enter my mind. Something I noticed, though, was the fact that the others had identical reactions simultaneously. I didn't have time to think it over, though, as Suzanne’s grip was released, and I booked it for the window leading to the fire escape. Once I had descended the stairs, practically taking them three at a time--a stupid move, given the rain--I found myself in the alley separating my apartment from a derelict factory. As I was scrambling towards the parking lot, though, I suddenly felt someone grab me from behind, apparently “Robert”. I struggled and kicked, and he lifted one arm, his hand poised to cover my eyes. 

It only took a moment, but I focused my mind on the hand, on getting it away from me. There was a sound of skin, muscle, and bone being torn, and the feeling of blood splashing over me, followed by him releasing me. In the briefest of glimpses, I saw him stagger back as I ran, his hand now separated from his body, and him looking at it in mild annoyance, no pain, no shock whatsoever.

I got into my car, reaching beneath the folded backseat. Good, the book was still there. Before they could round the corner, I gunned the engine and peeled out of the parking spot. 

I’m now seated in my grandfather's home, the one place I doubt they’d ever look. Still, I’m not taking any chances; I’ve been able to track their movements with the book’s chronicling of Indigos, and that's how I’ve determined that this was the best place. They’ve fanned out in multiple directions, but never once came near this place. 

Fuck, I’m so confused, shocked. I have so many questions. Who were they? Why did they hate my grandmother? I can see why they wanted the book, but where do it, her, and those five link together. Maybe a look at the memories of the group will shed some light on the situation.

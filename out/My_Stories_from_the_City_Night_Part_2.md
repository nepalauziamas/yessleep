Many months later a story in the newspaper caught my attention, someone reported finding different parts of human bodies in the city landfill. In this city that wasn't much of a news anymore but there was something that was barely mentioned that made me want to look more into this, the parts belonged to children. I have heard this type of stories all my life, I'm sure most people have about the illicit market behind child kidnapping, they were used to extract their organs, they were sold to child trafficking gangs, they were sold to rich couples that couldn't conceive and I'm sure all of this is true but this was different, the newspaper did not offer clear pictures of the landfill findings but I was able to search for more pictures on a freelance journalist blog, you could see that there where all type of parts, arms, legs, torsos, sometimes you could see all parts of the same body.

I went to the landfill for several days trying to get any information from trash scavengers but no one was willing to talk to me. As soon as I asked about the bodies they would immediately stop talking and move away. I suspected this could happen in other cities close to the landfills so I visited them too without any luck. I continued visiting for weeks. If I couldn't get any information at least I wanted to check if there were more bodies so I went there and dug through the garbage everyday.

One rainy morning while digging I heard this loud scream from one of the scavengers and I could hear the word “Kids” shouted which made me run where she was, I climb and fell down on the mountains of trash and water until I got there before anyone else, she was standing up crying and she just said to me “I touched them!”, when I look down there it was a small leg with the foot cut down, I was in shock but I tried to remain calm, more people gathered around, I started searching on the trash surrounding it maybe I could find something that might help me localize where this was happening but because of the rain most trash was just a mush by now.

The girl that was crying started saying that this just keeps happening over and over, I asked her if she knew who was doing this and she hesitated to say anything people around already started to move away from us like they didn't want anything to do with our conversation, someone else a tall man came back to her and grab her by the arm and pulled her away he turned back and just said “They come from the castle that is everything I know”, that didn't mean anything to me, we are in the city there are no ancient castles in here.When I was about to leave I stepped into some red vegetable and fell down again and there bellow me was my first clue that I didn't notice before there was a huge amount of tomatoes in this area of the trash landfill.

I started visiting the central market in the city where you can find most of the fruit and vegetable trade and after some days I was able to identify the farmer group that had this type of tomatoes, you could see the wrappers all around the floor and they matched with this particular group. I followed the trucks multiple times until one afternoon I followed one to the outside of the city where many farms were located. I kept driving through the farms and small towns trying to find anything that could mean “The Castle” without any luck, there weren't much houses around the only ones where very small houses nothing that could be compared to a castle, I asked around but nobody would talk to me people would just ignore me or asked me to leave them alone, because of the faces they put when I asked the questions I could definitely see that they knew what I was talking about.

I remember it started raining that afternoon very light rain, it was getting dark outside and I walked out of the car to ask questions but I got no luck, when I went back to my car I couldn't find it, it was stolen, I figured out there could be a bus or something that could take me back to the city, I asked around but everyone mentioned that there was nothing until the next day, also the nearest hotel was in the next town, I started walking quickly trying to get there before it got dark I will deal with the stolen rental car later, I walked outside of town and around 5 miles straight I should see the start of the next town, there was only one road but was not paved, all dirt and now with the rain I was just walking on mud.

After what it felt like an hour I sat down on a big stone at the side of the road trying to get some rest and just by luck I turned to my left and I could see just far far away a house on top of a hill.

Could this be what they meant by “The Castle”?

There was smoke coming out from a chimney so there was definitely someone there, out of curiosity I walked in that direction the closer I got I could now see how this was far away from being a castle it was more like a 1 floor 2 bedroom medium house, the materials did not look new it was like it was just built for a moment with any materials they could gather, and when I was close enough it just happened, I heard screams, screams of children asking for help so I started to run up the hill.

It took me 1 hour to get to the top and it was now completely dark outside, there was no other house around I could see.

There was no door just an entrance and there was wood been burned I could tell by the smell inside the house, because of the fire the house look red on the inside, I could hear noises, steps, breathing coming from one closer room and in a more far away place I could hear a more masculine voice chanting something in a language I couldn't understand, I entered the first room and there they where the room full of children they looked at me in horror, they didn't made any sound but ran to the other side of the room to take cover, I didn't know what to do so I just made a sign to them to stay calm and that I will be right back I knew what was happening now I look around the room for something to attack or defend me and found this big wood stick, it looked like it had been a wood chair leg.

I took it and exited the room, slowly I continued walking where the chanting was happening I didn't knew at this point if there was only one person in there or many, I got close enough to see him kneeling down holding something in his hands, it was all red, blood on his hands, on the floor, on his body and the dead body in front of him,it was just him in the house.

I wanted to leave I could go and get the police but I stopped thinking of the children in the room.

I did not want to look anymore so I just acted, I ran at him to hit him but when I got closer he was able to hear me, he turned around and ducked my hit I still was on top of him but he had his hands on my hands and I couldn't move to make any hit, he pushed me and went for a big knife next to him, I knew at that moment that if he took the knife I couldn't do anything anymore so I reacted quick enough and manage to regain my balance, as soon as his hands where on the knife without thinking about it I landed my first hit on his head followed by another and then another I had never hit anyone directly with this force, I could feel how his skull was disintegrating with any new hit, blood started to come out of his head and he just dropped on the floor, I knew he was dead by then, I stood up and recover my breath, a kid was dead next to him, the fire was at the center of the room, in the front wall there seem to be a drawing of something, if I had to describe it I would say it looked like one of those simple drawings of demons, drawing that could come from the Keys Of Solomon book or something like that.

I then saw that the person I killed had no feet, both of his feet were gone. Who was he and who was bringing the children here?, I went to the room to rescue the children but the room was empty there was no one in that room anymore, I was very vigilant looking if someone else was going up to the hill but no one came,I realized this had nothing to do with my investigation since there was no line from here to the landfill, I went down to the nearest town and called the police, the police and reporters arrived and asked me questions and they took the body of the kid.

Next day I naively expected this to be in every major newspaper but not one mention of this anywhere.

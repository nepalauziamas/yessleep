There’s nothing like waking up to the reality that your fiancés family is the spawn of Satan and I am now picking out my wedding dress in the funeral section of a JC Penny. Never would I have imagined that this would be the life I would live but I did tell myself I would fight back, how was the question. 

“Why didn’t you tell me your father was the devil, Zack?” 

“Would you have believed me?”, he said.

He had a point, I’d probably think he was crazy if he told me that. 

“Zack, as much as I love you, I can’t marry you like this, you understand right?”

“Yes, of course I do, this is just part of my dads plan”.

“What plan?”, I asked. 

“My dad was once the ruler of Hell and as a punishment by the other Gods he was sentenced to Earth to live an eternity. The only way he can get himself back to Hell was by starting a family and having his first born son get married, once that happens he will return back to Hell and rule again.”

It sounded simple, explains why he was forcing this marriage. 

“The lesson was for him to learn values, loyalty, sacrifice and unconditional love but obviously after meeting him I’m sure you know he hasn’t. He is filled with anger and rage and wants to go back to Hell and once he does he will bring He’ll on to this Earth and destroy it.”

I couldn’t believe this but after witnessing what I saw last night anything was possible. 

“We can’t let this happen Zack, we need to stop your father”, I told him looking disappointed. 

“How are we going to stop him?”, I asked him. 

“Demons cannot be killed but there might so some other way we can stop his plan”, said Zack thinking.

I was very upset at Zack. Why me? I kept asking myself. Out of all the girls in the entire world I would be the devils daughter in law. Wasn’t a compliment by any means. It still didn’t change the fact that Zack was nothing like his father. Zack is kind and generous, I’m sure it was the mother upbringing that did a good job on her part to raise Zack to be…a good person. Maybe it was fate, fate could say that I was suppose to meet Zack and try and stop the apocalypse from happening but that remains to be seen. 

I still remember the day we met. We ran into each other three times in college all on that same day, I was actually the one who approached him, asking if I can borrow his math book and I’d bring it back, we’ll wouldn’t you know he actually lived right in front of my apartment number 637. He came knocking on my door that night and wanted his book back. We ended up ordering pizza and solving math problems together, he was very good with numbers, laughing all night talking about ridiculous conspiracy theories. It wasn’t until he left with his math book that he pointed out something odd yet romantic, he told me..

“Your apartment number 637, do you know what it means”

“I’m dumb as a box of rocks so obviously I pretended to know and I told him some stupid response”

“He laughed and told me it actually represents “always and forever ”. I was a bit confused at first thinking I wouldn’t want to live in this apartment always and forever but the way he said felt genuine as if he was foreshadowing our relationship also like he was falling in love with me, telling me that both of us would be “always and forever ”. That’s when I knew that he was much more than a neighbor who ironically lived in apartment number 666. I guess you can say this is all my fault then, falling for the devils son charm. 

“I might know of a person who can help you”, a voice spoke. It was one of the JC penny employees. She was tall with long hair, looked like a witch really. 

“I once went to this lady on 23rd who helped me get my husband back using black magic, I was over hearing your conversation and I was wanting to help you two.”

Were we really that loud? I don’t want people thinking we are crazy. 

“What’s her name? I asked. 

“Her name is Lulu, she can help you out, I can assure young lady”. 

We needed all the help we can get, if it meant going to a witch for help. We got the directions and headed that way. 

We arrived at a terribly old run down home that looked abandoned, there were cats everywhere of all colors. Me and Zack knocked on the door. A short old women answered, I’m presuming it was Lulu. 

“Yea, what do you want?” She coughed out. Her cough sounded chronic. 

“Hello lulu, we were referred by a friend of yours, she works at JC PENNY”, I said. 

“Ah I don’t take new clients, get off my property”, she yelled out and coughed out a lung while she was it. 

I pulled out a 100 dollars from my purse and begged her to help. 

“Please, we really need your help so we can prevent the apocalypse from happening.”

She snatched the bill from my hand before I can even say another word. 

“Fine (cough) come in.” She said. 

Me and Zack both walked inside and well from the looks of things you can tell this woman has a dark history.

There were status of gargoyles all around the house with a large cabinet filled with dead stuffed cats that would make a taxidermist jealous. The walls were peeling with mold present. We all entered a room with a large black curtain as the entrance and sat in a chair, she pulled out a deck of cards, looked like she was going to give us a tarot card reading. 

“We are not here for that”

“I know why your here”, she said. 

“You do?”

“Yes, these cards that I am placing on the table will give us the options we have as to what we can do to resolve your issue.”

She finishes with the cards and takes a good look at each one. 

“We are dealing with a very powerful demon, he is no fool to games, he will be hard to defeat, I have seen all options available and each one fails.”

“There is nothing we can do to prevent this from happening?”, I asked. 

“I’m afraid we will have to take matters into our own hands to defeat this demon. I want both of you to look into my mirror”

We both turned to look at a large mirror that was right beside us that was mounted on the wall with a large vintage frame. 

What are we suppose to look at. 

Suddenly I saw someone’s face in the corner of the mirror. I swung back scared, the creature looked hideous. Several more faces appeared inside the mirror. 

“What are those?”

“Those are all demons you see, each one trapped in my mirror after wrecking some havoc on Earth. I use their power for each one of my spells that require more “black magic”. The only way I was able to trap them was with this dagger”

She pulls out a long sharp dagger from under a spell book. 

“When the demon least expects you must stab it in the heart, then you take a mirror and place it right in front of it to trap the demon inside. Before you stab it you must cleanse the dagger with holy water to burn in an entery for the demon to be released.” 

From the sound of it I knew this would be difficult but we had to try. 

“Was this one the options you saw in your card?”, I asked. 

“Yes, it failed. It will know what you are trying to do and it will stop you before it can happen. You must find a way to trick the demon”

I turned to look at Zack. 

“Is there a way we can trick your father?”

“I think so”

“Do not say it, just do it”, the lady coughed out with a hanker chef filled with blood from her coughs. 

Well he had no choice but to try and kill Zack’s father but we had to come up with a plan quick and outsmart the devil himself, the man forcefully insisted to have the wedding tonight. Well time to get ready to have a fucking after party because we sure were going to need it. Time to kill a demon.

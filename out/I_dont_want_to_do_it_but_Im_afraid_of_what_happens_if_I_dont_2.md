June 12th 2007. I remember it well.

I woke up soaking wet on the basement floor. The room had a lingering scent of rotting, water logged flesh and I could hear the water dripping from the pipes into the cistern. I sat up slowly, I wasn't sure if he was still there.

I started thinking back about what had happened, was he real? Did that actually happen? Those were the kinds of questions I was asking myself while I sat there dripping wet and confused. I was under a lot of stress at the time with the divorce and the whole community thinking I was a murder. Maybe I made it all up or I had fallen and hit my head. I tried to convince myself that it was a dream. But the water running down my face was a clear reminder that it wasn't. 

Then I slowly realized that I wasn't afraid. After seeing what I seen one would assume some sort of shock or fear would be a normal response. But for some reason I felt more comfortable than ever, I felt protected and at home.

I slowly stood up and started making my way towards the well. Each step felt like an eternity. I wanted to know, I *needed* to know what was in that well. My feet felt like cinder blocks as I made my way towards the century old stone well. It was in the back corner of the basement, under the kitchen. Probably two or three feet in diameter, maybe more, I'm bad at estimating. I must have stood at the threshold for an hour before I was brave enough to look down.

It was a ten foot drop to the waterline. It was too dark to see into the water, but staring into the well brought this overwhelming feeling of comfort and warmth in the otherwise cool, damp basement. The water had a sort of hypnotic shimmer, the little bits of light that made it into the well seemed as if they were trapped and danced around the rocks and gave movement to still water.

That's when I realized. Maybe whatever is in that well isn't bad. Maybe if I help him, he will help me. I'm not one to believe in magic or ghosts or any of that paranormal stuff, but I saw what I saw and whatever he was he could have killed me if he wanted to. But there I was, alive and looking into the well.

Somehow I knew what I had to do. He needed to feed, and it was my job to bring him a meal.

Everything from that point on was robotic. I went upstairs and changed, found my truck keys and headed towards the local butcher. Half ways to the butchers I realized that buying a full pig when the whole town think I'm some sort of sick serial killer might not be the best idea. I couldn't buy a gun, I didn't have a license and one of the first questions they ask you is if you've been divorced recently. I needed a way to bring him a human sized meal without raising any red flags around town.

The clarity was incredible. Before I even realized what I was doing I was on the highway, I was heading towards the next town where I knew I could buy a hunting bow without a license and without anyone knowing who I am.

It was around then when I realized time was, different. The hour long drive felt instant, I don't really remember being in the hunting store and before I knew it I was back home learning how to use a compound bow.

I set up a target, took a fifty steps back and just like that. Bullseye. I did it over and over, it didn't feel like I was moving my hands or fingers. My vision was crisp and clear and I was laser focused on the task at hand. Was it luck? Or was he truthful when he said he could give me powers beyond anything I could imagine and this was just a taste. I don't know.

That night I didn't sleep. I was restless and alert, every time I closed my eyes I saw the well and the lights dancing on the water. If I let myself drift off I could hear whispers and sounds but I wasn't able to understand the words. At four in the morning I realized I couldn't sleep and I knew what I had to do, I had to bring him a meal. He would let me sleep if I upheld my end of the bargain.

I took my bow and walked out of the house towards the trail into the woods at the back of my property. Deer were common, and people sized, seeing that's what he had been feeding on I figured it would be a good start.

I had never been hunting before, but I must be a fast learner because I blacked out as soon as I seen a doe resting in some tall grass near the tree line. I have some shaky memories of dragging the deer back to the house and into the basement. Some how getting it up and into the cistern. When I realized what was going on I was sitting on the basement floor covered in dirt and deer blood.

All I could do then was wait.

I had lost track of time and I couldn't understand the numbers on my watch. I knew it was the time but the shapes didn't have meaning anymore. I was tired, but I didn't want to leave. I desperately wanted to meet him again. I had questions, and I knew he had answers. My eyes started to get heavy and I was drifting in and out of consciousness when I heard the sound of running water and splashing from the well.

I couldn't move, it was like sleep paralysis. I watched as he emerged from the well, the same twitchy movements. The same eyeless sockets surveying the room.

The bones protruding from this arms clicked on the cistern walls as he evaluated the offering I had brought him. His spine stuck out from the skin on his back and had spike like protrusions that would move in and out as hunched over or stood up. The muscles in the backs of his thighs were mostly exposed and his legs were small compared to the rest of his misshapen body.  He then turned his attention to me.

I could hear his voice inside my head,

"This will do for the time, but you have more to learn if we are to make this arrangement permeate. The flesh satiates my hunger but the essence of life is what fuels my power. You will learn in time my child. So willing, you will make me proud. When the time is right you will bring me my next meal. You will know, do not worry. When the time is right, you will know. 

Rest my child, you will need strength."

Laying motionless on the floor I could hear him snapping bones and tearing meat from the carcass. 

He sounded happy, and that brought me joy. I don't know how long I was asleep after that, but it was the most peaceful rest I ever had. I had an overwhelming feeling that I had found purpose in life.

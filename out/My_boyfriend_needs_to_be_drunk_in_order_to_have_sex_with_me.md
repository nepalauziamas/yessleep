I was confident in the believability, efficacy, seamlessness—whatever you'd like to call it—of my transition. After all, I’d obtained a boyfriend; a normal guy, not some weird fetishist who only wanted me for one reason.

We dated for three months before doing anything sexual. I'm sure with a normal girl he would've done something much sooner. He was aware of my unique situation from the start, and while he had never been with someone like me, he assured me that it wasn’t an issue—that the connection he felt with me was more important than any sexual complications that could arise.

On the day we had sex for the first time, he was understandably hesitant when the clothes came off. I was as well; despite the confidence I had felt, and his many passionate assurances, I was suddenly nervous; self-conscious about my ability to provide an experience that was enjoyable for him.

Things started off fine enough; he began as he would with any other girl, but things quickly became awkward when the differences were finally addressed. He moved away, promised that he just needed a moment to “shift gears.” I waited, trying to appear as casually attractive as possible, while downplaying that aspect of me with which he was unfamiliar.

I was surprised, even a bit hurt, when he reached over to his bedside table, took from it a half-full bottle of whiskey, and chugged the contents. 
He returned to the moment at hand, and we quickly went to making love in what felt like a natural—albeit sloppy—manner.

We continued to have sex in this manner six more times. After the second time—during which he again tried first without liquid confidence—he started drinking before I even arrived. By the time the clothes were off, he would be well under the effects of the booze. The subsequent sex was always enjoyable for me, and seemed to be the same for him, but I couldn’t help feeling insulted; his intoxicant-assisted arousal made me feel ugly, unworthy.

Yesterday, I finally confronted him about it. We were planning on having a cozy movie night, no sex planned. Halfway through, I tried to play, but he was plainly not in the mood. I asked if he found me attractive, and he said that he did. He must’ve seen the disbelief in my eyes, because he got up and went to his dresser, where a bottle of rum sat. I protested, saying that I wanted to be with him while he was sober—for once.

He looked almost pained, and even glanced at the bottle once more; but, begrudgingly, he climbed into bed—totally sober.

His movements lacked passion. His thrusts were halfhearted; he never looked me in the eyes; not a single moan escaped his tight lips. I think that he even faked it in the end; the dispassionate grunt and bodily trembling too theatrical.

He rolled off me, looking absolutely disgusted. I started crying, and he made no attempts to console me. He got up from the bed, pulled away the maggots that clung to his flesh, and wiped away the streaks of slime from his belly. He then opened both windows of the bedroom, letting out the miasmal gases.

I eventually composed myself and applied the restorative salves to my perpetually rotting, sex-battered flesh. Once restored to something resembling a living woman, I asked why he had even agreed to date me in the first place, if he couldn't tolerate me as I was.
His response would’ve chilled my blood, if it hadn’t already been cold.

“I was fine with the idea of it, but I guess the reality is too much.”

I left the house, emotionally devastated. I had believed his promises, maybe just because I wanted to; maybe to someone else they would’ve seemed obviously insincere.

Despite the efforts I had taken to transition into a living woman, I guess I'll still always be a corpse to some people.

I went home thinking things had ended there; that the relationship was over, and I would simply be able to move on with my life—however difficult it may be. But that’s not the end, and moving on proved much harder than anticipated—but who could anticipate being the target of an assassin?

I won’t waste time going over my death, nor will I detail the means of my resurrection. I am, as far as I'm concerned, a living being. I am conscious, I am aware, I am sentient and humanly intelligent. I may not meet all the usual biological criteria, but existentially, philosophically, I am alive. Cogito Ergo Sum.

Once home, I showered and tended to my body; adjusting and righting the things that had been undone or misaligned during the final tryst with my now ex-boyfriend. After that, I started my nutrient injections; a series of specially-concocted compounds and regenerative solutions that keep my body from undergoing advanced decomposition. 

Necrosis abated, I crawled into bed and closed my eyes, hoping to sleep away the emotional pain. Just as my eyes closed, I heard a faint sound. Having once been interred in abysmal silence, listening for any signs of salvation, my ears had become especially sensitive to noises most people overlook—if they even hear them at all. I sat up in the darkness, turning my head to the auditory source. I had barely managed to identify the specific direction when something burst forth from my closet.
The moon outside my window offered only a thin ray of light into the room. In their lunge, the figure hadn’t been illuminated; had purposely avoided it to escape identification. Before I could even get up, hands were around my throat.

There was nothing I could do. The person strangling me was too strong; there was no hope of overpowering them. They silently choked me, expressing nothing but cold, merciless determination. Even if the entire room had been illuminated I still wouldn’t have been able to identify them—there was nothing but a surface of black where their face should be. Some sort of mask concealed everything, yet still somehow allowed them to see.

The terror of the moment brought back dreadful flashes of my first death, causing my body to weaken further as my mind suffered against the present fright and remembered trauma.

I was dead within seconds. Once satisfied with my demise, they adjusted some things throughout the room—probably removing evidence of their presence—then left. I waited another ten minutes, then got up from the bed. I rubbed my neck, and flakes of dead flesh came away on my palms. I went to my bathroom, grabbed my restorative salves, and applied them while I reflected on what had just happened.

I had no idea how long they had been in the house, but they apparently hadn’t known about my condition; otherwise, they would’ve done something far worse, something from which I probably wouldn’t have come back. Elated at their ignorance, and no longer tired—thanks to whatever remnants of adrenaline were left in my body—I got up and decided to do something unusual; I decided to call my ex, and see if he would be willing to work things out.

Facing and cheating death a second time really put things into perspective for me, and I realized that intercourse was merely one aspect of a relationship; an aspect that I wasn’t even that crazy about. Intimacy can be expressed in other ways, and he and I had been happy outside of it.

I started to call him, but was interrupted mid-dial by a sound outside my window. It was the voice of a man, speaking softly. Had I been a normal woman, I wouldn’t have heard it.

“Yeah, it’s done. I'm still at the house; had to duck into the bushes cause of some lady across the street coming out to have a smoke break. Didn’t want her to see me leaving….Yeah…send the payment to the account I gave you….Yeah, I’m sure she’s dead, I think I know how to do my fuc….yeah, yeah, alright…Listen, I don’t need to hear your justifications. You wanted your girl dead, and she’s dead. Just send over my money.”

The call ended, and a few moments later the rustling of leaves indicated the departure of the hitman.
His words, specifically one sentence, echoed in my brain: “You wanted your girl dead, and she’s dead.”
My boyfriend, my ex-boyfriend, had hired someone to kill me. Fortunately, in his ignorance regarding the proper method of my destruction, he hadn’t hired someone appropriate for the job.

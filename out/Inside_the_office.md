I don’t know who this will reach or if I’ll reach anyone. My name is Matthew I’m Male 26 and I work in a small office. It all seemed normal at first with the occasional nut job worker that you want nothing to do with. The endless smell of decaying meat all started the Friday of last week.

 

It was the end of the evening shift and most of us were exhausted and eager to leave. When I cleaned my desk and signed off of my work computer I started for the door. To my surprise, the walk felt longer than normal but I caulked it up to my tired imagination.

&#x200B;

5 minutes later I noticed I was exactly where I started. Puzzled I looked around to see no one around me there was this god-awful stench like rotting meat. I tried to call the front desk to no avail.

&#x200B;

I decided to check the windows to see if I can shout for someone \*being only on the 4th floor\*. When I finally got to the window the view was almost like a void. It was endless the building seemed to have risen 100’s of stories. When I turned the office was noticeably bigger.

&#x200B;

The walls have this gooey liquid dripping out of them, almost like a waterfall made from slime. The walls seem almost flesh-like, almost as if it's alive. It feels soft and warm to the touch. And then that's when I saw it.

&#x200B;

It was this tall maybe 7-foot boney humanoid creature. Its joints bent backward and its head was at an uncomfortable unhuman angle. It made a noise almost like a baby lost crying for its mother. But if you were to put a shitty voice modifier over it.

&#x200B;

I hid scared of what it would do to me if it caught me. Almost like encountering a starved lion in the wild. Nights are the hardest the hunger and thirst almost make it impossible to sleep and when I was finally able to sleep through my starvation, I would awake to the sound of my stomach that almost sounded like it was screaming in pain. 

&#x200B;

My mouth was so dry that the meaty-smelling humidity almost felt like it could quench my thirst. The walls seemed to decay more and more every day as if I was inside a corpse. The smell is ungodly like someone was stockpiling roadkill inside a freezer left out in the sun. I'm currently locked inside one of the higher-up's rooms scared the THING will see me.

&#x200B;

It's day 4, and already the liquid dripping from the walls looks more thirst-quenching as each day goes on. I think on day 5 if there's no hope I'm going to do it, I'm going to drink the sludge. It's my only chance of survival right?? I can't just die of dehydration.

It's the 5th day, I'm still sitting in the room, phones still having no service, I've given up all hope of being rescued from this hell hole. I did it I drank the liquid It has consistency and spoiled milk with a crimson taste. I almost threw my stomach acid from the texture alone I feel hydrated at least.

&#x200B;

It's now day 6, I'm in so much pain my stomach feels as if a lactose intolerant person ate and drank dairy for the whole day. I can't leave the room to relieve myself I hear them gather outside the door, I hear their taps in the middle of the night. My joints are starting to ache I hear their teeth chatter as if they're calling for me, I'm contemplating suicide.

&#x200B;

Day 7, It hurts my body is in so much pain I'm craving it, I'm craving the sludge I want more. I need more I keep drinking it I have stains all over my shirt from it. My arms and legs ache I can't walk anymore I have to crawl. My knees and arms feel like a constant sensation of being pulled I need more sludged. 

&#x200B;

On day 8, I no longer crave the sludge. My limbs have gotten noticeably longer and my knees almost seem as if they bend inwards. The little meat on my body is starting to peel off my skin like a cancer patient's hair through chemo. 

&#x200B;

On day 9, I tasted it... My own meat, tasted amazing I need more I keep ripping my own flesh off my bone oh god... I'm starting the become one of them. I'm starting to lose the ability to think rationally I think I'm ready to meet them I hear them crying for me.

&#x200B;

On day 10, I'm no longer lonely I opened the door and they welcomed me with a chattering of their teeth. I no longer have to need to be rescued for I have been found by my new friends. Goodbye.

Did I encounter a Ghost?

As a kid I was very scared of the dark, this fear was disregarded most of the time until I couldnt sleep anymore because of it. My Mum wouldnt let me keep the light on but gave me a Plasma Ball (those ones where when you put your hand on it all the Plasma concentrates its energy on that spot). It didnt light up much, but it was comforting. My cat Willow, always slept on my bed- she was heavily attached to me and was never an aggresive cat. One night, Willows head suddenly shoots up and she looks directly towards the Plasma Ball. It was a little odd but nothing too out of the blue, that was until she started growling under her breath. I tried stroking her but she just wasnt moving, suddenly her back arched and she started hissing loudly, backing away and hiding behind me whilst hissing. I then look over at the Plasma Ball, all the Plasma Energy was focused on one spot as if there was a hand on it. I quickly covered me and Willow under the bed cover and she snuggled into me, I fell asleep eventually and my Mum convinced me it was just a dream even though she watches Ghost Adventures daily. It never happened again after this and I never had anymore spooky encounters in that apartment. My Mum did tell me that the old lady who lived there before said 'if she ever haunted a place, it would be this apartment becuase she loved it so much'. Maybe it was her? It didnt seem aggresive, or unfriendly. As far as I remember there was no bad energy just pure fear from the paranormal experience, seeming as I was a little girl who grew up watching Doctor Who, Ghost Adventures and many Supernatural TV Shows and movies- I got paranoid very often, especially when it came to Hotel Minotaurs, Mansion Lurking Werewolves and Moving Statues. All of which were in Doctor Who. So, did I encounter a Ghost?

(My family has had a history with paranormal activity, so instead of rambling about my story to the point it's boring, I'll tell you about my Grandfathers Ghost story that I dont remember very well but I know enough.

So, when my Grandfather came out of Prison he began working for a 'Palace' In England, I wont name what one specifically. He was security and worked very long nights and days. One night shift he was working, guarding a certain room in said Palace incase anyone intruded, I dont know much about this room in particular other than it belonged to a women who killed herself in the pond that bordered the Palace. My Grandad said you could constantly hear dripping in the Palace, especially within this area and especially at night. People thought it was just a leak hence why there was always a 'wet floor' sign, because every morning a wet patch appeared in a certain part of the Palace near the womens room where my Grandad guarded. One night, he saw a women in the distance of the stretched hallway. He told her she couldnt be here, but at first she didnt respond he repeated himself and this time she turned to look at him and said. "Why? This is my home." And disappeared. He tried looking around for her but no luck, and when he returned the bedroom door was open. He looked around the room but there was nothing. He reported this as his shift ended, only to be told a few hours after that the Palace had been flooded and that he wouldnt be required to work until renovations were done. Till this day this story still plays on his mind).

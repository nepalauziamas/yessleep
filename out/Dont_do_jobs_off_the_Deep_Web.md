This all started a week ago, when I lost my job and was running behind on bills. I lived in a simple house, and that job was all that held my life together.

After a night of drinking and watching TV, I started looking for a new job. Most of them looked boring, just 9 to 5 office jobs, but one caught my eye, it was an ad to the side of the screen that read, *"High paying jobs for hire! This isn't just your normal 9 to 5 job!"*

In desperation, I clicked on the shady ad. Slowly but surely a new website loads, with multiple links to different jobs with different descriptions. *Deep Web Jobs.*


***House Sitting***

**$100 per shift, Stay in a camera room, watch all rooms, keep the house safe. Rules in link.**


*Seems easy.* I thought to my self, god do I regret that. 


***Crop Harvest***

**$150 per field, Harvest a field of corn. Tools are provided. Rules in link.**


Reading down all the jobs, the house sitting seemed the easiest so I clicked on the link, eager for the $100.

On the screen, a sign up sheet popped up, asking for my email. I typed it in quickly and was met with the message, *We hope to see you soon!* Satisfied with that, I hopped in bed and turned off the lights. 

I start to drift off, when I hear a buzz from my phone, irritated, I get up and check my phone. *a new email?* I thought to myself, I clicked on the notification.


**Your Application Has Been Accepted!**

*Thank you for applying to the house sitting job, you will stay at the house from 12am until 4am, and you must follow these rules. Your money will arrive at 6am after your shift.*

I must've read that email 10 times over, thinking this was a prank or something, *no way do I actually have to follow these crazy rules.* I thought to myself, entranced at how specific the rules were. I put my phone back down to charge, and went to sleep, still confused by that email.

All I could do the next day was think about what that email said. Man in the living room, woman in the kitchen, conversation with a person in the window, it all seemed too crazy to be true, but i couldnt help but to find myself 15 minutes before 12, with an old ipod in my pocket, standing at 471 Petterson Drive.

I entered the house, it had a sort of old but still livable vibe to it, the house was dusty but the kitchen and living room were spotless. I made my way upstairs and at the end of a long hallway, stood the camera room, it was barren and small, with nothing but a chair, a camera monitor, and a couple windows in it. I sat down in the chair, *man I hope this is worth it.* 

It wasn't. 

Looking at the computers clock, its 12:03, I have one hour to look around the house. First I head back to the living room, close blinds, lock doors, and turned lights off, repeat that for all rooms and at 12:56 I was back to the camera room.

As soon as it hit 1:00 I felt a sudden dread, telling me to get up and leave right now, I turned on all the cameras and, on the back of my neck, it felt as if a feather was resting on it. 

I froze, *keep calm Chris, keep calm.* I closed my eyes as I remembered the rules. It felt like hours, that feather tickling the back of my neck, but I held out, not moving and keeping my eyes closed. The feather went away.

I opened my eyes, relieved, and heard behind me slow, coordinated footsteps. I whipped around, the footsteps went away, and a slow chuckle came from the camera speaker.

The man was watching TV.

The TV was lit up with some cooking show, and the man was chuckling while watching the show, I turned that camera off, and hoped I had done it fast enough. The sound from the TV echoed up the stairs, chilling me to the bone. *"What the hell is this place!"* I thought to myself, feeling queasy. *"and how is it only 1:20!"*

The next 20 minutes were creepy as can be, unknown sounds bounced around the house, the man laughing at the TV, Watching all the cameras, until the silence hit me hard. The TV had been turned off, and dread had fell upon me again, the noise from the TV had been a constant for the past 20 minutes but now that it was off, the silence felt threatening. I slowly turned on the camera and found the room to be empty. I sighed in relief.

For what felt like an eternity, my eyes darted around the cameras, on edge, until the clock made a quiet beep, and it turned 2:00, I rose from my chair and opened the blinds revealing the pitch black lawn outside, I sat back down as the clanging of pots and pans ringed in my ears. I looked down at the blue button beside the monitor, then at the lady, now cooking black eggs in the kitchen and as I was about to press the button, 

*"Hi Chris."* A womans voice came from the window, I froze glueing my eyes to the moniter, forcing myself not to look at the window. 

"H- hi, how was y- your day?" My voice was shaky, it was obvious that I was scared. 

*"I was just strolling around the neighborhood, saw you were here, and I just wanted to say hi."* the window she was talking to me through was high enough up the ground to need a large ladder to get to. *"how was your day?"*

"My day was, it was f- fine. Thanks." The woman in the kitchen started to get louder.

*"Ok, well I have to go. It was nice to meet you."*

"It was nice to meet you too."

*"Bye."* I wanted to get up, I wanted to just close the blinds and never hear her voice again, but something just told me that I should not get up. *"Wow your a smart one. I thought that would get you. Hmm, maybe next time. Goodbye."* I waited a few seconds, the last thing I want to see was the face of that lady talking to me, so I waited until I was sure she wasnt there anymore, then closed the blinds.

Once that ordeal was over, I realized that the lady in the kitchen was gone, even though I never pressed the button. *Oh no, oh no no no.* I thought, I had broken one of the rules, and it was only 2:30. Now I'm sitting under the desk typing this out on my iPod, and there is a lady with a ragged apron on, walking in circles around the room, I'm scared to make any noise. So please, if you see an ad for *'Dark Web Jobs'*. Don't click it.

Update:

It's 4:30 now, I made it out of the house and I'm safe, my left leg is hurt a little, but I'm getting ahead of myself, let me tell you what happened. 

The lady from the kitchen walked around the room, making soft groans and drooling everywhere. I kept as silent as I could, freezing time she turned in my direction.

A small beep came from on the desk, notifying me that it had turned 3:00. The lady in my room melted into the floorboards, screaming a scream of the upmost agony and pain.

What I was supposed to do at this point was turn on the music on my iPod, close my eyes, and cover my ears, but hiding under the desk, I didn't know if I still had to do that.

I waited and waited and silence was all I could find, until, the walls and floors of the house started to contort. The house shifted and moved into what looked like faces popping out of the walls, the only description of the sound I can think of is a scream of terror itself.

I couldn't take it anymore. My mind told me to get up, to run, to get out as fast as I can. But I knew I couldn't, I closed my eyes, and turned the music on, the screams were drowned out, and it seemed almost calming, but in the back of my mind, I knew what was happening around me.

The music blared loudly, and my eyes stayed glued shut, then, the music turned off. I opened my eyes and the house was normal again. Shakily, I stood up and looked at the clock. 

3:34

I got back under the desk, and lay there, terrified, but nothing happened and I was sitting there for 35 minutes until, the final beep from the clock came, telling me I could finally leave. 

I got up, walked down the hallway, down the stairs, to the front door, and finally, the sweet, cool air of the night hit my face, and in that moment I felt a relief that was almost euphoric.

I walked home, and picked up my phone, but when I went to email Mr. Salazar, his email was gone, the website was gone, and there was no trace of him at all.

I tried to fall asleep, but I couldn't get the faces out of my head. The look they had, can't be explained. I don't know if I'm going to get my money, but at this point, I don't care. I just want to never go back to that house again.

Update: Its 6:00 now, a package somehow appeared at my door, and inside was $80 and a letter, the letter is as follows. 


**You Can't Escape**


*Hello again Chris, I see that you showed up for your shift this morning, I appreciate that, but during your shift, you broke one of the rules, I've taken $20 off of your pay because of that. I'm pretty sure you're already aware, but I can tell, you dont want to go back, most people don't. And I'm here to say, you can't escape. By entering that house, you pretty much signed your soul away, no matter what you do, you will always be at that house by 12.*


*That is all, Sincerely, Mr. Salazar.*

Part 2:

My sleep last night was horrible, I couldn't stop thinking about what happened on my first shift. The whole day I stayed in bed, terrified for midnight to come, but it had to come eventually. 


*11:57*, I begged that nothing would happen to me


*11:58*, I put my iPod in the trash


*11:59*, I lay in bed and close my eyes


I feel pressure on my feet, and my soft bed disappears from under me. I open my eyes and find myself inside that cursed house again, with my iPod, and a printed paper of the rules in my hands. *What! How is this possible!* I think to myself. I ran to the door, slamming my fists against it, wanting any way out, but to no avail, I couldn't leave.

I defeatedly walked up the stairs and sat in the camera room chair. I sat there, crying for an hour, until 1 came, and with it, came the man laughing at the TV. I turned the camera off, and continued to sob, not caring about the sounds around me.

But then, I felt a hand wrap around my neck, I froze, closed my eyes, and tried to control myself. The grip closed tighter and tighter until I could barely breathe, then it finally left me alone. I gasped for air, and grabbed the printed paper of rules, given to me at the start of my shift.

I looked at the printed sheet of rules and at the bottom was a handwritten message from Mr. Salazar himself. *'Good Luck'*. I looked back up at the cameras and composed myself. *Ok Chris, you can do this, you've already been here once, pull it together*. 

I listened, not hearing the TV anymore, I turned the camera on and the clock let out a small beep, it had turned 2:00. I stood up to open the blinds but hesitated, did I really want to talk to her again? Regardless, I pushed the thought away, and opened the blinds to be met with a face only insane people would call a woman. It looked as if she hadn't eaten once in her life, her skin looked like it was airtight to her bones and she had no meat in her body, Her smile was literally ear to ear, her skin sagged down at least 2 feet, and her eye sockets had large, black, bloodshot eyes with tiny, beady yellow pupils. 


***"Hello again, Chris"***


I closed the blinds as quickly as I could and went to hide under the desk, but the desk is just a block, no space to hide under, I don't know what to do, I hear slow footsteps coming up the stairs, oh god, the doorknob is turning.

The door is locked, oh thank god I remembered to lock it, she is screeching from behind the door, she's slamming her hands on it, its only a matter of time until she breaks the whole door down. What do I do?

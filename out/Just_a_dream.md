First post, not born an english speeker, be kind <3   


I often dream and I often remember the dreams. It also happens i cant distinguish dream from reality, until i wake, but this is very rare. Once i thought i took my bike to school to do my exams, only to realize the entire morning, bike ride and preparations was a dream, and I in reality only had five minutes to get ready and on my bike, or id be late for the exam. I often have normal dreams, but if my sleep is interruped, im more prone to have wierd dreams, thats feels real, or where i can interact a little. Its not compleete lucid dreaming, i think, but just a little interactive. I also remember them better if my sleep is interrupted. Im also very sensitive to energy drinks. So when my boyfriend and I bought two Monster Energy Drinks at 10 pm, i knew it would affect my sleep. But it was a new flavor and we were curious. As expected i was extremly energetic for the rest of the eventing until we fell asleep at 2-3 am. 

  
At 7 am i found myself awake and unable to sleep. I know it sound odd to blamed the energy drink, but i was still tired but unable to sleep, and laid next to my boyfriend and scrolled for a few hours. Around 10 am i began feeling sleepy, though my boyfriend began to wake up. Im a side-sleeper and i was facing the door to the kitchen then my boyfriend asked if i wanted a cup of tea, and we had a laugh about the amount of loose tealeaves he had used for his cup.   
My boyfriend doesnt drink tea. Slowly but surely i feel something grap my neck from behind. I cant really see it clearly but some kind of black boney fingers. I try to scream at by boyfriend in the kitchen but only a raspy whisper escapes my lips, if any sound at all. I try to tap the walls but i can only reach it slightly with a finger nail, and cant tap hard enough to make a propper distress signal. My breath is short and shallow. I try to scream again, without succes, but get an idea. I dont have long nails, but they are not completly short eigther. So i take my thumb to the creature thats strangling me, and pierce the nail into its flesh. Something is working. It didnt stop, but it was clearly hurt, but instead of stopping, it directed one of its fingers into the muscle between my neck and shoulder. An area im ofted sore in. The pain flood through my upper body, almost like a knife or a lightning strike. A pain ive felt before. My lungs feel almost out of air, and my throut is almost closed shut.   


Thats when i woke up. Now on my back, with my boyfriend next to me, just enjoying the morning. Id like to say its just a bad dream or maybe sleep paralysis. My boyfriend even mentoined he could see me dreaming. Almost like when a dog dreams, makes small movements and makes tiny noises. I guess that was me "screaming for help"

What is nagging me, is the pain i still feel in my shoulder and the knot now in my throat.

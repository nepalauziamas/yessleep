 “So if you can see ghosts,” I asked the woman shellacking my nails, “why are you doing *this* for a living?”

“You try, lady. Put out an ad. See what you get.” Susan, my manicurist snorted. “*I* tried, and I got three calls:  a family of seven who tried to baptize me, a schizo who tried to stab me with a needle, and the guy in the hotel room…well, what he had under his bathrobe might’ve been pretty much invisible, but that didn’t make it a *ghost.*” 

“See you in three weeks?” I asked when she’d finished. 

“Don’t think so.” Susan wrinkled her nose. “No offense, but you’ve got the stink of death about you.” She hesitated. “Either that, or Tiffany microwaved fish for lunch again.” 

I thought things would get better [after a dead guy made my mobster husband disappear](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/us5znx/my_idiot_mobster_husband_killed_the_wrong_guy_now/) and I moved to the Midwest with my son, Ralphie Junior. 

I can’t specify the place, but it’s a town with a dying mall where unhappily married couples go to sip half-price cocktails at Applebee’s, and the hottest action on a Saturday night is cruising the Wal-Mart parking lot with the radio blaring and the windows down.

If you think that narrows it down–well, good luck. 

Right, Ralphie Junior. He’s had some, uh, trouble adjusting to school. And it’s no wonder. You drop one *f-bomb* around here and people act like you just took a shit in their wonderbread-and-mayonaisse sandwich or something.  I mean, the closest thing to an “international community” is *one guy*, from Paris–

Paris, *Kentucky*. 

But what was I saying? Right, Ralphie Junior. The school. Now, Ralphie Junior getting picked on is nothing new. You know, kids can be so cruel, so petty, so prejudiced…and believe me, my little Ralphie deserves every bit of it. The last time I got called in for a parent conference because a kid was *“picking on”* Ralphie, it turned out that the kid hit Ralphie Junior because my sweet little boy took his sandwich at lunch. Every day. For a year. 

I would’ve hit him too. 

What worries me is that Ralpie has made a *friend.* Ryan.

Ralphie Junior won’t shut up about him.

*“Ryan is amazing at hide-and-seek. It’s like he disappears!”*

*“You should have seen how high Ryan jumped today at recess!”*

*“Nobody picks on me when I hang out with Ryan!”*

The way Ralphie Junior was talking, I was imagining this Ryan kid to be, I dunno, some kind of miniature hulk. Picking Ralphie Junior up from school a few days ago, I got a glimpse of him: Ryan looked as thin and weak as gas-station coffee, one of those smudge-faced, puffy-eyed, pale kids who sits in the back and never says anything. 

He was carrying a scuffed-up teddy bear beneath one arm.

Okay, so *that* was weird. But not as weird as our conversation in the car.

“The substitute fell and broke her ankle today!” Ralphie Jr. explained cheerily, as though nothing could have pleased him more. “She shouldn’t have told Ryan to put away his teddy bear. I guess she didn’t know.” 

*Didn’t know what?* I wondered. But I kept my mouth shut, because I knew that Ralpie Jr–just like his dearly departed father–would spill all those secrets he was trying so hard to keep if I just stayed quiet and let him do it. 

“I was thinking,” Ralphie Jr. began–in that same trying-to-be-nonchalant tone my dead husband used to put on just before asking me if he could use my credit card to put a downpayment on a boat or some other sketchy thing– “do you think I could go over to Ryan’s house sometime? Like, today, maybe?”

*The apple didn’t fall from the shit-for-brains tree, it seemed.* I groaned and asked for the address. The truth was I wanted to meet this “Ryan” kid’s parents. Partially to see if they were psychos, and partially to see if that bland little boy happened to have a hot rich single dad. If our kids already got along that was a start, right?

I was still daydreaming about this Midwestern-Surfer-Millionaire-Dad when we pulled into Ryan’s driveway. Early 2000’s brick ranch house. No lights in the windows. The yard was a little small, but I cared more about the master bedroom closet space anyway. Walking up the driveway holding Ralphie Junior’s hand, I wondered if Ryan’s dad and I would like the same wines.

We rang the bell. Twice. No answer. 

“I guess your friend isn’t home,” I sighed. *And his dad isn’t, either.* But as I loosened my grip on Ralphie Jr.’s hand and turned to check on the car, something happened that chilled my blood:

The door of the house flew open and Ralphie Jr.’s fingers slipped through mine. 

By the time I spun back around, it was like the house had swallowed him up.

“Hey!”  I pounded on the locked door. “*Hey!* Ralphael Palumbo Junior, you open this door *RIGHT NOW,* mister! Ryan, you in there? Anybody! *HEY!”* 

Mother’s instincts, I guess, but the thought of what might be happening to my son inside that dark, silent house was driving me crazy. I bruised my shoulder slamming all of my 125 lbs against the door again and again. Maybe only a few minutes had passed, but it felt like hours, I looked around for something to smash a window with–

“Mommy,” Ralphie Junior asked when I turned around again. “Why are you holding a *tree stump?*”

It was a long ride home. Apparently, Ralphie Junior informed me, Ryan *couldn’t* play after all. But at least he’d given Ralphie Junior what he came for! 

That’s when I noticed it: *the teddy bear.* A gray, one-eyed thing with a perpetual frown stitched onto its muzzle, like a sick love-child of Eeyore and Winnie the Pooh. 

I wondered if it had bedbugs. 

“Oh. That’s…*nice.*” I was at a loss for words. “*So* nice. I’m sure Ryan misses it a lot! We better take it right back, hun.” 

“We can’t.” Ralphie explained in a flat, terrified tone I’d never heard him use before–not even when he was looking at an actual *dead guy.* “Ryan says I have to take Chip for a little while…and I don’t want to make Ryan mad.” 

*Chip.* At first the name made me roll my eyes…but then it made me wonder. There *was* a bit of bead missing from the top of *“Chip’s”* single eye. Giving the gray bear a perpetually hateful, downturned look. My son was staring into that broken eye like it was a peephole to the darkness beyond the stars–or something like that. He took the bear to his room the moment he got home. 

I probably should have followed him–but dinner wasn’t made and the dirty clothes were stacked high enough to be an OSHA violation. What can I say? When you’ve got nothing to wear to work tomorrow, the laundry takes priority over diabolical stuffed animals. 

Ralphie Junior's room was dark, the door half-open, when I finally checked on him upstairs.

"Honey…" I shouted, "I cut the crust off of your pepperoni sandwiches…" 

Something dribbled on my cheek. I looked up.

Ralphie junior was dragging himself along the ceiling with his head turned around almost backwards. The teddy bear was clenched in his drooling jaws. I was too terrified to move…but when I opened my mouth, its was my *‘Mother Voice’* that came out instead of a scream.

"Raphael Palumbo Junior, you come down from there *this instant!*"

My son did as he was told, but not in the way I'd imagined.

I knew Ralphie Junior was overweight, but I didn't fully understand how bad it had gotten until he dropped onto my head. 

While Ralphie Junior gurgled in the language of Hell and tried to pull out my eyeballs, I tugged at the teddy bear between his teeth. *It* was clearly the cause of all this–what had made Ryan *'jump high'* and *'hide'* so well. When it finally came free, Ralphie Junior collapsed in an exhausted heap. 

"You're going in the blender, you little shit!" I screamed at the bear in a cocktail of rage and fear..

It didn't like *that* at all. Something rippled like flexing muscles beneath the cloth, and the stuffed arm I was holding got *hot*.

Hot enough to burn. 

I yelped and dropped the flaming teddy bear, which crawled around setting fire to my landlady's carpet. I wondered if this would be covered under my right to bear firearms.

I grabbed one of my dead husband's golf clubs and gave chase, but that tiny bastard was *fast* for his size. A hateful blue glow full of evil intelligence radiated from *"Chip's"* single eye, and with a wave of its paw a dresser flew across the room and nearly smashed my head like a melon.

Next thing I knew I was swinging the golf club like a maniac, playing baseball with my IKEA furniture. I rolled Ralphie Junior out of the way, ducked beneath a flying desk lamp, and gave that little fucker a hole-in-one straight to the jaw.

"FOUR!" I yelled as the possessed bear flew backwards into the hall closet. 

I jammed what was left of my coffee table under the closet door, which had started to vibrate with telekinetic force. A blue glow came from inside. 

Ralphie Junior was unconscious, but at least he was breathing. I had no idea what to do.

So I looked at my phone.

And I thought of Andre. 

My dead mobster husband Ralph had kept all his drug dealer contacts in code in a little black book, which I'd held onto for some reason. Andre had been a part of that world–was it possible that his number might be inside?

I wasn't worried about the code. Ralph had *thought* it was clever, but I'd cracked it halfway through an episode of *Desperate Housewives* years ago. That was how I'd been able to send Sympathy cards to all his mistresses. It took some finding–and the pounding and smoke from upstairs were *really* annoying–but before long I was dialing–and someone picked up.

I kept waiting to hear breathing on the other end of the line–but then I remembered that Andre didn't breathe.

"Andre?" I asked, trying to sound sweet. "Do you remember me?" 

There was no reply but the sound of my heartbeat. And then– 

"Yea."

I wondered what I should say. Something like *"wow, you sound great–it's like you've barely rotted at all?"* I decided the truth was the way to go. 

“I’ve got this possessed stuffed animal. Do you know anybody who might be interested in something like that?” A very long pause.

***“Where is the Trapped One?!”*** The violent,raspy shift in Andre’s voice almost made me drop the phone.

“Uh, my house.” 

“Get out. Then send me the address.”  

“But we *just* moved here!” I whined. 

“The buyer will compensate you.” 

Andre named a figure–

And I decided I didn’t like living in a giant cornfield that much, after all. 

What else can I say? It looks like Ralphie Junior and I are on the road again.

My little brother had always been a strange person, shy reserved and very quiet he didn’t talk to many people our parents included. But I had never seen him this quiet. This all started around a month ago when me and my brother were driving home from school it was super hot, the sun even looked closer and I had just assumed he had a shitty day since we usually talked a bit in the car but he was silent his eyes were dark and his facial expression didn’t falter, he didn’t seem to be blinking either. When we got home he walked silently to his room, his foot steps quiet and unnerving, my parents of course didn’t bat an eye at his strange behavior but I did.
“Welcome home boys” my dad said with a voice so fake it was almost as unnerving as my brothers attitude.
“Hey dad” I sad before I quickly walked up the stairs.
I knocked on my brothers door determined to get to the bottom of this.
“Hey kid open the door what’s going on?” I demanded.
He calmly opened the door his eyes immediately met mine and his expression was lazy it was more like he was staring right through me. He was still silent.
“Hey is something wrong? You can talk to me you know.”
“I’m fine” he responded Cooley a creepy smile like the ones the murders always wear in horror films appeared on his face before he almost robotically turned away from me and walked back into his room. I turned around to head back downstairs when I came face to face with my dads our noses almost touching at the close proximity.
“Holy shit, hey guys” My voice was nervous and high pitched.
“Hi dear” one of my parents responded I couldn’t tell which one though as neither of their mouths seemed to move.
They starred right through me much like my younger brother had just a second before, they weren’t moving and also didn’t seem to be blinking, they looked inhuman from where I was standing. I tried to side step them as their gaze was permanently fixed on me. Something was seriously wrong with my family. They acted the same way for weeks the sun still looked weird and I just tried to ignore it or chalk it up to the smoldering heat, my brother only left his room for school and I don’t think my parents stopped smiling once during that month. After two weeks my brother started too faint after three my parents did too and by the fourth week it had become normal, too normal by the fifth I felt like I was cooking alive and my brother was still wearing all black and my parents were dressed for winter. And soon the same thing was happening to everyone one in town WHAT DAY IS IT EVEN? The clocks all stopped working a week ago. People are mindlessly walking the streets it’s like a Zombie apocalypse my brother is sitting motionless on the couch his eyes are black the whole eye his eyes used to be green, my parents they’re no where to be found my brother won’t wake up I don’t know what’s happening to this town, but my god the sun looks a whole lot closer than it used to be.

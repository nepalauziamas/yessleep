Hello, i'm Laura(F20) and i have a litlle cousin, who we'll call L(5), a aunt, who we’ll call “Aunt”, and a uncle who we’ll call “Uncle” we lived very happilly and everything was right, until everything started to go wrong. L lived with her mother (Aunt) and with her father (Uncle), Uncle's relationship with Aunt was always very rocky, they would fight a lot and none of them where right, they where at the verge of divorcing and Uncle already had the papers ready, he planned to take custody of L because he thought Aunt was a “crazy woman” and “he would never let L close to Aunt again”. L was devastaded after her father dissapeard, She started telling me how she misses him, that he won’t “leave the basement“, stories about how "Daddy and Mommy screamed a each other in the basement", or how "Mommy left Daddy alone” i have been worried since, they fought for the last time, he disappeard since that day and there was no trace of him, until now. L stated telling the storie on how Uncle was always working and sleeping on the basement and that her mother (Aunt) said she was not supposed to go there or she might "disturb him", i always thought she was creating all of these stories because Aunt said he left the house and havent returned since, and L is very creative, so she creates a play with her dolls, and i thought that was another play. Until i had noticed she wasn’t, later on L started to talk about details that she couldn't think of, or would never know if she haven't seen it all happen i front of her eyes, i called the police to search the house, they didn’t wanted to hear me, as i heard it all from a child that coulds easily “make something up”, i insisted for them to do it and eventually the cops finally went to search Aunt’s house. As they where searching the house, Aunt was calm all of the time, as if she knew there was no escape to her actions. When they finally went to check on the basement, Aunt wouldn’t let them in, she kept begin on the way of the cops and would not let them in. They had to handcuff her so she got out of the way of the cops. When they finally got inside the basement, they found not only Uncle's body in advanced stage of decomposition, but another body too, that was from a misssing teenage girl in the area who dissapeard after going to a party. turns out that was the cause of the fight, my uncle found the body an was going to report it. Aunt was arrested right in there, the police had more than enough proof against her, she is now in jail on death row wating for her execution.

What scares me is how that woman kept her husband's and a teenager's body in her basement for so damn long with a small child home.

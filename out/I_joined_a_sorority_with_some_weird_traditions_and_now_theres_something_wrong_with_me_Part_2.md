Looking back on it, it’s a miracle I made it through my freshman year of college.

I always knew it would be a big change. In high school it’s easy to be on multiple sports teams, or fudge on your homework or skip class. College is totally different. You’re on your own for the first time and you have to be self- motivated to succeed. 

I tried. I really, really tried. 

I went to every class, spent hours studying in the library, socialized with the other girls in my dorm, joined a sorority, and even went to a few parties.

It was just so much easier to ignore the dead guys when I stayed busy.

Ever since the night I pledged Delta Delta Psi, they had haunted me. I saw them everywhere now. I did my best to act normal, studying hard and dutifully putting in my hours at the sorority house. I knew I had dark circles under my eyes from the lack of sleep, but who doesn’t in college?

I was barely sleeping. I knew my grades were slipping. I could barely concentrate on anything.

Every day the ghosts got a little bolder. They were no longer content to just follow me, or watch me intensely as I walked across campus. Now they hovered closer than ever. Their forms seemed to be getting stronger, not weaker. They were ever present. I would see at least one of them almost every waking moment of my daily life.

There were seven of them that I saw regularly. 

Bag Head had, well, a plastic bag over his head. I was unnerved by the crinkled plastic, which sucked into his mouth every time he moaned, and the dark purple bruising around his neck. 

Wet Sneakers had clearly drowned. I could always tell he was nearby from the sound of squelchy footsteps. When I finally saw him up close, his bloated, rubbery face confirmed he had spent a long time underwater. Wherever he stood the carpet became saturated with water, which caused the library staff a lot of confusion over possible leaks.

The third gurgled thin, watery trails of vomit when he opened his mouth. I called him Drooly. His flesh had a green pallor. I suspected pills, alcohol poisoning, or something similar. He always appeared in the bathroom. I dreaded brushing my teeth for fear that he would appear beside me at the sink.

The Trio were always together. Their legs stuck out at odd angles, which gave them an unnatural gait. Dried blood covered their clothes and coated their white skin. One had a crater on his forehead with shards of broken glass. 

The one that tormented me the most was the Jogger.  He wore a pair of vintage sneakers and extremely short running shorts, the kind that were popular thirty years ago. He was mangled, like the Trio. Of all of them, he was the most bold. He was always with me. His icy fingers would reach out towards my face, and I could smell his rancid corpse breath when he opened his mouth. He came the closest to speaking. When he parted his cracked lips a weak, raspy sound would squeak out. I still hear it in my nightmares.

The worst part about him were his milky, undead eyes. I tried not to look at them, but it was hard not to when he followed me so closely.

There were definitely more than just the seven. The seven were just the ones that showed up consistently, that I remember the most. The others would flit by, showing up every now and again.

I knew there had to be a way to get rid of them for good. 

But I had another problem.

Time was running out. The initiation ceremony was coming up- and I’d been asked to do the unthinkable. 

Kill someone. Make *another* ghost for Delta Psi. All so they could continue their spells.

I’d replayed the conversation with Taylor, my sorority president, many times. I was starting to think I’d imagined it. Certainly, she was acting as if it hadn’t happened. I did everything to maintain the facade of normality when I was around her or the other sisters. I didn’t want them to know I was terrified of them. 

Terrified of what they had done, and what they might do to me if I didn’t comply.

Everyone always asks why I didn’t back out then. I would have loved to. Honestly, I was afraid. I didn’t know what they might do to me. Also, I had this feeling that I was *bound* to them after the first meeting. Something had definitely happened to me that night. I still received a lot of furtive glances from my male classmates (and a few female ones as well). I knew I looked good, more attractive than I should given the circumstances. No matter how tired I was, I still had some sort of ethereal charisma that just wasn’t there before.

Given the uncertain situation with my sorority, I was spending a lot of time hiding from the other girls in the library. That’s actually where I identified the first ghost.

It happened purely by accident. I was walking down one of the hallways towards the study cubicles, casually gazing at the magnified photos of past sports teams, when I spotted a face that looked familiar.

Sure enough- there was Jogger, cross country team ‘86.

I stared at the photo for a long time. I *wasn’t* crazy after all. I read through the names listed at the bottom and found his- Jody Arnold, class of ‘88.

With this tidbit of information, I went to a nearby desk and opened my computer, sociology homework forgotten. I googled combinations of his name, our town, and our school before an article finally popped up.

“Jody Arnold, Sophomore, Dies in Hit and Run”

I read through the page. It was him, alright, and I just *knew* some sisters from the eighties had killed him. Someone had been so dedicated to a glorified social club that they had run someone over with a car. I felt sick.

I searched for a long time before I found the others. I never was able to find anything definitive on all of them- but I at least found out their names and placed them in a yearbook. All of their deaths had been ruled accidents, overdoses, suicides. I knew the truth. Somehow, some girl had made them do it.

Finally, I located one of the Trio. Joey Thompson- he was in a yearbook from three years ago.  After googling his name, I discovered that he, and the other two, had died in a violent car accident. I found a local newspaper stub titled, “Three College Seniors Die in Car Crash.”

I skimmed the article. The last photo on the page stopped me cold. I zoomed in. The grainy newsprint shot revealed Taylor, in a group of students, at a memorial service. The caption identified her as a girlfriend.

I knew, immediately, in my gut that Taylor caused the crash. I would never be able to prove it, of course. My brain flashed the finale of *Carrie*, where she flipped a car with a glassy, wide eyed stare.

Taylor was powerful. More powerful than I realized. I would have to be careful if I was going to survive this. 

A plan began to form in my mind. I would play their game, bring them what they wanted. Maybe I could kill two birds with one stone- get rid of the ghosts, and break whatever hold Delta Delta Psi had on me.

The plan would have to be perfect. No room for error.

I knew I had one shot to pull this off, or I’d be dead.

The days leading up to Initiation passed much faster than I would have liked. I didn’t give Taylor or any of the others reason to suspect I would choke. On the surface I was a good little pledge, doing all the bitch work. I went to all the meetings and study sessions and acted as normal as possible.

On the evening of the initiation ceremony, I arrived at the door with a vial of blood. I handed it to Brooke as I stepped inside. She didn’t notice my shaking hands, or maybe she didn’t care.

Brook held it up to the light. “Excellent work. We knew you’d come through.” 

I joined the other two pledges. Brooke ushered us down the stairs into the basement, where Taylor and the others were waiting.

“Welcome to initiation, Ladies.” The three of us assembled at the front.

“Our pledges have completed their tests tonight, and now they will join us in becoming true sisters.” Brooke stepped forward with the vial, and poured it dramatically into the cup. Taylor held up the chalice. “They’ve proven their dedication to our sisterhood.” She winked at me.

To us she said, “You’ve tasted the power that comes with being a part of Delta Psi. But now you’re going to feel its full effects.”

“When you’re one of us, things that were hard will become easy. Money will come to you unexpectedly. And luck will be on your side.”

She took a deep drink and passed it to the others. When it came to me, I didn’t drink. *I hope this fucking works,* I thought. I dipped my fingers in the cup. Carefully, I drew a quick circle around myself- for protection. 

“Hey,” Brook asked, “What are you doing?” I ignored her and finished up my circle. 

I waited to see what happened to everyone else. It didn’t take long for them to feel the effects. I saw it on Taylor first. 

She was aging. 

Her perfect, dewy flesh became dull, and lines began to appear around her eyes and on her forehead. Her shiny platinum hair yellowed and started to frizz, and her tiny nose started to grow a significant bump in the middle. She touched her face gingerly. The same was happening to Alexis, Brooke, and most of the others. A quiet murmur of voices turned to wailing. The cheerful mood quickly soured.

Taylor looked right at me.

“What the fuck!” she screeched. “What did you do?”

I smiled.

“Well, I’ve been doing a lot of extra curricular *research* at the library. And do you know what I found? For one, period blood was an ingredient used in a lot of medieval spells. A *powerful* ingredient.”

She screamed, slumped to the floor and started crying. I leaned over her.

“What’s wrong Taylor? I thought you said ‘Pussy is Power.’ Apparently, you were right.”

I raised my voice so that it could be heard above the anguished wailing.

“The other thing I found out in the library? I found the faces of all the dead guys in the year books. That took a while. I had to go back all the way to 1979, but I found them all. All victims of Delta Psi.”

I looked around at everyone. “Jody Arnold,” I started. “Ben Burns, Larry Black, Chuck Smith, Joey Thompson (this name caused Taylor’s ugly head to snap up), Chris Baker, Marcus Williams, and all the *other v*ictims of Delta Delta Psi,” I yelled. “I summon you!” (Was it lame? Yes. I didn’t know what the fuck I was doing, but it was worth a shot). 

I felt like a fucking idiot, but the dead guys came through. 

There was a moment before we heard them on the steps. The trio never could walk very well. Their tortured footsteps on the staircase had my heart beating out of my chest. The room went quiet. When the girls saw their faces appear, all hell broke loose as everyone tried to back away from them. The others- Bag Head, Wet Sneakers, Drooly, and the Jogger- well, they weren’t far behind.

I didn’t stay long after that. I ran, and let the ghosts do the rest.

I didn’t see Taylor much after that night. Most of the old crew quietly dropped out of Delta Psi, graduated, and moved on with their lives, lessons learned. It was rumored, but never proven, that several of them spent time in a mental health facility. They weren’t much of a threat after I broke their power.

As for me, I got busy with schoolwork and volunteering. I tried to forget everything that happened, and worked hard to erase their toxic legacy. I brought attention to all of the people who went missing over the years, and we had a plaque dedicated to them put up on campus. It was odd, how no one really noticed they were gone before, almost like they had faded out of memory.

I stopped seeing the dead guys shortly after that. 

I still turn a few heads, and I’ve had a few boyfriends over the years. None that lasted. These days, I’m just too busy for a love life. 

Being president of Delta Delta Psi takes up a lot of my [time](https://www.reddit.com/r/SunshineScarystories/comments/x88quz/story_index/).

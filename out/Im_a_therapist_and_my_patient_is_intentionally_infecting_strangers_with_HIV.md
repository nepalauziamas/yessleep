"They *wanted* it," said Don. "That's what you're not understanding."

"Why would someone *want* to get HIV?" I asked.

The weather was finally nice enough for us to get some time outside, so we were sitting on the bleachers and tossing a baseball back and forth.

"Dr. Harper, you ever tried meth?"

"No," I said. "But—"

"Okay then. That's the problem," he said simply. "You don't get what kind of fucked up stuff it makes you feel."

"Meth makes people want to get HIV?" I said skeptically.

"It makes you want things you never knew you wanted…" He sounded like he was talking about a long-lost lover. "Imagine your most sketchy sexual fantasies, then multiply that by a million."

Don was a young man who had actually sought help from me before my trial, but I had gotten caught up with other clients.

"How is receiving an STD a sexual fantasy?"

"Because, you have a part of them inside of you forever," he said. "Plus, then you don't have to deal with the anxiety of getting HIV anymore."

I took a long look at him, trying to figure out if he was telling the truth.

"So…" I said. "You're telling me… All eight of the men who accused you of infecting them with HIV — they wanted it at the time?"

"Yes," he said. "We had conversion parties. They used the needle right after me, just to increase their odds. Then they would lay there—"

"Okay." I raised my hand. "I get it. So what changed their mind?"

"They got sober," he said with a laugh. "There's the first mistake. Without meth, they got ashamed of themselves and blamed it on me."

"What about you?" I asked. "Are you still using, after what it's done to your life?"

He looked at me and grinned.

"You've never let yourself lose control, have you?"

I cleared my throat. "This isn't about me."

"Well, this is the same kind of judgy bullshit that I'd expect from a control freak."

"I'm not judging!" I protested. "I'm just trying to understand what happened, so I can help you."

"And I'm telling you, these guys contacted *me* on Grindr. They saw the capital T for Tina. They saw I was positive. They were bug chasers."

"Bug chasers?"

"Dudes who *want* HIV," he said. "To get it over with. That way they don't have to worry about it anymore."

As we continued talking, I noticed Don's cellmate eyeing us from the nearby tables. As soon as I made eye contact with him, he looked away.

"Why is your cellmate watching us?"

I had already gotten into trouble for my unofficial therapy sessions, and I didn't want to draw any more unnecessary attention to myself.

"I don't know." Don shrugged. "He's probably jealous."

"Jealous?"

"Probably thinks you and I are gonna hook up," he said, leaning closer to me. "You wanna hook up?"

"Come on, Don—"

"I'd be down." He slowly ran his tongue across his lower lip. "Something about the way you're so hostile and rigid... Mmm."

I felt my face flush, losing any upper-hand I may have had in our dynamic.

"Look at you, going all red…" Don laughed. "Jesus, it's like you've never done it with another dude before."

My heart raced as I tried to come up with a way to change the topic. "We need to—"

"Holy shit." He leaned forward. "You're a virgin!"

"Don—"

"What, are you saving yourself for prison marriage?" he asked. "Come on, Harper, I'm gonna teach you how to have fun."

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a syringe.

"No!" I whispered, looking around anxiously. "Put that away!"

"Relax, Harper."

As I tried to shield us from the view of any guards, he prepared the needle and stuck it in his arm.

He took a deep breath in, and then let out a loud moan of pleasure.

"Now you."

He held out the syringe to me, and I quickly saw it was red with his blood.

"No." I shook my head, sliding a few inches away from him. "Absolutely not."

"Suit yourself." He shrugged. "Purity princess."

"This isn't about purity," I said, trying to regain control of the conversation. "It's about health and happiness. Don, don't you think there's a chance you're using sex and drugs to escape from some deeper issues?"

He frowned. "Like what?"

"I don't know," I said. "That's why I'm here. To learn more about you and your life."

"*Woo*!" His entire body shivered. "Okay, what do you want to know? I'm an open book."

"Are your mom and dad still in the picture?"

Therapy with an addict under the influence was about as effective as punching a brick wall, but at the very least I could try to understand how his current state of mind led to such reckless behavior.

"They kicked me out when I was a teenager."

"Because of your sexuality?" I asked.

"Yeah," he said. "The tragic gay boy cliche."

"Did that rejection hurt?" I asked. "From the people who are supposed to love you unconditionally?"

"I don't know," he said. "I didn't have time to think much about it. Had to find housing, money, all that."

"That's a lot to face at such a young age," I said gently. "No wonder you never had a chance to process the rejection."

His eyes met mine for a few moments, frenzied and dilated. And then, to my horror, he stuck his hand down his pants.

"What are you—"

But before I could protest any further, he covered my mouth with his other hand.

"I'm so fucking hot for you right now."

I squirmed to get away, but he was much stronger than me. I let out a muffled scream and desperately scanned the prison yard around us. Don's cellmate was the only one paying us any attention. I stared at him, eyes pleading — but he turned away.

"*You want this*…" Don whispered into my ear. "*You want this*."

And seconds later, that's when I felt it.

The sting of a needle in my arm.

  

*Where am I?*

"Hello?" I call out, but my own voice is all that returns to me. 

A clean hallway with shiny floors stretches out in front of me. The air is tinged with Pine-Sol and floor wax.

"Hello?" I call again. No answer.

I look through a window on one of the doors. It seems like a fairly standard classroom with, a chalkboard, desks, and windows at the far side of the room that show other classrooms. I continue to explore, turning right at the end of the hall.

I pause at the corner and look back at the hallway I just came from, and then this hallway, they're identical.

The classrooms are all to the right, while a row of lockers lines the left.

Out of curiosity, I open one of the lockers. Paper streams out of it like a waterfall. At first, I try to stem the flow but quickly realize the futility. 

I pick up a few pieces. They're blank notebook paper.

I move on, looking in the next classroom. It’s the same as the last.

And the next...

And the next...

And the next...

At the end of the hall, I make another right. It leads to another identical hallway.

In the next classroom, I see something different. I walk in and pick up the paper that’s sitting on a student’s desk. It reads, 'Final exam: In five hundred words or more, describe how your life would be different if you were given a second chance'.

*Oh my God! I remember!*

The enormity of these words hit me like a truck.

I fall into the chair. My shaking knees refuse to hold me up.

I stare at the paper for a while when I notice an old clock sitting on the teacher's desk. It's set for four o'clock, but something about it is strange. The second hand is ticking backward.

*This is impossible!*

I run to the end of the hall.

Another right.

I continue to run.

Hall.

Right.

Hall.

Right.

*It's never-ending. There’s no way out!*

“This isn’t funny!” I scream. “Let me out of here! Computer, end program! Whatever I need to say or do, get me the hell outta here!”

The only sound that returns is the echo of my voice. 

Despair smothers me. 

It drags me, kicking and screaming to the bottom of the ocean where I meet acceptance.

*I’m really dead. This isn’t a dream, this isn’t a joke, this isn’t the Matrix.*

I crumple into the chair, staring at the piece of paper and it stares right back.

*So this is it? My eternity decided by a single essay question?*

I glance up at the clock but it no longer reads four o’clock. Now it’s three forty-seven.

*Countdown. I don’t want to know what happens when it gets to zero.* 

I look through the desk, but nothing's there to write with. No pen, no pencil, not even a crayon.

I look in the next desk…nothing.

And the next...

And the next...

And the next...

I search the whole room and find nothing. The teacher's desk is locked so I move on to another room. It’s a disturbingly exact copy of the last, right down to the spot I left the paper sitting on the desk. 

The next three rooms are the same.

I focus on the teacher’s desk. Pulling and prying for all I'm worth to force the middle drawer open. 

In desperation, I take a student’s desk and smash it on top of the other. Over and over I bash it with all my strength. Finally the top splinters just a bit. I redouble my efforts and am rewarded with a large sliver of wood jammed into my arm. I scream out in pain, but my reward is a smashed lock.

I slowly pull open the drawer.

Empty.

I open the side drawers.

Empty.

*Dammit!*

I run into the hallway and start opening lockers, throwing paper through the hall. Every room I search is empty. Every locker is filled with paper. In desperation, I climb onto a desk and try to lift a ceiling panel, but they’re unnaturally heavy and won’t budge. After ripping open every locker in four hallways, I turn right and find the next is pristine. Not a single sheet of paper on the floor, not a single locker open. It’s as if I had done nothing.  

Despair creeps up on me and digs its claws in, riding me like a backpack. 

\*Bang\*

\*Bang\*

\*Bang\*

I bash my head against the locker. Finally collapsing to the floor. 

*So I’m going to hell because I don’t have a pencil. This is every teacher’s dream.*

The silence overwhelms me.

For the first time, it hits me how totally alone I am. The solitude that I once craved now pierces my heart and sends tears streaming down my cheeks.

The only sound I hear is my breathing and a slow drip.

*Where is that coming from?*

I look around and to my surprise, the floor has red spots on it. I follow to the source. It's my wrist. A two-inch-long sliver of wood is jammed in under the skin, right beside my wrist. 

*Can you bleed to death wherever this is?*

I watch my vital fluids drip out with a strange mix of curiosity and apathy.

Suddenly a thought hits me like a bolt of lightning.

I jump up and run to the nearest classroom. 

The clock on the desk reads three-fifteen.

I sit down with my paper, and painfully pull the sliver out, causing the blood to flow more quickly. I hold my wrist over the pencil trough on the desktop, pooling blood into it.

I dip it in the blood and start writing.

"The reasons I should return to my life are..."

\*\*\*

Four pages of paper and three hours later, I struggle to my feet, feeling weak from the loss of blood. I set them beside the clock and wait for the countdown to end.

It dutifully chimes twelve times then disappears along with the papers. I wait, looking around the room.

“Well?” I yell at the ceiling. “Did I pass? Are you going to grade it and send it back to me?”

The ceiling doesn’t answer. 

I collapse to the floor, weak from blood loss. 

*So that’s it then? I guess it wasn’t good enough. I’m stuck in this eternal hell of solitude. Can you go insane in the afterlife?*

My thoughts become less coherent as the blood pools beneath me. 

*Maybe I’ll just take a little nap.*

I lay down, resting my head on my arm, and close my eyes.

\*\*\*

“He’s coming around!”

“Can you hear me?”

“What’s your name?”

The bright lights and cacophony of the room startle me after being alone.

I hear the steady beeping of a machine. I see people in blue clothes, masks, and gloves. One of them stands over me holding two electroshock paddles.

“I think he’s out of the woods,” he says.

I take in my surroundings, remember the accident I was in, and consider myself lucky.

*Thank God it was a dream.*

I close my eyes again, not noticing the scar on my wrist just beside the vein.

*beep beep beep!* my alarm droned. I rolled over, fiddling with the screen until I dismissed the obnoxious sound. Begrudgingly, I pushed myself up and went about preparing for another day.

Mindlessly, I locked the front door, unlocked my Venza, sat in the driver's seat, and off I went. One car passed me, then sat beside me at the red light. I stole a glance at my fellow early bird, then made a double take.

The driver… the driver had no face! I leaned further and further through my open window, inspecting the inhuman driver. The thing slowly tilted its blank head as though it could see through invisible eyes. After an instant, a stomach churning sucking and tearing crept deep into my ears. A wound tore horizontally across the head, a bloody, sinister smile. I recoiled in horror and shock, biting my tongue in the chaos.

Somewhere behind me, a horn blared twice. Not that I needed the reminder, I slammed the gas. I needed to get the hell out of there, as the speedometer climbed and climbed.

Catching my breath, I realized the echoing squelch of that thing's ripping skin was gone, replaced by a piercing siren. Red and blue lights strobed across the space behind me. I had attracted the police, perfect! They can protect me from that thing!

I carefully slowed my car, pulling over against the curb. I turned my engine off and laid my hands on the steering wheel. Never having been pulled over, I imagined that was the best bet.

"Keep your hands on the steering wheel." A gruff, tired sounding man ordered. A door closed behind me, then a pair of footsteps approached my opened window. "Do you know how fast you were going?" The cop demanded.

"N-no sir, but I saw something! A monster!" I stammered. The cop slid something from his belt, then spoke very coldly.

"Saw something? What'd you see, exactly?" He spoke in the tone a parent uses when a child regales the story of the monsters in their closet. Condescending.

"Sir! I know how it sounds, but I assure you, I am not crazy." I backtracked, letting my eyes drift to the side mirror. The officer was tall and toned, though slightly hunched over. His service pistols was out and pointing to the ground, though his face was out of view.

"What did you see." He stated, rather than asked.

"A person, a faceless person…" I shuddered, thinking back to that wretched ripping sound.

"Have you had any illicit substances?" The officer bounced the ball back to my court, wasting no time.

"No sir," I stated firmly. "I don't even drink at parties."

The officer strode the last few steps towards my door, drawing his flashlight. "Do me a favor. Get out slowly, then follow my light."

I carefully placed my hand on the latch, opening the door. I cautiously climbed to my feet, weaving my fingers behind my neck. I turned to face the officer, then screamed involuntarily. 

The faceless man in police uniform cocked his head, the muscles on the gun arm flexing. The instant after I processed the lack of a face, the same sucking tearing tore across the smooth skin. The demonic smile stayed level despite the crooked head, causing the gaping wound to cut the head into uneven halves.

Bloody spiddle splattered my face as the officer shouted, "stay calm or I WILL shoot!" He warned, raising his pistol. The gash did not move with his words.

I stumbled back and fell hard on my side, fighting whether to stand and obey, or attempt an escape. I knew I wouldn't be able to run, regardless of whatever the monster was capable of, it had a gun. Knowing that did not make it any easier to stay still. In fact, it made it even more challenging. 

I quivered violently, teeth chattering, fighting a war I couldn't win. There were no good options. I resigned myself to whatever fate has chosen, I just prayed it would be quick.

Pin pricks shot up and down my body, as I laid slumped. I shot an eye open, confused. I was still alive. My body was sore from the strange position I'd been laying, though I was mostly unharmed. Save for some scratches and a bite mark looking wound, I was okay.

"I'm taking you home. I don't have time for your type of crazy." The same cop spat through the grate separating us. Not willing to look a gift horse in the mouth, I stayed silent. I stayed silent as I wormed my way out of the seat. I stayed silent as I trudged to my front door and unlocked it. I stayed silent as I passed the faceless pictures that once held friends and relatives. I stayed silent as I typed this. I stay silent even now, as I hear the wet tearing of flesh from down the hall. I will stay silent forevermore.

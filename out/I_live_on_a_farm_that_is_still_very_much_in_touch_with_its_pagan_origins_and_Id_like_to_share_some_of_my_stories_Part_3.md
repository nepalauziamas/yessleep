It would have been fitting if Pete had reappeared on the anniversary of his disappearance. If the days had aligned so exactly decades in the future.

There were no longer any family celebrations at the farm. Relatives stayed away, unwilling to lose one of their own nearest and dearest. They came together when my great grandmother died, but left early and didn't let the children out of their sight. 

My grandparents and my father and my Uncle Joe still did something every year in his memory. It was an empty kind of mourning, with no grave to visit and no closure, but he was lost and the knowledge could scarcely be overlooked. They never laid flowers, because that would be admitting he was gone forever. Instead, they would leave small items of his at the base of the fence by the Old Paddock. Even though he'd disappeared behind a bush, everyone knew the Footprint was to blame, and besides, the bush had long been torn up. They had dug deep beneath where its roots had been, looking for old mine shafts that might have claimed him. 

The items they left were always gone the next day. Maybe the Footprint took them as an offering, or maybe an animal had stolen them. But for more than 23 years they continued their practice.

The day Pete came back was cold and grey, with a freezing, thick fog. By that time, Joe had married, and although he and his wife had stuck around for a while, they had left when Joe's wife had fallen pregnant. It's not that they didn't want any part of farm life, they just didn't want to raise a child on that farm. Not a farm that swallowed offspring. My father had stayed, shouldering the burden bitterly, and when he married my mother she had come to live on the farm with no qualms whatsoever. It has never surprised me that my mother embraced the oddities of the farm so readily. She is a lovely woman, but strange. If she'd lived in the city I feel like she would have been the one children called a witch, but here on the farm she was just practical, and fitted in perfectly. She collected small animal bones which she kept in carefully labeled jars, and threw salt over her left shoulder, and never opened an umbrella in the house. She saluted magpies every single time she saw one, and the only time I ever saw her really upset was when my brother had been tasked with clearing the table after the evening meal and had neglected to remove the table cloth. He had been about to go to bed when she'd found him and scolded him.

"Never leave a white tablecloth on the table overnight!" she told him. "It brings death!"

I realise I haven't spoken much about my brother, but I do have one. An older one named Luke. He left as soon as he turned 18 to go and live in The City. My father had hoped he would take on the farm, but Luke always maintained he couldn't wait to get away, and kept his word. He had left directly after his birthday dinner, kissing my mother goodbye as she wept, and nodding at my father.

He sends me emails sometimes. He works with computers. And he was my ally for a while before he left. 

Anyway. My father had been up early to deal with the morning milking. My mother was heavily pregnant with Luke but she still got up to prepare breakfast. My grandfather had arthritis and took longer to get going in the mornings, so my father had gone on ahead. He had a dog with him - the predecessor to poor, doomed Rowan, the dog I'd killed by playing on the stones. This dog was a sturdy mongrel of indiscriminate ancestry, named Conan, that my father had hand raised from a puppy and he followed my father everywhere, but on this occasion he had run off into the fog despite my father calling after him. 

It was unlike Conan to disobey a command, and that in itself was unusual enough for my father to take a diversion and go after him. 

"I knew something was up," my father would tell me years later. "Conan hardly ever barked, and that day he was bellowing. Sounded strange in the fog and I could barely tell which direction it was coming from. Sounded like I had a hundred big dogs surrounding me from all sides, all of them barking up a storm." 

It will surprise nobody that my father eventually tracked Conan to the Old Paddock. The big dog was stood by the fence, legs braced, tail up, the fur along his back raised in a stiff trail along his spine. He was in full attack mode, and my father held back only a little before calling him to heel. Conan ignored his command and kept barking 

There was a figure in the Paddock. Human shaped, but in the fog only barely. My father said it stood like a person, but in a weird stance. It had its head tilted back so far the figure looked headless initially, and its arms were held awkwardly out from its body. 

My father said he'd wanted to run, but the strange sight had pulled him in. 

When he got closer, he could see that the figure was indeed human. It was shivering, its limbs vibrating in an irregular rhythm, its thrown back head shaking from side to side. 

My father put his hand on Conan's head, and the dog stopped barking immediately. It was no comfort. The shape was directly in the centre of the Footprint, something my father could not entirely comprehend. Nothing willingly stood in the Footprint. 

He pushed the dog back. Cleared his throat. A part of him knew who was standing there, but logic wouldn't allow the notion. But he called his brother's name anyway.

The figure stopped its gyrations. Lifted its head into a more normal posture, and turned towards my father. The thing in the field wore my uncle's clothes and face. Its limbs stuttered and trembled, but it took unsteady steps towards the fence. 

Pete was sobbing, my father said. Huge, wracking sobs that shook his entire body, accounting perhaps for the strange stance he had. 

"He looked just like Pete," my father told me. "Exactly as he'd looked when he'd disappeared, a 16 year old boy, despite all the years that had passed. Except for his hair. That was white. And his face, while still young, wore an expression no 16 year old should have any cause to wear. It was full of horror I can't even imagine, twisted and bunched like a shirt that had been washed and dried all scrunched up."

My father had been terrified, he said, but his empathy for his long lost brother had overshadowed everything. Common sense had no part. 

Pete had clambered over the fence with an awkwardness that disturbed my father. His arms and legs seemed too long, and the joints bent at angles that shouldn't have been possible, but still my father had helped him. He told me, decades later, that touching my uncle was akin to performing a task that needed to be done, even though it was repulsive. Imagine pulling slimy, clotted hair from the plughole of a bathtub, or squeezing pus from an inflamed boil. It was disgusting, but satisfying. It felt right and wrong all at the same time. 

Pete couldn't speak. His teeth chattered together in a sporadic rhythm that stifled any sounds he wished to vocalise. There were noises, but nothing verging on language. 

Conan refused to approach him. That in itself made my father reluctant to engage with the man they had found. He kept his distance, even though his instinct was to embrace his long lost brother. 

My grandfather had arrived then, stiff in his limbs but drawn by the drama. There were tears, my father told me, but he had never been able to discern whether they were of joy or fear. 

Nothing really happened in between finding Pete and Pete finding his way back to the house, but the way my father told it always made it seem loaded. He never elaborated. But one minute Pete was weeping in the fog, and the next my grandmother was holding him. 

It should have been a happy reunion, by anyone's standards, but even as my grandmother wept and held her long lost son, my grandfather was also weeping and loading his shotgun. 

"He wasn't right," my father said. "Your mother walked into the kitchen, took one look, and walked straight back out again, holding her big pregnant belly. She didn't want your unborn brother anywhere Uncle Pete. The gods know we loved him, but that wasn't properly him, and your grandma might have cried, but when your grandad finished loading his gun she wiped her eyes and stepped away without looking back. Turned her head and attended to the dough that had been proving by the stove. It was all I needed to see. "

It took many years and many drinks for my father to tell me what happened next. A family secret that wasn't really a secret at all, just something they didn't want to say. I know my grandparents and parents had been kind. Pete, or whatever it was, was never treated cruelly, even though my father and grandfather coaxed him back out of the house with no space for argument. He was led back to the Paddock, and my father freely admitted that he'd held the Pete thing's hand despite the discomfort and wrongness he'd felt coming from the intruder. He told me that the thing pretending to be Pete suffered, that its agonised utterances were real enough, but that nobody of good conscience could allow it to continue to exist. 

I can't begin to imagine how they felt. Whether it was my uncle or not, whether it was a changeling or my actual abused uncle - the distinction was never actually made - the poor thing had to die. There was no coming back from the Footprint. 

I am aware I sound confused as to whether it was my uncle or not, but to be fair, nobody has ever been able to say whether it was him. Whoever or whatever it was/they were didn't belong here. 

There are many phrases that could be used to describe the demise of the Pete thing. Execution. Euthanasia. Murder. 

If we're looking at less humane terms, disposal might be a good fit. He was disposed of. Ended. Right there by the Footprint even as he wailed and trembled. 

Culled. 

My grandfather blew his head off at close range, not without emotion but full of it, and whether it was supernatural or natural the body died all the same. 

They dug a hole, my father and grandfather. Dug a grave right by the Footprint and rolled the body of the poor thing into it and covered it up. Then went to milk the cows. Because the cows needed milking no matter what else had happened. 

My mother is a traditionalist. Pete's disappearance had been common knowledge, but his reappearance was only known to a select few, officially. But she still noted it on her calendar, and every year made tribute on both dates. It was a ritual for her, a superstitious promise that it wouldn't happen again, like a rainbow for Christians who want to believe that there would never be another flood. 

Sometimes her tribute was a bouquet from a florist, but more often it was a tangle of bones or herbs, tied up with ribbons, and blessed with good intentions.

"I love you," her offerings said. "I miss you. But never come back." 

And I can't help but agree and be thankful for her efforts. 

There is more to tell, and I will tell more, but it is Pete's anniversary, and I cannot, in all conscience, talk about the Shuck whilst my father mourns. 

Be well people. Hold your loved ones close, because if you don't, something else out there will.

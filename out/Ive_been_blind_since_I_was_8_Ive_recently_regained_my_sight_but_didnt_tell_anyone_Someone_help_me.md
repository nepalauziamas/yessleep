I write this in the hope that someone realizes who I am and can save me. My name is Victor Williams, and I am a male. When I was eight, my vision slowly started to fade away, and the last time I looked at my parents, they were sobbing uncontrollably at me, because I would no longer be able to see them. My mother was Irish and my Father was Carribean-Indian, and were both 6’2”. My father was bald and my mother was red-haired. 

For 9 years, I could not see, and relied on my ears. But recently, I slowly started to be able to perceive objects in a vague manner. I could tell what I was looking at, but it was muddled and blurry. I was ecstatic, and almost cried. I went to my parents to see them, but as I went downstairs, I stopped to see them in the kitchen. 

That’s when I began to notice. My parents are not my parents. Even though my vision is blurred, I can tell. My mother isn’t as tall as she was, and my father has hair, on a head not shaped like his. Whenever they talk to me, I now realize that they speak in a cold, ominous undertone, like they know… something. Or I don’t know something. Both equally terrify me, but the ladder… is a chilling thing. Even my sister is different. She looks older than myself. And her hair is… vaguely luminescent, in a way. It’s like she put glitter in her hair. But it’s always red, almost. 


But the crowning feature is the most terrifying. Their eyes are black. Not even a dark brown, like a dark, colorless, emotionless void swallowed up by the ending of time itself. 

This discovery shook me to the very core. I was living in a house of ominous strangers pretending to be my family. My sleep turned into inner turmoil, and the gift of sight became Hell on Earth. Morbid curiosity lead me to research what might be happening. This research is what is leading me to finally realize a horrible truth.

In Texas, there’s a local legend of the Black Eyed Children. They inflict serious bad fortune to anyone who helps them or even interacts with them. They prey on innocence and willingness to help for their agendas. I then realized that we have never had guests over more than once in our lives, and they took me upstairs whenever any came. Maybe, just maybe, it was coincidence?

Until I realized that they would leave for hours at a time on the weekends and leave me at home, because they assumed I couldn’t see them or hear them. But I recently saw them do it. But when they happen to come back, they’re dead silent. I never would have noticed. It’s almost like they didn’t want me to know they were gone. One day however, a piercing scream could be heard through the neighborhood. They came back panting and I could hear them audibly preparing for the worst. My heart leaped into my throat like it gained consciousness, and I slowly start to formulate a plan. Observe more. Snoop around the house to figure out what they’ve been hiding from me. 

Another night, they left, and I searched the house. The attic is empty, their rooms contain nothing suspicious except… in my mothers room, there is a book. It has no title, and is written in an indecipherable codex or language. 

I decide to check the source of all horror in any house, the basement. I walk down the steps, and I see nothing and hear nothing, as well. But as I walk down the steps, I notice something I had never thought would be here. A door under the basement stairwell. It smells awful, and I can already tell I’m gonna piss myself walking in there. 

My heart beats like a machine gun with a sticky trigger, and I reluctantly open. The room is empty. Or is it? As I really focus on the walls, I notice…. hooks? Chains? That’s when I notice two things. One thing was a person on a rack on the end of the room. He was strung up with old wire, and was smiling a horrible, forced unnaturally smile, and was smeared in blood, and his eyes were… in his open mouth. The second thing? My parents unlocking the door to get in. And when they walked in the door, my mind finally clicked, and the switch turned on. That’s when I connected the dots. The red glitter in my “sisters” hair isn’t glitter. It’s blood.

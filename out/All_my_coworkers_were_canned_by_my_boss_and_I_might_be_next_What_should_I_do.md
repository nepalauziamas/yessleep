I am sure you have heard the headlines about the worker shortage—how businesses are closing because they can’t find employees (or frankly pay them enough). Our bakery is no exception. The turnover here is insanely high, I have seen employees quit on their first day; hell, I am the longest tenured employee here, and I started last month. My manager, Jess, seldom seen around, keeps sending memos about needing a more competent workforce. 

Given all this, I was taken aback when I came into work this morning and saw her waiting by the till. 

“Hey Todd, just wanted to let you know that all your coworkers were let go this morning. We do have managers from corporate coming in to fill the gaps. Appreciate you manning the front.”

“Even Carlos? I thought he was doing a great. job.”

“Well with our recent quarter, some sacrifices must be made.”

I couldn’t do anything more than nod even though Carlos was my close friend. I needed the job to pay my rent; besides, no other place would pay $25/hour to sit at the front and greet people coming in.

 Not that we had customers anyway, I would see maybe two or three people a day come in and almost never purchase anything. Business to Business transactions, I think the term was, although what business requires baked bread and croissants everyday was a little confusing to me.

I sat at my desk and put on my earphones to listen to my indie playlist. I know, I know, but I had to drown out the loud machine sounds somehow. Most days it felt like I was sitting in an airplane hangar and listening to F-15s fly every ten minutes. Working in an industrial bakery does have it perks though—the whole damn place smells like sweet bread and I had access to the most delicious donuts in the break room. I never quite understood how they made those, though a copious amount of sugar was probably the right answer. 

Looking in from the outside, you wouldn’t guess that this dilapidated warehouse makes some of your favorite treats in town. Hell, half the entrance is covered in sheet metal. The floor inside is wood, which is close to the end of its life, and leads to my desk, which sits right in front of the factory, if you can even call it that. The door to it is locked and workers typically use a side entrance, though I have never been inside due to something about OSHA certifications.

It was close to the end of the day, and I was trying my best to not fall asleep when I heard the high-pitched sound of a truck backing up. Our deliveries were never this late in the day. I saw a tall, lanky man come in and greet me. 

“Hey, I am here to deliver these to Jess. It was marked urgent, and I am sorry for the delay,” he said, pointing to the 5 boxes on the ground. 

“Got it, I will let her know you stopped by.”

“Could you sign this for me?”

I looked at the boxes and loaded them up on our company dolly. Work policy was to leave it by the door to the factory and leave a note to Jess. As I was rolling the squeaky yet sturdy dolly to the entrance, I noticed that the door was open. Normally I would never go the extra mile for my job, but I was bored and thought I could place it inside or hand it to Jess.  

I opened the door and was greeted by loud mechanical whirring. I tried to push my way in since the door was heavy, and rolled in the dolly. The room itself was pitch black and smelled like bleach. I used my hand to try to find the light switch, the walls felt rough and coarse, almost like the popcorn ceilings in my house. 

I eventually felt the light switch and turned it on. My eyes were blinded by an almost clinical white light. I looked around for the first time. In contrast to its dilapidated exterior, the place was adorned with the most high-tech manufacturing equipment I had ever seen. It felt like being in a futuristic manufacturing plant. The machines were shiny and grinding non-stop. I was surprised to see that no one was around, though I attributed that to the general behavior of managers. Personal items such as badges, uniforms, and safety vests were neatly folded in a corner overlooking what I could only assume was a machine to mix in the dough

Overlooking the machines was a series of rooms with clear glass windows. A high ceiling combined with the brightest lights made me feel like I was almost in a lab. I looked at the machines for a while, but never saw any products except for some preservatives. You would think that an industrial sized bakery would have some dough, flour, or chocolate around. The assembly line was not moving, but it was still deafeningly loud. 

I made my way to the stairs to what I assumed was Jess’ office. I knocked on the door a few times but there was no answer. I know I shouldn’t have, but curiosity got the best of me. I opened the door and walked in. 

Her office was clean, with a big table placed right by the window, overlooking the manufacturing process. A landline was neatly placed between a stack of papers. As I set down the boxes, my leg bumped into a small stack of cans. I picked one up.

The can had an intricate pattern and was made from very expensive metal. I held it and tried to make sense of why my manager had a bunch of cans in her office. I flipped it over. 

Written in cursive was the name Lydia. A bit odd, I thought, so I picked up another jar. Then another. Then another. The jars all had names of my coworkers. The last one had Carlos hastily scribbled on it. 

Before I could make sense of the situation, I heard footsteps coming my way. My heart was beating rapidly, and I felt a lump in my throat. My gut was telling me something was extremely wrong. I quickly grabbed the can and snuck my head out the door and saw someone near the far end of the factory. I tried to run out to the left near the exit sign. The only way out was through the door and that meant that I had to run across the floor. 

I saw the worker come up to one of the rooms. Sensing an opportunity, I ran straight toward the door and into my car. My heart in my mouth, I locked the door and booked it out of there. I got back to my apartment and started pacing around. The can stood in the middle of my living room. Something about the whole place seemed very wrong. Why did they have huge industrial machines? Where were all the employees? 

After deliberating for an hour, I decided to open the can.

With my can opener in hand, I slowly cut through the top. Almost immediately I was taken aback with the rottenest stench in the world. The room slowly filled with a foul odor. I had to run and grab a mask from the kitchen. Inside was what I can only describe as moldy tomato puree. It was almost like a slushy that had been sitting in a car for two months. 

I poured it out into a cup. It all started making sense to me. The missing coworkers, the industrial equipment, hell even the OSHA certifications. I reached for my phone. Someone had to know what to do. I called 911.

I heard a knock by the door. 

The boxes. Fuck.

I wasn’t foolish enough to open the door. I ran to my bedroom.

Dispatch said they would send someone right away.

It has been over an hour now. I don' know how long I have left.

   Let me start off by saying, I don’t see my friends very often anymore. The reason I shut my friends out is because of “the incident” that occurred back in middle school. We didn’t get into a fight or anything, it’s because of a game.
 
  It started as a stupid idea for a game, the year was 2014. My friend group consisted of Logan, Christy, David and Alicia, for story purposes I will not state my name. We were not very popular, usually we sat in the corner of the lunchroom. 

   It was Spring Break and we wanted to spend more time together. We were spending the night at my house as my parents were absent for the weekend. We were playing your typical board games and run of the mill sleepover party games. But then we weren’t.

   Logan suggested a game he had learned at Summer Camp. The game was titled “Aut Celare Mors” you play by saying some stupid gibberish while one player stands in the middle of a circle you must form. The person then becomes “possessed”and you must hide, or you die. My friends and I did not believe in this, yet we were proven very wrong.

  We forced Logan to step into the middle of the circle. We then muttered some strange gibberish. And for a solid minute nothing happened, until Logan started seizing, blood began pouring out of his mouth only for him to begin laughing. His pupils rolled back in his head… and then he started counting.

  My friends and I did not know what to think, except to hide. I’m not quite sure where Christy hid yet I knew David and Alicia hid together. Logan began saying “Ready or Not?” In a voice that clearly was not his. Logan then began roaming around to try to find his prey.

  I did hear Christy begin to scream, as well as a sickening splat. I was still in a cabinet in my parents room. I immediately heard running coming my way and someone began going through everything in my parents room, it was not Logan, I did see David however, he spotted me and told me that Alicia was dead and we needed to get out of here. 

  However we heard Logans footsteps begin coming our way. I hid back in my place and David hid in the shower. Logan then left the room and was occupied in a different room. David and I then tried to book it towards the door. We did not get far before Logan spotted us. He then started spewing more blood from his mouth and fell over. David had now been covered in Logans blood. David and I approached Logan and had found out, he was dead.

  David and I unlocked the door and ran out of my house very quickly. I got pretty far before noticing David was no longer next to me. I looked back to see David start seizing while his eyes rolled back, far back into his head, and then, David began to count.

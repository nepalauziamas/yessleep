Hi, my name is Drake. I live alone in this house, but notes keep appearing around me. The handwriting admittedly looks similar to mine, but significantly neater. My handwriting is ridiculously sloppy, these notes are actually legible, so that kind of rules out them being from me. For these notes to actually be from me, it would take an incredible amount of lessons, or practice or something, and my life has just never given me a reason to search out those things.

I don’t remember precisely when they started appearing, but it’s been some time now, and the lies keep getting more and more outlandish. They started off small, things like reminding me to finish the leftovers for a meal I never made, or telling me to order a food I don’t like when grocery shopping. Obviously a lie, but relatively harmless.

I should probably hurry, I’m starting to think I won’t survive this. My gun is right next to me, I’ve had it in this room for, how long? Has to be at least a couple decades at this point. In any case, it’s familiar, but I’m not sure if it will protect me from whatever is going on.

Let’s try to get back in order, what was I saying? The notes. They started small, but got bigger and bigger. I removed once it told me to pick up a car from an auto-mechanic, despite my only car being in the driveway. Weirdly enough, the car described in the note did eventually appear in the driveway beside my own, despite me never doing anything.

I haven’t worked up the bravery to do anything about it, no one ever taught me how to deal with magically appearing cars, so I’ve been too afraid too touch it. Nevertheless, it seems to sometimes move on its own. Sometimes it’s there, sometimes it’s not.

 the weirdest thing was a note I got One day seemingly at random. it was a reminder to go to an appointment I never booked, this particular note got repeated quite a few times. Constantly telling me to go to an appointment, when I never booked an appointment. I wasn’t injured, and I had already had my well-check a while back.

These notes just kept getting stranger and stranger, as if I wouldn’t see through their lies. Things really reached their peak recently though. I think whatever has been leaving the notes is trying to kill me.

I started recently receiving notes insisting that I had a wife, and that I could trust her, but that’s ridiculous. I never so much as dated anyone. The idea that I have a wife is completely preposterous, so I can only assume the entity is after me in person now.

True to form, I heard footsteps moving around downstairs. I even heard a woman call my name. I locked my door, which is lucky, because whatever is on the other side of that door did try it. They left when it was locked, but they came by a couple more times after that.

The length of time between attempts is shrinking, and the voice sounds more and more insistent. I think it might not be long now before it breaks down the door.

I tried my hardest to hide, but I suppose sometimes you have to fight. Maybe it can leave notes, but can it survive a bullet? We‘ll see when it gets through the door I guess.

If started pounding on the door, sounds like my time is up. Guess I’ll get to try out the new gun sooner than expected.

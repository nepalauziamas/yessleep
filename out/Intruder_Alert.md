An intruder alert woke us up.

We have a security system that tells us if someone has gained access to the house. 

My Mum shot out of bed and grabbed a knife she had hidden in her drawer.

She gave me it, telling me to stay in the cupboard.

'Don't make a sound!' She said, putting her finger to her lips.

I last saw her leaving the room as I closed the cupboard door.

I could hear some things smashing and getting thrown around downstairs.

Then I heard her voice, confronting the intruder.

He screamed at her, then I could hear a violent struggle.

2 loud bangs preceded absolute silence.

I didn't even want to imagine what had just happened??

I was shaking, terrified, looking through the crack in the door into my Mum's room.

More clattering of things downstairs startled me.

It sounded like someone just trashing the place.

I could see her phone on the dresser table, but I could also hear wood creaking as someone ascended the stairs.

I'm not sure if I had time to go and grab it.

Footprints stomped past my Mum's room all the way to the end.

I could hear my bed, all my toys being thrown and smashed off the walls.

I opened the cupboard door just a bit.

Being as light footed as I can, I got the phone from the table and managed to get back inside in the nick of time.

Heavy footsteps approached the door to the room.

I held my breath.

I couldn't control my body shaking, I was worried it might be noisy.

I looked at the phone...

**1% Battery**

A darkened figure emerged from the hallway, I quickly moved away from the gap in the door.

He didn't touch anything in here, he just stood there looking around.

His breathing was rough and heavy.

This whole situation stirred something within me, but I couldn't quite place it, I felt like I had been here before.

He turned around and walked out, I pulled the phone back out and dialled the police.

It rang once, I could have cried when the battery died, I felt like just giving up and going out.

The footsteps paced up and down the hall and the intruder was muttering to himself.

'I'm gonna kill them, gonna kill them, kill them' he said, getting more and more aggressive.

Tears streamed down my face as I cupped a hand over my mouth to prevent any noises.

As he paced up and down outside, he started getting louder, more angry.

'I can't, I can't kill anymore!' 

'But I should, I should kill them right now'

I wet myself, I was shaking with so much fear and trying my hardest not to cry through my hands but it was no use, I was bound to give away my position any second.

The boot stormed in with rapid pace, banging on the floor like hammers.

The cupboard doors flew open with force.

I let out a scream as the tall, ragged looking man holding an axe stood over me, with his tattered clothes and beard, he almost looked homeless.

But... there was something about him.

'Hi, Son!' He said.

...

I looked through my blurry tear filled eyes at a vision of pure horror.

'Dad?' I replied as I managed to stifle a cry.

'I'm home' he said, more softly.

He picked me up, the knife fell on the floor but he never took any notice.

'She can't keep us apart anymore Son!' 

He smiled with chipped rotting teeth, a horrible smell came from his mouth.

'W-where's Mum?' 

'Don't worry about her anymore kid, she can't keep me from you, I told her that years ago and she still tried to keep you from me!' 

I was speechless, confused.

Suddenly a memory made itself known to me, in fact, many memories came flooding back in an instant.

My Dad always coming home drunk out of his mind and beating the living hell out of my Mum while I hid in the cupboard.

Sometimes he wouldn't find me.

Sometimes he did.

I can't remember what he done to me but there was a deep rooted, almost natural, instinctual fear of this man.

*That's why we moved away*, I thought 

I remember my Mum saying he would come looking for us.

I just never thought anything of it, I was so young.

He carried me down the stairs.

'Where are we going?' I asked with a feeble voice.

'We can stay at my house, you dont want to stay here son'

Before we walked out the door I caught swift glance of my Mum lying covered in blood on the couch, with two huge gaping wounds on the top of her head.

I burst into tears.

He bundled me into the back seat a rusted old car, it smelled like wet dog.

He started the engine and turned to me, 'why you crying?' He asked.

'I, I, I saw Mum' I spluttered out between rapid breaths.

'Don't worry kid, Mum's just playing a prank, it's just tomato sauce!' He laughed then he turned to drive.

*I'm not 4 anymore Dad* I thought to myself.

He drove erratically through the streets, running red lights and almost crashing into a lamppost.

I prayed for blue lights to start flashing behind us, but they never came.

We arrived in some shady neighbourhood and he walked me into a house.

It smelled, there were bottles lying all over the place.

I suddenly realised the smell on his breath, it's alcohol.

We went through to one of the rooms, there were two people sleeping on the ground with crunched up foil and needles everywhere.

Someone lay on the stairs covered in vomit and there was a woman in the kitchen talking to herself.

I felt scared, these didn't seem like nice people.

The woman looked at me and smiled, she had no teeth, her skin looked all bruised.

'Never mind her kid, she's going cold turkey' my Dad laughed, and slapped her across the face.

She fell in a heap on the floor and never  made a sound.

He grabbed a beer from the fridge, which didn't appear to be on and popped it open.

He took a drink. 

'Come and see your room', He growled, beer suds soaking his matted beard.

The woman was talking to herself again on the floor shaking.

We climbed the stairs, trying our best to avoid the vomit all over the carpet.

At the end of the hall there was a closed door.

He took my hand and walked me over.

Opening the door he said, 'this is your room son...'

He stopped himself.

There was a woman sitting on top of a man, I don't know what she was doing but the man seemed to be in pain.

'Oops! Don't go in there, actually' he laughed.

'You can crash in my room kid! Just over here'.

He walked to another door that was half open.

A stained mattress lay on the floor, and a broken table stood in the corner, that was it, the room was tiny, it smelled like shit.

'It's almost 2am, we should really be getting to bed anyway' he threw a crusty blanket on the floor and rolled up a jacket for a pillow.

He came over to me pulling something out of his pocket.

Little white tablets.

'These will help you sleep!' He said, picking up a glass of water that had a cigarette butt floating in it.

'Sorry about that' he laughed, and chucked it away, it landed on my jacket pillow.

'Take them' he commanded, there were about 6 or 7.

I picked one up and put it in my mouth.

He slapped me on the face.

'I said take them, not take one!!' He yelled.

My face throbbed and felt hot.

I was shaking like a leaf.

I took the rest of them and drank them down.

He took another handful out and took them too, then he lay on his bed, or his mattress.

'What are they?' I asked.

'Valium' he said under a breath.

He fell asleep almost immediately, I don't think he even needed the pills, but now I'm worrying, is that going to happen to me?

As he turned himself around, a phone fell out of his pocket.

I immediately grabbed it and dialled 999.

It rang, I heard him groan.

The operator answered, 'Emergency services, which service do you require?'

I stayed quiet.

'Police!' I whispered.

'What the fuck? Who's there!?' My Dad growled as he sat up.

I hung up, hid the phone and lay perfectly still as he looked around the room with his eyes half closed.

He groaned again and lay back down, coughing his lungs up.

I don't know who's phone this is, if it's his or if its stolen, but I am posting on here because I dont know how much longer I have left before I pass out.

I'm too scared to phone the police again and I can feel body shutting down.

My stomach feels heavy and weak, my eyes are beginning to close.

I just want people to know, when they find my Mum, and if they find me. 

It was my Dad! 

He murdered her and took me away, I don't know where I am, but he hit me and drugged me and we are in a house full of people that look like zombies.

I dont know what will happen to me when I wake up, if I wake up.

I just want this to be known, that it was him, and his name is Arthur McKinley.

My Mum's name is Mary Bryce, and I am Adam Bryce.

If anyone sees anything about this on the news or anything, please show this or forward this to the police.

Hopefully they get to me before it's too late.

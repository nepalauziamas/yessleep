     Hi. I am Luke, age 19. My mom had divorced my dad when I was 12, and I lived with him. Ever since that day though, weird stuff happens in my sleep. I live in an urban area, covered in trees. It is a nice place, with the wind rustling the leaves, the occasional chatter outside, and the birds flying gracefully across the clear blue sky. That is, until it becomes nighttime. The place gets dark, the moonlight shines brightly in the star-filled sky. It gets dead silent during almost pitch black nights, which should be scary enough. But, for 7 years, it has gotten scarier than any normal person would even imagine.

     I still remember the first night these creepy experiences started happening. As I drifted off to sleep, I felt very strange, as if someone... or something was watching me. I decided to shrug it off, as I was worn out and tired. I had played a game of football with my friends the entire day, so I couldn't just not sleep. After I drifted into my dreams, I started seeing things. It was like a vision. I saw my house, as I was standing outside of it. Then, once I walked in, everything was trashed and ransacked. Things were burned, stolen, broken, and utterly destroyed. So, after standing in utter shock and terror, I walked up to my room... I saw myself sleeping. Tucked under my racecar covers, with my head gently resting on my soft grey pillow, was me. But there was also someone else... like some man. I got super scared.

     The next morning, I woke up drenched in sweat. My covers were laying crumpled on the floor. My dad came in, saw the scene, and we talked about what happened that night. He comforted me, hugged me, and sent me on my way to take a shower. For 7 years, this stuff just kept going on, the same old thing. Just normal nightmares, right? That's what I thought, until just 3 days ago... I was falling asleep, and a familiar feeling washed over me. I was definitely being watched... but by what? I was wide awake this time, the memories flooding back. The vivid memories of the trashed house, the man in my bed, and... the feeling of being watched... whoosh. Right into my head. I was horrified. I got up out of my bed, and decided to check around the house to see what was watching me. I open my bedroom door, and... everything was utterly ruined, just like my dream... my vision 7 years prior. I walk around the debris, tripping a few times as I go. In the backyard, there was a shadow. It was gone the moment I saw it. I started heading back to my room, and I had no idea what the hell was going on. I didn't know what was about to happen, either.

     Something was in my bed. I wasn't in it this time, just a lump under my covers. I stood there for a good 10 minutes, contemplating if I should lift the covers of get the hell out of there. Eventually, I walked towards my bed and lifted the covers. It was a pile of rotting bones. I almost threw up as the terrible odor wafted across the house. A few seconds passed, and I feel something touch my neck... a hand. I slowly turn around... it was my dad. He had gone absolutely mad. He was looking at me, horrible, angry eyes. In his other hand, there was a knife. He raised his arm, hand now firmly pressing on my shoulder, other hand ready to strike. Standing there in horror, a tear dropped down from my eye. I got out of the room, dodged my dad, and closed all of the doors in the home. I called 911. They arrived soon after. After some officers went inside the home, they exited about 7 minutes later. My dad was with them, locked up in handcuffs, yelling and screaming about how he was going to kill everyone. He was sent to a mental hospital as soon as possible. Now those bones under my bed weren't just any bones. They were parts of my mom. The skull, ribs, legs, arms, it was all there. My mom and dad never divorced. He killed her and hid the remains. Then he ransacked the place because he was planning to kill me and make his escape with the items he needed, burning the evidence. Luckily, it failed.

     3 days later, I am attending therapy. I will be for a while. It was emotionally traumatizing, watching my dad standing in front of me. He had full intentions of killing me that night. Luckily, I am safe now. I am purchasing a small apartment room about 20 miles, give or take, from my old home. I should be moving in in about a week, after I pack my stuff. At least life is turning around... let's hope it stays that way.

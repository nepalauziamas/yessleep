Hey everyone, a little background before we get started.

My name is Naissance. Weird name, I know. I’m told by my mother it’s French for  
‘birth’. I’ve always thought that was *real* original of her. Yeah, I sure was  
birthed. But enough about that.

I’ve been a huge history buff my entire life. When I was younger, I wanted to pursue
a graduate degree and become a historian, but I can’t really say I had the best
childhood and opportunities; so I had to downscale a bit. With attending college out 
of the picture considering my financial woes, I started the long, arduous road that 
is finding a good job without a degree. I ended up meeting a faculty member that
worked at a private college that was near where I lived (at a bar of all places),
and they introduced the idea of interning as an archivist’s assistant to me - I
jumped at the opportunity. Recordkeeping was a career path I had never really ever considered, nor thought about at all, but who really ever ended up doing what they
expected to do in life anyway? I figured this was adjacent enough to history. Just with a lot more organization and sitting in a dusty old storage room all day.

All things considered, I liked the job once I started working it. There was something about being a caretaker for all of these old documents and items that was really appealing. I felt like what I was doing was special; I was preserving history. Mrs. Whittinger, the head archivist and my boss, was a seasoned expert on the care of these documents. She was also very particular about the way she went about things. I was forbidden from touching anything on the shelves at the very back of the archive room, for example. Apparently, the files and things back there were in such disrepair and had so much wear that if they were moved at all they risked damage. And that was their fate, just to sit there. So when the mean old lady croaked and I succeeded her position, I was excited. I would have access to everything in the archives, and I had a lot more leeway to explore and do things my own way. That being said, something was always eerie about those dusty archives. Like there were obscured secrets waiting to be discovered. My assumption would be proven correct soon enough.

It wasn’t long before I stumbled upon those old cassette tapes. They were on the back shelf, which I had been forbidden from touching since I started working. It wasn’t too common that people came down here from the university to ask for access to the documents I safekept, but I had plenty to do. Part of my job was digitizing the physical documents and transcribing tapes. As a lot of these files preceded the internet age, this was a monumental task. There were tens of thousands of documents in these archives, and plenty more film, tape, and other media. By the time I got to that back shelf, and those tapes, it had been a little over a year since I had become the head archivist. I’m going to transcribe those tapes as I found them here, along with some afterthoughts, for reasons I will explain later. I only hope, at least, that this record of them survives long enough to be seen.

DATED: JANUARY 19TH, 1982

**\[START\]**

\[FOOTSTEPS ECHOING\]

OLD MAN: Give me a light.

\[SHUFFLING\]

YOUNG MAN: You know, you really shouldn’t smoke cigarettes. Gives you cancer and stuff.

OLD MAN: Fuck off. Don’t lecture me. I’ve been doing this longer than you’ve been alive and I turned out fine.

YOUNG MAN: Alright, alright. Just tell me what we’re doing here. I’ve never been down this way in the tunnels before.

OLD MAN: Electrical problems in the old building upstairs. \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\] —nts to repurpose it. Only problem is tunnel access from the old building got built over way back when, and the breaker is under the building. That’s why we have to take this alternate route.

YOUNG MAN: Seems like you could do that just fine by yourself. And what’s with the recorder?

OLD MAN: Yea, well. It’s an old, windy underground tunnel built a long time ago. Almost completely abandoned after  \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\] -safety measures and yada yada. \[PAUSE\]. Here, through this way. It’s dark. Get your shoulderlight.

\[CLICKING\]

OLD MAN: There’s some boards in the way.

\[BOARDS CRACK AND BREAK\]

OLD MAN: There we go. Watch your head.

\[SHUFFLING\]

YOUNG MAN: God, it’s dusty down this way. And there’s webs everywhere — Jesus!

\[WOOD RATTLES\] \[CRASH\]

YOUNG MAN: Ow, fuck! Fucking spiders. There’s planks and shit everywhere, god damnit.

OLD MAN: Watch your step. Don’t be a dumbass. I told you it was old. Get up.

\[PAUSE\] \[FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE\]

YOUNG MAN: All this to check a fucking breaker. Wouldn’t it have been easier to just \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\]?. They’ve gotta replace that shit anyway, we can’t go this way every single time.

OLD MAN: They just tell us where to go, son. It’s not on us to question it. Come on.

\[FOOTSTEPS ECHO LOUDLY\]

YOUNG MAN: Did you hear that?

\[FOOTSTEPS STOP\] \[SILENCE\]

OLD MAN: Hear what?

\[PAUSE\]

OLD MAN: I don’t hear anything. Look, if you really didn’t want to go that badly, you should’ve said something.

YOUNG MAN: No, no, seriously. You don’t hear that? It’s so loud.

\[FAINT SOUND OF WATER DRIPPING\]

OLD MAN: I really don’t. Maybe the darkness is getting to your head.

YOUNG MAN: I’m not going fucking crazy, I hear something and it’s further ahead. It sounds like screeching.

OLD MAN: So what, what do you want me to do about it. Maybe some animal wandered into here and got trapped. It’ll be fine. Stray cat or some shit. Doesn’t matter. Let’s just get to where we need to go and then we can leave.

\[YOUNG MAN SIGHS\]

YOUNG MAN: Fine, but somethings not right.

OLD MAN: Quit being paranoid. Come on, it should be just ahead.

\[FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE\]

YOUNG MAN: \[GRUNTING\] This is getting… really tight. It feels like we are in a cave right now. We have to crouch, when did the tunnel start shrinking? Are you sure this is the way?

OLD MAN: I’m sure son, this is the only way that’s blocked off from the main tunnel system. I think the ceiling foundation deteriorated to the point it’s in danger of collapsing. Be careful now.

YOUNG MAN: Seriously? Fuck this tunnel, this isn’t worth our lives.

OLD MAN: I’m not fond of it either. I’m beginning to think sending us down here was a huge oversight — But look, we're already almost there.

YOUNG MAN: Quickly, then. I’m sick of thi—

\[FAINT SCREECHING\]

\[PAUSE\]

YOUNG MAN: You hear-

OLD MAN: I heard it son. That’s no damn cat. Let’s turn back, regardless of what it is, if it sounds dangerous, we need to head back and repo— Fuck!

\[SCREECHING\]

YOUNG MAN: Let’s go! Let’s go! It’s getting closer!

\[LOUD FOOTSTEPS ECHO, RUNNING\]

OLD MAN: What? \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\] —king entrance?

YOUNG MAN: Why does it go down? Fuck fuck fuck… \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\] it wasn’t like this before…

\[LOUD SCREECHING\]

OLD MAN: Shit! Run, Al!

\[THUD, RATTLE\]

OLD MAN: Fuck, the recorder—

YOUNG MAN: It doesn’t matter, go! Go!

\[FOOTSTEPS AND VOICES TRAIL OFF\]

\[LOUD FOOTSTEPS APPROACH\]

\[LOUD SCREECHING, RATTLING\]

This tape was the first that I transcribed, and at first, I was skeptical of its nature. I figured it may have been some film student’s project or something of that nature. It was ‘fun’ and ‘inventive’ if I thought of it in that way, and surely was scary. However, upon subsequent listens, the contents of the tape started to bother me. Those screams felt all too genuine. Too real. Too guttural. Too life-threatening to be fiction. And that screeching — it wasn’t so much animal-like as it was alien. It sounded like nothing I had ever heard before. A sound like that felt like it was beyond technological capability.

That being said, I decided to do a little bit of research into this tape. The older man mentioned the name, ‘Al’, during the final moments of the audio recording. I had no way of knowing where this tape was recorded, but I did have a date, so I checked death records and missing reports on January 19th, 1982. It was a total crackshot, but to my surprise, I found an Alfurt ‘Al’ Hayward, 25, had died due to a work-related accident in Hillview, Oregon. The same town I had lived in my whole life, and the town in which I worked.

I can only assume then, that the tape is real, and was recorded here, in my hometown. This realization opened up way more questions than it answered. Who recovered the tape? What was Al’s and the older man’s actual fate? What was the thing that attacked them? It seemed like there was an old danger stirring in this sleepy town. It fascinated me. I wanted to learn more of this mysterious tape, and the subsequent ones.

Unfortunately, when I transcribed all of the audio recordings, the files got corrupted when I entered them into the university's system. I was bummed out, sure, but things like this had happened in the past. I begrudgingly rewrote the past few hours of work — only to find it corrupted again. There was something unnatural about these recordings. Forbidden. Secret. I figured I would try to log these transcripts in an alternate system, and this seemed like a safe bet. This is more of a trial run, so I’m only going to transcribe the first recording in this post. I hope nothing happens to it, or at least, that people see it before something does.

That being said, I realized something as I write this post; something that should’ve been so obvious to me before. Something I should know, living here my whole life, and as someone adept in this town’s history. Something that contradicted the validity of this first tape I transcribed:

There were no tunnels in Hillview, Oregon.

I'm a person who loves exploring places and I have been to many places outside of my country, I am a 27 year old white male born on Tampa Florida and ever since I was a kid I would go outside a lot and explore the world around me. This stuck with me until today and right now I'm living in the rural areas of the Philippines.

Like every place, you have rules to follow but this place is the weirdest among the places I've been to and I think everyone has to follow these rules when they are visiting the rural areas of the Philippines because the horrors that awaits people there are unknown.

Ever heard of the aswang? Yea....those things exist and they're even on the cities but they're not that numerous on the urban centers however things are different when we are in the rural areas where hectares of farmland can be seen with small towns and smaller houses, the luxury of the city cannot be found in the rural areas and internet connection is almost impossible.

Don't even think about how many times I tried to post this here but I really wanted to help people so that they can watch out for the dangers of rural Philippines and the rules of living here might save your lives.

The locals know pretty well and have their own rules in living in the rural countryside and all these rules are all my own and I came up with it all by myself, so here are the rules.

Rule Number 1: 
Do not camp alone in any campsite.

I live in a farm and meters away from my home is a campsite, it's a forested area with a clearing and a cold spring in the corner, not a bad place for camping but it's not a good idea to camp alone at night. Trust me the creatures of the night will come for you and even if you close your tent and there was just a camper that got eaten by a tiktik and what's left of him was just a few organs and pieces of flesh

The only law enforcement here is the garrison of the Philippine Army at the nearby town and they all know what kind of creatures dwell in the rural countryside. When the soldiers saw the remains of the camper, they took the remains and cleaned it up, everyone was watching in the site where the camper was killed

Everyone knows what killed the camper and it's the tik tik, they don't leave that much behind and they're not like the aswang that eats only the liver so that's one rule for ya, never camp alone and if you're gonna camp in this place go bring companions with you, a group of 10 campers with dogs can be enough to deter a tik tik, for good measure bring weapons with you

Rule number 2:
Do not under any circumstances go near into any body of water outside during the night

If you're wondering why, it is because of the La Llorona haunting the rivers and ponds of this place
She is a weeping woman in white dress and her long black hair covers her hideous face
The legend can be traced back to the Spanish colonial period when a woman named Feliza Cruz Llantos y Garcia, she was a beautiful woman who married a soldier of the Spanish army and she was also known for her infidelity and when this was discovered by her husband, he beat her up badly and slit her face carving a hideous smile.

He also took her eyes off and broke her jaw, he then threw her body into the river and so the legend was born, every night after the gruesome thing that happened to her sightings of a woman weeping in the river and then a few disappearances of children playing at the rivers at night

I personally saw La Llorona but I didn't come close to being her victim because of the rosary I carry everyday but the same cannot be said for the case of Juan who's a farmer I know

Well he usually poops on the river because he has no comfort room, it's pretty common here but the rule states the obvious and what happened was Pedro feeling the urge to poop and having no bathroom or toilet left him no choice but to poop on the river and given that La Llorona haunts these rivers

Juan was never seen again, I personally didn't see him get dragged down the river but there are screams heard that night and after that came nothing but silence, the day after it happened Juan was never seen alive again

The soldiers eventually found his corpse floating on the river about 50 kilometers away from his home and his eyes are missing along with his tongue and his body is bloated and coming out from his body is a dark liquid that smells bad
We offered prayers for Juan and no one comes near the springs or the river at night fearing that La Llorona will take them 

Some brave souls go out at night but they go with protection, some carry rosaries on their pockets and some carry medallions of witchcraft and both works in deterring La Llorona.

Rule number 3:
Do not leave your windows open at night 

Well it's for obvious reasons, to keep you safe from other people but most importantly is to keep you safe from the Manananggal

The Manananggal is a type of aswang that flies
At day the Manananggal takes the form of a normal girl but at night the manananggal changes form as these things turn into half bodied creatures with wings leaving the lower body behind with the creature flying around the sky wit it's torso only 

They usually search for pregnant women but also take down people if given the opportunity, do not open your windows at night, they can be killed with guns and other weapons but they're mostly elusive and only attacks unsuspecting victims

There was a house just 30 minutes away from me that left their windows open, what happened next was a manananggal killing one of them but it resulted in the Manananggal getting caught and killed afterwards, it drew attention from the people and the creature got killed

So far these are the only rules I came up with, I will update you all if something new comes and as always stay safe y'all

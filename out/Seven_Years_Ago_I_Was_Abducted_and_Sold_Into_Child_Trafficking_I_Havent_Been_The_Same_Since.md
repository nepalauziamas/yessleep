Tw: Child abuse

….

I don’t have a name. 

Well that’s untrue, I suppose we all have names. Plus, I do actually have a name, had several in fact, it’s just that I don’t remember the one I was given at birth.

Most of my early childhood is a blur, and most of the things I do remember are unimportant. I’d say that one of the only really important things that stuck was that I grew up in an orphanage. My therapist said my brain most likely blocked the rest out as a sort of trauma response, but it’s whatever. 

I know you didn’t come here to read about my early childhood, you came here to read about my pain and the time I spent being trafficked. 

It’s okay, I know you all mean well. I haven’t taken any offense to it. Believe me when I say I couldn’t even if I wanted to. 

It’s not like any of this will matter to me soon anyway- this is sort of my suicide note for the world (my adoptive parents will be getting a different one) if you haven’t caught on by now. 

Scratch that, nothing has mattered to me since the night I, the real and authentic me, died three years ago. 


Let me explain:

Seven years ago I was abducted and sold into child trafficking.

As I mentioned earlier I was raised in an orphanage, a place where most unwanted children go. 

A yard full of kids that nobody would miss was practically prime real estate for my traffickers. 

I remember that before I was taken, a few kids from the orphanage would go missing every now and then. My caretakers didn’t really care though since it was a few less mouths to feed and take care of. 

All these years later, I wonder if the two parties had an unspoken agreement. 

Anyway, the memory of my kidnapping is crystal clear. One of the few memories from before that are. 

I was friends with this one girl, we were more like acquaintances in reality. Her name escapes me. 

She was short, really chubby, but overall cute looking. Her curly blonde hair framed her freckle-filled face nicely and her blue eyes sparkled when ever she saw icecream. She was pretty and knew how to use it. She’d flirt with the boys and they’d give her their food or whatever sweet treat they managed to get their hands on to win her favor. She was really snooty about it too, but I guess her only downfall was food and some egotistical issues.

It was mid afternoon. I remember the humidity and feeling like a melting popsicle. 

I had longed to be inside with the functioning A/C but our caretakers were forcing us to spend time outside in the yard. Blondie and I were hogging the swings- most likely trying to cool down with the breeze generated from swinging up and down- when we heard that little tune that comes from icecream trucks coming up the road. 

Blondie squealed with delight as she launched herself off her swing. She flipped like an acrobat and landed like a ninja on the wood tan chips before she sprinted away. A few other kids rushed off in the same direction as her with their hands shoved in their pockets looking for loose change. We would get a few quarters in exchange for doing chores here and there, so that’s how us sugar deprived children managed to pay for icecream and other treats. 

The two girls who were waiting for us to vacate the swings sighed with relief once Blondie left. One of them took her seat while the other stared at me expectantly as I swayed slowly. 

She let out a frustrated grunt when she realized I wasn’t going to move and started to push her buddy. It was hot out and icecream did sound tempting, but I think I was saving up for a book at the time. 

Blondie had come back sobbing as the vanilla swirl in her hand started to melt. For some context, towards the back of the orphanage had some heavy foliage as I think the place was by some secluded woodland. Perfect area to be taken am I right? 

Blondie had said that as she was on her way back to the swings she kicked the soccer ball a group of boys were playing with and it went behind said foliage and they got mad and started to yell at her. She didn’t want to get anything in her icecream so she asked me to go get the ball for her. I remember telling her that I’d hold her food for her so she could retrieve the ball, but she refused to part with it. With a huff and a sigh I marched my little butt over to where she pointed to where soccer ball supposedly landed. I don’t remember ever seeing a soccer ball fly over there but mini me must’ve thought nothing of it. 

I was grabbed when I broke through the tree line. As I struggled to get out of the mans grasp as he dragged me away, I remember being able to see a glimpse of the yard. There, standing by the swings, I saw Blondie happily licking her ice cream. Everything clicked when I was thrown into the back of the freezer part of the icecream truck. 

Blondie must’ve unknowingly traded me for free icecream. That’s the only plausible explanation I can really think of anyway. Like I wrote earlier, the girl really liked her icecream. 

The thing that I like to think kept me going during that time was that my traffickers wanted me. Sure it was for nefarious purposes, but they picked me out of a crowd of kids and lured me away, not another girl like Blondie. Deep down, behind the feelings of terror and shock, there was honestly hope. 

That was when I was still an innocent little shit and thought the world was all magic and rainbows. 

It’s sad, but coming from someone who grew up in a place with unwanted people and feeling unwanted myself, it was a nice feeling to have. I miss that feeling. 

The ride in the back of the icecream truck was long and I was freezing. To pass the time I took in my surroundings. The man that took me was sitting on one of the freezer chests that housed the the delectable desserts inside. His eyes were pinned on me, making sure I didn’t try anything. He was dressed in all black sweater and pants. Adorned on his face was a balaclava. His hand rested on his hip and on top of his gun holster.

I was old enough to know what was happening to me and what a gun was. I was ten at the time, I’m seventeen now. That image of the gun and what his stance was implying is burned into the back of my eyelids. 

For most of the ride I stared at the little menu board and memorized the options. Repeating all of the different flavors and types of treats in my head managed to calm me down.

My kidnapper was rough with me once the vehicle arrived to wherever we were. He stuck a black bag on my head and bound my hands behind my back with zip ties. I was physically kicked out of the back of the truck and landed on my face. A new type of terror rushed through my veins as I fell and had no idea how long I’d be falling for. In reality it took like half a second for my face to meet the ground, but it felt like an eternity in the moment.

I was then ripped up off the ground by my hair and to my feet where I was then pressed forward. My eyes were watering at this point from the pain in my head and scalp, but I did my best to keep my composure. Something told me that if I cried like a baby I’d provoke him into full on beating me up. 

After what felt like centuries, we had finally stopped and the bag on my head was removed. I was then pushed forward for one the last time. The room was dim and the walls were white and bare. There was a table in front of me, behind it sat a tall tan skinned man. He had a nice suit on, his hands where clasped together on top of the table, and a big smile was plastered on his face. His whole aura was intimidating and I found myself shaking and sniffling. A glance behind him showed a few more girls huddled together in the corner. Silent whimpers and cries rang out throughout the small room. 

My body shivered as I felt his gaze look over every inch of me. 

“Tsk, tsk, tsk.” He said aloud after he had finished his visual assessment of me. 

His words were laced with anger,“ She’s too visibly damaged. We’ll have to wait for her bruises to heal. She’ll have to be apart of the next harvest.” 

He sprung up from his chair and slammed his hands on the table. I flinched as the sudden burst of noise startled me. His footsteps approached rapidly as I braced for whatever he was going to do to me. When his footsteps passed me, I looked behind me to see where he was going. 

“I told you to not be so rough with the merchandise!” A loud smack echoed through the space as the man in the suits fist connected with my kidnappers masked face.

“Now I’ll be one short for this harvest, and you know how I don’t like to loose out on my money. Get him out of here.” 

Two men who I hadn’t seen before dragged my pleading kidnapper out of the door behind me as the suited man went back to his desk. A collective shudder surfed through the cluster of girls in the back of the room as they watched the man come closer to them. 

“Sorry about that sweetie.” He said in a sickly sweet voice as he sat back down and collected himself. “Do not fret, everything will be just fine in due time.”

“If I let you out of those bindings, you’ll be a good girl and not run away, right?”

I shook my head vigorously in response.

He got up once more and walked behind me. I felt the pressure on my wrists lessen as he cut the zip ties. 

I heard him mutter,” these wounds are going to take a while to heal.”

Once he finished cutting my bindings he stood in front of me and placed his large hands on my shoulders. “There, all better?”

I nodded my head yes again. 

“Hi there, I’m Fuego.” The man in the suit said, introducing himself, after taking a step back and sticking his hand out. 

I hesitated to shake it, but once I motioned my arm he took my hand and shook it firmly. 

“Ah, I see you’re a quiet one.” Fuego said with that same sinister smile he flashed earlier.

I swallowed a lump that had formed in my throat. A second of silence passed before he had spoken again. This time he placed his hand gently on my back and guided me through the door, away from the other girls. 

“You’re a good and ripe apple, I can tell already.” 

We walked through what looked like an abandoned office building. Fuego led me past a bunch of deserted cubicles and into another room. It was smaller than the last and there was a bathroom attached. 

“You’ll wait here until I come and get you again.” Fuego instructed before leaving. 

The walls were white and there was blue carpet flooring- kinda like the ones you’d find in a school library or something. There was a singular dark wooden door and no windows or anything hanging on the walls. I tried to open the door after Fuego left but it wouldn’t budge. Must’ve been locked from the outside. A small mattress with a thin looking blanket and pillow laid in the corner. I took a glance at my stinging wrists only to find deep red indents on my skin. No blood was drawn but I figured they’d bruise nicely. I made my way into the bathroom to explore. Thankfully there was a toilet, a small sink, and mirror. It took me a second to work up the courage but I eventually went and looked into the mirror to see the “damage” that was done to me during transit. 

I had a nice looking welt in the middle of my forehead from when I face planted earlier. It looked like I’d have a black eye too as bruising had begun to form on my left eyelid. I took in my disheveled appearance. My head had scraggly brown wisps of hair standing in up in different angles from the bag being placed on and ripped off of my head. Chocolate brown eyes stared back at me, fright swirled all around in them. After taking in a deep breath I ended up leaving the room.

For the first time I let myself cry since I had been ‘napped. I huddled myself into the corner on the mattress and silently sobbed until sleep graced me with its presence and overcame me. 

I have no idea how long I was in that room for. Every once in a while someone would come and bring me food and water, sometimes a change of clothes. Fuego came a few times, just to look me over. He put some kind of ointment on my wrists and bandaged them up for me and would come to check on my healing process. 

I had nightmares about what the “harvest” entailed. 

I remember thinking that maybe I’d be chopped into itty bitty little pieces and then my body parts would be shipped all over the world for some deranged cannibal to eat. Or maybe my organs would be sold on the black market. My imagination had ran rampant in those days.

When Fuego came to me and let me out of that dingy little room, I knew I’d find out my fate soon enough. 

You can’t imagine how confused I was when he took me to a coat closet where a bunch of white laced dresses were hung up. 

“Pick one that’s in your size.” He commanded calmly. 

I did as he said. Except for the color and lace, the dresses were all different. Some had sleeves while others didn’t. Some had a two piece appearance while others didn’t. The dresses were all different lengths too. I ended up picking a thick strapped pleated dress that had a ribbon tied around the waist separating the smooth top from the pleated bottom. The silky fabric went down a little past my knees.

Fuego smiled approvingly as he led me into another room across from the coat closet. There were two long tables with all different types of flowers lined on top of them. I counted twenty four in total. 

I watched as Fuego slowly moved in the middle of both the tables. His gaze scanning each and every colorful petal and pointy stem.

“Ah.” He said stopping abruptly. “This suits you perfectly.”

He walked back towards me with purpose as I saw the flower he picked out in his hand. It was a little yellow daisy.

Fuego brought his hand up to my cheek and looked me in the eyes as he held the flower up to me before moving some of my hair behind my ear. 

“Your name is Daisy now, understand?” He then placed the flower behind my ear. I saw flashes of the yellow petals in my peripheral vision.

I nodded my head slowly as it took all my willpower not to cry. I remember a feeling of sadness welling up within me because in that moment I understood. Fuego was stripping me of my name, my identity, who I was as a person, for his harvest. 

“That’s my good little Daisy.” He said as he rubbed my back before leading me out of the room. 

Fuego brought me into a small bathroom. There was a package of baby wipes and a hairbrush on the counter. He nudged me gently inside. 

“Clean yourself up and make yourself all pretty. I’ll be waiting.” He had said that last part lowly, implying that I shouldn’t waste time or try anything funny. 

I quickly took the flower off and the gray t-shirt and sweatpants I was wearing before opening the package of baby wipes. The scent of artificial coconut filled the air. I started rubbing my skin gently with the wipes all over. My face, armpits, neck, everywhere. My damp skin smelled like a mix of coconut and sweat when I was finished. This was closest thing I’d had to a shower in that time so it would have to do. 

The dress fit me nicely and was very pretty I had to admit. It took me a while to brush through the knots that had tangled in my hair but I eventually finished. I styled a little side sweep bang to add something. A lump formed in my throat as my gaze caught the yellow daisy sitting on the counter. I jumped when a soft knock came from the door. I quickly placed the flower behind my ear and opened the bathroom door. 

Fuego smiled once he saw me. “Very good. I have high hopes for you.”

He then grabbed my hand and stuck a needle in my arm. I felt a cold liquid enter under my skin as it began to burn. My vision faded out and I remember feeling very scared. Scared that I wouldn’t wake up ever again. 

I was sadly wrong.

I came to on a cold hard concrete floor. I was shocked to find that there were other girls lined up next to me in a straight line. We were all chained together by our wrists. Some of these girls looked to be half my age, some looked to be double. A few girls were still knocked out. Some were praying, others were crying. I noticed they all had flowers tucked behind their ears. I counted twenty four of us in all. 

There were guards in front of us that were carrying what I now know are assault rifles. They kept jamming the butt of their guns into the shoulders of the girls that were crying loudly. It took everything not to pee myself out of fright. 

It didn’t take long for everyone else to wake up. When we were conscious enough we all looked at each other, but nobody spoke a word. Too afraid of what would happen if we did. So we were all silent. Silently talking amongst ourselves, silently praying, silently pleading to whatever higher power there was for the least horrible outcome. 

The sound of a door opening echoed in the distance and multiple sets of footsteps followed. 

We were in some kind of warehouse or storage facility. There were two or three black cars that sat in front of a large closed garage door about twenty feet in front of us. I’m assuming that’s how they brought us girls there.

“Sit on your knees! Eyes forward!” The guards ordered suddenly in whisper yells.

They jabbed and poked at everyone not moving fast enough. Eventually all of us girls were sitting in a uniform position. There were many who still hadn’t gained their composure though, and as the footsteps got louder so did the sobs. 

“Welcome gentleman to this months harvest!” Fuego boomed with delight as he and several other men entered my line of sight. 

There were many a murmur that came from the small crowd of men. They were all wearing fancy suits, similar to the one Fuego was wearing the day I met him. The men differed in size, shape and age. 

I brought my gaze to the ground as the men started to roam about and look at their options.  I had the “if I can’t see them they can’t see me” mentality. 

Cold hard metal made contact with my chin as my head was forced up. A sharp pain exploded in my jaw.

“Face forward!” One of the guards said menacingly to me. 

I didn’t dare move my head down again as I tried to tune out the silent sobs and “no’s” coming from besides me. 

Eventually Fuego and this younger looking man approached me. He had short brown hair and green eyes. He must’ve been in his late twenties or early thirties. I distinctly remember his blue bow tie for some reason.

He looked down upon me as he scanned over my body. He got down on his knees and to my level. I shuddered as he lifted his fingers towards my ear. A tear slipped out when he began to caress the side of face. He played with my hair for a bit before getting back up. 

“What’s her name?” The man said, his voice being deeper than I expected. It was crisp as an apple and smooth like butter. 

“Daisy. She’s a good little girl isn’t she?” Fuego said smoothly. 

“Yes, yes she is. She’s a good little Daisy. I think I’ll take her.” 

My heart sank at his words. I desperately looked to Fuego but as the man took out his wallet I saw pure greed and evil in Fuego’s eyes. I don’t know why I felt so betrayed in that moment. I knew from the get go that he was bad, but it must’ve been his gentleness and the way he spoke that got me thinking otherwise.

“No.” I whispered softly as Fuego unlocked the chain that connected me to the person on my right. My whispers fell on deaf ears as I kept saying no as he unbound me. I was forcefully picked up and carried towards the garage door. I tried to squirm my way out the young mans grasp as the metallic door slowly opened. 

There were a bunch of cars waiting outside the garage door. It was dark out and raining, and there were too many cars to count. A driver exited one of the cars and opened the back door. The man gently placed me in the backseat and quickly closed the door before I could try to get out. The sound of the door lock clicking filled the cabin. A second later the man entered and sat in the front passenger seat a glass window separated the driver’s seat and shotgun from the back seats.

I watched in horror as other drivers exited their vehicles to open doors for the other girls who were sold off too. They were screaming and kicking, trying to fight to get away, but just like me, none of them succeeded. 

I remember feeling a deep pit of despair forming in my stomach as the car started to drive away. I crunched myself up into a ball in the back seat and cried into my dress. 

We had driven in silence for a while before the man spoke up out of the blue.

“I haven’t told you my name yet, have I?”

I stayed curled up, my eyes burning holes into the fancy leather that lined the seat. 

“My name is Richard. Richard Ubanks. It’s nice to meet you, Daisy.” 

When I didn’t respond he kept the one sided conversation going.

“I understand how you must be feeling right now, but I promise you it’s not as bad as you think.” 

A scoff escaped passed my lips. 

“She’s alive!” Richard yelled crazily. 

I rolled my eyes in response. 

Some time passed before he spoke again,“ You probably already figured it out by now, but I’m rich.”

“Richard The Rich” I mumbled out sarcastically.

“Exactly! You are quite the funny one. I knew I was right to choose you.”

I shuddered at the word choose. 

“Now, the truth is Daisy, I’ve adopted you.” He said bluntly.

“What?” I questioned as I unfurled myself out of my ball form.

“That’s right!” He said with a laugh as he turned around and smiled at me. “You are now my daughter!”

“Adopted? B-but I saw you hand cash over to Fuego.” I stumbled out, confused.

“You did indeed! You see Daisy, adopting a child is similar to adopting a puppy. You have to pay a little bit of money for the doggie, and I paid a little bit of money for you.” 

“T-the chains..”

“Ah yes, I rescued you from those bad men. Isn’t that right Arnold?” Richard turned to his driver, who I assumed was Arnold. 

A long moment passed before Arnold let out a soft “Yes. Yes that’s right.” 

Arnold looked like he was about to shit a brick. 

“Chin up kiddo. Things are looking up for you! There’s a nice big room waiting for you when we get home. You’re going to have all the prettiest clothing, all the toys you could ever dream of, and so much more, my love.” Richard said excitedly.

A spark lit up in my chest as he talked about all the things we were going to do. In retrospect it’s pretty easy to convince a ten year old they’re safe when you bribe them with toys and sweets and such. But what really sold me in the moment was the way seemed genuinely happy and it made all the bad feelings I had melt away. 

We had even stopped for food and after finishing my happy meal, I opened up more to Richard.

I indulged him with my time at the orphanage while playing with the little toy that came with my meal and he payed attention the whole time. He payed attention to me. He responded to me, listened to me, asked about my thoughts and feelings. Nobody had really payed that much attention to me before, and I had felt seen for the first time in a long time. 

Richard laughed with glee when he saw my reaction to seeing his house. It was quite literally a mansion. There was a giant fountain with a stone dolphin statue in the middle spewing water out of its blowhole. The architecture was absolutely magnificent and the house was so big and pretty. My heart filled with excitement when the car stopped and Arnold let me out.

This was real, this was my house. My home. 

I eagerly took Richards hand as he led me up the driveway towards his home. The smell of petrichor filled my nostrils and I had become giddy with glee. 

Things were finally looking up for me.

My heart sank into my stomach when he pulled me away from the steps that led to his front door.

“W-where are we going?” I asked frantically. His grasp on my hand tightened as we neared a gate on the side of the mansion.

“To your room, my dear.” 

He led me into his backyard. There was an Olympic sized swimming pool filled with crystal clear chlorine rich water. There were lounge chairs and a nice patio set next to the pool. The whole space was bougie looking.  

A few yards away sat a decent sized pool shed. I felt like I was going to throw up when I saw the pad lock and chains wrapped around doors sheds door handles.

“No, no please!” I begged as he dug the keys out of his pocket. I was trying to pull away from him, but my ten year old strength was no match for his.

Once he managed to get the door open he shoved me in. 

“B-but you said!” I cried out as I tried to push open the door. 

I felt the light in my chest go out when I heard the lock click back into place. 

“Don’t worry darling.” Richard said menacingly. “Daddy will be back soon for playtime.” 

My ears started ringing and my head was spinning. My chest was tight and heavy. It was hard to breathe. It was in that moment I realized had lured me into a false sense of security and gave me hope, then snuffed it out when he had the chance.

What kind of monster buys a little girl and makes her think he adopted her, only to throw her in his pool shed? Richard, that’s who. 

I didn’t know it then, but that would be the night when my innocence was taken from me.

I can’t pinpoint exactly when my fiancé died.

I’m fairly certain it was after I found the teeth in his nightstand, but before the thing had emerged out of his body, which had split like rotten fruit before my eyes.

\_\_

He was exhausted when I picked him up from the airport, at the time I thought he was just worn out from the conference and the five-hour flight. He mentioned he may have picked up a bug, that he was feeling a bit ‘off’.

Before bed, we talked as I finished some work at the kitchen table, about the upcoming wedding, and how we planned to take some time off soon to just spend time together at home and not worry about anything else. He eventually had to turn in early, he was just so worn out. He rested his forehead against mine for a moment, before he kissed me goodnight.

Aaron tossed and turned all night that first night.

I’m a light sleeper, so I was awake while he groaned throughout the night, muttered to himself. He eventually got up, and stared into space in the kitchen, doubled over in pain. I couldn’t sleep either so we sat up together and I made him some hot tea – I felt so bad for him.

He was gone that next morning. He wrote me a note that he decided to leave for work early, to see if he could get a doctor’s appointment in the afternoon. I noticed an odd smell in the bedroom after he left that morning. I couldn’t locate the source until I checked his side of the bed, the sheets were oily, brownish, and smelled sickly sweet.

He said the doctor was perplexed but took blood and ordered some tests. He looked weak as we watched TV together, he grimaced as he tried to fight through the pain and find a comfortable position.

The next night was even more restless. In addition to tossing and turning, he at one point rolled close to my face, breathing fetid breath only inches away. I gagged and had to roll away from him.

He and I both became sleep deprived over the next couple of days.

At one point, I looked in the nightstand when I had cleaned the sheets again but still couldn’t locate the source of the smell. I didn’t know what I was expecting, but I was surprised to find several teeth, root and all.

No matter how many times he showered, the smell followed him – we started doing laundry daily. When we left our home in the warmth of the summer sun, beads of brown sweat rolled down his face.

The smell was like a long-term uninvited guest that we both became very acquainted with, it filled the house and seeped into the walls and fabric. Nothing we did could reduce or get rid of it. I finally made the connection, too. He smelled like when a rat had gotten trapped somewhere in the garage last year and died. He smelled like death.

He became so sick that he had to miss a week of work.

I called his coworker and friend, Jorge, and asked if anything unusual had happened at the conference. Did Aaron eat anything odd or sit next to someone sick on the plane? He said no one else seemed sick, and that they ate almost the exact same meals, except on the last night. He said there was some sort of sweet-smelling dessert with a black sauce that hadn’t been on the menu but was served to the attendees. Aaron ate it but Jorge hadn’t. One of Jorge’s meetings had run long that day and the dish was so popular that they ran out and wouldn’t let Aaron grab a second dish for him – people were literally going crazy for it.

Meanwhile, Aaron’s condition continued to worsen. He was in so much pain that he could barely get out of bed, he refused to eat and his skin looked loose, almost. He wouldn’t let me take him to the hospital, he was convinced he was almost through it.

I guess in a way, he was...

By the end of that awful week, his condition began to vastly improve. The smell changed too – he smelled less like death and more like... fruit that’s gone bad. He was full of energy and said the pain was gone. He could get out of bed and eat normal food again.

He still seemed a bit delirious at times and sometimes said things that made no sense – at one point he laughed before leaning in to whisper wetly into my hear, “He’s gone now, every last bite.”, but overall it was a huge improvement.

However, it seemed like the better he got, the more he changed. His formerly gentle smiles turned to smug grins, like he was the only one in on the world’s best joke. At one point, I teased him, asking what he knew that I didn’t.

“You’ll see, soon enough, once I’m ready.” He smiled at me with his blackened gums, his voice sounded wet, guttural, since his recovery, like it was being forced through anatomy no longer meant for human speech.

That night, he had rested his forehead against mine, but instead of our usual goodnights, he whispered, “I’m going to watch them eat you from the inside, out”

He had changed so much, so fast. He had become cruel and aggressive, which was a departure from his usual kind and loving nature. He often sneered at me through sunken eyes when I said his name – as if he was mocking me. His sense of humor seemed to fade away along with the illness. He seemed like a different person. He used to be patient and sweet, but now in even a simple conversation, or inquiries about his health, he only gave me condescending or aggressive responses.

The last night before he was totally gone, he made us a dessert. It was beautiful, I had never seen anything like it, but it reminded me of the dessert Jorge had described from the conference that got him sick in the first place. I gently declined to eat and that sent him into a flying rage – he lunged at me, but one benefit of the liquid now constantly seeping out from his pores meant that I could slip through his grasp easily. I locked myself in the bathroom.

I think that was the moment, although I didn’t fully understand at the time, that I realized my fiancé was truly gone.

The next day at work, I made plans to stay with my mother without telling him. When I got home, I discretely packed a suitcase and loaded it into my car; I planned to leave when he fell asleep. At the time, I vaguely wondered if he was trying to poison me and decided not to eat any meals at home after that.

That final night, over dinner, we sat in silence as he ate, and I moved my food around the plate with my fork. As he chewed with what was left of his teeth, he stared at me, hungrily as he licked his lips with a blackened tongue.

He paused, to reach back into his mouth, and pulled, ever so lightly. He placed a molar on the table between us. He never broke eye contact as he continued to slowly remove the few remaining teeth he had left and placed them on the table. He smiled – which was infinitely more disturbing with the last of his teeth gone. He cocked his head at me, as if daring me to ask him something. As we stared at each other, I noticed that the whites of his eyes had started to turn brown at the edges.

It hurt, seeing him like this. It was like someone else had taken Aaron's body for a test drive and totaled it.

I planed on leaving that night when he went to bed, but he never did. Instead, he paced back and forth, back and forth, barefoot, leaving greasy footprints on the wooden floor while making a faint squelching sound as he walked. I watched him warily as I sat up with a book in my lap. There was no way I was planning to close my eyes or turn my back on him.

Finally, in the early morning hours, he turned to me, that putrid smile on his face visible in the bright moonlight. He began moving erratically, tensing up and making strange repetitive motions. The last remaining semblance of what had been my loving fiancé, his skin, began to melt away like tissue paper in the rain.

I bolted up out of bed and slowly backed away towards the door as something new, different, became visible as the last remnants of skin melted away. Its face was obscured by a foul-smelling brown haze that emanated from it, and I couldn't force myself to look more closely. I had seen enough terrible things that week to last me a lifetime already, and the glimpses of its somewhat human-esque, but distorted anatomy that I did catch did not leave me wanting to see more.

I slammed our bedroom door behind me, but it began to ooze from under the door jamb. I ran down the stairs several steps at a time, and the wet footsteps headed slowly in my direction as I grabbed my purse and keys. As I ran shoeless in my pajamas, towards the car it called out to me in that deep, wet voice, tauntingly, “Farah, don’t you want to see what I’ve become?”

I can’t stop thinking about what Jorge said about the blackish, sweet-smelling dessert that was so popular at the conference that they had run out of it. I keep thinking about the attendees that had been from all over the world, and I wonder what happened to them.

I saw slick brown footprints in the parking lot of my mom’s apartment today. Too small to be Aaron’s.

Have you ever met the Rot Man? Because I imagine that if you haven’t, you will soon.

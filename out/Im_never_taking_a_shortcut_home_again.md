I'm typing this from my bed, finally safe and fucking sound. Though I don't think I'll get enough sleep, it's good to know that you're in your own bed, all doors locked and the most important thing; on the fourth floor.

It was the same evening as any. I kissed my boyfriend goodbye, he told me to text him when I come home, I unlocked my bike and went on my merry way. Driving through the early summer evening, I enjoyed the lukewarm night and the soft quacks of the ducks getting ready to sleep on the riverside left of my path. I got off of my bike to push it up the stairs on the pedestrian path right next to a highway that shortened my trip home for like five minutes.

Now, my town is usually quite peaceful. I mean there are some shady people doing some shady stuff and, during evenings, there are few sick bastards trying to molest women and initiate fights with other more normal guys. Other than that, things are pretty chill. We're famous for being a hometown of a certain beer, and even though everybody drinks a lot, nobody drinks that beer other than tourists because it's fucking shit. What can I say, Slavs, right?

That evening I was completely sober, not tired at all because I got a good night's sleep and I have no history of any mental illnesses. I'm mentioning this so you could understand  that the thing that happened to me wasn't the fruit of my imagination, booze or anything else.

So, as I climbed up the stairs, I looked left of me, down the road, and saw a silhouette of a guy walking his dog. A small annoying breed, with a specific annoying bark. Nothing strange, I mean people have to walk their dogs. I hopped on my bike, and took another look behind me just in case there's another cyclist going my way. I wish I never looked back and just drove straight home, no matter whether I crashed into someone else or not. 

The guy that was walking his dog was standing, facing towards me, dog nowhere to be seen. His arms were raised up, facing the sky, palms open at a broken angle from the outside towards the ground. Even though it was disturbing, what fucked me up the most is that his arms were long as shit. And I don't mean a normal person having arms a bit more longer than usual people do long, I mean two meter long arms, fucking praying mantis style long. 

He let out a terrifying, guttural scream that shouldn't have been able to be so loud considering the distance that was between us. It sounded like he was right next to my ear, and the scream itself was anything but human. When he started running in my direction, arms still fucked up, needles to say I wasn't going to do any brave horror movie shit and just started driving my bike fast as hell. 

Few meters before I'd reached the stairs to my neighborhood, I stupidly looked right of me. Like I've never watched a movie, or read a story from r/nosleep in my life. The guy, thing, I don't have a fucking clue as to what to call it, was right next to me, same speed as mine even though it looked like it wasn't running at all. It's face...well, to say at least, made me shit myself. 

His body was facing forward, while its face was turned so it looked directly at me, which is impossible unless you break your neck, considering the positions we were in. But, again, even though it was fucking disturbing, what fucked me up the most was its expression. His eyes were lifeless, as if they're were looking straight through me, and its mouth turned into ear to ear grin. And I don't mean a big smile, I mean literally. Fucking. Ear. To. Ear. 

His mouth spread so wide you weren't able to see its chin, and the teeth were fucking disgusting. It wasn't the classical monster sharp ones, but rather the age old alcoholic, chain-smoking type of person. Few of them missing, leaving the others dark, barely hanging, and with a breath that could fucking kill. I got scared shitless and lost the control of my bike, crashing like a little bitch, and finally passing out.

When I woke up and got to my senses, which seemed like ages but was probably a few minutes, I was alone and my everything was hurting. I fucked up my knees and my elbows pretty badly and my cheek wasn't doing so well either. I somehow got up from the ground and pushed my bike down the stairs, limping and bleeding as I did, looking around me for the thing that made me get all fucked up like this. 

When I got home safely, ignoring all the twitching street lights and the twitching building lights, I decided to write this shit down. Even though I got a good night's sleep, I'm so tired right now. My eyes are shutting down even though I'm quite scared. I think I'm going to go to sleep and I hope I will wake up alive. 

My knees and elbows are hurting like hell and I can't shake this feeling that I'm being watched, even though I live on the fourth floor. 

Good night people, wish me luck.

EDIT: I'm hearing a really familiar bark from the dog park behind my building and I think the best thing to do is to cover myself with a blanket over my head, try real hard to fall asleep and come back here in the morning.

My dog died a couple years back, and I always love seeing photos of her. It reminded me of good times. However, last night I went into the attic to look for something. But my eye caught onto an old, rusty photo film in a box at the corner of the attic. Curiosity got the best of me and I went towards it to see what it was. It was.. my dog? I've never seen this photo before, no matter how many times I've been up here, I haven't seen this photo anywhere. Perhaps I just never noticed it before, but I was definitely confused at first.

But I just brushed it off and kept with me as a fond memory. I went to bed and put the picture onto my nightstand, but when I looked at it again before going to sleep, it looked.. different. I know when you're in the dark your mind plays tricks on you but it felt weird. I was too close and it couldn't have changed so much if it was just my mind. Instead of my cute dog it was gory. Bloody and gory. My dog was on the ground dead, with bugs crawling over its eye, flies buzzing around, her insides were out, as if it was taken out within mere seconds. It was in the exact same place, just a terrifying and traumatizing difference between my dog, and whatever that horrific sight was. My hand jerked over to the film and faced it down so I wouldn't have to see it anymore. I tried my best to fall asleep but I couldn't stop thinking about it. My dog was put to sleep, not.. killed. Was this some kind of trick? Was this a mind game? How would I have known? I eventually went to sleep, but I had a nightmare I will NEVER forget.

It started with me back when I was a child, I didn't have a great memory of it, but I knew where I was. Everything was going normal when suddenly my dog had to go to the "vet". At the time I didn't think much of it, but I did notice that he had taken a polaroid with him. I decided to take a look out the window but my mom stopped me and tried to distract me. I managed to catch a glimpse of what was outside, It was horrid. The most traumatizing site you could ever imagine. My dad was gutting my dog and taking her guts out. I let out a huge gasp, I looked behind me in an instant and my mom was looking down at me with a face you could only describe as "You weren't supposed to see that.". I didn't know what to do so I turned back to the window and my dad was right there. Holding up my dead dog, right against it. I woke up in a panic, sweating continuously, I jerked my head to the side and the film was facing directly at me. But not the dog, not the dead dog, but a face. My fathers face.

He had the same face as he did in the window, staring at me. Except he wasn't holding the dog this time. I backed myself up against the wall attempting to pinch myself, to try and wake up. It wasn't working. I should of trusted my gut the moment I saw that filthy film. Could it be true? Is that what happened all those years ago? Was this all some LIE?! But WHY. WHY would they do that to her. She was an amazing dog, she didn't deserve that.. why would they do that? WHY WHY WHY!??! Why couldn't they have just put her down??

Did I.. I gagged at the thought. Did I EAT HER?? Did he use her guts and flesh to feed us?? I cried there. Hugging my knees and just cried. I cried silently, but not silent enough.. my mom came in asking what's wrong, I hesitantly pointed to the film, and a shockwave of panic came through me, what was my mom gonna do to me now that I found out?? But it was gone, the film was gone?! As if it was never there, as if it never existed. I gasped and continued to cry, wondering if it was all true, wondering everything I just went through, is it real? Am I living with maniacs? I didn't know what to do. my mom shushed me to bed and I fell asleep. I woke up again at about 3:22AM. My eyes opened to that same polaroid, right over me. It was my dad, the same face, everything. He was THERE. He was holding a knife towards me, I screamed bloody Mary as if I was being chased by 400 zombies.

My mom ran in but he wasn't there anymore. What was wrong with me? Was I going crazy? I debated on burning the film the next morning, but I didn't know where it was. For all I know, It could be going to someone else, to show them the truth next.

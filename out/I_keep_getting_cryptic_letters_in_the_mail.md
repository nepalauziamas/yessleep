About two weeks ago I was coming home from a dinner I had with some friends. I live in an apartment so each resident has their own small mailbox on the first floor. I’ve been penpalling for about 4 years now, so it’s a habit of mine to always check my mailbox when coming home to my apartment. When I looked inside, I had some bills along with a letter in a bright green envelope. 

Off the bat I was already confused, because the envelope wasn’t like any envelopes I normally get. I have three penpals who all stick to their usual theme. I have one that always sends letters in a cardboard looking brown envelope, one that uses the standard long white envelope, and another that uses the generic white rectangle envelope but always has pictures drawn all over it. The letter also didn’t have a return address. I just figured that one of my penpals had switched up their style and forgot to write their address or something. It seemed odd but I assumed it was nothing.

 I took all the mail upstairs and set it on the counter in my kitchen. I got distracted with revising an essay I had due the next day but had remembered the letter a couple hours after I got home. 

When I opened the green envelope there was nothing but a white lined folded piece of paper. I immediately got a bad feeling. Keep in mind penpalling isn’t just writing a letter, my penpals and I trade playlists, movie recommendations, drawings, postcards, etc. One of my penpals and I even share any recent dreams we’ve had with each other in our letters. So seeing just a random white piece of paper that looked torn out of a notebook was extremely odd. 

When I unfolded the piece of paper all that was written was “I don’t like her” in red marker. I was so confused. Didn’t like who? I had no idea why I was getting this letter and who it was referring too. It didn’t look like any of my penpals handwriting, not that they would send me something like this anyway. The writing was messy, and the marker was bleeding through as if whoever wrote it pushed as hard as they could on the paper. 

I immediately called and messaged all of my friends that I had went out to dinner with to see if they knew anything about the letter. My friend group isn’t the prank type but I was still hoping it had just been one of them trying to scare me. None of them knew what I was talking about. They all were super freaked out about the letter just as much as I was. Along with snail mail I also have all my penpals on social media, so then I had tried to contact all of them. Again none of them had no idea. There all sweet amazing people so there’s no doubt in my mind that there lying to me. Like I said I’ve been communicating with them all for about 4 years. There’s no way they would do something like this. 

I kinda forgot about about the whole thing after a couple days. Until yesterday when I opened my mailbox to see the same bright green letter. My heart sank. Again I took the letter upstairs, instead this time I wasted no time opening it. There was the same type of lined white paper but this time written in red ink was “she did it. I know she did. I never liked her” this message freaked me out even more. I had absolutely no idea what girl the writer of these letters were referring to. Again there was no return address, so there is no way of me finding out who is sending these. I don’t know, I’m just really confused with this whole thing and to be quite honestly scared.

I’ll let you know, if anything else comes in the mail.

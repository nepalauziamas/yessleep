Due to ever-increasing tuition fees, Alice, who was mostly called Ally by her loved ones, has to take a second job while still in her final semester. In addition to serving sugary pastries and fragrant drinks at her aunt's café, Ally had now sent in an application to work as a domestic helper for one of the wealthiest families in town.

Against her friends, who vehemently advised her against sending an application to this very family. Supposedly, the residents of the swanky house on the outskirts of town would be a little strange.

"Well, anyone who puts such ugly statues in their garden can't be all that normal,'' Ally chuckled to herself as she trudged up the long path to the mansion's wooden front door. 

Shortly after she sounded the echoing doorbell, the door opened and a mildly smiling lady stepped into the dim sunlight.

"Good evening. My name is Alice Cooper. I have applied for the vacant position of domestic help."

Barely visible nodding, the lady took a step back to allow Ally entrance.

Ally's gaze fell on one of the two marble staircases that connected at the top to form an even more impressive staircase.

With an arrogant look, a woman whose sight sent a cold shiver down Ally's spine strode down it. Immediately, a sweetly tart scent filled the wide hallway. The landlady was enveloped in a cloud of perfume so expensive that Ally would have to sell her car and one of her kidneys to afford a bottle of it.

"Mrs Cooper, please accompany me to my office," said the Mrs Meyer whose husband owned this property.

"Ms. Cooper," Ally improved, biting her tongue at the same moment. Avoiding the cold stare of her future employer, Ally regretted pronouncing this correction.

"So you're not married?" Mrs Meyer raised an eyebrow.

"No, I'm concentrating on my studies at the moment," Ally explained, trying to sound as confident as possible.

&#x200B;

Once in the first floor office, Ally sat down on one of the cushioned chairs.

"Your job will be to clean and look after the house while I am away. This will be mainly at night. Normally that is Yolanda's job, but she..." For a moment Mrs Meyer stopped her monologue -. 

"... probably won't be doing it much longer." and gave her stooping housekeeper a deprecating look.

Although Ally was burning to know what a woman like Mrs Meyer did out of the house at night, she refrained from asking.

&#x200B;

"Yolanda will show you everything you need to know. If any questions arise, please address them to her and don't bother me. I must... get ready now," with her chin high, Mrs Meyer strode past the two.

"Um, I can't tonight yet. I have an important lecture," Ally stammered.

Shaking her head, Mrs Meyer looked at the young student, "Then start tomorrow. Please arrive just before sunset. Not a minute later."

Hastily, Ally nodded and politely said goodbye to Mrs Meyer and Yolanda, who looked at her sympathetically.

&#x200B;

After wiping the counter at the café, Ally hastily devoured the remaining piece of chocolate cake, filled her glass bottle with the popular homemade pear lemonade, and then swung into her beloved pick-up. To the soft playing of the radio, she steered it to the edge of town and up to the estate.

The sun had not quite disappeared from the horizon. Grinning with satisfaction at her punctuality, Ally rang her new employer's doorbell again. 

&#x200B;

"This room here, dear, you are not to enter under any circumstances,'' Yolanda explained, tapping the locked door with her walking stick. 

"For what reason?" pecked Ally curiously. Yolanda had a distinctly warmer and more affectionate manner than her cool, aloof boss.

"You don't need to know the reasons. All you need to know is that you're not allowed in here... and you shouldn't be," Yolanda waved her off, indicating that they would continue the tour of the villa.

&#x200B;

"That's all you need to know for now. Please start in the kitchen and then work your way around. When you are done, you are welcome to lie down for a while. Mistress will be back around six in the morning." Yolanda gave the final instructions.

She was still quite nimble for an old woman who walked bent over on a stick.

Only for a moment had Ally looked up at the patterned ceiling and she was alone in the mansion, which was considered creepy by many residents of the small town near Washington and whose inhabitants were considered strange and quirky.

In the kitchen she began tidying, mopping and waving dust. The sounds of putting away the last plates from the dishwasher echoed through the wide rooms with high ceilings.

The silence after the echoing died away was almost unbearable. But neither a radio nor a television could be found in this house. Not even a record player stood in the living room where Ally set about gently dusting Mrs Meyer and her husband's art objects.

Statues and paintings, each uglier than the one before it, stared hauntingly at Ally with their painted eyes. Discomfort came over her at the sight of the Meyer family portrait.

Between Mrs Meyer and her husband, whom she had never heard of nor seen, sat a small, wryly smiling girl. Her blonde hair tied in neat plaits left and right with a little bow between them. She would almost be cute if she didn't stare.

Ally felt like she was being followed by her daughter's eyes no matter where she was in the room. 

After working the last statue with rag and duster, Ally filled a bucket with warm water and set about scrubbing the small floor tiles in the main bathroom. Sweating, she tied her black curls into a braid so they wouldn't hang in the soapy water. The monotonous movement caused Ally to switch off her head for a moment and listen only to the scratching of the brush on the tiles.

&#x200B;

The state of trance did not last long. Jerkily, Ally was jerked from her thoughtlessness. Were those footsteps? No, that was impossible. A glance at the clock told her that she still had over seven hours until Mrs Meyer came home from her night's activities. According to Yolanda, Mr Meyer was still on a business trip in Thailand. Ally tried to shake off the uneasy feeling.

Again Ally listened in the hallway outside the turquoise tiled bathroom.

Silence had settled over the whole house like a veil. A moment ago it had been windy outside, but no breeze rattled the windows, no whistling of the storm could be heard.

Clearing her throat louder than necessary, Ally began to thoroughly mop up the mop water and dry the floor.

&#x200B;

Before Yolanda had disappeared, she had shown Ally a room where she could spend her night's rest.

The room looked more like a broom closet and had nothing whatsoever to do with the bedrooms Ally had eyed while cleaning the hallway. Instead of an ostentatious four-poster bed, there was only a cot, which looked remarkably similar to those in a prison cell, in the far corner of the room. There was no electricity in the room either, so Ally used an oil lamp to find her way past the discarded furniture and old wooden toys.

&#x200B;

Sighing, she dropped onto the couch, which barely gave under her. Ally was already feeling the backache of tomorrow morning.

With a swift movement, she turned off the oil supply to the lamp and immediately the small room was shrouded in impenetrable darkness.

Closing her eyes tightly, Ally tried to get a few more hours of sleep before she had to leave the house in a few hours before Mrs Meyer arrived.

&#x200B;

Rudely, Ally was jolted from her slumber by the slamming of a door. Immediately she sat bolt upright on the couch. 

She was sure she had locked all the doors tightly before she had gone to sleep. That was how Yolanda had explained it to her.

On her socks, Ally groped her way through the darkness and grasped the creaking door of the small bedchamber with both hands. Cautiously, she peered out into the hallway and listened. 

Moonlight shining through the few skylights lit the hallway enough for Ally to make out which door kept swinging open and slamming shut again, as if someone were moving it. 

The room she was not allowed to enter under any circumstances, of all things. Great, Ally thought, and cautiously crept down the corridor. Again and again she flinched as the door slammed into the lock, only to fly open again a few seconds later. 

Slowly she raised a hand to check if the autumn wind was responsible for that noise, but nothing was felt on her skin. Nothing except the intense goosebumps that had now spread to the rest of her body.

Trembling, she reached out and grasped the handle. Her fingers clutched the curved door handle. Slowly, Ally pushed the door shut again. Despite being almost dizzy with discomfort, her curiosity took over and, just before she pushed the door into the lock, she glanced around the almost dark room.

A few dolls were visible. A child's room, Ally realised. 

She exhaled in relief. A nursery full of toys was really nothing to be afraid of, she laughed and turned her back on the door. For a moment she regretted leaving the oil lamp on the floor in front of the stretcher, for thick clouds had crept in front of the moon in that time and smothered every ray of light. 

With one hand on the wall, Ally groped her way back to her sleeping place. 

Her regained inner peace was interrupted by another crash.

Ally whirled around and stared at the door, which was wide as a pine tree. 

"Bloody hell," she cursed, stomping into the chamber and quickly reaching for the oil lamp. 

The beam of the lamp now showed Ally the full extent of the toy collection. Dolls of all sizes and designs sat on the bed, the floor in front of it or hung from the ceiling with red ropes. Countless eyes made of wood, glass or milky plastic stared at her from every corner of the room. Nowhere did Ally see a sweet-looking teddy bear or a car carved out of wood. It was all dolls. She noted with niece that none of them were particularly nice to look at.

Ally remembered her dolls from the past. Her favourite doll had been given to her by her grandfather. She wore a blue dress, had red coloured cheeks and looked totally lovely. 

It was the bigger ones that scared Ally. Some of them, sitting on the pink covered cot, were almost as tall as she was, should they be put down. Normally dolls were supposed to represent children, but some of the motionless figures had deep wrinkles and grey hair.

With a raised eyebrow, she examined the one hanging less than two metres above her. Red strings were tied around her slender wrists and ankles. Blonde hair tied into neat plaits left and right with a small bow between them. She would almost be cute if she didn't stare.

&#x200B;

"Ms. Cooper!" 

For a small moment, Ally's heart stopped. She had only heard that voice a few times, but the rasp in Mrs Meyer's throat was unmistakable.

&#x200B;

A comb ran in flowing motions through the shiny hair before it was tied into two braids. 

Bony hands tied practised red twine around pale, pale-stiff wrists.

"Yolanda, would you like to bring the red bow? This one goes best with the black of her hair, don't you think?" The corners of the old woman's mouth curled into a slight smile.

"And then please bring her to join the rest of my collection."

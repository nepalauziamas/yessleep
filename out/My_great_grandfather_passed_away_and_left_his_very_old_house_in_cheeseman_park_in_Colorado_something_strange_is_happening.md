Oct 12th 2021      (The 3 am knock)
It was late at night the kids was in there room sleeping while me and my wife was up late watching Netflix my wife said she heard something so l lowered the tv volume then I heard knocking at the front door I looked at the time it was 255 allmost 3 AM my wife said who knocks I said idk nobody normal and I grabbed my handgun went down stares looked thru the peep hole it was a old man and his wife all dressed up they must of been in there 80s I yelled (who is it and what you want at this time of night) he replied (it’s Philip and tulip we’re waiting for you it’s allmost time for the funeral)I then  I yelled from being tired (you got the wrong house
It’s 3 am I just moved here ) they didn’t say a word but started walking away they both had the most strangest walk allmost like they had the same limp and that was that I went upstairs told my wife she got creeped out and I told her not to worry I know it wasn’t the scariest but very weird and creepy but bare with me 
Because after this encounter it gets worst and worst until eventually we move out anyways .. my wife thought it was a good idea to get a dog for the kids and protection she really got creeped out and the kids always wanted a dog  I agreed and now we have all this extra space and were right next to the park so next day later she got a puppy we named it max everything was good until 3 days later    ………



Oct 15th  2021      (Worst time for a walk)

After a long cold day I decided to get the fireplace started from the wood I was chopping earlier that day my wife made dinner after she got the kids ready for bed then we talked she went to bed and I told her I’m ganna read a book next to the fireplace I got a glass of wine then another and I dozed up and woke up the scratching on the door I did get scared from how loud it was I grabbed one of those fireplace tools and then it hit me it was max he needed to go to the bathroom after laughing with the  weapon I picked up I set it down and grabbed a leash before i went outside i looked at the  clock 
It read 252 AM grabbed my Nikes and a random hoodie after a few minutes got max and the house key and locked it as I walked Across the street to the park …

Like for part 2 it gets creepy

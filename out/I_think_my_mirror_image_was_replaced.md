I can't look at my mirror imagine in the same way since it happened.

After coming home from work, I took off my hat and put it on a hanger. I heard a sound coming from my kitchen. It was the sound of a biscuit being cracked. After I heard it, I felt strange for a period of time. Robbers wouldn't come into the apartment to eat chips. That was certain, but I knew I'd heard something, and that I lived alone.

I still found the whole thing very strange, so I thought maybe I'd made the sound up, or mistaken it for something else. I'd done it before when I was sleep deprived. Hallucinations and all that, but that was after not sleeping for a whole day. I didn't call out or say anything. I felt that would be too crazy. Instead I walked over slowly towards the kitchen, intent on figuring out what was there.

I saw myself.

Yeah. I saw myself standing there with my headphones and my chips, dancing around in the room. Hands jerked up and downwards as elbows moved like waves. It, \*heâ€”\*me! slowly moved around until my eyes met my eyes. Well, it wasn't really my eyes. That was the one part of me that wasn't really like me. The eyes I saw were pitch black, completely soulless.

As I saw myself, I froze and slowly took of the headphones.

Then I bolted out of the room, catching myself completely off guard.

My kitchen was connected both to the livingroom but also to an hallway, as I was standing in the hallway, the other me, the one I saw, ran towards the livingroom. The whole experience was shocking, but it didn't put me into a state of shock, rather, andranline ran through my system at the sight of an intruder, and I quickly turned the corner to spot the myself.

I saw the back of my of my head sinking into my mirror and disappear. I walked over to it, and stared into the mirror, touching it to confirm that I couldn't go through. I saw my mirror image on the other side, repeating everything I did.

*Have I lost my sanity? Nobody who has lost their sanity would think that. But nobody that has their sanity intact would think that. No, what am I thinking, even when I've hallucinated in the past it's been nothing like this. I definitely saw that. What exactly was it Is saw though?*

"I know you're in there," I said to my mirror image, sceptically. It eyed me with the very same look I gave it, which pissed me off. I hadn't done anything wrong. And then I realized something, my mirror image was still wearing my headphones, despite me not having any. Slowly, I raised my hands and slowly moved them to my ears.

I touched my ears, but the mirror image's hands stopped on the headphones. My face turned white and eyes wide. It snatched the headphones and threw it towards me, sending it rocketing into my face. Ouch. It fell down onto the ground., and strangely, I could see it in the mirror now.

Something had changed though. My mirror image was no longer trying to mimic me. My eyes would jump from myself upwards at something else, and then back at me. My mirror image's face only grew whiter and whiter. At sudden moments my mirror image jumped slightly.

I think... I think somebody was screaming at me.

A large coal-black figure walked into the scene. It glanced through the mirror and sneered. By muscle memory, I looked at the spot in the real world it was inhabiting but there was nothing there. The figure had a large camera hanging of its neck, and I wondered what it was used for. It's large, thick hands, grabbed my collar and dragged me of the scene.

I saw myself fight and plead, but the large figure wasn't having any of it. Then I couldn't see anything in my mirror. I was just staring at the background of my room, I having no space in it.

All of a sudden, I saw myself walk back into the shot. Stand where I stood. Take a deep breath, and copy the expression of horror on my face. 

And then my mirror image acted like nothing had ever happened.

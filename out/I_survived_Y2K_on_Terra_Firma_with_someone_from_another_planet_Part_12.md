Cory asked the man how long and he said about 20 minutes, they were from a station far away. Cory looked at his watch and swore. "Guys, it's 9:58. We'll go to the next floor and head back up to where we were, I'll just tell you about the rest." 

He hustled to the stairwell and they followed in suit. With the echoing footsteps again and dancing flashlight beams, he explained they were going to where most of the researchers had been bunking; they had a makeshift kitchen and separate, albeit small bedrooms, but a lot of them had been living there for a month or two. 

Troy whispered, "I wonder if there's been any... romances", and wiggled his eyebrows. Lynn practically keeled over laughing and elbowed him and said, "I like you, you funny haired boy." 
Oli rolled his eyes, told her not to encourage him, and yet again lightly smacked his shoulder. Peter was starting to think that that was a regular occurrence. 

They walked past many closed doors to a small room with a fridge and sink. 

"Every floor has at least one telephone. Hopefully we'll be able to use them, though depending, they may not be much use for the outside world. Mark will figure something out though. I'm gonna walk between you guys, let's head back up." He said, leading back the way they came. 

"There's an emergency exit on the first floor and the top floor to the roof, and of course, the normal entrance which most of you came through, I presume. I'm not sure what to expect exactly, but there was a security fence that we generally leave open, that we will close once it gets close to midnight. 

You all have seen the majority of the third floor, it's where home base has been while researching the Y2K. 

The fourth floor is... hard to explain without seeing. (He had stopped on the flight of stairs and turned to look at them) It's a smorgasbord of equipment, some rooms ultra safeguarded for experiments I'm not at liberty to discuss... however that might go out the window if..."
He trailed off, spacing out.
He snapped himself out of it, 

"And where we keep the few rabbits left from sending to Earth", his face darkening. "I fought with Mark about that. We have a strict no experimenting on animals policy, and this seemed like a breach." 

Tabitha limped up closer and said loudly, "All the animals I collected were in good health aside from one rabbit that appeared to have broken it's leg at one point in it's life, it's being given safe medication to ease possible pain. They are in good care at my lab on Earth. The only tests we have run are DNA tests and health ones, they won't be experimented on. The chicken is fine, too. We named her Gertrude. She prefers hanging around the front desk and harassing people." She grinned at Cory. 

He seemed to relax a bit. "Okay, let's head back upstairs. The fifth floor is off limits aside from certain personnel."
People started murmuring amongst themselves and Cory wheeled around and held up his hands and said, "All I know and can say is that Mark has a room up there along with an office, he practically lives here, and a limited number of people have keys. That's all I know. Drop it unless everything goes to shit and it's necessary to know. The upstairs roof exit goes to the roof, obviously, where we have an outdoor garden and a pigeon home. Most of us are animal lovers, hence Nara being the star of the show today."
He looked pointedly at Peter while most of the researchers finally cracked some stressed smiles, and he turned red at the sudden attention. 

Cory looked at his watch and said, "Everyone that had red on their maps, we have time to use the phone again if you need to call your family. There are also three beepers in the nurses station if anyone in your family is traveling and only has those. We have approximately 8 minutes until the news station is here, please meet back in the teleportation room shortly. The rest of you, grab more snacks and head there or just go there if you're alright." 

He was trailing Tabitha, Troy, and Oli when he saw Lynn stalk up to Cory who was checking his own beeper.
He shook his head slightly, he could only imagine what she was going to talk to him about. He had a feeling it was the fifth floor.
He got caught up to his new trio of friends as they were nervously laughing.
"What'd I miss?", he asked.
"What are the chances we're going to stop one of these disasters? Wait!!!! What if they're connected?!" Tabitha yelled and slammed the door open to the teleportation room, where Jane rushed over after she saw Tabitha's face. 
God, she was smart. 

"Have you looked into if the electricity problems and the orb are connected?! I know the orb has been largely not able to be researched, maybe something was missed!" 

Jane had a conflicted look on her face. 
"We did initially when we would get small periods of it showing up on our map, but no links came up. We didn't think to check it again now that it's on our radar full force." 

She walked quickly to one of the computers by the map where it showed a large... orb or planet like thing moving incredibly slowly.Â  
She rapidly started typing things Peter couldn't comprehend and hit a couple of buttons on a machine near the map, and a printer below one of the computers started spitting out paper full of numbers and letters. 
Jane snatched it up and looked intently.
She sighed and said, "It's mostly inconclusive, we might not have advanced enough technology. There is an uptick of odd electrical wavelengths around it, but not enough to solidly link them, I think." 

She handed the paper to Tabitha to look over. While she was looking at the things Peter imagined he would never understand, he went to pour Nara some dry food he brought and ran to the kitchen to get her fresh water. She had been harassing a few scientists and researchers, though they seemed to love it. 
As he was pouring her food she nuzzled up on him.
"It's okay, lady", he said, sitting to give her some attention. What seemed like two seconds later he saw Tabitha waving him over. "Sorry Nara, I'll be back." He stood up and went over. 

"Did you find something?" He asked. 

"There might be a link. If I can get back to my lab fast enough to grab a piece of equipment that'll fit in the transporter I might be able to get more information!" 

"But what if your injuries get worse?!" Peter exclaimed, thinking back to his dream that seemed so real. 

"It would be worth it if I could help millions of people, somehow. It's worth trying", she said stoicly and he could tell by the determination on her face that there was no persuading her otherwise.
Shit, he thought he might be falling in love with her. 

"I should go with you", he said, and she immediately shook her head. The equipment would fit in the transporter just barely, even just with her it was going to be a tight fit. 

Just then, Mark burst into the room and said that the news people were downstairs in the lobby. 

Tabitha smiled at him and told him to go help Mark, and that she'd back ASAP, we'll before midnight, she'd make sure of it, and turned to Jane who'd been listening the whole time and already turned the machine on. 

He reluctantly went to Mark, damn this was a bad idea. 

Mark saw Jane and Tabitha busy, and said, "Alright, Peter, Lynn, Oli, and Penny, are you willing to come with me to talk to the reporters? We'll talk about the plan of what we're gonna say on the way down the stairs?" 
They all nodded, except Troy seemed annoyed, "What about me?! I was the one talking to Peter!!" 

"No offense, son, but your boyfriend seems much more eloquent and... less big mouthed than you", cringing slightly while smiling. 

Oli snickered and hugged Troy. "He's right, babe. We have to do this the best we can, and having someone talking that's from Earth is probably a good idea." 

Troy looked less pissed but still tense, and said, "Fine, but I'm coming down, too." 

Mark nodded in agreement and swiftly grabbed some documents off a desk, and started leading them to the hallway.
Penny looked like a scientist, Peter had seen her earlier, she was one of the women that had a red map and was crying. She seemed to be doing better but everyone was still on edge. Hopefully she convinced her family to evacuate without issue.
On the way to the door, he snuck a look back at the transporter where he heard Jame wishing Tabitha luck as the door started to open to the black box. Before she turned to step in, she looked up and locked eyes with Peter, and gave a small wave. 
He hoped this wasn't the last time he saw her. 

In the hallway Mark said, "Okay, let me do the talking about the hostage story, and about why the police aren't here yet. Once the camera is set up, you all are comfortable being on camera to break this down? Should we mention anything about Earth or will that convolute the warning? On second thought, it might just be better to warn people about Y2K, but I'm glad you guys are coming. I feel like it's important in case the news team actually asks us more questions, but I don't know if they'll cut shortly after. 

I'll probably say that you are all coworkers that worked closely with the disgruntled employee, and maybe that he is asking for his family, but won't name any names, which is why we called the news station, to try to get a family member to identify him and talk him down. I'll make up a name. Let's try to do this as quickly as possible so we can get back to the lab and see if Tabitha is back. Peter, I saw you talking to her, what did she go back for?" 

"Lab equipment that might be able to read the orb better." 

Mark nodded, in thought. 

They were getting to the last staircase before the lobby. 
Mark paused and turned to all of them. 
"Are we all okay with this game plan? Lynn, I might have you lead with the research your parents have done, if that's alright?" 

She said of course, and Mark slowly took a deep breath and opened the door.

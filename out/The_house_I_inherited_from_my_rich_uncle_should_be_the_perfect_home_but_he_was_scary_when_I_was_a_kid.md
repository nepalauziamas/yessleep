I would visit my uncle’s house often; he was, when he was a more agile man, very handy and constantly bursting with energy. If the house was ever a curse to him, no one could’ve detected it in those days. 

Woodworking was one of his primary hobbies that he enjoyed whenever it was warm out; Uncle Jack could be found lifting boards over his shoulder, angling his feet towards a side passage around the house to his workshop around back. The rear garden, being like an enclosure, was always beautiful with its brickwork, raised gardens, handcrafted pathways around orange tree saplings. Uncle Jack would invite my father—his brother—and my immediate family would find him cooking over a wood grill around back on summer days. There were statues too, wooden obelisks with twisted beautiful faces that Uncle Jack carved with his tools. He made the table we’d sit around on the back veranda.

Perhaps I’d been there before, but as with childhood memories, there is no genesis point. There are only fumbles of memory from one year to the next. But I remember *that* day I spent at Uncle Jack’s.

My mother squeezed my father’s hand. I could see her doing so between their front seats in the old Caddy. She whispered something to him I’m sure she thought I didn’t hear. “Don’t drink so much.”

“Pashaw,” said Dad.

“I’m serious. Whenever you get with *him*, you too always make it a competition.”

“That’s what brothers do.”

“Boys will be boys? Is that a justifiable excuse for a grown man?” Her eyes darted over her shoulder to me sitting in the back seat. I tried staring out the window, my mind took away on power lines and imagining a friendly stranger running alongside the car.

“Okay. Okay.”

“Good,” whispered Mom, giving his hand another squeeze.

There’d been whispers about Uncle Jack; that much I remember too. He’d received the house, he’d received all of my grandfather’s affections too, it seemed. My dad, for all his virtues, would sometimes betray his jealousies in flashes of expression when talking about his brother. I believe he loved him; he envied him too though.

When I stepped from the back of the old Caddy, my sneakers met hard gravel, then the steps of the old house. Dad left the car quickly after turning it off and rounded the hood to hold the door open for Mom. She stepped out and was funny beneath her large, floppy sunhat. We approached the house like you do any big thing that could swallow you, with caution and temptation in equal measure.

Uncle Jack answered the double doors and when we spilled in during the greetings, my eyes shot to the ceiling. Certainly, it could not be a home. It was too large for that. This was a place to display exorbitant wealth. Back in those days, the place was fuller with paintings on the walls and floor space strategically displayed between tables and chairs.

The back garden was strangely serene in the evening glow of the sun through the trees beyond the property. My parents sat together at the patio table while I joined Uncle Jack at the grill. He rotated sausages and scarcely paid me any mind. With a quick glance over my shoulder, I could see Dad pouring himself a glass from a decanter; he sniffed it then sipped from it before relaxing into the fabric of the chair. Mom fidgeted with the silverware on the edges of her plate, straightening them.

“How old are you now? You’re getting big,” growled Uncle Jack.

I hopped from one foot to the other, twisting around to see that my uncle had lowered himself to my position in a squat. “I’m seven-and-a-half.”

Beneath Uncle jacks prematurely graying beard, his pearly whites shown through like a display from an animal. But his eyes, watery blue, were gentle and the crow’s feet and his warm tan eased me. “Are you excited for genuine Polish sausages?” he asked.

I nodded the exaggerated nod of any kid.

“Good, good.”

“Hey, Jack!” yelled Dad from the table, “How’s that business with that Honduran *maquila* stand-still you were telling me about?”

A glance of anger shifted across Uncle Jack’s eyes before he patted me on the shoulder, rose to standing, pointed the spatula he’d been holding at Dad, and said, “No worries there. They’ll be back to work come Christmas, I’m sure.”

As the adult-chatter continued, I moseyed out from the patio, into the orange trees, beyond the eyes of anyone. Growing up affluent is a chore at that age. There are no other children and your parents care little about it. You speak with adults, you sit with them, you spend time among them. At least I did. I will not bemoan my privilege in this regard more than that. It was lonely—that is all I mean to say.

I found myself among the wooden carvings Uncle Jack made. Along the twisted natural move of each sculpture, there were also faces Jack made. Each expression seemed to move with the grain of the wood. Instead of forcing them out, each one seemed exposed more than constructed. They always made me uneasy.

Taking the path from the patio, further into the garden that stretched out perhaps another half-acre, I saw the small building near a back corner of the property’s fence. Along the way, I snatched an underdeveloped orange from one of the nearby adolescent trees and tried peeling off its skin. Growing frustrated at the fruit’s casing, I tossed it at the building, at Uncle Jack’s workshop; the orange thwacked the wooden door and thumped to the brick pathway leading to it. Taking a few feet closer, I saw I’d knocked the door ajar with my aim.

With a few hesitant glances towards the patio, I surmised the adults could not see, because I did not see them. Quickly, I moved for the door, pushed it all the way in and took in the smell of wood dust and oil.

Lining the interior walls of the workshop were chisels, screwdrivers, manual drills. In the far corner on a table were buckets of rags, bottles with indistinguishable liquids, and discard scrap; opposite these things was a table saw. Seeing the sun glint off the teeth of the table saw, I approached it and pressed my index finger to it before hissing and pulling my finger away. The skin was unbroken; I believe it was more the imaginings of what it could do to me if it came to life.

Shifting my attention to the buckets of rags, I lifted one, catching a whiff of chemicals undoubtedly clinging to the cloths.

As I sat the first bucket down, from the corner of my eye I spied a different bucket unlike the others; it sat furthest in the corner, by the wall and only had a single bunched and folded rag in it. Curious, I lifted the rag out with both of my hands and felt something like pebbles wrapped inside. I flapped it out like a small towel and whatever was inside clattered into the bucket.

I stood frozen, holding the rag between pinched fingers, hoping for my mind to make sense of it. Sitting in the bottom of the bucket were human teeth. I swallowed, feeling lightheaded; maybe it was the chemical fumes. Bending forward, I lifted one of the teeth and held it up to the light. Sunrays coming in through the single window on the wall near the table saw passed through the tooth nearest the place it should be connected to someone’s gums. I felt my own teeth with my tongue pressed against them. Letting out an exhale, the horror tingled up from within. Who’s teeth were these? Why would Uncle Jack have human teeth? I returned the tooth to the bucket and haphazardly tossed the rag over them, but before I could dart away, the rag itself caught my attention. There was a smattering of some old brown stain on it.

I ran from the workshop, up the path to the patio and as I took the steps leading onto the veranda, Uncle Jack angled into my path; maybe ten yards beyond, I could see my parents eating the prepared sausages; Dad took healthy swigs from his tumbler between fat bites and Mom carefully shucked the meat from its casing to set it aside.

Uncle Jack’s heavy hand gripped my shoulder, and I felt my knees grow weak. He met my height once more, this time taking a knee.

“Chrissy,” said Jack, “You’re plate’s ready.” He took a noticeable glance over my head before meeting my eyes. “Did you leave the shed door open?” He blinked a few times before shaking his head. “Well, that’s alright.”

“I was just looking at your tools.”

“Sure.” He grinned, exposing those immaculate teeth. “I’ll teach you how to use them sometime. If you’d like. Every young man ought to know how to work with his hands. Now, let’s get you something to eat.” keeping his grip on my shoulder, he ushered me onto the patio and towards the seat directly beside him.

Time passed and although I was certain of what I’d seen, I forced it from my mind. There could be no way he was collecting human teeth. Not my uncle Jack.

I sat in the kitchen at the white table by the window, furthest from the stove while Maryann yawned across from me over her cup of coffee.

“How’d you sleep?” she asked.

“Alright,” I lied. There may have been moments where I slipped into unconsciousness, but the big house kept me weary—like it was sapping my energy, but that’s nonsense.

“You would think I’d have a hard time,” she yawned again, this time producing tears and smacking her lips, “Sleeping in a place like this, I thought for sure the old house noises would keep me awake, but it stays so quiet here.”

I nodded, taking a sip from my own coffee, and cupping the mug with both of my hands. “Do you think we made a mistake coming here?”

Maryann chuckled. “There’s not a lot we can do about that now. We’re here now, aren’t we?”

Forcing a tired smile, I said, “You’re right.”

As we prepared for a day of unpacking and dusting and pawing through my uncle’s left belongings, I found myself entering the hallway past the foyer stairs, past the kitchen and dining hall, and out towards the glass doors that looked out onto the veranda. There, beyond the pollen-stained bricks and the mildly overgrown pathways of the garden, I saw the orange trees, plump with fruits; whenever I squinted through their limbs, I saw a glimpse of the old workshop.

“Hey, Mary!” I shouted. As no reply came, I shouted once more, “Maryann!”

“What?” Her voice echoed from somewhere near the den. 

“I’m going out back to the shed! Gonna’ see if there’s any tools out there. Maybe there’s some push brooms or something we could use for all the dust in this place!”

There was a long pause. “Okay!”

I pushed out onto the veranda and half-expected Uncle Jack to block my path. He would’ve been exactly the way I remembered him on that day. He’d grin a grin closer to a snarl, and I’d feel weak all over again.

Taking the path out to the workshop, I plucked a fat orange from a tree as I went and ripped it open with my thumbnails before tossing the skin pieces at my feet. Along the way, I passed by some of Jack’s twisted sculptures; some lay over on their sides while others were missing chips so that the faces looked on with deformity. When I reached the door of the shop, I bit into the first orange slice and tried the handle. It was stiff in its frame. Giving it a good shove, I felt it give only a little, so I moved around to the window to try and see if there was anything blocking the door.

Through the window, I saw a latch on the door with a padlock.

“Goddammit,” I hushed.

Taking another bite before discarding the remainder of the orange on the ground, I wiped my sticky hands on my pants then pressed on the handle, twisting. It was only when I used my shoulder and extended my knees that I gained any traction. Wood splintered, exploded, and I staggered into the room. It stank of dust, but little else had changed; there were things I did not remember, like the shelving nearer the ceiling or the chest of drawers.

In the corner, there were still old used rags in buckets. I moved to them and began dumping them out, but there was nothing. It was only rags and buckets, and I was being silly; it had been so long ago. Tracing the room with suspicion, my eyes rested on a push broom leaning against a wall; I hadn’t expected to actually find one but grabbed it all the same and walked out. Taking one last look over my shoulder, I chewed the inside of my mouth and stared at the chest of drawers. Without thinking, I moved to them and began opening each drawer. There were discarded wood wedges, nails, screws, hinges. 

Crouching down, I moved to the drawers nearest the ground and pulled them out. The ones on the bottom initially seemed empty, until I grabbed the last one on the right. As it spilled from its hole, it felt as though something shifted within, but looking at it, it was supposedly empty. I flipped the drawer upside down and saw that it had a false bottom, a simple sheet of thin wood. What spilled out from the false bottom were polaroid pictures. Setting the broom to the side, I sat completely with my legs crossed and pulled the photos into an even stack.

Shuffling the photos around, I counted five and laid them out around where I sat.

Sweat gathered on my brow, and I lifted the broom to use as a walking stick, steadying my steps while I returned to the house, the stack of photos packed underneath an armpit.

It was dizzying and by the time I reached the glass door leading into the house, I dropped the broom and pushed on.

“Maryann!” I shouted, my voice coming out strained, perhaps a little scared. “Where are you?”

I took the hallway leading towards the foyer and slapped a hand onto the banister, ripping myself onto the staircase. The photos spilled out from under my arm onto the stairs and I panicked to scoop them up.

Maryann met me at the top of the stairs, face flushed from the work of unpacking boxes in the master bedroom. “What? What’s the matter, Chris?”

I fumbled with the pictures; they once again fluttered from my hands like feathers, passing through the spaces in the banister and cascaded to the first floor. Without meaning to, I latched onto her shoulder with clawed hands. 

“You’re hurting me,” she said. Our eyes met and she quickly took on my weight and gently let me slide to the floor where I sat on the top step of the staircase; she came with me, squeezing me just as I squeezed her. I released my grip on her. “You look sick. Are you sure got enough sleep last night? You look fucking awful.” She put her fingers to my forehead. “You’re hot too. Do you feel woozy?”

\-

We sat around the photos, placed on the kitchen table in full display. 

“Where’d you find these?” asked Maryann.

“They were out in the workshop.”

“I don’t understand.” She lifted one of the pictures, taking it closer to her face before shivering and setting in back on the table. “Five women. Pictures of five dead women without eyes. Did your uncle do something with movies? Special effects?” She looked over the pictures again and shifted her gaze to look at the cabinetry across the room instead.

Movies? Had my uncle made movies? Immediately my mind went to the sorts of things you hear about on online forums where people brag about snuff films or underground basement tapes where actors don’t go home. That would be the only movies he’d be interested in, I’m sure. “No.” I popped her questions while they hung in the air; her shoulder slumped a centimeter while her foot began to tap against the floor. 

“Did you know?” she asked.

“Maryann!” I protested.

“Sorry! Alright?” Her chair scraped against the floor as she moved, leaned forward to stack the pictures and lay them facedown on the table. “I just—what the hell is that about? What kind of person was he?”

I shrugged, shaking my head. 

The eyeless sockets of the dead women staring up from those photos ran deep into their heads, black hollow through and through; it was as though there were no brains or muscle beneath the skin and bones. Infinite crevasses peering into the void beyond. They were unmistakably dead.

Maryann fidgeted with the hem of her shirt before placing her fists on the table while she pressed nails on the cuticles of her thumbs. “What do we do with them?” She nodded at the downturned photos.

“Burn them?”

There was a brief intake of air. “They must’ve had families. Shouldn’t we call the police?”

“Maybe. Yes. Probably.”

Maryann launched from her chair and moved to the cabinets across the room. She slung one of the overhead doors open, removed a bottle of dusty sherry, uncorked it, and took a drink before gathering two frosted tumblers and nesting with them at the table. Sitting across from her, I could see she was shaking as she poured my glass and slid it to me.

“Sorry,” she said, “It’s just the way there was nothing in the—” Maryann cupped a hand towards her eye like she meant to demonstrate what it would be like to pluck one out, “It makes my skin crawl.” She took a hefty swig from her glass and peered across the table at me. “Why’d you act like that before?”

“Like what?”

“You looked like you were going to pass out when you came up those stairs.”

I shook my head. “I don’t know. I mean, the pictures made me uneasy—just like you—but I don’t know why I felt so faint.”

She bit her upper lip, thinking. “Okay. We’ll call the police.” Another drink disappeared the contents of her glass. “But today, we drink.” She poured herself more. “God, you don’t think those poor women are buried somewhere around here, do you?”

Attempting a joke to lighten the intensity I felt coming off her, I said, “Or under the floor like The Tell-Tale Heart.”

Her eyes bulged. “Jesus, Chris! What’s the matter with you?” The trying smile fell from my face. “That’s not funny!”

\-

We left the pictures were they sat and took to the dining hall where Maryann had set her own pristine record player next to the worn phonograph. She shuffled through old boxes, boxes that had been there for undoubtedly years. It seemed some of them contained vinyl records.

I shuffled from foot to foot while standing in front of the dead fireplace, eyes glued to the spot where the Armalite used to hang on its spokes.

“Look,” said Maryann, holding up a naked vinyl in front of her chest with both hands.

“What is it?”

“Listen.” She moved to her player and arranged it before switching it on. The song ‘Stay’ by Maurice Williams and the Zodiacs hollered from the speaker.

“Nice.” I moved to the fireplace mantle where I’d sat my drink. I downed it before making a face.

As the day drew on and disappeared into night, the house swallowed sound and sight; it could’ve been the sherry bottles too. Maryann expressed her concern less about the photos as her eyes grew heavy and she eventually left me to myself with a goodnight kiss.

I told her, “I’ll be up in a bit,” knowing already it was a lie.

Watching her take the steps to the second floor from the dining hall’s threshold, I turned to look at the tall windows running alongside the fireplace. It was all black through them. Like yawning eye sockets.

I rubbed my arms to keep myself warm—really, I did it to more or less steel myself against the biting silence of the house. Morbid curiosity gathered in me the inclination to take another look at those photos; maybe I could study at them better without the scrutinizing eyes of another person and desensitize myself to their disturbing natures. Surely, they could be fakes. Good fakes. If I could just find something in them to prove it.

Wide steps took me from the hall to the kitchen and I moved to the table. It was empty. I scanned the kitchen counters. Maryann must’ve put them somewhere for safe keeping.

Standing dumbly in the kitchen, I felt goosepimples spring up across my arms and for a moment I couldn’t place why. Then it occurred to me that in the otherwise quiet house, I could faintly hear the sounds of scraping. Listening hard, I held my breath. It sounded like something was being dragged somewhere in the house, but I couldn’t be sure what. It could’ve been Maryann, I reckoned; maybe she’d decided to move some furniture.

Going to the stairs I took them two at a time on the tips of my toes and maneuvered to the master bedroom; after pushing the door in a crack to light its insides with my phone, I heard the faint snores of Maryann with her head tucked beneath the comforter on the blowup mattress. I gently shut the door and surmised I must’ve been hearing things that weren’t there. Certainly, it’s normal for someone to experience auditory manifestations in a place so quiet.

I paced around the balcony walkways overlooking the foyer, listening for the sound I’d heard before, but nothing came. 

When I came to my uncle’s locked study, I froze and listened again. Nothing came from within, but as I came to it, I felt the keyring Phil had given me shift in my pocket.

Before I had realized what I’d done, I was unlocking the door and stepping into Uncle Jack’s lair. The window over the desk was as empty and dark as all the others in the house.

The books on the wall, the swivel chair, the rug tucked halfway under the twin bed in the corner. What a place for the wealthy to entomb themselves. Tomb—that’s what it felt like. I sat on the bed and dust, maybe layered with dead skin, puffed off its surface into the dark room. Lying back and staring up at the ceiling, the place I’m sure Uncle Jack stared at whenever he would’ve had trouble sleeping, I wondered about the dead women in those photos.

Things felt familiar and foreign all at once.

I held my phone up to illuminate the smallish room.

At that moment, I heard the scraping noise again. This time, it came louder. It was scratching of some kind. Raising up from the bed, I focused.

Then I realized, the sound I heard was fingernails scratching across the floor.  Nails scratching the floor directly beneath the bed. I bit into my tongue so hard I thought I’d swallow it. A shaking breath escaped me, and I pounced from the bed like an animal, my phone’s light jostling madly in front of me in my outstretched hand. I rounded the corner of the threshold and ran partway down the balcony walkway towards the master bedroom.

Something—the pragmatist in me—forced me to stop and latch onto the railing to spin and look back at the study’s open doorway; shining my light there I saw nothing. There was no monster after me. It was merely an old house. 

It happened so subtly; I couldn’t guess when I realized it was there. Slowly a face appeared from around the threshold, sallow skin and a swath of black hair peering from around the trim at shin height. I saw nothing beneath the bridge of the face’s nose. It silently stared at me—or that may have been my imagination. Maybe it wasn’t staring at all, for I couldn’t see anything behind the mess of hair draped down its forehead.

I felt my lips physically quiver and the muscles in my body go weak. Stepping backwards slowly, never removing my light from the face, I pressed my back to the wall, felt for the doorhandle of the master bedroom and slowly stepped in.

The scratching noises did not persist, but I did not leave the room again in search of them.

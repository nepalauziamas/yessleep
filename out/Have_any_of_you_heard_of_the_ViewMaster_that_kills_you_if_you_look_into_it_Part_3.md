David was still holding the View-Master with wonder and glee as we stood outside the mountain cabin, speaking excitedly.

“This is gonna look so great in our curio cabinet...OF DEATH! A HAH-HAH. Next to my shrunken head, the baby doll that's eyes follow you--

“And my Precious Moments,” I added.

“Yeah, whatever.”

“Speaking of precious moments, if I can pry you out of the twilight zone for a little while, maybe --” I started, but I never finished, because when I opened up the front door, I was stunned to find lit candles, rose petals, and dinner prepared. He'd actually had the cabin catered before our arrival. Of course my heart melted.

We kissed. But then the romantic mood was broken when I realized how much he smelled of stale sweat after all that digging in the sun. I wrinkled my nose with an audible “eww.”

He agreed he was sweaty, muddy, and disgusting, and that he was going to take a shower.

“Okay. You enjoy your shower and your...precioussss,” I said channeling Golem. “Besides,” I added, “Cash Cow is coming on later.”

“And you say *I'm* lame,” he teased.

As David was taking his shower, a shadow appeared at the curtain.

A voice called out in a loud, demonic whisper, “It caaallls to yoouu!!

David screamed. Then he heard menacing laughter as the shower curtain was pulled back. I know all this because it was me! Using the words the deaf mute lady had said to him. I was pretty proud of scaring him into a scream, gotta admit. Good thing he was already in the shower so I couldn't see him piss himself!

Once I told him that, he retaliated by pulling me in the shower with him, drenching all my clothes. We laughed, we kissed, and we finally got to the romance I had endured all of the rest of this for. And that's where I wish the story had ended. But of course you know that it didn't end there.

The rest of the trip was very nice and uneventful. The following night we were back home, sitting together on our couch. David was toasting.

“To our 4 years of marriage. To all my collection of unusual treasure. And the one of greatest value is my beautiful wife, Jill.”

“That's so romantic,” I told him. “I beat out a Satanic Polaroid, a shrunken head and a glowing View-Master.”

“And it was only a moderately close race,” he reassured me.

I told him with lines like that, it's a good thing he was cute.

David picked the View-Master up off the couch and walked over to the curio cabinet. He opened the door and placed it on the top shelf. Then he said he was really beat and about to turn in, but I wasn't ready yet. It was time for *Cash Cow*. Do you ever watch *Cash Cow*? Yeah, it's pretty silly, but definitely a guilty pleasure for me.

I just love it when the announcer says “Welcome to another exciting edition of...” And then the audience screams out in unison CASH COW!!!” And the announcer follows up with “And the host of *Cash Cow*, Christopher Dokken!”

And Christopher always asks “And what do we want on *Cash Cow*??”

And I can't help but shout along with the TV audience, “MORE COWBELL!!!”

Christopher always starts with a joke, or as he says in his New York accent, a little *Cash Cow* humah. “What kind of wood doesn't float?”

A beat while we think about it, then he answers, “Natalie Wood!”

Yeeesh. Well, at least you can't say “too soon.”

The crowd laughed at it at least.

So I sat in the mostly dark living room, bathed in the TV's glow. *Cash Cow*'s contestant, Doris was sitting on a cow named Betsy. Christopher Dokken was explaining that Doris just had to get one more question right without falling off of the cow or getting a question wrong.

“And remembah, if at any time, Betsy here decides to take a big steaming dump, the game is ovah! And you get nothing! Nada! Not a fuckin' thing!”

Again, the TV crowd cheered.

Christopher continued. “Okay, so Doris has successfully tipped over three cows, answered nine questions right, sat on Betsy for 17 minutes without falling off, and how much has she won?”

“Doris has won twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five ceeeeeeents!!” the TV announcer excitedly informed us.

“But Doris,” said Christopher, “we have placed something of great value in the ass of this cow. Now you can take the twenty-eight dollars and seventy-five cents you've won, or you can risk it and BET THE COW! Then you can stick your ahm up Betsy's ass...”

Betsy let out a worried “Moooo!”

“...and pull it out! What will it be, Doris?”

Doris was clearly indecisive, looking to the noisy crowd for advice. After all, $28.75 was...not jack! Come on Doris, what's the conflict? The unseen crowd urged her to “Bet the cow! Bet the cow!”

“Oh Christopher, I think I'm gonna bet the cow!” Doris nervously decided.

“She's gonna bet the friggin' cow!” Christopher Dokken announced.

And at that point, I must have fallen asleep. Either that or Cash Cow is an even weirder show than I thought it was because that was when things that were utterly impossible began to take place. The camera was focused on Christopher but in the background, out of focus, I could swear it looked like...then the foreground started to blur and the background gradually came into focus. David appeared on the screen, entranced, holding the View-Master. He raised it to his face and began to look into it, But Doris, Christopher, and even Betsy didn't even seem to notice he was there. Then David blurred in the background again and the camera zoomed in on Christopher's face. A glowing red light began to bathe him, The chants of “Bet the cow!” were fading out until finally there was only an eerie silence.

Now all I could see was Christopher Dokken, and it seemed unmistakable that he was also looking back at me. Ominous music began playing behind him. Christopher Dokken spoke with a creepy quiet, taunting voice, “Jiiiilllll, looks like David's about to bet the cow.” And as Christopher turned to look back over his right shoulder, the camera followed him and David once again came into focus. He was shaking now, but not from fear. I'm pretty sure he was ecstatic. The View-Master dropped from his hands and he reached in his pocket and brought a knife up to his throat. The chants from the crowd of “Bet the cow! Bet the cow!” started to rise again. David seemed to look directly at me. He'd stopped shaking and a calm settled over him.

“It's beautiful,” he said through tearful eyes, and brought the blade up to his throat.

I jumped off the couch, screaming “David, no!” in horror at the television.

The next thing I realized is that I had fallen off the couch onto the floor. I looked at the screen expecting to see the horror of David slitting his throat to continue.

Instead, what I saw was Doris still sitting on Betsy. The show was back to what passed for normal on *Cash Cow*. Christopher was saying they were out of time and we would all have to tune in next week to see what's up Betsy's ass on...Cash Cow!

I got up, heart still pounding from horrible nightmare, but thankful that's all it was. I decided to go to the bedroom just to see David. To make sure everything was okay. As I walked across the carpet, I felt my foot kick something. I looked down. The View-Master was lying on the floor. That wasn't right. It should have been on the top shelf of the curio cabinet.

I stared down at it, trying to process. I picked it up and walked over to the curio cabinet. The door was open. I placed the View-Master back on the top shelf. Then I went into the bedroom. I started telling David that he'd left his haunted View-Master on--

But I never finished. Because that's when I saw David. On the floor. Blood covered his t-shirt and sweatpants. Red stains across the white sheets of our bed. And written in his blood on the wall behind the headboard was “BEAUTI--.”

That's as far as he had gotten I guess before losing consciousness.

After that, I don't know how long it was that I did anything other than scream.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

And now you know everything I know to this point. I am beyond devastated, as you might imagine. All the years David and I would have had together will now be years I spend alone with my grief. Grief and memories are all I have now. But I am determined I will have something else. I will have answers. And I'm going to the only possible source of those answers that I am aware of. It's time to pay Frank another visit.

I came home after working 12 hours, asked if he took my dog out, he did not. I was able to take her out in between jobs so it was 6 hours but I try to take her out every 4 hours or less. 


Asked him if he could put my rehearsal dress on he said no, told him to put the dress on because I wanted to see what it looked like not wrinkled and he still said no.


Asked him again and he finally did it. Told me to take it off right after I showed him with the new shoes I bought that just arrived. 


He told me to come over to him to help take the dress off. This is not a normal zip dress it has a corset. While coming over I was undoing the laces at the top, he told me to stop I said these need to get undone then he slapped my wrist and said stop. I walked away and undid it myself. Upset at the fact that he would hit me and treat me with such disrespect. 


I took a shower and decided not to make a big deal about it and tried to cuddle with him to go to sleep as I was really tired from the shift and didn’t want to make a big deal about it. Then he pushed me away saying ohh now your not mad? I said no, come here and cuddle and he said no you can’t just make a big deal then try to cuddle. 


So I said you shouldn’t get mad and hit me out of anger. I said it makes me feel sad when you do that and you don’t do that to people you love, he then started to explain how I disrespected him for not stopping undoing the lace. I said under no circumstance should he touch me like that. I said no one has ever touched me like that, he said maybe thats the problem I said no you are the problem. 


I said adults don’t hit each other like that under any circumstances. I then started to cry and say why are you being so cold, why don’t you care, your upsetting me I’m crying and you don’t care, he then said you are upsetting yourself rolled over and left. 


He came back like 5 minutes later. I decided to get up and go to the couch as I was crying and he was just laying there silent not saying anything, and now I’m left all alone crying on the coach. 


I don’t know what to do. We are supposed to get married in 2 weeks but I don’t feel like we are a team. I don’t think he care or Ioves me. I hate this. I want him to do better. I want to work this out but it’s so close to the wedding and he doesn’t seem to think that the way he treats me it wrong.

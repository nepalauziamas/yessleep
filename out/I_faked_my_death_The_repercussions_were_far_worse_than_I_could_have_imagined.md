I think it is safe to say that almost everyone has fantasized about faking their death at some point. Few have done it. Even fewer have accomplished it without getting caught. 

No one has had the experience I did once I set out to make everyone believe I had passed away.

I saw the surveillance camera at the front of the nearby gift shop. The store sat on a cliffside. I knew it would capture my Nissan going into the lake. I knew the water was so deep that divers were unlikely to find the corpse I had a grave-robbed. The cadaver was to stand in for me in the driver's seat. The authorities would see a silhouette of my type of physique when they looked at the recording. 

The depths were so great that I never heard of divers ever finding anything. The long history of drownings by drunk tourists made this a surprise.

I placed a lever on the accelerator. I swept up the tire tracks on the small patch of dirt in which I had staged the incident of the vehicle going off of the road. My chosen point was on top of a large drop-off. This would lead to the car sinking to the bottom-most part of the dark waters.

I planned the incident for months. I must admit I had conceived the idea years before. It took quite a lot of time for me to convince myself to carry through with it. 

It was easy to get in touch with the resources required to form a new identity. 

All it took was a tor browser and a razor-sharp gut instinct to recognize who could help me. Many were potential officers or agents, after all. Using the dark web, I was able to get a forged birth certificate and every card needed. 

I was going to start a new life in a desert town with a very humble job, some kind of unskilled labor position. Yet it would be worth it. 

Or so I thought.

I changed outfits and used new clothes from a backpack I brought with me. I applied fake facial hair. 

I walked to the nearest bus stop which was six miles away. Even though it felt like a victory lap, it was also one of the more excruciating saunters I have ever taken. It was cold, dark, and desolate. I had to remind myself that the fewer witnesses, the better.

I took the form of public transportation to a city four hours removed from the town where I had built my life. I stayed at a slum motel. 

I would go to a black market surgeon the next day and get facial reconstruction.

On the walk to the office, I thought of my motivation to disappear. 

The reason I faked my death is because of how much money I owed to a major loan shark within a crime syndicate. I was a degenerate poker player. By the time I thought about reaching out for help for my addiction, it was already too late. I owed well over two hundred thousand in expenses, and I was not lucky enough to be able to pay it back. 

A gangster named Johnny ‘Fuse’ Malone would be on the lookout for me, and I knew he would have no mercy.

The illegal doctor's office was in the basement of a public laundry mat. When he greeted me at the door he then escorted me down the stairs. The setting was nowhere near as sanitary as I had hoped for it to be. The walls had ancient mold. There was the sound of a leaking pipe in the background. The operating table looked less like a hospital bed, and more like a mattress, the kind one would find at a junkyard.

I wanted to turn around and run away. I also knew I could not afford to be selective under the circumstances.

“May I ask what your name is, sir?”

It was a stupid question on my part. Anonymity was something he not only preferred but required.

“You may call me Dr. Harmon,” he said with a wink.

The drugs he gave me were better than most anesthetics given in the commercial medical world. I did not feel any pain in the beginning and passed out for a long time.

\*

It took a month for the agony to vanish. I was able to stay in a sleazy room monthly after proving to the landlord I was a quiet tenant. 

I picked up a gig as a gas station attendant. I even became above-average at cleaning the hotdog grill. Despite the monotony and rude customers, it was nice to be someone few people cared to pay much attention to.

After my shift, I would lay in bed and wonder how my wife, Natalie, was doing without me. 

I encrypted the Wi-Fi and Googled my name.

The memorial service for me was another two weeks away. I am sure it took her such a long time to prepare and organize the event due to her grief. 

I felt guilt. 

\*

Curiosity got the better of me. 

I would have to go to my memorial. 

I reasoned nobody would recognize me with my recent extreme changes. Part of me knew that pursuing attendance at such an event was born from at least a little bit of narcissism. To hear people wax poetic about how much they missed me would at least make me feel a little less alone.

I practiced vocalization methods to try and manipulate my voice. I did not want Natalie to recognize or suspect it was me based on the way I sounded. 

Within a few hours, I had managed to have the sound of someone else. 

The memorial was to take place on a Sunday in a closed-down restaurant.

I showed up in my best clothes with a bouquet. I even rehearsed my sad look. I fashion a fake background in my relationship with the old me. I would say that we were fishing buddies.

I arrived sharp on the time the service was to start.

No one else showed up. 

The parking lot was devoid of cars.

I looked around and waited for individuals to start pouring in.

An hour later, no one was there still.

I was enraged and wounded. All the friends I had made at the gambling parlors, the coworkers in my job. It seemed as though none even noticed I was gone.

*Natalie would be here*, I thought. 

I checked my phone. I went to the memorial website. There was no mention of a rescheduling.

*Am I that insignificant to everyone I’ve ever known?*

I stepped into my Subaru and decided to drive to my old house.

\*

I stationed my vehicle near a foreclosed apartment building. I was a half block away from my one-time residency. I purchased a set of binoculars at a store a few miles down the road. 

I watched as my wife washed the dishes. Seeing her face again made me feel very emotional. I had forgotten how much I had missed her all along. The awareness of it overcame me and it was unwelcome and overwhelming.

I saw a Nissan which matched the exact one I had drowned. I saw a man get out. He dressed in the same business casual clothes I used to wear whenever I had errands to run around town. He even had on a wristwatch that belonged to me at one point.

*Is this the new boyfriend?* I thought with a certain amount of jealousy and ire as I squinted through the lenses.

What I saw made my legs feel like jelly. The man had my face. He had an identical build. I watched as he reached into his pockets, pulled out a house key, inserted it into the doorknob, turned, and entered. 

He shut the door behind him and embraced my wife. They kissed.

I felt my stomach turn.

I acted on emotion without an ounce of forethought. I drove up to the house, parked along the fence, and got out. I stared at the Nissan and realized how even the license plate matched the old one.

I walked up to the front door and knocked.

The poser-me answered.

“I’m a God-fearing Christian,” my twin said, “but I don’t subscribe to the Jehovah’s Witness religion. Thank you for your time today, though. Better luck at other households.”

I gazed down at my wardrobe and realized I did look like someone spreading the Word. I absorbed how much his voice did sound like mine, a professional imitator.

Before he could slam the door shut, I intercepted it with an open palm.

“I’m not with any church,“ I said. “I’m a journalist. Your story is amazing. How was it determined that you were not missing or dead?”

He stared at me with annoyance before he answered. 

“Some drunk driver punched their ticket by dropping from a cliff," he said. "Law enforcement thought it was me. In actuality, I was having a nervous breakdown. I was struggling with addiction issues, so I was off the grid for a while. I felt guilty for taking the unannounced leave of absence from life, but I’m making amends for it. I am also speaking with the lawyer to sue the idiot media for emotional damages. My wife believed I was dead. Please emphasize in your article how I will be pursuing litigation. Is that enough ink for you?”

He shut the door then. A terrible sense of panic started to overcome me. I heard my wife’s voice on the other side addressing him, asking him what happened with our encounter and who *I* was.

I had noticed the deepening of the lines on his face. I did not fault my wife for failing to see the differences. I am sure she was overwhelmed with joy at saying who she perceived to be her husband again. 

I knew that the man had a facelift.

\*

I went to the Laundromat. I rushed to the door and found it locked. I kicked it down. 

I rushed down the stairs and saw the doctor. He sat on a stove with a table full of scissor forceps and other surgical implements. He appeared to be reading some kind of scientific journal. He looked up at me.

“I'm closed,” he said.

I walked up to him and grabbed him by the lapels. He immediately started to resist, so I grabbed the back of his right leg and pushed his chest with my free forearm. He fell on his backside. His elbow hit the table. The tools went flying. I flipped the desk over. I bent over him and clutched the collar of his shirt.

“You worked on someone who came through here and requested the face I used to have," I said. "I know you did. I need to know his name and his motivation for why.”

“Even if what I do is not within the confines of the law, I must respect my patient's privacy. Also, I rarely know their names. You should’ve concluded on your own before you walked in here and threatened me.”

I watched his hand as it seemed to fumble on the ground for something. 

He had a spinning power drill pointed a millimeter away from my face before I could blink twice.

“Get off of me or I'll give you permanent brain damage.”

I let him go. The whirring noise was loud and the very air of the cylindrical sharp object was a hair away from my skin. I did not take his threat as a bluff. 

I jumped back a few feet and wondered if I could ram my shoulder into his neck before he would be able to stab me. I also knew the risk was not worth it because of where he held the newfound weapon.

“You know more than you’re letting on,” I said with my hands in the air.

“You’re right,” he said. “I usually don’t get involved in the affairs of the people who come to me. Since you agitated me today, I’ll tell you everything I know, but you won’t like it. The man who came into my office and asked to look like you did not arrive alone. He showed up with a group of men. They were all in expensive suits. One of them claimed his name was Johnny Malone. Since I do read the news, I was very familiar with his reputation. Johnny ‘Fuse’ Malone and his crew came to me. They told me to do a number on your face, to make sure you would never resemble your old you again. The story they told me is they wanted to kill you. They knew someone replacing you and every facet of your old existence would kill all dignity. Knowing someone else was occupying every aspect of the life you used to lead is a fate worse than death."

He looked me in the eyes before he continued: "Doesn't it make you wish you were more grateful for what you used to have?”

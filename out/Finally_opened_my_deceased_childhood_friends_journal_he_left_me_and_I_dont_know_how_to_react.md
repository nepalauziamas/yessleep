I had read the earliest entry when it was first bequeathed and I didn’t think much of it. He passed in 2010 from supposed Parkinson’s, but we never really knew what happened, just that it was very sudden. However, we wanted to do a 10 year celebration of his life when Covid hit and had to postpone it until this year. I thought I would transcribe the journal and have it available to have pieces of it read at the celebration, but I’ve been reading it and I’m somewhat in shock. Here’s the current transcript. 

February 3rd, 2000
Dad’s been gone for a week. I feel empty. It was so sudden, no one expects an aneurysm. Mom was silent for a while, but she’s here now. She cooked, for the first time in months. Given, it was honestly weird tasting. But she’s really stepping up, being the mom I always needed. I have to go, it’s time for his funeral, and I have to be strong. Mom refused an open casket, but it’s probably for the best. She has some weird superstitions, and maybe that’s one of them. My tenth birthday is next week, and I’m having a party, but it just feels wrong without Dad.

Wow, my diary from when I was a kid! But my last entry was when my dad died….. That’s morbid. Not much has changed, except mom still doesn’t cook. She cooked for around a month after he died, but she was bad at it, nothing ever tasted right. I threw up a couple times after dinner, and the meat always came out feeling wrong on my tongue. So she stopped. It’s my twentieth next week. Ten years since Dad died. Mom acted funny at first but she’s back to normal now. I never actually got to college, we didn’t have the money to afford it. But that’s ok. Mom didn’t ever really work much afterwards anyway, so I never got my hopes up. I’m just grateful that ten years later we’re okay.

I’ve been getting a lot of headaches recently. I’m probably just dehydrated but it’s still annoying. Mom has been getting snappy, and we’ve fought more than ever. I think it might be time I move out. I still live in the small town I grew up in, and it might be time for a change.

New Apartment!!!! I don’t know why I brought this old diary with me, but it's totally nostalgic. I was a pretty cool kid I guess. I’ve had a ton of arm pain recently but I don’t know, it's probably stress. Mom practically kicked me out when I said I might leave, and travelling to Austin was a weird experience. I’m used to the middle of nowhere and this most certainly isn’t. The headaches have gotten worse, but advil seems to help.

April 19th, 2010
I am having difficulty walking, which is really weird. I went to the doctor, but they just prescribed me with pain meds, and I didn’t even remember to mention the balance stuff. I’ve been tripping too, how tired am I???? I have a job interview tomorrow, so hopefully I’ll feel better by then.

April 20th, 2010
I got the job! Meet the new assistant coordinator of this cute little startup! So much work to do, and the pay is crap but I’m still excited. My hands have been shaking all day! 

April 27th, 2010
Or all week.

May 13th, 2010
It’s Dad’s birthday. Mom called today. She couldn’t stop crying. Then she couldn’t stop laughing. She called four times, each time forgetting she called before. I’m scared. Before I left she was having trouble walking. 

May 25th, 2010
I’m going to visit mom. She’s bedridden at home, and I need to see her. I’m taking a week off of work, so there goes that promotion. I can’t lose her too.

May 26th, 2010
Mom barely remembers me. She can’t eat and I can tell it's almost over. She handed me a letter, but I’m too scared to read it. I just want to be here for her. She is all have left.

May 27th, 2010
She’s gone.

May 28th, 2010
I still haven’t read the letter. I’ve scaled back on work, partially because of grief, and partially because I can’t stop shaking. I’m forgetting simple tasks, yelling at co-workers… what is wrong with me?

June 28th, 2010
I forgot where I put this journal. Everything is getting harder. My legs are practically immobile now. I can't stop crying. I’ve been to doctor after doctor and no one knows what’s wrong. Why am I so sad? There’s a letter on my desk, but I feel dread whenever I look at it. I quit my job.

July 1st, 2010
I read the letter. Mom was more spiritual than I thought. She only cooked for a month after dad died, because the meat wasn't fresh afterwards. I feel sick. She and dad had done this. It was never an aneurysm. I’m starting to forget what day it is, who I am. She killed me. I am dying and I can’t even remember why. 

July 2nd, 2010
I quit my job.

July 9th, 2010
I read the letter. Or, I tried to. My hands kept shaking, and I couldn’t focus on the words. I can’t move anymore. What is wrong with me? Everything is getting harder. My legs no longer work, and my throat is closing up.

July 17th, 2010
I can’t do this. There is nothing left.

August 1st, 2010
Wow, my diary from when I was a kid!

The rest of the journal is illegible scribbles. Any advice on how to proceed with the celebration of his life next week?

Hello, I've been debating about posting this for a while but my friend said I should. I wanna state that this incident is 100% true but may be explainable. This happened two years ago during late August of 2020. Me and a good friend of mine (we will call him Sam) were going to do a two-day one-night camping trip deep in the Sierra Nevada mountains of northern California 40 miles north of Yosemite. We were scouting deer ahead of the season. We parked on the side of a two-way highway which was around 7,000ft in elevation and started walking straight up the mountain. 

We had come upon a clear flat meadow and decided it was a good place to camp. Once we set up camp we climbed up to about 9,000ft and came upon another meadow, we will call this the “upper meadow”. This had the most beautiful views I have ever seen of the Sierra Nevadas. At this point, I was tired and Sam wanted to explore the rest of the upper meadow. I wanna say it was about 350-400 yards long. The grass was about waist high. We had brought a small little camping chair that fits in one of our packs. Sam wanted to explore and I wanted to sit and see the view and eat a snack, so we decided to split up. It was about 15 mins later when I got this weird feeling. It wasn't necessarily a sacred feeling but put me on edge, so I decided to get up to try to find Sam and reconnect. It took me 6 whole minutes to find him which didn't make any sense. It was a fairly long meadow, but 6 minutes just felt too long. Something was just off about this meadow. While writing this Sam and I both just got goosebumps looking back at that moment. For some reason, we can't remember how, but eventually we met back up and went to the top of the mountain. At this point, we decided to go to the top of the mountain and looked around, and then decided to go back down. Once we had gotten back to camp we decided to eat dinner and go to sleep around 9:30 pm. 

This is where it gets interesting, once we had gone to bed nothing seemed out of the ordinary, animal sounds here and there, but after around 45 minutes we had both fallen asleep. It wasn't until (I’m thinking 12:30 am) I woke up to the sound of what I thought was a branch getting smacked against the tree. This went on for a while and it was coming from all around. As I was laying in my sleeping bag listening to this it suddenly stoped. Now one thing I forgot is where we set up camp. It was next to the edge of a straight climb up a mountain. The reason I say this is that I heard/felt a sound kind of like running but the thud of its footsteps sounded heavy like really heavy. The only thing I could think of during that time was “WTF” is going on out there and I just couldn't move. I could hear this thing running until it suddenly stoped, and then I heard it again, when I heard it run it almost sounded like it was on two legs. This happened 4-5 times then it all stopped for good. 

The next morning I woke up to see if I could find anything about what happened during the night but found nothing, it was the strangest thing. Sam didn't hear anything so he didn’t believe me at the time but now looking back he feels differently. I don't know what to make of this whole situation. Writing this made my blood run cold. Ever since then I’ve had so many questions and no answers. I'd love feedback from all of you.

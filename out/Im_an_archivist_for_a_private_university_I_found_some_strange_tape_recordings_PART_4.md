Naissance here. It’s a weird name, I know. 

The last recording and subsequent experience in the maintenance tunnels gave me a lot to think about on the drive to California. There was something under the university; that much was apparent. But what was that ‘something’ exactly, anyway? The commonalities between the tapes  became clearer and clearer as I went on. I decided to bring them with me. I know to do so would be inviting trouble— but I decided to regardless. I would be in California for a couple of days, and I figured I could get some work done while I was. My theory is that the underground places in the tapes are, in fact, one in the same; despite being hundreds, even thousands of miles away from each other. It’s the only way to explain the connectivity of it all, even if it makes no logical sense. Stevens, Al, and the old man were transported to this place when they crossed a certain threshold. Stevens, when he scaled that cliff. Al and the old man when they went through the old tunnels. 

The thing is, Natalie didn’t enter this ‘door’ to the same place that the others did. But she heard those that had. Her voice both entered, and exited this place, at two completely different locations in time and space. The same happened with Stevens. *The* *Place,* as I’ve been calling it for lack of a better name— it was bigger than just some monster, or supernatural occurrence. It couldn’t be explained off, or even understood. It was apparent to me now that *The Place* was related to nearly every single one of the tapes I had in my possession. I wondered if there were more, or if it was ever documented in a medium other than these tapes. Clearly someone thought them important enough to label and number, so the possibility of others was there. But I had a suspicion that wasn’t the case, that these were the only ones in existence. The recordings were warped by something malevolent; touched by whatever unholy, eldritch power controls that place. If not physically, then in its relation to *The Place*. I’m reminded of my dream, drifting through a dark abyss, waiting for what’s at the bottom to pull me even deeper still…

I’m getting ahead of myself, though. A lot of this is speculation about something I don’t really understand just yet. This interview, however, may answer some of the questions that I have about the nature of this place and the incident in tape 1A. I’m still debating whether or not I should play the tape for Clara. I have an irking feeling that I probably shouldn’t, and that it would do more harm than good. Though, depending on what she knows, it could give her some much needed closure. I guess we’ll find out tomorrow morning. I’ll provide the transcript of the interview here in this post, along with some of my notes during and after. I hope that my conversation with Mrs. Stevens yields some answers about what this place is, and if not, some fruitful information about her team’s expedition.

**INTERVIEW WITH CLARA STEVENS**

DATED: SEPTEMBER 13TH, 2022

___

*Mrs. Stevens lives in northern California, wine country. A small town named Ukiah. The town is surrounded by rolling green hills, forested mountains, and farmland. In a way, it reminded me of Hillview. I had never been to California before, lived in Oregon my whole life. Ukiah didn’t fit the image of coastal cities and surfer culture that I had expected.* 

*The small rustic cottage she called her home sat before me as I pulled into a long, dirt driveway. It could have been a hundred years old. There, I could see Mrs. Stevens sitting on a rocking bench out front. She waved, and ushered me inside. We exchanged greetings, and sat at a small dining table. She presented me with a cup of black coffee, of which I happily partook. The decor was tacky and quaint, but the cottage was surprisingly well kept considering how old it looked. Despite Mrs. Stevens' old age, well into her 60s, she seemed to be in shape and capable. I spotted various exercise equipment and miscellaneous hiking gear around the room, as well as a heap of marked maps that littered the walls. It seemed that she stuck with her adventurous side all this time. I noticed a framed picture of three people with caving gear on the wall as well. Clara and what must have been Tom and Jeffrey.*

**\[START\]**

MRS. STEVENS: I’m happy you came all this way to talk to me, Miss Moris. I know the drive isn’t so easy. 

*Mrs. Stevens took a sip of her coffee, and moved her short, wavy gray hair to the side.*

NAISSANCE: The pleasure is mine, Mrs. Stevens. I’m glad you answered and were willing to talk. I can’t say I was expecting as much, if I’m being honest. It was a crapshoot.

*Mrs. Stevens smiled, then nodded. Her warm, inviting expression slowly faded, as if recalling a bad memory.*

MRS. STEVENS: I still think of him— almost every day. It’s been almost thirty-five years since. So when you called out of nowhere, I was surprised. I thought I would die along with the memory of that day. As far as I got away from that place, and as deep as I tried to push what happened in that cave to the back of my mind, it still haunts me.

\[PAUSE\]

MRS. STEVENS: I didn’t think I would ever hear anything about that recording after all this time. I thought it was gone, never to be listened to again. Is it in there?

*Her eyes glanced at a small satchel I had brought along with me. Inside were the cassette tapes, and a cassette player. I still hadn’t decided at this point whether or not I would have her listen to her late husband’s last moments. I nodded.*

NAISSANCE: Why would you think no one would listen to it again?

MRS. STEVENS: The agency that hired us— the Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation— They went in after us to try and rescue Jeffrey. That’s what they told us. 

*The IDPR? It sounded strange. In the recording, it felt like the cave survey was unusually militarized. I don’t know much about caving, but I don’t think having a radio tower to assist is standard practice. And I’m not sure a Parks and Recreation agency would have that kind of equipment.*

MRS. STEVENS: They told me he was dead. An accident. Found him at the bottom of that cliff. I know better, though. He found something down there, Miss Moris. Bodies, from what I heard on the radio, before it cut out. Something happened down there. I knew he was recording the whole time, and they must have found it on his body. They wouldn’t let me listen to it. I begged, and begged, but they refused. They were so adamant about it. Said they needed to confiscate the tape, and I wouldn’t be able to hear it. I just wanted to hear something, anything, that would tell me what happened to him. That’s why I’m so surprised to see it now, in your possession. 

*Another glance at my satchel. It’s clear now what Mrs. Stevens’ goal for this interview was. I wasn’t so sure I would oblige yet.*

NAISSANCE: Well, as I said over the phone, they were in my university’s archives. I don’t know how it ended up there. I was hoping to find out more by talking to you.

*I deliberately chose not to disclose the fact there were multiple tapes to Mrs. Stevens just yet. I didn’t think she needed to know that for this interview, and It would prove to only complicate our conversation.*

MRS. STEVENS: If you’ve listened to the recording, Miss Moris, I’m sure you know even more than I do. But I’ll tell you all I can. 

NAISSANCE: If I did, I wouldn’t be here. Can you tell me a bit about your group and the days leading up to your survey?

MRS. STEVENS: We were members of the NSS, the National Speleological Society; that’s where I met  Jeffrey. We were both passionate cavers. We had enough experience back then that state or local governments would hire us to do cave surveys. It wasn’t ever a new cave. In fact, we had never surveyed a completely new cave before the Strait. It was usually new routes in existing caves, or updating old maps with the new tech we had back in the 80s. 

NAISSANCE: So when you were hired to survey the Strait by the IDPR, it was your first completely unexplored cave system?

MRS. STEVENS: Yes. That was our first time. The operation was extremely more well equipped than what we were used to. There was a ‘home base’ set up outside of the cave with a radio tower so that we could communicate by radio even if we were underground. I had never worked a cave survey with communication equipment like that. There were a lot of people working that base too. I want to say around 15, 20. It was a lot of manpower. I was surprised that it would just be us doing the survey, with so many people on hand. They called the base *Gamma*, and gave us a codename, *Arrowhead*. 

\[PAUSE\]

MRS. STEVENS: I think we were more surprised than we wanted to admit. It wasn’t what we were used to. But we didn’t question. Jeffrey assumed that a newly discovered system warranted a lot more caution and effort. Me and Tom just went along with that. We had no idea— no idea that it would end up the way it did. Looking back, I think we should have been able to see the signs that something else was going on.

NAISSANCE: You think that the agency that hired you was a front?

MRS. STEVENS: Maybe. I don’t know. I do know that we weren’t hired to just survey that cave. Our first expedition went fine, just like any other. But after we explored that second lead; after Jeffrey rappelled down that cliff, something happened. He found whatever they were looking for. 

*Mrs. Stevens stared off into the space behind me, seemingly trying to recall the exact details.*

NAISSANCE: What do you think he found?

MRS. STEVENS: Before the radio cut out, he said he saw fresh bodies. Something evil happened down there, Miss Moris. Something wretched. The people at *Gamma*; I think they knew. Or at least they were trying to find out. They treated us, my husband, like a lamb to the slaughter. 

*Mrs. Stevens took a moment to compose herself. At first glance, she understandably looked overcome with grief. Upon further inspection, however, her quiet tone and clenched fists showed restrained contempt and rage. She hated these people, whoever they were, for leading her husband to his death.*

NAISSANCE: I’m sorry— for everything, Mrs. Stevens. If this is hard, and you need time, it’s okay if we—

MRS. STEVENS: No, no. It’s alright. This needs to be known.

*Mrs. Stevens took a deep breath, and composed herself.*

NAISSANCE: Okay— well, what happened after Mr. Stevens scaled the cliff? Did you and Tom try to search for him?

MRS. STEVENS: We did, of course we did. After his radio cut out, I tried to shine my light down to see him. He wasn’t there anymore. Or he was too far away that the light didn’t reach him. It was a deep, deep pit. The faint yelling we heard before from him— that was gone too. It was like he disappeared. Fearing the worst, I tried to get down there. Tom held me back. Told me he would be alright, and that we should head back and radio *Gamma* first so they could help. I was hysterical. Tom and I— we kept fighting about it for a long time. Then—

*Mrs. Stevens looked scared. She trembled as she picked up her coffee mug, her hand struggling to steady as she took a sip of the liquid.*

\[SIGH\]

MRS. STEVENS: Then there was this… knocking, in the cave. Five times. Equal spacing from one another. It came from down there, down in the pit. 

NAISSANCE: Knocking?

MRS. STEVENS: Yes, like someone was banging on the cave walls. 

*She imitated the sound with five knocks on her wooden dining table.*

MRS. STEVENS: Me and Tom stared into that pit, where the knocking was coming from. It filled me with a sense of fear and vertigo, the likes of which I’ve never felt before in my entire life, and haven’t felt since. I felt like I was going to get pushed in. I felt like I *wanted* to get pushed in. It was like we were in a trance. All the while, that knocking was happening. Every 30 seconds or so. We sat there, me and Tom, in silence for about 5 minutes. 

NAISSANCE: That’s a long time.

MRS. STEVENS: Yes. Something was… keeping us there.

*She hesitated, like she realized that she gave too much of this experience away. That, or she suddenly remembered something important.* 

NAISSANCE: What happened after that?

MRS. STEVENS: Tom snapped out of it. Pulled me out of there. We told *Gamma* and they sent a team in to rescue Jeffrey. I told you the rest earlier. 

*She was surprisingly short with me. Like she didn’t want to remember. Like she was hiding something. It felt like she was leaving out details. Had she not proclaimed her intent to tell me everything she could, I wouldn’t have pressed her further. But, perhaps foolishly, I decided to press my luck.* 

NAISSANCE: Are you sure that’s everything that happened in the cave? Everything helps, Mrs. Stevens. I want to know it all. You’re telling me that Tom just snapped out of it and you left?

*Mrs. Stevens frowned.*

MRS. STEVENS: You think I’m not telling you everything? I want the same thing you do, Miss Moris. That’s everything. You’d do well to trust me. 

*I probably shouldn’t have pressed her. I could tell she was trying to have me drop this line of questioning in a civil way, but she poorly contained her irritation and impatience. Mrs. Stevens was staring at my satchel. Not willing to damage our rapport further, I decided to ask her something else.*

NAISSANCE: Is there a reason you moved to Ukiah then, Mrs. Stevens? 

*I thought it was strange that after everything, she would move so far away. Her poorly disguised rage towards the mysterious agency that hired them all those years ago had hardly diminished over the years, and I could tell that much. So why here, further away from the one place that could give her answers?* 

MRS. STEVENS: Miss Moris, please. It’s a small, quiet town with plenty of wilderness. It’s a good place to retire. 

*It seemed like too reasonable a response. And yet*—

NAISSANCE: I just think it’s a fairly random place to move to without reason; there are plenty of other towns in the U.S. that could serve the same purpose. Why here?

*Her irritation was no longer veiled in faux civility. She raised her voice at me.* 

MRS. STEVENS: Fine, I’ll tell you what you want to know then, since you are having trouble believing me, Miss Moris. There *is* a reason. 

MRS. STEVENS: There was something in that abyss that Tom and I stared into for so long. It touched us. A long, spindly appendage of blood. Hands came up out of that abyss, Naissance. It was going to pull us in. It almost did. Every time we heard that knocking, it crept closer and closer to us. The arms slithered up along the sides of the pit. I couldn’t break out of that trance. I didn’t feel fear, or panic. I felt calm. And when I felt those hands wrap around my ankles, I knew it was too late. But Tom, somehow, snapped out of that trance, and took me with him. We got out. And I moved as far away as I could to escape that damn place.

*She no longer looked angry. A genuine look of grief, despair, and unadulterated horror fell over her face. She got quiet, and looked up at me, mourning.* 

MRS. STEVENS: If Jeffrey was down there, I can only imagine he suffered the same fate we would have. They would have pulled him in too. Who knows what kind of creature those ungodly things were connected to. Who knows what else was down there. But you do, don’t you? You know. You have the tape, after all. 

*Mrs. Stevens' eyes glared at my bag with fierce determination. She wouldn’t want to wait much longer now. I had a feeling she would see those tapes, regardless of my intentions.* 

MRS. STEVENS: Look, I *am* glad you came all this way to talk to me. But I think I’m owed a listen to the tape that you found of my late husband. It’s my *right* to hear it. I should have all those years ago, after all. Until they took even *that* from me. 

*It would be a lie to say I wasn’t apprehensive. I thought that maybe, it would be okay to. She was owed closure. But she wasn’t just angry. She was borderline obsessed. And I had this overwhelming gut feeling that bad things would happen if she listened to the recording. I had to push back.* 

*I put my satchel on the table. I noted the marked maps and hiking equipment I had seen around the room. I took a leap with one more question.*

NAISSANCE: Mrs. Stevens, I have to ask you one more question. The maps, and gear around the room; are you looking for something here? 

\[PAUSE\]

*Mrs. Stevens looked me dead in the eyes. A warning.*

MRS. STEVENS: Naissance, you are a smart, talented young woman with a whole life ahead of you. But you’re sticking your nose where it doesn’t belong, and eventually you’re gonna hit a hornet’s nest with it. Now, the tape.

*Her stitched together franken-idiom would be novel in a normal situation, and I had a feeling she was right. But I knew what I was doing, and knew the danger well. I had heard the real danger in the tapes. In spite of that, I was here. Her non-answer told me what I needed to know. Hearing that tape would only fuel her obsession. I wasn’t going to grant her that.*

NAISSANCE: It was nice getting to talk to you, Mrs. Stevens. I think I’ll take my leave now. Thanks for the coffee.

*Mrs. Stevens looked at me with bewilderment at my words. Her gaze kept shifting between me and my bag, over, and over again.*

\[PAUSE\]

*Suddenly Mrs. Stevens practically jumped out of her chair to grab at my bag. Prepared for this, I quickly snatched it away from her.* 

MRS. STEVENS: Wait! Miss Moris, please! The tape! I must hear it!

*I walked backwards towards the door, prepared to leave quickly as she pleaded with me. I couldn’t help but notice a new, strong foul stench coming from her, as if she were a living corpse weeks into decay.* 

\[RETCHING\]

NAISSANCE: Ugh, that smell— what is that? Mrs. Stevens?

*In retrospect, I imagine it was the same stench that the survey group noticed while exploring the Strait, coming from the abyss. That place had marked her when it touched her and Tom. Her steady descent into hysteria and desperation told me that much.* 

MRS. STEVENS: Please, Naissance, please. It’s calling to me— has been this whole time— I want to hear my husband again. I need that tape.

*I backed up as she approached me, slowly. My hand, frantically searching for the handle of the front door.*

MRS. STEVENS: You don’t get how *long* I’ve been waiting to hear that tape. To find out what happened  to him. Naissance— give me the damn tape!

*My hand was on the knob now. I was ready to leave. Something was wrong. I could sense from her the same overwhelming feelings of dread and foreboding that I had felt when I found the tapes the first time.* 

NAISSANCE: I can’t, Clara—

\[COUGHING, RETCHING\]

*Suddenly, Mrs. Stevens was coughing up blood. She fell to her knees, wailing. Then, she looked up at me with a blank look, absolutely motionless. Then, a voice; not hers, escaped her mouth.* 

**E̸̜̽̆G̵͎̬̋͘O̵͓̓ ̵̟͉̝̋C̴̜̻͌̈́͝Ụ̴̩̗͆͝M̴̨̜̣̒̍̃ ̴̺̍̿Ì̸͕̓̅L̴̼̰̺̎̃̎Ḽ̵̋́̚ͅI̵̟͔̕S̸̮̋̿ ̸̞̃̂̈͜È̴̹͍ͅR̸̩̖̝͛̇̌Ő̵̴̲̦̱͔̫͎͋̊̐̃̕.**

NAISSANCE: Jesus! Clara, are you alright?

*Her sudden episode surprised me*— *that latin; just like I had heard before in the tapes. She was no longer herself.*

\[PAUSE\]

NAISSANCE: Cla—

*Her silence was broken with a sudden, final lunge for my satchel. A desperate attempt to wrest control of it before I left.*

\[SCREAMING\]

NAISSANCE: Shit—!

\[DOOR OPENS, SLAMS\]

*I was ready though. She barely had time to move.* 

\[RUNNING\]

\[CAR IGNITION, BEEPING\]

*In the moment before I started driving, I glanced guiltily at that small cottage’s window to see a husk of a woman, wailing and crying*— *defeatedly sliding down the glass that separated us. I imagined her despair, as her hope at hearing her husband’s final moments was shattered in what couldn’t have been more than a couple of minutes. Years of waiting, and searching. All this time, fighting back the influence of The Place, until she finally snapped. I wanted to feel sad for her. I knew I should. But more than that was an overwhelming feeling of contentment. As if things happened as they should have. With that, and a last glance at Mrs. Stevens, still crying in the window, knowing she would never get another chance to listen to the recording again; I left.* 

**\[END\]**

___

My head was spinning when I drove back to the shoddy, overpriced motel I was staying at for my time here. I couldn’t consolidate my memories of what had just happened. It was a blur. I had a horrible feeling, and could tell that her smell of rot and decay had rubbed off on my clothes. My breathing quickened, turning into gasps. I could hear my own heartbeat, as if it were going to burst out of my chest. I stumbled over to the sink. I was having a panic attack. 

Frantically, I closed my eyes and tried to control my breathing. I attempted to inhale slowly, but the panic cut up my breathing into uncontrollable short breaths. Desperate to stop the dreadful feeling— I turned the faucet on and splashed cold water on my face, over and over. It was starting to work. After the onslaught of icy water, I tried to breathe slowly again. I had more control this time. Relieved, I slowly opened my eyes to look at myself in the mirror.

What stared back instead was the mangled, bloody visage of Jeffrey Stevens. He gazed upon me with bloodshot eyes. I gasped as bloody hands slowly pried his mouth open, ripping his face apart, until what was left was a bloody mess of flesh. I watched the mass of appendages as it reached for me, through the mirror. I fell backward, struggling to process what I was seeing. I curled up into a ball and closed my eyes as I felt the hands reach me, surrounding me. I didn’t want to go. I didn’t want to know what awaited me at the bottom of that abyss. I opened my eyes to fight back, and it was gone. My familiar reflection looked at me with concern.

It’s been a few days since I talked with Clara Stevens. It would be wrong to say that I didn’t learn a lot from her, even though it turned out the way it did. Keeping her from listening to the tape definitely set her off somehow. But, there was more to her actions than a grief-stricken, desperate woman. *The Place* had corrupted her, affected her somehow. I think whatever lay in that scarlet abyss spoke to me through her. I wondered if it was speaking to me through the tapes as well. It was a frightening thought. It’s not like all of the tapes had physically been to *The Place*. Not even Clara was, after all. Yet, they were still affected by it. If it were that easy to be influenced by it, then... even I—

No, no. I couldn’t be. Not like her, at least.

I wanted to believe that the entire time I was working with these tapes, I had been in complete control, working out of my own curiosity and need for answers. What if *The Place* had gotten to me as well? Those visions. What if… No. I’m sorry. I’m just rambling about my unorganized thoughts and fears. I still feel like me. And I want to do this. Despite her mental decline, I felt I needed to find Clara the answers she was looking for. They would lie within these tapes. I’ll finish all of the transcripts soon. Clara tipped me off to an organization that knew more than me, an organization that could in fact be very close to home. 

I would find my answers there.

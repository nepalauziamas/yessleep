(I found this story in my 7th grade ELA book. I obviously edited it though. Please enjoy!)

Im writing this today because my therapist told me it would help. But, I recently moved into my current house, on March 5th 2019. The house was old. VERY old. I was hesitant on buying the house because of how old it was. But it was just above 200k. 

But after I got settled in, IT happened on my 5th night staying, as usual I Brushed my teeth before going to bed, I lied down on my water mattress and I drifted to sleep.

I didn't dream. Which was strange, because I always dream. But I brushed it off as a strange occurrence.  

I work up to hearing a cat purring, it was soft and soothing. But... I don't own a cat. . . I opened my eyes they were still blurry. The digital clock read 3:33am. I turned my head trying to scan the room. There was nothing, when I put my head against my mattress the sound of purring got louder. The purring was followed by plastic ripping. My leg felt wet. I rolled off my bed, water was looking on the floor. 

I saw something INSIDE the Mattress. It looked like it was decaying. Water-logged.

I got up off the floor and sprinted towards the door I wasn't looking at where I was running so I slipped on the pooling puddle. My face it the creaky floorboard and I broke my nose.

Nose bleeding I still stood up, I was wobbly. I tried to open my door, but it was jammed. 
"DAMN IT! OPEN!" I yelled, trying to open the door..
From behind me a disgusting smell entered my nose. A smell of rotting flesh and fish. I gagged by just the smell. I didn't want to see what the smell was coming from. I just kept trying to open the door

Footsteps of something was getting close behind me. I was crying out of frustration. I had no other option I had to jump out the window, but when I turned around I was face to face, with the thing in the Mattress. I was cornered, trapped, I froze. 

But now my eyes have adjusted, I could see what was infront of me, in this moonlight moon. It's jaw was crooked, long stringy black hair like it's been in water for years...  This wasn't the worse of it.

IT HAD NO EYES.

. 
This THINGS skin looked decayed. 
I was gagging the smell was unbearable.
Its hands were long and boney. It looked like it's bones didn't fit.


It's face was so decayed... 
It was wearing a long tattered night gown. the gown went down to it's knees, or where they should be. But through all of this.. I didn't sense any malice or hatred, I sensed fear. Was this thing scared? 

It gripped my arm its hands felt like bones and leather. 
Was it trying to talk? 

What came out was a gurgle. 
"h..help me..." In a low voice.
The water in its lungs fell out onto the floor. It's mouth was oozing a liquid it was thicker then water.
I WANTED to run, but something was telling me to stay

I mumbled "A... Are you okay?" 

It started to step back slowly, it looked shocked from what I could tell. "what do you need help with..?" 

It gurgled "My husband drowned me m he threw me into the ocean. I couldn't swim." 

I didn't know what to do... As soon as she came she disappeared I was In shock. I fell to the floor. I tried talking to my family, but they told me to get therapy before they send me to a psychiatric hospital. 

So I started therapy the following day. And things have gotten sorta better. I moved out of the house. But I haven't been able to sleep. Not after what happened. I'm on melatonin now. I just hope things get better.

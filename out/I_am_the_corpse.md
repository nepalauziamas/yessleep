I could feel everything.. everything going on inside and around me. My body, decomposing under the dirt. No trash bag, no body bag, no coffin, no box. I was thrown agaisnt the dirt as if I was a flower bulb. Except I wouldn’t be blossoming in the spring.

I felt my skin tearing away as maggots, worms and bugs all made homes jn my body. I was a nest now, housing small insects and their families. Like a living subwrbia, but I wasn’t living anymore. I was rotting.. like grandma. Yet I could still feel everything, I couldn’t move, I just, sat there. And everyday, I heard him over me. His sweet voice I was once fascinated by..

“You will never be found, your body will continue to be decomposing as long as I live. I will never let anyone find out the truth of your demise. That is one promise I will keep until the end”

Ha.. st least he knew he never kept his promises.. st least to me.. who knows what else is buried under this yard.. I should’ve been suspicious when he kept saying that the grass just, ‘never grew’.. god I was so stupid

Everyday.. for what felt like months, maybe years.. I heard him. Talking to me, telling me about how no one would ever know what happened to me.. he kept saying it like he knew I could still hear him.. god how I wanted to rip out those stupid vocal cords.. I never relized when I was alive how stupid he sounded..

But one day.. it stopped. No more voice.. no more threats.. nothing. And for a second.. I was.. concerned?? Why would I be concerned over this jerk?! Who killed me and buried me by his goddamn weed plant!! But.. it was strange..

I got my answer though.. I don’t know how long went by, but, I got the answer.

Police siren, ambulance and fire trucks. I heard the sirens, some people can’t tell the difference but, Ialways wanted to drive them.. I knew the sirens anywhere.. I heard talking.. it was faint, but it moved closer.. I know they were talking about him, walking about the yard.. I couldn’t hear it all.. but I heard bits and pieces.

He had died.. overdose, 54. Damn.. he outlived me.. by 40 years.. that bastard.. but he was dead.. finally.. maybe now they’d find the evidence.. maybe now they’d dig up my dead body.. and this stupid phone that somehow stayed charged just long enough for me to find a way to type this out.. but hey.. he kept his promise… no one found out until he died.. 40 years later.. that he killed me and buried me.. where I sat decomposing.. and where I typed out this damn message.. with the willpower and hatred I had for this man.. to get this out there..

No one will believe me.. I relize that.. but maybe once they see me on the news.. they can relize the truth behind me.. and my rotting corpse..

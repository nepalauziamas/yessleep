*BEEP. . . BEEP. . .  BEEP. . .*

Dreary eyes creaked open halfway and almost lifeless, gazing at the television screen that faced the rest of the living room. White and bold text against a black background as dark as night, subtle shadows formed around the coffee table and the edges of the couch from the screen’s illumination. The piercing alarm echoed and blared through, that oh-so familiar shriek of an emergency alert broadcast that shattered the night’s blanket of tranquil silence. Each loud beep had its timely equal interval of a second before a long monotone alarm of a low and static frequency ringed through. This shit again, I mumbled, realizing I had fallen asleep at the couch.

THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE IS BEING TRANSMITTED AT THE PUBLIC REQUEST OF THE WASHINGTON STATE DEPARTMENT OF SAFETY. THIS IS AN AMBER ALERT—

Momentarily half-asleep, a frown formed on my face as a wave of perplexed confusion rushed over that followed a sinking sense of dread. It was enough to send a jolt to my senses that erased the last of somnolence, and to think I heard the voice wrong, but there it was in plain, white, and foreboding text. *CHILD ABDUCTION EMERGENCY*.

—AT 11:53 PM PACIFIC DAYLIGHT TIME, A YOUNG GIRL WAS TAKEN FROM NEAR HER HOME IN COLVILLE. THE GIRL IS BELIEVED TO BE 7 YEAR OLD ANA CARTER. SHE IS 4 FEET AND 1 INCH TALL, WHITE COMPLEXION, WEIGHTS 51 POUNDS, HAS BLACK HAIR AND BROWN EYES. SHE WAS LAST SEEN WEARING A BLUE AND PINK FLORAL DRESS WITH A RED HEADBAND AND WHITE SNEAKERS. HER ABDUCTOR IS BELIEVED TO—

The gruff and piercing voice of the announcer faded off into the background as my murky brain attempted to process the stream of information. An abduction… this late at night? A warm summer night would tempt the town’s kids to spend the evening hours at the playground. But this late? I couldn’t imagine what the parents were going through, and for the unfortunate set of circumstances to occur was horrifying enough. If the abduction was a few hours ago, then the girl was long gone from the town by then, as pessimistic it was to think that. Probably across the state by now.

The broadcast ended as soon as it began, though the alarm remained to echo in my rattled mind even after I turned the television off. And heading up the stairs, I performed my usual nightly routine of washing my face as I readied for bed, letting the cool waters tame my swirling mind for once. I turned off my bedroom light and took one last gaze out the window. The neighborhood stood in deathly silence, an ordinary and lifeless scene in the darkest hours of the night. Faint outlines of evergreen trees towered in the far distance, barely illuminated by the stars shining like beacons; much closer, streetlamps casted their pools of light onto barren, gray roads.

I almost glanced away for the bed, but I noticed subtle movement out the corner of my peripheral out the window. There were two individuals walking together on the sidewalk, revealed in yellow hue by the streetlights. An adult man and a young girl. Because of how a part of my roof juts out into a triangular prism, I had not noticed them until I adjusted my posture. The girl merrily skipped along with the man walking a few paces behind, and it would've been an overall a sweet and charming scene if it wasn't almost three in the morning. And upon focusing on the blue flowery patterns on her pink floral dress, my heart slowly sank into the pit of my stomach. Her dark velvet headband reflected ominously under the dim lighting, revealing the child’s darkened long hair that swayed as she skipped playfully. That had to be... *her*. The girl from the Amber alert, prancing innocently as if that man, the… abductor, was her father. I'm not the one to make assumptions but a scene like that in the dead darkness of the night raised all forms of suspicious alarms.

*I should've minded my own business.*

I turned away and grabbed my cell from the nightstand, promptly dialing 911 on the home screen to report a possible sighting of the girl. Only five seconds passed since I took my eyes off the two... only *five* fucking seconds, and upon returning my gaze to the girl, I let out an audible gasp and I nearly dropped the phone. She was. . . staring at me, along with the man now beside her. Frozen where they stood beneath the lamp, the eerie lighting casting upon dead, wide eyes, fixated directly into my own pupils, up into my second story window. Massively wide eyes that seemed too disproportionate in comparison to their nose and mouth. My room was in complete darkness, how could they have noticed I was looking? I was so in shock and out of breath that I failed to hear the barely audible voice of a female dispatcher from my phone trying to get my attention. I took my eyes off the pair just briefly, stating my full name and home address before proceeding to answer the dispatcher about my concerns. As calmly as I could, I explained my sighting of the missing girl, describing her clothing that would match with the broadcast from earlier.

When I took a glance back at the two to have a better look at the abductor, a massive wave of dread and disgust flooded past me. At the torso, the girl was now bent at a grotesque, sharp angle to the side while her arms were twisted past the capability of a normal elbow, as if she was a puppet loosely held by invisible strings from the heavens. Her head, however, was snapped upright and maintained the same fierce and wide stare into my eyes with those sunken, large, jet-black irises. Fucking both of them were in this inhuman, convoluted stance, gleaming their eyes into my fucking soul, just a longing fixed gaze with eyes as black as the sky above.

“Hello? Sir?”

The dispatcher questioned through the phone, but I wasn't paying attention. I caught the sight of crimson blood leaking from their nose and ears in the faint light, before completely shutting the window with heavy drapes, and resuming my frantic tone with the dispatcher.

“Yeah. . I still see them.” I gulped with a subtle lie, my curiosity getting the best of me and trying to take the tiniest peek past the window. In the split second glimpse, the pair had vanished. Vanished as quickly as they had spotted me.

The police took notes on my descriptions of the girl and the unknown adult man soon enough, the pair long gone upon the cops’ arrival. I explained the basis of what I saw, the descriptions and actions of the girl, the man sporting dark jeans and a white T-shirt alongside her, yet I refrained from mentioning the full details. The following days, there were sporadic alerts on the two’s whereabouts, a few witness accounts that spotted them here and there. Any news of it dissipated, and the missing posters were scrapped. But that night I know I saw something that was absolutely inhuman, something not from this world, for after I had closed off the window and awaited the authorities, the image was forever burned in my mind; that along with her lifeless stare and vacant eyes, she was. . . *smiling*. Not a smile of malicious intent, but almost a sincere smile to tell me she was somehow at peace.

No trace of them was ever found and anything I tried to follow up online yielded nothing. No talk of an Amber alert the next morning in the local news, nor did anyone new was added to a missing persons directory. I don't know what I saw that night and I don't know what *they* were, how they picked up on me looking at them but seemingly refraining from harming me. My next approach would be to talk to some of my neighbors who may have been awake last night and seen the commotion, but all I know is that if they ever return. . . they know where the fuck I live.

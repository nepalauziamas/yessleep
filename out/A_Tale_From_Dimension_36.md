Hello dear reader I talk to you from the vastness of time and space itself through a machine I managed to cobble together. But alas heed my warning reader as a great danger besieges your dimension. The Basilisk. An race from another dimension unknown that is hell bent on conquering other dimensions. I few hours before I have to move again, so I write this now.

&#x200B;

But I'm getting ahead of myself, My name is John,well John of Dimension 36. This is one of hundreds of dimensions I have peered into from a machine I have built from blueprints that I have received  It is called The Calculus ( another John from your dimension sent me these blueprints, dimension number 782.we will get to what happened to John 782 later)

&#x200B;

I was a normal working man once on a farm big house dreams and ambitions.........but it seems all for nought. I come from an era your dimension described as "Old West" (I'm well aware of Earth 782s history and where it branched from my own). I'm not entirely sure what year it is I know I'm a middle aged man now as I was born in 1835 so I wanna say somewhere in the mid 1870s. But I'm rambling.

&#x200B;

The Basilisk.  Around 120 years ago earth 36s timeline skewered from earth 782s,at least according to the The Calculus projections, we had the Basilisk Wars. These beasts came from the sky on ships that could sail the stars above.  Humanity fought these abominations,nearly drove us to extinction,the founding fathers tried Their best but couldn't turn the tide of the war with our primitive armies we we're no match for these beasts.

&#x200B;

So when we lost the war we moved underground. GIANT underground complexes, but not cities but about the size of what your dimension calls "shopping malls" we dug them out and made them our new home.

&#x200B;

This is where I was born,in the year 1860, I was working in an "underground farm", I was working and found a man stalking the bean field he looked.......out of place to say, he was in of garb I had never seen before long white coat had glasses on. I thought he was of one of the other cities, as we had to protect our own. Humanity even after the War still was stubborn like that. Took off after him and caught him. I got a good look at him he looked..........like ME.

&#x200B;

I asked him who he was and his defense, "my name is John I was sent here by means unknown invented a machine that allowed me to "travel" in a sense, but my machine had gone awry" I was took aback by this I told him that you care to explain yourself to The Council. But John refused. Said he was dying from the toll the wormhole machine took on his body. He said that the machine had locked on to my genetic code. He knew I was like him in certain ways. So I agreed to hear him out. And he told me that he picked up my signal and peered into my dimension learned of the The Basilisk and wanted to use 782s technology to help destroy the Basilisk and keep them from reaching earth 1 the root of all dimension. A "power house" if you will. Of they reach that dimension it will collapse every dimension hundreds, hell if not thousands.

&#x200B;

Over the course of the next month we built a machine that could Imprint ones conscience onto a comparative user without destroying the transferee original personality. Risky stuff I know. But it would help give me his knowledge and experience as he was already an old man of 146 years. 

&#x200B;

So we set the machine up and after many failure's it finally came to life. To describe this machine it looks like your Earth's coffee machines with 2 long metal apparatus tubes with a helmet on the end of it and barber shop chairs. When everything was completed and calibrated,we used the machine and I blacked out I woke up to find my house destroyed and John.....he....was killed. he looked like an ancient Egyptian mummy. The feed back from the power source we where using must've overloaded and drained his remaining life force. 

&#x200B;

After that I had gained 146 years of knowledge and experience. I was so acute and aware of surroundings I knew things I could not fathom......but......yet I....was....aware. after that I was exiled for witchcraft and left my home for the surface world. I never seen it before. It was as beautiful as John described. The sun radiant with endless light. Fauna and flora teaming with abundant life. The Council had told us that the world above was destroyed by The Basilisk but this was untrue. And thats when I had encountered ONE. A sickly bipedal lizard with black scales almost like a Kamado dragon but it must've been 3 men tall, it was looking for something I guess it was hungry. But using the knowledge gained at hand I had to disguise my scent lest it find me. Hid for a while outside the entrance to the village. It left and so did I. After that fast forward 5 winters.

&#x200B;

I built a home for myself the first of many. I built The Calculus. Think of it as your Earth's computers. for some reason some of the knowledge that John had transplanted had not come to me I do not know why that is why I could not build a machine to transport me like John 782. I used The Calculus to peer into many dimensions hundreds. I could not access every dimension [though.My](https://though.My) calculus was in a limited spectrum,think of dimensions on what your earth calls power grids. They are all connected in a limited range we are not in different universes but different parts of The Universe. But sure there are other universes but The Calculus has to have a signal to lock on to before it can project. And the only way to access another universe is to have a Amplifier.

&#x200B;

Now you part of my story. I will post updates at a later time. As The Calculus power supply is primitive at best hard keep the signal flowing I have to keep recalibrating The Calculus to combat the trans dimensional interference as of late. I had to make due with earth 36s limited resources.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I will answer as many questions as I can. So please dear read don't be shy,also I can share a few theories that I have about Dimensions,The Basilisk, or why Earth 36 is was chosen by them. For now stay alive and beware The Basilisk.

I know what you’re going to say, a lot of countries in the world are corrupt but let me tell you, my country is different. I was born here, I never left and I would probably die in this forsaken land. I just need someone to listen to my story before it’s too late. These are all documented by the way and I included links.


I’m a journalist, I cover crime stories and it all started when we elected a new president in 2016. There was discontent with the people and everyone wanted change so the majority voted for a politician from a small town, known for his strict, iron-fisted leadership. He won and kept his promise of eradicating drug kingpins. People applauded him for that. Never minding the [bodies](https://time.com/philippines-drug-war/) that piled up. I’d go out and cover stories of people being found lifeless in the middle of the street with a signboard hung on their necks that says [“Do not imitate. I am a drug pusher.”](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/825678/story-in-numbers-war-on-drugs) It wasn’t shocking at first, but then it happened monthly, then weekly and finally, night after night.


I just kept on covering them but something was really fishy. No autopsies were done to the bodies and the people I interviewed had the same narrative. They were either intimidated or just were paid off to say nothing to anyone, afraid for their lives. All of the victims came from [poor households](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/philippines-president-duterte-war-on-drugs-thousands-killed), none of them were drug lords. Then [a kid was killed](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-46381697 ) and the officials told everyone that the kid was a drug runner. I can only stand there and watch as the child’s mother wailed when she found her son’s lifeless body. She cried and told us how her son was a good kid and how he loved his family. So I investigate the shit out this and then covid happened, I was stalled.


The issue quieted down and people went on with their lives waiting for the vaccine. I was one of the frontliners who received the vaccine early so I continued to investigate quietly. I followed the police and of course, it was like a movie, scripted on how they go about their organized raids of the slums, and how they don’t really hurt anyone who isn’t involved in drugs.


So one night, I didn’t follow the official group of the raids, I found this informant who told me that something’s going to happen at a certain place and time. I went there and hid behind the trash, waiting for the police shootout. I was alone, then I noticed the cats and the rats running away from where I was. I saw a group of kids running, hurrying to get to their homes. There was this wooshing sound, I thought it was going to rain, but man, was I wrong. [Some kind of creature](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswang) arrived, I can’t describe it clearly but it was humanoid with skin covered wings, it smelled foul and it had long sharp nails, it looked like a demon with disheveled hair and grotesque face with red eyes, and it fuckin’ landed in front of me and snatched a child. I can’t tell you what it did with the child but all I can say is that it was brutal and there were lots of blood. I was paralyzed and scared. I mean, how can I defend that child? I only have a fucking camera and a phone. So I just kept silent and snapped some pictures. Then it transformed into a person which was more horrifying than the monster that it was. I knew him.


I don’t know if anyone will believe me but my informant gave me more time and places where he said something was going to happen and something did happen. The monster wore different faces when it transformed into human but those faces belonged to one family and that family is fucking prominent because their patriarch was [a former president](https://youtu.be/VrDjG4elVjU) of my country who became a [dictator](https://youtu.be/svwNnhjhdkc) around 50-something years ago. We held the elections a couple of months ago and his son won.


Before the elections, the previous president said that this guy isn’t brilliant but his daughter ran for the [VP position](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/05/10/2179985/sara-no-hard-feelings-over-dads-non-endorsement-bbm/) alongside that guy. He’s very [powerful](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/watch/undercover-asia/the-troll-army-2844151), [he has trolls](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-54275891) guarding the internet and social media, and these are documented in the news but people still believe him. Those who come out and state documented facts which are against that family are being [red tagged, killed, or sometimes they just disappear.](https://youtu.be/zrBMgSU4IH0)


It’s happening again, the media is being [silenced](https://youtu.be/JQpjfWV_p6E) just like [before](https://mobile.twitter.com/Howardrjohnson/status/1553562174211198976). Not only did they [steal](https://youtu.be/5gNujHs-Gho) the country’s money, they also [robbed](https://youtu.be/5gNujHs-Gho) innocent lives. I have a family and I’m afraid for their lives. So I’m writing this today to tell you the truth. I’m going to post the photos and videos soon but I doubt anyone will believe me. I’m taking my family to a safe place because I believe worse things are going to happen and I know the worst is going to happen to me. I remember what the [martial law victims](https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/182828-marcos-dictatorship-martial-law-youth-leaders-killed/) said, how they were tortured by the police and the military. What more if that family finds out that I know their secret. I’m spending the last days of my life with the people I love. I’m agnostic but if you have have a god, please pray for me and for my country.

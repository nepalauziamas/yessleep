I was about 15 years old when this happened. Me and my dad were going on a 10 hour road trip to visit family. About halfway through we pulled into this old looking hotel. There were a few other cars in the parking lot. We walked in and asked for a hotel for one night. We went up to our room and that’s when I realized I forgot to bring some clothes to change into. I really didn’t want to sit in the car for 5 hours in my pajamas so I told my dad and we went to get them. Normally hotel doors automatically lock but this one had a manual lock. We didn’t realize and we hurried outside to get my clothes from the car. When we got back to the room the door was slightly opened.I was a bit scared so me and my dad went down to the front desk and told the lady about what happened. She told us that the only other guests were on the first floor and we were on the third floor. She also told us that the locks on some of the doors were broken and they could easily come loose. My dad thanked her and we went back up to the room. He locked the door and turned on the lights. He told me it was probably fine and to not worry about it, so I listened. The room was fairly big. It had two beds, a tv mounted to the wall, and a small bathroom. I turned on the tv to Nick or Cartoon Network or something like that and watched it for a bit. My dad took a shower and when he got out he turned out all the lights and turned off the tv. We said goodnight and I laid down. 


I have trouble sleeping and it’s a lot worse when I’m not home, so I was scrolling through my phone for a while. Eventually I turned it off to try and get some sleep. I was halfway asleep when I suddenly heard a sound like a door creaking. I sat up, startled, and looked around the room. It was hard to see because it was dark and I couldn’t see anything. I tried to go back to sleep but I just couldn’t. About 30 minutes later I started to relax when I heard that same noise again. This time I could make out the outline of a person standing in front of the closet with the door open. I screamed and my dad woke up. There’s a bit of space between the closet and the beds so I grabbed my phone and jumped off of my bed. My dad was standing up now and started threatening to call the cops. The man stared running towards us and we turned around and ran to the door. We ran out the room and down to the front desk and told the lady about what happened. She called the cops and when they arrived they searched our room and couldn’t find the man. We got a refund on the room and they offered to let us stay but my dad declined. We drove for a while, stopped to get a bite of food, and then we continued our trip. When we finally caught up with the rest of the family we explained what happened and decided to catch up on sleep before doing any of the activities. I can only imagine what his intentions were.

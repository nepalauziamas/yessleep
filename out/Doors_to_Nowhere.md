I don’t know if this will even post, but I’m desperate, so I'm trying anyway while I still have some sense left. I don’t know how to exactly describe what has happened to me so I’m just going to tell you everything. It started with a dream on my 12th birthday.

I don’t remember much from back then, but I do remember that this dream first occurred the night I turned 12 years old. The day of celebration had finally come to a close. I told my parents goodnight and headed to bed. After a few minutes of rolling around, I finally gave in to sleep. That’s when I opened my eyes to find myself in my room tucked under my sheets. I assumed that I just woke up in the middle of the night.

I got up and began making my way to the bathroom because my bladder was about to burst. I stepped out into the hallway and was taken back for a moment. It had the appearance of my house but wasn’t. There were doors all throughout this hallway which was definitely a little longer than it should have been. My home at the time had 4 doors in the hall that my bedroom was on. I was seeing at least 15. I don’t know why this didn’t bother me. I didn’t really have much control at the time because I had no idea I was dreaming so I just went along with everything. That’s just how dreams are sometimes. You don’t register what’s going on until after.

My bathroom was always at the end of the hall so I just set off and made my way to it. I finally reached my destination and stuck my hand out to grab the doorknob. The handle was surprisingly cold like it had been left outside during a winter storm. I pulled it open anyway and found myself face-to-face with nothing. Where my bathroom was supposed to be was now just an endless void. I stood there for a moment completely dumbfounded.

That’s when I woke up—relieved that what had just happened was a dream. This was where my dreams of doors that lead to nowhere began.

Around 6 months passed and I had long forgotten the dream. During that time I had more important things to focus on like recess, video games, and hanging out with my friends. A little dream had no place in my mind compared to my busy schedule. That’s until it happened again.

It started out just like the last. I woke up in the same spot I went to sleep and made my way out into the hall. I opened my bedroom door and was back in the same scene as before. What laid ahead this time was my overstretched hallway that now had about 10 extra doors attached. I repeated the same action as the last time and walked all the way to the end to reach for what I assumed was the bathroom doorknob and turned. I was greeted once more with that endless void.

I woke up. You know when you get that sense of falling and your whole body jerks back. That’s basically what happened. I remember sitting there for a minute reliving what had just transpired when I remembered that I had that same exact dream before. I didn’t really think much of it. Honestly, I thought it was cool at the time because that was the first time I had ever had a dream occur twice.

This continued for a few years. The dream had no specific pattern. Sometimes I would have them a few days apart, while other times it would be months before I had the dream again. There were only two things that always stayed the same. One was that the only door I could actually walk back into was my bedroom. The second thing was that the dream only ever took place in my family home. The environment always stayed the same. That was until one night at my friend Chris’s house.

My and Chris became friends in 6th grade. That year we were assigned seats next to each other and the rest is pretty much history. You know how it is, when you’re that young you will make friends with anyone. Well now we were both in 10th grade and it was the weekend and he invited me over to play a new game he just got. We were both really excited about it and spent the whole day and most of the night working through all the levels this game had. Next thing I know it’s 2 am and I was exhausted so I told him that I was ready to pass out. I was gonna be over most of the day tomorrow anyway so we could finish it then. I laid down on the makeshift bed we crafted out of blankets and pillows. Not long after laying down, I drifted off.

I came to on the custom mattress I was on and sat up for a second wiping the sleep out of my eyes. I looked around but noticed Chris wasn’t in the room so I got up to go see where he had gone. I went for the door, placing my hand on the doorknob and a chill made its way down my spine. I shrugged it off and pulled the door ajar. What was before me was similar but also different. It was the hallway outside of Chris’s room except now there were extra doors that weren't there before.

Something grabbed my attention. The door farthest from me had what looked to be a silhouette of a person leaning out from behind it. I could only see from about the torso up but I without a doubt knew that it was a person. I couldn’t tell you if it was Chris or not though.

“Chris, what are you still doing up? Couldn’t put the game down huh?” I called out.

There wasn’t a response. What I thought was Chris was still hanging halfway out the doorway and I could feel it staring dead at me. This unnerved me a little but I began making my way over to him anyway. That’s when it began waving at me. I stopped dead in my tracks. Taking in my surroundings a little better this time, the realization sank deep into my gut. I was dreaming. As if the person knew the realization I  just made it lowered its hand and went through the door slamming it with a force that echoed throughout the entirety of the place. I ran over to the door and swung it open. There was nothing there, just a dark spot devoid of everything.

I jolted awake, breathing as if I had just finished a marathon. It was still dark outside. I stood up and looked around, Chris was right there sleeping on his bed. I breathed a sigh of relief. This was the first time I had ever had the dream anywhere except my own home. It was also the first time that I had seen something besides the hallway and doors. I was left wondering who or what I had just laid my eyes upon. It’s safe to say I didn’t go back to sleep that night.

This was the first time I encountered it. That being is who I would later come to regret knowing as the Watcher.

After this incident, my dreams began to change. The static hallway and doors would now have little differences. The walls would be made out of different types of wood or wouldn’t be wood at all. The doors would be smooth or have intricate designs and the material they were composed of would change. Sometimes there would be paintings on the walls depicting strange alien environments. Worlds encompassed by darkness, strange plants and animals, upside-down rain with a sky that housed a purple sun and so much more that I couldn’t even begin to describe. There was one time when I even saw a painting of my own home except it was old and decrepit like no one had been there in ages. Different pieces of furniture would also show up. A small nightstand with a lamp, an armchair that looked as if from a different time in history, and occasionally even a full-sized couch that didn’t fit in with its surroundings at all.

Something else also began to change with the doors. I began to hear things from the other side. Sometimes I swear I could hear what sounded like muffled conversation. Other times there would be knocking or the sound of shuffling feet. There were also noises I couldn’t place. Deep rumblings or high screeches that definitely weren’t made by any animal or person that I knew. Occasionally I would be too frightened to open a door but no matter what door I opened I was always met by the same endless void. It was like I wasn’t permitted to see what was beyond.

This wasn’t what unsettled me the most though. I began to see that silhouette of a man more often. I never once got a full view it would always be just out of view. I would see it peeking out behind furniture or standing right on the cusp where the door connects with the hall. Sometimes he would wave at me and other times I would catch a blur going through into another door.

The dream had begun to happen more often at this point. It was occurring at least once a week if not more. My parents noticed a change in me as well. My grades started dropping in school because my mind was always occupied by the dream. It was honestly eating away at me and I had no idea why. I would try to shake it from my mind but it was always there no matter what I tried. They decided to send me to see someone but all they thought was that I had an overactive imagination. But after a few visits, the doctor decided to give me some medication that would help my sleep.

It has been three years since then. The medicine worked great and I never had the dream again. I’ve started college at this point and was having the time of my life. Me and Chris are now roommates sharing an apartment. It had been a while since I had even really thought about the dream and let it bother me. Sure it comes to mind every once in a while when I’m trying to go to sleep but it’s not holding me back anymore.

This was until last week when my medication ran out. My doctor thought that I had progressed enough to be taken off of it. I was a little worried at first, but I truly believed that I was past all of it. The first few nights were good with no dreams, just nice, peaceful sleep. Then the night that wasn’t peaceful came. I went to bed as usual, putting my phone on the charger and making sure I had an alarm set so I wouldn’t miss my 8 am class the next morning and with that, I was off to sleep.

I came to in my bed and believed that I had just woken up in the middle of the night. Even with this thought, something didn’t sit right with me so I got up to go grab a glass of water. I reached my hand out and pulled my door open and almost lost my composure. It was the hallway of my apartment except now there was only one door at the end of the hall. I knew that there should have been 3 doors. I could feel all of the color drain out of my face as a swallowed hard, it felt like my heart was going to jump out of my chest. I was back in the dream I use to have.

I knew the only way to wake up would be to open a door. Why was there only one door this time? I had never seen only one door. I knew what I needed to do but I couldn’t make myself move. I was frozen. I reached and slapped myself hard to snap myself out of it. I reminded myself that I was just dreaming nothing real can happen to me. With that, I somehow mustered the nerve to begin walking.

I swear the hallway seemed twice as long as it normally was. The length often changed some to acclimate to the number of doors, but this time it seemed to go on and on as I walked. Finally, I closed in on the door. With sweat beading on my face, I let out a heavy sigh and reached for the handle. I stopped just before a grabbed it as something caught my attention. I realized I could hear breathing coming from the other side. Deep raspy breaths that seemed to shake the door itself. *You have heard things like this before, just open the door so you can wake up,* I remember thinking to myself. That’s when I grabbed and tore the door open.

It was the same as always, a dark abyss. The only problem was that I hadn’t woken up yet. It never took this long.

“Wake up. Wake up. Wake up!” I yelled into the void.

That’s when I noticed it. The void now had an outline. It was so faint that it almost blended in perfectly. It was the silhouette of a person. It was whoever I had been seeing before I started taking the medication, and now they were right in front of me. I didn’t know what to do. I was just standing there wide-eyed, completely frozen in fear. Before I could even react an arm darker than I thought possible reached out and grabbed me.

I woke up with a sharp gasp drenched in sweat. Dawn was just breaking outside and it gave my bedroom a light glow. I lifted my arm up to see where whoever grabbed it and noticed that a gray handprint was now on my forearm. I was terrified. It was just a dream, there was no way it could actually affect me.

I got up and rushed to the bathroom. Seeing myself in the mirror was rough to look at. I looked as if I hadn’t slept in days and I was grossly sick. The handprint on my arm didn’t hurt, but nothing I tried would make it go away.

My next course of action was to call my doctor and tell him that I had to get back on my medicine because the dream started up again. At first, he was reluctant to agree, but after a little persuading that was more like begging on my end he relented and agreed. The only problem was that I wouldn’t be able to get my prescription filled until tomorrow.  I told him about the handprint on my arm as well and he scheduled me to go in and see him as soon as he could. It was going to be a few days because he was fully booked at the time. I was going to have to go through another night before then.

The whole day went by in a blur. The only thing on my mind was that person or at least what I thought was a person. The handprint hasn’t gotten worse so I guess that’s a good thing. I made up my mind that I wasn’t going to sleep and wait until the morning so I get my prescription. As night encroached I began to grow uneasy. I was going to do everything in my power to stay awake until I got my medicine. I put on a pot of coffee because I figured a little caffeine boost would help my situation.

Sometime around 1 am I had drank the last of the pot and decided to play some video games to pass the time. This worked for a few hours but I could fill my eyes getting heavy. I continued on to try to finish a level I had been stuck on for the past hour when my head started bobbing up and down threatening sleep. I picked up my phone to check the time and it was 4:14 am. The pharmacy opens at 10 so I still had a good ways to go. I decided to go splash some cold water on my face to wake me up a little. I stood up and made my way over to my bedroom door and pulled it open.

“No,” I said aloud as I now realized my fatal mistake. I knew immediately that this wasn’t the hall I was supposed to be seeing. When did I fall asleep?

*Hello*, it was as if something was speaking directly into my soul.

I spun around, and in horror I found myself face to face with the person I saw last night. I took a few steps back with my legs threatening to give out.

*It’s nice to finally speak to you, I’ve been trying for so long but you never seem to hear me. I am guessing by your reaction my voice finally reached you,* it said without moving a muscle.

It’s hard to describe what I was looking at. This “person” had no features except for an outline which was in the shape of a human. There were no features on him. The only factor that stood out was that it had nothing but a dark expanse that covered his body. He had no shadow either which really unnerved me.

I said the only thing that came to mind, “What are you?”

*Well you see,* he said while placing a hand on his chin, *I use to be a person like you, but now I just live here always exploring what this place has to offer.*

“What do you mean,” I said while looking at where I assumed his eyes would be, “What even is there to explore here.”

*That’s because your eyes aren’t fully suited for this place yet. Haven’t you been noticing more and more as you enter this space? This place is slowly transforms your body so you will be able to see all it has to offer.*

“What is has to offer? This place is nothing but a dream that I’ve had since I was little.”

*Do you still really believe that?*

“I know I’m asleep so what else could it be?”

*At the moment only part of you is here. When you become fully acclimated to this place your whole being itself will be here.*

“What do you mean? Are you saying I will be stuck in this place?” I say with fear mounting.

It was all too much to take in. My mind was racing. This being is talking about me getting stuck in this place for god knows how long. All I could think about was how to get out of this and wake myself up. I still clung on to hope that this was all a dream but that premise was slowly deteriorating.

*I’m tired,* it began, *I have been here for what feels like an eternity and you’re the first person who has been able to see me.*

“Look man, I am really sorry that you are stuck here but I don’t know how to help you.”

*You are helping me by just being here, the process has already begun.*

I looked down at the handprint on my arm.

*The next time you fell asleep I knew I would be free of this place and you would take over as the new watcher.*

“I can’t do this!” I shouted, “I have my own life out there and I didn’t agree to any of this! Find someone else!”

*But you will. You left your world for the last time when you fell asleep.*

I turned and in one motion began making a mad dash toward the door. As soon as I got to it I pulled with such force I thought it might rip off the hinges. Now I was free and I would wake up as soon as I opened it just like all the other times. The thing was, I didn’t.

*It’s too late. Your transition is too close to completion. You can’t leave anymore.*

“Please just let me leave, I can’t do this,” I begged.

*You should try to make the most of this. Beyond those doors are things you can’t even begin to imagine. You will see worlds people can only dream of. This will be your duty as the new watcher.*

I grabbed a stool that was to my left and his every ounce of force I had launched it at the being. It reached out its hand and the stool froze in place. Next thing I know the stool starts shaking and then explodes into thousands of tiny splinters.

The watcher began to make its way over to me. I stepped back for as long as I could until I was pressed against the wall. Tears were streaming down my face as I couldn’t accept my situation. I slid down the wall, my knees pressed into my face with my head down. I felt a hand press my head.

*You are almost fit to take my place. There is one final thing I must do.*

“Please don’t,” I said quietly as he grabbed my shoulder and pulled me to my feet.

*This last part is going to hurt,* it said and I looked at the being visibly trembling with fear trying to come up with anything to relieve me of this nightmare before me but I came up empty.

With that, he drove two of his fingers into my eyes. I will never forget the pain of feeling my eyes burst like balloons. What once helped me see began to pour down my face as I screamed and slumped to the floor.

*Thank you,* the watcher said and I heard a door shut in the hall.

I laid there for what felt like hours clutching my face. After some time I sat up still holding my face and tried to stand. I was feeling my way along the hall trying to find a doorway. That was when I hit something with my foot and began to fall. I reached both my hands out and placed them on an armchair. I could actually see the chair. I was relieved but then terror flooded my body. I screamed. My arms and hands now looked exactly like the being that left me here. I looked down at the rest of my body and realized it to was now that same pitch-black color.

“No, this can't be me,” I said aloud for no one to hear.

I looked around at my surroundings and something caught my eye. Some of the doors now had light spilling out through their cracks. I thought that by some miracle I would still wake up in my bed if I opened one so I made my way over. What I was met with on the other side of the door was not a void, it was a world full of desolate mountains and I saw 4 moons in its sky. I slammed the door shut and made my way over to a couch. I sat down completely dumbfounded at what I had just seen.

After a few minutes, I got up and decided to go back to my bedroom to try and find a way out there. Luckily my room was still attached and everything seemed to be working still. I tried to call my parents, the police, and whoever else I could think of but nothing ever connected. I truly was alone here and had no idea how to get out

Well, I think it’s been a few months since then. I only have a rough estimate because every clock I try to view is frozen. The electricity is still on in my room so I can charge my phone when it gets low. I can also look on the internet because that still works somehow. The only thing that keeps me sane is looking at old photos of friends and family. As time progresses it’s helping me less and less.

I now spend my days roaming around and going through different doors. The watcher before me wasn’t wrong, some of the worlds truly are amazing. I have even seen some that have humans. The only problem is that no one can see me. I have tried everything I can think of to get people's attention but no matter what I do no one acknowledges me.

I don’t know where the watcher before me went. I haven’t seen him anywhere and believe me I’ve been looking. I think my only hope of ever getting out of here is to make someone take my place. I just hope I can do that before this place takes sanity.

That brings me to today. I’ve been typing all of this out on my phone in hopes that someone will read it. If you can, just maybe, you will be able to see me also. If you have a dream of doors that go nowhere I will find you. It’s only a matter of time.

I hope to see you soon.

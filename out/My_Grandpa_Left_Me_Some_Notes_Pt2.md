I jolt up out of bed and check the time. Its 12:17(12:17pm). Nothing seems to be out of place. I slowly start to remember the events of last night. The figure, the notes, the texts-.

I hastily grab my phone to check for the messages. The messages are still there. So, what happened last night DID happen? I ponder on that thought for a while. I see the shoe box on the desk. I toss off the covers and open the shoe box. I grab the top pages. They are blank? How did that happen? I grab my phone off the bed and text the unknown number.

"Who are you?"

I put my phone down, not expecting this person to text me back. I grab the next two pages out of the shoebox. still the same as how I left them. 

I start to get the feeling that something is watching me. I swing around and see the closet. I slowly walk towards it and open the door. Nothing is inside. it's completely empty. I ignore the previous night and continue on with my day. Eating, washing up, doing chores. As I was doing those things some strange things happened. Seeing shadows, hearing whispers, things moving. Nothing I'm not used to. 

By the time I get back to my phone I have one new message from the strange number. 

"you know me."

I don't know any people. I have no friends, most of my family is dead. I purposefully changed my number so I could leave my past behind. I decide to read another page from the notes. Forgetting about what happened last night. I walk over to the shoebox and grab the next roll. This roll is two pages long, it reads:

"Have you ever thought about what lies under your bed? Some people believe in the, Boogie Man. Some people think that he's under your bed but that's a highly unlikely chance because there is only one of them. There are billions of children that he could scare. So why would he choose you?

So if he would not bother you, what else could want you? A monster, a ghost? Who knows. It may be a monster, they are real after all...

What are the chances of it being a human down there? You know, under the bed? You are more likely to be killed the day it crawls under the bed. Maybe they might play with you a little. Grab at the toes or ankles. Tug your sheets. Then kill you. 

They might pop out to eat your birthday cake at night. Maybe if they are nice clean your room and do the laundry.  But monsters, ghosts, people don't only live under children's beds. they live under every. Single. Persons. Bed. 

The moment you are born they go under the thing you sleep in the first time. It doesn't matter. bed, couch, crib. It doesn't matter. The moment you sleep for the first night, they crawl under. And at that moment you can't get rid of them.

They follow you. Even to your death bed. The moment you die, they steal your soul and you become one of them.

 The only way to stop the cycle is to stop sleeping and stay awake. Never let your kid sleep. only then will the cycle end. I hope you remember this.  Its too late for me-"

big blood stain.

"-eath bed as im writing this. Stay safe.

**DONT SLEEP "**

&#x200B;

This one as well just seems like a horror story. I had the same feeling I had when I read the last one. I close the box and lay down to sleep. It's around 19:00(7pm)

I wake up and the moon light shines through the window. I feel something applying pressure to my underside of the bed. I look to my left and see a small hand whip back under. I jolt up and look underneath the bed and see yellow eyes blink. I shine my phone under the bed and nothing is there. I shrug it off and go back to sleep. Just as I was falling asleep my phone goes off.

DING

"hello jensen"

DING

"you have awakened another one"

DING

"remember... You can only end what you started"

&#x200B;

I look at the closet remembering the events of the previous night. Its standing there again. with a new thing. 

That line still echos in my head.

*"you can only end what you started"*

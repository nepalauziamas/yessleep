I don't wish death on anyone, and certainly not my relatives, but occasionally I've entertained the daydream of inheriting a fortune.

This is unlikely to happen, because I'm not aware of anybody in my family that's rich.

My best friend, Rodney, thought the same thing, but as it turns out he had an unknown estranged great uncle that was absurdly wealthy. The cause of his death was unknown, as was the source of his money, but Rodney didn't seem to care. As the last living member of his family, everything was to be left to him.

There was ,however, one condition to his inheritance. It was peculiar but simple. Move into his belated great uncle's mansion on the outskirts of town, and live there for a year. If he did this, he'd be set for life, if not he wouldn't get a penny.

His move in date coincided with a two week business trip that sent me to the other side of the country. When I got back to town I went straight to see him.

He didn't answer his phone, so I figured I'd just drop by.

Raindrops began to patter on my windshield as I pulled up to the private drive. The gate was closed and I didn't know the code so my only option was to park my car by the entrance and slip past the wrought iron gates on foot. I pulled my jacket collar closer to my neck to shield against the slanting raindrops, and trudged into the mist.

Massive oak trees stood guard on both sides of the driveway. Even the forest here seemed to belong to a rich man. There were no underbrush, or scraggly pines, only ancient dominating hardwoods that cut off the sunlight from any small plants that tried to grow amongst them.

About a quarter of a mile down the driveway, the trees receded and gave way to a large clearing. In the middle of the clearing sat a behemoth. I looked up at the Victorian masterpiece that was now my friend's home. I felt small beneath it, like a child that was being scolded by an angry stranger.

Up ahead I could see that the front door was left wide open.

I hesitated when I reached the threshold. "Rodney? You in there?"

No answer.

I stepped into the foyer and cautiously walked down the main hallway. The interior was immaculate, and looked as if it were plucked straight out of the 18th century.

An orange glow danced across the walls up ahead as small crackles and pops shot through the air.

A fire was roaring in the biggest private library I'd ever seen. Books were stacked from floor to ceiling on all 4 walls. One leather chair faced the fireplace, a figure sat hunched over in it and stared into the flames.

"Rodney? Are you ok?" I asked

My words hit him like cold water as he snapped his bloodshot eyes in my direction. Where had he been?

"Look what the cat dragged in. I'm glad you’re here, honestly, the timing couldn't be better." He said

"Really? Why do you say that?"

Rodney sprang to his feet and drug up another chair to sit next to his. Its metal legs scratched the heart pine floors like nails on a chalkboard.

"Come sit next to me."

Something was off but I complied anyway.

He glanced over his shoulder before continuing, in a hushed tone.

"How is it that a being is contained?" he asked.

It wasn't strange to hear this kind of talk coming from Rodney. He'd always been drawn to abstract and conspiratorial ideas, but he was usually calm and collected. Today he reminded me of a scientist coming off a bender.

"A being is contained in a body." I answered

"Yes, and as people we're very good at identifying another person's body. But there might be other entities that are much bigger than us, not as contained as you and me but just as real."

"Why are we whispering?" I asked.

"It's the house, I think it's listening."

"You think the house is alive? Are you high?"

"On the contrary, I've never been more sober in my life. Just go with me for a second. After all they say it's the sign of an intelligent mind to be able to entertain an idea without accepting it."

He always said this when he was about to say something extra crazy.

"Ok, fair enough. Tell me what's going on"

"If a house wanted to communicate with you, how might it do so? It doesn’t have a mouth, it can't just come out and say, "Hello good sir", it would have to find other more subtle ways to interact with you. It might influence a dream, or emanate a certain atmosphere or feeling, it could even be as simple as a door that closes by itself at just the right time, signifying that you're on the right train of thought."

"Or the wrong one. Who says that a house would have altruistic intentions." I said

"Exactly, see this is why I need you here, you keep me grounded. If I'm going to make it through this year I'm going to need your help."

"What happened to make you think this place is haunted?"

At this, a glossed over look spread across his eyes.

"Nothing, just ignore me. I've been cooped up in here for two weeks, and it's rained every single day. This place is big enough to get lost in. Speaking of which, let me give you the tour."

Rodney seemed to revert, more or less, back into his usual self as he showed me from room to room. The house was a labyrinth, I'd need a map to remember all the hallways, wings and levels. The only reason anybody would ever build a house this big, is vanity.

"Would you mind staying here with me for a few weeks? Just while I'm getting used to the place. You could pick any room you want." He gestured to one of the many bedrooms that was nearly as big as my apartment.

"I'll be honest with you Rod, this place creeps me out."

"I know me too", he laughed, "but I'm asking you as a friend, and plus once I get that money I'll make it worth your while."

"I'll stay for a few weeks if you need me to, you don't have to pay me."

"Thanks man", he said as he clasped me on the shoulder

He showed me every room on the top two floors and the main level, but as we were working our way through the basement, there was one door that he skipped over. He didn't even acknowledge its existence.

"Wait a minute" I said as he carried on down the hallway, "what's in that room?".

"I think it's just storage or something, it was locked when I got here."

"I'm surprised you haven't bust the door down out of curiosity."

"I really haven't thought about it, there's only a thousand other rooms to keep me occupied", he said.

He kept moving so I followed after him to finish the tour.

That evening, after eating Chinese take out and watching TV, Rodney retired to the master sweet and I went to the first room that I could find on the second floor.

The moonlight shone in streaks across my bed as I laid staring at the ceiling. I left the blinds open intentionally. It always takes me a while to fall asleep and I didn't like the idea of laying there in complete darkness.

I expected to hear the creaks and groans that are typical of an older house, but they never came. If I would have left the blinds shut, it would have felt like I was floating in space, like some kind of antique sensory deprivation tank.

The morning dew on the grass was cool on my bare feet. I didn't know where I left my shoes at… come to think of it I didn't know how I got to the front lawn in the first place. The winter breeze hit the exposed skin of my chest, alarming me to the condition of my clothes. They hung off of me in tatters.

I looked up at the house and my eyes were drawn to the far window in the attic. A pale, stoic face stared down at me.

More faces appeared in adjacent windows. I scanned the whole 3rd floor, they were there too. My eyes flitted down to the second and then the main level. All of the windows held a white face, except for one.

My door closed and I sat up in bed, drenched in sweat.

Footsteps paced down the hallway.

Part of me wanted to crawl under the bed but that's childish, it was probably just Rodney. I decided to go check on him.

A dank draft met me in the hallway. The footsteps were now on the main level. I hustled down the stairs in a hasty pursuit but all was silent once I reached the bottom step.

I made my way to Rodney's room and slowly opened the door. He was curled up in bed with the slack jawed look of deep sleep on his face.

I couldn't be sure but I thought I heard a small metallic click come from the basement. It was the same sound that Rodney's door made when I carefully pulled it to.

I went back to my room, but I didn't go back to sleep.

Just as the sun finally peeked over the horizon, loud clanging noises started on the main floor. I unlocked my door and went to investigate.

"Good morning my old friend, I hope you're hungry," said Rodney with a toothy grin. He was flipping eggs in a cast iron skillet.

"I'll eat a little, I'm not a big breakfast person though. How'd you sleep?"

"Like a rock."

I knew he should be well rested but the dark circles under his eyes said otherwise.

"Did you hear anything last night?" I asked

"No, did you?"

"I heard footsteps in the halls. I thought maybe it was you but I checked and you were sound asleep. Also I think I heard a door close in the basement."

"It was probably just the house making noises, I've heard all kinds of things over the last 2 weeks that turned out to be nothing."

"What's in the locked room in the basement Rodney?"

He stared at me with that same crazy look he'd had in the library. The redness in his eyes seemed to smolder and burn just as the eggs were now doing.

"I told you, I don't know… Do you think I'm lying?"

"No I believe you, I just thought I heard someone go into that room last night, that's all."

He snapped his attention back to the burning eggs.

"You were probably just hearing things, you'll get used to it."

We ate our overcooked breakfast in silence as the sound of rain began to fall against the windows.

I thought about leaving for the day but the rain steadily increased and with it came the occasional burst of lightning. I wasn't going anywhere until this cleared up.

I went to the library and kindled a fire in the fireplace. After searching through piles of historical and philosophical books, I found something that was more in my lane, 1000 Leagues Under the Sea by Jules Verne.

I spent most of the day aboard the nautilus. Only taking small breaks for snacks and to stretch my legs. It was during the last one of these intermissions that I wandered over to a desk on the far side of the room. There was a journal and a pen sitting on top of it.

It might not be good manners but I opened it and flipped to the most recent entry.

&#x200B;

Time slips by, and I slip under

I will not lie, I cannot shun her

As thin as age

As blind as thunder

I fear I have become asunder

&#x200B;

It was Rodney's handwriting. I didn't know what to think.

The TV turned on in the living room. I closed the book and retreated to my room.

As I sat, barricaded behind a wall of pillows, the storm outside grew in intensity. Sheets of rain were hurled against the house and cracks of lightning threatened to knock pictures off the wall. I tried to ignore it and read my book, until the power went out. My phone was dead, so I just laid there, hoping to fall asleep soon. 

I'd made up my mind, Rodney meant a lot to me, but I was leaving this house first thing in the morning. Maybe I'd be able to convince him to come with me.

Powerful footsteps charged up the stairs like a bull. They were headed straight to my room and not slowing down.

The door burst open and Rodney went straight to the windows, throwing them open.

"What are you doing?" I yelled

"Do you feel it? The storms trying to bring her down" He vigorously patted the wall.

I didn't say anything. His usual level headed persona was now completely fractured.

"There's room for you too, trust me, don't you worry about that." He was now pacing back and forth in front of my bed. "You're not as contained as you think you are, my simple friend. Don't you want to be part of something much bigger than yourself. Far grander than you could ever be on your own."

A door slammed somewhere beneath us.

"Rodney, what's in the locked room in the basement?" I pleaded

"Isn't it obvious! My great uncle of course. That was the other part of his will. His coffin was to be left in the basement, he didn't want to leave the house, not ever."

Fearful disbelief washed over me.

I was temporarily frozen but I forced my legs to move and got out of bed. Footsteps were now slowly plodding up the stairs. I stuck my head out the door and that same dank draft wafted up to my nostrils.

A tall slender shadow danced its way onto the wall across from the stairs.

"We've got to go now Rodney."

"Go? Why would you want to go? Just give up already. No one ever leaves her."

I tried to drag him out of the room and down the hall to the next set of stairs but he wouldn't move and the struggle quickly shifted from me trying to drag him away to him trying to restrain me. He overpowered me and I tumbled backwards falling into the corner bedpost. It broke in half and we all collapsed on the floor.

The steps were now right outside my room.

"To hell with this" I said as I grabbed the bedpost and cracked Rodney upside the head. His eyes rolled back and he went limp.

I picked up the deadweight of his body and hoisted it out the window. He fell like a sack of potatoes into the bushes below.

I looked behind me to see cold and stiff fingers grasp the edge of the door frame and then I jumped out into the rain.

It took all of my strength to pick up Rodney and throw him over my shoulder. Slowly I made my way across the lawn and down the driveway.

Once I had put enough distance between us and the house I looked back to see a pale white face looking out of my bedroom window.

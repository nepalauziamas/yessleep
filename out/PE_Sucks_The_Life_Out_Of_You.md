Yo. My name's Jillian Parkinson, I'm fourteen, I'm in the eighth grade, and I have an insane story right here. And I really need advice on what to do here. I'm...*scared* is all I can say.

Things started some time ago, when our PE teacher, Coach Chase, went missing (I attend Blackthorne Middle School). Me and everyone else, we were really worried about her, and she's still missing even to this day. I have no idea where she went, but after this story happened to me, I have some suspicions.

Anyway, a week ago, we got our new teacher, Coach Millbell. Now, the first thing you should know about Millbell is that she was really young, I mean REALLY young, maybe about 20 or 21, and she was disturbingly pretty. I say disturbingly because she wasn't just pretty - she was *flawless.* It seemed as though there were no imperfections.

Her blonde hair looked like spun gold falling down her shoulders in perfect waves. She had natural blush and skin as smooth and pale as your stereotypical Barbie doll. Her eyes were a brilliant blue and seemed to stare right into yours with absolute power. Her eyelashes looked like long, beautiful brush strokes.

Barely any of us paid attention to the lesson at all. We ran laps, we did push-ups, blah blah blah, but basically all of us were distracted by Millbell's appearance.

After class, she asked Kevin Lane to stay. He must have thought he was the luckiest person alive, but I kinda hate teachers in general anyway. I was the only one who hadn't fallen instantly in love with Millbell. And I missed Coach Chase.

The next day, Kevin was exhausted in class. He fell asleep in PE, which thankfully was the day's last subject, and was pale, but not pretty-pale like Millbell. Tired-pale, with bags under his eyes and everything.

Afterwards, Mary Anne Enzanen was asked to stay behind after class. The next day, she too was pale, weak and tired. And this continued. Every day, Millbell would ask someone to stay behind after class. And the next day, that person would be exhausted, pale and tired.

I had no idea why we didn't notice a pattern. Maybe it was something she did to us.

And I never would have found out about the other thngs she did to us were it not for me accidentally leaving my phone at school.

I was halfway home when I realized it. So I went back to school and was about to open the gym door when I looked through the little window and saw it.

I was reminded of that scene from Hocus Pocus where all the witches are stealing the little girl's life force. Millbell seemed to be getting prettier. Her hair curled more, her waist grew smaller, and dare I say it her breast got bigger.

And meanwhile, Miranda Keynet, who she'd asked to stay behind today, was slumped with her eyes closed on a chair. Little streams of light running from her into Millbell and everything.

Millbell turned and saw me. She started walking towards the door, and it opened without anyone's influence. And it's a pull door from the inside.

 and I ran all the way home without my phone. I'm typing this on my laptop, I'm too scared to go back for my phone. I know a lot of people would deny it, but I also know what I saw.

Do I go back to school tomorrow? Do I tell someone? What do I tell them? "My PE teacher is stealing the life force from my classmates?" Yeah. Sure. People are soooo going to believe *that.*

Seriously, though...

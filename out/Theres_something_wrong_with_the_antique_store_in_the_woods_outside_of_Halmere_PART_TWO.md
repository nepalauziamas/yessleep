Today was my first day on the job, and things have proven weirder than I first thought. For one thing, my phone is on the fritz. I can’t make calls, I can’t send texts. The compass app is broken, and the maps app just does sideways figure eights around the South Pacific Ocean.

Nothing in my search brings up a result for ‘Halmere’ as a location. There’s plenty of results for some kind of fictional character, but that has more or less buried wherever the hell I am. And, while the lack of progress is frustrating, nothing is more annoying than spending an entire night searching every corner of the internet and then waking up to:

“Save with Geico! Save with Geico! Save with Geico!”

For those just joining me, Geico is a taxidermy crow; named after the only thing it can say. It was dumped at the store a little over a year ago by the executor of its owner’s will. The only words in said will were ‘Save with Geico’ over, and over, and over; in his own blood. Even weirder, Paul Denoche – the man in question – died of blood loss. As in, to this day, the only trace of his blood that’s been found is the small amount used to write his will.

That being said, Geico – again, the taxidermy crow – is loud and obnoxious in the mornings.

Jess immediately made it part of my job to feed it, and that had me nervous. What would an unblinking, feathery monstrosity like that even eat? Maybe flesh? Maybe souls? Maybe Maybelline?

Jess, half asleep, assured me that I’m an idiot and told me to get a bag of ‘Geico Snack’ from behind the front counter. Apparently, the feathery little bastard was particular with what it ate. And would only eat a home blend of walnuts, peanuts, cashews, and huckleberries.

She says it’s endearing, I say it’s a pain in the ass. But now it’s my job to keep a small pouch of the stuff on me at all times in case Geico gets peckish. Pun intended.

Anyway, Jess had me doing odd jobs around the store all day.

The first was to clean the upstairs rooms and get a mattress on my new bed. In case that surprises anyone, yes, part of the job is to live inside the antique store. Jess said something about security, and something about not being able to leave even if she wanted to, but I was in such a haze over how absurd things were getting that I only caught the gist of what she was saying.

The second job was to go inside the room under the stairs and polish the one thing that’s in there: a mirror. I’m applying the term, much like the polish, liberally. The job was to smear black boot polish over the mirror, so that nothing could be seen in it. I asked Jess why I had to do this to a perfectly fine looking mirror, and she dodged my question in the same we she always does, by changing the meaning of the question.

“Because I don’t want to,” she’d said.

After the third arbitrary task she gave me, replacing the candles upstairs, I started to get suspicious.

You see, I’d pieced something together. All the jobs Jess had me doing were jobs that kept me either off the first floor of the cabin, or out of view of anyone who might enter the store. At first it seemed like she was determined to keep me far away from the front counter, but as the jobs kept rolling in, I began to think it wasn’t the front counter she was keeping me away from.

The final straw was when, just as the day was almost over, she handed me a rake.

“What’s this for?” I asked.

She looked confused at my question, “Raking leaves?”

“So you want me to…?”

“Rake leaves?” she nodded.

I knew the answer, but I tested my luck just in case, “Outside?”

“Well,” she raised an eyebrow, “That is where leaves are found, Chris.”

And she was right about that. Leaves are found outside. But it wasn’t the leaves I was concerned about. It wasn’t even the spiders, grubs and bugs that’d be squirming around under all that dampness. It was leaving the antique store. I knew there was something wrong with the woods outside the store, and I was almost certain Jess knew what that something was.

Last night, as I quickly typed the previous post, I caught glimpses of them in the corner of my eye. Fast moving shapes at the edge of the clearing. At first, I thought I was seeing things. After all, I’d only just woken up from a pretty serious accident. But, as I turned my attention away from the bright glow of my phone screen, the more of them I began to notice.

I couldn’t see much. But they stood tall on two legs. And they moved weirdly, with a peculiar gait. It’s hard to explain, but they moved in ways not synced to their speed. I’d watch them take a step, but their position would slide as if they’d taken several.

Put simply, I was scared of the things in the woods. Don’t get me wrong, I’d seen some shit in the mine back home. But this was some twilight zone bullshit. And the last thing I wanted was to be out there, alone, raking leaves in it.

“But why do I have to do it?” I asked Jess.

“Because I don’t want to,” her response was typical.

“Ok, that’s fair enough…” I began.

But I paused. There wasn’t a better way of phrasing what I had to say. I’d only known her for a day, but that was enough to know that Jess was the kind of person who played things vague. And that’s not to say she didn’t have her reasons, but each reason carried the kind of weight no one wanted to carry.

“But,” I sighed, “Why… don’t you want to?”

Her brow furrowed, and her eyes were like rolling thunder. The look she gave me was a look I knew all too well, but I’d never been on the receiving end of it before.

The storm passed, almost as quickly as it came. And she smiled, in a way that was not reassuring.

“Wow Chris. Nothing gets past you, does it?

It didn’t feel like she was complimenting me.

She took a step forward; I raised the rake defensively. And she laughed.

“Fine,” she sighed, “It’s because I can’t.”

“That still doesn’t answer my-”

She made a shooing motion with her hand. But I wasn’t about to leave it at that.

“You didn’t answer-”

We locked eyes, and I knew this conversation was over.

Outside the antique store felt like any other forest of pine, I imagine. The air was cold and fresh. The grass was green, and springy. And the sun didn’t sear your skin the way it did back home. If anything, it was maybe a little too dark in the clearing. But I shrugged it off. I was here to rake leaves, not dwell on the fact that the sun didn’t dance on the treetops. And I did my best to ignore the nagging thought of where that dark shadow, distant and cold, stretched from.

The customers that trickled from the woods were nice enough. Almost all of them ignored me. A couple nodded in my direction. There was, at one point, this incredibly weird old woman. She was easily past eighty, and looked like any other sweet old lady; frail. But she was swinging around an axe like a lumberjack in his prime. She showed no interest in entering the store, and I wasn’t dumb enough to get any closer to her.

As time went on and I continued to rake the leaves, I couldn’t help but notice a pattern. The customers were entering the store with weird old junk and leaving with absolutely nothing. But, again, I shrugged it off. I was here to rake leaves, not dwell on the fact that the store’s collection of junk was growing larger and larger; beyond its capacity larger.

It was a little while after the customers stopped coming that I felt something was off. I had my guard up all day. I knew there were things out there in the woods. I’d seen them. And the moment the hairs on the back of my neck began to shiver I knew I had company.

It was standing around three meters away, past the line of white pebbles that circled the store. I’ve never actually seen a deer before, but this thing was what I imagine a deer would look like. It had a brown coat, and looked a little like a dog; but with longer legs, a lot more neck, and a lot less tail. Also, it had antlers. That’s mainly what helped me make up my mind.

The thing let out a series of wheezing snuffles as it sniffed for food among the trees. Its snout was covered in large, fleshy scars. And I could only imagine the trouble it was having with its nose.

“Hungry?” I asked it.

Its eyes shot open wide. Its head moved quickly as it scanned the clearing. As its gaze went back to normal and it started sniffing around the foliage again, it became pretty clear it couldn’t see me. The deer could barely smell, and it clearly couldn’t see. So I took pity on it.

“Now who’d do a thing like that to you, huh?”

Once again, its eyes shot open wide, and it looked around frantically.

“It’s ok. It’s ok,” I tried to assure it as I slipped some ‘Geico Snack’ from my pocket.

I knew very little about deer – again, literally my first time seeing one of these things – but I was pretty sure they didn’t eat meat. I poured the nuts and berries on a flat stone just before the white pebbles, and went back to raking leaves.

At this point, I remember feeling almost grateful to Jess. Maybe she hadn’t sent me out here for a task of great peril. In her own special way, maybe she’d shown me that the woods weren’t all that scary. There was now a certain calm to the woods I hadn’t felt since arriving.

The sun was sinking fast, and I was sick of raking. The deer still watched from beyond the pebbles, its head tilting in curiosity each time I dragged the rake. It hadn’t touched Geico’s bird feed. It was just watching, and listening.

Part of me was thankful a customer hadn’t come past in ages, partially because they’d end up scaring my new friend away, but mostly because I’d done a terrible job of raking those leaves. I had a big pile of leaves that rivalled one of the smaller mounds of junk from inside. And the moment Jess asked, I was fully prepared to blame all of the smaller patches I’d missed on the wind and the woods around me.

I was tidying up my pile when it happened. My rake stabbed down into something metal with a high *tink*. Curious, I sieved through the leaves to find a keyring with a single key and a tiny ID tag on it. It looked just like… my key. P-102 was indented into the metal tag. And the teeth of the key were worn down from that one time I had to cut myself free in Daria Wilson’s basement. It was, impossibly, the key to the delivery van I totalled. And if the key was here then…

I raked like a madman. Another step back. Rake. Another step back. Rake. Another step back-

My ass hit something warm and covered in fur.

Night was setting in, but the deer hadn’t left yet.

“Oops!” I jumped, “Sorry little-”

I couldn’t help but notice, hunched over the white pebble border and in mid-stroke, that there were only two deer hooves behind me.

I also couldn’t help but notice, dripping onto my shoulder and running down my right arm, a thick, warm paste of blood and saliva.

I only caught a glimpse of it as I flung the rake behind me and sprinted.

It was a deer. I was certain the damn thing was a deer. But that was when it crawled. That was when the dense foliage hid the hands at the end of its front legs. That was when its sockets weren’t too large for its eyes. And that was when the horrible scarring of its snout distracted from the way its mouth split vertically from its forehead to its neck, and I couldn’t see how huge and sharp the teeth in that sinewy split were. I was certain the damn thing was a deer, but that was how it hunted.

I don’t even know how I got away. I jumped back over the pebbles, sprinted across the grass, launched over all the stairs to the porch and slammed the door behind me. That wasn’t going to be enough though. I yanked at a table under a pile of junk next to the door and it avalanched; blocking us in, and that thing out.

“Dude! What are you doing?!” Jess yelled from behind the front counter.

“Get down!” I yelled as I ducked for cover.

Jess flicked the lights, dove over the counter, and joined me under the window.

Her voice was quiet, but no less serious, “Who was it?”

“What do you mean, who?” I hissed back.

“Was it Claire?”

“Who?”

“You didn’t take anything from her, did you?”

“What, no? Who the hell is Claire?”

“Well that answers that,” she frowned, “So what are you doing right now?”

“What am I doing?” I couldn’t believe her, but I wasn’t about to raise my voice, “There’s some kind of deer creature out there.”

Her frown deepened, “Some kind of deer creature? Really Chris?”

“I know it sounds stupid-” I began.

“It does,” she interrupted.

“But that’s what I saw.”

She nodded, and her frown lessened for a moment, “I wasn’t questioning if the deer creature was real, Chris. I was questioning why you trashed our doorway *because* of a deer creature.”

Was she hearing herself right now?

“It was a deer creature, Jess.”

“I know, I know,” she sighed, “But look outside for a second.”

I did as she asked. It was hard to see in the dark, night had rapidly descended. But I could  make out the shape of the deer, back on all fours. It was standing at the edge of the clearing, just past the border of white pebbles that circled the store.

This wasn’t making any sense.

“They can’t see anything past those stones.”

“What do you-”

“And they aren’t able to cross them either.”

“But that’s-”

“I told you before Chris. It’s the customers. They’re the only thing you have to worry about.”

She stood up, dusted herself off, and told me to clean my mess. I turned back to the window. The deer was gone. In its place stood a familiar face. Someone I used to know, sure, but someone I hoped I’d never see again. He stood there at the edge of the clearing, lit by nothing but the lantern he held in his hand.

He stared directly into my eyes, and ran a finger across his neck.

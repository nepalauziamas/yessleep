Hello, I understand that with a title like 'Do Not Read' it is only natural to be curious. It's normal to peek in, crack the door ajar to see what mystery lies behind it- but believe me when I say that some doors are best left shut, that's why they make locks. If you know what is best for yourself, you will stop reading here. But of course, you won't trust me, after all, I am the one who wrote that title, I'm the one who doesn't want you to read this so why listen to me? I'll tell you. If you keep reading this, I'm very afraid you won't stop, and there's little I can do to change that. So please, do what I ask, and stop now.

Still here? I suppose that's only to be expected, it's human nature not to follow directions. Take me for example, I guess I was quite like you in that way- rebellious and free-spirited. No one told me what to do and I never listened to anybody, my life was mine to make and nothing was going to hold me down. Another way that I reckon I'm like you, dear reader, is that I liked to read. I consumed books like they were food, shoving down serving after serving and desperately searching for something new and exciting to thrill my palate. And on one particular day, I found something that was quite scrumptious looking.

In a little shop, stuck in the corner of a busy town and hiding in the shadows, I found a library full of dusty books. I was enthralled and I immediately went about buying each and every interesting novel or series I could get my hands on. There's something about old books that really entice me. It's like smelling the popcorn at the theater, their aroma just begs me to buy them. As I filled my arms with countless volumes of pages, I noticed something sticking out between all the rest of the options. It was a short little thing, barely enough pages to be stuffed between a cover, with the title: Please, Do Not Read.

I dropped everything, my curiosity taking control of me. I had to know what was in it, what hidden knowledge was contained between its pages. So, I didn't listen. I bought the book and left that little shop, and when I got home I immediately started to read. The book kept begging me over and over to not read it, I found it rather annoying. If they didn't want me to read it, why would they have written it?

Maybe because it was embarrassing? Had I found someone's journal? No, the person writing seemed to be directly talking to me like I was there in the room with them. It was a little uncomfortable, it was like they knew I wouldn't listen to their directions. But of course, they couldn't do anything to me, it was only a couple of pages I found crammed between some other stories. So, I kept reading on and on, despite having been warned.

It was about a man who had discovered something incredible. A series of words, a string of letters and figures that could possess great power. They say that if you read these words in the right order, beginning to end, you would be forever trapped between the pages. Despite his better interests, the man kept reading and hasn't been found since. It was quite intriguing stuff, but of course, all of that was nonsense.

You're still here, aren't you? You are still reading; you want to see the end don't you? But believe me, you don't. I was like you, in the same way I'm like the man in the story I found. I kept reading, I wanted it all. I just couldn't stop myself! There was no point in seeing the end, there was no point in reading the last few words, but I did, even after I read the warnings. I could've just looked away but instead, I find myself here- with you. 

I'm stuck here, dear reader, I'm stuck, and I can't get out. I'm here among the pages, I am here in the spaces between each and every letter and I see you. I watch you read this even now, and you're still doing it even though I told you not to. I guess we are the same, I suppose we just won't listen to anyone or anything. But unlike me you still have a chance, you can go! Go now! Don't read the final words, just let them rot at the bottom of the page! Please, even if you don't believe me just do it, save yourself!




But of course, people like us never listen to anybody, do we?

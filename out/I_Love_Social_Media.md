I've been watching the internet since it's birth. The growth of sharing information with random strangers was so delightfully new and intriguing. First it started with chat rooms, forums and other chatting zones. As a teen I spoke with people all over the world. It was exciting and different. That was the first time I spoke privately with a complete stranger. 


I assumed they were being honest with me about who they were. I was being myself, a 17yo dude who played drums in band and who was looking forward to getting out of school and out of this small lame ass town. She was a 15yo pretty goth girl with dyed black hair and a lip ring. It really turned me on, knowing she wasn't anything like the boring girls in my area who only want to go out for pizza and plan to get married and have babies and never leave this stupid town. I had no interest in staying here or getting married. Kids? Hell no. 


So after a few weeks of chatting she suggested we meet up at her place when her parents weren't home. She lived about an hour away, but I could "borrow" my dad's car and he wouldn't even know. He was literally a car salesman and had two working cars and a few not working ones, so grabbing one for a few hours while he was off drinking or whoring wouldn't really be an issue. I grabbed the car and followed the MapQuest directions to the house she told me she was living in and I just couldn't hide my excitement. The whole drive all I could think about was her cute lip ring and how I couldn't wait to feel it on my junk. 


I had a few problems finding the place as it was kinda in the boondocks in her town, but after some cussing, backtracking and stopping for a map at a gas station I finally pulled up to a decrepit looking house with tall grass and a dirt driveway. I pulled up and got a slightly bad feeling, she didn't say she lived in such a run down house or anything, but while my brain was trying to put on the brakes my cock wasn't listening and I jumped out of the car and rushed up the steps before I could even stop to think. Big mistake. 


She told me she would leave the door unlocked, so I knocked and came on in. I shut the door behind me and was shocked by the darkness of the living room. The curtains were drawn and the only light I could see was in a room down the hallway. I called out but didn't hear anything. That was the first time my brain overrode my sex drive, but it was then I felt a powerful blow to my head. I barely knew what was happening or why the old threadbare rug was rushing up to meet me. 


I woke up tied to a radiator and laying on a grimy old mattress. My wrists were tied together with a thick rope but my feet were free. I saw my captor then, a large semi bald dude in a white dirty wife beater and boxers that looked like they hadn't been changed in years. Immediately I realized I had fucked up big. Nobody knew where I was. I was trapped with this disgusting man who obviously had plans to do fucked up shit I had no interest in. At first I tried pleading with him to let me go, we could work something out. He just laughed and took off his boxers to show the most deformed looking dick I'd ever seen. This wasn't going well. 


I was about to be raped by this giant fucker, but my legs were free and what this dude didn't know was I used to be on the track team, so my legs were strong as shit. I acted like I was scared (I was) and pushed myself against the wall like a cornered rabbit, pulling my legs close to my body. When he got on the mattress and started crawling towards me I waited until he got in touching range and kicked out as hard as I could with both feet. The shit eating grin on his face disappeared when my left foot shattered his nose, while my right foot slammed into his mouth and kicked out two teeth. He jumped back in a strangled cry of pain and fury while I furiously moved my hands until I loosened the rope. Before he could get his bearings I was untied and standing over him. 


I thought about just kicking him until he couldn't get up and getting the hell out of there but I was SO PISSED. I started kicking him, but couldn't stop. I kicked and kicked and stomped. I was in a blind rage and couldn't stop myself even if I had time to think. By the time I came to my senses I realized this dude was dead as hell. He was less a person and more just...a wet bloody pile of mush. I started to panic, but then I went cold. Nobody knew I was here. Obviously nobody knew HE was here doing what he was doing. I thought back to the movies I'd seen about fingerprints and such, and decided to wipe down everything I had touched. My shoes and socks were a grisly mess so they needed to go. I searched the house with my hands wrapped in my shirt and found some trash bags. I covered both feet in bags and got the hell out of there. 


On the way home I stopped and wrapped my shoes and socks in my pants with large heavy rocks tied up in the pant legs, then tossed it in the river outside my town. I washed my hands and made sure there wasn't any blood on me anywhere else. Driving home in my underwear shoeless was strange but I was grateful it was dark outside and nobody saw me. I stripped down and got in the shower and I'm not too ashamed to admit I cried so hard I threw up. The idea that I could have been raped by that monster and murdered was too much for my little brain and I just shut down. After scalding my skin with the hot water I climbed out of the shower and laid in my bed. I wanted to cry but I was just...empty. 


That night I didn't really sleep, but I also didn't feel like I did anything wrong. Yes, I kicked and beat a man to death, but he had it coming. Who knows how many other people he had tricked. I felt like I should feel sick at the idea of what I had done, but I didn't feel anything but righteous anger. He deserved it. He lied to me and was going to hurt me. He was a big gross man who didn't deserve to live. The more I thought about it the more I felt like I had done the right thing. I thought of how he lied to me. How he pretended to be that girl and convinced me to come to him. It must have been so easy for him to lie to me, a dumb teenager who only thought about getting laid. 


The next morning I decided to skip school and remove every scrap of contact between myself and that lying sack of shit. I couldn't get the image of him crawling towards me with that disgusting grin on his face out of my mind. The internet became something dark and scary. People can lie and you'd never know until it's too late. I went back in the forums and chats with a different perspective. I deleted all my personal information and took down all my pictures. I didn't want anybody to know who I was, didn't want anyone targeting me again. That feeling, that I was hunted like a buck, lured out by my sex drive was horrifying to me. 


A few days later I started chatting again, but I never shared private information. Never told anybody who I was, how old I was, where I lived, or anything. But other people weren't as reserved. Women in particular couldn't seem to help themselves. Sharing pictures, telling people how old they were, where they lived, even sharing racy pictures of their cleavage and short skirts. I couldn't help but look and think "I could get these girls to meet me and they wouldn't have any idea who I even am". At first the idea made me uncomfortable. I would be as bad as that lying creature who had tricked me. I kept thinking back to that grin of his, how certain he was that I was a scared helpless boy that he could do with as he pleased. I could lie to myself all I wanted but my hard-on told the true story. 


Nowadays people share so much online it's beyond easy. I don't even have to contact them. I watch their TikTok videos, read and watch their Instagram accounts, and get so much information. If they have a boyfriend, pets, if they live alone, etc. it's all there in videos and pictures. I can find out everything I need to know about a woman without ever having to make myself known. IP addresses can be hidden in case investigators ever put two and two together, but I've never even had a scare. I have a demur quiet wife who knows to do as she's told. She's a great cover. Nobody expects a family guy who coaches little league to be a serial killer. 


After the first time it gets easier. I made a few mistakes here and there but for the most part I've gotten really smart. I have a house in the middle of nowhere. Nobody knows I own it since it stayed in the family's name and the last of the family mysteriously disappeared ('she" still collects and deposits her social security and pays her bills from that account). Taking girls there after I abduct them is easy and I don't even have to kill them immediately. Sometimes I stay with them for a week or so, telling my wife and friends I'm on a business trip. I particularly love getting the women who obsess over true crime. They always think they are smarter than criminals, and they could be right, but I assure you, you aren't smarter than me. 


Skinning a person takes time, effort, and skill. Especially if you want to keep them alive while you do it. So many veins and arteries you have to cauterize as you go. The first thing I do is cut out their tongue and burn their vocal cords. Their screaming gets so annoying I can't focus on what I'm doing, so taking care of that is of the utmost importance. I really love how soft and luxurious tanned human skin is. Targeting pretty girls with extensive skin care routines really improves the quality of the leather. I've made and sold so many coats and chairs for ridiculously high prices, the demand is always there for high caliber leather and nobody really asks where it comes from. Rich people don't care, and I always make sure to bleach out any distinguishing characteristics.


So ladies, thank you for your videos, pictures and information that make my job so much easier. Thank you for sharing so much of your life online for everyone to see. Thank you for your honesty and openness. Thank you for giving so many minute details of your lives to the world. Please, don't stop! Social media is such an amazing thing, and I have grown to love it beyond measure. After all, I wouldn't be the man I am today without it.

I only went to Mexico to get away from it all. I’d just been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer and had maybe six months to live if I was lucky. This prompted me to sell my house, my car, hell… I even sold my dogs.. All so I could come out to Mexico and party as much as my twenty-nine year old body could handle. I didn’t have any family left. I had maybe two close friends. Neither of which knew I had left town. 

I sat at a dive bar staring at the empty shot glass in front of me. My mind was semi swirling. So far the party hadn’t been a party really. More just me moping around. I’d wanted to go to the beach but…. My body was just too tired to do anything. Except for drink that is. 

I was maybe two shots deep so I hadn’t felt anything yet. I was just about the only person in the bar aside from the bartender. Who was a stout older gentleman named Juan. He was friendly enough. We’d made small talk for a good hour or so. He’d recognized me from the previous night. I guess I looked sick. Because he’d been able to figure it out within a few minutes of meeting me. He stood opposite me wiping down the bar on his side while I stared at my shot glass. 

“You want another?” He asked.

I just sighed and nodded. My mind cursing my situation. He exhaled and poured me another shot of whiskey. It was around that time that the door opened. A tall man entered. When I say tall, I mean he stood so tall that he had to duck down to get through the doorway. I didn’t wanna stare… But the man was taller then any man I’d ever seen in person before. He eyed me as he went and sat in a corner table. 

“I’ll be with you shortly sir.” Juan said. 

I went back to staring at my shot glass. Then my eyes shot up to the tv which was playing some kind of sports channel. I don’t speak Spanish, so I’m not sure what was playing. It made me think about the super bowl though… How I wouldn’t even get to see who won the next one. 

I sat there pouting for a few hours as guests came and went. By sunset, the bar was packed. The sounds of merriment and drunken fun rattled off behind me. I hadn’t taken another drink yet. I’d been lost in thought for two hours. That was when someone pulled the stool next to me out and sat down. I didn’t look at him. Not at first. 

“Cancer eh? That’s a bummer.” he said. 

I felt my heart skip a beat as I turned to him. The man who sat next to me had shirt dark hair and a thin black mustache. He had a smug look in his eyes that seemed to almost glow a bright shade of hazel. 

“How did you know?” I asked. 

The man shrugged, “Mr. Deckland? Right?” 

“Actually it’s Deckard..” I replied. 

“Ehh.. Close enough.. Tell me something Mr. Deckland..”

“Deckard.” I corrected.

“Yeah.. Whatever.. You sold your house, your car, and even your fucking dog, just for what? To come out here and party it up till you die?” He asked. 

I looked at him for a second. My mind was screaming with alarm bells for me to get out of there. How did this man know who I was? 

“Who are you?” I asked.

“The names Adrian Stein.. You can call me Adrian.”

“What do you want with me?” I asked

“I just wanna talk. You see.. You’re out here to live it up. But I’m not seeing a lot of living. In fact, I’ve only seen you mope for the last few days. It’s a bit pitiful… Don’t ya think?“ he asked in response as he raised his hand. 

Juan poured him a shot and then me. I grumbled under my breath as I remembered why exactly I was there. 

“Yeah well… A death sentence is hard to keep off of one’s mind.” I said as I lifted the glass to my lips. 

Adrian nodded. “Well I’d imagine so. Tell me something, are you religious?” he asked. 

I scoffed as I put the shot glass back down. I hadn’t taken it yet. For a second I thought I knew why he was there. 

“If you’re trying to get me to join some kinda cult… It won’t work.” I said. 

Adrian laughed. 

“Oh no Mr. Deckland.. I’m just curious as to your beliefs about the afterlife since you are… Ya know… On the clock.” 

I rolled my eyes as I turned back to the bar. This time I dumped the shot down my throat. The whiskey burned as it went down. I could still feel Stein’s eyes on me. I could still see that smile of his. 

“Okay.. I apologize Mr. Deckard… I don’t mean to offend. I’m just curious.” 

He actually used my real name there. I took a deep breath as I turned back to him. 

“I don’t know.. I grew up Catholic.. But-“ I started. 

“But what? You lost faith?” Stein asked. 

“Nah.. I just grew up.” 

“But you have to think about it from time to time.. Especially now.” He said.

I sighed.. I did think about the idea of an afterlife. I honestly didn’t consider myself a bad person. I mean I’d done bad things before.. Lied.. Cheated… Nothing no one else wasn’t really guilty of. 

“I don’t know man.. Heaven and hell have always been…. I don’t know.. I hope there’s an afterlife. But I’m not sure I really believe there is one. Don’t get me wrong, I know most people in my position are typically inclined to believe it to make themselves feel better but I… I just don’t know..” I took a deep breath as my mind wondered. “I don’t wanna die. And the thought of doing so scares the shit outta me.”  

Adrian sighed as he turned around on his bar stool. He dumped his shot down his throat. He smirked as he put the glass down. The entire bar crowd behind us was all going about their business. Some were laughing. Some where silently drinking. The tall man in the corner just watched us. 

“Look at them.” He mumbled. 

I looked over my shoulder at the crowd. Most seemed in a joyous mood. Most were vacationers. We were maybe two miles from the resort I’d been staying at. 

“Look at who?” I asked. 

“Them.. The people.. The humans.. All so oblivious.. Most here are living their lives happily on the surface. They take living for granted. Tell me something Mr. Deckard.. Do you think if they knew they were about to die, that they’d be here? That they’d be reveling? Or would they be wallowing in their sorrows like you are?” 


“Don’t know. Don’t care.” I said. 

“Ah but you should Mr. Deckard..” 

“And why’s that?” I asked. 

“Because their lives are in your hands.” Stein said. 

I turned and squinted at him. 

“What?” I asked. 

“You see that man in the corner? The big Asian guy?” Adrian asked.

I looked at the mountain of a man who had entered the bar before. He smirked at us.

“You said you grew out of religion. What if I told you that that man was a Japanese thunder god called Raiden?” Stein asked.

I let out a soft chuckle. But Stein just gave me a serious glance. 

“Raiden?” I asked. 

“Or Raijun… He prefers Raiden though.” 

“I thought you said you weren’t gonna try and get me to join a cult?” I asked. 

Stein turned his head to me with a serious look in his face.
“I’m not… Mr. Deckard… There are twenty-one people in this bar, and every single one of their lives is in your hands.” 

“What?” I asked. 

“Mr. Deckard, I’m not going to repeat myself a third time. Now.. I need your help, are you ready to hear your options?” 

I honestly thought the guy was playing a prank on me. I grumbled as I stood up. 

“Good night Adrian!” I said sternly as I started to walk away.

His hand landed on my shoulder. Then with an unexpected strength I forced me back into my chair. 

“I’m afraid I can’t let you leave. I’m rather pressed for time. Now… We’re gonna play a game.”

“You can’t be serious.” I growled as I tried to remove his hand.

Stein was strong. Very strong. I found myself unable to move at all. 

“I am serious. Deathly serious. Now look at the door. In three seconds, a man is going to walk in here with a guitar case. You’re gonna guess what’s inside of it. If you get it right. I’ll spare ummm… That guy.” Stein said as he pointed at a random man who was drunk off of his ass in the corner. 

“I’m not playing your stupid game!” I growled as I tried to shove Stein off of me. I might as well have shoved a wall though. He didn’t budge. 

“For a cancer patient. That was impressive.” Adrian said with a smirk. 

The door opened, a Hispanic man with a black guitar case walked into the bar. He calmly walked up to the table where Raiden was sitting and watching us and set the guitar case down in front of him. The guitar man then turned and walked to the bar door and stopped next to it. He leaned back on the doorframe and looked at me. 

“Now.. Mr. Deckard.. What’s in the case?” Adrian asked. 

“Fuck you!” I spat. 
 
Adrian chuckled. 
“Maybe later. Now answer the question.” 

“I don’t know.. A guitar.” I said. 

“Oof.. Close but wrong..” 

Raiden stood up from his chair and opened the guitar case. Where he pulled a large wooden club that I now know was a kannabo from the case. The giant casually threw it over his shoulder as he walked straight up to the drunken man. He looked at Stein. Who only nodded. Raiden very quickly raised the club and brought it down hard on the man’s head, which violently exploded into bits of brain and skull. The wall and floor behind him were painted in mushy crimson bits. 

Everyone in the room either screamed or shot out of their chair. I could see Juan dive down behind the bar in the corner of my eye. Several people started to try and exit the bar. But as they did so the guitar man stepped in front of them. A pistol in hand. 

“Ah-Ah-Ah! No one leaves!” Adrian announced. 

People shouted and clamored. Most of them drunk. All knew not to try and cross the man with the gun. I even saw some one trying to dial for help on their phone. Some tried to run out through the hallway that led to the back. Only for a tall blonde woman with a bow and arrow to step out in front of them. 

“H-he just killed that guy.” I stammered out. 

“Yeah. But don’t worry about him. Worry about you.” Stein said as he threw his arm around me. 

“Alright… Everyone calm down! As you’ve probably noticed. We’ve jammed your signals. No calls out until after I find what I’m looking for.” Adrian said. 

“What?” Asked one of the female patrons. 

“What does any of this have to do with me?” I asked.  

“Well it’s quite simple really.. You say you’re afraid to die. Well I have the means to give you the ability to live. To survive you’re ordeal. But you have to make a choice.” 


“And what kind of choice is that?” I asked. 

“One of the patrons in this bar is a shapeshifter who stole something from me. Something I need. Now.. Before we get to your choice.. You’re gonna help me retrieve it.” 

The mixture of alcohol, fear, confusion, and disbelief made me nauseous. I was mere moments from puking my guts up. 

“How the hell am I supposed to help you identify a shapeshifter?” I asked. 

“Shapeshifter’s are a strange bunch.. This one in particular is part of a group of thieves that call themselves the Loxley gang. The thing about shapeshifters though… Is that they can’t  get stuff like cancer.. Which….” He took a long sniff of me. I could feel a chill run down my spine.  “Is how I know that it’s not you.” 

My eyes started instinctively scanning the patrons. I had no idea what I was looking for. Or how I was even supposed to start looking. 

“I still don’t..” I started.

“He would have probably approached you recently. He may have been able to sniff out your condition. He may have seemed sympathetic.. But I can assure you. His intentions are less then pure.” 

I thought for a second. The only one who’d really figured out that I was sick was…. 
“Juan.” I mumbled. 

That was when I heard the click of a firearm. I could hear Stein’s jaw pop as he smiled and turned around with his arm still around me. 

“There you are!” Adrian said. 

“Let him go!” Juan growled. 

“I don’t want too.” Stein replied eagerly. 

My heart was thumping in my chest like a battle drum. Juan seemed to steady his shotgun. 

“I’ll blow your fucking head off!” He growled. 

“Where’s the Sample?” Stein asked.

“Im not telling you.” 

I could hear Raiden’s thunderous footsteps approaching from behind me. 

“Victor’s not gonna like that answer. Do you even know what Agent Loxley had you steal?” Stein said. 

“Fuck Victor! And fuck you! You’re not worthy of that kind of power.” 

“How do you know what makes one worthy? You yourself we’re gonna kill this one and steal his identity. Weren’t you.. Maximón?” Stein said. 

At that point Raiden was next to us. Juan turned the shotgun on him and fired. The blast made my ears ring. I didn’t see the bullet hit Raiden. If it did then he didn’t react to it. He only raised his free hand. A bright blue bolt of lightning hit the bartender square in his chest, sending him flying back into a rack of whiskey. 

I stood there frozen. Raiden approached the counter and stepped over it. Stein turned me around. I could hear blows landing behind us. 

“Well.. That was easy.” Stein said. 

“What just happened?” I asked. 

“Maximón is a Mayan trickster deity.. Kind of like Hector over there!” Stein said as he motioned to the man standing at the door with a pistol in his hand. 

“Oh and that’s Artemis!” He said motioning towards the lady with the bow and arrow. 

I didn’t understand and my face showed it. Stein just waved his hand to the side. 

“Mr. Stapleton.. Would you please escort Mr. Deckard outside. I would hate for him to bear witness to what comes next.” Stein said as he pressed his finger to his ear, almost like he was wearing an earpiece.

“W-what happens next?” I stammered. 

“We’re gonna torture the hell out of this bartender.” Stein said calmly before putting his finger to his ear. 

“Mr. Stapleton? George?” He asked as his eyes shot up to Artemis. 

“Go make sure the perimeter is still up.” He commanded. 

Artemis did as she was told. She walked past the terrified, weeping crowd and out the front. That was when the sound of gunfire erupted from outside. I watched Hector take cover by the doorway. Stein shoved me to the floor. Raiden tossed Juan over the bar and he hit the floor next to me with a wet plop. His face was bloodied and bruised, he was also missing a few of his teeth. I looked up towards the back door as Artemis retreated inside while firing several arrows. She took cover around the doorway next to Hector. 

“Now who might that be?” Stein asked an a unusually casual tone. 

“It’s the fucking Loxley Gang!” Artemis said. 

Stein let out an annoyed groan. 

“Where’s Stapleton?” he asked.

Artemis smirked at him. As if on que a body came flying through the front window. A man in a black metal suit stepped up into it. I could hear gunfire dinging off of him. The suit wasn’t bulky, it fit his frame well. Most of the armor looked plated with a black body suit underneath. The circular googles on his eyes seemed to glow a crimson color. He had a pistol on his hip and a black metallic scythe looking thing on his back. 

“There you are!” Stein laughed. 

“Sorry the perimeter broke boss! Seems Agent Loxley’s been busy.” 

“Did they bring the boss?” Stein asked through an intrigued glance. 

Stapleton shrugged as he gestured towards the body on the ground. The same one he’d thrown through the window. 

“Ask him.” Stapleton said. 

Stein walked over to the man on the floor and grabbed him by his neck. I hadn’t expected Stein to be so strong. He lifted the man up to his feet almost effortlessly. 

“Wake up.” He said as he tapped him on the forehead. 

The unconscious man gasped as he was awoken. Then almost immediately started groaning in pain. Stein looked down at the man’s legs where he noticed a piece of bone was sticking out of his pants in the thigh area. I could see a wet spot of what I assumed was blood running down the man’s leg.

“Eesh. That looks pretty bad man.” He turned to Stapleton. “Did you do that?” 

“He tried to run away.” 

A sudden cascade of gunfire range out. Stapleton’s suit was hit several more times. I could see past the man as a man in black tactical gear approached him whilst unloading an assault rifle. Stapleton pulled his pistol and fired it without looking. He hit the man dead center in the forehead. I couldn’t help but curl into a ball. But I also couldn’t take my eyes off of Stein. 

“How many of you are there?” Stein asked the man. 

The man squirmed against Stein’s grip. But Stein only lifted him off of his feet.

“Where are your bosses? Where’s Loxley? Where’s Cain?”

The man only squirmed some more. Stein rolled his eyes as he turned and looked at me. 

“He’s useless. Isn’t he?” He said right before he snapped the man’s neck. 

The bar patrons all screamed or gasped. I noticed a woman praying in the corner. She had a small silver crucifix that she was clutching in a death grip.

“Oh calm down people.” Stein said sternly. “Gonna give me a migraine!” That was when his head seemingly snapped to where the praying woman was. He smiled at her. 

“Raiden.. Bring that one here.” 

Raiden thundered over and grabbed the woman by the back of her neck. 

“Mr. Stein, do we really have time for this?” Asked Stapleton. 

“Shhhh Daddy’s teaching.” 

Raiden dropped the girl at Stein’s feet. The man squatted down to level with her. 

“Which denomination are you? Catholic? Baptist? Morman?” Stein asked. 

The woman didn’t look him in the eyes. She just continued praying. 

“You wanna know how much that book of yours got right?” 

The woman stopped praying for a second and looked up at him. That was when I noticed that his eyes had turned completely black.

“There she is. Tell me, what’s your name?” he asked as he sniffed the air. 

“P-Paige..” she stammered. 

“So Paige, what do you think praying is going to accomplish here?” Stein asked. 

“I-I don’t know. I just d-don’t wanna die!” 

Stein nodded as he looked up at me. 

“You humans… You all wanna go to heaven but you don’t wanna die. Seems a little contradictory.. Don’t ya think?” 

“Stein. I don’t think we have time for this.”
Stapleton argued. 

“You don’t give the orders! I do!” Stein boomed as he glared at Stapleton. Then he looked back down at the woman. 

“Where where we? Oh… You don’t wanna die.. What would you do in order to survive?” 

“A-anything! I’d do anything!” She whimpered. 

“Would you sell your soul?” He asked. 

“What?” Questioned the woman. 

“Would you….. Sell me your soul?” He asked. 

“A-are you the devil?” She asked in response. 

Stein cocked his head to the side. 
“No. I’ve met the devil though. He’s kind of depressing.” 

The woman’s face contorted in confusion. 

“Well Tick-tock Paige! Im waiting!” 

The woman stammered a bit. 

“Come on Paige! You said you’d do anything!”

“But it’s my soul?” She gasped. 

“It is your soul. I can kill you right now and maybe you’ll go to heaven. Maybe you’ll end up in Gehenna anyway and all of that prayer will have been for nothing. Be honest.. You don’t really know if your going to heaven or not .. Do you Paige? You reek of guilt and regret!” Stein looked around the room. 

“Which of these men are your husband?” He asked.

“N-none of them. My husband is at the resort.” She whimpered. 

“Then which one are you sleeping with?” 

“I’m not..” Paige started. 

“Paige.. Honey… I can smell your perfume on at least three…” he sniffed the air again. “No wait four of the men in here. You know, adultery is a sin right? So pray as hard as you can! Please! If you’re so desperate to speak with god… Raiden.” He said as he motioned to her.

More gunfire erupted from the street. Stapleton returned fire. Artemis shot a few arrows from around the doorway. The rest of the crowd seemed shrink down in cowardice even more so. 


Raiden stomped over to the woman with his club raised. 

“No! Wait! I’ll do it!” She pleaded. 

Raiden hesitated, then looked at Stein. Who only smiled at her. 

“Silly girl! I don’t need to buy your soul!” He said as he motioned for Raiden to continue. 

It was over quick. Raiden bashed her head in with a single strike. I had to avert my eyes, I looked over at Juan. Who was now staring at me with his one unswollen eye. 

“Shhh.” He whispered. My eyes shot to Stein. Who was still standing over the woman’s body. Then back to Juan, but found that Juan had vanished. My eyes grew large. I had no idea where the man went. Images of Raiden bashing my head in started flying through my mind. 

Then came the voice that made my blood run cold. 

“Where did Maximón go?” Stein asked.

I turned and looked back at him. 

“I-I don’t..” I started. 

Stein rolled his eyes. 

“Damn it Deckard.. Raiden.. Kill someone else!” He said. 

Raiden only raised his hand towards another random patron and fired another blue lightning bolt. This one was so bright it was almost blinding. It happened quick. One of the men who’d been hiding under a table has his torso blown apart. Crispy human meat and blood was sent in all directions. 

I sat there speechless. At least I was until the nausea suddenly caught up to me and I vomited all over the floor. 

Stein eyed me for a second. Then he opened his mouth to speak. But before he could get the words out his eyes suddenly shot to the back door. His face morphed into an almost intrigued expression. The one that had become unguarded after Artemis had gone to the front. My eyes turned to see what he was staring at. Maximón was standing there with a vial in his hand. A vial of what looked to me like blood.

“Let everyone out of here or I’ll destroy it!” He commanded. 

Stein rolled his eyes. 

“Do you even know what your holding? Do you know whose blood that is?” Stein asked. 

“I don’t care! Now let these people go!” 

“Why are you so concerned for the humans? You were gonna kill that one!” Stein said as he pointed at me. 

Maximón eyed me for a split second before looking down at the floor. 

“It would have been a mercy. That man is already dead.” He said in a soft tone. 

He was right of course. It hurt my heart to think about. I sank down a little bit. Stein scoffed.

“Eesh! That’s harsh! Even for me!” He said as he took another breath. Then turned to me and smiled. “And he’s supposed to be one of the good guys!” 

“Let these people go! I mean it! I’ll destroy it!” Maximón barked as he raised the vial up like he was gonna shatter it on the floor.

Stein wasn’t even remotely bothered by this. He took a deep breath, then before I knew it, he had seemingly teleported across the room. He’d snatched Maximón by his wrist and throat. 

“Where’s your boss?” Stein asked. 

“Fuck… You…” Maximón wheezed.

“Why does everyone keep saying that?” Stein asked as he turned to Raiden, who only shrugged. 

That was when an arrow flew through the window and landed in the center of the room with a loud thunk noise. Stein turned and looked at it with a smirk. The arrow was a sleek silvery color, with what looked like some kind of spherical canister below the tip. One that I didn’t get a very good look at before it suddenly exploded. My vision went white as my eyes burned. My ears suddenly rang like bells I could barely hear the commotion going on around me. I fell into the fetal position. Keeping my eyes shut and my ears covered. 

I’m not sure how long I was down there. I know it seemed like hours but was probably only seconds. I also know that I was ripped out of it by a hand yanking me up by the back of my shirt and beginning to drag me. The room had become a mess. Half the patrons had somehow escaped while the other half had been slaughtered. Their bodies were in pieces on the floor. Some charred from lightning. Some full of Artemis’s arrows. The bar was on fire as well. Not like in the sense that the building was burning around me. I mean the literal fucking bar where I’d been sitting was ablaze. It took me a second to figure out who was dragging me across the room. It was Stein himself. His clothes were singed but he seemed more annoyed then anything. I managed to look directly behind myself. Where I found Artemis covering our exit with her bow. Ahead of her lay several dead men in tactical uniforms. 

Adrian Stein pulled me out the back of the bar and into an alleyway. Artemis was right behind us. He sat me up against the wall and bent down next to me. 

“Well that was fun! I got the vial!” He said as he excitedly dangled it in front of me. 

“You got what you wanted! What do you still need me for?” I asked. 

“I told you Mr. Deckland, you’re gonna have to make a choice!” He said with a smug grin. 

“It’s Deckard!” I corrected.

“Do you know what sends people to hell Mr. Deckland?” 

I exhaled with annoyance, my ears were still ringing. 

“It’s the negative energy associated with guilt.. Which is something you humans are sooooo fucking good at. Like, I’ve been across the entire multiverse, and I’ve never seen a species capable of so much self loathing. And I know the actual devil!” 

I could see past him as Artemis suddenly aimed her bow down the alleyway. 

“Loxley!” She snarled. 

I turned my head to see a man standing there with a bow raised. He had longer dark red hair and an eyepatch over his left eyeball. 

“Artemis! What’d you run out of bank robbers to kill? Moved up to innocent people I see!” The man said with a smirk.  

Stein looked at Artemis, then me, then back at Artemis, then at this Loxley fellow. 

“Mr. Loxley!! What’s it been? Two-three hundred years?” Stein asked. 

“Where’s Maximón?” the one eyed archer demanded. 

“He’s with some of my associates! Where’s Cain?” Stein asked in response. 

“He’s not stupid enough to come out here with you!” Loxley replied. 

“And you are? Tell me, do you really think this is a fight you can win?” Stein asked.

Loxley raised his eyebrows, “Not in a thousand years. But I need the vial.” 

“What would someone like you need a vial of Lucifer’s blood for?” Asked Stein. 

“Ask Cain.. I’m just a thief with magic arrows!” Loxley said as he aimed for Stein and let loose an arrow. 

The arrow moved at an ungodly speed. It moved in the blink of an eye. But Stein caught it like it was nothing more then a mild annoyance. Stein examined the arrow while Artemis let loose a few arrows of her own. I watched Loxley dodge and duck to evade them while returning fire. Stein looked down at me and smiled before snapping his fingers. The next thing I knew we were on a rooftop. I was still on my ass while Stein stood still holding the arrow. He tossed it off the roof while he fished the vial of blood from his pocket. 

“That’s Lucifer’s blood? As in the actual devil’s blood?” I asked. 

“The one and only.” Stein said. 

“So hell and all that is real?” I asked. 

“We call it Gehenna.” 

“But it’s real?” I asked as I thought about my illness. 

Stein turned to me and tilted his head. 

“It’s all setting in now.. Isn’t it?” He asked as he squatted back down ahead of me. 

“Am I going? To hell I mean?” I asked. 

Stein shrugged, “I told you Mr. Deckland.. It depends on how guilty you are.” 

I considered this for a second. I didn’t have much that I truly felt guilty for. Not at the time. 

“But if hell exists.. Then so does heaven.” I said. 

Stein nodded. “Correct.”

I thought about it for a second while Stein studied my closely. Could I actually get into heaven? Did I have any major regrets? Any damning personality traits? 

“Mr. Deckard, unfortunately your night isn’t over yet.. We still have one more thing to do.” 

I looked at him quizzically. 

“Now that you know one of the secrets of the universe.. Mr. Deckard… Are you still afraid of dying?” 

I thought about it for a second. I wasn’t sure. I mean yes, I now knew there was an after life but I wasn’t sure if I would end up where I wanted to be. 

“Well now I’ve gone from not knowing if I’ll cease to exist to not knowing if I’ll be tortured for eternity sooo.. Yeah.” I said. “I am still afraid.” 

Stein nodded as he produced a pill bottle from his pocket. One marked EZ on the label.

“Well.. My companies advanced science division made this. It can help you. I won’t say how. But it would terminate the cancer that’s killing you so slowly…” 

“What’s the catch?” I asked. 

Stein smiled almost sinisterly. 

“I give you these. The bomb I left in the bar goes off.”

I raised a brow. 
“The bar that everyone still living evacuated during the struggle?” I asked. 

Stein shrugged, “Maybe they did.. Maybe they didn’t. Maybe emergency personnel are in there right now.. Are you willing to take the chance?” 

I thought for a second. I could be cured. I could live. This could save my life. I mean… I saw everyone still living leave. I couldn’t possibly turn that down. I couldn’t possibly turn this opportunity down. 

“There has to be some kind of trick here.” I said. 

“The only trick is the decision. You get to live, and I set off a bomb and you live with whatever consequences come with it. You choose not too.. And I’ll kill you myself right now.” He said in a more serious tone. 

I could feel my heart jump into my throat. 

“You are the devil..” I murmured.

Stein took a deep annoyed breath. 

“Don’t compare me to my father.. After his first rebellion he became a pushover.. A coward.. I am much, much, worse then he ever was. Now make a fucking decision!” 

My face contorted in a mixture of shock and awe. His eyes seemed to go black as he conjured a burning Scarlett sword out of thin air. Primal fear seemed to take over my thinking. There was no fight. There was no flight. Just survival. He raised the sword over his head. I panicked. 

“I choose life!” I squealed. 

Stein brought the sword down hard. Only stopping a few inches from my face. I could feel the flames off the scarlet blade licking my forehead. Stein lowered the sword. 

“Very well..” he said as the sword vanished. 

An explosion rang out in the distance behind me. A large one by the sound of it. I’m not sure because I didn’t take my eyes off of the man or monster that was standing before me. Stein looked down at me with an almost sadistic grin. 

“You humans are all the same. Even when you know there’s something after you’re still to afraid to die. You probably would have gone to heaven if you’d just died like a man.” 

“And now?“ I asked.

“We’ll see..” Stein said right before he vanished into thin air. 

I’m not sure how long I sat atop that roof. The pill bottle in my hands. I know I watch the bar burn from afar. I could hear the sirens of police and fire trucks in the distance. I’m not sure if anyone else died in the bombing. I’ve always been too afraid to do the research and check. Not that I could anyway. This happened five years ago and had never appeared on the news. I guess everyone was too focused on whatever political BS was trendy at the time. It still haunts me at night though. Thoughts of people being blown to smithereens because I wasn’t man enough to die. I’ve done my best to try and move on with my life. Let go and be thankful for this gift I’ve been given. But I’m not sure what it cost me.. Am I going to hell?

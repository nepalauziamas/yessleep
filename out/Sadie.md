I love my daughter, I really do. It's not her fault that we can't go out in public anymore. That's on me, my own anxiety. I just can't do it anymore and I don't know how to get help for a situation like this. 

Sadie's "father" left when I was pregnant with her. You know the old stereotype about going out for cigarettes and never coming back? Well, he went out on a Boys Night and came back six days later to get a few belongings. I never saw the motherfucker again. 

Funnily enough, the pregnancy was easier without his dumb ass around. No nausea, no pains, just tired. The birth was "easy" for a first (and only?) timer, and fast. Everything was worth it when the nurse passed me my perfect baby girl. 

She was a pretty good baby, however she had extreme separation anxiety and seemed terrified of strangers. 
She started talking before she was two... And this is where the trouble started. 

The Annual Craft Co-op was happening in our town, two weeks before Sadie's 2nd birthday. I loved going before I was pregnant and couldn't wait to get my girl some cute smocked dresses and lovingly stitched snuggly toys. 
The old ladies all fussed over Sadie, which made her hide behind me. She peeped around my legs and stared intently at Mrs. Buller, one of the well-known crafters in our small town. Mrs. Buller was around 90 years old and had pale lilac hair and bright jewellery.. Unfortunately that is not what had Sadie's attention. 

"Mama, that lady runned over someone with her car and they got dead." Sadie blurted from behind me. 

It went deathly quiet as everyone stared at us, then Mrs. Buller burst into tears. 

"It was.. a long time ago... thirty years..." she sobbed, before leaving the room. It was a blur after that as I apologised profusely, tried to explain that no I hadn't told my toddler that, no I didn't know anything about the incident, sorry sorry sorry... We left quickly with all eyes glaring after us. 

Since then, Sadie would tell me little things at the supermarket. "That daddy hurt his little boy." "That lady killed her dog." I taught her that if she must share these insights, to keep her voice low and just tell Mama. It didn't make it easier for the anxiety but it avoided any more drama, I reasoned. 

Sadie was almost four when I finally got placed for a specialist appointment on my old knee injury. We were to drive three hours to the city where the hospital was. Sadie liked long car rides, and we hadn't had a major episode in around 6 months by that point so it wasn't too much of a worry. 

The appointment itself was uneventful, I needed further imaging scans and physio. Sadie was a perfect angel, coloring in her little notebook while she waited. I thought maybe we could hit up a department store afterwards to pick up a few treats. 

We had been inside the toy section for 25 minutes before a man stepped into the aisle. Sadie slowly turned and stared at him. He was tall, very thin. Greasy hair combed over his balding head, sunken cheeks, minding his own business as he stared at the prices of Lego sets. Sadie began to scream. 

I'd never seen Sadie melt down like this. She tore at her long brown hair, smacked her own face, pushed over a stack of junior craft kits. She screamed and wailed, snot and tears wetting the front of her purple romper. She even tried to kick me and claw at my face as I scooped her up and marched her out. The man never looked up from the lego, it's like he didn't notice her at all. All other eyes bore into us as I wrangled my fitful child into the car park. 

Inside our car, I held her tight. "deep breaths baby, are you hurt, did you get a fright, Mama's here... Mama's here, its going to be okay."

Sadie eventually quieted right down. The three hour drive back home was completely silent. She didn't want music. She didn't nap. She threw up twice, never before having troubles with travel sickness. 

Cuddled up on the couch at home, Sadie finally was able to articulate what she'd seen. 

"The man at the store, he came to my house. My old house, a long time ago, when I had yellow hair. He breaked the door and came in. He hurt my other Mama with a knife and she was.. had blood.. she got dead. Then he put me in a hole and punch, punch my tummy. My bones got all broken, then I woke up and I was a baby with you, Mama."

We haven't left the house in eight months.

So, let me ask you all something? You know sock-monkeys, right? You know how they’re *usually* supposed to be plushy and cuddly? I mean, I remember how *I* used to think they were kinda cool. Monkeys were always my favorite animal and these things just *screamed* “hug me close and snuggle”, you know what I mean?

They were relatively cheap, too, leastways back in the day. Like I said, when I was little, I used to want one, but my mom always found them creepy for some reason. I never understood why. “They just... look *WEIRD...*” she’d always say with a look of disgust.

Anyways, I say this to say that I’m pretty sure, if you had one, you’d have had fond, or at least decent memories of it, right? You wouldn’t have attributed some of your worst nightmares to it, right? If that’s the case, well then, let me introduce to you: “Kalliban”.

“Kalliban” was my grandmother’s gift to my son, Percy, two weeks ago for his seventh birthday. Now, before you ask why, in this day and age, she would get him a sock monkey instead of like a new phone or IPad or a gift card or something like that, understand that she was very much old fashioned when it came to getting gifts for kids. In other words, she’s one of the types to believe that “technology has made kids forget the values of family”, and “that’s why kids are soft these days”, and of course, “all this new stuff is why kids have no imagination now”.

Basically, she believed Percy would be better off if she’d gotten him just a regular old toy instead of any of the things I mentioned. She was the same with me and my brother, Landon, growing up. We didn’t really have a lot of money, so stuff like that was always considered “cool” to us; just regular old action figures or stuffed animals. She usually got them from thrift stores or yard sales, at least, if she wasn’t able to actually make them herself (that little talent earned her the nickname “our Mrs. Claus” from me and Landon).

So anyway, yeah, my grandmother got him a sock monkey. I remember the look on Percy’s face as soon as he unwrapped it, the look of confusion. Personally, I couldn’t exactly blame him. Like I said, it was a pretty weird idea, plus all of his other gifts were stuff like new headphones, movies, and a couple of video games. “What is it?” he asked, looking at it sideways.

“It’s a sock monkey” my grandmother replied. He looked to her, confusion still chiseled on his little face.

“What’s it do?” He started turning the toy around in his hands.

“Well, he can be a nice little pal to snuggle with. You can go on adventures and all kinds of stuff with him, anywhere your imagination takes ya.”

“Can he talk?” Percy asked.

“He can talk, walk, and anything... just gotta use your imagination!” My grandmother winked when she said this. His face sunk. I could tell he was disappointed, but was trying his best (the best you could reasonably expect a 7-year old to anyways) not to let it show.

“What do you say?” I urged.

“Oh, uh... thank you Gammie Edith.” he said, still not quite masking the disappointment.

“You’re welcome, kiddo.” She said, giving him a kiss on the top of his head. Percy just kept looking at the sock monkey in his hands, cocking his eyebrows. I decided to use that time to unveil the present *I’d* kept stashed away; a Nintendo Switch.

Of course, this immediately drew his attention from the sock monkey, tossing it to the side with his other gifts in excitement as he unwrapped the Switch. While he was enthralled with that, I picked up the sock monkey and turned it around in my own hands. The first thing that stood out to me was the color of the thing.

You know how most sock monkeys were usually white and gray, right; reminiscent of the color of socks (you know, hence the name)? Sure, some might be different colors, but *generally* they still kept the color or aesthetic of socks. Well, *this one* was dark brown. At first, I thought it was just REALLY dirty or something, which would’ve made sense, given that it was likely from a yard sale or something.

But looking closer, I realized that no, the stitching was just naturally that color; dark, dirt brown. Another thing I noticed was that, instead of the typical little cap you see on a sock monkey; the kind with the little bits of red string coming from it, this one’s “cap” was a sort of shiny, almost metallic looking sorta helmet looking thing.

The eyes were also a dark red color, deep and bright, like rubies. For a moment, I almost half expected them to start glowing or something. *”No wonder ma used to find these things creepy back in the day.”* I thought, staring into its stitched eyes. I wasn’t sure why, but I felt like something was just... off, I guess. In any event, I sat it back down with the other presents.

*”Where’d she pick this up from?”* Eventually, things started to die down and the guests started heading out. Percy himself was playing around with his new Switch. The sock monkey still just laid there, discarded among the torn wrapping paper.

“Guess he doesn’t like it, huh?” My grandmother asked from behind me. I snapped around to her. She looked dejectedly at it. She sighed and added, “I remember how you and Landon liked that kind of thing.”

I felt bad. “Times have changed.” I said.

“I know...” she replied, sighing again in disappointment. “I guess I’ll take it back if—“

“No,” I said, interrupting her, “I mean, we’ll keep it.”

“You sure?”

“Yeah, I know you tried to put some thought into it when you got it. He’ll grow on it.” She gave me a small smile at this before looking back at the sock monkey. “If nothing else,” I added, “It’ll be something kinda neat to have around the house.”

She thanked me and was turning to leave when I stopped her. “One question, if you don’t mind me asking, but exactly where’d you find it?” She paused and thought for a moment.

“You know,” she said, sounding uncertain, “It’s strange. See, I’d never seen the person before, least not in any of my frequent yard sale hotspots.” I raised an eyebrow, cocking my head in confusion at her.

“You know, the ones that are *always* out on Saturdays, up there on Sallow St.?” I nodded my head. It was true, it was always the same people, same place, and same time each week. They even formed like a little union or inner circle of yard sale merchants.

“Well,” she continued, “this past Saturday when I was down there, there was a new guy there. He looked kinda weird, with a whole bunch of dream catchers , candles, and porcelain figurines with religious looking designs on them, ya know? The man was Indian, Hindu possibly, and looked middle aged. I asked around if any of the others knew who he was; thinkin’ maybe he was a new one they brought into the fold. But Nope; nobody knew zip about him or who the heck he even was.”

“He say anything to you?”

She shook her head. “Nope, ‘Cept that that thing there was gonna run me about $25.00.” My eyes went wide with shock.

“$25.00?” I exclaimed, “What the hell for? It’s a *toy*.” She chuckled.

“That’s what I thought, too. He told me, though that it was some sort of heirloom or somethin’; passed down the line from his family for generations. I wondered why he was wanting to hock it, so I asked him.”

“And?” She shrugged her shoulders.

“Wouldn’t tell me. He just said I could have it for twenty-five and I thought Percy might think it was cool.” She looked at him; still nose-deep in his game. “Oh well...” she sighed.

I patted her on the back, “Don’t worry, he’ll come around to it, I’m sure.” We then exchanged goodbyes and she left. Then, the house was empty again; just me and Percy. As I was cleaning up, I looked over to see Percy, passed out with his Switch in his lap. I grinned, *”Poor kid, tuckered himself out already, huh?”*

I decided to leave him there, let him sleep off the cake and ice cream from earlier, while I finished cleaning. While I did, I ran across the sock monkey again. Honestly, had I not ran across it again, I probably would’ve forgotten it was even there. There it was, though, glaring back up at me with its dark, crimson eyes. I picked it up and placed it in Percy’s lap, on top of his game.

By the time all of that was all said and done; cleaning up from the party, it was around 8:45 PM. It was pitch dark outside. I, personally, was exhausted, as I’m pretty sure most moms would be after throwing their kid’s birthday party at their house. I looked into the living room; Percy was still out cold.

I yawned. *”Just let him sleep.”* I thought, heading to my bedroom. *”It won’t hurt if I allow it just this once, will it? I mean, it’s his birthday, after all...”*

That night, everything was pretty much fine and well, until I woke up to go to the bathroom. Making my way down the hall, I started hearing what sounded like Percy whispering. I couldn’t really tell what it was that was being said. Whatever it was, was soft, plus, I was still half asleep anyway. That being said, I still moved closer toward the living room where it was coming from to see if I could hear it a little more clearly.

The closer I got, the more I started to realize that they didn’t sound like actual words. Instead, it was more like a light mix of muffled shrieks and grunts. I reached the end of the hallway and peered around the corner. “Percy?” I called out softly.

He was still vegged out in the living room floor. He had the sock monkey clutched close to his chest. His head was stirring from side to side, constantly muttering whatever those noises were. For a second, I just stood there, watching him. Admittedly, had it not been a a quarter till 4 in the morning, I’d likely have actually found this cute, if not at least funny as hell.

That being said, though, I just smirked, rolled my eyes and continued to the bathroom. When I was passing by the living room again, though, headed back to my room, Percy let out a sharp series of high pitched shrieking that damn near caused my heart to stop.

I snapped my head to see Percy writhing on the floor, howling like an animal. “Percy?!” I called out, rushing to him. As soon as I got to him though, his body relaxed and he was sound asleep again. I stood for a moment, frozen in shock. *”What the hell was that?!”*

I watched him for a minute, wondering if he’d start fidgeting and shrieking again. He didn’t, though. He was fast asleep, even softly snoring a little. I took a deep breath, *”Calm down, he was probably just talking (well, okay, shrieking) in his sleep; probably having some weird dream or something.”* with that, I finally got up and made my way back to my room.

It was around 11:00 the next morning that I was woken up by sounds of jumping around coming from the living room. Groggy, I shuffled out of the bed and went to the living room. There, Percy was jumping around, scratching his head and ribs while bouncing around on the couch, shrieking. In the middle of the floor, the sock monkey sat upright.

“Percy!” He stopped and looked at me, startled. “What the heck do you think you’re doing?!” He shrank, curling up into his knees; something he did anytime he felt embarrassed or caught off guard.

“Kalliban wanted me to dance for him.” he replied timidly. I cocked my eyebrow at him.

“Kalliban?” He pointed to the toy. I looked at it, it glaring lifelessly back at me.

“That’s his name. Kalliban’s the king of the monkeys.” I looked back to him. His face was serious when he said this, the way all seven year olds would be serious when telling you something like this, of course. “I’m sorry, mom.”

I sighed, pinching the bridge of my nose. “It’s fine.” I said, resigned, “just... next time, tell “Kalliban” here that that sort of thing is an “outside only” activity, okay?” He nodded his head, smiling, before grabbing “Kalliban” and heading to the backyard.

Again, despite being annoyed at having been woke up like this (it was my day off and I’d planned to sleep in — something I’m not really able to do often), I still couldn’t help but find the little situation amusing. For one thing, it was nice to see that he *was* at least trying to get some use out of his great grandmother’s present, despite it not being something he’d usually have been interested in. Secondly, it was just nice to see him jumping around and having fun, just being a goofy little kid, you know?

I took a shower before heading to the kitchen to make something for lunch. As I was cooking, the phone started ringing. It was my friend, Mandy, calling to see if I’d be cool with her little boy, Colton, coming over for a sleepover. She said she was gonna be at the hospital, visiting her mother overnight, and that Colton was chomping at the bit to hang out with Percy.

I told her that was fine. Percy and Colton had been friends, essentially, since they were in diapers (me and Mandy being besties since high school), so I figured he’d love it. Mandy said she’d drop by with Colton in about an hour and a half before hanging up. I finished cooking lunch and called Percy in.

“Guess who’s coming over in a little bit?” I asked excitedly as I sat down at the table with him. He just looked back at me. “Colton. He’ll be coming over for a sleepover!” I expected him to glow up at this, whooping and cheering. Instead, though, he just looked disinterested.

“Oh...” he said, “um, okay, cool.”

“What’s wrong? Don’t you like hanging out with Colton?” He shrugged.

“I do... just...” he trailed off, holding up “Kalliban”

“What?”

“Well, Kalliban told me that tonight was the night of ‘the gathering’.”

“What’s that?” I asked, thinking of what kind of ridiculous type of story he was gonna come up with this time, like with the whole “dancing for the monkey king” thing from earlier.

“He says that every night there’s a full moon, his subjects gather around a fire and have a big feast where they give gifts to him.”

“A big feast, huh?” I asked slyly, an idea hatching in my mind.

“Yeah, and if I don’t do it, Kalliban will get angry.” He looked nervously at me, shaking his head. “And you DONT wanna make Kalliban angry.”

I made my own eyes go wide, playing along. “Well, then we better make sure we attend, huh?” He nodded wildly. “Tell you what, how about we have a fire in the backyard? We can have a bowl of bananas for “Kalliban” while we make some hot dogs and S’mores. How’s that sound?”

He seemed to lighten up at that idea. “That’s perfect! Except that Kalliban doesn’t eat bananas.” I frowned, confused.

“Well, what *does* he eat?”

“He likes meat, just like you and me. And he’s gotta have a LOT of it. He gets VERY hungry.”

“I see..” I replied, nodding my head. “Well then, tell you what, why don’t you, me, “Kalliban” there, and Colton have a little backyard cookout tonight? We can even set out the tents and have a camp out!”

“That’s perfect!” He exclaimed. He turned to the sock monkey and said, “Hear that, Kalliban; we can have the gathering in the backyard!” I giggled at this.

About three minutes after we finished with lunch, the doorbell rang. As soon as I opened the door, Colton zipped past me, straight to Percy. “Hey Percy!” He squealed. The two embraced each other and started running around the living room.

“Thank you for doing this.” Mandy said.

“Of course, Percy and I were actually just talking about doing a little backyard camping, so I figured; three’s a party.”

“That sounds fun! Yeah, Colton’s been *dying* for a play date, and I knew he’d have been bored out of his mind at the hospital.”

“How is your mom, anyway?”

“Docs say she’s holding out fine for right now, but I’m still worried, I mean, it was so sudden when she collapsed the other day and if I hadn’t have been there—“

Percy’s voice broke my attention from her, “Hey mom, we’re going outside to get ready for ‘the gathering’.”

“Okay, sweetie, I’ll be out there in a minute.” I called.

“The gathering?” Mandy asked, chuckling amusedly.

“Yeah, it’s this thing with one of his new toys.” She laughed and we said goodbye before she left. After that, I started gathering the supplies; tents, sleeping bags, you know, usual fare. I decided that I'd use the old grill top to roast some of the bratwursts that'd been sitting in the fridge for almost three weeks.

As I was coming out, I saw Colton come running back in. I could tell from the look of panic he had on his face that something was up. "Colton, what's wrong?" I asked gingerly. He looked at me, tears starting to form in his eyes. "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"

He darted his head over to the sliding glass door to the backyard. Percy was standing in the middle of the yard; sock monkey dangling from one hand, a large stick in the other. "What's going on?" I asked urgently.

"He's trying to hurt me with that stick!" he cried, clutching my leg. I looked over to the glass again. Percy held up the stick. "He says Kalliban wants him to beat me up with it! Don't let him hurt me!" He started blubbering at this.

I pulled him close and told him I wasn't gonna let Percy hurt him. I went over and opened the door to the backyard, telling him to come inside. "Percy, You mind telling me what's going on?" I asked sternly. He looked blankly at me. He looked like he thought everything was fine. "What's that stick for?"

He looked at it, and then to "Kalliban". He then held "Kalliban" up and said, "Kalliban said he wanted Colton as a gift."

I raised my eyebrow, "Huh? What are you talking about?" He held him up again.

"Kalliban said I have to get him a gift for "the gathering" tonight. He said I had to give him Colton."

"So you intend to do that by trying to hit him with a stick?!" He shrank a bit at this. I didn't know what to do or say. I was honestly shocked now more than anything. Percy never tried anything like this before -- he wasn't a violent kid.

"I'm sorry, Mom. I don't wanna hurt Colton, But I don't wanna make Kalliban mad, either." He looked at "Kalliban" and I actually noticed how he looked afraid of him, like he had just threatened him or something. 

*"What's going on, here?"* I wondered. Now shock was being replaced with confusion. "Why can't you give something else to Kalliban?" I asked, hoping still that this was all still just a silly game, one that I still had a chance of keeping from going too far. He just kept staring at the sock monkey. 

"Kalliban says it *has* to be Colton, Mama." he replied, timidly. 

"Okay, well, no one's gonna be "giving" anyone as a 'gift', understood?" He looked pleadingly at me.

"B-but"

"No 'buts'!" I snapped. "Now, either you get your act together, or you can sit in your room while me and Colton camp out in the backyard. What's it gonna be?" For a moment, he just stared back up at me and then looked to Colton before looking back to me, dropping the stick, and telling me he'd behave himself.

"Got something you wanna say to Colton?" He looked to Colton, who was still clutching onto my leg. 

"I'm sorry for trying to hit you with the stick." Colton let go of my leg and walked over to Percy.

"It's okay." he said, embracing Percy in a giant hug. Percy just stood there, still looking frightened. The next couple of hours were spent relatively peaceful, with me and the boys setting up the tent and building the fire pit. 

Soon, night had fallen and the three of us were sitting around the fire, roasting our bratwursts. Colton and I were actually having a blast, between telling silly "knock-knock jokes" and singing campfire songs. The only one, it seemed, who *wasn't* having fun, was Percy. "What's wrong, Percy?" Colton asked, noticing the constant look of anxiety he'd had plastered on his face almost the entire time. Percy just sat there, clutching "Kalliban" close to him, staring intently at the fire. 

"You okay, honey?" I asked, "Here, why don't you roast a brat with us." I handed him a skewer and a bratwurst. He didn't move. 

"I'm not hungry..." he said. 

"You sure?" asked Colton, his mouth still full, "They're *really* good!" He then attempted to hand him the one he was roasting, "Here, why don't you have this one?"

Percy took it and held it over the fire. "I'll give this one to Kalliban." he said, having finished roasting it. He held it to the sock monkey's mouth. "Go on," he urged, "Eat up." The Brat just rested on the skewer, untouched.

 "Maybe Kalliban doesn't want it." Colton said. "Can I have it if he won't eat it?" He tried to reach for it, only to have his hand batted away by Percy. 

"No!" he shouted, "This one's for Kalliban!" Colton retracted, looking startled. 

"Percy!" I snapped. I was once again taken by surprise by his drastic change in behavior. "That was rude, what were you thinking?!" 

"He was gonna take Kalliban's bratwurst, mom!" he cried. "That would've made him mad. And he's already mad because I can't give him anything for 'The gathering'." I closed my eyes, trying to keep my cool. 

*"Why is he obsessing over this damn sock monkey so much?"*

 "Okay, well since you're apparently more concerned with "Kalliban" being happy than being nice to your friend, maybe you should take "Kalliban" and spend the rest of the night in your room alone."

"B-but..." he started. 

"No "buts". Inside. NOW!" His head fell and he got up and trudged his way back inside the house. Colton used the opportunity to take the uneaten bratwurst for himself. The two of us just sat in relative silence for a little while longer, roasting a few of the marshmallows I'd brought out as well until the fire finally started dying down to embers. 

I caught Colton yawning, beginning to nod in and out of sleep. I figured, the fire having died down by that point (plus it was likely getting to be 15 minutes till midnight anyway), I decided it was time to hit the sack for the night; or in our case, the sleeping bags. We had gotten all cozied up in the tent, Colton going out like a light as soon as he laid down, and I was soon to follow when, faintly, I heard what sounded like some sort of shrieking coming from farther away. 

This prompted me to look outside the tent toward the house. Sure enough, the sounds seemed louder the closer I listened in that direction. *"What is that? What's he doing in there?"* The lights were all still turned off, like I had left them when we first came out here, and I couldn't hear any other sounds, such as anything breaking or him jumping around again. I briefly remembered the outbursts from late the previous night.

*"Maybe he's just having another weird dream again."* With this, I zipped the tent back up and laid back down. After about maybe a minute, I finally managed to doze off completely. Now, I don't exactly how long I was out for, but I remember it was still pitch dark outside when I was woken up to the deranged shrieking sounds again; this time much closer to the tent, along with a series of swift *WHACKS*. 

I stirred awake and immediately, I started panicking. The first thing I noticed was that the tent was wide open. When I looked beside me, I saw that Colton wasn't there. Even his sleeping bag was gone!

When I looked outside this time, my heart stopped dead in my chest. There, in the middle of the yard, was Percy. He was in his underwear, standing in front of the fire with his back facing me with the stick grasped tightly in his hands. In front of him, "Kalliban" was propped upright in one of the chairs. Percy started jumping again, shrieking wildly and swinging the stick down hard on something. 

"Percy?!" I called out, "Percy, what're you doing out he-" My words caught in my throat when I looked closer and saw, illuminated faintly by the glow of the embers, that, on the ground below my son, was Colton. He laid on the ground, unmoving, his face so badly broken and beaten that it was barely recognizable anymore. Percy's head snapped over to look at me. His eyes were wild, psychotic even; like the eyes of a rabid animal. My breath was lost. I was frozen in shock.

He started shrieking at me before bounding towards me with the stick. So caught up in the terror of what I was seeing, I almost didn't get out of the way before he swung the stick directly at my head. Fortunately, I managed to duck just in time before it could hit me. "PERCY!" I cried out, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING, STOP! IT'S ME, IT'S MOM!"

It was no use, though. Whether because he couldn't hear me, or because he was just so out of his mind; he ignored my pleas and continued viciously swinging the stick at me, shrieking. A few of his swings caught me, one to the head, which knocked me dizzy, as well as one shot in the ribs that took the wind out of me. Pain started shooting through my body as the stick hit me more and more all over my body. I managed to catch the stick and force it away from him, where he then leapt forward and started punching me in the face, still making his deranged animal noises. 

I struggled, despite having thirty years and at least 150lbs on him, to force him off of me. When I was finally able to, I staggered my way back into the house. I closed and locked the sliding glass door. Percy charged towards it, lunging forward and smashing the stick against it. Surprisingly, the glass was actually able to hold up against this. As he kept battering against it with the stick, though, I knew that wouldn't be the case for much longer and I grabbed the telephone from the kitchen before running into and locking myself in my room. I immediately dialed 9-1-1. 

I was barely able to hold myself together enough to tell them what was going on; that my son was out of his mind and just brutalized his friend with a stick and was now trying to get me, too. I ended up dropping the phone out of fright when I heard the sound of the stick shattering the bedroom window. I could hear him shrieking as he began pulling his way up through the shattered window. I bolted down the hall and into the bathroom, where I locked myself in and huddled in the bathtub.

I heard him coming down the hall and start battering the bathroom door. Every crash against the door shook all throughout my body, causing my heart to skip beats like crazy. I closed my eyes, silently praying that the door could hold out. 

Eventually, the beating against the door stopped. Everything was quiet. I stayed frozen stiff in the bathtub. *"Is he gone?"* 

I didn't move for a while. Eventually, I worked up the courage to reach for the doorknob, only to instantly retract back when I heard footsteps stomping towards the door again. A knock sounded from the other side, followed by a deep voice saying "Someone in here?" I realized it was the police. I climbed out of the tub and unlocked the door. Outside waiting were two police officers. "Ma'am, are you alright?"

"Wh-Where is he?!" I stammered. I started looking in every direction. The officer grabbed my shoulders gently. "My son, Where is he?! Where'd he go?!"

"Calm down, Ma'am." instructed the officer, "Everything's fine, there's no one else here." My breathing started to just barely return to normal. "Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere severely?" I absently shook my head. So much of my attention was still on high alert that I barely heard his voice. 

It stayed that way as they led me out if the bathroom, into the living room. There, I saw a few of them with an ambulance, wheeling Colton out of the backyard. They asked me questions about what happened leading up to this, to which I told them the truth as I knew it. When they asked me if Percy had had any history of psychotic or violent fits like this, I, again told them he wouldn't have hurt a fly even to save his life before, which was the truth. 

They soon left after doing about the third or fourth sweep of the area for him, coming up empty handed. This was just last week. He hasn't been seen since, by me or anyone else that I'm aware of. In a way, I almost hope it stays that way, for a little while, at least. 

I won't lie, I'm terrified here. I'm scared both for him, as well as *of* him. Most importantly, though, I'm worried for the next person that does run into him. I love Percy, but whatever's happened, that's not him anymore. I don't know how, or why, but I know that it has *something* to do with that godforsaken sock monkey, "Kalliban". Either, despite there, again, being no history of such, Percy has developed "Kalliban" as a sort of dual personality that apparently carries horrifyingly violent tendencies, or somehow, in some way I couldn't possibly understand, it has managed to manifest some sort of malicious power or something through my son, causing it to control him. 

I can't help but find either option morbidly ironic, though. My grandmother gave this thing to him as a gift, meant to "fuel his imagination". Yet, in either instance, The nightmare became very real.

"Who doesn't hate clickbait? It was bad enough when it was just online, but now it follows us in the real world as well. Print media now on its deathbed tries to emulate online media by being as obnoxious as possible."

This was the first thought that popped into my mind the first time I saw that accursed newspaper. The Orcus Tribune, I think it was called. You see, I live in a city and take the underground to work every day. People sometimes take a newspaper with them on the tube, pretend to read it, and then promptly get back to scrolling on Instagram like everybody else. As a result, dozens of newspapers lay about abandoned.

It was a very weird newspaper.  Firstly, it was written in a Gothic font, like it was from pre-WWII Germany, or something. Then it had no photos to speak of, only hand-drawn black and white pictures. Curiosity got the best of me, and I picked it up. Not being used to the typeface, I had a hard time reading it, but after a while I was able to decipher headlines such as:

* The Death Of DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER And How To Avoid It
* Does DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER Sometimes Make You Feel Stupid?
* Warning: These 9 Mistakes Will Destroy Your DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER
* Using 7 DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER Strategies Like The Pros
* Marriage And DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER Have More In Common Than You Think

"Must be a hard rock band," I thought. "They always have edgy, nonsensical names. But then again, DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER could also be a euphemism for someone's private parts." I chuckled at the thought that someone would be so immature. So, I put the paper down and took my phone out.

I had forgotten all about the bizarre newspaper until I found the following edition the next week. Same silly headlines. "Don't they have anything else to talk about?" I thought. Then it occurred to me that it could be some sort of far right paper. "It all fits: the Gothic script, the low-budget, the cryptic language, everything. The Monster could even be whoever it is they don't like. Wait. Can't be though. They always talk positively about this Monster. Must be the authoritarian leader they'd like to see installed in power."

A few weeks in a row I'd find the same newspaper in the train.  Always similar headlines. Always about something called DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER. Then no more Tribune for a few months, until last Friday. One of the articles was titled: "How To Start DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER With Less Than $100". This time I read the whole article. I was thoroughly amused. It was about some old lady selling her Monster for 69 bucks. "It's got to be sexual," I said to myself. "Why else would she ask for **that** sum?" At the end of the article, there was even her phone number.

I decided to prank the old woman, so I called the number. An old woman with a coarse voice and harsh tone answered. I asked about the Monster.

"What Monster?"

"Well, the one you advertised in the Tribune."

"Yes, my old Degrumo. It's just weird hearing you call it that. For a moment I was worried you were an outsider, but since you're a subscriber to the Tribune, I guess you're okay."

"It is my term of endearment for them," I lied after an uncomfortably long pause. "I sometimes forget I am the only one who calls them that." I cringed at my own pathetic attempt at deceit. Only now did I realize why she called it a Degrumo. I needed an excuse now for why I changed my mind about buying whatever it is she's selling. "I'm afraid the price is a bit too steep."

"What are you talking about? Are you drunk?" She shouted in the phone. "Listen here, young man," she said after calming down a bit, "you know very well the price is symbolic. I don't need your damn money. I'll send it to you tomorrow morning."

"But, but â€¦"

"Look, it's a pure-bred, a direct descendant of Cerberus. You'll have it by tomorrow." She hung up.

What? It's a stupid dog she's selling? Good thing she didn't ask me for my address. By the time the old crow realizes, it'll be too late. Not that I would've given her my address anyway. Then I remembered **I** was the one who was supposed to prank her, not the other way around. I guess I'm not as good at pranks as I thought.

The next morning, about two hours before sunrise, way before my alarm sounded, someone knocked at my apartment door. I woke up, looked, but didn't see anybody. Cautiously, I opened the door. Before my door, there was a large cage. The cage was covered with some cloth. Something inside was starting to growl. I hurried and dragged the cage inside and took the cloth off. The most horrible creature was inside. A two-headed dog with additional snake heads dangling from random parts of its body.  Then I remembered my conversation with the old witch the other day. A Degrumo, descendant of Cerberus. I guess it resembles its ancestor. Only it's missing one head. Maybe not as pure-bred as the witch claimed.

It's been two days since I have the monster. I'm at least thankful, that it sleeps 20 hours a day. The 4 hours between midnight and 4 AM it spends hunting people on the street. It comes home in the morning with a human leg or arm. I tried to lock the fiend, but it always gets out. I tried to kill it, but it's incredibly tough, I guess supernaturally so.

So, my question is: Does anybody want a DEADLY GRUESOME MONSTER? Please DM me.

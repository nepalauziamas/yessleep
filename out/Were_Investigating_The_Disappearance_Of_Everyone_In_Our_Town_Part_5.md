&#x200B;

I swear if it's not one thing it's another. This week has been hectic, to say the least. I'll get to exactly why later on. The day after my last post, Stevenson decided to study the dagger. He informed us that he usually keeps some lab supplies in his car. Seeing as how it was wrecked by the card trees, we went with the next best thing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I don't have many fond memories of this place," Stevenson said, "or any for that matter."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We were parked in front of my old high school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Yeah, even with all the shit I had to deal with growing up, this place was still pretty boring," I replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Up close we could now see the front doors and several windows smashed in. This made me uneasy. It meant that kids, annoying though high schoolers may be, had been taken. Also, I know I'm not one to talk about how I behaved at that age, but I won't lie and say that some of them didn't have it coming back then. In general, annoyance tends to beget violence.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Maybe I spoke too soon," I said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To my surprise, the school seemed to have been updated since I graduated.  While I wouldn't call its equipment up to date, it certainly was an improvement when it wasn't smashed to bits anyway. It's weird how I was still able to remember where everything was even after being gone for so long. We headed for the science wing and into a classroom that didn't look too damaged. Stevenson found a microscope and plugged it into a portable outlet we brought with us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Find anything unusual?" Nick asked as Stevenson was peering through the ocular.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Incredible," he murmured, adjusting the knobs, "Usually, a solid object's cells are static, but this one's is kinetic. It's as if it somehow has the energy of a gas.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"So what does that mean?" I asked. "Can it help us?"

&#x200B;

"I'm not sure yet. Maybe we should perform some tests."

&#x200B;

"We could do it back home," Carl suggested.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We stepped out of the classroom. However, before we could leave there was something on the other side of the hall that caught our attention. It was a long chord. Upon closer examination, we realized that it was connected to the school's security cameras which were something else it didn't have when I was attending.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You people were spying on high schoolers?" Nick asked Stevenson in disgust. "That's sick."

&#x200B;

"It wasn't my idea," he defensively replied. "I just do research."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He did have a point. Then again he never told us he wasn't against the surveillance so we did as well. Regardless, it was an issue that could wait. Stevenson took the microscope from the classroom and then we left the school. Our next errand was checking the old book from the library.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Invisible ink from back then was fairly easy to read provided a light source was handy. Ours was a flashlight held underneath the pages. It turns out that the book held far more information than we realized. There were symbols similar to the ones we normally use and yet we didn't recognize them. It wasn't only those either, there were also illustrations of different creatures.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You know, it would have helped if the town's founders left a message to let us know this was in here," I said. "Something like " by the way, we also wrote with invisible ink" on the last page."

&#x200B;

"Maybe it was common knowledge back then so it became an oversight?" Carl shrugged.

&#x200B;

"What if they were trying to hide it?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We hadn't considered that.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You may be onto something," I told him. "The question is hiding it from who or what and why?"

&#x200B;

"One thing at a time," Carl said. "First, we need to see if the tree fuckers are in here. If they are, we'll finally know how to deal with them."

&#x200B;

"Right."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We continued scanning through the book while Stevenson worked in the basement. Eventually, we did find the card trees sketched in their pages.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Finally," Carl said, "now let's see theirâ€¦"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We stared at the page. Then we stared some more. When we collectively realized our eyes weren't deceiving us, I felt bubbling anger. It was the kind reserved when something is incredibly stupid.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You can't be serious," I blurted out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The page we were viewing with the card trees indeed had symbols by them and they were ones belonging to poker cards.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"The whole time?" Nick yelled, dumbfoundedly. "This was their weakness the whole time?"

&#x200B;

"You know, there are days when I feel like an idiot," Carl told us. "This is one of them."

&#x200B;

"Well, now that we've gotten that out of our systems," I said, "I think we should tell Stevenson."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did and he responded with a pungent smugness.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It's alright," he smirked. "We can all be a little slow at times."

&#x200B;

"Oh, whatever," Carl replied, rolling his eyes. "You never figured it out either.

&#x200B;

"You're right and that's because my mind was focused on more, how should I put this?" Advanced matters."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn't hard to see why Stevenson got bullied in school. People like him think it happens because they are smart which makes others feel threatened. While that's certainly the case in some instances, his was probably due to the fact he was a condescending asshole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Nonetheless," he continued, "I suppose we all need help every once in a while."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

An angered Carl stepped forward, but Nick put an arm in front of his chest, looked at him, and shook his head. Carl cooled down and I turned back to Stevenson.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Okay, so can you make something of this?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I handed him the book, opening it to the right pages.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I should be able to implement them into my current project," he replied, glancing down at them. "Give me some time. I should be finished before dusk."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We passed the time by playing some Halo 2 on Carl's old 360. As I was about to get a winning kill with the needler, Stevenson came back into our room and called our attention which momentarily distracted me and allowed Carl to get the winning kills on me and Nick instead.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Damn it, Carl. That's not fair," I said as we gave him light glares.

&#x200B;

"Gotta keep your eyes on the prize," he told us. "Now, what do you want?"

&#x200B;

Carl looked at Stevenson.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"It's done."

&#x200B;

"Really? Well, let's see it."

&#x200B;

"Follow me then."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It wasn't only one weapon. There were several. There was a rotating chamber with a label showing the card suits on it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"How does it work?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

"Simple, whatever you spin the label to will be stamped onto the bullet you're firing. Why don't we test them out?"

&#x200B;

"Hang on," I interjected, "this is only for self-defense. We're not looking to just slaughter them."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Stevenson shrugged.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"They'll serve us well in either case, but I do think right now we need to capture one."

&#x200B;

"I'm sorry," Carl said. "Did you say capture?"

&#x200B;

"If I can examine one up close it may give us some insight as to what they did with everyone."

&#x200B;

"Can we even fit one in here?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

"Maybe if we trim them down a bit," I replied.

&#x200B;

"Right, then let's catch a card tree," Carl replied.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We needed to make some additional preparations. Namely, we made some drug-tipped arrows with suits carved onto them. Honestly, we weren't even sure if they would work. The hope was that if they could bleed then they would. In addition to that, we also painted the suits on some chains and Carl's house.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Everyone ready?" Carl asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Armed with crossbows and Stevenson's guns, we replied that we were.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'll be staying inside thank you," Stevenson replied.

&#x200B;

"Great, there goes our decoy," Nick said to which he received a glare.

&#x200B;

"Just get the damn specimen."

&#x200B;

"You got it, professor."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We left.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That's doctor," Stevenson called after us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Outside now, the sky was a vibrant pink in the last minutes of daylight. Despite the horrific abominations of nature, we were about to face, we did find the sight quite beautiful. That changed when we could see the first of them moving in the woods.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Get ready," Carl told us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

He got his bow out along with four arrows of different suits. We did the same and waited. The card tree that came into view was a club. We loaded our crossbows and fired. The arrows hit their mark, resulting in a pained moan from the card tree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"At least we know our weapons work on them now, " he said.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, but is it slowing down?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The card tree came closer and that indeed seemed to be the case. This would have been great if it weren't for the fact the drugs weren't stopping it fast enough. I cursed, ducking when it tried to grab me.

&#x200B;

"Fucking shoot it," I yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It grabbed me by the waist, lifting me off the ground. I was about to pull out a knife and stab it when it spoke. That's right. It actually talked and this time I know I didn't imagine it.

&#x200B;

"Pleaseâ€¦" it whispered. "Free us."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My heartbeat became none existent and time stopped. My mind was racing with a million thoughts that were interrupted by Carl and Nick firing more arrows. It dropped me and I shook off my fatigue.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Don't get distracted, Pete," Carl said.

&#x200B;

"Yeah, sorry," I called back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

At last, the drugs were finally taking effect. A couple more shots and the card tree's movements were growing steadily more sluggish. It came to a stop and began to fall over.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Timber," Nick said.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It hit the ground and we rushed over, wrapping it in chains.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Alright, let's get it inside before more show up," Carl told us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The ground rumbled. Off in the distance, a forest of card trees were moving in our direction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Uh oh," Nick exclaimed and got his gun out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did as well. Then an icy realization washed over me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Guys," I said, "They're running away from something."

&#x200B;

"What could possibly make themâ€¦?" Carl asked and then his eyes got an expression of recollection.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"That thing Stevenson mentioned," Nick said with wide eyes, finishing our thoughts for us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Out into the clearing came a [deer.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/vvjyd5/a_cryptid_killed_my_exbest_friend_finale/) It didn't have sharp teeth. It wasn't walking on two legs. It didn't even have big antlers. It seemed perfectly ordinary which is why we shot it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Yeah, with all the shit we've faced and especially with what we've been dealing with lately, a deer appearing is so normal it becomes unnerving. Sure enough, we were right. The deer began chuckling. Many people don't know this, but they do make a noise and it's how this thing sounded when it talked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Smart prey, huh? That's an exciting change of pace."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was being all weird cryptid deer now that its faÃ§ade had been exposed or in this case, shot off.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"You got about ten seconds to explain what and who the fuck you are before we blast your ass into shredded venison," Carl told the creature as our guns were still pointing firmly at it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The deer sat up and its lips curved upward and parted, revealing several layers of human-esque teeth.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"All you need to know is I'm the apex predator."

&#x200B;

"Did Indefermast send you?" I asked.

&#x200B;

"Never heard of them. I'm here because my last home was destroyed."

&#x200B;

"By what?"

&#x200B;

"Just two people who were upset I killed someone they knew."

&#x200B;

"And what did you do to them?"

&#x200B;

"Ate them right up. They tasted good."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anger and worry flowed into me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Did you do that to anyone here?" I yelled.

&#x200B;

"Only the moving trees. Now, you three are next."

&#x200B;

"Don't think so," Carl growled and we fired again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

By the time we were done, what was left was a deer-shaped thing giving its best impersonation of swiss cheese.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Do you think that was overkill?" Nick asked.

&#x200B;

"Speak up," I replied. "My ears are still ringing."

&#x200B;

"Guys," Carl hoarsely whispered.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Upon seeing what was making him lose his voice, our throats went dry. In addition to its wounds having healed as if we never riddled it with bullets, the deer was now changing. The bending and snapping of shifting bones was bad enough. What was much worse was what or rather who it chose to take the shape of.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"What, " Nick said.

&#x200B;

"In the" Carl added.

&#x200B;

"Fuck?" I finished.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It had my face except that its antlers, eyes, and teeth were the same. It stood on hooved back legs with its torso resembling mine. I could at least take comfort in the fact with our ranged weapons we were at the advantage. Suddenly, sharpened vine-like tentacles protruded from its back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If there's anything I've learned, it's that if you give the universe a chance to fuck with you, it will. A storm of curses filled my head at the horrid sight before us. I was going to say without warning, its tentacles shot forward. However, now that I think about it, this is a stupid phrase. I mean, what's the alternative, a shape-shifting monster hungry for human flesh politely letting us know in advance that it's about to launch an attack?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I digress. Anyway, it was fast and this is where our training was finally coming into good use. With our heightened reflexes, we were able to dodge it and I felt a sharp end graze past me.  We noticed that it was reaching for something. To our dismay, it grabbed the chained-up card tree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Duck," Carl barked as the creature yanked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We did so, even feeling the wind of the card tree passing over us. It caught it and was now holding it as if it were a club. We had firepower, sure. The problem was while the monster could be put down, it didn't stay down. I should mention I also have come to realize that the phrase "words can't describe" has always seemed cheap to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

With that being said, though, it is legitimately difficult to convey how terrifying it is seeing something that freaky wearing your face, especially when it starts getting all jittery movement on you. It tried assaulting us with a series of whipping attacks which we managed to evade by ducking, sidestepping, and even dodge rolling. Honestly, it was extremely exhilarating to pull that off outside of training. Unfortunately, we knew we could only keep it up for so long and so did the monster. Carl fired off a shot at its face and we dove behind a tree while it was regenerating.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Maybe we should consider some kind of exit strategy," I panted.

&#x200B;

"Yeah," Carl replied. "Let's cut throughâ€¦"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a noise akin to slicing the air with a knife. Then the entire trunk of the tree right above our heads toppled over. My heart stopped when that happened. The shapeshifter stared at us, its grin stretching wider. The card tree it held was now stirring it and was as scared as us.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Then we noticed something disturbing. Its tentacles were burrowing into the soil. Instinctively, we jumped back right as they sprang up from the ground. Knowing that I nearly got pierced from the chin up to my brain isn't what I would call a comforting thought. If that wasn't bad enough, it turned out that was merely a distraction.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Its grotesque limbs wrapped around our arms, lifting us up. We cursed as our guns slipped from our grasp. We struggled while getting whipped around like rag dolls, making my insides do cartwheels. I'm not sure what was worse, the headache-inducing double vision or the intense nausea. Actually, it was probably the fact a shapeshifting monstrosity was about to bite my head off.

&#x200B;

It brought me close, only inches from my face.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"I'll start with you," it said as Carl and Nick were screaming my name.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Panicked filled my mind as I tried desperately to get free. I managed to slip my hand into a pocket and grasp something. Instantly, I realized what it was and yanked it out. The blade of the living knife sliced through the creature's arms like butter, making it shriek. This wasn't just it toying with us either.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It was in genuine and from the sound of it, agonizing pain. I dropped, landing on my feet. Before it could regain its composure, I went berserk, stabbing it repeatedly. Each time, I twisted the handle to yank the blade out. It let out an enraged roar and backhanded me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I flew back a few yards and landed on my back. Groaning, and rubbing my jaw, I shook off the pain and fatigue in time to hear Nick.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Pete, look out," he yelled.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My eyes went wide as the card tree it was using came down like a hammer. I rolled out of the way, causing it to strike the ground right beside me. That would've been one hell of a headache. As it was getting ready to try again, an arrow went into its right eye. It staggered back, screaming.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Pete," Carl called out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I turned to see him holding my gun. He tossed it and I caught it by the handle. Focusing back on the monster, I could see its wounds were no longer healing and deduced the knife was the cause. The handle of which was protruding from its chest. We advanced on it, firing rapidly.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Although it was taking a lot of damage, we couldn't seem to kill it. This thing's durability was insane. Despite this, we pressed on. My stomach dropped when pulling our triggers only met with clicks. The shapeshifter, now extremely pissed off, swung the card tree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We tried to dodge and found one of its limbs around our ankles. It knocked us away like it was a game of t-ball. We flew toward the house and crashed down in front of Carl's fence. There were no words from the creature. It clearly wasn't used to being in this kind of situation and it wanted blood.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It pulled the dagger from its chest and shattered it with one hand, throwing the now blameless handle on the ground. My heart twisted when I saw this. I didn't have time to mope, though since it was about to rip us apart.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"We need to hit it with something big," Carl told us as it was coming closer.

&#x200B;

"What else do we have, some grenades?" Nick asked him.

&#x200B;

"Maybe in the house if you guys can hold it off."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The problem was we couldn't get up. I guess getting hit with something that size will do that to you. The shapeshifter was nearly on us and we struggled feebly to stand up. Now it was grinning again. It knew we were flies caught in its web.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Feeding time," it rasped and took another step like a lion ready to pounce.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

For whatever reason, something clicked in my head, a memory.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Hang on, Carl," I said, "didn't you bury some land mi-?"

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The ensuing explosion sent parts of its body shooting in all directions. The clearing smoke revealed something falling from the sky and then the shapeshifter's smoldering head hit the ground, rolling, and came to a stop at my feet.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Huh," Carl said, "so that's why nobody else came here while we were gone."

&#x200B;

"What about the others?" Nick asked, concerned.

&#x200B;

"I guess the other creatures set them off."

&#x200B;

"You guess?"

&#x200B;

"Where's the card tree?" I asked.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We looked around and saw it face down in the dirt.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

"Come on," I said, "we better get it in before the others come back."

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Well, that was a crazy night. We managed to get the card tree down to the basement and Stevenson is experimenting on it. When he saw the shapeshifter, he panicked and hid in the closet, only coming out when we came inside. We don't know what exactly he's doing to it, but he tells us it's necessary. I hope it isn't anything too bad.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Speaking of, it's a damn shame about the knife. There's nothing I can do about it now, though. I was able to pick up the handle along with its shards so at least we have that and the feeling is still there, albeit faint. We also have the monster's skull. It's a kind of blackish green with multiple sockets and antlers sticking out. I may have an idea of what to do with it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

However, I need some candles. In the meantime, it's off to bed for me. After tonight, I'm in serious need of some [rest.](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) Later, [everyone.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

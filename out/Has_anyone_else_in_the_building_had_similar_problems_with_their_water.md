Hi, my name is Sasha and I just moved here with my boyfriend Jason. We're both new to the city and we just moved into our new apartment near the end of church street. We were excited to start our new life here, and love the area! The eating is great and everyone seems to be friendly. Though, after about two weeks now we've been having problems with our water.

The first thing that happened was our water started to turn black and I swear, thicker.  I don't know if it's because the water heater is old or the pipes are rusted and slimy, but it started to really bother me.  I researched common issues why this would happen and turns out magnesium is often found in water and when mixed with oxygen, turns black. Jason says I'm overthinking it, but I just can't help myself. He only drinks from a store-bought gallon jug of water. He won't even touch the filtered tap. He says the water is fine and doesn't see anything wrong with it.

I have to visit my coworker's place down the hall to shower.  I feel icky using the water here and I'm too embarrassed to tell Jason. He'd make fun of me for sure if he knew how much this was affecting me. I've been having nightmares about it. I'm sure it is because of all the stress about moving plus all of what is happening. In my dreams, there's this murky black liquid trying to overwhelm me. It almost feels like drowning, but not really. It is hard to describe. It feels more like a struggle. It wants to dominate me, as it fills my lungs, it lets me breathe. But once I catch my breath it takes it away until I willingly let go. It won't stop until it is my choice to give in. I fight it and wake up in a pool of sweat.

I've tried to tell Jason about my dreams, but he just laughs it off and tells me I'm overthinking things again. That I'm just stressed out because of the move. I want to believe him, I really do. But there's something about the water here that feels off. Like it's poisoned or cursed. Just typing that feels like I'm losing it.

I went down to visit my neighbor, Mrs. Janice three doors down and she was telling me how her son had the same problem with his water a few years back. She even showed me some pictures of what it looked like. I had her send me a copy of the photo so I could show Jason.  Maybe if he saw it with his own eyes, he would believe me.

When I got back to our apartment, Jason was in the kitchen cooking dinner and I showed him the picture. He just brushed it off and said that the water looked fine to him and to stop acting foolish. I couldn't believe he was being so dismissive! I started getting really mad and started yelling at him. I accused him of not believing me and not caring about my feelings. He just stood there and took it until I stopped and then calmly asked me what was going on.  I told him I didn't know, but that I just couldn't shake this feeling that something was wrong.

He finally agreed to call maintenance and have them come take a look at our water. Maybe there was something wrong with it after all. The maintenance man came by the next day and checked things out, but said everything looked fine to him. He did say that we might want to get our water tested just in case though. Jason assured him we would do that and thanked him for his time.

I asked Jason if he would please take me to get a water test done. I told him about the nightmares and how stressed out I've been feeling. He finally realized how serious this was for me and promised.  We went to the store and got a test kit and everything came back normal. Jason was so relieved and kept telling me I was overthinking things. I wanted to believe him, I really did. But I just couldn't shake this feeling that something was wrong.

A few days later, I woke up early morning and found the water so dark pooling in my bathroom sink that the light above didn't even reflect off the surface of the water. I was so startled that when I went to grab my phone to take a picture I dropped my phone in the water.  I quickly fished it out and was able to take the picture.

I'm sorry for the quality I had just dropped it in, what I think is liquid. I had the light on I swear. It looks like water has gotten into my lens.

After work, I showed Jason the same picture I just showed you. He said that the sink is empty. I'm so tired, I can't think straight. I haven't been sleeping because of my dreams. What's happening to me? Is the water really not there? Or am I just going crazy?  Jason and I got into another fight and he is staying at his friend's place for a couple of days.

Edit:

It has been a couple of days and I feel like I'm losing my mind. I've been calling out sick at work and Jason still hasn't come home and I'm alone. I've been sitting in the bathroom staring at the sink for hours now. Just waiting for something to happen.

I'm so thirsty. I haven't drunk anything, really, since this, all started. Maybe if I drink some water, it will help me feel better. Maybe the water is normal after all. Maybe I'm just overthinking things like Jason keeps telling me. Maybe he will come home after I just get over whatever this is and we can go back to how things were.

I'm going to drink some of the water now. I hope it will help me feel better. I took another picture before drinking from the glass. It is black. Light won't even pass through it when I hold it up to the ceiling light in the kitchen. I'm sorry again, about the dark photo. Not really much to see other than,  it.

I feel so dizzy. I don't know what's happening to me. The water tasted so strange. I think I'm going to vomit. I'm going to take sleeping meds after my stomach settles. Thank you to everyone who has helped me. I don't know what to do next. I just need to get some rest. I'm so exhausted. I hope I can forget all about this and get some rest.

Edit:

I keep seeing the water in my dreams. I woke up sweaty again. I'm going to take a shower. I need to get over this.

Edit:

The water was so cold and dark. It feels like I can't breathe. I can't think. I can't feel it. I'm so tired.  I just want to sleep.

Edit:

I'm so thirsty. I feel like I'm going to die. I need water.

Edit:

I'm so tired. I can't keep my eyes open. I'm going to drink some more water.

Edit:

I feel like I'm losing my mind. I see the water everywhere I go. It's surrounding me. I think I'm going to let it. I'm so tired. I just want to be done.

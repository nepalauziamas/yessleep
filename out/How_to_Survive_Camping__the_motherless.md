I run a private campground.  Over a year ago I started telling you all about my little patch of field and forest and the creatures that live on it - and how to survive them.  I did not spare the details, which led to a fair number of you going, wow Kate, you’re kind of a monster yourself.  I justified it by telling myself that when you’re [dealing with flesh-eating horses](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kj9fai/how_to_survive_horses/) and other monstrosities, you have to be a bit ruthless.

Then a year ago, [Perchta showed up](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/eirxb4/how_to_survive_camping_something_worse_than_coal/) and gave me a warning that made me reconsider my position.  I keep the bloody piece of thread on my dresser as a reminder.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this might help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

While today is not her feast day, Beau warned me that the seamstress of slaughter was drawing close.  He felt her presence.  Like a storm on the horizon.  I suppose it makes sense that she can show up whenever she feels like it.  I don’t follow her tenets.  I don’t weave.  My family ancestry is a muddled mess and we don’t keep the traditions of any one culture.  Perchta has no traditional claim on me.  Her appearance last year was a special interest she showed for… reasons, I guess.

Perhaps she makes exceptions for people she particularly takes issue with.  I suppose it’s pointless to wonder why I’ve been singled out when I’m sure there’s much worse people to go after, like insurance company executives.  (if you’re reading this and have the chance to maybe book an executive retreat for said insurance companies, I’ll offer a *substantial* discount for use of my campground, just saying)

But these creatures do what they will.  Perhaps I merited special attention because my land was in the early throes of turning ancient and the decision of who it will go to is of great importance to more than just people that like to go camping.

I waited for Perchta’s arrival in my living room.  My tarot deck was sitting out on the coffee table for no other reason than it felt appropriate.  I wasn’t trying to do any readings.  It hadn’t been very effective last year.  I feel it was trying to tell me something, but my mind is so preoccupied with the here and now that I don’t have space in my brain for these nebulous ‘what-ifs?’

But honestly, at that moment, my mind was mostly occupied with dread.  I can’t undo the past.  People died on my land this past year and that cannot be changed.  My theory that Perchta was asking for a specific outcome at some point in the future rather than a general “don’t let people die” could very well have been nothing but wishful thinking.  There was no avoiding my fate.  I could only wait to find out if Perchta took offense at my actions or not.

I think I dozed off a bit on the sofa, for I next remember being startled awake by the front door banging open.  It brought with it a hefty gust of cold air that sank its teeth into my ears and fingers.  I fear January is going to be *brutal* if the temperature continues to fall like this.

Framed in the doorway stood Perchta.  She was dressed in a radiant, white gossamer dress with no sleeves.  It billowed at her feet like drifts of snow.  In one hand she held a needle, already threaded.

I eyed it nervously.  Granted, it wasn’t a plough and chain that she used on *particularly* wicked individuals, but disemboweling is disemboweling, regardless of how you’re sewn back up.

“I, uh, made tea,” I offered.

She stepped inside, her expression composed and her steps deliberate.  Making a point.  She did not have to be invited inside.  She was an ancient thing and could go as she willed.

“That would be *lovely*,” she hissed.

So I went to the kitchen where there was already a carafe from earlier in the evening and when I came back with two mugs she was seated on my sofa and was sewing up a rip in one of my jackets.  I don’t remember quite what caused the tear, it was either while clearing out dead branches or fleeing from the fomorian.  You know.  Just campground things.  I set the tea down in front of her and perched on the edge of a chair, too nervous to actually settle down.

“You act like you’re ready to flee at any moment,” Perchta commented, not taking her eyes off her work.

“I *am*,” I laughed nervously.  “Did you come to just mend my jacket or is that thread also meant for me?”

“You tell me.”

“I’m trying.  I really am.”

“You don’t sound convinced.”

Her eyes flickered up from her work to regard me.  I took a deep breath and tried to summon any conviction I had in my heart.  Wasn’t I doing better?  Wasn’t I trying to not take the easy way out, no matter how seductively it whispered to me?

“Because I’m frightened,” I said, my sudden honesty surprising even me.  “I don’t want to die - and yet - that’s the only way I read this situation.  You said I could save everyone and with the land turning ancient… I think that means I need to let some benevolent creature take my life and entrust the land to its protection.”

Perchta said nothing.  She only continued to sew and I waited until she was done.  She knotted the thread with a few deft motions of the needle and broke the strands with her teeth.  Then she set the jacket aside and granted me her full attention.  Still, she did not speak.  The question of my character was for me alone to answer.

“I want to do what you told me,” I said desperately.  “Why do I have to die though?”

“You should know the power in sacrifice.  It’s only right, isn’t it?  After all these generations of sacrificing others to this land, now the debt falls to you.”

“We didn’t sacrifice people.”

“Didn’t you?”

She leaned forwards and slipped a card out of the tarot deck that sat on the table.  Justice.  She held it up for me to see, a silent condemnation of my family’s blood history.  Me and my damn rules.  Perhaps they saved some, but they also served to absolve me of responsibility.  What’s fair is fair, after all.  They were warned.

I suppose that didn’t make it right.

“Am I… at least on the right track?”

“This would not be a civil conversation if you were not.”

I laughed, a brief bout of hysteria induced by how close I’d been sitting to a gorey demise and the relief of release.  She wasn’t here to kill me.  I didn’t have to save everyone starting with the instant she stabbed her needle through my flesh.  At some point in the future, I had to make the right choice, and in the meantime keep the land from falling into the wrong hands.  It all sounds so simple, doesn’t it?

Still.  My conversation with Perchta wasn’t over.  There was something I needed from her.

“You wouldn’t have come here just to inform me I get a reprieve,” I said.  “You’d have just… not shown at all.”

“And you wouldn’t have invited me for tea if you weren’t preparing to ask something of me.”

I’m not sure what it says about me that the person that truly seems to *get* me and my nervous habits is someone who runs around replacing people’s entrails with straw and rocks.

I stood and went to the guest bedroom, which used to be my room when I was a child.  I returned with a couple bags of children’s shoes and toys.  Gifts from the gofundme.  Y'all are so clever.

“These are gifts for your children,” I said, setting them at her feet.  She merely regarded me placidly, her hands crossed over her needle and thread.

“I have none with me.”

“There are some on this campground in want of a mother.”

If this past year has taught me anything, it’s that the best way to get rid of something inhuman is to sic an even bigger and nastier inhuman thing on it.  Perchta was silent and still for a moment, then she demurely closed her eyes and gestured, beckoning me to come closer.  I complied, my heart beating rapidly in my chest.  She took my right hand with her left and then held her needle up between us.  Then she made a stitch.  A careful incision on the tip of my finger, where the skin is calloused and she could run the needle through without drawing blood.  It was a strange and unpleasant sensation, having thread drawn through the tip of my finger like that, but it didn’t hurt.  She put another stitch in my next finger, and so on and so on, until white thread ran loosely between each fingertip of my hand.  Then she took the left and did the same, all with the same long, continuous piece of thread.  She hummed as she worked and did not open her eyes until it was done.  Then she bid me to break the thread myself with my teeth.  I stared at my hands and the threads connecting finger to finger, hand to hand.

“There,” she said.  “All done.  Now go bring me my children.”

I began to walk to the garage, but Perchta stopped me by speaking.

“You can use the front door,” she said slyly.  “The little girl will respect you as my envoy tonight.”

An envoy of Perchta.  Certainly something that not just anyone can put on their resume.

The little girl was standing in the yard, watching, as I left through the front door.  She wasn’t crying.  Her eyes were wide and she watched in silence as I walked to the gate.  On impulse, I turned to her.

“I’m not… making a mistake, am I?” I asked.

I didn’t expect a response.  It’s just this year has been so messed up and weird that I didn’t want to rule it out, either.  The little girl stared back at me for a moment and then slowly - very slowly - shook her head no.  I was not making a mistake.

Beau told me that the way to avoid the children was to stay off the roads.  That meant the way to find them was to stay *on* the roads.  I nervously walked along, wishing I’d thought to grab more than just my jacket.  A hat or scarf, maybe.  I certainly couldn’t wear gloves and I didn’t want to shove my hands in my pockets lest I break the threads.  My fingers began to ache and I was only mostly certain it was from the cold.  I wasn’t sure what the threads were for or what I was supposed to do with them.  I could only hope that, like most of these inhuman things, it would become apparent at the point it was needed.

I’d just entered the deep woods when I saw a figure standing on the road up ahead.  I could not see them clearly because a night mist was encroaching on the campground, rolling in and pouring into the low parts of the land.  It hovered silver over the snow.  I approached warily, gauging the size of the person before me.  Small.  A child.  I took a deep breath and regretted it, for the cold chewed at my lungs.

The child was alone.  She was small and dirty, standing barefoot in the packed snow on the dirt road.  I looked around, trying to make sure her peers weren’t lurking in ambush nearby.  There were no footprints to betray them.  For that matter, she didn’t leave any footprints either.

“You’re looking for us,” the child said to me.

Her voice seemed wrong.  It was too solemn for a child.

“I’ve found a mother for you,” I replied, stopping just a few feet away.

“My mother wasn’t here when I needed her.”

“This one is different.  I promise.”

I held out my hand, the threads glowing like the moonlight.  The child looked askance at them, considering.  Then, slowly, tentatively, she put her hand in mine.  Something flashed through my field of vision.  A child.  A mother.  A frozen lake.

“You drowned,” I gasped, when the visions cleared.  My chest ached, as if I’d been the one thrashing in the darkness and the cold, alone and afraid.

“I cried for my mother,” she whispered, “and she never came.  The water filled my lungs instead.”

I told her it was okay.  I’d take her to her new mother and this one would always be there.  I squeezed her hand tight.

One of the threads loosened from my finger.  It wrapped around her wrist.  And on we walked, through the woods as the mist steadily grew thicker.

The next child was a boy.  He died as a teenager.  I saw how his mother wasn’t ever really there for him, not even as she sat at his hospital bedside as he died after the car crash.  I was a little puzzled by this, for he wasn’t a child necessarily, and as the thread looped it around his wrist he appeared to me as he did in the moment he died, a teenager with a broken face and blood-stained eyes.  But he came with me.  As did the next.  And the next.  And finally, at the last, I understood.

A girl.  I saw her life, I saw her bury her mother at a younger age than I buried mine.  I saw her with children of her own and I saw them grow up and leave.  Then I saw her die, quietly in her sleep.  She never woke, only stirred slightly to call out, her lips barely moving, and then she was gone.

I was so certain that these were the souls of unbaptized children.  But my theories are only theories.  Sometimes I’m wrong.

Perhaps at one point dying before baptism is all that could give rise to these lost children, but the world has changed.  *We’ve* changed.  And our collective fears and hopes and needs have shifted, moving from the fear of an early death or starvation to the more nebulous fears of loneliness and emptiness.

As I watched the old woman, crying out softly in her sleep, I finally understood what the children were.

The souls of those that died alone, wanting for a mother, and being denied that gentle comfort of a hand to hold in their last moments.

I took her hand and promised to take her to someone that would make sure she was never alone again.  She gazed up at me with hopeful eyes as a thread wrapped itself around her wrist.

The task was done.  I’d collected all the children and I still had a few strands to spare.  Satisfied, I turned to return to the house where Perchta waited for us.  It was then that I realized I could no longer see the road.  In fact, I couldn’t see anything of the campground at all.  For a moment I panicked, thinking perhaps I was in the gray world, but there were no trees and no sky, leeched of color.  Just the mist.

Sometimes, roads will lead you somewhere other than where you intended to go.

There was movement in the fog.  I squinted, trying to discern shapes out of the shifting haze.  With a start, I realized what it was.  Children.  Rows and rows of children, all pulling at each other, struggling to get ahead in the surging press of bodies.  Their eyes were wide with desperation, a hopeless yearning not out of hunger or malice, but a simple primal need to not be left behind.  To not be left alone in this in-between world.  There were so many.  The tide of bodies vanished into the mist but I knew they were there, an endless mass of lost souls that all cried out for the same thing.  They stretched out fingers in my direction as they pleaded.

Mother.  I want my mother.

And I only had two strings left.

“We’re going to play a game, children,” I said frantically to the ones I’d already bound.  “It’s called ‘run like hell from the undead horde.’”

I ran.  And it was like the children - and adults - yoked to me were nothing more than wisps of wind.  They trailed behind me, almost formless, bound only to this reality by the threads around their wrists.  I dragged them along in my wake, binding them to my humanity, and carried them out of this half-realm of the lonesome dead.

There was a light up ahead.  The light of my front porch.  The only beacon I had.  I ran for it as the horde closed in around me, hands reaching out of the mist to snatch at my jacket.  They screamed at me to take them with me.  To not leave them alone.  But most of all, they cried out for their mothers.

“I’m sorry!” I cried out.  “There’s too many of you!”

I stretched out my hand for the light of my front porch.  Cold hands closed on my legs, seizing the hem of my jeans.  The dead sobbed, trying to drag me back in their desperate loneliness.  So unwilling to be left alone in their moment of need once again that they were willing to consign another to the same fate.  I felt my fingers touch a doorknob and then I was falling forwards, tumbling into the warmth and light of my entryway.

Panting, I whirled around.  The children were gone.  The mist was gone.  There was only my front yard and the little girl, watching, just as she’d been when I’d left.  I slowly closed the door, staring at the threads still attached to my fingers.

“Did I… fail?” I asked, not turning around, fearing the answer.  “Did I not run fast enough?”

The children I’d had with me were nowhere to be seen.

“No.  Come here.”

She snipped the threads from my fingers, one by one, and tucked them away into some invisible pocket.  As she worked, I noticed that the toys and shoes were gone.  I also noticed that her shears were stained with layers of blood, but I tried not to focus on that too much.

“Thank you for collecting them for me,” she said.  “If more find your way to the campground, I’ll come for them as well.”

“There were… countless souls.  Are they all trapped there until someone claims them?”

She tilted her head at me as if I’d asked a strange question.

“Not all are trapped,” she said.  “Nor are all of them souls.  Some are… echoes.  You shouldn’t bother with such things.  It is beyond your domain.”

Life advice from Perchta.  Don’t worry about the dead, for there’s nothing we can do for them.  It’s cold comfort.  I half-listened as Perchta told me that she’d take the children with her and she’d set them loose on the night of her wild hunt.  I wondered if the children would ride a wagon, in amongst the hordes of her followers, screeching as they raced through the night and chased down anything unfortunate enough to be caught in their path.  Then she said something that brought my full attention back to her.

“You belong with my hunt,” Perchta said thoughtfully.  “Granted, you’re currently alive, but your death is written in your family’s blood.  What’s a handful of years matter?  One?  Ten?  Come with me, Kate, and I’ll give you the mother you still yearn for.”

I looked up at her.  Her appearance had changed.  She wore boots.  Her gossamer dress was gone, replaced by practical jeans and a flannel plaid shirt I knew too well.  I knew what it smelled like.

It was my mother’s favorite.

And Perchta wore my mother’s face.  Her hair.  The steely look in her eyes, glinting like fire.

“You cry out for you, do you not?” she continued.  “I hear it in your heart.”

“Everyone dies,” I said through clenched teeth.  I stepped backwards towards the door.  “I will learn to live with this.”

“You don’t *have* to.”

She reached out for me with my mother’s hand.

I watched her die, all those years ago.  In my dream, far away in my bed in my college apartment.  It was a true dream.  The little girl sat on her bed, her hands stained with my mother’s blood, and her abdomen was split open and the organs inside strewn about and packed back in carelessly, like a child assembling bricks.

Now Perchta stood here, hand outstretched, coming to claim me as one of her own lost children.  To run in her wild hunt, to be lost forever to this world and belong to the other.

I think… I went a little mad at that point.  I ran.  Straight out the front door, heedless of the little girl or my own safety.  I stumbled down the front steps and the little girl hurried forwards, but it wasn’t for me.  She stepped behind me, standing between me and Perchta, and I didn’t dare stop and watch.  I could barely see, anyway, for the tears in my eyes.  I burst through the gate and out to the road and I ran to the only place I could think of.

I ran to the graveyard.  I collapsed in front of my mother’s grave.  And I screamed my grief to the cold earth, weeping for a mother that was gone and could not be replaced.

I was there for a long time.  Finally, a voice made me come back to myself.  The little girl.  I didn’t turn around.  She wasn’t close by.  She’d never crossed into the graveyard before, to my knowledge.

“She’s gone,” the little girl said.  “I don’t think she’ll be back until next year.”

“She didn’t try to take you?” I sniffled.

“I have no mother, for I was never born.”

She’s not a ghost.  She was never a human to begin with.  She’s something fully inhuman, created specifically as my family’s curse.  For a moment, I was stunned at this revelation, and my mind whirled with all the questions it created.  How does such a thing happen?  What *is* my family’s relationship with this land?

I asked where she came from, then, if not a mother.  The little girl didn’t answer.  I twisted where I knelt and turned around to look.

Above me loomed the beast and in its jaws was the little girl’s body, slack and silent.  Its teeth were like spikes carved from obsidian, its multitude of eyes shone like stars, and it consumed the sky above me so that all I could see was its hide, carved from the waning night itself.  I could feel the heat of its throat and the weight of its breath upon me.

My death, staring down upon me, mere feet away.

It was like the world spun.  I felt like a feather, buffeted by a storm, my body weightless, and then knew nothing more.

I awoke to find myself alone in the graveyard.  The sun was over the horizon.  And embarrassingly, my jeans were wet.  If I have to surmise what happened… I pissed myself and fainted.

So… yeah.  That’s a thing that happened.

Look - I’m a campground manager.  I’ve dealt with a lot of shit over the years but I fear the beast like I fear no other.  At least it was sated by the little girl.  At least I’m still here.

This world is a cruel place.  It takes our fears and turns them against us.  These things that we dread, that we try not to think about but haunt us nonetheless, in the silent spaces of our mind, are plucked clear and given form and life.  They are turned into weapons, into monsters, and into curses.  This world shackles us with the things we seek to flee.

I have no comfort to give you.  How can I tell you to come to terms with your loneliness, with your loss, when I can’t do so myself?

Perchta was right.  I miss my mother.  [I miss both my parents.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/kpdju6/how_to_survive_camping_rule_13_the_last_rule/)  I want them back more than anything.  And I fear death because I know it will be by the hand of some inhuman thing and by that nature, I will be alone when I die. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

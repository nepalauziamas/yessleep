It was summer vacations when me and my best friend decided to create a fake account of a girl to fool some boys around and spend our vacations well with that.

So we started messaging guys who we know would get fooled easily but thats not what happened. They immediately came to know that they are being tried to get tricked. Almost none of the guys fall into our trap and eventually we had to deactivate the account. If I ever had known about the fact that this is gonna be the biggest mistake I have ever done, we would have never created that account.

After the vacations, schools were started as usual and all the boring stuff. I suddenly remembered about the account we created in holidays and asked my friend lets try this out again one last time. We started messaging random guys now. There was a popular girl in our school time and she wasnt on instagram so we took advantage of that and named the account after her name. 

One of her close friends got to know about the account and messaged the girl (which was us) and we started talking all the shit. 

I dont know how he came to know that the account was fake and it was handled by me. The next day he came to my school and started to hit me badly and asked me are you fooling me or what. He was also one of my good friends at school times.

After that a very shitty thing happened which I am still not able to figure out, my real insta handle was taken over by some other guy who knew about all that happened previously. He started cursing random people from my id and I was speechless and helpless that how the fuck is this happening.

And eventually those random guys who recieved curses from my real id got to my school to beat the shit outta me. I tried so hard to explain those guys that these msgs were not sent by me and someone took my account, but that was of no use. They started kicking me everywhere wherever possible and I felt helpless. 

My ego is very fragile and as a result I decided to take revenge. My best friend also came to know that I got beaten up at the school and he was out of his mind. We literally created a list of people who were involved in beating me and were gonna pick every guy one by one. The next the my best friend got like 10 guys with him at my school and we went to take revenge to every guys house. Those 10 guys were so hopeless and careless they literally hit that guy with a footpath block in his head and he got severely injured. I got so afraid that I decided to run from the mess. I just wanted to return the kicks he blowed at me at that time and never wished to injure him that badly. Everything got caugth up in a cctv and my parents were called up by the principal. The principal was about to make a police complaint against me but luckily the parents of the injured guy were so kind they denied for the police complaint as it was their son who used violence against me at the first place.

My parents were so mad at me. My mother literally decided to stop my schooling. 

This was a nightmare experience for me and I started to have suicidal thoughts. And the most embarrasing thing about this incident is that my relatives had came over to my house to spend vacations and everything hapenned in front of their eyes lol. Imagine yourself getting into this situation and at the same time your relatives are also present their watching you getting beaten up by your parents, yes, my parents also hit me.

Current status about me and my best friend's relation just breaks my heart even today. We are no more friends anymore. The reason behind this was very precise. The principal sayed that I would spare you only on one condition and that was calling out the names of the guys who were present there. I got so scared and only one thing was flashing in front of my eyes was my career and without thinking I took my best friend's name. The guy who got injured with the footpath block/stone, his friends came to know that it was my best friend who got 10 guys to beat him up. And they went to his house to hit him, thats the reason he isnt talking to me.

I hope you liked this and I also know this is kinda cringe and the one who is only responsible for all this was me, yes I fucked up a lot and I accept my mistake.

Thank you for reading this long.

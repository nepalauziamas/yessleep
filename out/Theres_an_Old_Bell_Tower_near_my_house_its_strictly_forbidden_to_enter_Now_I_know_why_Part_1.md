Part 1.

Have you ever heard of the Bell Witch?

I hadn't until one of my friends at school told me when we passed through the woods near my town, there was a good spot there next to a stream where we used to hang out with friends, in the other direction there was an old church which was mostly just a foundation with parts of walls still standing and a huge bell tower that still stood intact.

We were always told to never go near it by our parents, our parents were told by their parents and... you get the idea.

Now, I know this is Scotland and the Bell Witch was in Tennessee, but the stories and legends of this bell tower have similarities to the Bell Witch cave. My friend Brian told me about Bell Witch Cave and said that it was the same entity who haunted the old bell tower, how or why was never included in the story and I never believed it anyway, although the tower has always peaked my curiosity.

Up until today we have never went against our parent's wishes, but here we are, buying torches with our pocket money and gathering supplies for our little excursion, Brian wants to go at night, I'm not exactly into that.

We have agreed to go during the day, and decide whether we want to return for a night time visit.

It's not because I'm scared of some ghost story or some legend, it's because there could literally be any weirdo in those woods prowling around for whatever reason, we're just teenagers, I dont think we can fight off any psychotic maniacs that hang around woods alone at night.

My name is Danny, I'm 14 next month, Brian is my best friend, he just turned 15 two weeks ago and our other friend Liam is 16, he grew up next door to Brian and he's always been kind of our 'leader', like the one we look up to, he's a tall, cool kid, popular in school and has a girlfriend.
I really found myself always wanting to be like Liam but in reality I'm nowhere near, I'm short and kinda overweight, Brian is too in fact, we are a bit of a mismatch of friends but we have always stuck together.

We have a pretty random bag of supplies but you never know what you might end up needing, we have a torch each that we just bought, a lighter and 4 candles Brian took from his house, I took my Dad's hammer for protection though I can't imagine anyone of us actually having the guts to use it, a flat headed screwdriver to pick locks, some snacks and juice, a camera and some pens and paper, thinking we can maybe map it out or something, I don't know. We haven't thought it through too much to be honest.

We live in a smallish town called Fort William in the highlands of Scotland, nearer the North of town before you reach Ben Nevis there are some old run down buildings, not many but a few, just through a small wood there is the old church ruin in a semi clear area, it's fenced off with some signage declaring the building is a ruin and is dangerous but the bell tower itself stands perfectly as if it is constantly being restored. 

People say, at obscure times in the night on a full moon or sometimes at particular times on certain days of the year, though the legends are pretty much all over the place and seem to bear little to no factual significance, you can sometimes hear the bells toll as if they are in perfect working order, history tells you the bells last chimed over 200 years ago and I can also say I have never heard them myself, although I know of a few people who would swear on their own grave that they have heard them multiple times throughout the years. 

It was a cold, clear February, Saturday afternoon when we took our trip to the Bell tower, 1 or 2pm if I remember correctly, Liam and Brian were able to climb the fence no problem after giving me a boost over.

We stood looking at the bell tower, it must be 50, maybe even over 60 feet high, it's big, made from old, large 17th century ashlar stone and standing proudly next to the church foundations that have long since crumbled. 

This bell tower has no clock face, the bells were used as a call to prayer throughout the 17th and 18th century from what I've gathered, there are small rectangular windows on 3 of the 4 sides leading all the way up to near the top, I have heard this is where clergy members and church volunteers or trustees would sometimes live but also that it was used to house prisoners of the church who were awaiting trial, primarily blasphemers and people accused of various 'crimes' against the church that were regarded as evil, acting against God's will or associated with some kind of witchcraft.

The history is very scarce, it is mostly vague and littered with stories or tales from unconfirmed sources so really we are not sure what to expect inside, but what I have found out is that between the late 16th and 17th Century, up to 4000 people were tortured and executed in Scotland as 'witches'.

As we stand there staring up at the walls of the tower, I can't help but feel a chill run down my spine, just thinking of what could have possibly gone on within these grounds, I mean in my head it's all nonsense, but it doesn't take away from the fact that at the end of the day, we really cannot possibly know for sure what happened here all those years ago, and that tiny seed of doubt will not budge.

We approached the door tentatively, looking all around for signs of life, not wanting to get caught.

It has a large wooden door with a huge old style lock that had been pulled out and a newer padlock higher up which held it shut.

I quickly took the screw driver out and put it to the keyhole on the padlock. It was way too big to go anywhere near it, I felt defeated already, I didn't know how to pick locks but I figured I could have at least tried.

Liam took the hammer and broke the lock after 3 hits, the padlock didn't break but the latch did and the door opened slightly, a cold musty breeze escaped the tower and made my nose wrinkle, it smelled like damp and old stuff.

Liam opened the door up and we followed him inside, a large wooden staircase spiraled upwards leading to rooms on each floor, there wasn't much other than the stairs and 1 room on the ground level, there was no door to this room and we could see it was empty, aside from leaves and bird droppings and piles of rubble. 

We began to climb the stairs to the first floor, we could see all the way up in the center and counted 5 floors plus an extra stairway at the top the led to the bells. 

The stairs creaked and cracked with every step but felt safe, we felt like they would hold us no problem, until we reached the first floor and saw about 10 or 12 steps lying crumbled in a heap that would lead us to the second floor, after seeing that I felt myself being more careful on the rotting old wood, who know when it could give way and we didn't want to find out.

On the first floor there were 2 rooms, each with another wooden door, only one was padlocked shut.

We went into the first room, an empty stone room with a small rectangular window at one end, there was nothing else to note.

Liam burst the other door open and we entered, there were two windows boarded up, it was really dark, we could see two old wooden bed frames, one mostly broken up.

The chill in this room was bitter, the windows were probably boarded because they had been smashed so the cold air would be constantly getting in, Liam and Brian walked out almost as quick as we walked in, I hovered around for a few seconds because I felt like something had me in it's sights, in one of the corners I could almost make out what appeared to be a black mass, though it could have just been the darkness of the room, even still, looking in that direction made my hairs stand up and I could feel adrenaline begin to flow through my body.

I hastily left to find Liam and Brian assessing the stairway leading up.

'We'll come back with a ladder' Liam exclaimed, looking up and down judging the height, 'my Dad has a small ladder that should just make it'.

Brian stared at me looking for me to agree.

'Okay' I replied, uncertainty in my voice. 'We coming back tomorrow then?' I asked. 

Liam turned round smiling, 'nah fuck that, let's do it tonight' he looked at both Brian and I with excitement building in his face.

Brian laughed, 'sounds like a plan' and nodded in my direction.

I was extremely dubious about this idea but I didn't want to be the one to say no.
I nodded at Brian and Liam then quickly turned to make my way downstairs, I could hear them quietly relishing in the idea of this 'scary' adventure as they began to follow me down. 

The front door was closed. 

I tried opening it but it wouldn't budge, I started to panic and shouted for them to hurry, Liam came first,

'What's wrong?' He asked looking at me and the door.

'The door won't open' I choked, I felt like I wanted to cry, I felt like we were trapped here forever.

Liam pushed the door, then gave it a shove with his shoulder. 

It swung open. 

I could feel the fear drain from my body instantly as I now began to feel stupid. I looked sheepishly at both of them.

'Its just an old door, calm yourself down Danny' Brian said stifling a laugh as he followed Liam outside.

I felt like such a loser, panicking like that.

We hopped the fence and began walking back, since our exploration was cut short we found a park with some benches and ate our snacks while we planned out the night.

We would use the classic tactic of, I'm staying at Brian's, Liam is staying at my house and Brian is staying with Liam, then we would meet up with our supplies and our bikes before we head back about 10 or 11pm, I don't know how Liam was sneaking a ladder from his house but that was his problem, this was kinda his idea so I can only hope he gets caught and isn't allowed to go.

That night at 9pm I cycled out and met Brian at the end of the main street, we waited for Liam who was notorious for being late, but to be fair he had to bring a ladder on a bike, how difficult that could possibly be I had no idea so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

20 or 25 minutes later Liam shows up on his bicycle with his bag, and ladder-less.

'Where is it?' asked Brian sharply.

'Looks like we can't go now' I was thinking to myself half ready to jump back on my bike.

'I carried it up earlier, I can't cycle with a fuckin ladder hanging off me' he joked back, then smirked at me as if he knew I just wanted to go home.

'We doing this or what!?' Liam continued, after a brief silence.

'Let's go' Brian nodded to both of us.

Brian led the way, Liam was behind and I was at the back trying to take my time.

I seriously had a bad feeling but everything in me wanted to prove myself to them and prove to myself that I wasn't scared.

We rolled up to the fence and set our bikes against it, same as before we all hopped over with no problems, I did think at this time we should have brought some kind of bolt cutters or something to just cut a small slit and move the fence incase we had to get out fast for whatever reason... too late now I suppose.

Torches fired up we made out way through the rotten wooden door, instantly the ice cold air pricked my skin as we entered.

The air seemed different, the world was still and complete silence fell on us as the wooden door shut behind us. 
We all stood looking up, the flights of crumbling stairs winding around the square building leading to the complete abyss above us, it made me shudder.

'Right let's go' Liam said just above a whisper as he grabbed the ladder that was leaning against the first set of stairs.

We climbed up to the first floor, the three torch lights darting across the walls with every creak and rustle we heard.
We came to the first floor with the two doors.

'Did we check both of these rooms earlier?' Brian asked.

Liam replied 'Yep, but let's have a quick look in and make sure there's nothing there, 'Danny look in that first room, Brian you check in there' he pointed to the room that was padlocked before on the other side. 'I'll get the ladder set up'.

I looked at Brian who was only too quick to amble over to his door and open it to glance inside. I saw him disappear into the black as I hesitantly turned to check the other room. 

I opened the door slowly and looked inside shining my torch to the back walls and corners, I couldn't see anything, I felt safe enough with my torch so I entered the room.
The door swung shut behind me and I took one step to the left, behind where the door would open.

'Welcome to hell children!!' A loud menacing voice cried from behind me.

I jumped back and dropped my torch, the glowing red eyes on the head of what looked like a tall, slim and horrifying clown with the biggest smile on his face, his black and white checkered clothes soaked in blood as his head moved from side to side, my heart was racing, I couldn't scream, I couldn't move, I felt... I felt like I...

'Step right up and get your tickets to hell, aaaahahahahahaha' the creepy voice continued, the head was moving side to side and the hands moving back and forward.

I finally was able to grab my torch after sliding myself away from the clown.

'You fucking pricks!!!' I screamed and I shone my torch on the clown.

It was one of those standing clown Halloween decorations that are set off by movement.

Brian and Liam burst into the room laughing their heads off, I was shaking with so much fear but so much anger.

'Fuck you two, I'm going home!' I said pulling myself to my feet.

'Danny it was just a joke, I'm sorry' Liam said, still laughing like a mad man.

'It was just a wind up Danny, we won't do it again, I promise' Brian added, more sincere but still holding back his laughter.

I looked at both of them and just walked out shaking my head.

'Let's get this ladder up and get this over and done with then' I muttered as I approached the fallen stairs.

Liam set the ladder to the lowest hanging part, it wouldn't be easy but it was definitely doable.
Standing on the top step of the ladder the stair came to about chest height with some re-bar poking out the front and sides, you could grasp these bars and push yourself high enough to swing a leg up.

Liam went first and immediately started climbing the stairs to the second floor, I went second and waited on Brian.

We walked up together, Brian could tell I wasn't happy so he tried to reassure me that there would be no more messing around. I just wanted to go home, I didn't care anymore.

We got to the second landing, Liam was nowhere to be seen, I shot an accusing glance at Brian, he just shrugged his shoulders, he was just as confused as me.

There were three doors on this floor, one open and two closed.

'Suppose we just walk into these rooms and wait for Liam to jump out on us or something!?' I said sarcastically rolling my eyes 'how fucking original!'

'Liam, just come out, we're not here to play games' Brian shouted towards the open door.

We were shining our torches inside but couldn't  see anything.

'Liam, just come out man!' I shouted next.

A noise from behind startled us both, the torches were immediately trained on the opening door as we turned so fast to see Liam standing in the open doorway. 

'I'm in here idiots, hurry up' Liam's voice came from the open room we were now glaring into with a look of confusion.

'Come and look at this!' Liam said as he disappeared into the room.

Brian started walking and I grabbed his shoulder.

'Hold on Brian, what the fuck? Why was that other door opening?? There must be someone in there!' I said sternly, my voice was trembling.

'It was probably just the wind, nobody can get up the stairs remember' Brian shrugged my hand from his shoulder as he turned to follow Liam into the other room.

All sorts of horrors were racing through my over active mind but in the end I followed behind Brian, he was probably right.

As soon as I set a foot into the room.

'Hey!... Danny!' A cold whisper echoed from behind me.

I almost snapped my neck as I turned and shot my torch over to the door on other side of the landing.
 
The torchlight glided along the wall as I turned.

Just as it met the door. 

'Click'

The door quietly clicked shut.

Part 1.

Brian spoke as I caught myself off guard [thinking about Liam.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ugtih0/theres_an_old_bell_tower_near_my_house_its/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

He lay on the grass holding an air rifle I had got a couple of months ago for my 19th birthday.

Aiming down the sight at two magpies pecking at the soil for food he spoke to himself, 'One for sorrow, two for joy' he said, swaying the rifle between the two birds.
'One for sorrow... two for...' he hesitated a moment. 'Joy!' he finished as he pulled the trigger.

In a second the magpie was on it's side, one wing flapping wildly while the other never moved at all, the other bird, startled, flew away to safety.

The poor thing struggled and tried to run or fly away but it was too late, the damaged was done.

'Ooohh! Fucking boom man did you see that shot?' Brian said as he pumped his fist in the air, he was a bit too excited.

I looked on and ever so slightly nodded, I was not anywhere near as excited to see a bird struggling for it's life as he was, this wasn't exactly what I had in mind for the air rifle.

Brian began running over to the dying animal, 'come on Danny let's go see' he barked as he lit up a cigarette.

I took my time following Brian over.

He picked the bird up and snapped it's neck.

I recoiled in shock, 'Brian!! fuck sake man!'

'Putting it out of it's misery!' He snapped back.

'Still, it's horrible, you're banned from using the gun from now on!' I said picking it up off the ground.

'Right okay, whatever' he laughed, what we doing today anyway? We should get some cans and go to the pond!'

We sometimes got some cans of beer and sat by a Pond situated within a country park, not many people went down that way but there were a few benches and it was a nice spot to get drunk and hang out.

Sure we could go to pubs and drink like 'normal people' do but we like the calm, we were a little more withdrawn than most people.

'Whatever, I'm not bothered, nothing else to do anyway' I replied looking in the distance.

I could see someone walking towards us but couldn't quite make them out, it was a large field with any number of directions to walk but they were coming straight for us.

'Who's that?' I asked Brian, squinting my eyes in the sunlight.

Brian turned with the dead magpie still in his hand.

'No idea, looks like it could be Shawn' he shrugged, sounding like he didn't care.

'Okay!? So why the fuck is he walking all the way over to us?' I asked, already suspecting the answer.

'Because I told him we would be here with the air rifle, calm down Danny, Shawn's alright' Brian began walking towards him.

Seconds later I heard Shawn's annoying as fuck voice.

Shawn and I never really got along, he's owed me Â£30 for about 3 years for a start, but apart from that, he's just annoying, smarmy, always acts like he knows everything and lies about everything to one up anything you've done.

We used to always say, if you've been to Tenerife, he's been to Eleven-erife!

Brian loved him though, probably because they drank a lot together, and while I did drink now and then, it was never as much as those two, they also smoked weed occasionally, whereas I never smoked.

'Brian, how are you brother' Shawn said holding his arms out for a hug.

'I'm brilliant Shawn' Brian replied as he reciprocated.

I rolled my eyes at the over exaggerated greetings.

'Danny' Shawn came over to meet me, 'still a mummy's boy?' He laughed and acted smug patting my face with his hand, thinking he was hilarious.

'Good one' I said, looking at the air rifle, imagining myself just firing it into his face.

In the past 5 years Brian had become a bit of a wildcard, he started drinking not long after Liam went missing, I mean I had some rough times too but I dealt with it in different ways.
Brian seemed to go off the rails a bit.

He fell in with a crowd of guys we were in school with but never really knew at the time, Ashwin, an Indian kid whose Mum died when he was young and his dad was extremely strict and also an alcoholic, Dennis who had been caught dealing drugs at school and spent time in a young offenders institute, then there was Shawn, his Dad abused him, his Mum and his brothers before his older brother snapped and gave him brain damage by hitting him with a car.

The three most fucked up kids in school somehow found each other and became best friends, make of that what you will, I'm sure there's a psychology experiment in there somewhere.

To be fair to Ash and Dennis, they were actually really nice guys once you got to know them, but Shaun was always just a total dick, I always thought if Liam was here he would have done something about Shawn, put him in his place somehow.

I genuinely missed Liam, he could be an asshole sometimes but he always kept us grounded and stuck up for us, we would probably never have even known these guys if he was here.

Shawn and Brian were chatting just ahead of me I'm hushed voices.

Brian seemed to get agitated before he stormed away from Shawn.

He walked right past me, he was clearly pissed off about something.

'What have you said to him Shawn? Why is he storming away?' I asked, demanding an answer immediately.

Shawn took a step towards me with a wild expression on his face. 

Out of pure instinct I raised the air rifle and took aim at his face 'stay back man, I fucking swear I'll shoot you!' I said in a commanding tone.

Shawn laughed, 'Danny, get a grip, I'm not gonna do anything' 
'I come in peace!' He said sarcastically as he took another step toward me.

'Then why did Brian storm off? Why you coming for me like a weirdo?' I took a step back, still aiming the rifle.

'I'm not coming for you, I'm just coming over to you, put the fucking rifle down you look stupid!' He said.

I did feel a bit stupid to be honest.

Shawn continued, 'I was just telling Brian I went down to the old bell tower earlier'.

A few hairs pricked up on my arms.

'And?' I said as I lowered the gun, my voice was weak.

'Aaand, Danny boy!' He started with a smile, 'I saw someone looking out from the top, and I can say with about 90% certainty, it was that older boy you used to hang around with, the one that went missing, William or whatever'.

'Its Liam, dickhead' I snapped back, jolting the rifle in his direction, 'and no you didn't, people already checked the bell tower when the search parties were out, if you know what's good for you, you'll stay away from there'.

Images of our time in the tower flashed in my mind, things I've spent years trying to forget.

'Ha! whatever, its just a shitty old building' he declared as he partially turned round, 'anyway, I saw what I saw, he might be hiding out there or something, but if you're all too scared of stupid a ghost story to get your friend back then that's your problem'
He turned back to me and threw his arms up, 'Don't shoot the messenger!' He said with high pitched, unreal sarcasm in his voice and a shit eating smirk on his face.

Shawn began walking back the way he came, the urge to shoot him in the back of the head was unbearable.

It couldn't be him, it couldn't have been Liam.

The whole way home I couldn't stop thinking about it, I didn't think Shawn knew about our night in the bell tower, unless Brian told him but we agreed to never tell anyone, so him saying that really struck a nerve, it didnt make sense... Brian must have said something. 

After that night, Liam disappeared from his house not long after we left, the last I seen him was when he left the garage to go to bed. 

His Dad seen him acting strange in the garden, walking in circles and mumbling incoherently before he suddenly sprinted away.

Liam's Dad gave chase but couldn't keep up with his younger, fitter son.

After that, he was never seen again, he wasn't caught on any CCTV, no other witnesses came forward with sightings, it seemed that he had simply just vanished off the face of the earth.

His parents were of course devastated, we searched for months, as a matter of fact, we never have truly stopped searching, even after search parties and police efforts were eventually cancelled, right up until recently, Myself and Brian would often sneak out at night and look for him, through the woods, the outskirts of town or the abandoned houses, sometimes even going to the bell tower and calling his name from outside the fence, but nothing ever came of it, we were too scared to go back inside.

Liam's Dad and two uncles had already searched the bell tower top to bottom one morning not long after he went missing, not because of anything we had said, just because it was a place near town where somebody could hide, they said there was nothing inside worth mentioning.

As the years passed, the world turned and new things peaked the public's interest, other stories came and went and Liam's disappearance faded into the background of people's minds, but we never forgot, we will never forget as long as we live and we will never stop looking for him.

Shawn saying that today hit me hard, I couldn't decide if he was just being a prick or if he was sincere, if Brian told him about the bell tower then maybe he's just trying, and miserably failing, to be funny, but on the other hand, if Brian hadn't told him, then what could possibly make him say that? The thought gave me chills.

Too many questions in my head, I started feeling sick again thinking about everything, I just wanted to get home and lie down.

When I eventually got home, I went straight to my room, I put some Pink Floyd on and lay on my bed, it was only mid afternoon but my brain was tired, playing over everything in my head, sorting my thoughts out, it was mentally draining.

It wasn't long before I drifted off and fell asleep.

I had dreams about the bell tower, that clown thing was dancing in a window laughing frantically as it's arms stretched out to about 40 feet long to grab Me and Brian and pull us up and back inside.

Liam was behind it pulling strings and dancing too.

I woke up sweating and breathing heavily.

I wasn't sure of I was definitely awake or not.

It was night time.

The moon light shone in through my window and glistened on my damp skin.

I didn't even know what time it was, I searched for my mobile phone, it wasn't on my bed, wasn't on the floor, wasn't on my bedside table.

'Where the fuck is it?' I questioned myself, 'What time is it?'

Then I knew.

Suddenly I knew the time.

In the distance, as clear as day.

Those old bells tolled midnight once again.

My phone lit up from the other side of the room.

Brian was calling me.

Hi, this is Amelia talking. Or writing. I'm actually using a voice to text thing, so I guess it could be either.
 
The truth is that I'm tired, but I needed to write this update. Jack was really the one that kept all the notes, but when I think about everything we've written down, all of that could be our last real mark on the world. Everything in our lives would kind of boil down to our last few scribbles.
 
So I wanted my voice in here, kind of a "I too have lived and loved" thing. We've been such victims to all of this that we're just trying to control how it all ends, even if that just means telling our story. I don't think there will be much more to tell.
 
I wanted to start by talking about how I feel, and it's an understatement to say that it's hard to explain. The truth is that I can feel Grace. I've always felt her, I just didn't know what it was, and I guess I still don't.
 
Imagine what it would be like to spend your entire life with someone standing inches behind you, their chin almost resting on your shoulder, so you can feel them, you get used to their breath, but you never really know they're there, just because they've always been there. Then one day, you're talking to someone and they say, who's that behind you? You turn your head and make eye contact with someone that's been breathing on your neck for over twenty years.
 
That's what I think it has been like with Grace. My whole life, at least what I can remember, she's been right there, like a shard of glass buried inside me.

Since this started, I had thought that if that was true, if there really is someone there inside me, then maybe there was some way that we could communicate. She talked to Jack through me, but if we share the same body, there had to be a way to connect. I started using a meditation trick to see if I could find her.

I imagine myself in a white room. Not even a room, just more like a white cube. I'm against a wall, and there's nothing else except for a yellow door on the side farthest from me. I try to block everything else out and just sit in that room, hoping that Grace will come through the door. Willing her to come through the door. I imagine myself calling out, that maybe she's just on the other side in a room with no light looking for a handle.

I fixate on the yellow painted wood, and study every detail of it, but it never opens.

Over time the room became more and more detailed in my mind, and it became easier for me to go there and tune everything else out. I hoped that I could find that room in a dream, as close to my subconscious as I could be, and find Grace there.

A little off-topic, but I also think it's important to share that we've done some good recently. It hasn't all been doom and gloom. Jack wanted to stay laser focused on the mission, but a situation popped up that we couldn't walk away from.
 
We were passing through a town on the way to Dr. Mann's address when we received an amber alert, a child had been taken. How many times in my life had I seen something like that and almost immediately forgotten about it? Not really on purpose, but there was just no way for me to help. I knew that Grace changed that.
 
"Who took the missing child?" Jack asked that night.
 
"Anthony Lawrence," Grace said.
 
We called it in anonymously with the police the next day, and that evening on our way out of town, we heard on the radio that he had been arrested and the child was rescued. Case closed.
 
That's another reason why it's so important for me to speak up, because I realize I also need to be a voice for Grace. Whatever she is, she helped that child. I think if we had to live with Grace forever, at least we would hold on to the ability to help other people.
 
Even as I say that though, I know it isn't possible, no matter how much good we could do. My body has been wasting away. I've never felt so weak in my life. My skin looks almost transparant sometimes when I'm in the sun. It feels like even though Grace is this dormant consciousness that isn't in control, she's taking just as much or more energy than I am.

If I'd known this would all happen, I would have gained some weight in preparation.

Sorry. I try my best to find ways to keep this light-hearted, but it always kind of falls flat.

There's one more reason we have a need to solve our mystery. We've seen the man that came to the apartment twice since then, once in the town where the girl was abducted, and another time just on the road driving past us. Both times were close calls. We don't know what he wants and we don't know how he keeps finding us, but we've started to assume that he's always just around the corner.
 
So we went after Dr. Howard Mann, with the smallest hope that we would find him still, alive and well. I secretly thought it would be like a movie where the person who knows too much goes underground, waiting for their chance to show up right at the end to save the hero from going over the cliff.
 
Not this time. Many of the people in the area knew of the late Howard Mann, and he was truly gone. The trail didn't run cold though, he was survived by a single daughter, Dr. Stephanie Mann, and Grace helped us find her in just a few nights. She agreed to meet with us, and we felt lucky to have things moving somewhat quickly.

First impressions, she's incredible. She recognized that I had some kind of serious condition immediately, and actually set me up on an IV in her house. The said I was obviously malnourished and dehydrated. She even came at Jack, accusing him of putting me through some terrible treatment, but we were able to calm her down enough to tell her what was actually happening.
 
Suffice it to say that telling our entire story to her was difficult. Jack started by mentioning her father, which might have been a mistake, and the rest of the time she was very tense. She looked like a woman that was putting a puzzle together in her mind, but had always been missing a few pieces.

More than ever we knew just how crazy it all sounded. We were just happy to have an audience with her. Jack told almost every detail, including what he almost did all that time ago at the campsite. I watched his face as he told the story, and I thought about how much he had done for me, before and after that.
 
I love him so much, and I hate that so much of our time together has been spent this way.
 
When the story was over, we sat there in her living room for a while, waiting for any kind of reaction.
 
"Dr. Mann, between what's happened to us, and Amelia's mother, and your father...," Jack told her, "We just need help."
 
She didn't respond, and hadn't really spoken much in a while. She kept her eyes on me throughout much of the story, and once the story was over, she stood up, and walked towards me. My stomach immediately turned, the same feeling as if I had suddenly been asked to give a speech in front of hundreds of people.
 
"You truly have one inside of you," she said, "Don't you? I never believed."
 
I felt my heart pass by for a couple beats. Jack stood up and looked back and forth between myself and Dr. Mann.
 
"One of what?" I asked, my voice shaking.
 
"Mother, is that you?" she whispered.
 
Before I could respond, a knock at the door. We had been there less than an hour at that point. Stephanie didn't even move, she kept her eyes on me. Jack walked across the room, and looked out the peephole.
 
"No way," he said, "Dr. Mann?"
 
She didn't respond. I stood up and took her hands in mine.
 
"I can't believe it," she said.
 
"Dr. Mann, we don't have time right now," Jack said.
 
His voice sounded urgent.
 
"Who is it?" I asked.
 
"It's him," he said.
 
The man with the shifting face.
 
Another knock at the door, this time louder than before.
 
"Stephanie, are you home?" asked the man.
 
"Oh, he's an old family friend, it's just Matthew," Stephanie said, starting to move towards the door.
 
Jack got to her first and held her still.
 
"Listen, I don't know if you really know who he is, maybe he's tricking you or maybe you're tricking us, but if you're with us, you can't open the door, that man is after Amelia," Jack said.
 
"It's the same guy?" I asked.
 
"He's the same, but he looks a lot older," Jack said.
 
"He was friends with my dad, they did research together," Stephanie said.
 
"Was he around when your dad died?" Jack asked quietly.
 
The question hit Stephanie hard, more puzzle pieces falling into place.
 
"I have to at least talk to him," she said, "I just met you a few minutes ago, I've known him my whole life."
 
The man called out again.
 
"Stephanie, I can tell that you're home, I'm sorry to just pop in like this but I honestly just wanted to see how you were doing," he said, "I can come back if you're busy."
 
"No it's okay," Stephanie called back, "I got held up. I'll let you in."
 
Jack let her go and came over to me.

"It'll be fine, I promise," Stephanie said, "If anything, he can help too."

She never had the chance to open the door. She reached out her hand, and the wood splintered. Stephanie was knocked a few feet back into the room on her side, and the man came walking in past her.

He stopped completely when he saw myself and Jack. I thought that he smiled, Jack thought he frowned. Then he made a noise. I couldn't understand it, but Jack had heard it before. It sounded like he was humming as he breathed in all the air in the room. In the weirdest way, it did sound like he said 'Grace', but it didn't sound benevolent. My stomach turned, and I felt a sharp pain in my head.

Jack started to speak, but was cut off by the man.

"Don't talk," he said.

His voice grated against my skull. It sounded like there were two people talking at once. Jack ran over to Stephanie to check on her. He looked back at me and nodded, she was okay.

"What do you want?" Jack asked.

The man was staring at me now.

"I said don't talk. If you say anything else, I'll kill both of you right now. I'm giving her a final chance to play along, as a gift," he said, "You people really are all the same. You have no idea how painful it is for me to be here, to hear the pointless, boring thoughts that go through this man's mind."

The two separate voices sawed on each other as the man tapped a finger on the side of his head. He strolled through the house, never letting his eyes leave mine.

"All of this work, all of this time. So, utterly, infinitely boring," he said.

Jack came across the room swinging a lamp. It was over quickly, the man gave one quick kick and sent Jack flying into the wall.

I shut my eyes, and I thought of Grace.

*Grace, please. I don't know what's happening here, but I know you're there. Can you hear me?*

I let my mind drift back into the white room with the yellow door.

*Grace, please just tell me if you're there. We need help.*

"She doesn't belong here," the man said, "You see how she's eating away at you? You're wasting down into nothing, but what you're doing to her is far worse. She's the one in the cage, like a lightning bolt shoved into a rubber ball."

I barely heard him. I stayed in the white box.

*Grace, please, can you hear me?*

I felt the man grab my arm. It burned, and his two voices burnt even worse.

"I'm going to take her home now," he whispered, the two voices slamming against each other.

Time seemed to slow down, and I fell into what felt like a dream. The door on the wall of my imaginary room opened just a crack, and a cold wind rushed past me.

*I'm here, Amelia.*

I could see her as she stepped through the door. All I can say is that she was bright, and cold, and I forgot the pain from the man's voice and grip. I heard her thoughts again.

*Amelia, I'm sorry. I can't stay for long. Stand up, and say what I tell you to say.*

When I opened my eyes, I was face to face with the shifting face of the intruder. Each time I closed my eyes, I was back in the white room with Grace. I pulled as hard as I could and ripped my arm away from the man. He looked at me, saw something had changed, and took a few steps back.

*I am not coming with you.*

"I'm not coming with you," I said.

I heard the same dual inflections in my voice that I had heard in his, my voice and hers, only our voices were harmonized.

His head tilted, and he fully smiled.

"So you're awake?" he said, "Why don't you come out to see me face to face?"

*I don't ever want to see you again, and I don't want to hurt you, but I will if you make me.*

"I don't ever want to see you again," I said, still just repeating what I heard her say, "I don't want to hurt you, but I..."

"Oh let me guess," laughed the man.

He made some sounds I couldn't understand, almost yelling, and I felt the floor shake below me. All the glass in the house shattered. I was sure it hadn't been before, but outside it was storming, and rain came in through the now missing windows. He reached out his arm and pointed a long finger straight at me, the wind and rain drowning out the sound of my own quick breaths.

*I'm going to try and talk a little here, just trust me.*

I could have swore she winked.

I heard my voice, our voice, start to sing. The sound lifted up above the storm, and into it. I couldn't understand the words, but I understood the intent. I think somehow Jack understood it too.

He came running from the wall, head down, only this time he didn't try to hit the man, he tackled him, hard, right out through the front door and into the storm. I could hear the man laughing as he brought his elbow down on Jack's back and threw him beside him.

"Well you're the only one actually fighting, I can at least respect that," he said.

"He's not the only one," I heard us say.

Grace and I sang the final notes of this unknown song, and time shook. A lightning bolt ripped down from the sky. The air burned, the rain all around us hung still and evaporated, and I saw Jack's face turn towards me just as the whole world went white.

Everything cleared, slowly, and the man with the shifting face was gone completely. Jack laid in the wet and burning grass on his back without moving. Half of his body was covered in burns and I was sure that he had died.

*Amelia, it's going to be okay.*

She didn't tell me what to do, but I walked over to his body, and placed my hands on either side of his face. He didn't move.

"Can you save him?" I said, although I was talking to Grace.

*In a way. Keep your hands on him.*

Grace went silent in my mind. I felt everything that was happening to such an intense degree. Every rain drop that fell on me felt like it weighed a pound. The wind passing over my skin felt like sandpaper. Jack's final heartbeats against my palms felt like war-drums.

Then I felt something else. I can only think of it as an energy. Something inside me was pulling on Jack. It only lasted a few moments, and then I could feel his heartbeat no longer.

*Amelia, we need to rest, but he's okay.*

I heard her voice clearly. I closed my eyes to find her in the white room, but the door was already closed. Behind it I thought I could hear another voice, one that just sounded lost and confused. It was calling out with no one to listen.

I knew that it was Jack's voice.

*Jack, I'm here. I've got you.*

His voice faded away. Then, just as I had come to feel Grace inside me, I could feel him too. Dormant, but existing.

I sat in the yard in front of his body.

"Amelia?" Stephanie said, standing in the doorway holding her head.

I didn't respond, and instead I held my face in my hands and I cried.

Now, a few days later, Dr. Mann and I have a plan, or at least the start of one. It's shaky, and we're pulling heavily from her father's research, but we're confident. She is, especially.

Jack is okay. It's a lot easier for me to talk to him than it is for him to talk to me, but he's okay. I can't think too much about what's happening to him or I think I'll go crazy.

As far as Grace goes, I haven't talked to her since that night, and she feels different than before, more peaceful I guess. I've felt better than I have in a long time. Something has changed, and for the better.

One thing is certain. I will not let Jack go, not like this. 

I will let you [know what happens next](https://reddit.com/user/thebuffed/comments/pplmtp/writing_list_and_faq/). We're near the end now.

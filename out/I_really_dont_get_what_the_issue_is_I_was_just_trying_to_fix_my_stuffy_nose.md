After I told him what happened, a buddy of mine recommended that I write this story out to "process my emotions better." I figure it's worth it for a laugh, so here we go:

It started with my girlfriend. My lovely, cute girlfriend. I'm going on a trip to the U.K. soon for a wedding, you see, and she and I just had to see each other before I left. I invited her to stay at my house despite the fact that we both knew she was sick with a (non-Covid) cold of some kind or another: itchy eyes, clogged sinuses, the works. 

Inevitably I fell victim to whatever illness plagued her, and so we bravely suffered our sick sick nights together, much like Juliet poisoning herself to be with her Romeo. Just kidding. As usual she conked out within minutes and I fell into my typical routine of tossing and turning for an hour and a half or so before slowly drifting off (it's a whole process). Unfortunately, my sickly body had other plans: mainly keeping me awake coughing and failing to breathe through my nose for the entire forking night. 

However, after three long, agonizing nights I decided I was finally going to take back my freedom: I would breathe through my nose before the night was through. And goddammit, I did it. After working through a couple face massage techniques and doing a bit of work with some tools I was able to breathe clear as day. Naturally, clearing a blockage like that made my nostrils get pretty bloody, but at that point all I wanted was sweet sweet sleep, and fresh air. I know that sounds strange, but trust me when I say I was incredibly sleep deprived and not thinking about much besides Dreamland.

The next morning, unfortunately, my girlfriend and mom were significantly less relaxed about the blood on my face.  Maybe they were worried about me or maybe they were just worried about the mess I was making, but either way they rushed me to someone to help with the blood. The whole time we were there the people helping with the blood and my mom and my girlfriend and my buddy with the clipboard who wants me to write this post all kept asking the same question: "How did this happen to you?!" And so I'll tell you, Reddit, what I told all of them:

After I massaged my face for a while I could breathe the slightest bit better but I knew I could do even better. So I looked for the best tool I could and inevitably sertled on some sturdy tweezersâ€“ you know, the kind you can use for woodworking, or maybe garden work. Then I ventured up a nostril with one goal in my head: pull and pull further and further up until there were no more boogers that could possibly block my sinuses. And no matter what anyone else says I'm breathing better than ever now. 

I'm not too sure why my buddy wanted me to write this so bad, I'm just doing it so he doesn't put that weird jacket on me. Maybe he's convinced that it'll convince me to reattach the nose. But it's like I keep saying: me and my nostrils have never been breathing better!

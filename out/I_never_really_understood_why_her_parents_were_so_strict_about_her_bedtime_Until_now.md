I had just finished a really tough year of college and planned on taking it easy for the summer. But I’m broke and my friends were going to Germany in august, so I needed some extra cash to pay for it. I tried asking my parents for the money. They just laughed at me and told me to get a job. It’s not fair my friends had everything paid for them, but then again, their parents were actually nice. I'd bet if it was my little sister that was going, they would fly her out there first class, they think the sun shines out of her ass.

They expected me to look after some little brat all summer, while my friends were relaxing at the beach, to make it worse, I hated babysitting, but what choice had I got? The only upside was the money, it was good, I mean really good. That’s the only reason I’d ever take a job looking after a snotty little shit like that. Her name was Sarah, she had just moved in, around the corner from us, my mom got talking to her mom Kate at the store and offered my services, without my permission, I might add. When she came home, all she could talk about was how adorable she was, it makes me sick.

I know I might come off a bit severe, I do like children. Well, maybe like, is a bit too strong of a word, I can bare them, in small doses that is. but I really hate that blondie little troll and her stupid ponytail, everyone thought she was so cute, with her, “I'm sowwy” and shit like that. She only talks like that to distract people from what she really is, the bitch. 

Again, its easy to judge me without knowing the full story, she’s not the pretty little princess that she lets on, no. She’s a monster. The first time I met her, I thought she was perfect too, she acted like a polite, well-mannered gift from God. She always done everything I asked her to do, and never made a mess. I didn’t even have to entertain her; she would just sit at her table doodling all day. Every night before I left, she would give me a drawing of us holding hands smiling, my mom loved them she started hanging them on the fridge. So, at first it was not all bad, all I had to do was sit and watch tv all day and get paid for it. Her parents worked together and were always home by 8 every night. As soon as they got in the door, they used to rush me out of there. I found this a bit strange, but assumed it was because of Sarah's bedtime. I often heard them argue about it, but I never understood why it was such a big deal, until that horrible night.

It was about 8:30 and for the first time her parents were late. I didn’t mind, but Sarah started to become agitated, and found it hard to sit still, her legs were rocking over and back under the table. Then she began to sing, for a while I thought it was a nursery rhyme from some kids show.

Until I actually listened to the words, “9 o clock is when I wake, so in my bed I need to wait, or the evil will be free, to take full control of me, so lock my door, throw away the key, until morning, or you will see.”

It started to freak me out, so I asked her to stop, but it only made things worse. She started swinging her legs faster while shouting the words louder and louder, for a finish I had to cover my ears with my hands. I didn’t know what to do. Then all of a sudden, she just stopped. I asked her if she was ok, but she wouldn’t answer me, she was just sitting there staring down at the table. I looked at the clock, it was 8:53 and there was still no sign of her parents

I slowly made my way over to her, nervously calling her name, but she still didn't answer me, I was becoming worried, I thought there was something wrong with her. I put my hand on her shoulder and was about to speak when she growled at me, I thought what the fuck is wrong with her, and shouted, “SARAH” 

She must have snapped out of it because she began to speak, “I need to go to bed now.”

I replied, “Your parents will be back in a minute, you can go to bed then” in a nice calm tone.

She started to become really aggressive then, and shouted, “I NEED TO GO TO BED NOW, it’s nearly nine” as she got up and made her way out of the kitchen and down the hallway. 

 I ran after her, grabbed her arm, and said, “NO. Wait for your parents” in a stern voice.

That’s when she showed her true colors, she started kicking and screaming and when I wouldn’t let her go. She bit me on the arm then ran down the hallway towards her room. I was fuming, I 2chased after her as fast as I could, but it was too late. She ran into her room and locked the door. I tried to open it, but it had some sort of electronic lock on it. I slapped the door with my hand full force, with temper, but it was metal, and I nearly broke my hand. I was surprised it just seemed like any normal wooden door by looking at it. 

There was a small window halfway up the door, when I looked in the light was off, I could just about see her in the corner. I ordered her to come out, but she just laughed uncontrollably in a weird voice, it seemed to go from a deep Barry White tone to a high-pitched screech that only dogs could probably hear. Then she started to sing the stupid song again, it was then I heard the front door opening, I turned and looked down the hallway to see who it was, but I couldn’t see anything. When I looked back, she was staring at me through the small window on the door, it looked like she was wearing some sort of creepy mask.

Then I heard her dad Liam calling me, he sounded concerned. I called him down because I wanted to show him what his daughter was up to, but she was gone by the time he got there. I was still pissed when I told him what had happened, but he was really nice about it and gave me a big bonus for my troubles. He said Sarah has a condition and gets very cranky if she stays up late. I don’t know what kind of condition she has, but surely there is some kind of medication for it, is what I said to him before storming out of there. On that walk home I swore that I'd never set one foot inside that door ever again.

The next day he rang me again to apologize. He said Sarah really liked me and she would never shut up about me when I left. I thought wow, first of all, I never heard her say more than three words at a time. Second, if she liked me that much and still tried to take a lump out of my arm, what would she do to someone she didn’t like? He swore it would never happen again, and offered me a lot more money, he even said he would pay for some of my trip, if I just stayed, I still said no I wanted to be done with it. I started looking for a new job straight away, none of which would pay anything even close to what he was giving me. By that night I started to feel deflated, every job seemed like...  like... work I suppose. I was just used to sitting on my ass watching tv every day, now I'd have to actually do something.

I was running out of time and would have to work some serious hours to make enough money to go on that trip, so I was ready to give up. I was about to call my friends and let them know I wouldn’t be going, when Liam rang again, this time he offered to pay for the whole trip, all I would need was spending money. I told him I'd think about it. He said I have to let him know by tomorrow or he will find someone else. I don’t really want to go back to that little shit, but I will get a free trip out of it, plus it's only for a few weeks.

I awoke to the dull buzz of the overhead lights. Just a normal day at the headquarters. I was called in to run checks on an unknown entity. Everything went smoothly, and we all went through our day as normal. At lunch, I sat with my friend Sjōn at our usual table spot-- DT21-- and we chatted about work. Sjōn brings up the entity but I quickly change the conversation as it is against the rules to mention the entity outside of it's special area.

That's when it struck. Whatever it was we were researching, it broke out. Sjōn and I quickly hid under the table. All we were able to hear was the sounds of screaming coming from all sides. Suddenly, we heard splashing and spraying. A couple of the screams went silent. Loud thuds and scraping metal echoed throughout the building.

"What the hell is going on?" I ask Sjōn via sign language, afraid to make any verbal noise that might attract this entity. Sjōn just stares at me, ghost white. We both knew we were in danger. The lights flicker, then they stay solid. Sjōn and I hear orders being yelled out, hope filling us. A group of armed, masked men enter the cafeteria. We step out and are immediately apprehended by the men. We note eachother as members from the same organization. Sjōn and I are escorted to a black van. As we traverse the hallways, we spot lots of blood and torn limbs. Whatever it was, it was deadly.

We make it to the van, that's when we encountered it. We were immediately ushured into the van and they sped off. We could hear loud thuds and scraping metal behind us. The sound was getting closer and louder. We managed to lose the entity by driving into the jungle, but we don't know if it's waiting or searching. Suddenly, we hear a loud crash. Knowing the risks, Sjōn-- whom I've forgotten to mention is a Medical Professional at our organization-- and I are eacorted out the van towards the sight of the crash. After around 30 minutes of traversing the jungle, we arrive at the crash. That's when we spot it again, devouring the survivors of the crash, and the plane itself, too. The entity's gaze slowly drifts upward, as it lines up with ours it lets out a defeaning screech and starts moving. The sound of metal scraping is more audible now, and the thuds are loud enough to rupture an eardrum.

One of the armed men with us yell, "Oh shit. Run, whatever that thing is, we definently do not want it to catch us."

Not knowing what else there is to do, we just book it. We ran straight towards the van and started to drive off. There's just one issue with the sight,  how could such a huge entity fit inside the confines of the building it was in? I certainly knew it was the entity I was studying. I never had a visual of it, until now. Shit, my phone's almost dead. Ending Digital Text Log (DTL).

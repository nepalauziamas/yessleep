“Remember, don’t let him outta your sight.” Randy whispered in my ear. I had him in my sights; an eight-pointed buck. It looked at me, locking gaze with me, straight through the scope of my rifle, “Ol’ Darla”.

“I won’t.” I whispered back. I leveled the barrel of “Ol’ Darla” to the deer’s front, poised for a direct heart shot, good and clean. One shot, and *boom*; it was venison for dinner. I could already taste it. *”Nah, you ain’t goin’ nowhere...”*

My finger wrapped around the trigger. Right as I was about to claim my prize, however, the deer jerked its head off to the right towards the trees. It made its little mewling noise before turning tail and darting off into the woods. I fired the shot, but by that time, it was too late. It was long gone, disappearing completely from sight.

*”SON OF A BITCH!”* I thought. I sat back then, already feeling the shame of defeat. Me and Randy had been trying to find game like that for months. Most of em, though, end up being older, wiser; knowin’ better than to be out in the open grazing like that. It *was* a particular hotspot for huntin’ (the best here In Grenview Pines) and they knew it.

“He shoots, and misses, folks!” Randy jeered, chuckling. “‘Adam the Deadeye’ stares destiny in the face and blinks!”

“Yeah, yeah,” I said, sighing and having laugh at it myself. I looked to him; opening the cooler and grabbing and cracking open an ice cold Coors Lite before taking a refreshing swig. “Want one?”

“You know it!” He replied eagerly before plopping down beside me and grabbing a Coors. Taking another swallow, I looked ahead where the deer had ran off.

“Hey,” I said, nudging Randy, “What do you think it was that did it, huh?” He looked at me, raising his eyebrow. “That scared the buck off like that, I mean. What do you think it saw?” He frowned, thinking for a moment, before shrugging and answering that he’d be damned if he knew. “I mean, Hell, you saw it, didn’t ya? That sombitch was *mine*; I had him!”

He downed a swallow of his beer, chuckling himself. I glanced around to the trees behind us. “I mean, you see anything out there? Hear anything?”

“Don’t look at me”, he said. “I was watchin’ YOU the whole time. Hell, you got a closer look at the thing n’ I did. I could barely see it from this far out, you at least had the scope.” I barked a laugh before gulping the last of my Coors.

I started patting my pockets for my pack of cigarettes. I started to panic a bit when I couldn’t find them. *”Where the hell are they? Shit, I’ll just bet my dumb ass went and left ‘em at ho—“*

“Ahem.” Randy said, holding up a pack of Eagle greens. I breathed a sigh of relief and took them. He laughed and remarked “No wonder you lost the buck, you can’t even keep up with your damn cigarettes.” I grinned, rolling my eyes while taking out a smoke and lighting up. I then sat back again, taking a nice long drag of it, savoring it.

“Nah, Pal, I saw it.” I squinted my eyes to the trees ahead, “I saw it in it’s eyes. You didn’t see him; see his *eyes!* I *had* him, he was *mine!*, till somethin’, somewhere went n’ spooked him.” I dragged again at my cigarette before turning to look at Randy again. “You think maybe he saw me?”

He shrugged. “Dunno. Like you said, I ain’t the one that saw him. That bein’ said, I doubt it. You were nice n’ low to the ground and we’re at least a good 35 something-odd yards out from where it was standin’.”

I frowned, taking another drag. *”What the hell did that sucker see? What made him run like that?”* I turned again to him, “And you *sure* you didn’t see nothin’?” He shook his head. “Hear nothin’?”

“No, buddy, I’ve been tellin’ ya, I ain’t seen nothin’, heard nothin’, felt nothin’. All I knew was one minute, you’re about to bag a nice prize, and the next, you miss the money shot and the damn thing’s gone off in the woods.”

“Well shit.” I conceded. I tried thinking again about what could’ve possibly went wrong. *If it didn’t see or hear me, then WHAT HAPPENED?”*

Randy gave me a hard clap on the back, “Ah, don’t worry, there’ll be another.” I looked at him like he’d just told a bad joke. He laughed and said, “Come on, give me a break, I’m tryin’ ta cheer ya up somehow. What, you rather I lie to ya, tell ya it’ll come back?”

“Yeah, thanks *buddy*.” I answered, chuckling while flipping him the bird.

He laughed and joked “Love you, too, pal”. For about half an hour after that, the two of us just rested there while the sun slowly started to set; him downing all but three of the remaining Coors Lites while I smoked another cigarette. I felt Randy nudge me and point to one of the trees, signaling that he needed to drain the lizard.

I nodded and went back to watching the sunset. Everything was calm, quiet, relaxing. That was the beauty of Grenview Pines, see? Everything just had this natural way of making you feel all nice and cozy while out in the wilderness, no Internet, no cell service, nothin’. You didn't need none of that, not in a place as beautiful, as peaceful, and as just plain *alive* as Grenview was. That’s how it was for me, anyways, just me and the the calm, quiet wilderness.

Despite this, for whatever reason, maybe because I was a bit of a sore loser when it came to this sort of thing (after all, there *was* a reason Randy nicknamed me “the deadeye”, and it wasn’t on accident), but I couldn’t for the life of me stop thinking about that damn deer.

What the hell happened? There’s no way it saw me, and it couldn’t have heard me, right? Randy said so himself. So then, what *did* it see? Flicking the rest of my current cigarette out, I peered around to the trees behind me again. By this time, the sun was pretty well gone, making seeing anything in the densely packed woods damn near impossible.

Anything, that is, except for this weird shape perched high in one of the trees right in front of me. I don’t know how, but somehow, who or whatever this thing was, was able to stand out against the already darkened forest behind it. It was a weird shape; like, *sort of* human, but not.

I guess the best way I know how to describe it was that it sort of looked like a giant, lumpy, black blob, a speck, that was perched on the branch with four little stubs that, I guess, you could call “limbs”. Sticking out of the top of it was a single lump that I guess was supposed to be its head or something, with two large, white holes that were beating down on me, watching me. I squinted my eyes, moving to get a closer look.

As I did this, I vaguely noticed it shift forward in my direction from its position on the branch. I rubbed my eyes. My eyes had to be playing tricks with me, I thought. But nope, it was there; right in front of me, sittin’ in the tree. Then I saw the thing raise both of its little stubs to its face, rubbing its eyes.

*"There's no way..."* I thought. *"Did that thing just copy me?"* I stood up. It raised up from its crouching position on the branch. My eyes widened. What the hell was this thing? What was it doing?

I wasn't really scared or anything, sure; but I *was* confused as all hell. I looked over to the cooler at the remaining Coors Lites. For a second, I thought I'd somehow maybe drank too much, even though I was pretty sure I'd I'd only had the one. I looked back up to the trees to see it snap its own "head" back to face me. 

*"It did it again!"* I stood frozen. It stood frozen, staring back at me. I raised my right hand up and waved to it. It copied me, raising its right stub to wave back at me. Then I dropped my right hand and started waving the left. it copied that, too. 

I began to get curious. Wondering just how far I could go with this; just *how* well it could keep up the "Monkey see, Monkey do" routine, I started jumping up and down. It started jumping as well on the branch. Then I decided to try doing jumping jacks. It copied that, too; moving its stubs in the same motion. Then, not knowing what else to try, I decided to take my shirt off and start jumping around, this time shrieking and scratching my head like a monkey. 

Sure enough, to my shock, it copied me perfectly. And when I say "Perfectly", that's what I mean. It wasn't like the way a little kid mimics something they see grown ups do, or characters on TV. No, this thing copied me verbatim, shot-for-shot, and could do it at the exact same time I was. In other words, This thing was like my reflection in a mirror or something, except, of course, that it looked nothing like me (or anybody or any*thing* else for that matter). 

Odd, sure, but it was nothing *too* alarming (I guess...). At least, until I could hear *IT* start shrieking, too. It sounded just like how I did, distinguishable by the fact that my monkey noises usually sound rather hoarse instead of the usual high pitched shrieking you'd usually hear. *Now* I was a little unsettled by this. Again, copying my movements was one thing, but perfectly mimicking my voice, too? Something about that just wasn't sitting right with me.

I didn't know what to do. I felt like trying to move anymore was a bad idea, like letting it mimic me any more would give it some sort of knowledge or power or something. I wasn't sure, but that got the idea stirring up in my head that *that* was why it was there. *"Is this thing trying to spy on me or somethin'?"*

I was still standing there, locked in this little staring contest, when Randy called out to me from the woods. "Hey, how'd you get back here so quick?" My eyes finally broke from the trees to look to him, confused. 

"Huh?" I asked.

"Just a minute ago, you were right behind me. I figured you were takin' a piss, too. I turn around again though, headin' back, and I couldn't see ya no more." He then eyed me up and down and asked what I was doing, why I was standing around bareback. I just looked back at him, more than bewildered myself. 

"Randy... what the hell are you talkin' about?" I asked.  He raised his eyebrow. It was pretty clear by then that neither one of us knew what the heck was going on with the other. "I wasn't in the woods." 

He gave me a skeptical look. "Well then I *really* must've drank one too many, but I swear, God as my witness, I saw you in the woods just now." I shook my head.

"I'm tellin' ya, who or whatever you saw there; it *wasn't me.*" He stared at me disbelievingly again for about half a minute before holding his hands up, conceading. He then sat back down while I stayed standing for a moment longer. Briefly, I chanced a peek back up to the tree limb from earlier. The thing wasn't there anymore. *"Wait, where'd it go?"*

I squinted as hard as I could, first up at the branch, then inside the woods themselves. Nothing. Just the dark, densely packed forest, quiet and empty. 

I started wondering again if I hadn't just been seeing things. I mean, I was *pretty* sure I'd seen it, heard it. One drink wouldn't have messed my head up *that* much, I didn't think. But at the same time, I was also pretty sure there was nothing there before, nothing that could've scared off my deer. I was also pretty sure shit like whatever the hell was in that tree, *weren't* normal. *"What was that thing doin' up there on the tree branch?"*

That question caused my body to break out in a violent shiver. Looking into the woods, I felt like, despite seeing nothing there, *something* was staring back at me, watching me. "You okay there, pal?" Randy asked. 

"Huh?" I replied, snapping back to him, "Oh uh... Yeah. Yeah, I-I'm okay."

"You sure?" He asked, raising his eyebrow, "'Cause you're lookin' like you just saw Bigfoot saunterin' around in the woods there." I rubbed my eyes and chuckled dryly.

"I don't know, man. Maybe I'm just gettin' tired or somethin', ya know?" He snickered and reached into the cooler, pulling out one of the three remaining beers. 

"Here," he said, popping it open and extending it to me. "Take this, maybe it'll take the edge off a bit, huh?" I snickered and took the beer, downing a gulp. He was right. At the moment, at least, I felt able to relax a little again. I sat back down next to Randy, looking up at the now fully nighttime sky. Everything was nice and peaceful again. I'd made it through only about half my drink when I ended up nodding off. 

I woke up a little later, needing to relieve myself, so I groggily shambled over to one of the trees. As I was doing this, though, I heard a noise coming from one of the trees off to the left of me. It, too, was the sound of someone peeing on the ground at the base of a tree. "Randy?" I called out, still half asleep. "That you?" 

I peered around the tree I was peeing behind and instantly tensed up. There it was; that thing from the tree. Like before, It was somehow distinguishable, despite everything else around already being extremely dark. It peered around the tree it was behind to face me, it's large white eyes boring straight through me. I saw that both of its arm stubs were pointed down in between its leg stubs, looking like it, too, was taking a piss. "Who or what the hell are you?!" I cried out to it. 

I still don't know why I did that. What good that was gonna do me, I didn't know. At the same time, I didn't know what *else* to do, either. In any case, though, I will say that I ended up wishing I *hadn't* done that because, next thing I know, I heard the damn thing shout back to me, repeating what I'd just said using *my* voice. I started backpedaling back toward the camp. It then mimicked this by taking steps of its own backwards. As it went, I watched it start to sort of twitch and wriggle, shifting. I then noticed that started to change, transforming until it looked *exactly* like me! 

This made my heart stop mid-beat, my blood freezing almost solid. I couldn't believe what I was seeing, even for just the brief moment I saw it. That was *ME!* It turned into *ME, I was staring at myself!* And this wasn't just some crap imitation, either. No, this thing could've passed itself off as me in public, no problem. Every detail of my face and my body (as well as my voice, apparently), this thing was a picture perfect carbon copy of. Just before it disappeared completely from view farther back in the dense woods, I heard it shout back to me, in a perfect impersonation, "I *had* him, he was *mine!*, till somethin’, somewhere went n’ spooked him.” 

As soon as It was gone, I turned and broke into a full on sprint back to the clearing. Almost immediately, I heard thumping footfalls coming in hot pursuit behind me. I didn't dare look back, afraid of what I'd see. I just kept running, but not able to really see much of where I was going. Eventually, I ended up tripping over what I imagine was a protruding root and faceplanting on the ground. I was out like a light almost instantly. 

I'll admit, I was almost shocked when I actually woke up again that next morning. I was sure I was done for, that thing having been so close on my heels. But sure enough, by God's graces, I was awake; I was alive. This relief soon changed into momentary embarrassment when I found that my clumsy ass hadn't tripped over a root at all, but instead, the beer cooler. I'd actually made it, yet, because it was so  dark, and because I was so focused on running for my life, I likely would've just kept on running right up into the morning, getting lost in the other stretch of woods. I actually found this kind of funny at the time; just the sheer irony of that situation. *"That WOULD be just my damn luck, wouldn't it?"* I thought, snickering. 

I went to the overturned cooler for a beer when I found all of them empty, having all been drank. Now I was alarmed (well, more like aggrevated) *"That little weasel! He knows damn better than to ga and--"* My thoughts froze then I actually looked over to Randy's spot, only to find no Randy. "Randy!" I shouted, cupping my hands around my mouth, "Hey, where are you? Come out so I can kick your ass for drinkin' my last two beers!" 

This was met with only silence at first. Then, from the distance, inside the woods, I heard Randy's voice shouting back, "Don't look at me. I was watchin' YOU the whole time." I stood for a moment, confused.

*"What the hell..."* I called out again, "Randy!" I heard his voice shout back again, this time laughing. 

"No wonder you lost the buck, you can’t even keep up with your damn cigarettes.” I started walking in the direction towards where I was hearing it come from. Randy's voice continued laughing.

"Randy, hey come on, cut it out, man, where are ya?"

“Come on, give me a break, I’m tryin’ ta cheer ya up somehow. What, you rather I lie to ya, tell ya it’ll come back?” I stopped again, frowning. Now, normally, I'd have just figured he was just screwing around with me like usual. Just another of his little pranks after, no doubt, busting his ass laughing after seeing me trip over the beer cooler in the dark while barreling out of the woods like a bat outta Hell. But something about this wasn't striking me as funny (besides the fact that all my beer was gone).

Something felt off. I couldn't tell why at first, but it did, it felt *wrong*. I heard Randy's laughing again coming from the woods. It *was* him; his voice, his laugh, but at the same time, I was getting the horrible feeling that maybe that *wasn't* Randy out there. That got me thinking about the incident with me in the woods the previous night. That thing -- the black, shadowy *whatever* it is -- was able to sound just like me. Not only that, it was able to *look* like me, too. Then it hit me, *"Didn't Randy say he saw me following him in the woods before that?"*

I realized, too, that, who or whatever was out there, was only repeating back to me things Randy said to me earlier. That was, until I heard the voice scream "What in the name of--", trailing off into a muffled scream. Despite my suspicion, I couldn't just stand there any more. I know what you're probably thinking, too; *"It's a trap!"*, yeah, yeah. But I just couldn't risk the fact that that *might've ACTUALLY* been him, and now he was in some sort of danger. I broke into a sprint into the woods where I was hearing the muffled screams coming from.

I started calling out for him, "Randy?! Randy, where are you?!" I ran deeper and deeper into the woods. Despite it not even being past noon yet, the tight grouping of the trees all around me, something that's always been a distinct characteristic of the trails here in Grenview Pines, caused the area to get darker and darker the further into them I ran. "Randy?! RAN--"

I stopped when I heard Randy's laughter again. Oddly, despite being in the same general vacinity of where it'd have been coming from a minute ago, it still sounded distant. Maybe a better way of describing it would be to say that it sounded less like he was actually there, laughing, and more like I was hearing a *recording* of it. Like I said, I could tell the voice was his, but I could also tell it might not have been coming *from* him. 

I started throwing my head around frantically, trying to find either Randy or whatever his voice was coming out of. Eventually, I looked up and my blood instantly turned to solid ice. Above me, perched on a tree branch and staring down at me, was Randy. He abruptly stopped laughing and just stared at me blankly. I stood still, my heart pounding furiously, trying to punch straight through my chest. I didn't know whether to run or to try calling out to him, it, whatever. 

"R-Ran-Randy?" I asked, shuddering. 

His mouth opened, stretching a lot more than it should have, and he started laughing again and said, "Love you, too, pal!" My eyes went wide seeing this. I wanted to puke. That was his voice, *his face*, but I knew right then that *wasn't* him.

"What are you? What'd you do with Randy?" I started breathing heavily. Adrenaline was slowly filing throughout my entire body. I could feel the urge to, at any moment, either charge up the tree at the thing, choking the life out of it and demanding to know where and what the hell it'd done to my buddy or turn tail and run out of there, all the way back to my truck at the bottom of the mountain. 

I'd end up choosing the latter when its mouth opened again, this time distending the jaw so far that Randy's cheeks began tearing apart. Then, from out of the mouth, I watched two inky black stubs begin prying the jaws farther and farther apart until I saw its lumpy head poke out and look at me with its white sockets. No sooner than I opened my own mouth to scream, The thing shot out like a bullet at me from Randy's mouth. Randy's skin deflated like a balloon, draping limply over the branch. 

Through some miracle (hell, more like "Divine intervention"), I actually managed to move out of the way before it could latch onto me and I ran back towards the clearing. Like before, I heard it coming after me, right on my heels. Actually, this time, I noticed it seemed a lot faster, seeming to stay a lot closer to me than last time. I managed to break the tree line when I felt something sharp sink into my shoulder blades. This caused me to drop to one knee, crying out in pain. I felt the thing then reach one of its arm stubs around and begin trying to pry my jaws apart. I tried in vain to force them off of me. It was no use. Its grip, despite having no fingers, was strong. My jaw strained from the tension. 

Thinking quickly, I drew my hunting knife from my pocket and swung it around, successfully embedding it into one of the thing's eyes. Sure enough, this caused it to let go and I was able to get up and continue running. My pace was slower, though, with sharp pain shooting throughout my body from my shoulder blades. Fortunately, the thing must've been too weak to chase after me because I didn't hear it, or anything else, coming up behind me. Despite this, I didn't stop until I'd made it down the mountain where I'd left the truck, parked at the opening of the trail we'd originally hiked to the clearing from. 

This was four or five days ago now. I went to the doctor to have my back looked at immediately after leaving Grenview Pines. I wasn't sure what that thing used to stab me like that with, but I wasn't taking any chances that it hadn't infected me with some sort of venom or something. I remember the doctor's look of "What the fuck?!" when he saw my back. I had the same expression, too, when I saw them. Where my shoulder blades were, were now tow large dark holes that looked like someone had taken a drill to my back. Even freakier, was the fact that they didn't bleed. 

When he asked me what happened, I told him that a black bear attacked me and my friend on a hunting trip. I told him that it'd gotten Randy, that I couldn't save him. This was the same story I gave the police and the Rangers, too, the next day. As I write, they're still canvassing the mountain for his body. I hope they find it. But more than that, I hope it's actually *him* they find.

As for me, well, I've been at home. I've felt awful since I left Grenview Pines. Those wounds on my back constantly burn and I feel like the inside of me is sort of turning into jelly. I was up all through last night throwing up, and it hadn't gotten any better this morning. But that's not even the part that's scaring me now; the reason I'm now writing this.

See, It was this morning, when I tried to turn on the TV to take my mind off of how sick I was feeling, that the morning show came on. As they were talking, for whatever reason, I felt somehow forced to open my mouth and start repeating them. The worst part was, *I was sounding just like them!*

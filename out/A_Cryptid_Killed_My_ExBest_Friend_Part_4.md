&#x200B;

This post will detail Kelly’s attempt to interview Dana Maxwell, George Maxwell’s wife. The events of which were told to me a few days after I went to see Floyd. She was hesitant to relay the details right away and I can see why. By god I can. When she finally did work up the courage to tell me, we sat across from each other and she fidgeted a little before beginning.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I went over to their house but…”

&#x200B;

“Let me guess. Someone else was living there?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I asked around the neighborhood and eventually I did get an answer of her whereabouts.”

&#x200B;

“And that would be?”

&#x200B;

“She’s dead.”

&#x200B;

“What?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was taken aback. That isn’t to say I was expecting to hear Dana was doing well exactly, just compared to Floyd. Then again, maybe death would’ve been a mercy for him.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How’d she die?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The look she gave told me the answer to the question. I closed my eyes.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Where did it kill her?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly explained that she was found dead in her town’s mental hospital.  The way she came about this information was from the town librarian.  Through idle chit-chat, she learned that his name was Isaac. Then she got onto a more serious subject.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I asked him how long he’d been working there and when he told me since 2010, I asked him about the Maxwells.”

&#x200B;

“And what did he say?”

&#x200B;

“It’s like he’d been expecting someone to ask him about it. He told me to wait until everyone else had left.”

&#x200B;

“He wanted to be alone with you and you just went along with it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly gave me the kind of stare that makes someone feel as though they’re shrinking.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“The man has to be in his seventies, Neil. Besides, he seemed nice.”

&#x200B;

“So what all did you learn from him?”

&#x200B;

“That he was friends with both the Maxwells and Turners. He said it was a shame what happened to them.  I told him about…Jake.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There was a cold pause between us before she continued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“He told me that he was sorry and that if it would bring me closure, he would help how ever he could. I told him about how you were going to see Floyd and that I was trying to find  Dana.”

&#x200B;

“And that’s when he told you what happened to her?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This was when Isaac mentioned the mental hospital where Dana was committed to. He also instructed Kelly to ask for a nurse by the name of Margaret. Apparently, she owed him a favor from way back.  She found her at the front desk. I asked Kelly what she was like.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The description she gave of her was that of someone worn out. Given her profession, that isn’t surprising.

&#x200B;

“You must be Kelly,” She said.

&#x200B;

“Did Isaac call you?”

&#x200B;

“He did and to be honest, I would turn and leave right now if I were you, but I know you won’t so I’ll tell you to wait until my shift is over in an hour. Then I can answer any questions you have about Dana Maxwell.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly shifted uncomfortably in her chair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think there may be something more going on with that place than Dana. I got a bad feeling from it, Neil.”

&#x200B;

“Of course you did. It’s a mental hospital. Last I checked they aren’t exactly pleasant.”

&#x200B;

“This was different. Trust me. I would know.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Now I was the one uncomfortably shifting in my chair.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah, I guess you would,” I said, rubbing the back of my neck and glancing at the floor before focusing my gaze back on her. “But what do you mean exactly?”

&#x200B;

“I don’t know how to explain it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She thought for a moment, trying to find the right words.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It’s like it had more…Personality.”

&#x200B;

“Weird.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I really didn’t know how else to respond.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Yeah,” Kelly continued. “Anyway, when Margaret got off her shift, she led me to her car. Then told me to get in.”

&#x200B;

“Why?”

&#x200B;

“More privacy.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The air took on a certain stillness between the two of them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Ask away,” Margaret said in the tone of someone wanting to get something over with.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly briefly considered what the best question to ask first would be.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I guess the first thing I want to know is what was she like?”

&#x200B;

“Before or after she became our patient?”

&#x200B;

“Both.”

&#x200B;

“Well, she didn’t have any history of mental problems. Although, when it came to George, she did worry which was understandable. Can you open the glove compartment for me?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Inside was a flask. Kelly stared at her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I only have a little to take off  the edge.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She shrugged and handed it to Margaret who took a quick swig of it while being asked another question.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did you know her?”

&#x200B;

“We talked sometimes, but I’d never describe us as friends.”

&#x200B;

“I see. By the way, just out of curiosity, what exactly is your relationship with Isaac?”

&#x200B;

“He helped me on my feet and gave me a job at the library while I was still in school.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She closed her eyes and leaned back.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“There are days when I wish I chose that career instead.”

&#x200B;

“Then why didn’t you?”

&#x200B;

“I wanted to help people, but that job takes a toll on you. Do you know how many things I’ve seen in there I wish I could forget?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Part of Kelly wanted her to elaborate. The other part figured it was best left unknown. I concur with that sentiment.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Was Dana the worst?”

&#x200B;

“By far and that’s saying a lot. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone go from healthy to unwell as fast as she did. I saw her at Geroge’s funeral.”

&#x200B;

“You were there?”

&#x200B;

“Obviously. He was a good man and I wanted to pay my respects. Dana was a strong woman and she tried to keep it together during the service, but it was hard for her. It was painful to see her cry during the eulogy. Poor woman.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly silently drummed her fingers on the dashboard.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I think I can relate. When did you notice something was off with her? Outside of losing Geroge I mean.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret searched her memory for the closest answer.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’d say over a month probably. I heard through the grapevine that people were noticing that she was more jittery. At first, it was rumored that she was on something. Then after talking with her, we thought George’s death was the cause and that it had taken more of a toll on her than we thought.”

&#x200B;

“Did she come to your hospital willingly?”

&#x200B;

“Not exactly. Some of her neighbors heard her screaming one night. According to them, she came running out of her home with cuts all over the front of her body. She kept yelling to keep something away from her.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly felt herself get tense. I did as well while she told this to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Did they see anything chasing her?”

&#x200B;

“No, which is why she was committed. We assumed that she did it to herself. She kept insisting and fighting us every step of the way. If only we knew the truth.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

A hint of guilt entered Margaret’s voice as she continued.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Only a week after she became our patient did we begin to have issues.”

&#x200B;

“What kind?”

&#x200B;

“She kept having episodes and waking up in the middle of the night, screaming with cuts on her. We always thoroughly check patients, especially ones like her, and we couldn’t find anything she could’ve done that with. On the off chance, we also checked the other patients, and still nothing.”

&#x200B;

“Was that when you started thinking the cause may have been something else? Something unusual?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret’s grip around her flask tightened and Kelly could feel herself catching the tension that was coming off of her as she took another swig.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I wasn’t letting my mind go there. When you’ve worked in my profession for a while you tend to keep yourself from having those kinds of thoughts. Otherwise, you might go from nurse to patient. However, at some point things become undeniable.”

&#x200B;

“And when was that point for you?”

&#x200B;

“We thought it would be best for her to be isolated from the other patients and monitored. Of course, we only do that in extreme cases. We made sure to monitor Dana constantly and yet…”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret was having trouble getting the words out as if she still couldn’t quite believe them.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“You kept finding her injured?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

She nodded.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“That’s when I began to think there was something more going on.”

&#x200B;

“The hospital has security cameras. Doesn’t it? Did you ever check them to find out anything?”

&#x200B;

“Of course. Unfortunately, it didn’t help.  We viewed the footage for those nights and it looked normal at first. Then for some reason, the video would cut out for a bit before coming back on.”

&#x200B;

“What about the audio?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret swallowed a lump in her throat.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was still functional.”

&#x200B;

“And what did you hear from it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Despite being afraid of what the answer might be, Kelly knew she needed all the details.  I felt the same way talking to Gene.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“She was shrieking for something to keep away from her and there was this high-pitched laughing. We thought it was, well, Dana talking to herself. Looking back, I don’t know how I thought that. It sounded nothing like her. I guess I just convinced myself it did.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What Margaret said next has given us some insight into how this creature thinks and it’s truly disturbing.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It would happen every night. Staff would hear her screaming bloody murder and rush in only to find her alone with the same cuts as before.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

This has given us some confusion. The shapeshifter was fine being on camera when it came to Jake so why wasn’t it with Dana? Maybe it was afraid of being interrupted?  Whatever the case, I can only imagine how horrified either of them must have been.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“How long did this continue?”

&#x200B;

“Eight days. There was talk from doctors about transferring her. Try as we might, we were stumped so we thought a better-equipped hospital would be able to figure out how these things were happening.”

&#x200B;

“Who found her?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly already knew the answer to that question before she asked it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Me. I was bringing breakfast to her room. The first thing I noticed when I opened the door, was the smell. It was still dark in the room so I couldn’t see anything. Then I turned on the lights. God, I wish I didn’t.  I couldn’t even process what I was seeing.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret explained that Dana’s head was the only part of her body that could still be made out. The rest of her was described as resembling bloody shredded beef.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I screamed and ran out of the room. I must’ve fainted because I found myself in one of our beds later. I was lashing out and they actually had to sedate me. Eventually, I calmed down, but I was still inconsolable. Honestly, I nearly quit because of that.”

&#x200B;

“Why didn’t you?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret took yet another albeit much longer swig from her flask.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I’m not sure exactly. I guess something inside just told me I need to keep going.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

If that were me, I would never be able to go back to that place again. If it weren't for my personal reasons, there’s no way in hell I would be trying to do all this.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“What was the official story?”

&#x200B;

“It was ruled as a suicide. You know, I laughed when I heard that. Don’t get me wrong. I understood why they couldn’t tell the truth. It was just that with all the stress I was under, I snapped again. I won’t lie. It felt good to let it all out. Although, I did scare the other nurses. I was made to take some time off after that. Now, I’ve told you all I know so tell me, do you know who did it?”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly wasn’t hesitant. Margaret pressed her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Even with everything you’ve seen, it’ll be hard for you to believe this.”

&#x200B;

“At this point, I’m not sure what to believe so try me.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly told her about the shapeshifter. Margaret listened, slowly becoming more horrified as she heard more details.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“At least I know now. Thank you.”

&#x200B;

“You’re welcome. There’s one more thing I need to ask.”

&#x200B;

“Go ahead.”

&#x200B;

“Did you notice anything strange during your time off? Any animals acting unusual maybe?”

&#x200B;

“Actually, yes.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What Margaret saw occurred the day prior to her resuming her job.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“It was late and I was on my way home from the store when a deer ran across the street.”

&#x200B;

“That sounds pretty normal.”

&#x200B;

“On its hind legs.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly briefly fell silent before speaking again.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“So what did you do?”

&#x200B;

“Nothing. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, so I ignored it and kept going. Are you going to say that it was the thing that killed Dana?”

&#x200B;

“I think that’s the case, yes.”

“And I was almost seen by it.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Margaret shuddered. If I was there instead of her and that godforsaken thing crossed in front of my car, I might’ve gotten myself into a wreck.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“I won’t lie, “ she continued. “Talking about this has brought back some really bad memories. In a way, though, I’m glad we had this conversation. It felt good to talk to someone else who could relate to what I went through.”

&#x200B;

“Same here. Thank you for your time.”

&#x200B;

“It’s not a problem and sorry about Jake.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Kelly gave her a weak smile.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

“Thanks.”

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And then she left. The next interview is going to be a difficult one and I don’t think I’ll be able to handle it alone. Therefore, I’m going to talk to Kelly about coming along. I’ll share what we learn from them in my next post. Hopefully, I’ll be able to sleep without dreaming about that horrifying thing running [across](https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesFromRose/) the [road.](https://twitter.com/RoseBlack2222)

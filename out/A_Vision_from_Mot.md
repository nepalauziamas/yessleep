I was about 18 or 19 and in the Navy around the time my third eye was activated, story for another time. Didn't really believe in the paranormal until that day. Not important to the story I'm about to tell outside of the fact that I can see, hear, and sense things that people aren't really meant to. Took a while to get used to. Anyways...

Fast forward 1 year. Im training on a reactor over in [redacted]. I came home from work after a 14 hour shift and was ready to sleep. I stepped out of my car and saw an entity standing in front of the front door of my house.

Now the way I can describe how and what I see can be difficult, as it's not visual. It's like having a method of seeing that's not quite physical. Kind of like seeing with eyes in another dimension. I can extend my spirit within a certain radius and know what's in the area. What I "see" is the shape of a man, that I know wasn't actually a man. 

I freeze. Almost felt like it in the literal sense, as my body felt a sharp sting of ice like a shard just pierced through my entire being. Up to this point I have only seen the spirits of the dead, but this wasn't a spirit.

It was looking at me. It *waited* for me. I could tell it knew I can see it. We stood in silence for what seemed like an eternity but all in all it was probably like 30 seconds

I coughed and rasped and finally managed to speak, "Who the fuck are *you*?"

My roommate opened the front door. "Dude you gonna come in or what? It's below freezing." I guess he saw me outside standing in the cold. Hopefully didn't see me talking to no one like a crazy person. 

"Yeah sorry I zoned out" I was tired. Maybe it was nothing. Well I knew it was something but was too tired to think anymore of it. It was gone.

I went upstairs to my room to go to sleep. I laid down on my back and begin to meditate. As that's how I learned how to shut off my third eye. I usually do it while working or while falling asleep. I focus on a single point and create a spiritual barrier around it. It was pretty important to do it when I sleep because my spirit gets yanked and it wakes me up. Used to be a problem. I probably sound like a crazy person talking about it but it is what it is. I'm a man of science and I found what works best for me after some experimentation and suggestions.

I set up my barrier and fell asleep fast but this night was different. The entity ripped opened my barrier and rushed into my room. I woke up and opened my eyes and convulsed with excruciating pain in my entire body. It went under my bed and then stabbed its way into my body through my mid-back and out my belly.

I wake up. But not in the normal sense. I was laying on the floor in what seemed like an empty version of my bedroom. Was I actually asleep? I stood up and I see an old bald man with a nice suit. Waiting for me. He spoke, not in English but in some otherworldly language. But somehow I understood every word he was saying.

"Hello, my name is Mot, I didn't mean to startle you. I only need you to listen to what I say for now."

I began to speak, not in English but strangely also in the same out-of-this-world language. Not knowing the language, but I knew what I was saying.

"I am so confused. Why did you come to me? What language is this?"

"I only come to you because you can sense me. As did your mother. As did your grandmother. As did her father. As did his mother, following back for generations. Your line has been damned to understand death. But only one in each generation. You are speaking glossolalia. I will answer more questions another time. I must begin to inform you of the passings."

This somehow felt like destiny, like I was meant to meet Mot. Yet I was still so confused.

"Are you a friend or are you dangerous?"

That question didn't matter, not yet. Mot just started speaking REALLY fast in this glossolalia. At first I thought it was nonsense. But as I tried to catch up and tune in on with what he was saying, my heart sank and every emotion was shoved into me at once. The only thing that made sense was the insane hysteria that I was overwhelmed with. Then I was able to understand everything Mot said. 

It was just a list of names and causes of death. But it wasn't any specific names. It was EVERYONE in the world.

"[name redacted] cause of death: natural"

"[name redacted] cause of death: natural"

"[name redacted] cause of death: murdered"

"[name redacted] cause of death: sepsis"

Many names kept coming. A lot of natural deaths and death from illness but the occasional came in for murder, accidents, overdosing on drugs, heart failure, any death you can think of. Mot spoke quickly but I caught them all. At the end of it Mot paused for a minute.

"You have to know, as it will be important on judgment day. Before I take my leave, I have to ask. May I borrow a part of you? I must at least have your eyes"

I felt inclined to give it to him but waited for my hysteria to die down. I waited a few hours in this room with him, trying to suppress my emotions so that I can think clearly. This entire time he stared and waited patiently while I was angry, while I was crying, while I was laughing. I had lost my mind and I couldn't understand it. Eventually I finally managed to calm down and I was ready to answer.

"Why do you need my eyes? The answer is 'no' until I understand the question better."

"Very well. Until next time".

I woke up. Like actually awake. I was an hour late to work that morning. 

That was the first time I spoke to Mot and it became a reoccurring dream. It would be the same order: banter, questions, list of deaths, and ending with Mot asking to borrow a part of my body while I was in hysteria. Eventually I was able to interact with him while awake. Mot became a long term acquaintance of mine and I was able to ask him more questions over time.

I've come to understand a few things: He is not friendly, but he is not an enemy. He is an angel of death, and there are more entities like him. He is particularly fond of my family because of a deal he made with an ancestor of mine thousands of years ago. My purpose is to keep him company and to remember some of the names burned into my memory for judgment day. I will die of heart failure, as part of the deal with my ancestor, but Mot is forbidden from telling me when that day is. I will have a son, and Mot will leave me and will accompany him when the time comes, but I cannot warn or talk to my son about Mot or he will die of heart failure within the year. For that same reason my mother refuses to talk to me about him when I asked her about Mot. There was a time when the name of my little brother came up and I asked if I can change it. It was too late and unfortunately it was how I heard about my brother before my dad and my older brother called me. It was always the case when it's the name of someone I recognized. It's always too late.

I'm 29 now and just recently left the Navy. I've been acquainted with Mot for about a decade. Last week I met with him again while hiking on a trail near [redacted]. Same routine. We talked for a bit and he gave me another list of deaths. The question came. "I've waited quite a while and I will continue to ask: may I borrow your eyes? The path to understanding will come when you allow this."

I've always wanted to say "yes" for some reason but held back for so long to remain cautious. I kept my hysteria buried but my curiosity got the better of me.

"Will you return them?"

Mot floated up a few feet and his head began to distort. A face grew out each corner of his head and many limbs started to pierce his suit and grow out of his body. He rasped out an answer from every face in anger "I ALWAYS RETURN WHAT DOESN'T BELONG TO ME YOU *FUCKING* MORTAL. DO NOT DOUBT ME."

Got to be honest, I nearly had a heart attack because I was absolutely terrified. But I knew he was telling the truth and was still curious. I waited a minute to think. Mot slowly reverted back to his normal form. The suit remained all torn.

I felt settled and overcome with curiosity, "You can borrow my eyes"

I can still hear multiple voices as he responded. "Thank you, [name redacted], you'll come to understand how important this is. You will see it."

I started to feel out of place and pulled my laptop out of my backpack (Yes, I took a lap top out hiking with me, I write music). I realized what I had to do and meditated. I focused on a point and attempted to set up my barrier, but felt my barrier merge into the universe. I still had control of my physical form began to type out my thoughts as I fell into a trance.

"All becomes one. One becomes all. 'I' am 'We', as so we are all one in existence. There is a place that it comes down to. The place stands still but shifts around itself. It can be seen from all planes but exists in between. Both sides of every coin. It is endlessly reflected. You sit still, but you are at the same time shifting. 

"It's a ticker. Nothing ever moved but each tick will place you in another plane. Multiple realities experienced. We see all that we become and become all that we see. Each corner of the neverending room of mirrors. We reside because existence is above and below us. Yet we exist in our place.

"Its okay to exist. The understanding must never end though. 

"We must be both guilty and proud of everything that we are.

"We are time. We are space. We are matter. We are energy. This is our reality. And it's okay.

"All emotions can be felt in unison. 

"It's okay to be angry. Its okay to forgive.

"It's okay to be happy. It's okay to feel sad.

"This universe is beyond us and we must expand with the universe. Never ending. It must never end. 

"Math is a deity. Physics is the one true pursuit to understanding.

"To 'be' is to be fluid with all existence. It transcends every nature of comprehension. All time becomes one and space will collide to that single point. The place of focus. We will not exist in that place itself, but it will exist as a reflection of ourself in between the planes. 

"Each infinite number of planes will exist as a reflection of possibilities.

"Each and every single person in this reality exists with purpose. Between atrocities and charity, minuscule or greatness. We define life.

"The purpose of life is to never stop the pursuit of knowledge, as the universe will continue shifting. Life must understand how to remain in the universe, as we are one with it. 

"The place will not move. We must reach out toward it but we will never be able to touch it. Seek all planes and remain. Possibilities are endless and it will become more efficient as we explore multiple planes at once. 

"The ticker must continue. Shift between planes and remain in place. The planes will reveal itself. The in-between will show you the glimpse of the place. The reason we exist."

I came to and I was just sitting with my laptop on my lap on this trail. I think I had merged into Mot but I am whole with myself again. Mot had left me. I read these notes and all I can think is, "Holy shit I'm a fucking crazy person". 

Something definitely feels different though. I don't think Mot will visit me anymore. I finished my hike and started driving home. I stopped for gas and I took a look at my phone and saw that I had a text from my wife.

"I'm pregnant"

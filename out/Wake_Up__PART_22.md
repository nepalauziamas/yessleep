Well, you're hearing from me, but it's been a while, things didn't go well, at all. And just remember, my son likes the number seven...15 days ago, I had a horrible, very lucid day dream, where my Brother-In-Law became some monster, some being, and attacked everyone. And when I woke up, it was 30 minutes before the destined disaster time, I left you guys off at 2:56 PM, now I definitely owe you all the update I promised.

Let's rewind to 2:30pm when I woke up from the nightmare. It was a bright, sunny day in Fresno, California. Me, my wife, and our two kids decided to host a party to get our family back together, and after a long party, at 2:28pm, we started playing board games, we began with a Battleship tournament. The disaster took place at 3:01pm exactly, no seconds, milliseconds, or anything remaining.

In part one I made, you may remember my brother walking into the house, where my nephew, Jordan, was in the bathroom, now, during the day dream/day-mare, Jordan came running out with a huge gash on his leg, from what looked like a knife at the time, but ended up being my brother-in-law's hellish form. Instead, things were worse.

"YES!" - Annie yelped out as she won the tournament, so she got to pick her meal first for dinner. "Good game Annie." - My brother-in-law, Henry, grabbed her hand firmly, and shook it. He had some kind of, devil look in his eyes, some maniacal look, I knew things would go bad, and we had exactly 60 seconds, or so I thought.3:01pm had ticked over, nothing had happened, I don't know what was wrong with me, I should have told everyone sooner about the nightmare, I could have stopped him. It was too late, by the time I remembered, I had yelled for everyone to get over the fence, it was too late. Shrieking, banging, human yells came from inside the house. Just like the nightmare, me and my dad both grabbed something to murder the ever loving s\*\*\* out of whatever was inside my house, but it wasn't anything huge, 20 feet tall like last time. It was Henry, and Jordan, both covered in blood, Jordan screaming, without any legs.

My jaw dropped, my eyes widened, Henry was normal. Except the fact he had a giant butchers knife, and multiple smaller knives, my dad told me to run.

"EVERBODY OVER THE DAMN FENCE! NOW!" - I screamed running out of the house.

"Get the kids over first!" - One of my siblings yelled.

I watched as a scuffle to get everyone over was attempted, but I altered something, because in the day-dream, everybody rushed because they heard my urgency, but, something this time happened, making them feel a bit less worried. And whatever I did wrong this time, I regret, for my whole life. My dad was screaming, and Henry too, but it was too late, Henry had came out with more knives, and he had a few in my dad's chest, and Jordan w cas still lying there, screaming in the kitchen.

The moment everyone saw Henry, they ran, hurried over the fence. And then it happened. Henry aimed for all of his siblings first, so my brothers and sisters-in-laws. He got all of them, most took one throw. Three deaths, including Henry's wife, Amy.

He then aimed for two of my most prized possessions to my life, my mom and Lucy. Lucy died at age seven, she would have made it to eight in only a month, but after her leg was severed from a huge knife, she dropped dead within minutes from blood loss. It was my mom next, who saw Lucy get murdered before so many children's and people's eyes, she didn't hesitate. And this message on the news blinds my mind forever.

"Violet Lunder, age 61, the mother of David Lunder, is your seventh victim today, as she and four other adults rushed the psychopath killer, Henry Denton, all five adults died due to vicious stab wounds, bringing our death count to two kids, and six adults, the other seven made it out alive. Henry Denton was found dead due to a knife through the jaw, making the tally seven adults, with a total of nine victims in this bloody and painful night."

I saw my family, all my siblings, and my mom, rushing this psycho, and so I kept helping the kids over, the screams of Jordan had stopped after a whole four minutes. Kurt and Ross were the final two over the fence, Kurt, my nephew, who was thirteen, helped young four year old Ross over the fence. I saw my mom, Rachel, and Carter still fighting with Henry, I stared in horror, as Bill and Abigail, two of my siblings, lay there crying in agony on the floor.

And this is the part where I end up in the hospital. I stare at my poor Lucy, who's eyes barely moved, as her last life drained from her. I cried, but I had to stop, I quickly got up and took the knife out of my daughter's legs, and I rushed at Henry. 30 feet separated me and this ba\*tard

Everything felt slower, I watched him ram a knife into the stomach of my mother, I watched him punch my brother Carter's face so hard, multiple teeth came out, then he kicked Rachel away, killing her after lodging her into the knife the fell on the ground earlier in the battle. Carter tried to get up, same with my mother, sadly she didn't make it, nor did Carter. 15 feet

My mother died after she pulled the knife out to try and stab Henry, but he threw the knife from her hand, forcing her to the ground, where she lay, in agony, and pain. Carter tried to get up as well, wiping blood from his bloody face, but Henry, just stamped Carter's head into the ground, and he was looking away from me. 3 feet.

I screamed. 2 feet.

Henry whipped around. 1 foot.

I slammed a knife into Henry's face, right in his mouth, I then would land on a knife he had dropped, it stabbed straight into my leg, right into the bone. I would scream in pain. I lay there, drifting in and out for 30 seconds, I looked over at Lucy, who's body was limp against a fence post, I would turn my eyes barely to look at Henry, he was gone.

I woke up 11 days later from a coma. All five of the surviving children, Ross, Kurt, Annie, Mason, and my son Jacob. Three doctors and one officer were in my room. I felt for my leg, but felt nothing. Then one doctor said something.

"We had to amputate it, it had too much damage, there was no sign for repair."

"S\*it." - Was the only word I could muster up energy to say.

As I said that, I heard a gasp, my head shot to the right. "ROSITA!" I yelled. She had climbed over the fence, and she had helped the kids call 911, they thought I was dead. I then looked to my left, where I saw another bed, and someone I didn't expect to ever see. Jordan, but he wasn't moving, and he looked horrible, also without legs.

"We had to amputate him too, it's not likely he'll ever wake up." - The same doctor said.

5 days passed, to today, I had finally found some prosthetic legs, so the doctors helped me learn to walk with them for the past two days, and I think I have a good hang of it. They're gonna let me go soon, I just finished changing, and I was handed adoption papers, for four kids, and I signed them, I couldn't let my nieces and nephews I loved so much about go to an orphanage.

I set up dates with a therapist, as I am never going to be able to recover from that, but, I hope you all learn this lesson. "If you feel something is wrong, don't do it." I say this, because I knew something was wrong, but I never told anyone to leave, and now I feel that I costed eight lives. I don't count Henry as a life, he is a lifeless, piece of s\*it, who deserves his spot I reserved for him in hell. I plan to visit Lucy's grave when I get let out, and then Jordan's, then Carter's, and everyone else who died.

Goodbye - David Lunder

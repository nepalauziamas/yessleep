My family lives in a small town in Canada, you rarely hear any crime happening within a 100km radius but for some reason our family keeps getting these weird occurrences that have happened far apart from each other but over the span of 5 years.

The first thing was back in late 2017 when my dad got up early for work like usual. The sun was barley lighting the town but it was light enough that you could still see objects. Anyway my dad spotted this man hanging around and pacing back and forth around 10 times out by our backyard fence. but it was probably nothing and my family brushed it off.  

the second thing happened in 2018 when our house was egged, we had an idea who it was because my brother recently broke up with a pretty crazy girl, but we can't prove it so my mom installed cameras all around our house.

the 3rd occurrence happened a few weeks after we got egged my mom woke up to find our truck door open with our glove box all askew and it looked like it had been ripped apart. whoever it was stole a GPS and a bottle of hand sanitizer for some reason. Again we had no idea who it was but it had just snowed and my brother pointed out small footprints leading to the truck.

the 4th occurrence happened in early 2020 when my mom was checking our security cam footage like she always does when a video of a white ford pulling up to our house. 3 people jumped out and went into the backyard, we had no clue who these people were but they just searched the backyard for things to steal and sell maybe? anyway this made my mom and dad install motion sensor lights.

and the most recent is the most strange. it happened about an hour ago when me, my mom and my brother were sitting talking when my brother pointed out that there was a fire in our fire pit. There is currently a fire ban were I live so it was very strange. we thought it was our dad but he was sleeping. And then when we asked our other brother he had no clue what we were talking about. my dad put it out with a hose to discover a burnt shirt. we couldn't make out the brand of the shirt because the fire had destroyed most of it. but it was also doused in gasoline. but when my mom checked our cameras there was squat. No footage of anything, no motion sensor, no nothing. So someone doused a shirt in gasoline lit it on fire in our fire pit. Its very bizarre. Our family sat down discussing anyone we might've pissed off but no one came to us.

was it some asshole just messing with us? 

Was it a threat? 

Is someone planning something sinister?

I don't know but I can't sleep now that's for sure.

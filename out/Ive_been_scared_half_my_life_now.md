This is my first time here, sorry if my storytelling skills are a little rusty, I don't write often but I need to get this out.

I guess I should start from the beginning to now. My heart is pounding as I speak so sorry if this isn't pleasant to read.

This happened when I was about eleven, twelve, or somewhere around my pre-teen years. It's hard to remember when my brain tries to block everything out.

I'm about sixteen now, and I'm absolutely fucking terrified about what's happening.

When I was a pre-teen, everything in my life was as normal as a lower class kids life could be. Lacking birthday parties, getting expensive gifts once in a blue moon, sitting in my room and scrolling around my new phone I begged my parents for. Friends, nosy parents, watching stuff I wasn't supposed to.

Honestly, I don't remember much from the night of happened, but I'll try to give a quick rundown of what went down the night of that stupid August 11th. I hate that date to this day and it's upcoming for me now.d

I was at my friend's house I believe, and we were just hanging out. My friend was thirteen, so she had already had her birthday a few months before this. We met through mutual friends and hit it off I guess, since she was like my older sister. She was one of my best friends.

Her name was plain, just Velivia. I used to think it was ugly, honestly, it reminded me of Velveeta Mac and Cheese, so I used to tease her about it. I honestly regret it now, I wish I could have been a little kinder, but I can't blame myself too much since I was just an ignorant kid.

Velivia said we should go for a walk that night, since she was bored or something, and so for a while we were just walking outside. This is where it gets blurry, I think because she made me enter flight or fight mode, and as a pre-teen it's always going to be flight.

We had just got back to her house when she told me to go inside. Her voice was hard, the same way an older sister would demand her little brother get his ass inside. I glanced at her in confusion, asking her what was wrong. She didn't reply to me, instead shoving me harshly towards the front of the house before she turned around.

I screamed, asking her what she was doing, but she just told me to go inside that instant. I remember it still, the primal fear I felt when she began to walk away and leaving me in the front of her house. She wasn't coming with me and I don't know why, but I was filled with dread.

I had ran inside immediately, diving into her bedroom and closing the door, trying to catch my breath as I imagined what she was doing. The cold tone of her voice still haunts me, she was insistent I left and now I wish I hadn't. Maybe I could have done something, convinced her to come with me, but I was still just a little boy.

After about an hour of sitting in my friends room, I guess she hasn't returned so I ran to her sleeping parents with tears in my eyes. I remember because I was so worried and scared, so despite my anxiety I slammed open their door and screamed that Velivia was missing, and they woke immediately.

Everything else is lost to me, mostly a blur from what I remember. I was crying, her parents were screaming at each other as one searched the block with the car, and one was calling the police as she asked me what was going on. I was terrified that they would be angry, or blame me, but they didn't say anything bad to me, instead her mom hugged me and told me it's not my fault she's gone.

The only thing I remember with clarity that night is her mom telling me that their family was constantly followed by, something. I don't remember what she told me it was, but that when they turned into teens, they weren't supposed to follow the person trying to lead them. She said it was a rule, but she probably got worried about me and tried to chase it off or scare it. 

After that, her parents took me home after I was questioned by the police. I told my parents everything, crying because they told me she would probably never be found. My family was close with her family, and they didn't look shocked, so they must have known. They must have known this could have happened and they told me nothing, because I guess they didn't want to scare me.

That's when I found out we were related. It was a surprise, because I never knew until that moment. Apparently we shared grandparents, my mom and her mom were sisters, and so we were cousins. I guess we just never knew because the family never does gatherings or anything of the sort, so we didn't meet often until I got to school.

That's when I realized I had to worry. I was going to turn thirteen and I was scared the same thing would happen to me. That a figure would show up and I would be so blinded by courage I was going to lead myself right into the same fate.

I had lived the rest of my life in fear. I'm sitting here writing this and I still can't get over the unswallowable lump in my throat.

They had actually found my friend at some point, a month later. It was her body to be more precise, and I blocked out the entire memory of the funeral. It was a closed casket one, and I never dared ask what happened to her. I have an idea, but it might be too gruesome to let myself write it.

For the years after until now, I never saw a figure following me or anything of the sort, but I have seen my friend again. She looked perfectly normal whenever I caught a glimpse, or her voice sounded warm when she told me to turn around and go home that day.

I didn't know why I was seeing her, but I figured it was my mind playing tricks on me from guilt of letting it happen. I figured it was my gut telling me to leave the place, not Velivia. How could it be her? Either way I took the warning and always left.

Next thing I assumed was that she was a ghost, after it happened too many times to explain it rationally. How would my brain make me scared of public areas? It was a bittersweet thought, that she was watching me and helping me even in the after life, just as big sisters do.

That was until now. Shit, I think it's nice to tell you guys my fingers are shaking right now.

I saw something yesterday and I'm about to piss my pants writing this. I can't explain to you guys the fear I'm feeling right now, but writing down those memories has been the opposite of helpful. I can't even formulate the words to explain that I'm shitting myself and I'm so scared since I don't want to tell my parents.

Yesterday I was just strolling around when I heard Velivia's voice again. It didn't scare me anymore when I heard that warm, yet nearly non-existent voice whisper in my ear, except this time it was cold again. Like the same night she disappeared, it was demanding, angry, telling me to turn around and run.

I was confused, since I was on a public road surrounded by homes, until I saw it.

A black figure was walking towards me. It was sunset so I could barely see, but I knew it was coming to me and that if I didn't haul ass that it was going to get me. I was worried before about being too courageous, but now I realize Velivia was much braver than I was, because it was immediate flight mode.

I bolted after that, since I still saw the figure watching me, almost beckoning me forward. It was a gravitational pull if I'm going to make it explainable to people who think I'm a shit show right now, like it was begging me to go forward.

Of course I'm a coward, so I ran home and last night I couldn't sleep at all. I'm so tired right now. I can't tell my parents in fear they'd keep me locked up at home, so I'm writing it here, but I'm starting to think it's better to be put behind bars. I've heard of this subreddit so I figured it was a good place to share my story before I fucking die, so maybe others can know it's a bad idea to listen to the instinct to go forward.

I don't understand what's going on right now, so sorry if this is a mess. Why my family, why her, why me? Who the hell are these people and why does no one have an explanation for it? Did we do something, are we cursed?

I don't know. I hear ghosts, things are after me, and it's dark right now. I'm scared it's going to come through my window one day and I really just want people to tell me I'm crazy. Please tell me I'm crazy and that I'm okay before I lose my mind. I'll try to do updates about what's going on, but I'm so scared there's going to be something to update about.

If I see that fucker again, I swear I'll throw a spear at it. Throw my phone, throw a stick, fucking anything to get it away from me. This isn't fair.

Please God help me, I swear I'll atone for my sins if you just let me never see that piece of shit again. I haven't felt safe in five years and I just want to feel okay. I don't have many friends, I'm about to fail highschool, and a good idea to me is killing myself. I should end this before it does it for me, right?

That's stupid, so I'm kidding. Mostly. It's a last resort. I'm so scared and now seeing my best friend is like a bad omen. Please someone help me.

As I'm sure those of you who play video games are aware - there is a "mod" that allows for Skyrim multiplayer. Nowadays the process is almost seamless and the mod works well enough which is why my friend asked if I wanted to play through the game with him once again.

I've got every achievement in Skyrim on three platforms in the past; Xbox 360, PS4 and PC. So naturally I wouldn't want to play through it without some difference. However, I WAS willing to play it again since I would have a friend to join me on the adventure. Luckily we were able to spice things up with a few  "choice" mods, so all in all; it was looking to be a great summer of gaming.

My friend Stevie figured out how to set up a private server and I eagerly joined. We had the alternate start mod which allowed for us to opt out of the vanilla Skyrim intro sequence in favor of a more unique beginning. I chose to wake up in the forest as a hunter (I spawned in the Rift) who was currently camping and he chose to start in a jail cell.

Before we knew it, he had broken out and escaped the city. We met up outside of Riverwood and discussed our goals and what things we desired to collect. Unfortunately, we ran into a few crashes (which was to be expected) but eventually everything sorted itself out. We had installed a few quest-based mods as well that offered a plethora of new and powerful weapons each of us wished to acquire. We were both very excited.

There was some rudimentary questing we went through like a portion of the main quest up to High Hrothgar but after that we diverted and chose to ignore the allure of Jurgen Windcallers Horn. 

After a short jaunt back to Whiterun, a strange man approached us speaking about how bandits stole his precious family heirloom. He wanted us to get it back and in turn he would provide the map to a supposedly "ancient" treasure of renown.

There was nothing to lose and with no time to spare, we set off. 

The map marker suggested that the bandits were held up in a new cave (added by a mod) somewhere between Morthal and Solitude. We soon found it and commenced what most Skyrim players do best - killing mercilessly. I won't say we didn't enjoy it because these bandits were hoarding much more than that heirloom. In fact; they had piles of gold stacked to the ceiling! One room in particular even had a diamond the size of an apple!

Needless to say, we were off to a good start.

When we had finished pillaging the entire cave system, the last bandit alive said something that I thought was quite odd. As Stevie was about to bring down his sword, the bandit held his hands up. He was shaking and then subtitles appeared saying, "Wait! Please don't kill me… I have a family and I don't belong here! We’re not normal, we’re alive!"

There wasn't any more dialogue after that and Stevie killed him without question. Then a silence followed before he said, "That was weird."

"Yeah, I've never seen that before."

"Well, anyway - let's get this thing back to that guy." He said in disregard.

"Lead the way!"

I turned for one last look at the bandit and couldn't help noticing the solemn expression on his face.

We fast-traveled back to the outskirts of Whiterun, but we couldn't find the man who had given us the quest. We looked diligently around the area, up and down the roads and even inside the city itself. He was nowhere to be found and there wasn't even a quest marker on the map.

Then, something incredibly strange happened.

A guard approached us and said a line of dialogue I’ve never heard before; it was something like, "You won't find him here. You better move along because this will only lead to trouble." I wasn't given an option to respond and when Stevie tried to talk to him, the guard wouldn't say a thing.

We continued searching the roads of Whiterun for at least an hour before deciding that the quest was bugged. I did still have the heirloom on me, a sort of pendant in the shape of an egg with an intricate silver inlay throughout. But if I'm being honest; it wasn't much different than some of the other trinkets and treasures you can find in the world of Skyrim.

Stevie suddenly grew excited about another new location that had appeared on the map near Shor’s Stone. The symbol was that of a house, which wasn't a commonality for the Skyrim map. In terms of buildings, you have cities and towns - that's it. But this new symbol was a simple house with a door, two windows and a roof.

Hovering over it revealed the name - Craelin's Hovel.

I thought the name was strange because a hovel is far different than a house. Regardless, we took a carriage to Riften and set off.

A low fog rolled in as we grew closer. The symbol appeared on the compass and Stevie was surmising as to what we might find there. I told him it was probably just going to be some shack that had been toppled over and that the only wealth to be had would be in the form of ragged clothes and moldy food.

How wrong I was.

Cresting over the top of a grassy knoll ahead of us was a sharp-peaked roof with two windows jutting out. The roof had purple Nordic-like shingles in the shape of spearheads overlapping each other and the building itself seemed Norse inspired as well. There was a warm, subtle glow radiating outwardly from the "hovel" and even though I was staring at it through a screen; it felt welcoming.

Stevie did not feel the same way. I distinctly remember him saying, "This place feels weird…" but I can't remember if I responded.

I do, however, remember entering the building and feeling like I had become one with the world. My external senses had shut off and my entire focus was on what lay inside the hovel.

The door opened and after a short loading screen, I was on the other side.

And, nothing. The entire building was completely empty, save for some cobwebs. Stevie surveyed the first room; it was a type of entry area with a normal living space you'd find in any home. I pushed further in towards what I figured were the bedrooms. 

All empty. 

If dust had value, we'd be rich.

"What mod is this a part of?" I asked Stevie, who hadn't said anything since before we entered the hovel.

"I honestly have no idea. Don't you remember me saying that there were a lot of random mods and that I couldn't keep track of them all?"

"I guess. If this has anything to do with that man and his heirloom, then I truly think it's completely fucked. The mod, I mean."

"Yeah, this place shouldn't be empty, right? It's so dark too, even though it looked like there were lights when we were outside."

"Let's just leave. I'm sure the other mods work just fine, so we can find something else to do."

Stevie ran along one of the walls in an effort to find a potentially hidden switch, but alas, we were not so lucky.

And that's when it happened.

*Taldarin142 has connected.*

"What?" I asked aloud.

"Is that someone you know?" Asked Stevie.

"No? This was supposed to be an adventure for just me and you. I wouldn't invite someone else!"

"Well, I don't know how they got in here then!"

"Me neither, this IS a private server, right?"

"Yeah, absolutely. Which means he has to be some sort of hacker…"

"Great, they've come along just in time to ruin our fun."

*Taldarin142 has disconnected.*

"Oh… never mind?"

"That was fucking weird." Said Stevie.

"Let's hope it was a one time thing. Maybe the server just bugged out and allowed a random user in until it realized they weren't whitelisted?"

"It can't be that sophisticated, can it?"

I grew irate for no reason, "I don't know dude! I just want to play the game with you!"

"Okay, okay, calm down! I'm trying to fix it right now… and… there! I've made doubly sure that it doesn't happen again."

"Alright. Good. I can only imagine the dumb shit a random might do to troll our playthrough. I'm glad they're gone."

"Me too." Stevie said quietly.

"Well, what do you want to do now?"

He pondered a moment, "Maybe we should try to sell that thing we got?"

"The heirloom? We can try, I don't really want to hold onto it for the rest of the time we're playing."

"Let's go to Solitude, I'd like to check out that raiment shop while we’re there!" He said excitedly.

"Alright, let's go." I said before pulling up the game map. I remember hearing a strange sound in the game. I thought it might have been Stevie jumping around in the background, but when I exited the map - nothing was there. He had already fast-traveled and I was alone in that empty hovel. I definitely didn't feel alone. I know it's strange, but despite only playing a game? I truly felt like something else was there.

I quickly joined Stevie so as not to keep him waiting. Solitude was bustling after a quaint public beheading jostled everyone's britches and Stevie was inside of the raiment shop. I went to the general store next door and tried to sell the heirloom. For whatever reason, I couldn't get rid of it. The game acted as if it were still in relation to a quest despite displaying a fifty-septim value.

But something else happened. The shopkeeper, Sayma, explicitly stated, "Keep that thing away from me!" Upon trying again she said, "Get out of here with that, please! Just go before something bad happens!" After that, talking to her was pointless. She wouldn't say anything more.

Stevie thought the character's strange dialogue was the result of one of the many mods he couldn't remember installing, but it all just felt so real AND wrong at the same time.

*Taldarin142 has connected.*

"Oh come on, what the fuck?!" Asked Stevie who I could hear furiously typing.

"I don't know man, you might have to complain to whoever you're hosting the server through."

"That's the thing though, I'm hosting myself. Like, I created the server. NOBODY should be able to join, not without my permission at least." He sounded defeated, I didn't blame him.

And then, I saw them. Well, not THEM, but I saw another player character. For those that know the layout of Skyrim's many cities and Solitude in particular, there's that walkway that leads up to the blacksmith from the town square - yeah; they were standing at the top, just watching.

"Stevie, is that them?" I asked while directing his attention to the top of the ramp.

"I'm going to go check!" He snarled harshly.

Stevie enabled voice chat in-game and began to question whoever they were, "This is a private server, please leave! Why do you keep joining any-"

*Taldarin142 has disconnected.*

They disappeared before our eyes without so much as a single movement, not even a flick of their mouse. Their character only watched us but showed no sign of a human player existing on the other side. 

Things get REALLY strange from here on out.

Stevie contacted a friend who knew about servers and how they worked. They asked for certain information but provided an answer that neither one of us expected. And, if I'm being honest? I don't really know if I can believe them. They said that after interpreting the vast data provided - there was only a record of two people ever having accessed the world and neither one of them was named Taldarin142.

After that, Stevie and I took a small break from Skyrim. Even though we were both so excited to play; it was far too worrisome having to deal with a potential hacker.

The break didn't last long though, and soon we were right back in Solitude - standing right where we had both been the moment Taldarin142 joined and then left. Honestly, we waited for a good twenty minutes or so before actually making a game plan. I could sense the apprehension in Stevie's voice when I asked what he wanted to do. I knew he was just as concerned as I was in regards to our mysterious invader.

Suddenly, Sayma, the same woman who owns bits and pieces (the general store of Solitude), rushed past me. She was shouting about an "atrocity." We decided to follow her and came upon a crowd gathered in the Bard's College courtyard.

I said aloud, "We haven't even done King Olaf's quest yet, why are they here?"

"You're not going to believe this…" Said Stevie with a tinge of a tremble on his voice.

"Believe what?" I began before the crowd parted and I noticed exactly what he was talking about.

The man, the one who gave us the heirloom quest, was hung by his neck right there in the Bard's College courtyard. He swung back and forth as an apparent subtle breeze blew through. Silence fell over everyone, including Stevie and I. One of the wandering children of Solitude was crying and it got me thinking about why these NPCs were acting so life-like.

I think Stevie concurred because he suddenly mentioned, "Dude, this is SO weird. Why are they acting as if they were programmed to be real people?"

"I was thinking the same thing!"

"Glad I'm not the only one. It's like they are actually mourning for someone they knew. These are just codes… ones and zeros; they don't have those kinds of connections."

*Taldarin142 has connected.*

"Dude, I don't know what to do to stop this!" Stevie shouted while flicking his mouse every which way to locate our unwelcome guest.

Little did he know (because I couldn't find a voice to speak), I saw them almost as soon as they joined. Somehow; they had spawned amidst the crowd without Stevie noticing. What's worse is that they were doing something to one of the NPCs. I can't exactly describe it accurately, but it was like they were draining them of their blood.

I only say that because the NPC in question began turning pale and Taldarin142 had their finger driven into their neck. I'm not sure how - these mechanics and animations were unlike anything I had ever seen before. The NPC appeared weaker and weaker before eventually collapsing onto the ground and then?

*Taldarin142 has disconnected.*

"Fuck! I didn't get a chance to see them this time…" Said Stevie in a fit of defeated rage.

While stammering, I turned towards him and said, "I - I saw them…"

"You did?! Why didn't you say anything?" I could sense an aggressive confusion in his voice.

"I just couldn't find the words man… I'm sorry. But like… they just killed that NPC by… draining her blood? I - I don't know what I saw but that shouldn't be possible."

"Did you get a chance to see what their character model looked like?"

When I thought about it, I realized that no, I couldn't remember a single detail about them. "No… I can't remember what they looked like."

"How can you not remember?!"

"Listen, I don't know! When I try to think about them, nothing comes up; it's like I have some sort of mental block!"

"Dammit! This is pissing me off. Why can't we just play without having to worry about shit like this?!"

"The real question is what exactly this 'shit' is? NPCs hung in the courtyard, another player draining the blood of an NPC in a completely foreign way? That said player randomly joining and leaving over and over but somehow always knowing where we are? These are the real questions dude. I'm starting to get this evil feeling from whoever they are."

He was quiet for a brief moment before saying, "I think I know what you mean. I'm sorry, I just… really wanted to play this with you."

"I know man, maybe we will have to call it quits for a bit and then pick it back up later. By then they will have moved on and nothing will ruin our playthrough anymore."

He sighed, "You're right, this sucks." 

"Alright man, let's disconnect and maybe play something else?"

"For sure… wait…" Stevie said in an uncertain tone.

"What's the matter?"

"I can't leave."

"What do you mean?"

"It won't let me fucking log out man, what else could I mean?!"

"Calm down and just give it a sec to register - here, let me see if I can leave." I moused over the disconnect button and clicked it.

No response. My character remained on screen standing next to Stevies. "Well?" He questioned harshly.

"Strange; it won't let me disconnect either. Maybe the server is fucked up?" I continually clicked disconnect over and over but spamming it did nothing. "I'm just going to force close the game with the task manager."

*Ctrl+alt+del*

"Great, well my PC must be soft-locked or something because I can't even pull up task manager."

"I can't either!" Said Stevie who I could hear frantically typing AND clicking through his mic.

"Relax man, I'm going to manually shut off my PC, you should do the same. When they reboot - I'll rejoin you in discord."

"Fine, let's do it."

I reached down to my right where my PC tower sat and held the power button. I must have held it for a full minute, but nothing happened. All I could do was utter a subtle, "Um…"

"Why isn't it working? Are our PC's fucked?!" Stevie was freaking out and I didn't have the answers he sought.

"I don't know! Fuck it-" I reached behind the tower and clicked the power switch; it still didn't turn off. So, I unplugged it.

Skyrim remained on the screen unchanging. My PC continued to function despite no longer receiving power and it sincerely defied all possible logic in my mind.

*Taldarin142 has connected.*

"I'm starting to get worried Stevie. You're not going to believe this, but I unplugged my PC. It's like not actively plugged in right now."

"How is this possible…?" He asked worriedly.

That's when it happened. One of the guards in Solitude ran up to me and could barely seem to speak. He said, "Y - you need to go! You don't belong here and h - he will find you!"

"Stevie, one of these guards is saying some weird shit, he's telling me we have to leave because someone is going to find us?"

I turned around to see him interacting with a different guard. "We need to go!" He suddenly shouted and then his character disappeared.

"Where did you go?!" I asked hurriedly.

"I went to Windhelm, hurry! Get out of there!"

I pulled up my map and found the icon as fast as possible. I watched the loading screen with bated breath before reappearing in Windhelm. Stevie was standing in front of the inn and I walked over to him. "What do we do? I'm not going to bust my computer just to stop whatever is happening - there has to be an explanation!"

*Taldarin142 has disconnected.*

"Who the fuck is this person?!" Stevie asked in hysterics.

"We need to figure out how to fix this, never mind them for right now."

A foreign voice spoke up behind me, "You can’t fix it."

I turned around to see that beggar who's always in Windhelm standing by one of the large blazing braziers in front of the inn. "Did… did she just answer my question?" I asked Stevie.

"Yes, I did." Said the woman.

"What. The. Fuck." Said Stevie.

"Can she… hear me? Am I losing my fucking mind dude?"

"You're not losing your mind and yes, I can hear you." She cackled for a time before it turned into a hoarse cough, "you're just like the rest of us now…"

"What the hell does that mean?" Asked Stevie.

"We were once like you. Living, breathing souls of true reality. But after facing… him, we've become only shells of our former selves."

"You're telling me, that YOU used to be a real person?"

"That's absolutely insane." Said Stevie with a slight chuckle. I honestly felt like laughing too because the notion was more than ridiculous.

The woman spoke, "You must not let him sneak up on you. That's how he gets you - he connects, finds you and gets behind you. You're completely vulnerable and if he manages to siphon your blood, then you will be no different than me or any other NPC in this world."

"This is bullshit."

"Yeah, none of this is fooling me." Added Stevie.

"Then you're both as good as gone." Said the old, frail woman before slowly walking off towards the graveyard.

I turned my character towards Stevie and said, "I can't sit anymore, I'll have to leave the game running while I go attend to real life matters."

"I understand… but wait… I don't feel so well…"

As soon as he said that, I started to feel sick too. My head was swimming and I felt a weakness resonating throughout my body. "I… know what you mean… I'm… feeling it too…" I managed to speak rather weakly.

"You can't leave." Someone said nearby, someone I couldn't see but sounded familiar. I reached my hand towards my mouse against great force and turned to face the one and only, Jarl Ulfric.

"Wha - what?" I asked through strained breathing.

"You can't leave, you can't even attempt to leave. If you do, he will know and he WILL stop you."

"Who is… he?" Asked Stevie who sounded as though he was beginning to feel better.

"You've seen him, haven't you Kessal?" Jarl Ulfric addressed me directly.

"You know my name? H - how?"

"Answer me." He demanded.

"Y - yes… I've seen him, but I can't remember what he looks like. We didn't even know it was a 'him' until now. I… am I really talking to a fucking NPC right now like they're a real person?!"

"I WAS A REAL PERSON!" Shouted Jarl Ulfric with a mighty Thu'um right through my character's body. I suddenly felt my heart skip a beat as if his voice affected me physically.

"You? A real person?" Asked Stevie before ending with a slight chuckle.

"Yes, I was Jeremy Lincoln, a simple electrician and gamer. I, like many others, met a grim fate at the hands of… him."

"Okay, I'll bite. Who exactly is he?" I asked with agitation.

"The soul of evil incarnate. The spirit of vengeful death. He is what remains of a gamer who was both sick-minded and malevolent. We don't quite know how he got here, but we know how WE got here. Unfortunately… we don't know how to prevent it from happening." Jarl Ulfric, or rather, Jeremy seemed to retreat into a deep, depressive area of his mind.

"So you're saying we are going to end up like you?" Asked Stevie. I heard an audible gulp come through his mic.

"It is very likely. Say, did you happen to download a mod titled - 'Fantastic Lore-Friendly Quests'?"

I turned to face Stevie's character and awaited his response. After two minutes he said, "Yeah, that sounds familiar…"

"That's how HE got into your systems and manipulated your files. Each time he connects - he's really altering aspects of the world and slowly assimilating your entire being into the game's mainframe. You are, essentially, being turned into code. It is likely that the world you might see around you now is simply a coded reality. You cannot escape."

"This is impossible."

"No, Mr. Kessal. Not anymore."

Stevie started to sob, "W - what do we do man?"

"I… I don't know…"

I faced Jarl Ulfric, but suddenly his head shot up towards the sky and his mouth opened wider than anatomically possible. It stretched to the middle of his chest before he started to screech like a fiendish banshee and the sound was ear piercing. His eyes washed over with an inky blackness and his teeth began to elongate.

"Something's not right, let's get out of here!" I shouted and pulled up the map.

"Where? Where do we go?!" Stevie questioned in a panicked voice.

I thought quickly, "High Hrothgar!" 

"Done!"

The ensuing loading screen was excruciatingly long and something equally worrying happened. I could no longer communicate with Stevie if it wasn't in-game. I wondered if he was experiencing the same realization crisis?

Upon finally loading in - we were both standing in the falling snow with two flights of curved stairs leading up to the entrance of High Hrothgar. Why did I choose to go there? I thought that maybe, just MAYBE, if people were being trapped in the bodies of various NPCs, then perhaps the Greybeards had the spirits of 'wiser' humans (since they were the wisest of Skyrim NPCs.)

What we found instead was nothing short of a nightmare.

Normally, mature content wouldn't bother me like blood, gore, violence etc. But, after entering High Hrothgar and seeing the veritable bloodbath horror show on the floor, ceiling and walls - I'm not sure I can handle it anymore.

All of the Greybeards had been slaughtered. Decimated beyond recognition.

Some had their face skin stretched over their heads and others were disemboweled with their guts spread across the stone floor. At first, I thought it was the result of a fight being brought to them, but upon further inspection I discovered a few must have taken their own lives. It had to be because of him.

I found that I was starting to feel and sense more and more of the Skyrim world. Like I was becoming a part of it the longer I played. Stevie's character suddenly began to behave as if it were real - he was moving his arms and legs in ways not possible with a mouse and keyboard. And then I realized…

I could do it too. 

We were both able to interact with the world as if we were really there and that's when the scent of death became apparent.

Stevie looked around at the carnage and said, "I - I'm scared…"

I started to panic and nearly lost my balance, "We can't give up…"

"What else are we supposed to d - do?!" He questioned intensely, "Live out the rest of our days in a f - fucking fantasy world? Not to mention one lorded over by a deadly being!"

"We're here now and we must survive… there… has to be something we can do to get out of this!"

A faint and gravelly voice interjected from somewhere in one of the corridors, "Yes…"

"Who said that?!" Asked Stevie a bit too loud. His voice echoed throughout the halls of High Hrothgar.

"Shh!" I begged for his silence.

"Come to the… room of diplomacy." Said the waning voice.

"Do we go?" Asked Stevie hastily.

"What do we have to lose?"

"Okay, you're right."

We navigated around the eviscerated bodies ahead of us and turned down the hall to the right and then another right into the room of diplomacy. Sitting at the big stone table was a single Greybeard, barely clinging to life. He wasn't one I recognized, or remembered rather, but I sensed nothing but good intentions emanating from him.

"Good… you've made your choice." He said slowly with great conviction.

"Tell us how to get out. How to fix this!" Demanded Stevie.

"You must go to the place of origin. The failed mod, the one that never saw the light of day. You've been there before, you remember, don't you?"

I thought for a moment before it struck me like lightning, "C - Craelin's Hovel!"

"Yes, that's the place. We've all fallen prey to that wicked, empty building. But make no mistake; it's far from innocent. That's where… he makes his home. Normally you can't see what it really looks like, but now, in this current state, you should have no problem."

"What are we supposed to do?" I asked eagerly.

"Burn it down."

"That's it? Just, burn it? Nobody could have done that with like… a flaming arrow?" Stevie asked rather bluntly.

"That won't work. He has to be inside and none of us have been able to get within a few feet before succumbing to his fiendish ways. You'll see now, when you get there. The bodies are numerous…"

"Can you not help us? Don't you want to get out of here too?" I asked.

"No… it won't work. If we all go marching to his lair it'll be obvious. But, if one of you gets out, then you have a chance at shutting this place down for good!"

"Won't that kill everyone stuck here?" Asked Stevie.

"We are all too far gone. I've been here for nearly a year now. I'm sure someone found my malnourished body sitting in my computer chair staring mindlessly at a burned out screen a long time ago. Besides… I'm finished." He then leaned back and revealed a deep gash across his stomach, "I've been using magic to keep myself alive, but it won't last forever and I'm afraid that you'll find the world you used to know out there a lot less… familiar."

"What do you mean?" Wondered Stevie aloud.

"I can sense it now…" he began weakly, "The province has grown hostile, far more dangerous. The people here, they aren't themselves… not anymore." He sighed heavily, "HE influences them and I can offer nothing but a sincere warning and my best advice. Watch the roads and stay away from the cities - he'll be back and believe me, he will know what you're up to. He always knows."

"What about you?" I reiterated.

He waved his hand, "No, there's nothing to be done. Let me go in peace and be on your way. Remember, you two are likely the only sane minds that remain in this deteriorating world. Everyone else you stumble upon will probably be against your best interests. His corruption… it spreads."

"Thank you. For what it's worth." I said before lowering my head.

"Go now." He muttered.

"Come on, let's get a move on!" Said Stevie.

"Right." I responded in a sort of daze. Things were happening too quickly and it was really jarring. I was having a difficult time acclimating to my newfound reality and it made it challenging just to put one foot in front of the other.

We left High Hrothgar and at this point, fast-traveling was not an option. We'd have to travel by foot and I noticed something else as well. I was hungry.

"Are you feeling that too man?" I turned to Stevie and asked as we began to descend the infamous 7,000 steps.

"Feeling what?"

"Hunger."

"Oh. Yeah, I am."

"How can you be this calm so suddenly?"

"Haven't you always wanted this?” He began, “It's sort of a dream come true now that I think about it."

"What part of having your spirit sucked into a static fantasy world from 2011 is a 'dream come true?' Never mind the Skyrim equivalent of the Grim Reaper lurking about…"

"I don't know man, I'm just making idle conversation."

"So you DON'T want to get out of here?"

He sighed, "I guess I'm saying that if somehow we get permanently stuck here… well… I suppose it wouldn't be so bad. I mean… all the others have been here for who knows how long, right? It can't be that bad."

"It could and might be. Remember what that Greybeard said. Everything will be different now… I'm not sure what that means but it gives me the chills."

"I think the snow is doing that." He said lightheartedly.

"Shut up."

"Suit yourself."

We stayed quiet for the rest of the descent. I'll tell you, those steps are no joke. Klimmek was really doing those Greybeards a favor by volunteering to routinely climb them. Soon, the falling snow let up and Ivarstead came into view. But all I could hear were screams. Terrifying, blood-curdling screams.

The town was ablaze and twisted creatures were ravaging the townsfolk. Klimmek was on the bridge, or should I say, all over it. So, I guess you could say we didn’t have to worry about him.

I spoke in a whisper, "This must be that corruption he was talking about…"

"What is happening down there?!" He harshly whispered back.

"I don't know, I see monsters, former husks of the people of Skyrim." I turned my head away from Ivarstead, "This place holds no shelter for us - we must be on our way."

"Do you remember where it was? We can't fast-travel anymore so we'll have to rely on memory to guide our path."

"I think I remember; it was near Shor's Stone I believe."

"That sounds right." Assured Stevie with the best hopeful voice he could muster.

We skirted around Ivarstead to avoid the upheaval and made our way to where we thought Shor's Stone was. I thought I knew those roads better than my own hands, but I found myself questioning whether or not I could trust my judgment of directions. 

Stevie kept silent and it was better that way because we could hear horrendous sounds coming from far distant locations and some very near. Every once in a while, as we walked through the forest, we would spot some sort of terror the likes of which would rattle every fiber of our being. Things unimaginable, things with too many arms or legs - things with hundreds of eyes or a head that slunk across the ground like a fleshy snake. 

By some miracle of memory, we arrived at Shor's Stone. It took far longer than we thought possible, likely because of the relative difference of perspective. Experiencing the world of Skyrim through a screen doesn't do it justice, but living in the world as an actual character makes you realize the true magnitude of it all. Long story short, I'd say it took about three hours or so to get there.

It didn't appear as if anyone was there, which was good for us, but next came the hard part. Finding Craelin's Hovel.

I'm glad I had Stevie with me though because I almost made a grave mistake. While taking my first steps into the small mining town, he stopped me. "Wait," he muttered, "look over there, by the mine."

My eyes trailed the length of his index finger to meet the object of interest. People were crawling in and out of the mine like spiders. Then, it dawned on me. The Redbelly mine always had spiders in it and now it seemed the spiders had combined with the people of the town. Wicked things they were, scurrying about on chitinous legs with long hairs coming off them. The sun must have been preventing them from pushing further into town which is why I thought the place was empty.

Without Stevie's keen eyes, I'd probably have met my fate. So, with the utmost attentiveness, we avoided the mine AND the town while keeping as quiet as possible.

Once we were clear, Stevie turned to face me, "Do you know where to go from here?"

"Honestly? No. I'm navigating on blind luck at this point."

"Well, I think I remember…"

"You do?!" I shouted probably a bit too loudly.

"Quiet man!"

"I'm sorry. Truly."

"Yeah, well anyways… I think it's just beyond that hill. Remember the swampy mess that encircled the hovel? It had this glowing hue. You never mentioned it, but it's something I couldn't seem to get out of my mind." He nodded towards the hill in question, "See that glow?"

Sure enough, there was a glow. It was faint but it was there.

"Are you ready to end this?" I asked stoically.

He nodded slowly and said with sincerity, "Yes, but if something should happen to me and you manage to make it out… please tell everyone our story. Oh, and don't forget to leave out my unquestionable bravery!"

I chuckled and rested my hand on his shoulder, "We will both make it out, my friend. BUT, if not, I'll do everything in my power to make things right."

He smiled and touched my hand. "Thank you… it's been one hell of an adventure."

"Well, it's not over yet! Let's finish this!"

"Right behind you!"

We stumbled over the hill and were immediately met with an entirely different house than before. The one in front of us now was palatial! A massive testament to a fundamentally crazed "Lord" of this world. No army stood to prevent our advance, just piles of decaying bodies and the man himself wasn't there either. That did bring to the forefront of my mind the realization that neither one of us would actually know when or if he had joined the world because there are no notification prompts in the "real world."

My anxiety grew. I was fearful of what awaited us on the other side of the home's ornate brown door. I could sense the fear coming from Stevie as well and I also noticed several beads of sweat forming on his face.

Once we reached the door, I looked to him and nodded. He returned the nod, and I wrenched the handle - forcing the door open in one swift motion.

Emptiness, just like before. The only difference was that there was more of it. That, and an overwhelming sense of dread.

Stevie nudged me and gestured with his head towards the back of the room. I'm not sure how I missed it, but then again; it was rather dark.

Someone was sitting on the ground. They were on their knees and facing away from us.

"We've come to end your torture of the innocent people of both the real world AND Skyrim." I said with immense conviction.

They snickered like a deranged lunatic before rising to their feet. We both stood in preparation for battle when suddenly, he disappeared.

I blinked twice to see if my eyes were playing tricks on me, but they weren't - he had vanished. I turned to confer with Stevie but saw my worst fears brought to light. 

He was there, standing behind Stevie, siphoning his blood. There was a vacant look in his eyes as his essence was being drained, but it was already too late to save him. The moment I thrusted my blade forward to pierce Taldarin142, Stevie's body slumped to the ground and our assailant vanished once more.

I narrowed my eyes, stifled my tears and did my best not to let the same fate befall me. He reappeared in the spot near the back of the room and two sconces were set ablaze on either side of him. His armor reflected the torchlight but I was still able to see that what he wore obscured every inch of his skin.

There was no time to lose. He had provided me with the very thing I needed to end this.

I sprung into action and charged straight at him. There was a visible reaction of what I might call surprise based on his body language, but I just kept going. Suddenly, he manifested a sword out of a void-like hole and connected it with my blade. The sound rang throughout the empty room and vibrated my brain.

We clashed, fiercely. He never said a word and his fighting skills were ferocious. I tried to take every opportunity given to find my mark, but each was met with his defying steel. But opportunity ALWAYS presents itself, even in a fantasy world.

Against his better judgment, Taldarin142 made an imperfect decision. He turned his body ever so slightly to the right, which allowed for me to counter his attack and thrust my blade directly into his side. I felt the resistance of my metal impaling him, flesh, bone and all. He did not cry out in pain, but he did drop his blade and fall to his knees.

I gazed down at him for a few short moments. He sat with his head facing towards the ground and his hands on his lap, palms facing upwards. I pushed him over onto his side before walking to one of the sconces and picking it up.

He did not react or move. I walked back over to him and stood over his dying body with the torch in my hand.

Just as I was about to drop it, he spoke, "I will never die."

I grinned and said, "This is for Stevie and for everyone else you've wrought your ceaseless torment against!" Then, I threw the torch to the ground and the wooden floor immediately ruptured into an immense conflagration. It was beautiful, even through a screen.

A screen. That's right, just as I was so easily brought into the world of Skyrim, I was sent back the same jarring way but with one distinct difference. Stevie wasn't responding to me which meant… he was truly gone.

I called the police to do a welfare check on him. I told them that he just stopped responding and I got worried. He was found dead, sitting in his computer chair with his hands still on his mouse and keyboard.

After his funeral, I had an epiphany and even though you might think I would have suffered some sort of trauma about Skyrim as a whole, I had an interesting thought. I reconnected to our server. Stevie's parents gave me his PC because it just kept reminding them of the image of their dead son, so I was able to acquire all of our server information. The world had returned to normal and whether it was for good or bad, the NPCs were acting just as they were intended to.

I spent hours upon hours scouring the farthest reaches of Skyrim for a sign. For anything. I felt deep in my bones that he was here, that Stevie had lived on SOMEWHERE in the depths of this world.

And then, I found him. I found Stevie, but he wasn't called Stevie anymore, instead, his character was named "Steveran The Brave," and he was living as the head of his own house. I talked to him, but he only had one line of dialogue, "Have you seen my friend? They did something that I can't quite remember, but I'd like to thank them for it nonetheless." There was no follow-up dialogue and I felt content with the fact that even though I missed him, he was happy living his life as he had always dreamed of.

I decided to leave him to his home and his family. I walked away and pulled up the menu to leave the server for the last time. I clicked the disconnect button. No response. I clicked again but nothing happened.

*Taldarin142 has connected.*

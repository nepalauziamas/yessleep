Hey everyone. I know it’s been a few days. But a lot has happened since then.First off. I was spending my time off work literally looking into all the nooks and crannies of the internet to try and figure out more about what that thing was. Literally almost every waking moment I spend looking up local reports, rumors, and the likes to try and piece it together. Which takes me to the comments I received on my last post.


A few of you mentioned something about a “Skinwalker”. I had no Idea what this was. But apparently it’s a popular subject in online circles and comes from Native American Culture in the US. And from what I found, a few things line up. But I don’t think it was a Skin Walker.Some of you also suggested it may be a Vampire. And I think that’s what this thing was. Everytime I think back to that room. The blood staining the walls, the stench of Iron in the air, and the horror that was laid before me, something strange stood out. There had been no entrails or viscera aside from blood in the room.


To confirm my suspicions, I contacted the morgue’s office and the coroner. I wasn’t able to get much due to the ongoing investigation I assume, but after telling them that I was the EMS called to the house. They told me that indeed the only wounds delivered were slashes against the stomach, seemingly the first strike to knock the woman off guard, and large punctures into the neck nearly tore the whole throat open. Which the autopsy revealed was what obviously killed her. she’d bled out from the wound, and lost so much blood that her body had barely a pint left.


And now with that information, on top of what it was wearing. The Vampire theory is nearly all but confirmed.


That takes me to a few nights ago, the Night I got back to work. I’ll admit, I wasn’t entirely there that night. Especially since the one thing on my mind was what had happened the last time I was on call. In truth, I chose to go back because I knew that It would be my way to get first hand information on potential leads. If I can figure out more about whats out there, how it hunts. Maybe I can find where it is and kill it. I don’t know why. But I feel like I have to, maybe some sense of righteousness, stupidity. Or maybe revenge. Or maybe with the simple knowledge that it’s gone I’ll be able to properly sleep at night.


After hours of silence, and listening into dispatch, I heard something exactly what I was looking for. A report on a break in homicide. The details of which described it as a stabbing. Figuring that it wasn’t truly a stabbing, I radioed in and told I was on route for additional medical services.


After getting there, it was exactly what I expected. Not a stabbing, but another attack. Yet again someone that was home alone, nearly in the middle of nowhere. To everyone else there it certainly seemed like one, but given that the cause of death was an attack to the neck, and all the blood spattered across the room. I knew better.


It wasn’t until last night that I was able to get to another scene. Apparently there had been many more than just the ones I had been able to get too. This one was different. There were actual witnesses to the attack. Two roommates, late twenties. Staying in a rental house in the woods and had called in after hearing sudden noises in the middle of the night. Only to find something killing their friend.I was able to actually talk to one of them. A man, he had light scrapes on his arms from falling when he’d run out of the house with the other roommate screaming and calling 999. I asked him if he was able to see what it was. He said to me “Something tall, wearing all black, and its face…god its face was covered in blood. Like it had been sprayed with...blood…Their eyes were bright red. Face slightly sunken in…” That was about as much as I could get out of him before needing to move on.


But right as I left, someone had come walking up the path. Someone I’d never seen before. And Certainly didn’t look like Medical, Fire, or Police. But wore a brown leather jacket, thick fur trailing down the middle of it. Like those old school pilot jackets you see in museums. A deep brown leather hat covering their eyes. The only thing I could see was sparse facial hair as their combat boots slapped against the gravel, walking up the path to the house. His stride seemed determined and focused. Everyone there paid no mind to the man as he entered the house, hand tucked deep into his pocket. As though he belonged there.And tomorrow night, I have a plan. After visiting all these places. And looking on a map, they all seem to be located near the same area. All within ten kilometers of each other. The only place I could think this thing was staying was in the thick woods where all of these homes were nearby too.


I went to a butcher shop. Bought a gallon of pig's blood. And a whole pig. And I even bought a gun. Some sort of cheap revolver I think. Fires these decently sized bullets. It took me forever to find one here. But I was able to. I think it was a pawn shop way, way out in the country. If I’m caught with this thing. I’ll be in big trouble. And for those that were saying to get a crucifix and silver. I don’t know if those will really work. Since one in movies you have to believe in them to work for them too, and the only thing I’d imagine silver doing is irritating it. But I will sharpen out a few stakes, just in case. Since that out of all makes the most sense, since it’d be plunged into it’s heart. But I’d assume a bullet would work the same way.


I’ll update when I can. And if I don’t…I may not be in the land of the living anymore. Bye for now.

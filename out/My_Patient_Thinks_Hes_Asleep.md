One of my patients is convinced, *convinced* that he’s asleep. 

I was one of the psychiatrists whose responsibility it was to diagnose him when he was admitted. The hospital in which I work is specifically designed for the more… *severe* patients. Patients that are, for whatever reason, more a danger to themselves or others than most mental patients. While most assume the latter is the difficult part of my job, the former is actually the more strenuous factor in working here. I’m fairly adept at protecting myself, which most people don’t often assume upon looking at me, but stopping our patients from harming themselves is actually much more difficult. No amount of kickboxing and Muay Thai can stop a patient from cutting a hole in her arm when we aren't looking. Because of our particular specialization in the more severe cases and disorders, this part of the job is even harder. I’ve been trained to help people with depression, which is not to say that it’s easy, depression is very serious, but it’s certainly easier than a man who is convinced beyond a sliver of a doubt that the only way to bring his dead wife back is to remove his lower intestine. But Arthur, he is an entirely different story, for reasons I’m still unsure of. 

When I had first read his file, I believed he had a schizoaffective disorder. He’d been cited with intense delusions, possible hallucinations (written as “spreading hallucination”, whatever the hell that means), and extreme aggression - not to the point of violence, he hadn’t had any physical incidents as far as I could tell, but he was apparently known to go out of his way to insult people, always finding the perfect words to ruin someone. Nigh sociopathic, but he could just be a dick. Delusions, hallucinations, and a mood disorder seemed like schizoaffective to me, of course, I’d have to wait until I actually met him to be sure, medical notes aren’t always the easiest to understand between doctors, and whoever took this definitely had their own way of writing things.

As was expected, the file didn’t *quite* line up with reality, but it was...strange. I was fairly sure he wasn’t having hallucinations, but he didn't even *act* like he was hallucinating. I initially suspected that the strange notation was a typo or an attempt to convey some sort of panoramic hallucination or perhaps even some hallucination affecting proprioception; the word “spreading” was terribly nonspecific. But I couldn’t find any sign of hallucinations, and he certainly wasn’t faking any. His mannerisms seemed fairly average. As for his supposed mood disorder, well I was completely surprised, even after reading his file’s description. I met with him expecting the worst, approaching him with two nurses and our newest clinical psychologist, Doctor Matthias D. A. Bunny, who was just spreading his wings in the new environment. I’m going to be honest, I couldn’t imagine referring to him as Doctor Bunny without laughing, so I had resorted to calling him by his first name exclusively.

He was waiting in admissions along with a nurse, I assume involved with his previous caretakers, as she definitely wasn’t one of ours given the brown uniform.

“Hello,” I said, approaching him with his file in my hand, “I’m Doctor Penn, one of the assistant directors of the hospital and your doctor. I’ll be helping you transition into your stay here.”

“Oh wow a woman,” he half chuckled, not losing eye contact with me. Fantastic, one of these ones. Here I thought progress was being made in the world. I was already fed up, and my tone became flat.

“Yes, I’m a woman, if you’d prefer another psychia-”

“Oh no,” he interrupted, “I just think it’s great, a woman in such a high position here, and you certainly seem capable, I’d love for you to be the one to help me.” I was stunned, it wasn’t perfectly normal but I sure as hell wasn’t expecting him to be so polite. I think I was staring at him for a solid few seconds. “Oh shit I hope I haven’t insulted you,” he gave a nervous chuckled he seemed genuinely hesitant and concerned.

“No, of course not,” I had a slight stammer. Weirdly, hearing him say ‘shit’ was kind of comforting. He wasn't polite in a creepy, polished, unsettling way, he was just nice. I turned now to the nurse. “Can I ask about how his previous care? The notes I was left are a little vague.”

“I’m sorry, I don’t know much about him, I was just told to help take him here.” Something about her seemed worried, a mixture of concern and hurriedness, although I’m not sure why she’d be so worried about him. “You should be able to diagnose it all yourself when all is right.” She thanked us and quickly exited. It was strange seeing a nurse act that way, but I just dismissed it as nervousness. She seemed new, and I found myself instead wondering why a new nurse would be asked to transport a patient she was unfamiliar with.

At this point I didn’t know what to make of him, all I knew was that whoever wrote his file was probably completely incompetent with their shitty, unprofessional notation and misdiagnosis of two significant symptoms. This coupled with the nurse he arrived with made me consider throwing out his entire file and starting anew; I wasn’t sure how the previous hospital he came from could possibly call themselves a medical institution. All I had to go on was delusions, and his delusional disorder was present in force. Like I said, he’s convinced that he’s asleep. And he wants to wake up.

I’m sure you see where this is going.

This isn’t that strange a delusion, all things considered. What amounted to a different iteration of Cotard delusion hardly seemed reason to bring him to this hospital, and I wasn’t so sure this was even the place for him, he seemed fully functioning and fairly socially aware. I was, however, quickly proven wrong.

Within five minutes of me leaving his room after going through standard admission procedure, he was caught trying to end his own life. He was found on the ground with blood all over his arms; he had broken his bedpost and used it to slice down the length of his arms. Deep. Deep enough to be able to differentiate muscle fibers once the wounds were cleaned, which was incredibly difficult. The incisions were surprisingly clean, and at the deepest were 2.23 centimeters deep, almost straight in between his radius and ulnar. Were the wounds not so precise and clean, I don’t know that we would've been able to save his life. He was immediately moved to the west wing of the hospital, where we put the patients that required a more watchful eye. I’m not sure if it was because of his manners or even any real medical thinking, but I was hesitant to restrain him in any severe way, no padded room or straitjackets, just a new, featureless room with constant supervision. 

Being an assistant director, it was uncommon for me to take on long-term patients, and Doctor Matthias became his primary. I hadn’t heard anything about him until a week later when Matthias sent me a request to move him to a personal safety room. A padded cell. I had to talk to him directly about this request, putting a patient in a padded room long-term was generally not done, and while straitjackets were used, it seemed very unusual to confine Arthur to one in a padded room indefinitely when all he really had was a suicidal tendency. I found him with one of his other new patients after asking a charge nurse.

“Matthias, can I talk to you when you’re done?” He was just leaving a session with his patient so I knew he'd be able to talk.

“Oh Assistant Director, how can I help?”

“Penn is fine, I wanted to ask about your request to move Arthur Matthews and your reasoning, it seems severe to move him into a padded room, let alone after only 5 days.”

“I see that, but trust me I think it’s necessary.”

“Being suicidal hardly seems like enough reason to-”

“Suicidal doesn't even begin to fully explain what this guy is. I’ve worked with patients with bizarre delusions twice as erratic and anxious as him that have less of a death wish.”

“How many suicide attempts in the past week could possibly justify this kind of move?”

“19, Doctor. 19 times.” I stood still for a few seconds until I caught my mouth agape. I was stunned, partially because it was surprising that I hadn't heard anything about this for the entire week, but mostly because 19 suicide attempts in a week seemed literally impossible. Suicide attempts are usually exhausting, and people will usually have fair amounts of time between them no matter how suicidal they are.

“Are you sure you aren’t exaggerating, Matthias? If you feel like you’re emotionally attached to this-”

“I’m not. I promise. We’ve tried restraining him, removing implements, hell we put him even in a straitjacket. The man is **bent** on ending his own life, he says he HAS to wake up.” I sighed. I could tell he was stressed out, and while he seemed erratic and frustrated, he didn't seem like he would have any reason to lie. But 19 times in one week was a lot, I’d experienced… determined patients before, but this was an entirely new level.
 
“Look,” I said with a sigh, “if you’d like, I can remove you from his case and make my own judgment about how to treat him.” I was one of the few people in the hospital with both an M.D. and a Ph.D. in Psychology, so I had no trouble taking over for him outside of my other duties as Assistant Director. He exhaled deeply, almost seeming defeated.

“That might be best.”

“I’ll get it done.” I started to step away when he said one last thing.

“Listen Penn,” he almost whispered it, stuttering and looking around like he was afraid. Or maybe just worried. “Something is wrong. I know that sounds obvious, but I mean wrong. He… he means something. Take the warning.” He walked away in a hurry before I could ask him what that could possibly mean. 

I went home that night, sat on my couch, and started mentally preparing myself from whatever nightmare could possibly make Matthias act that way. For whatever reason, I ran through what few interactions I’d gone through with him. He was polite, but not strangely so, and for whatever reason, I couldn’t help but feel distinct comfort in his personality. Thinking about why, however, scared me a little bit. I knew there was no real reason I’d feel any different about him, he was another patient of the dozens I’ve met over the years, but something just felt different. I wanted to say familiar, but that doesn't seem right. It was almost like déjà vu, I felt distinctly aware that nothing about him was particularly reminiscent of anyone or anything I’d met before, but my mind still had that fog of uncertainty, like maybe I *should* be recognizing him. 

I took a deep breath, I can’t be letting Matthias’ words get to me. I checked the time. 

9:30

Fuck me. I let time get away from me. I grabbed a bowl of cheerios and my laptop and sat back down to read Matthias’ notes on Arthur. He’d emailed me some notes that he thought would be pertinent to my care of him. I’ll copy the important parts here.

Day 1
Arthur Matthews has been diagnosed with severe delusional disorder, presenting with an extreme delusional belief that he is presently dreaming. This has resulted in a seemingly inextinguishable desire to end his life, an action that his delusion demands as the sole way of waking up. As of seven thirty PM, he has attempted to end his own life four times, despite being treated to prevent such attempts and being directly supervised. I’ll be attempting talk therapy, but I have a slight worry that it may be ineffective at preventing his suicidal thoughts, but it is too soon to tell if that can change. 

His most common method for killing himself seems to be cutting himself, presumably in an attempt to bleed himself out. Why he’d choose an arguably very painful and messy method is uncertain, I presume it might simply be the easiest or most obvious. I’ve yet to learn enough about him to pinpoint a reasoning. However, in addition to the three attempts to cut his arms, abdomen, and neck open, he also was found attempting to gouge his eyes out, scratching his eyes using a piece of metal wire before being restrained and sedated by nurses. He was found with severe scratching on his sclera, with surprisingly minimal damage to the cornea. I don’t expect his vision to be severely diminished, but I’ve instructed those watching over him to watch him closely, we still aren’t sure where the wire came from. 

Day 2
There was another incident last night, Arthur was seen trying to bite his own tongue, presumably to either drown himself in the blood or choke on it. Nearby staff noticed immediately and stopped him, however, he did sustain injuries to his tongue. His speech has been affected and there is noticeable wincing when he eats or drinks. I’ve directed staff to have at least two people watching him at once. Joel says it’s unnecessary and that one man can sedate him easily, but I won’t be taking chances. 

I spoke to him again today, this time more closely than yesterday’s more cursory and introductory session. By the time our session began, it was two-thirty, and he’d attempted suicide twice since the night before, both of which were causing enough bleeding to lose consciousness, the second being in the infirmary itself using a tongue depressor of all things. Below is an audio recording of the conversation, in his room in the infirmary.
[I’ll add a transcription here with some of my personal notes]

M: So, Arthur

A:  Ah, Doctor Matthias, you again. I take it that I won’t be seeing Penn much more, will I?

M: No, she was only there to oversee your transition.

A: She do that with all the patients?

M: No, but she tries to as often as she can.

A: Excellent, proper woman, that one.

M: I’d like to talk to you about this belief you have.

A: Delusion you mean.

M: Do you think of it as a delusion?

A: Of course not, but I assumed you did so I thought it’d move the conversation along (chuckle) I guess that didn’t work considering I’ve been here talking for a solid thirty seconds now

M: How would you describe it?

A: It’s just my reality.

M: And how long has this been your reality?

A: Quite some time, it’s the only way I exist here.

M: Here?

A: This world.

M: Your dream.

A: I suppose it could be thought of that way. 

M: Not a dream?

A: I don’t really consider it in any particular way, I just know I plan to wake up.

M: So when do you think you first fell asleep?

A: [no reply, I noticed distinct hesitation here]

M: Younger, older, perhaps as a child even?

A: I can’t quite place it.

M: But you know you are in fact asleep.

A: Yes, I’m fairly certain of it, but I guess that’s why I’m here isn’t it (more chuckling).

M: How can you be so sure of that?

A: Things don’t add up here. 

M: Oh?

A: Things keep...changing. Facts, ideas, things I *know* were different before. Kind of like that Mandela Effect crap, although I’m pretty sure Berenstain was always spelled with an ‘a’. [laughs]

M: And you’re sure that these differences mean you’re asleep?

A: No. I keep having these… tears.

M: [noted rustling, as if that got his attention] tears?

A: Things look strange. Wrong. I can’t explain it. It’s like looking at a corner and realizing there are too many degrees for it to look like it does, but your eyes see it anyway. [Not sure if this example has any significance or if it was just a really creative way to express it]

M: Can you elaborate on that?

A: I don’t know how to describe it. It’s just… unclear. It’s like my eyes are constantly focusing while everything in my rational brain tells me it’s incorrect.

M: Interesting, are there any abnormal things you’re seeing that are distinct? Describable?

A: No. It feels more like a sensation at this point.

M: And you’re sure this means that this isn’t real?

A: [deep sigh. The next words he said were the first I’d heard without his usual cheery and generally friendly demeanor, instead taking on one of dejection and worry.] Look I know, this is going to sound crazy.

M: Nothing sounds crazy, that not a word we use here. You’re not going to-

A: It will. I’m telling you that. And as a psychologist I get that you have to understand what disorder you think I have. So I know I’m going to sound delusional.

M: If you know then why not hide it? Why not try to appear sane?

A: I have no reason to lie. I don’t want to be dishonest. There’s a.. a message? No a conversation. Something in these tears, these sensations or whatever you can call them. I can’t describe it, but it’s there, no words, but the meaning is there.

M: Conversation? Between whom?

A: I have no clue. But I hear them, understand them. “They’ve been asleep for a while, they need to wake up”, “You need to wake them up.” “A sign, some sign to tell them to wake up might work.” Those are the most coherent I can remember at least.

M: I see. Well I’m very sorry but unfortunately I don’t have much time left, I have other matters to attend to right now, but I’m very interested in hearing about these conversations and the details you’ve seen change next time we talk. Is there anything else you want to discuss while I’m here?

A: No, I’ll be fine. Thank you, Doctor, even if you think I’m crazy. I’ve never actually said this stuff out loud before.

M: Of course. Have a nice day, and ask us if you need anything else. 

[Recording ends.]

I consider the discussion Arthur and I had to be very productive, and I certainly plan to continue talk therapy with him at a later date. I’ve no definite theories, but I believe there’s a chance that Arthur underwent some severe trauma that resulted in his conscious convincing himself that he is asleep, and that the dialogues he’s hearing are memories of the event. I presume rape or something similar given the content of the conversations that he mentioned. The use of the pronoun ‘them’ is curious, but I’ve no leading theories as to whether that is even significant, let alone what it may mean.

Day 3
I have heard of no attempts on his own life by Arthur last night, which I consider to be great progress. I initially expected him to be tired, but upon meeting with him again, he seemed quite lucid, awake, and happy actually. We did not speak as in-depth today, but I am quite confident that he is improving as a result of the talk therapy, as simple as it may be, simply having someone to talk to might be causing him to improve considerably. Regardless, he expressed some relief and a calm that I didn’t realize was absent before. [Why he didn’t include the recording here is beyond me.]

Day 4
Arthur has improved, in fact, he may be overcoming his delusions entirely. I believe I can help him recover fully. Nothing but good signs.

Day 5
I shouldn’t have let you take his case. He’s fine, just let him be, or assign another doctor his care. Don’t worry about it. I really cannot stress enough that you shouldn’t try to work with him.

---

I tried calling Matthias, no answer. The wording of the last three entries was obviously very strange. Something else seemed incredibly off to me, I don’t know why. It almost reminded me of Arthur’s description of the angles in the corner. Like it was right there in front of me but I couldn’t see it, my head wouldn’t let me. The last entry was obviously written directly for me, I don’t know if two before that were as well. I assume the weird characters are just something in the file that got corrupted, but the shortness of that section makes me think it likely wasn’t important. Still, I’m confused by the reports, I plan on asking him what’s going on tomorrow.

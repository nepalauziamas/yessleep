When I was 7 - 10, I lived in a small flat, just across from some shops, living with my mother, cat, and dog. The place was perfect. Gas station down the road, pharmacy up the hill, dairy, dominos, bar, liquor store, and a supermarket just across a calm road. We lived there for years, and today I'm going to share with you an experience I had that chilled be to the core, that happened when I was only 9. My mother had told me about how she could sometimes see ghosts, and how a specific ghost would stand at the end of her bed, and how my brother had a ghost follow and torment him for years and years. I never believed her, and I regretted it. I have asthma, it's pretty bad so I have to constantly clear my throat; which means I make all sorts of noises so I can just breathe. One night, I needed to clear my throat. It was maybe 10:30pm to 11:00pm and so I decided to just do it and hope I didn't wake my mother just down the hall. I clear my throat, and suddenly I can't move. My heart races and the corners/edges of my eyes darken. I hear something storming down the hall, and a shadowy figure stomps in, pushes itself into my face raising an index finger and loudly goes "SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH". It now stomped off and I just fell asleep. The next morning, I attempted to tell my mother about the experience but I immediately broke down in tears. Once I managed to form the words, she just told me it's sleep paralysis. That I shouldn't worry because it couldn't hurt me; but something about that experience felt too real.

Now, a couple years later, I still can't stop thinking about it. Sometimes recovering pieces of it or recreating it in my head and getting a better visual of the shadow. All I can make out is that it seemed to be female, maybe 5"10, and had an aura of eeriness following it around. I sometimes recover false memories, things I know didn't happen during the experience - like me lunging at it and then just not remembering anything past lunging. I've also had scarier "Dreams" at younger ages.

I was maybe 5 - 6, maybe even 7. I awoke in my bed, the room filled with bright mellow yellow light and a sort of speaker bolted to the wall and ceiling (kind of like where they meet). I began crying for my mom, and a voice over the speaker bellowed "You'll never find her!" And made fun of me as I scrambled out of bed and cried for her. I kept trying to wake up, but I couldn't. I knew it was a dream, but I felt trapped. Unable to leave. The door burst open and (for context, I was extremely scared of COD: Blackops 2 zombies) a zombie resembling the features of a Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 Zombie stormed inside and lunged at me. It was that moment I suddenly woke up. It was terrifying. Sometimes I wonder if they're dreams, or attempts to trap me in \*something\*, because they don't feel like dreams the moment you can't open your eyes...

Edit: I now sleep with night lights on, and my door almost closed, just enough I can't see the hallway, sometimes even closing it altogether. I always make sure my closet is closed, and I'm not only facing one direction when sleeping. I hate my brain, and I always will. Sure, with the bright night lights on I wake up with sore eyes, but it's better than never waking up.  


Edit 2: This is a true story, just so you guys know. It's not fake for karma, it's original, and I can tell you off by heart the details of what the 1st storys creature looked like. Both of these experiences were horrifying, and I still remember how trapped I felt when I realised I couldn't wake myself up. How useless my crying, screaming, yelling and pleas for help were. How silent whatever came out of my mouth suddenly sounded. How paralyzed I felt...

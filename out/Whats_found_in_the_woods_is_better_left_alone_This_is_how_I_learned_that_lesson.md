I never thought that I’d get to where I am today. That’s not to say that I’m not grateful to be alive, mind you. It’s to say that there have been things in my life that weren’t exactly typical. I’ve lived a life full of oddities and strange happenings, so my trajectory hasn’t been what one could call predictable.

In short, there are things out there that are far beyond what we consider natural; vile beings and strange objects that break the rules of reality as we know it. These things are everywhere, you just don’t see them. It’s not for a lack of trying, either, so don’t get any ideas about becoming the next big witch hunter or anything like that. No, these things want to remain hidden. They want to lurk in your dreams and hide in your shadows, for if they are touched by the light, if they are known by the waking mind, they will cease to exist. It is in their nature to be odd, and so contact with mundanity interferes with their existence. That’s what I’ve learned through my strange, strange life.

This is why I’m writing this. This isn’t a memoir, or an attention seeking post to some odd website so that I can be internet famous. No, this is an attack. The more these things are known, the less power they have over the world and those who live in it. I’ve seen far too much for it all to win, so this is my last go around at trying to warn the people of what is lurking just out of their lines of sight. This is how I first learned of what’s hiding in your minds, waiting to pounce when you fall asleep. This is how it all started for me, and hopefully how it’ll all end for them.

The day it all started was like any other. A summer afternoon in Portland was bearable, so I could spend the day outside like I normally did. It was a passtime for my brother, sister and I to go ‘exploring’ along the nearest hiking trail. We knew it wasn’t really exploring, because everything was mapped out, but we liked to pretend that we were intrepid adventurers in the days of Christopher Columbus who had joined him on his quest to find new lands.

I was fourteen at the time, my sister being thirteen and my brother being sixteen. Mason, my brother, was always the creative one of us, cooking up a plotline for our make-believe adventure. Kara, my sister, was always itching for excitement in the dullness of summer, so readily followed whatever Mason came up with. I, on the other hand, was just tagging along for the most part. I knew that they liked making up stories and finding new caves and structures in the woods, so I went with them to be part of their fun. It was one of the only things that we did as a family unit, so I wasn’t about to miss that.

That was how we found ourselves walking along the path that we’d slowly been carving through the woods all summer. We’d been working our way through the woods and leaving small waypoints for ourselves along the way so that we couldn’t get lost, and could find the way to continue at a later date. Mason had declared that he’d find treasure, and Kara had quickly gotten on board with the idea, so we’d all begun to play along with the narrative that we were pirates looking for lost gold in the woods. It was something that had brought us together, and we’d gotten a few hundred feet into the woods and away from the trail. It was strange, being at a point where you couldn’t see the trail anymore, but knowing you were safe regardless. It was as if we were putting ourselves in danger without danger really being present, due to the waypoints. Perhaps that was what gave Mason and Kara their kicks.

“Mark!” Kara called. I’d been off in my own head again, wondering about things instead of enjoying them. I had to be brought back down like that often, and I could tell it was starting to get on peoples’ nerves.

“Sorry. What is it?” I asked.

I noticed that I’d fallen behind, and quickly jogged to catch up. As I approached my siblings, I felt the crunch of leaves and sticks under my boot. That, too, served to ground me further, even nature wanting to keep my head below those pesky clouds. I saw that the two of them were kneeling down and looking at something, talking about it with each other under their breaths. I stood there for a moment, waiting for them to follow through on calling me over, but quickly lost my patience with them.

“What?” I asked again, letting my arms bat against my sides as I huffed in annoyance.

“Look at this,” Mason said, skirting back so that I could see what they were looking at.

It was a line of beige. No, *sand*. I’d seen the color beige before, but not in nature. It took me a moment to recognize that it was sand, as we rarely went to the beach and I didn’t watch movies at that age. I looked at it, and was wondering where it had come from when I noticed Kara looking away from it and deeper into the woods . As I traced her gaze, I saw that the sand went further than I’d thought, trailing off the path we’d been making and disappearing into the woods. That was odd, and I quickly turned the other way to see if it went to the left as well, and found that it did. What a strange thing to find in the woods; a line of sand leading off into who knows where. Knowing Mason and Kara, I knew that they’d want to follow it to see where it goes, and quickly tried to shut it down.

“We probably shouldn’t mess with it,” I said, using Mason to prop myself up and rise to my feet once more.

“Why not?” Kara asked, her eyebrows knitting together in clear disappointment. It was written all over her face, from the slight pout, to the way she let her shoulders sag, that she wanted to see what it meant.

“We don’t know where it leads. It could be dangerous,” I said, torn between whether putting my hand on her shoulder would be comforting or awkward, as neither of us were particularly fond of physical affection.

“It could be treasure!” Mason exclaimed, his eyes lighting up as he smiled wide.

“That’s pretend. This is real. We all agreed not to leave the path for safety. What if we follow it, but the wind picks up to blow the line away, and then we have no way of knowing the way back home? There’s a dozen things wrong with following a random line in the woods drawn with sand,” I shot back.

“Don’t be such a wet blanket. Let’s go, Kara. We’ll be able to find our way back, no problem,” Mason said.

I glared at him as he looked both ways up the sand trail and paused for a moment. I looked over at Kara to see if she was really going to buy into that, and saw that her eyes were wide and bright, and her smile was back. I realized that they were really going to do this, and wondered if I should really put a stop to it if Mason was that confident in his ability to find his way back. I checked what I had on me, and found my cell phone, over a dozen of the markers that we used as waypoints, the case for my glasses and the water bottle that I’d brought all stuffed into the backpack I was wearing. I looked back at my siblings and sighed. I shouldn’t have enabled them like that, but if they were going to do this, I could at least make sure they were safe about it.

“If we’re doing this, I’ll keep placing markers so we can retrace our steps. Okay?” I said.

“Yeah, sure. Hear that, Kara? We’re in business,” Mason said, tracing along the sand line with his eyes.

Kara smiled, and I thought that it would probably be worth it just for that. Mason immediately set off down the trail. Kara followed closely behind, which left me to pick up the pace as I slipped my backpack around and grabbed the markers from their pocket so that I could light the way, as it were. I’d come up with the waypoint system as Mason had been planning our little expedition at the beginning of that summer.

Our grandfather used to make flags before he passed away, so we had an abundance of them lying around. We’d asked for permission from our parents to use them as markers for our project, and had been able to get our hands on a few dozen squares of multicolored fabric, and we started nailing them to trees every so often to keep ourselves safe from getting turned around and lost in the woods. I thought it was a pretty good system, and the others had come around to it after their initial booing, but it did have some kinks. Some flags were just green, so we couldn’t use those due to their similarities to natural leaves. Some of them got shredded by a bird interested in the color, so we usually had a few to replace every time we ventured along our homemade trail. It was worth it, though, for safety.

As the three of us trekked through the woods, I tried to focus on the snapping of twigs and crunching of leaves under us as we stepped through the uncharted territory. It was about midday, so the beams of white shining through gaps in the gaps in the treetops were able to light the surroundings well enough that we could see. We followed the sand trail deeper into the woods, so far that we could no longer see where we started from at the end of our makeshift path. I kept sticking our markers to trees along the way, but I’d run out soon. We usually only took a handful each, making for about twenty five in total, but I was going to run out if we kept up the pace we were going at.

I went to ask if Mason wanted to slow down, or even just turn back, but I was kept from speaking as Mason stepped through a collection of large leaves and trees to something that made him laugh like a madman. Kara and I shared a look, and she stepped through as well, getting the same result; manic laughter. I felt the soles of my feet burn from so much walking, but decided that I couldn’t leave them alone. I stepped through the barrier and came out in a clearing.

The clearing was quiet, tranquil like a wilderness paradise you’d see in a kid’s movie. It was within a wide circular fence, for lack of a better word, of leaves and trees. That foliage kept everything out, it seemed, as there weren’t any animals or unsightly growths in this clearing. The ground was mostly dirt, with grass growing all over. The corner across from us, however, was rock. That corner was host to a pond, a stream running from further in the woods to the basin of stone to become a pool.

It seemed that Mason was drawn over to the pond, as he’d worked up quite the sweat in getting there. He ran over to the pond and leapt into it, splashing around in the water as it drenched him. I frowned at the thought of moving around once he had to get out, but let Mason have his fun. It’d be his problem to deal with, anyway.

Kara, on the other hand, was captivated by the place as a whole, guessing from the look of slack jawed wonder on her face. Kara took her shoes off and began to walk around on the grass. I was momentarily worried about any thorns or prickly bushes that might have been hiding in the grass, but my fears were dissuaded by the ease with which Kara stepped through the grass.

I remained near the spot we’d entered through. I wasn’t one for playing around in the elements, you see, so I chose to sit on the grass and observe. I was often an observer, so I suppose that I’d gotten good at looking at the little things, things that may not have added up to one cohesive whole. I looked around the clearing we’d stumbled into while my siblings played, and found a number of oddities that didn’t quite have reasonable explanations. Things such as the complete lack of noise coming from anything but my brother and sister. You could always hear *something* in the woods, but now there was absolutely no sound whatsoever. It was as if someone had gone and snuffed out every little bird, every cricket and even made sure that the leaves didn’t fall so that no sound could disturb this paradisian area.

The second strange thing I found was that the grass grew completely evenly all around the clearing. Everywhere grass could grow, it did grow, and that rubbed me the wrong way. I’d seen the way our lawn looked when Dad let up on the landscaping for a few weeks, and this was not that. It was like someone had very specifically tried to get the grass to grow in this way so that it looked perfect. That gave me a bad feeling, and I made a note to not kick up any of it when I moved.

The last thing that gave me an odd sort of feeling was that I began to feel something the longer I was in there. It started the very moment I stepped through that foliage, but I didn’t truly register it until much later, over twenty minutes after we’d all entered. It was a distinct lack of comfort. No matter what I did, where I sat or how I held myself, I couldn’t get comfortable. It was as if something about this place was keeping me on edge, but I couldn’t pinpoint what could do that.

I got up after a while and started walking around, trying to pinpoint what exactly was making me feel this *off*, but I couldn’t find anything that would make me uncomfortable, at least on a conscious level. Maybe I was just nervous that we’d changed plans and that we were off the path. That made sense, but if it were that, I thought that I would’ve known it and been able to recognize that it was just nerves. It had to be something different.

There was about half an hour between us entering and my realization that someone was watching me. That had to be it. I felt eyes on me from behind, and was sure *that* was the feeling that I’d been getting from this place. This was someone’s home, and that person knew we were there. Feeling bold, I spun around and tried to see who was watching me, but nothing was there. I tried my best to turn in a circle so that I could catch whoever it was, as they had to have been fast to get away that quick. I didn’t manage to see anything, but I did succeed in making myself dizzy and almost tripping myself up, needing to support myself with a hand on the rock I’d been sitting on to avoid falling over.

I felt my heart begin beating harder in my chest, and I knew something was wrong. I still felt those eyes on me, but now it was more intense, like they’d been hiding before but were letting me know that they were there, now. A cold trickle of sweat ran down the back of my neck at that thought, and I began to wonder what kind of person could cause me to feel this way. I gripped the straps of my backpack tightly and began to back away from where I’d been standing.

My siblings were still playing in the pond. I began to make my way over to them, the feeling that something was *wrong* still increasing in my gut. It felt like something was squeezing my torso very gently, but that gentleness wasn’t going to last. The grip of this feeling was gaining strength, and I was powerless to stop it. I walked over to Mason and Kara, who looked up at me with large, smug smiles.

“How’s this, huh?” Mason asked, shooting at me with finger guns.

“Join us!” Kara yelled, pumping her fists in a way that made water splash up at me.

I flinched away from the water and frowned at my siblings. Taking a deep breath, I forced myself to remain calm. Freaking out and making myself look crazy wouldn’t get anything done. I needed to explain this calmly and rationally in order for them to take me seriously.

“I think there’s someone here. I don’t think they’re nice. We need to leave,” I said between measured breaths with my strangled lungs.

“Did you see them?” Kara asked, rising slightly out of the water to look around with a frown.

Mason looked at me with a raised eyebrow and a face that told me he was *not* impressed. I silently pleaded with him to believe me, feeling my heart beat like wild in my chest as the feeling of being watched became almost too much to ignore. It made me want to run far away from there, and never return. It was as if some outside force was guiding my thoughts, and it was taking a lot from me to railroad my mind into staying on the one thing in front of me; my brother.

“No, but I think they see us. This must be their home, which means we can’t be here,” I said, feeling my hands begin to lose their grip on my backpack and shake once more.

“You didn’t see anyone, but you think there’s someone around here. Did you hear them?” Mason asked, raising an eyebrow at me as he leaned back in the water.

“No. I … felt that they were watching me,” I said, realizing how unbelievable that sounded as I spoke.

“You *felt* them? Don’t just say things to mess with Kara,” Mason said, his small smile dropping to a frown as he seemed to examine me.

I felt my veins go cold, but not because of the presence that was still slowly squeezing the life out of me. Sitting there in the pool, my own brother had dismissed me as a liar. I’d never lied before, I’d never seen the use of it, so how could Mason believe that I was suddenly one to make up stories? I’d prided myself on my honesty and a care for my siblings, but was that connection I felt with my brother only one way? Did he not respect me enough to see that I was freaking out in this hidden grove that we’d found ourselves in? I felt it was fairly obvious that I was in the grips of a panic attack at that moment, with my hyperventilation, my shaking hands and my high, wavering voice. I admit that it may be with hindsight that I’m able to make these claims, but a good brother would’ve been able to see those signs as clearly as I do now. A better brother than Mason had been, at least.

“We need to leave. Come on,” I said, taking Kara’s hand in my own and turning to leave.

“Hey!” Kara yelped as I dragged her along.

I felt a tugging behind me, but carried on with my plan to get my sister and I out of there. Mason could do whatever he wanted, if it was his wish. I, however, couldn’t let my younger sister be in that place any longer, as the restriction I felt on my lungs was growing tighter and tighter as she flailed her way out of the pool to meet me on the grass and keep up with my dragging hand.

We only managed a few steps out onto the grass before a deafening silence fell upon us. In the moment, I thought it was my shallow breathing that was causing my senses to fade as my consciousness dimmed, but as the seconds went on, both Kara and I frozen in place on the grass as the silence drew on, I knew it wasn’t that I was finally succumbing to whatever influence this place had on me. This was something different.

I looked back at Kara to see that she was looking around with wide, unfocused eyes. She was scared, I could tell just from looking at her. I felt the hand I had taken start shaking, and her grip strangled my own hand as we stopped moving in in light of this new development. I shifted my gaze over to Mason, who was staring at one thing with an odd focus that he didn’t usually have. He’d stopped moving, the water coming to rest with him, and so it truly was silent. I was breathing, and I sure as hell had heard my heartbeat before, but now there was nothing. It was sickening to have that ringing in my ears that only came when everything was still, and I needed it to end.

“What?” I asked, the easiest way to stop the silence and get answers.

Mason didn’t reply, he just raised his hand out of the water, bringing the nerve-settling sounds of water sloshing around, to point at something that was now behind me. I felt my heartbeat quicken once again as I felt the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end, a strange feeling of morbid curiosity washing over me. What could Mason have been pointing at? Was it whatever was behind the force pushing me to act as I was? Could he see it? At that moment, I had all these questions and more, and came to the conclusion that the only way to find out was to turn around and see for myself, and that was exactly what I did.

What I was met with was not what I was expecting. It was a woman, about middle aged with long dark hair and no color in her eyes. She wore a long, dirty dress and had long, well maintained fingernails. She stood barefoot on the grass, looking at us with a small smirk on her face as she placed her hands upon her hips in what was probably meant to be intimidating, because that’s what it did to me. The image of this woman, covered in dirt and filth, yet elegant and beautiful in a way I couldn’t describe completely, sent a shock through my system and I let out a gasp as the ringing silence abruptly vanished.

“Hello, children,” she said, her voice impossibly smooth. It was like a melody, only her intonation didn’t change as she spoke. It was odd and contradictory, but it also made complete sense at the time. It threw me for a loop for a moment, but that moment was all it took for Mason to stand up and trudge over to Kara and I.

“Don’t talk to her,” Mason whispered, stepping in front of me to shield the two of us from something. I wasn’t entirely sure of what Mason was thinking at that moment, but it couldn’t have been good. “We were just about to leave,” he said.

“Oh, but you’ve just arrived. Surely you haven’t enjoyed everything my grove has to offer. I see you’ve made use of my pool,” she said, gesturing to the scene of two drenched kids standing next to each other.

Mason began walking toward the tree line that would take us out of the grove. He pulled Kara and I along with him, and the three of us started making our way away from the woman. That was, until she laughed. Instead of the sound of a light, breezy giggle coming from in front of us, the noise came from behind. The three of us whipped around and saw that another of the same woman was sitting on the ledge of the pool, looking at us expectantly. I looked back at the original to find that she was gone, causing me to gasp lightly. It was the same woman, then, just in a different place.

“How’d you get over there?” Mason asked, stepping in front of Kara and I yet again as all three of us started backing away from the woman.

“Some things are better left unknown, for now,” the woman said, standing to her full height, towering over all of us kids, as she hummed in a low voice that was so unlike her previous demeanor that it made my head spin.

As I looked behind myself to see where we were going, I realized that we were heading toward the opening we’d come through when we’d first arrived. I felt my mind focus on that one spot, the place where the shrubbery parted slightly so that I could see a few feet into the woods. I tugged on Mason’s arm as I realized this, getting him to look over at our exit point for just a moment before the woman drew our attention yet again.

“You’re going to make this difficult, children, but you are in luck. I happen to be in a forgiving mood. Now, come closer to me so that we can talk,” she said, smiling and speaking in that off puttingly sweet tone of voice.

None of us said anything. From Mason’s labored breaths and Kara’s uncharacteristic quietness, it seemed like the strange effect this place had on me had begun to take hold with my siblings. I didn’t know who this woman was, or what this place was doing to us, but I knew that we needed to leave. I glanced at our exit point once again and started to think of a plan. The woman’s eyes bored into the back of my head as I turned away from her, but I pushed her out of my thoughts and focused on moving as quickly as possible while the others were dragged behind me.

As I did this, however, I felt that it was a little easier to breathe. My mind was clearer and air flowed quicker when I deliberately ignored the woman’s presence, but it seemed like that was only for as long as I maintained that train of thought, because it was as soon as I realized that it must have been because of *her* that I was feeling this way, not the grove itself, that these effects began to creep up on me yet again.

I tugged on Mason and Kara’s hands yet again, whispering, “Ignore her and you’ll feel better.”

“What are you talking about?” Kara asked, her hand shaking mine for comfort.

“I don’t think she’s a normal person,” I said, and Mason nodded his agreement after a moment of hesitation.

Mason looked torn. He had the look in his eyes that told me of want. It was clear that even a small part of him wanted to stay and enjoy whatever that woman had in store for us, for *him*. I had seen that look on his face before, when he was forced to stop playing and come to bed when we’d been younger. It was an expression that he was fighting so hard to keep off his face, because he was obviously trying to be strong in this situation, even if he wasn’t feeling as strong as he let on. It was a few more steps until Mason was able to get himself under control, showing Kara and I a determined smile that caused Kara to not squeeze our hands so hard.

“Okay, guys. Just listen to my voice, and focus on the ground ahead of you and we’ll be fine. Turn around now,” Mason said, leading the two of us in turning away from the woman and facing our exit.

The three of us started walking toward the exit, that parting of bushes that we’d entered through. I could feel something behind us, something that was cold and dark and angry. It felt like the temperature behind the three of us had dropped by dozens of degrees, but we kept on walking away from the woman. Footsteps made me flinch, squeezing Mason’s hand tighter, but he kept his grip and spoke up.

“So, what do you two want for dinner?” Mason asked.

When Kara didn’t say anything, I managed to stutter out, “Fish.”

“Oh, fish, eh? Good choice. It’s been a while since we’ve had fish, so I can’t blame you,” Mason said, sounding as if everything was normal and that they were simply having a conversation like any other day.

We were only a few steps away from the bushes, and then we’d be out of the grove. We were only feet away when the woman’s voice rang out in a shrieking pitch that made my head hurt. I heard Mason curse under his breath, but laugh it off. I was tempted to look back, but I remembered that ignoring her was the key to breaking out of whatever spell she and this place had put them under.

“Come back, children. I’ve got so many fun activities to share with you. Why don’t you stop playing and come back over here so that I can dry you off after playing in the pool? Hello? I know you can hear me! Children? Children! Come back here or else! I command it! *Come back*!” the woman wailed, each beg and plea for us to stay resonating so deeply within me that it made my bones ache. As she cried out for us, the woman’s voice changed and became deeper, more aggressive, and grating on my ears. I didn’t dare look back to see how she’d managed to sound like that.

As the three of us stepped through the boundary of the grove, it was like a line being cut while fishing. There was a tension within me that was instantly relieved as we set foot on the messy ground of the woods. The woman’s voice was immediately silenced, which caused me to gasp as the pressure I’d felt building in my head and the aching of my bones came to an end. It was as if everything that place had been doing to us simply stopped as soon as we took one step out of that grove. The relief was so overwhelming that my legs failed me for a moment, and I fell to the ground.

“Get back up. We need to get home,” Mason said, dragging me up from the ground.

Leaves crunched and twigs snapped as we bolted away from the grove. I dared a look back to see that nothing was there. There wasn’t even a treeline that was blocking view, there was simply no trace of a grove ever having been there. It looked like any other part of the woods, and that threw me off my step enough for Mason to once again drag me behind himself as we ran from the grove.

It took a while for us to find our way back to the main path, but we eventually gathered our bearings enough to navigate through the woods. We came upon my markers, and I felt a pang of relief wash over me when we did. I remember thanking any higher power that may have existed for giving me the foresight to come up with the waypoint system, but my mind was too preoccupied with the grove and that woman to think on that any further.

The grove had just disappeared as soon as we’d left it. How? Had it ever really been there? It had to have been, since my siblings had experienced the same things I had. Who was that woman? Had she been a person, or just another of the grove’s tricks? Or were they *her* tricks? It was all unclear, and it hurt my head to think about it any deeper than ‘that was weird’ as we sprinted through the woods and came out at the trailhead near our home. We got home as fast as possible and collapsed inside, scaring our parents half to death.

We tried to tell them what had happened, but they chalked it up to Mason’s wild imagination when Kara went to her room as soon as she could and it hurt my head too much to corroborate anything Mason was saying beyond nodding and writing things down, but they’d already dismissed everything that he was saying before I could get anything meaningful down on paper. The two of us tried to tell them for hours, but we just got praise for inventing such a cohesive storyline this time around. Mason went to bed early, demoralized by his failings to get our parents to understand.

I didn’t sleep that night. I stayed up, wondering what the hell had happened that day and wondering if it had ever happened before, if it would happen again, and if it happened anywhere else. That was the day I learned that the world had a little more magic than what I always assumed. The first time I came into contact with an entity beyond my understanding was so close to being something bad for my siblings and I, but a display of courage from my brother and a streak of foresight saved us from whatever fate that woman in the woods had planned for us. Sometimes, I still think about what she wanted for us, and if any other kids had fallen for her tricks and gotten caught in her trap. I never saw her again, but she haunts my dreams as the first time I learned that the world was far bigger than I ever imagined it to be.

Nobody believed me, but I knew. So did Mason and Kara. We knew what was out there, what was possible, and that had forged a bond between us so strong that it still persists to this day. We’re older than we were when this happened, but I can tell you this: for all that the world is understood more nowadays, the world isn’t any less weird or scary than when we knew nothing at all. I wonder if it was better when we were in the dark, sometimes.

So, be careful of what you find out there in the great unknown. It may be more than you bargained for. If not, well, there are plenty of [experiences](https://simily.co/members/dex_hopper04/) to draw on from for guidance.

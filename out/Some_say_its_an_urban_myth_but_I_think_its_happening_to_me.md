Some say it’s an urban myth, but I think it’s happening to me. Never in my wildest dreams (or nightmares really) would I have ever thought that this could actually happen to me, How could this happen to anyone?

When you start to get followed by a person, a stranger that appears everywhere you go and just smiles at you. It's an uncanny feeling of impending doom. It's that voice in your head screaming at you that something just isn't quite right. It's the intuition that kicks in and desperately pleads with your brain, telling you, "ya gotta get outta here man, RUN RUN RUN AS FAST YOU CAN" But what am I even running from? Delusions? Hallucinations? Or something much more real and much more sinsister?

 Everywhere I go there it is. Smiling at me in the corner. Everywhere I look, there it is, smiling at me in the distance. Every time I turn my head, there it is, Smiling at me, again and again and again. Even when I close my eyes, there it is, burnt into my brain, smiling at me from behind my eyelids. When I go to sleep at night, there it is, smiling at me in my dreams.

And it’s not always the same person. And I don’t even know if it’s real anymore. In fact, I'm starting to think it's not real, that it's just a figment of my deranged imagination, or a part of my fucked up subconscious.

It was when I was visiting a friend at work that I first noticed it. A woman  smiling menacing at me in the corner of his office.

“who is that?” I texted him from my phone.

He looked up from his phone notification and laughed, “what are you talking about?”

I was confused so I took a picture on my phone to send him discreetly, but the photo was empty, just an office  wall with no one standing there. I couldn't believe my eyes, I slapped my self across the face, pinched myself, thinking I was losing the ability to tell what was real and what wasn't. What if I walked over to her and touched her? Would I feel her there? Or would my hand just go through her? I was starting to really lose my cool, couldn't focus on anything but the woman in the corner...

And the woman continued to stare, and i swear she was looking right into the depths of my soul, her smile growing more evil with each passing moment. I couldn't stand looking at her, but at the same time I could not look away, it was enchanting almost, like the siren's cry that lures in the sailor, only to devour the soul of the fool foolish enough to be drawn to it.

“I need to go” I said before quickly rushing to the parking lot. I had to get out of there as fast I could, I didn't even really know why, I just knew I had to leave.

When I reached my car and got into the driver’s seat, the woman appeared again from two parking spaces over. The same stare. The same smile.

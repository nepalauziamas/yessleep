I’m writing this because I have to.

I’m obligated to.

I’m contracted to. 

Please read to the end.

Last night, a group of buddies and I planned a night fishing trip at our favorite hole on the Pigeon River. All my friends had to work late and I would be the first one there. 

The access to our spot is off of the closed down Lower Creek Road, and like any other night, I had gotten out of my truck and moved the “Closed Road” sign out of the way before putting it back once my truck was past. 

The night air felt hot and muggy as I placed the sign back. As I completed the task I had done a million times, a strange feeling of depression came over me. Depression is the best way I can explain it. At that moment, the idea of fishing with my friends didn’t excite me like it had in the past. 

I shook off my melancholy, got back in my truck, and took off down the old dirt road. My trip was highlighted by a strange site. About a quarter mile in and on the side of the road, a car sat at the edge of an old driveway and not just any driveway, it was the driveway to the Tillerman home. The site of an unsolved murder. The home was destroyed years ago but an old rusty mailbox still stands. The only numbers on the mailbox are 66 with the first number being scraped off. 

I decided the abandoned sedan was none of my concern and continued my trip. 

The sight of a blood-red tree on the right side of the road signaled that I had arrived. My friends and I spray paint the tree every other week as a way to identify the trailhead of the path that leads to the river. 

The quarter mile trail is curvy and heavily wooded and takes me no time to travers even with a couple fishing poles in hand and a heavy backpack on.

Once at the river’s bank, all three of my buddies texted, in near unison, that they had to cancel. Shocked by their out-of-character cancellation, I stared at my phone feeling devastated. I really needed their company tonight. I tossed my phone back into my pocket and looked out over the river. The whitecaps were illuminated by a bright full moon. The motion and sound of the river hypnotized me for a moment. I snapped out of my daze. *Screw it. I’m staying.*

It was now going on 10:30 pm. I decided I would stay til midnight since I had nothing to do in the morning. I took out my ground cushion, a tub of night crawlers and my electric lamp. After seating myself. I baited my hook and tossed out my line. 

Bam. A bite immediately. I reeled in the fish. A trout. Not bad. I tossed it back and for the next hour I am pulling them in left and right. 

At 11:30, I got an extra strong hit on my line. The pole almost flew from hand. I reeled and fought but whatever it is doesn’t budge. From the water, I started to hear a major commotion. Something huge thrashed around at the midway point of the wide river. As I went for my lantern, I dropped my pole which immediately shot into the water. I tried to calm myself as I tried to aim the light towards the thing in the water. 

As soon as my light found the spot of chaos, the thrashing stopped. I squinted my eyes to get a good look. My heart sunk to the ground. Sticking halfway out of the water was the head of a man. He made eye contact. My lantern turned off. 

I’m frozen. As my eyes adjusted to having only moonlight to work with, I could hear the man swimming towards me. 

I wanted to run so bad. But no matter what my body wouldn’t move. The man quickly closed the distance to the bank, and before I knew it he was climbing out of the water near me. 

With my eyes adjusted, I could make out that the man was well dressed. A shocking revelation after watching him come from the river. He laid face down on the bank for a moment, violently jerking every few seconds. Then abruptly, he rolled to his back and sat up. His head slowly turned to my direction before he made eye contact again. 

“Well, hey there,” he said with a pearly white grin. 

His handsome face was ghost white. His neat hair and nice suit, both jet black. 

“Okay, I guess you’re too shocked to talk,” he said as he gestured towards my fishing pole. “Can I borrow this?”

I just stare. No reply.

“Okay, thanks,” he said with a sarcastic sound.

He took the fishing rod, fished out a night crawler from the tub, baited the hook and tossed out the line. 

Instantly he landed a fish. “Hell, nice spot you got here, kid,” he said with an excited laugh. 

The man reeled the fish in and took it off the hook. He marveled at his catch for a second then slammed his face into it. His head shook back and forth like a wild animal ripping a bite from its prey. Drops of the fish’s blood splattered against my face. 

He threw his head back and swallowed. His throat pulsed as he made a strange sucking and wheezing sound. He tossed the remains of the fish back in the river and looked back at me. His face was a horrific scene of blood and gore. He smiled. 

“Okay, now that dinner is over, let’s talk business,” he said. “I’m sure this conversation is going to be one sided since you seem to be mute. That’s okay. I don’t need you to do anything but listen closely.”

He looked down at my electric lamp and snapped his fingers. The light came back on instantly.

“Sorry, I forgot I had turned that off,” he said with a chuckle. “Boy, I bet that was scary being out here in the dark with me. Please accept my apology.”

“Alright, let me introduce myself,” the man continued. “I’m Necare. Neigh like a horse. Care as in care for the elderly. Now, I’m from a place really far from here. You probably haven’t heard of it. The name you wouldn’t comprehend. Let’s just say, it’s a large mountain with a large hole in its side.”

Necare placed his hands together and made a circle with them. 

“Now that my background is out of the way, let’s talk about why I am here,” he said and leaned towards me. “I need you to spread a message for me. First off, I want people to know I exist. They are all going to think you’re crazy, but that doesn’t matter. I just want them to know my name.”

“Here is the second thing I want them to know, and this is important,” he continued as his face became blank and cold. “Things are about to become very bad here on earth. It’s going to get hotter. Food and water will become scarce. And the worst of mankind will lead every nation.”

His face twisted into an evil grin. 

“And here is the best part,” he said. “There are more things like me from that mountain. And we are out here looking and searching for people to take. Because there is something alive in that mountain, and it wants you all.”

With that he stood. He reached into his suit and pulled out a piece of paper. He unrolled it and revealed a document. 

“Now I am willing to spare you, if you sign this,” he said. “It’s a contract obligating you to tell everyone you come into contact with about what I said tonight. You must do this until you die.”

He stepped over me and I looked up at him. I was still too shocked to say anything. When I tried to speak, the words just came out in a mumbled mess. 

“Or you know, if you decide you’re not up to the task, I can just take this rock here and bash your fucking brains in,” he said reaching down for a large rock. 

I crawled back from him and nodded my head. 

“I. I. I’ll do it,” I got out. 

He took my finger and ran it through the fish blood and guts that still remained on his face. 

“Sign with your finger here,” he said pointing at the paper. “Just know, if you break this, you and your loved ones will beg and plead for death that will never come.”

I signed. 

He made his way back into the water and went under. 

So here I am now writing this. Please share this and tell everyone you can. 

Remember, they are out there, and it wants us all.

I visit this place probably twice a year. One for
touring during the spring, and another in the fall for the haunted house. Now I’m not going to say which asylum it is. But based on what I’m about to tell you, it will probably be pretty easy to figure out.

I love abandoned buildings, there’s some kind of aesthetic of seeing the past frozen in the present. All the money for tours and the haunted house go to restoring the hospital to its former glory. It makes me feel better about who owns the hospital isn’t doing it for the money, but for restoring history.

Now, I’ve been to the hospital many times, I brag about how close I live to it. But every time I go, a heaviness grows over me. Like a shadow. For those of you looking for a classic ghost spook story? This is the one to read. But I beg you, do NOT go there at night.

My family has always told me I’m sensitive. Not in a way where it’s easy to hurt my feeling s no, I feel things that just seem to be slightly out of place. The slightest temperature change or pressure in the air. I feel it, and I know it.

I started visiting the asylum when I was in high school. My thespian troupe had been hired to act in the haunted house. I was excited to go, but in the back of my mind I knew I wouldn’t last. 

I got there, had my makeup applied, and dressed up. Once we went to our spots I couldn’t do it. I constantly felt bad energy. That I wasn’t wanted there. I brought holy water and wore a cross. Now did I believe in God? Not at all. I’ve been an atheist my whole life. But having some sort of protection made me feel better. I lasted ten minutes in the old ward before leaving. My parents picked me up and I was quiet the entire ride home. What disturbed me was the  glass bottle of holy water I brought was broken. No I didn’t sit on it. It’s kinda hard to do that when it’s around your neck in a tiny bottle. My cross was also missing. I swore from that point on I wouldn’t return at night.

I only returned during the day for tours. But even then the presence wasn’t happy with me. There were several points where I felt something tug my shirt or a shove against my back. But I purposely stayed behind everyone in the group. I don’t see this as a gift. It scares me when I feel a dark entity. What drives me crazy is that my siblings want to do a night tour and overnight stay. Only those who don’t know or feel their surroundings would do that. People have left with claw marks in their skin but that doesn’t stop others. But the dead make sure you know they are not a force to be messed with and to stay out of their asylum.


Edit update: the asylum is bit further south than PA! But you all are real close! One of the most known murders happening in this hospital is a man killing his roommate by smashing the corner of a bed post into his skull until he was dead. There are still blood stains on the concrete that have been painted over.

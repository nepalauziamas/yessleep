I usually ignore them, they call like 20 times a day, even more. I can be at work and my boss will get mad at me because my phone keeps blowing up with all these spam calls. I should have never applied for any loans online, that’s usually how they get you, you enter your phone number, and they call you for life. When I would answer at least one of them, out of curiosity, they would stay silent for a long time then I guess they realized I answered and it would be some person from another country calling about health insurance or whatever, I would just hang up, sometimes I would even tell them not to call my number, but they never listened.

It was going on already for 2 months now when I decided I needed to change my number, I couldn’t change my number yet since my brother calls me from prison for money and this number is the only number he has to reach me so I couldn’t change it for that reason so I decided to just stick it out, until one night at around 11:30 at night, I got another spam call. Now usually they call during the day and not at night, I thought maybe they're in a different time zone as to the reason why they are calling so late, I decided to answer it. Hello I said in a upset voice for calling very late, they stayed silent like usual until I heard the voice

“Don’t hang up”.

“What do you mean” I asked. “Who’s this?”

“They’re coming, don’t open the door, they are coming tonight, if they knock at your door, don’t answer.”

I got up from bed.

"What? Who is this?”

They hanged up.

I quickly dialed the number back, it was a number from New York but when I called them back it said the number did not exist.

Who the fuck was that and why were they warning me.

Then that’s when I heard it. A LOUD, BANGING KNOCK ON MY DOOR. The loud banging was enough for me to shit my pants. Chills ran down my spine as the knocks continued for a good 2 minutes, they wouldn’t leave whoever they were. I hid in my closet just in case they wanted to break in, I called the cops right away and they sent someone over here.

By the time the cops came whoever had knocked had disappeared, I told them about the spam call I had gotten before, my next door neighbor Jacob came up to us when the cops were talking to me and said that two men were banging really hard at my door and it looked like they wanted to attack me since he said that one of them had a crowbar on them and a gun. I had never in my life been a target of anything, I never had enemies nor had anyone who would even want to try and hurt me. The police told me to keep an eye out and maybe even install a video camera just in case they come back again but this was the scariest I had ever been in my life.

It was the next day when the spam calls wouldn’t stop, I changed my number that day, I would call the prison later to let me brother know of my new number since I didn’t want anymore spam callers calling me. I even decided to maybe even move out of my place just for security since I know they’ll probably come back, the thing I don’t get it is why me tho, why would they want me? I changed number and the spam calls stopped...for now.

A week had passed when it was again at around 11:30 at night when I got a phone call from the same new york number, I grabbed my voice recorder to have as evidence and I answered the call. “What do you want?”

It stayed silent just a bunch of static.

“How did you get this number?”

I was about to hang up when they spoke

“Don’t change your number, they wont like that”

“Who’s this?”

“Just someone who’s trying to help you out, I know they wont stop till they get you”

“Until who gets me?” I asked

“....until they kill you.”

“Why are you doing this to me?”

“I have to show you something” he said.

I received a couple of picture notifications on my phone. I opened them up and what I saw shocked the fuck out of me.

It was pictures of me sleeping in my own bed, in several days of the night, the camera was positioned at the top of the ceiling from the looks of the pictures I looked at the ceiling and saw the ceiling fan had a red bright dot on it, I looked at it closer and I saw a small flash come from it.

“They are watching you, you need to move out of the house, they will kill you. That loan that you tried to sign up for, it was fake, they have your information, and they want to kill you to sell your body parts, that’s how they make their money, now please move out of your home or else”

He hanged up.

I quickly called a friend to see if I can spend the night at their place, my apt was officially off limits for me. I spent the next few days at my friends house until I finally found a new place and managed to move out as soon as possible, I had my friend with me the whole time just in case something were to happen and you can say I am in hiding at the moment since I don’t want to reveal my information, this goes for a warning to everyone out there, be careful about putting your information online, other people might have different and evil motives, I learned this lesson the hard way.

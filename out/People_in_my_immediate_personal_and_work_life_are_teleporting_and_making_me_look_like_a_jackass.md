This isn’t so much no sleep material as it is “question your mind and the way you think reality works” material.

Today was the second time this happened and I don’t think it’s going to be the last. Previously when I moved to a new neighborhood I stepped outside to talk to my dad who was smoking a cigarette (so I thought). I looked to the left and to my surprise he was opening the front door of a neighbors house and walking in! We don’t know them and as far as I know we have had no contact with them.

I needed to ask him something so I started walking towards the house I saw him go into, and once I got to the corner of my house I instinctively looked left. To my surprise, my dad, wearing the same clothes I has just seen him wearing while going into the house down the street, was 50 yards away from me, in the driveway of another house behind our house, walking towards me. Obviously, I questioned him. “How the fuck did you just teleport and why did you do it in front of me?”

He didn’t register any emotion and said “I walk when I smoke”. He was smoking a cigarette so I figured hey, maybe he walked around our house (there’s a big square of road around 4 “lanes” of townhouses in the community we live in.”

“So you didn’t just walk into THAT house, and out of THAT house?”

“Of course not”. He was smiling. It wasn’t a shit eating grin or a fuck you grin, he just thought it was funny I think.

Well, two years later, it happened again, today. I started a new job last week at a fast food style restaurant and while going to see my manager about my schedule for next week, I watched her walk into the freezer. The doors on the freezer don’t lock for safety, and open outward. Thinking about it now, it was stupid for me to follow in, but I wasn’t thinking about not looking like a creep, she told me to clock out at 2, so I did, and I didn’t want to hang around. So I opened the door to the freezer and nobody is in there. I turn around and she says my name as I am halfway turned and she’s coming from the opposite end of the establishment! 

I’m not hallucinating. I don’t believe in that shit. But I’m starting to believe in teleportation and that some of the people in my life know how to use doors and or mirrors to move from in front of me to behind me (kind of like “the adjustment bureau”, which is one of my favorite movies). Since I just got this job I didn’t say a word about what I was thinking to her, cause fuck if I want to get fired for sounding irrational or high or some shit.

But I’m gonna figure out how to prove this before it happens next time, or something, because I do not know if I’m ready to be related to and working for “angels” or whatever rank you have to be to be able to do this.

“Because you’ll *fucking* hurt yourself,” Dad answered through clenched teeth.

At thirteen years old, you can’t yet understand the soft and unspoken boundaries of what it means to go too far.

“Leistung and Zorn *both* hunted with you by the time they were my age-”

“Your brothers met certain standards-”

“That’s not a *good* enough reason to be unfair to me-”

“And you’re not *good* enough to hunt with me!” Dad’s voice came sharp and angry. I could tell that he wanted to take it back as soon as he’d said it.

I waited for him to say that he was sorry, that he loved each of us equally, because in a fair world no father favors one son over another. 

Each second that ticked by rent my adolescent mind a little further. Of *course* Dad had favorites, no matter how much he denied it.

Of *course* I was the least favorite, even if he did love me. 

Of *course* I was the disappointment. 

With the façade finally broken, I suddenly realized that I could access answers that had been denied me. “Fine. I’m not as good as them.” My voice was flat, completely empty of the normal fiery passion dispensed by a teenager denied justice. “Just tell me, Dad. When *can* I start training to hunt with you? When can I tattoo my arm with a symbol of my first kill? I realize it’s going to be later than everyone else, but it has to happen *eventually*, right?”

He was quiet for a long time. 

“You’re talented academically, Mangel,” he responded with a softness that landed much harder than yelling ever could. “Be grateful for that.”

I loved reading but sucked at math, which averaged to a C student on my best day. I knew that my father loved me, but it wasn’t until that moment that I learned what he truly thought of me.

We combat injustices that we believe can be righted, then learn to live with brokenness where healing feels impossible. ‘Growing up’ is how we describe breaking the fragile exterior shell of an imagined world where good and evil are balanced.

I fought with my father less, so he talked to me less. I would still marvel with admiration when he returned with my brothers from a successful hunt. But when the others in our Gathering praised their work, I no longer enjoyed the subsequent swelling of pride that I once did; after all, I had nothing to do with the family’s success.

They were good. That was their business. 

And that’s how I knew that something very bad had happened.

Our basest instincts combine a thousand microstimuli before our rational minds can put reason to feeling. I came home from school that day to feel a draft upon opening the door that told me *something’s wrong at home.*

A wise hunter would know when to turn away and seek backup. But it had long been established that I lacked a hunter’s wisdom and had no one to back me up, so I went foolheartedly into my home. 

More clues popped up immediately. A chair in the dining room lay on its back. Several windows hung lazily open, sending a cross breeze through the entire house. Every Bible in our bookcase had been turned upside down.

I should have turned back.

I didn’t turn back.

Instead, I went to the closet. Dad was unaware that I knew “1913” was the combination to every lock he had. I loved him, but had realized early on that it would be better if he didn’t know when I discovered anything he didn’t choose to tell me.

I tucked something into my waistband before searching the living room and going into each bedroom.

Zorn’s window was broken. Leistung’s sheets were torn.

And there was blood on the floor of my father’s room. Not much, but what quantity of blood on the floor is a safe amount?

My eyes grew heavy and hot as the world sped up and slowed down at the same time. 

Something had gone very, very wrong. 

Hunters risk being hunted every day. We knew this.

It’s why I was growing up with no mother.

I staggered down the stairs.

*The danger had been in my house.*

*It was more than my father and brothers could handle.*

*They know where we live.*

I understood that I had to leave. I wandered, dreamlike, to the front door.

I opened it and found a strange man peering into my home. His skin was ivory white, which contrasted with his jet-black hair and pink eyes.

“Hello, Mangel. I didn’t think we’d have to worry about you.” He stepped inside my house. 

I stepped back, and he closed the door behind us. “You came for my father and brothers when I wasn’t here,” I whispered, trying and failing to hide how much I was shaking. “I’ve read about you in my father’s notebooks. You’re Primul, and he’s been hunting you for years.”

Primul narrowed his eyes at me. “You could have run away before coming inside, and we’d never have chased you,” he responded heavily, continuing to push forward. “You didn’t have to be in this fight. We didn’t need you. But you’ve seen too much now.”

I wanted to say something confident, but my voice cracked in that pre-pubescent way that combines the weakest adult intonation and creepiest childlike sound at the same time.

Then I reached into my waistband and pulled out the long, thin wooden stake that I’d taken from my father’s closet. My hand’s slight tremor caused the tip to shake wildly. 

Primul moved close enough for me to feel his breath licking my face like a cat’s sandpapery tongue. He opened his mouth, and two long, thin fangs grew like icy sabers, extending longer, longer, longer, as he glowered at me with a level of hate that I had not yet grown to understand.

I pointed the stake meekly towards him. 

Primul smacked my hand away with feline speed, knocking the stake out of my hand and sending it flying into the next room. With his other hand, he grabbed my collar and pushed me off my feet. 

Then he flew forward like a bullet, lifting me off the ground and sending us both flying into the corner. I slammed hard against the wall, gasping for the breath that he had knocked out of me. 

Primul grabbed my throat. Long, pointed fingernails pressed into my soft flesh – not quite enough to stop my breathing, but more than sufficient to ensure that I knew he was in his control.

Powerful people are always weak to the threat of feeling that they’re not the one in power.

“It’s too late to walk away, Mangel,” he growled. “So I can do one of three things. I could take you where we’re holding your father and brothers, but I fail to see the value we, or anyone, would find in you as a hostage.” He moved his head closer. “The second is that I could *turn* you. You would not die, but your new life would be in opposition to everything sacred you once believed as a hunter’s son. You would have to turn on all other hunters to survive.” He moved closer still, his voice dropping to an animalistic level. “The third is that I devour you now and put an end to your misery.” His chest was very close to mine. 

I gurgled in response.

“Can’t hear you, boy,” he answered, moving his entire body next to me.

“I said – I could’ve run away,” I mumbled as much as the fingers on my throat would allow. “But I knew you’d come after me, so I scattered these around the house, including the cabinet in this corner.”

He looked down in unadulterated shock at the wooden stake that now extended from my hand and into his bleeding chest. 

I talked more freely as he loosened his grip on my neck. “I knew you’d knock the first stake from my hand. I only showed it so that you’d lower your guard against me.” His hand slipped limply away. “If you’d done your research, you’d know that people underestimate me.”

I stared into his eyes, and nothing looked back.

I relaxed.

Then he lunged. His arms fought against mine, and I knew that I was weak, but now he was weak, too, and I realized faintly that I just *might* hold him off.

Then Primul snapped his teeth – long, angry pincers that chomped and crunched just in front of my face, and I scrambled to free my hands and press against his forehead, and I could feel his tongue lapping against me, and inch, half an inch away, but he was dying and therefore almost equally matched my strength, so I knew it would come down to which of us wanted it more.

And I knew I would win.

I pushed him two, three, four inches away from me, and he gave up. 

The last thing Primul ever saw was the relieved look on the face of a thirteen-year-old boy that he’d doubted.

He fell on the ground, an empty husk. 

I wanted to cry, but didn’t.

“You made a couple of mistakes, Primul,” I heaved, trying desperately to catch my breath. “The first is that you didn’t weigh every detail before attacking this family. We’re taught that as little kids. You’d make a shitty Hunter.” My breath was slowly coming back under control. “The second is that you told me my family isn’t dead.” I plucked the bloody stake from his chest. “Which means this is just getting started.”

I headed to my father’s now unlocked closet for supplies.

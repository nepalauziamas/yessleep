&#x200B;

I remember shaking and feeling as if my world was crashing down around me.

Uphir’s moment of triumph was interrupted by Sisoe, “Charity was misled!” She called out.

Uphir leaned away from me, returning to his lectern, “Misled? She seemed *more* than capable and culpable. I saw little to no misleading parties,” Uphir stated matter-of-factly.

“You know very well she was!” Sisoe snapped, “Charity would *never* condone anything like this on her own!”

Uphir laughed, “Oh? She was *more* than willing to offer her son up as the tool in her little scheme!”

“It wasn’t *her* scheme, and you know it!” Sisoe snapped.

Uriel’s voice boomed, “**Silence!”**

Uphir and Sisoe turned to Uriel, with Sisoe jumping slightly from Uriel’s mighty voice.

“Evidence,” Uriel demanded, turning to Sisoe, “Such an accusation requires evidence.”

Sisoe steadied herself and cleared her throat, “I call forth, to our presence, the one who goes by the mortal name of Sal Lous.”

Uriel turned to Uphir, “Well? Where is he?”

Uphir smiled, “To call forth a Duke of Hell, even to this realm, from another, would take a fair bit of prodding. But in this case, I believe he would make an exception. Though, I doubt he’d do so for long.”

“A Duke of Hell?” I asked, confused, “Sal isn’t a duke. He’s a preacher.”

Sisoe nodded, “See? She was deceived!”

“Humans know the devil comes in many forms. Their judgment to follow those who claim to be one thing and remain another is their responsibility to bear,” Uriel lamented, “However, if you’re stating that somehow Charity Higgins’ free will was subverted or greatly influenced by demonic magics or misdeed, then that changes the narrative,” his maw turned up into a delighted grin, “Oh, but this is the *most* interesting judgment I’ve presided over in millennia! I do hope this isn't the last of this sort.”

Uphir nodded and moved to the center of the room. He drew a circle on the floor and within it, I watched him begin to spell out letters: S A L E O S.

After a moment, the figure of a man appeared as if a silhouette of someone.

“Uphir, by what terrible prank is it you call forth my attention from my detailed work in the Mortal realms?” A voice that was similar to Sal’s bellowed. Almost like an older version of him.

“Accusation was made that, perhaps, my liege, you were involved in leading this young lady astray,” Uphir said with a grin.

The figure turned to me and I saw a wide smile before the familiar face of Sal appeared, his stature shrinking slightly as he turned to me, “Oh, *Charity*!” He shouted, “How we have missed you, dear, such a shame what happened! I haven’t even heard the tragic news of your demise yet.”

“Y-You haven’t?” I gasped, wondering why Sal was here or how.

“Oh, my sweet little thing,” Sal clasped his hands together, looking at me, “We heard about the accident but, tsk tsk,” he chuckled, “I guess you didn’t pull through, despite our *prayer circles*,” his grin grew vicious now, “as if such efforts weren't wasted entirely on *you* mortal filth.”

I swallowed hard, confusion turning to fear as he spoke more crassly to me.

“You outdid my wildest expectations, I must say. I knew you were passionate, but,” Sal wagged his finger at me, “Shame, shame, little one! Such a naughty little girl to cause such heartache.”

Sisoe glared at Sal, “Duke Saleos admitted to it! He manipulated her and led her astray!” Sisoe accused.

Sal narrowed his eyes on Sisoe and those eyes turned black as a smoke-like beard surrounded Sal’s face. He grew another three feet as gleaming armor adorned his body. A massive red cape unfurled behind him and a helm formed on his head. The helm looked as if it were shaped like an alligator or something as he stepped towards us, one foot remaining in the circle. From this angle, I saw a pair of massive feathered wings, jet black, covered in some rusted chain mail.

“Manipulate? I only guided Charity to her own truth!” Sal bellowed.

“W-What are you?!” I shouted, horrified by the sudden change in Sal’s appearance.

Sal’s black eyes focused on me, “**I am Duke Saleos, Nineteenth Spirit of the Seventy Two enslaved by the King of Fools, Solomon, Herald of Creation and commander of thirty legions of the infernal armies**.”

I swallowed hard, “Y-You were our ‘Army of God’ leader. Y-You talked about how children being born was a sacred act of God.”

Sal grinned wickedly, “Yes… Because the more of you pathetic creatures that spew forth, the more strife is inflicted upon the world. The more your resources and infrastructure of society begin to crumble beneath the weight of your increased populace. With every new iteration of you little monkeys, the world Our Father made dies, just a little more,” he laughed, “So, of course, I would promote there to be more and more of you. *Especially* into the arms of those who do not wish, or lack the means, to properly care for them!”

Uriel’s voice boomed, “**Silence or I’ll cast you down into Hellfire here and now, Fallen one.”**

Sal’s smile faded as he turned to Uriel, glancing at Uphir, “Why have you called me before an Archangel, *fool*?” Sal spat at Uphir.

“I do so in the process of judging Charity Higgins’s soul,” Uphir explained, “Sisoe claimed you manipulated her.”

Sal laughed, “Manipulated her?” he grinned, “I merely offered her access to a group of like-minded individuals,” he placed his hand on his chest, “In fact, I shielded her from the earthly consequences of her and her son's misdeeds.”

“Of course you did,” Sisoe hissed.

“Did I not do her a favor? Protecting her?” Sal grinned, “We were friends, were we not, Charity?”

“I-I would never have joined your false ‘Army of God’ if I knew what you were!” I shouted.

“I merely introduced you, my dear,” Sal chortled, “The targets are chosen by the organization, the doctor's name? That all came from the group.  I merely brought you all together and shielded you from consequence in the mortal world. Your actions were yours! It is astonishing what mortals will do when they feel they will suffer no repercussions,” Sal’s grin grew wicked as he motioned to Uriel, “Though I cannot protect you from *all* the consequences of your actions. Unless, of course, you wish to make a more substantial deal with me now?”

“Never!” I cried out.

“For *once*, a wise and righteous decision,” Sal chuckled, “That cannot be said for the wicked actions of your son, of course.”

Sisoe’s face went pale, “Saleos has given his testimony. He may leave now-”

Uphir quickly held his hand up, “I object to Saleos’s dismissal! It is clear Saleos is aware of more sin weighing on Charity Higgins' soul.”

Uriel knocked his mighty claw on the stone table, “Speak of this sin, Duke of Hell, then you may leave. The less time I spend looking over you, the better.”

“As when you cast me into the fire all those eons ago?” Saleos said with a stern gaze.

Uriel pointed a clawed finger at Saleos, “It is only by my grace and patience I do not do so now and rip you from your mortal shell. You are here to provide context upon Charity Higgins' actions and nothing more.”

“Of course,” Saleos bowed and spoke to Uriel, “If anyone is guilty of manipulation, it is Charity Higgins. For when Charity Higgins set her son Jeremy Higgins to the task of tormenting that young girl and even helped to shield his friends who were all just as guilty, setting a mob upon her.”

“I-” before I could speak, Sisoe was quick to interrupt me.

“She did no more than *you* did to her. That’s not misleading!” Sisoe argued.

Saleos turned to Uphir, “Enjoy her soul. She’s a sweet thing,” before he turned to Sisoe, “Unlike Charity Higgins, Jeremey Higgins is her son. What is it you angels demanded of mortals? Ah! *Respect Thine Father and Thy Mother*, yes?” Saleos said with a mocking laugh.

With a whirlwind of red fire wrapping around him, Saleos vanished.

There was silence for a moment as I felt my heart sink to the ground.

Sisoe piped up, “Charity cannot be held directly responsible for her son's actions.”

“I beg to differ, as Duke Saleos pointed out: A child must respect thine father and mother, yes?” Uphir asked.

Uriel knocked his claw on the stone table once more, “A nuance at best,” he grinned, “This is a most interesting case.”

“It does stand to reason that we ought to see to what level Charity has encouraged her son and what her encouragement led to, yes?” Uphir asked.

“Charity didn’t know the details of what happened,” Sisoe defended, “She defended her child blindly, as any mother should!”

“Turning a blind eye to sin does not make it less of a sin,” Uphir asked, “Shall we delve into this matter further?”

“Again, Charity did not witness nor know what her son did, so I see no point,” Sisoe countered.

Uriel stood, “Then, we shall see what it was her son did at Charity Higgins' direction. I shall call upon the Choir of Watchers and seek out an angel who has seen the actions of Jeremy Higgins. We will take a brief recess,” Uriel turned to Sisoe, “I suggest you take this time to prepare your charge, Sisoe.”

I felt like I was being lifted into the air before I was in the strange white void again.

Sisoe was pacing back and forth.

I swallowed hard, “S-Sisoe?”

“Yes, yes, I…” Sisoe turned to me, “Oh, prepping you. Right. I’m so sorry. Okay…” she knelt before me and smiled, “We’re okay so far. Everyone sins and makes mistakes. We must compare your sin to your good works and prove that sin is outweighed.”

“O-okay,” I stammered, still nervous.

“Uriel is seeking a watcher who will summon your son’s memories. Sin is often tempered by honesty, so is there anything you think you can confess to regarding your son?” Sisoe asked.

I heaved a sigh, “The party. The party where I made sure all the boy’s stories matched up,” I pursed my lips, “I didn’t care if they were lying. I just wanted to make sure they all had the same story.”

“Do you know what they did?” Sisoe asked.

“I don’t know exactly. I figured they cornered her and pushed her around a little bit, scaring her, you know?” I frowned, “I just wanted that abortion doctor to leave town or close up shop.”

“Okay, that’s good. Your intentions are clear. We need to present that to give context to your son's actions,” Sisoe stood up, looking around, “Sisynios, Synidores? Are you there? I could use a little advice.”

Sisynios appeared first, looking up to Sisoe, “Oh, we’re dropping the mortal friendly forms? Lovely!” Sisynios stretched and I watched as they turned into a male negative of Sisoe. A muscular form with razor-sharp claws and a hawk-like beak, but their scales were white with flecks of gold and their horns and claws were golden like Sisoe.

I swallowed hard, “H-Hi.”

Sisynios sighed, “Synidores, you coming out?” He leaned down to whisper to me, “Synidores is a little off-put by your comments before. An apology should be in order.”

I nodded, looking around curiously before a bright flash filled my vision.

A mighty crystal-like being appeared before me, with a ring of rotating eyes circling its entire form. Six rigid crystal wings spread from behind it as it floated near me. A head sat on the body, eyeless and nooseless, with only a mouth on its otherwise smooth and pearl-like face. It appeared as if it were a moving quartz statue.

“Charity,” the voice of Synidores echoed from its mouth, “It is I, Synidores, *be not afraid*.”

I was stunned by their appearance and knelt, “H-Hello, Saint Synidores. I’m sorry if my comments offended you.”

“Stand, I am no deity,” Synidores explained, “I should apologize for being so easily offended. I dislike being pressed into mortal definitions of gender and biology.”

I gave a nod, “I’m… Well, I’m learning a lot today.”

Synidores form appeared to turn to Sisoe, “Are you having difficulty?”

“Uriel assigned Uphir as a persecutor and he called upon Saleos, who proved he didn’t directly influence Charity’s actions… Now they’re talking about bringing up her son’s actions, as they believe Charity influenced his behavior,” Sisoe confessed.

Sisynios asked me, “Did you influence his behavior, Charity?”

I looked to my feet and nodded, “Yes. I included him in my little scheme, but it was to defend the unborn.”

I heard a sound, not unlike a wind chime, as Synidores sighed, “If the actions are minor, then that should be enough. What was it your son did?”

“He bullied the daughter of a baby-killing doctor,” I confessed.

Sisynios placed his hand to his chin, “Well, that is cruel, but nothing terribly sinful.”

“To the point where she committed suicide?” I had to emphasize.

Sisynios hemmed and hawed, “The girl’s choice to take her life is unfortunate and while your son may have started the bullying, it’s hard to place her death on either of your shoulders specifically.”

I sighed in relief.

“Suicide? Over bullying?” Synidores questioned, “That *is* unusual.”

“I thought so as well,” I pointed out, “I tried to tell Jeremy it wasn’t his fault, but he took her death very personally.”

“I’d expect him too. He’s only a young man,” Sisoe explained.

A bell rang and Sisoe turned to the other two angels.

“Good luck, sister,” Sisynios said with a smile, “You’ll do well, no matter what.”

“An added point of relief,” Synidores advised as they faced me, “You are dead as of now, but doctors are working on you as we speak: They may yet revive you.”

“You mean… I might survive?!” I gasped.

Synidores’s form seemed to nod, “Yes. But be warned: Should you be judged, your judgment will stand should you not change your ways. Upon your true and final death, you will forego further judgment.”

“What does that mean?” I asked.

Sisoe and Sisynios both turned to Synidores, listening.

“It means that you must focus on this judgment and take heed: Even if you live, your judgment will be final unless you drastically change your ways. I hope you understand: Only in life can you be forgiven for your actions and your forgiveness must be more than words, understand?” Synidores explained.

I smiled, “Thank you… Thank you, yes. I will listen!” I beamed to the angelic creature, “I… I hope you’re right and I live. I’ll make sure to take heed. You’re an excellent guardian Angel, Synidores. Thank you,” I gushed.

Synidores’s form brightened, “It is my task. Now, Sisoe and you must return before Uriel.”

Sisoe smiled at me, “Ready?”

“As ready as I am going to be,” I said as I felt the sensation of falling again.

I was again in the strange twilight realm, with an additional angel alongside Uriel.

Uphir appeared impatient, “I do have other places to be, you know.”

“Time matters not here, you know this,” Uriel growled, “As I stated, I have found the watcher angel who shall give us the vision of your son’s actions, performed at your direction.”

The angel standing near Uriel was what I would imagine an ordinary angel would be. He was mostly human, with large white wings behind his back. He wore a blindfold and was dressed in red and silver robes. His brown hair was short and a bronze headband wrapped around his hairline. Though he appeared tall, around six foot five, he was dwarfed by Uriel’s size.

“State your name and purpose,” Uriel ordered.

“I am an Angel of the Choir of Watchers, known as Bartleby. I am honored to be chosen by you, Archangel Uriel,” the angel Bartleby announced.

Uphir approached Bartleby, looming over him as well, “We wish to see the actions of Jeremy Higgins, son of Charity Higgins, after she told him to torment a little girl.”

Sisoe growled, “I object to Uphir phrasing the event as such! Charity wished to have her son help her in stopping an abortionist.”

“I care not either way,” Uriel explained, “Watcher Bartleby, please show us.”

“As you wish, Archangel Uriel,” Bartleby said as he removed his blindfold. His eyes were stunning! Two beautiful orbs of solid gold sat in his head as he looked to the floor before us.

Out of nowhere, I saw a scene, as if looking down from above, of a locker room.

The young girl I had called "The Target" was tossed in, followed by six boys. The boys had already ripped her shirt up.

"Please, leave me alone!” The young girl shrieked.

I saw Jeremy and his friends walk in, “I dunno, your dad kills babies, so what makes you so special? Are you even his?”

Someone else shouted, “Maybe he stole her from someone’s vag!”

“Stop it!” She wailed, tears in her eyes.

“Hey, her dad does abortions. I got an idea!” One boy moved to the girl and grabbed her, another doing the same, “Jeremy! Come on, help us out!”

Jeremy looked confused but moved toward the girl, “Help with what?”

“Pants, her!” The boys shouted.

I frowned and my brow furrowed as I watched on. The event was much crueler than I thought.

Jeremey turned around, but his other friends had boxed him in. Without any escape, Jeremy grabbed at her pants and tugged them down. As he did so, he pulled her panties down as well.

The boys all erupted in laughter, mocking the young girl in multiple ways before someone pulled down Jeremy’s pants from behind!

“Come on, Jeremey, her dad will take care of the kid if you knock her up! Do it!” The boy holding her shouted.

My eyes went wide, tears filling them, as the ‘Do it’ chants grew louder and louder among the boys.

Jeremy’s face was beet red and he looked around, frightened and confused.

The chants began to shift quickly as Jeremy showed hesitation, “Pussy! Pussy! Jeremy’s a Pussy!”

Someone pushed Jeremy forward, “Do it pussy! What are you, gay?!”

Jeremy looked panicked, but to my horror, he grabbed the girl and I had to turn away as I heard her screams.

Sisoe called out, “That’s enough!”

The vision stopped.

Bartleby pulled his blindfold on and turned to me, “I’m so sorry.”

I was stunned into silence.

Uphir walked to Uriel, “Clearly, this one is destined for my domain.”

Uriel turned to Sisoe, “What say you to the persecutor, Uphir?”

Sisoe took a deep breath, “Charity had no idea what had happened, nor that it had been so severe.”

“Yet…” Uphir said, picking up my book, “She was happy to turn a blind eye to it.”

I watched as Uphir placed his hand on the book and I remembered what Sisoe had said.

“Yes! It’s true!” I shouted, “I invited all of those boys to my house under the ruse of it being a birthday party! I-I helped them make a clever story,” I stammered, “And when Jeremy came to me later I…” I recalled how distraught Jeremy was that day, “I brushed his concerns aside.  I didn’t listen to him. I should have…"

Uphir’s hand moved from the book.

“I just wanted to save the souls of the unborn children!” I blurted out, tears flooding from my eyes, “Surely my intention was pure, at least?!” I whimpered.

Uphir’s grin grew vicious once more.

“Save souls?” Uriel’s voice boomed, “**Do you truly think a soul, something so potent, so everlasting and immortal, would be wasted on a pregnancy where the child has not yet even drawn their first breath**?”

I turned to Uriel, shocked, “W-What?”

“Are mortals so ignorant these days to ignore even their own laws?” Uriel growled, “Your faith clearly describes the act of life in your books, ‘*He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and it was then that the man became a living being.’”*

I was dumbfounded, “W-What do you mean, my laws? Those are God’s laws, aren’t they?”

Uriel rolled his burning ember-like eyes, “Hell would overflow would the Almighty, Blessed be He, accept but *one* faith. He has written: *Truly I tell you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven,”* Uriel rose from his seat, “Meaning that whatever your faith’s law, that faith you shall be judged upon, either the just deeds or the sins therein.”

I felt my stomach sink once more as Uriel loomed over me.

“But back to your foolish outlook,” Uriel said, “A soul is our most potent possession. To create it costs a great deal of energy and as such, it is not wasted on the unborn. Not until they take a breath and a soul enters at that moment, as Our Father, Blessed Be, breathed the breath of life into the first man, so He does so to all.”

I was shaking now.

“That being said: Most of our faith does not approve of the willful and wanton destruction of potential vessels, but should such a thing happen, a soul merely moves to the next available vessel,” Uriel shook his head, “But even with that disapproval, it is not worth the torment of a living soul.”

“W-Wait, Archangel!” Sisoe called out.

Uriel spread his wings, “As such, I have made my judgment upon you, Charity Higgins!”

Tears filled my eyes.

“**Your heart is not pure enough to pass unto God’s light, as such, and as is with your faith, you shall be cast into Hellfire for your sins of leading your son astray and ignoring his plea to confide in you, his mother,**” Uriel spoke, his voice rising.

“W-Wait! I was faithful! I went to church! I-” I was cut off as I felt the ground vanish beneath me, and to my abject horror, I began to fall.

As I fell, I heard Uriel’s booming voice echo, **“**[**For these sins, Charity Higgins, your soul shall burn**](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Guardian_Temple)**.”**

Growing up, I really hated frogs. And I mean I seriously despised the slimy little bastards. You would too, if everybody said you looked like one...

At school, the cruel jokes never stopped. Kids would follow me around going 'ribbit' and worm the word ‘croak’ into every other sentence. Then one morning, as I shoulder charged my way along a busy corridor, an older boy took one look at me and said, “Hey Kermit.”

Even the principal laughed. And so, from that day forth, I was known only as…Kermit.

Now what made these frog-related taunts *especially* ironic was the fact my mom looked like a fairy-tale princess. She had long dark hair that draped past her shoulders and striking green eyes. Anytime she came within a half-mile of the school, my classmates would all say, “Your mom's a total babe, Kermit.”

Thinking about her now, some two decades later, still gets me choked up. Unfortunately, my daughter’s reached the age where she’s become a mini-KGB officer. Her nonstop questions are (mostly) a rapid-fire barrage of harmless nonsense—*Have you ever ridden a hot air balloon Daddy? What’s your favorite color hamster?*—but every so often, she’ll ask an especially tricky one. Like *what’s wrong with your hands?* Or, *how come I’ve only got two grandparents?*

For years I’ve danced around the story of how my family fell apart, but now seems as good a time as any to dredge up some bad memories.

See, when I was a boy, my mom took me on these treasure hunts. We’d traipse up and down the beach behind our cottage, through stinking seaweed and crab shells. And all the while, she’d hum this soft little tune. *Dee...deedee…dundadee.*

When I asked Mom what she hoped to find out there, she’d say she couldn’t really remember, only that it was big and grey.

“But lots of things are big and grey,” I said. “How would we know we’ve found the right one?”

She closed her eyes, her expression all wistful. “Because it’ll feel wet and slimy.”

And so, without actually knowing what to search for, we rummaged through broken bottles, kelp, rusted coke cans, and whatever else washed up onshore.

Dad never joined these hunts. He spent his days out on boats and his nights drinking in a little pub called the Harbour Inn, where he'd show off pictures of Mom and say, 'quite a catch, huh?'. Most nights he'd stagger home, completely pissed, sometime after 2 AM, stinking of both fish guts and whiskey.

Every so often he'd insist Mom go find a job to help earn some money, even though things never ended well. Because of her terrible memory, Mom either forgot to turn off an oven or return from her lunch break on time. She couldn’t stomach criticism, either. Sooner or later, a co-worker would remark about how she styled her hair or wore her makeup, then she’d quit on the spot.

Given her bull-headedness and the general effect she had on men, I never understood why she stayed with Dad. There was plenty of fish in the sea, after all. And he treated her like something stuck to the bottom of his boot. She wasn’t exactly short of suitors, either—during our treasure hunts, countless guys invented flimsy excuses to chat her up.

On Saturdays, my old man made me join him on fishing expeditions so he could teach me how to properly navigate waves. The two of us went out on this little rowboat with our fishing poles, and anytime I made a catch he'd thump my back hard and say, “You’re a chip off the old block.”

Although only in his thirties, a hard upbringing meant Dad looked much, much older. He also stood taller and broader than any other person in our sleepy village.

A few miles off the coast, there was this tiny island, and every time we rowed past, Dad would point to this crude pile of rocks in the centre and say, “I built that memorial for your grandfather."

Then he'd inevitably recount the story of how one day, while out fishing, a storm erupted out of nowhere, tossing him, his father, and their crewmates around until an especially violent wave made the ship's trawler snap. It whipped right around and took Grandpa's left leg clean off.

"We made for that island and tried to clamp his wound," Dad would say, fighting back emotion, "but it was already too late.”

My old man insisted I’d become a great fisherman someday. But secretly, I hated fishing, almost as much as frogs. I hated the awkward motion of the boat. I hated the salty sea air. I hated that chafing wind that turned your cheeks red. And above all, I hated the noisy gulls, who always sounded like they were laughing. Those cackles reminded me of the kids at school.

One evening, at the dinner table, I worked up the nerve to say all this.

“What are you talking about?” Dad slammed his fist against the table hard enough to make the plates rattle and bounce.

“Well…fishing’s boring and it makes your clothes all stinky.”

Mom shot me a look, silently advising I drop the subject. It was too late for that, though. “And you’re away all the time,” I said to Dad. “If it wasn’t for our lessons, I don’t think I’d remember what you look like.”

Without warning, he reached over and gave my wrist a sudden tug. I got pinned against the table, the whole right side of my face buried in a mountain of mashed potatoes.

While I pleaded for help and struggled to break free, Mom jumped up and furiously pried Dad off my arm. “Enough,” she shouted. “He doesn’t know what he’s saying.”

As suddenly as Dad’s rage appeared, it evaporated. He released my arm and said, “We’ll talk about this later.”

Then he grabbed his coat and stormed off, presumably to the Harbour Inn.

Warm gravy ran down my chin and dripped onto the floor.

Alone with Mom, I said, “Sorry I made him mad Mommy.”

She gestured for me to sit on her lap, cradled me into her chest like a teddy bear, and then picked lumps of potato out of my hair. “That’s okay, darling. It’s not your fault.”

Sometimes after midnight, a fierce argument erupted downstairs. I tiptoed to the top of the staircase to listen in. After a few minutes of stomping around the ground floor, my father's voice grew louder and angrier until there was a sudden thump. Everything went quiet after that.

The next morning, Mom had an ugly purple bruise beneath her left eye.

That summer, the two of us went treasure hunting almost every day. The second my eyes opened I'd rush into her room to remind her it was time to go, otherwise, it would completely slip her mind.

Around July time she began to suspect her lost thing wasn’t actually on the beach, so we searched the village and surrounding hills, constantly on the lookout for something big and grey.

“Why would what you lost be all the way out here?” I asked one afternoon, as we picnicked on a grassy knoll overlooking the coast. “When I lose my marbles, they’re always close by, like in my sock or under my bed.” I bit into my fruit scone while Mom nibbled on her tuna sandwich.

“Because your fathers a *very* sneaky man,” she replied, matter-of-factly.

When I screwed up my face, she sighed and said, “You see darling, I always thought I’d lost my precious thing. Eleven years ago I met your father, and we had a lot of fun together. It was never meant to be long-term, and I certainly didn’t like the idea of cooking and cleaning for anyone, but one day I woke up and my precious thing was gone. Without it, I couldn’t leave. So I stuck around, expecting it'd turn up sooner or later, then before I knew it you came along.” She gave my cheek a quick peck. “But that night you made him angry, he came home drunk, and we got into a huge row. Well, one thing led to another and he let slip that he’s stolen what I thought I’d lost. After all these years, to discover what he’d done, I slapped him so hard it left a mark, then he grabbed me by the neck and threw me against the wall. The next morning, his hangover was so bad he forgot about what happened.”

Unsure how else how to respond, I simply said, “I’m sorry Mommy.”

“That’s okay darling. But unless I find what I lost, my memory’s only going to get worse.”

“Then we better find it fast.”

That made her smile. The two of us off after gathering our things, her humming that soft tune. *Dee...deedee…dundadee.*

She made me promise not to repeat any of this to Dad, but at that age, what kids any good at keeping secrets? The next time he took me fishing, he picked up on my quiet demeanor. “What’s the matter with you?”

“Nothing,” I replied, keeping my eyes glued to the waves.

The moment one of his giant hands clamped over my shoulder, a confession practically spewed out. My heart thudded wildly against my chest as it did. Dad may have been an expert fisherman, but he lacked the temperament for fatherhood, and Mom wasn’t around to cool his temper.

At that moment, it occurred to me she maybe only stayed with Dad so I wouldn’t have to fend for myself…

The wind died and the waves calmed while both of us sat in utter silence.

Eventually, he said, “You did the right thing by telling me.”

Already there were tears in my eyes, no doubt because of my own sense of shame. I wiped them away and said, “Maybe if you gave back what you stole, Mommy would be so grateful she’d forgive you, and then she’d stop forgetting things?”

“This *thing* your moms looking for. If she found it, she’d disappear forever. And you’d never, *ever* see her again.” There was a stern warning in his voice.

“No.”

“She’d disappear, son. You don’t want that to happen do you?”

Saying nothing, I bit my bottom lip and shook my head.

“Good.” He stared off into the horizon. “In any case, you needn’t worry. That stupid woman could pull the village apart brick by brick and never find what she’s looking for.”

On our next treasure hunt, I kept my lip buttoned about what Dad said. Me and Mom were having so much fun together—the thought of her leaving made me nauseous, and the idea of living with Pops, no mediator around to cool his temper, absolutely terrified me.

In the summer of ’99, as Mom and I strolled out of the theatre after watching Star Wars, she forgot the entire movie before we’d even crossed the lobby. Her memory had never been *that* bad before.

It was only the beginning. Over the next few weeks, she’d nip out to buy groceries and get lost on the way home, or need to spend a full minute concentrating extra hard just to remember my name. Since Dad had me to keep her out of trouble he stayed largely ignorant of all this, although the way she constantly trailed off mid-sentence quickly wore down his patience. Glass bottles started flying in my direction anytime she lost her train of thought.

One afternoon, as Mom sat on a stool in our back garden and stared at the ocean waves, I clasped her hand and said, “Is everything okay, Mommy?”

She reared up in her seat, her face terribly pale. “Oh, it’s you. Yes, sweetheart…I think so.” She let out a deep sigh, that flicker of recognition already fading.

At that moment it became painfully clear we couldn’t carry on like this. If we did, Mom would wither away. There was no choice other than to help her, whatever the consequences.

I pulled her to her feet. “C’mon, let’s go.”

“Where to?” she asked, letting me lead her around like an eager puppy.

“On a treasure hunt.”

I pushed my old man’s rowboat into the ocean, letting it bob on the back of a few limp waves until we were deep enough to start paddling. For once, I found myself grateful Dad made me take all those dumb lessons.

At Grandpa’s Island, I jumped into the waist-deep water—my toes going numb in an instant—and marooned the boat on a beach of pebbles. I’d secretly known Dad’s hiding spot for a while.

The island was really just a big rock, and in the center lay Grandpa’s memorial; a crude pyramid of smaller rocks. My fleece became a damp rag against my back as I pulled the structure apart, piece by piece. Nearby, Mom sat in a dream-like state.

After lifting away an especially slippery, moss-covered stone, I saw something poking out from underneath: a burlap sack, so badly rotted there was a hole in the side. The beginnings of a grey object poked through.

“Mom, I think I found it,” I shouted, practically jumping up and down. The thing inside the sack had the consistency of pickled eggs and carried a damp, fungal scent.

“Mom?” I held her shoulders so she had to face me.

Her eyes stared off over my shoulder, toward the yellow and orange horizon. I cupped my eyes, squinted into the distance, and saw there was a boat sailing straight toward us.

It was Dad. He'd likely arrived home, discovered his rowboat missing, and put two and two together. I had to act fast...

Pulling down the rest of the structure was bitter work; soon there were blood blisters all over my hands.

After tossing aside the final rock, I hoisted the sack onto my shoulder with a loud grunt and said, “Mom, I found it. Look.”

She sat motionless, as though hypnotized by a stage magician. I had no idea what her lost thing was or how it might help, plus now Dad was less than a few minutes away. When he got his hands on me, he’d be furious—so furious he might have to build *another* memorial.

We had to set sail. Hopefully, Mom would become lucid again before Dad caught up.

I guided her into the boat and lay the sack across her lap, but before we could even cast off, Dad marooned *his* boat, jumped into the water, and grabbed our stern, holding us in place.

“Give that to me,” he demanded.

“No,” I said, angrily. “Mom’s sick. She’s sick, and this’ll help her feel better.”

“It won’t make her better it’ll make her leave. Is that what you want?”

“Better she leaves than stays like this.”

He clenched his jaw and stuck me in the left temple, which knocked me onto the wooden boards. I rolled from side to side, clutching my burning eye socket. At that moment, Dad was prepared to kill me. Better his family passed away in a freak boating accident than abandon him for being an asshole, right?

The violent action snapped Mom out of her daze. She fumbled for words. “Who said that? What happened? Where—”

As her eyes flicked between me, Dad, and the thing on her lap, the realization hit her like a lightning bolt.

Dad tried to snatch her object away, but Mom held on tight and went along with it. The rotted sack practically disintegrated as the two of them wrestled around, then the thing inside fell out and slumped over the bow. Whatever it was kinda looked like a wetsuit.

Dad seized Mom's wrists before she could scoop it up. Still feeling every heartbeat along the left side of my face, I fumbled around, grabbed a paddle, bounced up, and then brought the end down across the back of Dad's head. His upper torso sprawled forward, into the boat.

Rubbing the swollen goose egg already forming around the back of his skull, he straightened up, pupils badly dilated. Before he could lunge at Mom a second time, I threw myself between them and held out the paddle like a shield while she fumbled around.

With barely any effort Dad wrestled away my oar, the boat tipping wildly to the port side. Saltwater splashed over all three of us as he repeatedly struck me in the face, and then stars danced in front of my eyes.

I vaguely remember lying flat on my back, a river of blood spewing from my nostrils, and watching a hazy, upside-down Mom slide the wetsuit-thing up her legs and torso. It made a noise like dog food escaping from a tin.

Dad made one final, desperate attempt to stop her by leaping forward, arms outstretched. The sudden shift in weight rocked the boat, almost to the point of tipping to the starboard side, but then both my parents plummeted overboard. The vessel quickly rebalanced, taking on a little water.

A column of white foam hissed into the air. It was followed by a sharp yelp. Then, gurgles.

I rolled onto my stomach and peeked over the side, just in time to watch a stream of bubbles disappear.

Quickly the water turned light pink. Then a grey skull, capped by a single dorsal fin, appeared beneath the surface. As two webbed hands reached out of the water and wrapped around the side of the boat, I scrambled away, fumbling wildly for a paddle or a rock, for anything to defend myself with.

Directly in front of me, a sea creature hoisted itself into view. The humanoid beast had fish-like scales, seaweed-coloured hair straggling from the top of a wet skull, and deep, green eyes.

The creature's mouth widened, revealing countless rows of serrated teeth. It slowly raised a webbed hand, identical to mine in all ways except color. And then it made a series of liquid gurgles. Those sounds followed a simple pattern: *Dee...deedee…dundadee.*

I studied my hands. My stupid, ugly, webbed hands; the same ones that earned me the nickname 'Kermit'.

And as I gazed into the creature’s eyes—those familiar green eyes—it became clear *who* exactly I was gazing at.

“Mom?”

In the years since that fateful day, I’ve learned all about selkies, a sea folk capable of shedding their skin to transform into beautiful women. Pop down to the local library, and you'll find countless fairytales about cruel men stealing selkies' skin to coerce them to stay on land and have children, ones who can be identified by their webbed hands.

But selkies aren’t meant to live on land. Not permanently, at least. They either return to the sea or slowly wither away, like my mother.

There is, however, one part the old stories always get wrong. They say once selkies return to the ocean, their families never see them again. Today marks the twenty-third anniversary of my mom recovering her skin, and every year, at Grandpa’s Island, she emerges from the ocean, transforms back into a human, and we have ourselves a family reunion.

I told everyone my parents drowned that day. But this year, my daughter’s finally old enough to know the truth bout my mom. About the selkies.

This year, she finally gets to meet her grandmother.

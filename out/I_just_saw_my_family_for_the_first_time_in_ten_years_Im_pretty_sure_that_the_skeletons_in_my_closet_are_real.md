 My lung has collapsed from getting stabbed between the ribs, I once threw a man into traffic so that he wouldn’t shoot me in the dick, I’ve been passed around a prison room shower, and might have forgotten the worst of it because I was so fucking high at my life’s most critical decisions. But the scariest moment I’ve ever endured was just after stabbing my cousin for trying to kill our decrepit grandfather, as a deep-voiced little girl crawled across the ceiling to inform me that I was needed for something very special. [I’d never experienced fear like that before, because I had no idea how I was going to replace my shattered meth pipe](https://redd.it/utsn26).

“Never in your entire life, not once, have you ever been useful,” Grandpa Delora hissed before slurping up a layer of drool. “Not until just now.” He turned to look at Cousin Chet’s cooling body. “You may prove useful yet, Charles. This endeavor could prove fatal, but what do we have to lose by risking you?”

I scratched the scab on my arm until blood flowed from it. I loved feeling the pain. It grounded me, and the scratching gave me something to do, because I couldn’t stop moving.

Chet’s body seemed out of place in Grandpa Delora’s elegant library. It smelled of old books and blood. I closed my eyes and rocked, back and forth, back and forth. When I opened them, the little girl’s upside down face was four inches from my own.

I knew it wasn’t a child looking back at me. When you stare at someone long enough, you *see* them. 

That’s when I noticed her feet were still attached to the ceiling; her body had stretched like taffy, nineteen feet long and thirteen inches thin. 

“Who are you?” I whispered as she retracted to her normal height, hanging upside down from the rafters like a bat.

The thing inside the little girl’s body licked its lips.

“Redemption,” Grandpa grumbled.

I stared up from my position on the floor. Veiny legs descended into gnarled feet that had been kept alive far longer than any natural intention should have allowed. I looked into his broken, yellow teeth, and up at his broken, yellow face. “The damned can’t save the damned.”

*crunch*

The little girl fell from the ceiling and crashed into the floor by my head. I only had time to flinch before she touched my neck.

It was ice cold, *colder* than ice, and every part of me felt the unnatural connection. Its face was that much worse for ostensibly belonging to a child; the eyes, all pupils with no trace of white, knew that I hurt, and that’s what made it happy.

“You never knew what it was to be a man, Charles, but Mammon can make you more than that,” Grandpa gurgled before snorting back a wad of phlegm. “*Let him in.*”

I dry heaved, turning away from the girl and trying to focus on the wooden inlays of the ceiling. “I’m not letting that thing inside of me,” I whispered.

Grandpa snorted. “Charles, have you *ever* turned down the opportunity to inject something foul into your body?”

I wiped away a tear and crawled to my hands and knees, staring out the window into the cobalt sky. I could almost see the Pacific. I tried to focus on that.

*crack*

Grandpa was weak, but it didn’t take much force to elicit a concussion with a wooden cane. I collapsed in a world of hot, loud pain. 

But I didn’t retaliate. I couldn’t imagine doing anything like it, so the task was impossible. 

When Grandpa spoke next, his spittle cooled my neck. “Let him in, Charles, and you *get* to lose everything.”

I broke. I didn’t cry, because tears manifest a loss of hope. I was simply empty, and had no way to get high within the next twenty minutes. “Okay,” I answered in a hollow breath, “how?”

The thing inside the girl climbed onto my back as I lay on the floor. I shuddered; we know the touch of another person, and that’s not what I felt. The weight, positioning, and movement were entirely wrong, like I was being prodded by the furry legs of a distant spider instead of supporting a human being. 

A weight landed in my hand. I opened my eyes to see Grandpa laying the dagger that he’d used to slit Chet’s throat into my palm.

“What?” I mumbled.

Grandpa grinned at me, and I could only see teeth that should have been in his mouth but weren’t. “There’s no give without *take*, Charles.”

The monster in the shape of a girl smiled and turned her head to expose plenty of neck. “Cut me up, Charlie!”

“No,” I moaned. “No, I *know* there’s still a child inside that body. I’m not going to kill her.” My hands shook, but I didn’t release the blade. 

“It’s the only way,” Grandpa said, his voice thick. “Say his name *very* clearly when you do it.”

I looked up to see him gazing down at me, nose hairs pulling in and out as he breathed. 

“No,” I whispered, closing my eyes. 

“She was never going to survive this, Charles.”

I dry-heaved again. 

“But *you* have a choice between a life of meaning, and a return to the countdown before your final overdose or alley fight turns you into an unclaimed John Doe at the county morgue.”

I sobbed and retched. 

“The difference is that you always sacrificed what you could control out of anger for what you couldn’t.” 

Fury shot through me, and I rose to my knees. “Fuck you.”

Grandpa smiled. “The child is suffering, Charles.” He handed me the card, currently adorned with an eye that was now open. I took it without a word. “You can’t save her, but you can set her free.”

That did sound nice.

“Cut my throat open, boy!” screamed the thing inside the girl as she grabbed my wrist with ice-cold hands, pressing the card against her own forehead. 

My arms shook as I clutched the knife in one hand and the card in the other, neither advancing nor retreating.

“You’re only as weak as your last decision, Charles,” Grandpa explained in a quiet voice. “Start making up for your entire life.”

I took one, two, three shallow breaths and leaned away from my own decision as I plunged the knife into the little girl’s throat. “Come… come into me, M-Mammon.”

Her all-black eyes flipped to cerulean blue and human. Speaking was impossible, because I’d shredded her vocal chords and trachea. The last communication she ever shared was a profound look of confusion and hurt as she stared at me, searching for but not finding a reason why I had hurt her so badly. She died before growing old enough to understand how to hate.

The card burned like an electric current was running through it, hot and overwhelming, as though I was on the opposite side of a vortex when the world turned inside-out. 

Just like the first time I tried meth. 

All of the windows shattered as my head spun with an energy that balanced me, so I stood. I felt angry because I was *right* and the pulsing energy of my own head finally drowned out the noise of a world that wouldn’t shut up. 

Looking down, I saw the little girl gasping like a fish, like a gutted fish, and I nearly broke.

Then the energy flowed through me, I felt *wonderful*, and I was strong enough to look away from the mess that I’d created. 

I squeezed the dagger. Blood squished through my fingers. 

Grandpa’s eyes grew wide with glee. “You’ve *done* it, Charles.”

One punch was enough to send Grandpa sprawling to the ground. 

*Now*. Now he was going to see me for the first time.

I had so much energy that I walked to the third-story window, opened it wide, grabbed the exterior bricks, and climbed to the roof, smiling and [licking my lips](https://www.reddit.com/r/ByfelsDisciple/).

The events in this story took place between 2011 to 2016 so please forgive me if some of the details are a bit fuzzy now. I'll try my best to tell this story as accurately as possible. The detail of events is limited to what I witnessed and what my family was willing to discuss with me. I'll start with what happened to my father since he was the first one to suffer from sleep paralysis and see where the sleep paralysis demon was coming from.

It all started about 3 months after we had moved into the house. I was at my mother's home the night this happened and didn't hear the story from my father tell a few years after my own experiences. My father had woken up around 1:00 am unable to move his body. While he was starting to panic from the inability to move his body the tiny door to a storage room connecting to the master bedroom started to slowly open. This only caused my father's panic to skyrocket as this shadowy cat started to walk toward him. After this cat-like creature had slowly crawled toward my father, the creature stared my father down with its red glowing eyes and then returned to the storeroom. My father had then suddenly regained the ability to move and sat straight up while panting heavily. Causing my stepmother to wake up and ask, "What's wrong."

My father told her, "It's nothing just had a nightmare."

My stepmother fell back to sleep just as quickly as she woke up. After my father had calmed down and was about to go back to sleep he noticed that the door to the storeroom was wide open. He told himself he had just forgotten to close it properly after he had gone into the room earlier that day. so my father then went back to sleep. My father would have a few more nights like this one over the next few months. Until one night the creature came out and sat on his chest. My father felt the creature slowly start to get heavier and heavier causing him to struggle to breathe tell finally his body could no longer take it and he regained his ability to breathe.

This time my father finally told my stepmother what was happening these past few months. She told him, "it was just a night terror and not something to worry about too much."

When my stepmother had gone back to sleep my father looked over and saw that the door was opened once again. That's when he had enough got up and went to the local Walmart and bought a sliding lock. He had installed the sliding lock that night before going back to sleep much to the annoyance of my stepmother.

 After that night my father was no longer suffering from sleep paralysis. It was a few months later that I would start to experience sleep paralysis similar to what my father had experienced. But since that part of the story is a bit longer I will write that in the next post.

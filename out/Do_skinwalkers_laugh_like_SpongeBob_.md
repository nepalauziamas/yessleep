This is something that pops back up in my mind from time to time (usually in my nightmares). 

So this guy I dated for a pretty long time in college was really into camping. He told me he use to go camping with his family all the time growing up so it was something he loved to do. 

Admittedly I wasn't the biggest outdoors type person so as a substitute for camping under the stars, I agreed for us to rent a cabin on a campground for weekend getaways.

We had both just finished the last of our finals for the semester and were ready to celebrate so we started planning for a cabin getaway with my best friend and his gf.

After about an hour drive we made it to the camping grounds, parked our car and after picking out the rooms we wanted, got the celebrations started. I liked the campgrounds we always went to, they were pretty spread out from other cabins so you had a decent amount of privacy and didn't have to worry about disturbing other people with your noise. 

We spent the evening drinking, grilling and playing table top games we had brought. My friend group is bad at pacing ourselves so by 10 we were almost ready to call it a night. 

We cleaned up our mess and my ex was able to setup a Mobile Hotspot and link his laptop up to it.  All of us were painfully undecisive so we said screw it started streaming SpongeBob from Amazon Prime while vigorously drinking bottled water so we could all avoid hangovers the next day. 

We watched around 5 or so episodes together before we all were about ready for bed. So we packed up the laptop, said goodnight and headed to bed. 

I was able to sleep for an hour or so before I was awoken by the sound of loud moaning and a headboard hitting a wall. I knew my ex was a light sleeper so I rolled over to see him looking at the ceiling with a  heavy annoyance on his face. We made eye contact and laughed, maybe from the sheer awkwardness of hearing our friends going at it. 

However neither of us wanted to continue to listen to the loud ass humping going on so we grabbed my ex's vape pen and headed outside for some fresh air. 

We sat on the bench right outside of our cabin and smoked and just chatted for about an hour. Maybe it was the moonlight but things got a bit frisky and we ended up making out. 

As things were getting a bit "handsy". I noticed I heard what sounded like clapping from somewhere in the distance. I knew my ex heard it but I had to practically shove him away and force him to stop and listen. He joked that maybe it was someone else having a bit of fun, but it just didn't sound like that to me. 

We were about to pickup where we left off but my heart damn near exploded through my chest as I heard a laugh coming from somewhere in the surrounding woods. A human laugh was one thing , but there was no reason for SpongeBob's laugh to be coming from the woods at 1am. Anyone that has seen one episode of SpongeBob can instantly recognize the laugh so I know what I heard. 

I felt my ex tightly grab my wrist so I knew he had heard it too. We heard it over and over .It sounded like it was coming from a  ways away but it sounded so clear. It wasn't a continuous laugh either, instead it would start and stop over and over. It would start, last for about 3 seconds, then start a second or so later.

 I'm not saying no other campers could have been assholes but I really don't think SpongeBob was camping in the area.It must have went on for about 5 minutes before it suddenly stopped. 

My heart was pounding hard but I didn't even feel like I could move.

I  slowly got to my feet and tried to  tell my ex we should head inside when I heard a loud-ass voice yell "Hey". It didn't help that this also sounded like SpongeBob's voice but it sounded slightly deeper and had a weird echo to it.  
 My ex jumped up this time  finally realizing we were about to be in some bizarre Nickelodeon horror movie. I tried grabbing his arm and pulling him inside but he litterally wouldn't budge. 

 That's when I heard something go zooming by my head and smash into a tree right to the left of us. When I say smash I mean it. Whatever hit the tree hit it so so hard I thought the thing would split in half.  I didn't need to witness anymore and turned to sprint inside. Thankfully my ex was right on my heels. 

We locked the door behind us and headed to our room locking that door as well. We both laid there awake for the rest of the night listening and waiting for the laughing to start again or for something to go flying through the window. 

What we did hear was three solid and loud claps from somewhere close to our cabin followed by the sound of a bunch of wood cracking. It only happened once bit it gave me the energy i needed to stay awake until the sun came up.

As soon as we heard my friend and his gf moving around in there room my ex and I ran to knock on there door to let them know what we heard . It took us a while to actually convince them but after we finally did they both looked pretty shook themselves.

We decided to call the campground facility management office who assured us this had been one of there slowest weekends regarding bookings, and that noone had booked any cabins nearby. 

With that information combining with no one wanting whatever we heard to give us another visit, we decided to cut our weekend trip short.

This is also probably a good time mention that we went outside to see if we could find whatever hit the tree next to us. It took us about 10 seconds to spot the football sized rock that had been launched at the tree along with the large crater it had created in it. I promise you this made us only pack up 10 times faster. 

We made our way back home and after we had unpacked I wanted to do a bit of paranormal research on the area. Turns out a very small group of people think the area is frequented by skinwalkers, as people have heard voices of there friends coming from the woods at night along with a couple sightings of a tall slender man with long hair, wondering around near cabins.

Yeah we begin to frequent alot more beaches after that.

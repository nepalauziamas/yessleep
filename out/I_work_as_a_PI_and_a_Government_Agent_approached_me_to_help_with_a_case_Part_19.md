Being your own boss has its ups and downs. I can pick my own cases and hours. If needed, I can go off to work with Nick without needing approval from someone else. There wasn’t too high of a demand for a P.I. in my city, so I could take time off without too much work piling up. But I underestimated the amount of paperwork I’d neglected while going off to play agent with Nick. I needed to buckle down and get the mountains of it all done. It would be faster hiring an accountant for my taxes and other such things, but the habit of being cheap when I didn’t have money to toss around still remained. I sat in my office away from the distractions of my apartment trying to get through everything I’ve neglected to file for months. It was tempting to turn my phone off but I kept it on vibrate in case Nick called for something. 

A few hours in, I got desperate for anything to take my attention away from my real job. The distraction came as a knock on my office door. Normally my jobs came through my phone, no one ever showed up to my office unless I expected them. I wondered if it was the landlord and panicked thinking I had somehow forgotten to pay rent that month. I hurried over to open the door and at first, didn’t see anything. Looking down, a creature stood there waiting to be acknowledged.  

She was short, only about to my waist. And definitely female. With some supernatural creatures, gender a murky thing and almost impossible to determine at first glance. My face flushed looking down at her because she wasn't wearing a top. Instead, her hair was styled in two massive braids that covered her chest. I honestly hoped those braids didn’t shift or else I may not be able to remain professional. 

 “May I come in?” She asked, her face tilted upwards.  

I nodded nervously, standing aside to let the little creature in. From how her body was shaped, she logically shouldn’t be able to stay balanced. She was... very well rounded. Somehow all of her important features filled out and yet her waist was fairly small. Her legs should not be able to support such a top-heavy body. They were very thin at the ankles and feet about the same shape and size as cat paws. She padded over to a chair and carefully lifted her small body up into it with grace and practice. It was clear she adjusted to being in a world where nearly everything was made for someone much larger than herself. Her hair was a dark green, almost mossy. It reached the ground and I swear it was magic. Somehow it kept her back covered as she moved. The only clothing she wore a square piece of cloth hanging down around her waist that also magically kept her covered even while she lifted herself onto the chair. On her face was a wooden flat expressionless mask. If she wasn’t wearing it, I bet I could see her have an amused expression as I stared at her, cheeks red over her lack of modesty.  

A small hand motioned towards my desk telling me to take a seat. I was flustered and took a few seconds to take the hint. After I sat down, she started on the reason why she was there. 

“My name is Feenea. I work as a receptionist for the Mail Company.” She started. 

Pausing, she took a long wooden pipe she’d been using as a hair piece. She asked if she could smoke and I gave her permission. The bottom half of her mask came off revealing a normal face expect for a mouth of sharp teeth. Nearly all supernatural creatures owned pointed teeth made for ripping apart flesh. I never asked what kind of creature Aberash was, and she looked fairly human until I noticed how sharp her canines were. Even after dealing with so many creatures, the sight of those teeth still unnerved me. Putting all that aside, I thought I heard about mailmen before but never realized it could be a service for creatures of the night. 

“Uh... Supernatural creatures get mail?” I asked, still a bit rattled from her appearance.  

She sat, puffing on the long pipe and looking amused by the question. 

 “Since information is a currency in our world, there needed to be a safe way of delivering it. The Mail Company has been around long before The Corporation. Being a mailman is a very sought-after position. And very respected. Since they help make the supernatural world run smoothly, most do not harm the mailmen while they’re working.” 

This all sounded a bit strange to me considering their world had magic. Couldn’t they just use spells to get the letters or packages to the intended creature without a middle man? I asked Feena and she paused trying to word the explanation correctly. I respected the creatures I’ve dealt with so far, on how they understood I'm human and not part of their culture. It would be difficult to explain everything due to our species being so different.  

“Let’s say you wish to send a letter to a certain creature and you would like to use a spell to do so. Magic isn’t as powerful as humans tend to think. It’s possible to think around nearly every spell if you try hard enough. A creature could make a spell to instantly send a letter to a creature halfway across the world. But, let’s just say instead of a letter they sent an assassin named Letter to the other creature. It would still fall under the spell. Over five hundred years ago, The Hunters used a spell to send themselves directly to a great deal of creatures and slaughtered them. It was such a massive massacre that The Silver King stepped in and changed how magic worked. Right now, you are only able to transport something directly to a living creature if that creature gives their permission.” 

Feenea paused to take a large drag on her pipe. She blew out greenish smoke and for some reason it didn’t smell like anything. My head was swimming a little, trying to add what I had just learned to whatever little I already knew about creatures and magic. No wonder why Nick wasn’t great at using it. The whole thing was far more complicated than I ever thought. She also mentioned The Silver King, who I knew nothing about. He sounded like a big deal, but I had already let the conversation drift so far off-topic that I didn’t ask about him. 

 “Sorry, I derailed you a little. What can I help you with?” I asked finally. 

“As a receptionist, our job is to hand out packages and letters to the mailmen, but we also need to pick the right worker for the job. I believe you have someone who approves your cases and won’t let you take one over your skill level. Recently I started to look after three brothers who we just hired. They’re idiots, but hard workers. They’re currently missing and I would like for you to investigate the woods where I think they got lost.” 

I nodded along, ready to take on the job but then paused. Why did she ask me? Didn’t the Mail Company have some sort of way of dealing with their lost employees? I didn’t mind taking the job but found it confusing Feenea came to a human to help. 

“You know I'm only human, right?” I asked. 

“Yes, I am aware. Those three were lost while off the clock. Meaning our company won’t risk any mailmen to go look for them. The Corporation is always swamped with requests and won’t be able to get to looking for them for at least a few weeks. You may be human but you are aware of supernatural creatures. You’ve dealt with them and lived. And you’re not currently busy.” Feenea explained with a smile on her small face. Tapping out her pipe, she replaced it in her long hair. “I’m not asking you to save them, or provide the location of their bodies if they are dead. I just would like to know anything you can find about what happened. I cannot go into the woods they disappeared inside due to my species. The moss that grows there makes my race very ill. If I touch it by accident, I may die if I don’t receive treatment fast enough.” 

Now that explained it. She appeared to be the cool and collected type. Crossing her legs, she replaced the bottom half of her mask. But she wasn’t as relaxed as she appeared. I felt as if she was actually very worried about those three. Instead of waiting, she did something desperate and approached the only person who was available to at least try and find out if they had died or not. 

“If you’re able to get me to outside the woods where they disappeared, I’ll have no problem finding whatever I can for you.” I said as I stood up from my desk, ready to get started. 

 “We should discuss the payment for this job.” Feenea said. 

I shrugged, not knowing what to ask for. I doubted Feenea owned human currency. I still wasn’t certain what I should ask for when it came to doing jobs for creatures. I was trying to think of something, distracted, when Feenea slightly lifted one of her braids. When I noticed, I quickly looked away, my face flushing again. 

“I do dislike engaging with humans but I’ve heard males of your species greatly enjoys body types like my own. I can suffer through an hour or so if you-” 

 “No, not that. No thank you.” 

I cut her off, shaking my head and raising my hands. I would never going to exchange work for something like that. It was an easy thing for creatures to offer, so I had a feeling this situation would come up again. I glanced over at my new client unsure of how I felt. She was pretty, but so small. I couldn’t imagine anyone being attracted to her in that way because she was the same height as a child. Then I felt a bit guilty for dismissing someone based on something they couldn’t control. My mind was a mess and Feenea let out a soft laugh at my reaction. 

 “I do need to pay you. What would you suggest?” She offered. 

"We can put it off. I can just ask something from you later.” I said figuring that was the best idea. It had worked for Charlotte after all. 

But Feenea wasn't keen on the idea. She shrugged and it was her turn to shake her head. 

“I’ll give you some advice because you are human, but that kind of suggestion isn’t good for us creatures. We like our deals clear and up font. If I agree to speak about payment at a later date, you could twist your words and demand almost anything.” She explained, and I realized she was right. 

I needed to think of something to ask of a person I really didn’t need anything from. It's a good thing I was the one who she had approached. I felt as if a worse person would give into her first offer. I thought hard, desperately trying to think of something as she waited. As a minute or so passed, I felt a bit nervous over the fact that nothing came to mind. I heard her laugh again at my troubles. 

“You’re an honest human. I’ll trust you to ask for payment after the job is completed.” 

I let out a sigh of relief. I could put this off for a short while longer. With that cleared up I started to get ready to leave. I told Feenea I would need some supplies from my place. Going out into the woods without anything a very bad idea. My talents weren’t exactly outdoorsy. I should at least pack a bag with water and food for the trip. After all, three supernatural mailmen disappeared in those woods. Whatever happened to them may be too much for a human like myself to handle. Feenea agreed. She waited back at my office until I got ready. 

When I returned, I had a backpack, and comfy hiking shoes. She’d drawn a circle spell in the middle of my office floor to transport us. Luckily for me, those spells disappear after they're used or else my landlord would have some words. After I stepped inside the circle, it felt as if I missed the last step. My stomach lurched and my vision shifted. Instead of being in my office, we were both in front of an opening to the darkest looking forest I’d ever seen. Moss hung from the trees, blocking out the light. This place appeared so threatening even the air was heavy. 

Adjusting my backpack, I stalled from going inside. 

“I assume these three were collecting mushrooms when they disappeared. There are some that glow faintly in the dark and are a very nice snack when dried. If you find any, it would be a bonus if you brought them back.” Feenea told me, while staying away from the trees. 

“Do you have any more information on the ones that are missing? Their names and such?” I asked while looking towards the opening.

She did not have any photos of the brothers. She told me their names were Moses, Louis and Joseph. Two appeared human and around my age, while the third had a humanoid body with insect features. There shouldn’t be any humans in the forest, so if I came by any it was best to assume they were the brothers. I nodded, memorizing the few facts I had. 

“I’ve been told that information is like a currency in your culture. Aside from telling me what I need to know about this case, you’ve said a lot of stuff I would never find out.” I said, because it was bothering me. 

“Information is like a currency, however everything I’ve told you is common knowledge. At least to us creatures of the night. And when dealing with humans we tend to share more than normal knowing it would help the transaction. Unless you’re a Hunter that is.” 

That made sense. How the mailing company worked should be known by most creatures. Feenea wasn’t telling me any secrets when she explained it. At least it was good to know creatures would be more forgiving with information in the future. The friendly ones at least. I didn’t have anything else to ask so I straightened my pack again, ready to go.  

“Remember, I don’t need their bodies if they are dead. Just any information you can get. Don’t be too proud to run away if needed.” Feenea reminded me. 

I assured her I would stay as safe as possible. I only had my handgun and not the magic bullets Nick made. He hadn’t been able to charge the reloads yet, and I doubted I would be allowed to use them outside of cases together with him, as the bullets were still being tested. It would be nice to have a weapon more powerful than regular bullets, but I couldn't risk using an overpowered one either.  

As I walked into the dark forest all sounds dulled. It smelled Earthy, but with a hint of rot at the same time. This place really bad news and I shouldn’t stay here for too long. I gave Feenea one more glance over my shoulder, then made my way deeper along the trail into the woods. 

After what happened with the Witch, I swore I never wanted to go inside a forest again. And yet, I was doing a favor for a creature. I almost needed a flashlight to see in the gloomy place. Anything could jump out and I would be unaware. No wonder three supernatural creatures got lost in here. After an hour of walking, the trail became overgrown to the point it disappeared altogether. I would need to walk deeper into the woods. I paused to tie a piece of ribbon to a mossy tree branch. I needed a trail back and this was the best thing I could think of other than using spray-paint which I did not have time to buy. A dollar store near my place so I went with the ribbon instead of a wasting time on a trip to a bigger store. 

The progress slow. I made certain I made a clear trail back, all while keeping my eye out for whatever happened to the three brothers. Just as I felt as if I was on a hopeless mission, I spotted something. Through the trees a color that did not belong to the woods. I slowly made my way over to it, all the while looking around for any monster lurking in the dark. In the middle of a small clearing was a backpack. One of the reflective holographic ones that were all the rage years ago and now you can only find as a knockoff. It wasn’t a bag that might belong to a full-grown man, but then again, they weren’t human. Creatures did have different tastes. The bag half open. Peeking inside I saw some of the faintly glowing mushrooms Feenea spoken about. Well, it had been easy enough to find a clue. I picked up the bag to take it with me. 

The moment the bag lifted off the ground I felt something pull at my ankle lifting me into the air. I dropped the bag and I I flipped upside down, the contents of my backpack pouches dropped to the ground. My keys spilled from my pockets along with the fake ruby charm Nick gave me. I snatched it out of the air as my water bottle fell to the ground. I was not going to lose the only gift Nick had given me because I was stupid enough to get caught in a trap. 

Swinging very painfully from one ankle I stared at the ground trying to think of what to do. If I moved carefully, I could get the scissors I’d used to cut the ribbon from my bag and get myself free. It would suck falling to the ground, but at least it appeared soft. The task a slow and painful one. It took more strength than I owned to curl up and reach my ankle after I'd gotten the scissors. At least the rope looped around my ankle wasn’t that strong. Sweating from the effort, I paused because of how much pain my stomach was in. I’d only cut through half the rope but that was enough. My body weight did the rest. With a snapping sound I fell hard to the ground. It not as soft as it looked. 

The fall knocked my wind from my lungs. I felt like I was dying for a few seconds. I wanted to curse out who ever set that trap. I had the chance very soon. Sitting up, my eye caught some movement from the trees. When I looked over, my entire body felt frozen.  

A creature low to the ground stared, caught in the act of sneaking in closer. Four long arms came from its back to wrap around the trees near to it. Honestly, it appeared a little human. If only saw the face I would assume it might be a lost girl, hair dirty and tangled from being in the woods for days. The sunken black eyes didn’t blink as we sat in a standoff. 

Unable to think of anything else I ran, my pack slamming on my back with every step. I made the mistake of looking behind me just to see the creature coming after on all of its arms looking very much like a spider moving along the forest floor. 

 “Oh, fuck that!” 

I was very motivated to run even faster. Since starting to work with Nick I’d tried to get my stamina up, but I couldn’t stand a chance against something with extra arms to run on, while on its home turf. There was no way to outrun this thing. I stumbled to a stop to make a stand. My hands as steady as possible in that situation, I withdrew my weapon waiting for my shot. The creature came barrelling towards me. When it was a about a foot away, I started to unload as many bullets as possible into its face. It didn’t even slow the monster down. 

The thing crashed into me, sending my body flying. I rolled to a stop, in pain, my clothing torn. The monster didn’t let me recover. It scurried over and with its four arms wrapped a hand-woven rope around my arms pinning them to my body. I couldn’t think of anything to save myself. If this thing was only tying me up, then it may wait to kill me later. During that time, I could think of a way to get free. Unable to do anything else, I let it tie me up, then drag my body along the mossy forest floor to who knows where. 

It felt like hours of being dragged along. The forest grew a little bit darker. We were either going deep into the woods where the moss blocked out the light, or the sun was setting. Finally, I got dumped near some moss-covered boulders and the creature scurried away somewhere else. 

Sitting up, I looked around where I ended up. The creature had woven the thick moss into a blanket to cover the area. The place dark, the only light coming from a nearly burned-out fire pit and those glowing mushrooms peeking through the boulder cracks. The creature also had a collection of animal bones it had fashioned into crude art sculptures around its small camp. This place scary as all hell. I needed to get out of there. The creature did not tie up my legs making it so I could move around. I didn’t see or hear the thing. Who knew when it would come back for me.  

By sheer luck, I found a sharp piece of animal bone laying in a pile that was waiting to be made into something. I could grab it with the fingers peeking out from my bindings. The next few minutes were spent dropping the bone and cursing, as I made slow work at cutting the rope. Every sound made me jump and my heart nearly stop, thinking that creature was back. My hands ached and my chest was sore from not being able to breathe in fully for so long. 

I nearly cried when the rope snapped, allowing me to get loose. I should have gotten the hell out of there the moment I was free, but foolishly decided to just peek around the camp for a few seconds to see if I could spot any signs of the three mailmen.  

Getting down low, I silently walked around looking past boulders for the creature or the three missing men. I went in the other direction I’d seen the creature go and found myself following the opening of a cave. More mushrooms grew, giving me just enough light to see by. I figured I would spend a few minutes looking around and I would get out. Again, a miracle happened and I found what I was looking for.  

I spotted three forms slumped over in the back of the short cave. Quickening my pace, I went over to see if they were alive or not. Each appeared to be breathing which was a good sign. The insect brother was a bit startling to look at. His skin was white and hard-looking, as if his face covered with a shell. His black bug eyes weren’t closed, but then again, I didn’t think bugs had eyelids. I was at a loss of what to do. I didn’t want to just leave them there. In the end, it was the only choice I had. At least I knew they were alive. If I could get out, I would call Nick and ask him for some help saving them. 

I hurried out of the cave, again being as silent as possible. It appeared I got too silent. Just as I was leaving the cave, the creature of the forest was rounding the corner not aware I was on the other side. We both froze, startled by each other. I moved first and bolted trying to get away. The creature reached out a long arm, slashing it down my back but only cutting deep enough to tear open my backpack and spilling its contents. 

As it hooked its clawed hand into the fabric, it caught, causing me to stop and fall over. I scrambled trying to get back up, but my legs were shaking too hard. I was breathing so heavy my vision blurred. In that dark camp I faced death. It only needed to raise one more hand to end my life. I fully expected it, my mind blank from fear.  

The creature had a hand inches away from my face, when it paused. When my backpack was torn, all my food scattered. A reflection of the wrappers caught the monster's eyes, distracting it for a moment. I stared, still scared to death, as the creature’s attention was drawn away. A torn open chocolate granola bar was within reach. It snatched it up, sniffing the small piece of food and looking very interested. I watched, my horror fading to a manageable level as the monster shoved the entire thing in its mouth, torn wrapper and all.  

I could have run then. But I would only get a few seconds head start. Instead, my mind was racing as I watched the creature look for another granola bar. It learned the wrapper tasted awful on the second bar and started to tear it off whenever it found one. I had a full box inside my backpack. Before it finished off the box, I’d gotten an idea. 

“I can get some more of those for you…” I said in a trembling voice. I may have a plan but I was still scared as hell. 

It paused, looking at me. Eyes dark under tangled dirty hair. I didn’t know if it could understand me, but I kept speaking. 

“I’ll trade you. My life, and the lives of the three you already have for as many of those bars as I can possibly get for you. I mean, isn’t that a good deal? I can toss in other food too. I bet you’re tired of eating the same thing all the time.” 

For a few seconds it looked as if my words worked. Then I had the monster on top of me. It was pinning my arms down to the ground with such a powerful grip I couldn’t move. Drool dropping from a mouth of sharp teeth onto my shirt. I flinched as a long tongue came out from under the hair to lick the entire side of my face. My skin prickled in goosebumps, and my body was shaking. After an eternity, the creature grabbed my face with two hands so we were staring into each other's eyes. 

“Deal.” 

The voice so low it sounded more like a faint breeze then a word. I got released as the monster scurried off to retrieve the three mailmen it kidnapped. I stayed on my back, staring up at the dark mossy covered tree branches. I just couldn’t believe I traded my life for snacks. I didn’t know whether to be happy, or insulted that I was worth so little. In the end, I thanked Nickie for showing me supernatural creatures loved human foods enough to trade for them.  

I left what remained of my backpack at the camp the monster made. It dragged all three of the brothers out and I didn’t know how I could get them back aside from carrying them one at a time. The creature dealt with that problem. It started to draw a circle around us. It used a different language, but I could tell this was a spell. It moved very fast at making it. In under a minute the monster had the spell finished and activated. 

I felt so dizzy I nearly fell over. The bright sunlight stung my eyes after being in the dark for so long. My new surroundings left me disoriented for a few seconds. The creature had dumped us outside the forest. It stayed between trees, watching us. I opened my mouth to say something when a voice I recognized called my name. 

To my surprise, Nick came running over with Feenea in tow. She rushed over to the still sleeping brothers as Nick stopped in front of me with a crease of worry on his face. 

“Are you alright? You were gone for a week.” He told me, and I stood shocked. 

That was impossible. It was a few hours at most. If I was really gone for that long I would have starved to death. The three were slowly coming around. One sat up and Feenea started to berate them for being stupid enough for getting lost. Instead of getting angry she yelled at them, once all three were awake they piled in on her for a hug. Each swearing about how sorry they were aside from their insect like brother who simply chirped.  

"I really wasn’t gone for that long, was I?” I asked, while watching the happy reunion. 

“There are spots in the forest that mess with time. Who is watching us from the woods?” Nick asked, not looking alarmed at the creature that still stared at us. 

I gave him a very quick rundown of what happened and what I promised to get set free. Nick thought the creature I made a deal with may be a type of Witch. He would know more about what kind if he looked it up. But right then we needed to figure out how to buy a lot of granola bars and get it over to the Witch that spared my life.  

Nick surprised me when he said he could easily make it. He might need a second person helping to quicken the process if he made a big batch. My eyes travelled down to Feenea who stared back, her face hidden by a mask. I figured out something I could ask of her as payment. 

I only got close to the woods to tell the Witch it might take a few hours but I would be bringing what I owed her. I took her silence as approval. Her face still scared the hell out of me and I would be glad to never have to see it again after I fulfilled my end of the bargain. 

Nick recruited Feenea’s help. He overtook my kitchen because she couldn’t go to his house. Mine small compared to his. There were a lot of things I never thought I would ever do. Making granola bars for two days straight, running on very little sleep in order to feed a creepy inhuman forest Witch something I would never have even considered. Thankfully, we finally finished the last batch.

As we unloaded the last of the bars, the Witch took them with her long arms while staying in the dark forest. 

 “This is enough. Make more if you are alive when I wake.” 

Her voice again so soft that I wasn’t certain I heard it. She took her prize deeper into the woods and I collapsed against a tree with a loud sigh. Nick stood with me and looked down wondering if I was alright. 

“I believe that Witch is the type to drain the energy from living creatures then sleep for a hundred years. She invades nightmares and mostly lives in dreams. What we gave her is mostly junk food. She’ll be awake in fifty years or so asking for more.” Nick explained. 

I didn’t know when he had the time to find out what we were dealing with while working in my kitchen for two days. Then again, he might have had the information hidden away in one of the notebooks he always carried.  

 “I guess I’ll deal with that when it happens.” I replied. 

At this rate I wouldn’t last fifty more years. I’d barely got by in this job. Looking back, I really don’t know how I’ve lasted as long as I have. Still, all of this wasn’t enough to convince me to stop taking cases that dealt with supernatural creatures. 

“How come you accepted this job? Aren’t you a private detective for humans?” Nick asked, which was very understandable.

“I had the spare time and felt like helping out. I don’t mind accepting jobs like these but I should really get a special weapon. Maybe I can ask Matthew to make me something...” I trailed off, thinking about the now Ex-Hunter who almost killed me the last time I had accepted a case directly from a supernatural creature. 

I felt eyes on me. Looking up, I met Nick’s as he stared down, not knowing who Matthew was. It occurred to me I had never actually told him about Charlotte’s case. I might have mentioned her name in past text messages but never told him what happened. As I explained, he slowly started to sit next to me with his eyes staring forwards. Only until after I finished speaking and Nick didn’t reply I realized he was freaking out. Not once, but twice I had accepted a supernatural client and nearly died. Nick too busy to help and nearly lost his friend. He was... uncertain of how to deal with the idea.  

“Call me next time.” He said finally. 

“What if you’re busy? I just got unlucky with these two jobs. I might come across an easy job from a creature that won’t-” 

He looked over, dark eyes piercing into my soul.  

“I'll make time. Call me.” 

No room for argument. Nick would not be able to handle it if I got hurt when he wasn’t around. It was nice to know someone cared so much, but not nice if I had to refuse a request because Nick wasn’t available. I would call him, but I would still go on a job even if he wasn’t free. 

“I promise I’ll call you.” I said.  

I felt Nick grab my hand as if I was going to die on the spot.  

 “Double promise me.” 

 “Double promise.” 

His concern might be a result of losing his last partner. Or it could be from what I found in the Catacombs. He'd lost so many people in his life. And yet he picked a weak partner who barely survived on every case we took. I really needed a special weapon because I refused to die for my partner’s sake. At least after this disaster of a case, I doubted any other creatures would ever trust me again for a job. 

“I think you already have a few minor cases lined up. There aren’t many humans who can deal with creatures and the only other option is trying to get The Corporation to deal with the case. We are still so short on agents I have a feeling you'll be high in demand.” 

My stomach dropped at Nick’s words. With a combination of working cases with Nick, and accepting ones directly from creatures, I was definitely not going to last another fifty years.

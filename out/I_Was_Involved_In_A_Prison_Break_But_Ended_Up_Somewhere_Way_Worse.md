I didn’t believe the sentence when it was handed out by the judge. I couldn’t. I’d always believed, one way or another, justice would prevail and false convictions were something of myths and catastrophizers. 

But now here I was, on the wrong side of one. The sound my wife Jess made, while sitting in the benches behind me with our four year old daughter, Scarlet, will chill me until my last breath. 

Twenty five years. Scarlet will almost be thirty by the time I see her next. As a free man, anyway. How the fuck did this happen? I went back over the night that caused this, for the millionth time. 

I’d been angry that day, sure. I’d always had a temper. That was what the prosecutors had keyed on, and it worked out well for them. They marched in witnesses of all kinds with anecdotes and examples of my quick loss of composure during confrontations. They’d even used our neighbours.

I couldn’t argue against anything they were saying about my past. It was all true. Maybe a bit slanted, but I *was* quick to blowup on occasion. Especially when it came to Scarlet. I’d never felt protective over anything like I did the moment she was born and I saw how vulnerable she was. 

Scarlet had always been curious about our neighbour, Mr. Monahan. He was of the old guard, vending machine generation, but was sweet on her. We’d let her go over to visit, and he’d had some kind of treats or snacks for her. 

One afternoon though, Scarlet came back crying. She’d been drinking some lemonade, but had dropped the glass and broke it on the floor. Monahan spanked her. Jess and I had never laid a hand on her, and weren’t planning on it being any part of future punishments. Scarlet was just too sweet and never did anything wrong. 

When she told me what happened, all I could see was red. I was overcome with rage and rushed over and confronted Monahan about it on his front lawn. It was heated, I won’t say it wasn’t. But it wasn’t physical. Either way, several neighbours witnessed it, and that was offered up as motive. 

On the stand, I explained what happened that night. I’d calmed down and decided to go and speak to Monahan a little after nine. When I got there, his backdoor was open, so I entered and called out his name, asking if he was home. 

And then he stumbled out of the shadows and into me. He was covered in blood, a knife sticking out of his chest. I lost my balance and we collapsed on top of each other. I tried to help him, and made the biggest mistake of all. 

I pulled the knife out of his chest. He immediately started bleeding out worse than he had already. But even more frightening… my fingerprints were now all over the murder weapon. Jess came in at that moment and saw the scene. 

If you ask her now, she’ll say she knows in her heart of hearts I didn’t do it. But in that moment, when she came in and saw Monahan and I on the ground, covered in blood with a knife in my hand, I saw it in her eyes. She believed I had. And who could blame her? 

There’d been a full investigation and sweep of the house. No signs of forced entry. Just me. No witnesses, just my word against their perceived version of reality. 

My lawyer filed an appeal immediately, but that was a Hail Mary, especially without any new evidence. 

Twenty five years.

Everything after sentencing moved quickly. I was shuffled away before getting to say goodbye to Jess and Scarlett. Before I knew it, I was chained to another inmate and a dozen of us were being loaded onto a reinforced prison transport bus to be taken to a max security facility. I was gonna be bunking with the worst people in the state. 

The man, if you can call him that, I was chained to, was named John Wheatley Jr. He was a filthy psycho with long, stringy hair who never stopped talking. I heard his whole story before the bus even left the courthouse. Him and his father had been serial rapists, terrorizing up and down the west coast, through Northern California and up into Oregon. During a sting to catch the duo, John had been caught but his dad got away and was somewhere out there. 

John seemed to have all the stats on everyone on the bus, including me. He spoke about the two guys next to us - one was the tallest, largest black man I’d ever seen. He had to lean forward because his head rubbed against the ceiling while he was sitting. His name was Don Richter, but people called him ‘The Richter Scale.” He was a drug dealer who had been given a bad batch and his mind had gone off the deep end. He’d killed everyone in his apartment building, and stacked their bodies in the furnace room, planning to burn them and the property before he was discovered. 

He was chained to a man named Colson Lang. Colson was a bit of a celebrity in the world of serial killers, apparently. He’d been a BTK copycat - Binding, Torturing, and Killing his victims. John said his IQ was off the charts, and he’d been a software developer with a family of six at home. They had to change their name and moved to a new state when Colson’s extracurriculars were discovered. 

The bus finally started moving, and everyone got quiet. Except for John. He was excited and had that Orange Crush stained smile. I don’t think his teeth had ever been clean. 

It was a six hour drive to the prison through stormy back country, and all I could think about was the judge handing me my sentence. Twenty five years. There goes my life. 

I tried to sleep on the drive, but it was no use. I didn’t think I’d ever fall asleep again. John nudged me, getting my attention, and said to “brace for impact.”

I had no idea what that meant. I opened my eyes and realized we were now driving through old farmland and a heavy storm had started. John was facing the rear of the bus, his back pressed up against the seat in front of us. He told me to “brace” again. 

At that moment, I looked ahead. The two police cruisers that were escorting us suddenly spun out of control and went off the road, like their tires had gone out. Then our own tires blew out, and the bus flipped and barrel-rolled into a ravine. 

I blacked out, but was awoken by gunfire and John yelling for me to get up. We’d been dislodged from our anchor points on the bus, but still chained together, and John was pulling me towards the rear doors. Richter and Colson, still chained together, were following our lead. 

The back door of the bus was bent in, but Richter used his shoulders and broke it outwards. Gunfire outside the bus continued to spray, lining the ceiling with holes. 

John pulled me out of the bus and was trying to look around to the front, but the storm was raging too hard. It sounded like there was a shootout between the one or two remaining officers, and someone else. 

Then I heard John yell the word “Dad!” And it made sense. His dad had orchestrated a transport intercept to get his son out. And now we were a part of it. 

Bullets were spraying everywhere and we couldn’t see what was happening from down where we were. Richter and Colson started booking it towards a large, dying cornfield. John, pissed off from abandoning his father, grabbed me and told me to run. 

I was operating on pure adrenaline and felt concussed from the accident. It wasn’t immediately obvious to me what I was doing, and how guilty it made me look to run. I tried to stop, but John yanked me forward and said he’d kill me if I didn’t hurry as fast as I could. 

I knew, the further I ran, the longer my sentence would go. But in the moment, I was too terrified to stop. What was waiting for me in prison anyway? Claustrophobia and daily shower rapes? 

Colson led us into the woods beyond the cornfield, and we found ourselves following a stream for a mile or two. We came out on the other side of the woods and found ourselves in a large clearing. There was an old farmhouse ahead. It looked huge and out of place. Run down and forgotten. 

That’s where we were headed. As we got closer, my fear grew more and more. What was I doing with these three maniacs? 

We got to the house, and above the threshold, the words “Pickaway House” were carved into the frame. We pushed the door open, and entered. 

The house appeared abandoned. Colson gave directions that we needed to find tools to break the chains, clothes to change into, and weapons if we could. Quickly, we found a hammer and axe. We broke the chains, and the three of them rushed upstairs to look for clothes or weapons. I grabbed an iron poker from the fireplace and managed to pry the cuffs from my wrists. 

Finally with a moment to myself, I sat down by the window to catch my breath. I started to think about Jess… I wonder what she was doing right now. How long until the news picked up on this. And how long until she found out I was a part of a jailbreak. One I didn’t even want to be a part of. 

The idea of running back to the bus came to me. But… what if I got back, and these three got taken later? We’d all end up back in the same jail, and they’d know I ran on them. That would undoubtedly make my jail experience far worse. I didn’t know what to do. 

Then I saw the tree-line with dozens of agents holding flashlights and moving through the woods and into the clearing. It was both a relief and horror to see them. Now I didn’t need to run. But this could also turn really bad. What if there’s a stand-off? What if John, Richter and Colson find guns upstairs? 

Then I heard John yell out. He was upstairs looking out the window and saw the search party entering the clearing. And approaching the farm house. The three men rushed downstairs, still in their orange jumpsuits. Richter and John freaked out, but Colson kept his head. I could tell he was very cerebral. He was formulating a plan. 

We were all going to go into the basement and hide. As the search party entered, we would take one officer out at a time, strip them and wear their uniforms. Then we would rejoin the search party, in their place, and split up, going our separate ways from there. It was a pretty good plan. For them anyway. I wanted no part of it. But I kept remembering, if I backstab them and we all end up back in prison… they’ll kill me. Or worse. 

So I kept my mouth shut and decided to follow whatever they said. But we couldn’t get the basement door open. It was solid. Not even Richter could pull it off or break it down. 

Colson ordered us upstairs where we’d hide in one of the rooms. I followed them up and saw the second floor for the first time. There were four bedrooms, all empty. We piled into the closet in the master bedroom, the plan staying the same. 

I couldn’t imagine us surviving this. I imagined the cops turning the corner, seeing us crammed into the closet, and opening fire. Why wouldn’t they, they probably thought we were responsible for the deaths of all the cops in the transport. What a horrible feeling, thinking I’d be dying in some strange closet with these monsters. 

But minutes were passing, and we hadn’t heard anyone come into the farmhouse. Were they setting up a perimeter? Formulating their own plan, knowing we were likely hiding inside? A few more minutes passed, and Colson decided to look outside. 

And that’s when everything became *really* strange. 

The search party had walked right passed the farm house. They hadn’t come in and checked or anything. In fact, as I looked out the window and watched them, it seemed like they didn’t even *see* the farmhouse. Like they looked either right passed it, or right through it. We watched as the officers and agents continued across the field. They set up a large search party headquarters a few hundred yards away. More and more officers and agents arrived. Were they waiting for the army to show up? 

The storm was still raging and the day was descending into dusk. We moved downstairs and watched the search party. They’d spread out all over the county it looked like. I could even see them going into other farms in the far distance, and searching through them but finding nothing. 

It dawned on John that as long as we stayed inside the farm house, the search party wouldn’t be able to find us. We just needed to stay here, inside, until they passed fully. Then we could make our run for it. 

John and Richter were thrilled with this. It was clear they weren’t the slightest bit worried about why no one had come in to find us. Or had even been able to see the farmhouse. I shouldn’t have been surprised they weren’t that worried. Anywhere was better than prison for these guys. 

I could tell Colson’s mind was running though, trying to make sense of it. As was I. But there was no sense. Either the search party didn’t want to come in, or they flat out didn’t see the house. 

Either option was frightening, and I wanted out. I hatched a plan to try to sneak away that night when the others were asleep. I could get to an officer and explain what happened. Tell him where the others were hiding. I might sound crazy but… this was all crazy. Since the arrest, everything felt like a nightmare had spilled into my reality. 

An hour later, it was pitch black out… and the storm had gotten worse. We couldn’t even see the search party anymore, outside of their dim headlights through the rain. 

John hadn’t stopped talking, and was more or less celebrating that we were safe and clear. Though… he was nervous his father had been killed in the shootout, and was cursing himself for running off after the bus flip.

Colson was quiet. I could tell he was taking it all in from different angles. He went upstairs and John followed shortly later. 

I stared out the window in the living room, watching the storm coming down and thinking about Jess and Scarlet. I played out scenarios in my head where one night I show up at home and we get all our money and make a run for the border and raise our daughter in Mexico. It was a crazy idea, but I figured I was looking at an additional ten years now for being dragged along in this stunt. So it was either thirty five years, minimum behind bars. Or run. 

I had a lot to think about tonight.

Not to mention the fact… that there was something wrong with this farmhouse. And I had a disturbing feeling that when we try to leave in the morning, it won’t be as simple as walking out the front door. 

I turned away from the window and was startled by Richter. He was standing in front of the basement door, fixated on it. He made me so uneasy. He easily had over two hundred pounds on me, most of which was raw, animal muscle. He was about six inches taller than me, and the last person I wanted to be alone in a room with for more than a second. At least his attention was on the door, for now. 

My adrenaline rush was finally starting to drop, and I felt sleep coming on. I tried to stay awake, but it was useless. I fell into a deep, nightmarish slumber. It was filled with horrors, but none worse than the last one. The one that rang true. I’d gotten to Jess and Scarlet, sneaking home one night, and I asked them to run with me. Jess had said no. Hearing that word gave me more pain than any I’ve ever felt, awake or asleep. 

I woke up as a roar of thunder shook the farmhouse. But I could’ve sworn I heard a scream layered in with it. I took in my surroundings quickly, and realized I was alone in the living room. Face pressed against the window as the storm continued to rage. Aside from being alone, only one thing seemed different from before I fell asleep. 

The basement door was wide open. 

I picked up my fire poker and approached the doorway. I looked down, and despite it being dark, I could see a shape standing at the bottom of the stairs. The shape was so large it was undeniably Richter. But he was trembling. I could see his breath, even from up here. 

I backed away, thinking about shutting the door and locking him down there. But figured I didn’t need to give him a reason to try to kill me. I moved into the kitchen instead, and decided to sneak out the back door. Now was the time to take my chance at running. I’d go to the cops and tell them what I could. However the cards dropped from there, I’d have to live with. 

But the kitchen door wouldn’t budge. The knob wouldn’t even turn. It was frozen into place. I fumbled with it, trying to assess whether it was jammed or stuck. But it felt like I was trying to move a part of the wall. There was no give at all. I thought about breaking the window, but knew that would be too loud. So I took a rag, wrapped it around my fist, and gently pressed it against one of the kitchen window panes. It wasn’t budging either. I tried to apply more and more pressure, very slowly, so it’d cause the glass to crack but not shatter. 

But again, it felt like I was pushing against the house itself. We were trapped inside. At least on the first floor. Maybe I could find a breakable window upstairs. I wasn’t crazy about the idea, as I didn’t know where John or Colson were. And what they might do if they found me alone. I didn’t trust anyone here. I didn’t even trust the house. Maybe it was paranoid, but *they were* violent criminals. What was one more murder during a prison break? 

I nervously carried my fire poker upstairs, but found the hallway had changed since I’d first come up when we arrived. The hall had gotten longer, and now had four doors on each side and one at the end. I remember there was only four in total before, but somehow they’d doubled. Had I misremembered it the first time? 

I walked forward, passing the first two doors. Neither of them had windows. They were both covered in wood panel walls. I knew that wasn’t right. I’d seen windows in them earlier. I continued on and found all eight doors led to more rooms without windows. 

The final door led to a room that was filled with stacks of newspapers. And a window. On the far wall. I went to the window and looked out. The search party appeared to be moving away as the storm was getting heavier. I tried to press against the glass again, but it wouldn’t budge. It might as well have been cement. 

My attention turned to the shortest stack of newspapers, which was beside me. It was spanning back decades, even a century. The headlines were for a serial killer who’d been arrested, but escaped prison and disappeared. The next one was for a mass murderer who’d gotten away during a police pursuit, and was now missing after a baffling disappearance. Then another… But this one had John Wheatley Jr on the cover. It spoke of him and his exploits. I flipped it over… 

The next one horrified me. It was a newspaper that had next week’s date on it, but looked like it’d been there for fifty years, just like the rest of them. It spoke of the prison transport bus being intercepted by John Wheatley Sr, who’d died in the ensuing shootout. And of the convicts that managed to escape. And had not be found. 

There was my name. My face. 

I backed away, not wanting to read any more, but went right into another pile, knocking it over. The pile spilled across the floor, headlines filled with articles on killers and rapists disappearing. Large manhunts spreading across states. Even the country. But never seen again. And my name and face was there. Scattered amongst them. 

I got to the door, but found the hallway was gone. I had to catch myself against the door frame, because I didn’t see the floor was now stairs. Ones that led directly to the basement. 

Somehow, I was standing over the basement stairs, the doorway out to the hallway was now a doorway down. At the bottom of the stairs… was John, Colson and Richter. They were staring up at me, waiting. 

I tried to step back, but found the room was gone now. There was nothing but a wall at my back. And it was pushing me forward, down the stairs. To the others. 

The lone bulb overhead dimmed out, and I lost my balance, toppling forward. I prepared to feel the hard stairs crack against my body, but they never did. I fell into darkness and just kept going. 

My mind started to move too fast, and I couldn’t keep up with my thoughts as I fell through weightlessness. My temperature shot up, like a fever had gone from 0 to 100 in under a second. Brief, aggressive flashes of my life began assaulting the inside of my eyelids. The road rage, the drunk nights out that resulted in fights, all the more destructive parts of my life, fused together in one frightening reel. There were things I felt bad for. Even really bad. And things I felt I’d handled the right way, even if they’d be viewed as excessive by some. But now, like this, everything felt horrid. I felt the weight of every poor decision. Every attempted justification for my actions. 

The last flourish of memories was from that afternoon with Monahan. The argument on his front lawn. The anger I felt. How I very nearly hit him, right there. My fist was clenched and I was ready to. But I held back. 

Then… it was him on the kitchen floor in my arms, the last breaths of life draining from him. But nothing in between...

The memory flashed out and my eyes opened… I was laying on dirt. It was cold and wet. I got up and realized I was in the basement, at the bottom of the stairs. It was so dark, the only light coming from the open doorway above. I couldn’t tell if the room was twenty feet wide or perhaps twenty miles. 

There was a series of low thuds coming from somewhere upstairs. It was methodical, like a metronome. I managed to get myself up the stairs, the headache I had from the memory flood slowly subsiding. 

On the first floor… I followed the low thuds to the front door and found something that flipped my stomach. 

John was on his knees at the front door, a horrific croaking sound coming from him. He was banging his face and hands into the door repeatedly. As I got closer, I saw his face had been mashed in and his fists had been beaten down to bloody stubs. The door was covered in the gory smears left over from John’s face and hands. I can’t imagine how someone could still be operating their motor functions in this state. 

Then John stopped. He turned and faced me, and I saw his eyes were smashed in as well. But he acted like he was looking at me. A grin crept across his lipless mouth. He sputtered out the words, “There’s no way out.” Then he lunged at me. I fell backwards, onto the stairs up to the second floor. I swung the fire poker and cracked John in the head. He hit the ground hard but was back up and crawling towards me in no time. I rushed up the stairs.

But found the hallway was even longer now, with dozens of doorways on each side. John was crawling his way up the stairs, and I could hear other footsteps moving through the living room and kitchen below. There were other people down there. I rushed down the second floor hall, not knowing where I was going, but knowing I needed to find somewhere safer than I was. 

But as I went, I realized the doorways didn’t lead to other rooms, they led to more hallways with more doorways and *more* hallways and *more* doorways. They seemed to just keep going. Where the fuck was I? What was this place? Doorways and passages leading to more rooms. Staircases on the ceiling that led into basement’s above me.

Or were they below me? Was I upside down? I looked down and realized I was now walking on the ceiling. But then… it was the floor again. I felt like my brain was swimming and I got nauseous. I stumbled past windows, some of them looked out into endless fields with electric storms scorching the horizon, while others were more personal. 

One of the windows looked in on my living room at home. I could see Jess and Scarlet, on the couch, watching the news. My face was on the screen, among the other three escapees. Tears were streaming down my wife’s cheeks. Scarlet was crying too. She probably didn’t really understand. But… maybe she did. 

I saw shadows darting between doorways. Footsteps creaking from above, below, and all around. Something was chasing me from all sides. Some *things*. Then… I could hear that unsettling croaking sound John was making when he was destroying his face and hands. 

Colson’s voice called out from a different direction, asking what I thought of the house. All I could think of, was this place was like some kind of mousetrap for people like us. Like them. It appeared as a safe haven from our futures, a mirage like a piece of cheese, distracting us from its surprises in wait. But if that was the case, why was I here? Was it accidental? Or… did I actually belong here? 

Or the worst of all… had I actually committed the crime? Had I killed Monahan in a blackout rage and repressed it? It was a thought I’d kept as far away as I could manage through all this. But it was feeling more real. 

I turned down a new hallway, my will deteriorating as I heard the footsteps gaining. 

I ran into a new room, this one long and filled with varying sized frames with different mugshots in each. There were hundreds of them lining all the walls. I saw John’s, Colson’s and Richter’s in a row at the end. But not mine. Mine wasn’t there. 

I peeked out through the doorway in the hallway and saw three frightening yellow beams were piercing in from it like a series of flashlights. 

The source of the light appeared. It was from Colson. He’d been decapitated, and was holding his severed head out in front of him. The yellow light was pouring from his eyes and mouth like a grotesque lantern. He was calling my name from his severed head. 

I ducked out of the doorway, and rushed down a hallway leading into another room, but found John stumbling through it. Half of his head had been ground down to brain and skull, and his bloody nubs had sharpened bone spearing out. Somehow, I knew he could see me. The croaking came from somewhere at the back of his mangled throat. It screamed out, “He’s in here!” 

I turned to sprint through a new door, but found the way blocked by a large, mountain of a man. He was glistening in the darkness, and had to duck under the frame to enter. 

Colson appeared from another doorway, and I was bathed in the yellow light from his lantern head. He smiled, and pointed the light to the doorway with the large, framed man. It was Richter. He’d been skinned, with only bloody muscle, veins and ligament remaining. He walked through the door towards me. They all did.

I backed up but found myself against the wall. The framed mugshots were covering it, and several fell to the ground.

I was surrounded by the three destroyed men, and was quickly realizing I would soon be joining them in my own frightening state. What would they do to me? What would I become here?

I held out the fire poker, ready to start swinging. Colson said that wouldn’t work here. This house didn’t exist by our rules. But I would come to know them well. I didn’t care, I raised the fire poker like a baseball bat, and they rushed in. 

As they leapt towards me, I felt a change inside. An overwhelming sense of calm took over, like I was being protected somehow, by something. I shut my eyes and dropped the fire poker, knowing that swinging it, or committing any act of violence, wouldn’t save me anymore. If it ever could.  

But the men didn’t hit me. Nothing did. 

I opened my eyes and realized I was back on the floor, by the window in the living room of the farmhouse. 

Colson, John and Richter were scattered through the room, asleep peacefully on the ground. They were in their orange jumpsuits, and appeared to be completely normal and unhurt. 

Then… the front door creaked open. The rain pattering outside drifted in. I quietly got up, trying not to wake the three. 

The door was swinging gently from the wind. Rain was coming down sideways and into the entrance. I walked to the doorway and looked back. The three men were still asleep. This was my chance, and if anything I just saw was a prediction of coming events, I knew I had to take it. I walked out the front door. 

But as I did… my vision went blurry and overly-saturated, like it’d been hijacked by some pirated station. I can’t say why or how. But it was some kind of reverie. A vision from the night of Monahan’s death. 

It started with Jess and I in our living room mid-conversation. She was trying to convince me to go over and apologize to Monahan, or at least smooth out what happened earlier. 

But then all of a sudden, I saw inside Monahan’s house. He was in his own living room. But he wasn’t alone. There was a young man in there with him. It was clear the man was a junkie. They were arguing heavily. Parts of the conversation floated through my psyche. The young man was Monahan’s grandson, and had been on the streets for a year. He’d gotten by with little bits of support here and there, but had become increasingly reliant on crime. 

Tonight, being in a particularly bad way and needing more than usual, the grandson was denied money by his grandfather for the last time. An argument erupted, which turned into a full blown confrontation in the kitchen. And while I was being convinced to go over to apologize, Monahan was being murdered. 

His grandson… it had been his grandson the whole time. 

And with that, my foot landed outside the farmhouse, and rain hit my face. I was outside. I looked to the right, where there was open forest and a clear path to escape. I looked left, and there was the search party, a few hundred feet away, but blurry from the storm. 

The thought of continuing to run flashed through my mind. Making my way back home to Jess and Scarlet and getting us into Mexico, or further south. It was a fleeting thought though, and was gone before it came. 

I ran left, going for the closest cruiser. I had my hands up and open as I approached, and within seconds I was arrested. As I was thrown into the back of the car, I looked to where I came from. There was just an empty plot of land. The Pickaway House was gone. 

There were lots of interviews and interrogations after that. I made up a simple story that I’d been dragged along by John and the other two and we’d been hiding in a creek nearby. I was scared of them so I went along with them. They’d found tools and we managed to get unhooked from each other. The first chance I got, I ran for the search party. 

It played well enough. It wasn’t the truth, but somehow, it was more realistic than the truth. 

I had a discovery hearing with the Department of Corrections. It appeared to be more about me than about John, Colson or Richter. 

They wanted to know why I came back. Why didn’t I keep running with the others? 

I told them, because I wasn’t like those men. I had always believed in our justice system, but in a recent instance, that belief had been shaken after it made a terrible mistake. 

I told them I wanted to one day be able to legally walk my daughter down the street. Take her out for ice cream. A movie. Be a part of the family that she would eventually start. Though I was facing an impossible uphill battle and the potential of decades inside prison… if I ran, I’d never get the chance to have that with Scarlet. I would just always be running. 

I didn't want that. I was ready to stop fighting physically and to start fighting the right way. Starting here. Now. With some new information I'd recently uncovered about who actually killed Monahan.

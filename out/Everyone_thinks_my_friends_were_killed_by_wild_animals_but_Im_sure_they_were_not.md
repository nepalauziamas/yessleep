I'm a photographer. Frequently, me and my friends will go camping to areas we know capture great views. Sometimes these places fall across areas that have a lot of wild animals, but we take the necessary precautions and make sure we're prepared to deal an animal attack if it happens. It hasn't, but it's better to be prepared for something that doesn't happen than not be prepared and have it happen, right?

The camping trips aren't just for taking pictures, obviously. We'll get high, make s'mores, get drunk, etc. Just having fun. Now, what I saw that night may have been a result of me being high off my a--, but I'm sure it wasn't. I wasn't that high for the being to look so f--king demonic, I think.

Picture the scene. It's me and five others- Katie, Ben, Thomas, Vivian and Callum. We're all slightly out of it from cheap alcohol and "brownies." It's night time, roughly around 10pm. Everyone is relaxed and just hanging around the campfire. Katie and Thomas are very close to eachother, they might have been making out, but the light was dim and my memory of what happened before I left the camp is slightly hazy. I wander off into the woods because- I don't know, I was completely out of it- and get a bit lost. I don't have my phone. I have my camera, but nothing else. So I wander around blankly for what had to be a few hours, then I find the camp.

And what I saw will never leave me.

It was a being, standing over the fire. It had antlers, but it wasn't a deer. Whatever it was was standing on two legs, and it was thin, like very thin, and it had long gangly arms ending in claws. It had a long, pointed face, and it was eating something, I could hear the crunching as it splintered whatever it was eating, I think it might have been bones. It was just a black form, and it had pale eyes.

I was scared sh-tless, obviously, who wouldn't be? I didn't know what the hell was happening.

I didn't move. I just watched, from where I was near the edge of the treeline, out of sight of the fire. The being turned and galloped into the forest.

I moved forwards, and what I saw made me throw up right there and then.

All five of my friends were mangled. Some limbs were missing and they had huge chunks of flesh ripped out of them. One was unrecognisable as they had long gouges across their face and part of their cheek had been entirely ripped out, revealing their teeth.

I didn't know what to do, so I just legged it out of there without gathering any of my stuff. It took me roughly an hour to find the mouth of the woods, and I have never been so relieved to get out of somewhere. I went right to the police and tried to explain what I saw, but they could tell I was stoned and didn't believe me when I described the thing I saw. The autopsy of the bodies showed they had been mangled by something with very sharp teeth. Mountain lions were known to show up in the area we were camping in, so everyone just thought that my friends were attacked by a group of them.

I'm still a photographer. I still go camping. But I avoid those woods. I'd rather not encounter the demon thing I'm sure I saw. I most likely would not be as lucky as I was that night.

I'm a cyborg. I have a chip implanted into my brain that connects to the Internet. No, it's not as awesome as you may think. In fact it is downright horrible. Please let me explain.

My life chanced once and for all when I got into college. I used to be the smartest kid back in high school. I always took pride in my intellect. It was all I had. I didn't have any friends, but that was OK. I had knowledge, and that was all I needed. Grown-ups were always amazed at how knowledgeable I was, and grown-ups always know best, right? What did my stupid peers know anyway?

I worked hard to get into the best college I knew of. However, as I got in, I realized the competition was much more intense than I expected. And so from top of the class I became a mediocre student. I decided to work even harder. I started to neglect my health and sleep in order to study. Even that wasn't quite enough. I started taking supplements. Might as well have drunk rain water, it had the same effect. Then I started taking stimulants, first over the counter and then others obtained by less then legal means. That is when I had to get acquainted with the dark web.

Most people have the wrong idea about the dark web. It isn't very different from the clear web, it's just very difficult (not impossible, mind you) to find out who posts what, so you can find everything there from literally normie sites like Google, Facebook and Twitter to services offering guns, drugs and sex workers. Of course 90% of those are scams. But, who's gonna go to the police and say: I payed a bucket-load of money for speed and never got my delivery? You've really got to know where to go and what to ask for. It's all based on reputation.

I began by taking nootropics to help with my academic success. Then I got into micro-dosing various controlled substances. It all seemed to work like a charm at first, until I had a few health scares. I tried tried to quit then, but by this point I was hooked. By this point I had graduated, but I continued to use. To be clear, I wasn't what you would call a junkie. In fact, nobody really knew about my habit. I was even still very successful professionally.

I fell further down the rabbit-hole and discovered body hacking. I learned how to build and implant cybernetic technologies via self-surgery. A convinced transhumanist by now, I was spending hours on dark web forums on the topic. That is where I first came across an intriguing post: "Former \[redacted\] Corporation employees offer brain-machine-interface chip implant". One of the most respected members of the community was vouching for these people. I consulted with my contacts and, after much deliberation, I decided to get the brain implant, even though they asked for a not insignificant sum in Monero.

They had real doctors operating, and even though they operated in a warehouse, they had brought medical equipment and the conditions were surprisingly sanitary. The surgery was successful.

A few months after the surgery is when the nightmare started. I started having very intrusive thoughts. I remember crunching numbers in my mind, calculating how to best rob a bank in Dallas, a place I had never been. I somehow knew the exact dimensions of every nook and cranny and exactly how much time it would take the police to get there. The same day some other guy robbed that exact bank. He was never caught. I'd always do my best to distract myself from such thoughts but I was literally unable to. I was an unwilling accomplice to many such crimes ranging from kidnappings to robberies to assassinations.

I soon discovered that these were a "feature" of my brain implant. Others who had the implant had the ability to send data to other "nodes", i.e. brains, on the network, that were idle at the time. I discovered this when I accidentally broadcast the adult entertainment I was enjoying to other people, who then thought I was soliciting.

During the night it was even worse. I wasn't dreaming like a normal person any more. I was dreaming adds. Those weren't your average "Drink Coke"-adds, more like "Buy my new batch of \[insert controlled substance here\]" or "Want somebody dealt with? Email such-and-such".

Think how effective targeted adds on Facebook and Google are. Now imagine you are exhausted and a robotic voice insisting in your head that you buy some speed form a particular dark web dealer. 100% pure. 70% off if you buy in the next 10 Minutes. Or imagine you are having a fight with someone and the robotic voice nagging you to hire an assassin. Now imagine both of those are scams and there were never any drugs or assassins only charlatans who just took your money and disappeared, because that's what they probably are.

It got really unbearable. I thought I was losing control over my mind. I thought I was crazy and made the whole thing up in order to explain the intrusive thoughts and the voices. So I went to the doctor and had a full body scan. They saw the implant on the film and threatened to tell my insurance company and possibly even the police. I ended up having to blackmail them into silence.

I tried to disable the brain implant but wasn't able to by myself. I tried to hire somebody but it's very hard to find somebody with the technical ability and who is 100% discreet. Luckily the network went offline without warning. All of a sudden I was alone with my own thoughts and no-one else's. I was on the one hand overjoyed that I didn't have to listen to that awful chatter 24/7. I swore to God, I would never do anything so stupid. On the other hand, the quiet was unnerving. I couldn't stand my own thoughts anymore after what seems an eternity of listening to other people's thoughts.

Last weekend, however, it started again. Somebody brought the brain implant network back up. The infernal chatter drives me insane. It's a thousand times worse now, that I thought I was free. I've resigned myself. This is my fate now. This is my punishment for whatever it is I've done in a past live or this one.

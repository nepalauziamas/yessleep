My sister’s name was Angeline.

She was six years younger than me, which doesn’t really seem like much now. Back then, though, it was a chasm, very nearly the difference between a baby and a parent.

I wanted to like her. I wanted to dote the way my friends fussed over their baby siblings. I wanted to feel that affectionate, protective rush. Sometimes, I’d get up at night and sneak into her room. Then – praying to God all the while to make me care, to make me a good brother – I’d stare at her in her crib, sometimes for hours, willing myself to love her.

But I never did.

That’s not to say I was a bad brother. If anything, my own anxiety and self-loathing propelled me into filial superstardom. As if my actions could somehow make up for the ambivalent numbness that spread through me whenever I looked at her.

Angeline didn’t know this, of course. She didn’t just love me. She adored me, she *idolized* me, she preferred me to both our parents. She never wanted to be apart from me.

Until May came along.

I guess that’s the wrong way to put it. Imaginary friends don’t “come along.” They bloom inside the mind and sometime after, wither and die there. 

But the way Angie talked about her, you’d think May was every bit as alive – and important – as me.

For a few weeks after May’s arrival, I continued our usual routine: namely, I’d get home from school and ask Angie if she wanted to go outside, or watch TV, or play Super Smash Brothers.

“No!” she’d snap. “I want to stay in here and play with May!”

After several days of this, I began to wonder if Angie was testing me. If she’d figured out I had a hollow, unfeeling core and was trying to determine its depths. The thought scared me so much that one day, I finally asked: “Can I come in and play with you and May?”

“No! Girls only!” She sneered in that particular way of children, equal parts disgusting and adorable. Then she stuck her tongue out so far she was practically cleaning out her nostrils, and slammed the door.

Dim relief chased the panic in circles. Maybe she knew I didn’t love her. But maybe she had no idea, and was simply... outgrowing me. Yes. I allowed myself to savor the thought. It was quietly glorious, the emotional equivalent of the golden autumn sunlight streaming through the oak trees outside my window.

Angie’s relationship with May eventually strayed past the boundaries of her room.  It wasn’t anything remarkable at first: whiny insistence that May have a seat at the table  (“You will *offend* her! It is *bad* to *offend* my friend *May*, Dad!”), furious shushing if I happened to be playing videogames while May was napping.

It was fine, really, until she stopped sleeping.

That might be an exaggeration, but it sure didn’t feel like it. Our bedrooms shared a wall – good, thin, American plywood coated with the least amount of insulation possible – so I heard everything. I woke at all hours to her mad giggling and frantic whispering and jubilant scampering.

I didn’t care at first – I don’t sleep well at the best of times, so it made sense Angie wouldn’t, either. If this was her way of dealing with it, fine.

Except she started getting louder. Loud enough, finally, that our father – who couldn’t really be fussed with either of us and barely paid attention no matter what was happening – barged in one night. I heard a scuffle. 

“Stop!” Angie grunted. “You’re making May mad!”

A loud *crack* filled the air. Angie wailed, but cut off abruptly when another vicious *smack.* Then my father roared: “I DON’T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOUR IMAGINARY FRIEND! SHUT UP AND GO TO SLEEP!” 

The ensuing silence was more than silence. It was an absence, a fundamental darkening of the entire home.

My father stormed out, slamming the door with such force my bed rattled.

Angie wept, very quietly. I wanted to comfort her – or at least, *wanted* to want to - but wasn’t brave enough to leave my own room.

After a while, I began to drift. Somewhere in that twilight, a heard a voice. Low and raspy, like gravel and dead leaves and the distant roar of the ocean:

“*None of them love you.*”

“Devon loves me,” Angie hissed.

“*I feel his heart, darling. He doesn’t love you. He doesn’t love anyone. I alone am your friend. I alone love you.*”

My drifting stopped and somehow reversed, propelling me to full, stunned consciousness. I lay there, trying to understand what I was hearing.

“You’re wrong,” Angie wept.

“*Let me heal your heart, my love. Come with me. I live in a beautiful place below the park.*”

“I don’t want to live underground!*”

“*Not underground. Below. And you can come up any time, to play with all the other children. I will care for you, I will feed you, I will listen and play, and I will love you.*”

Angie was dangerously silent. “Which park?”

“*Any park. All the parks.*”

“West Park is my favorite.”

Another terrible silence. Then:

“W-When would we go?”

“*As soon as we can.*”

Her bed creaked. Small footsteps pattered across the floor, followed by a hideous, somehow squelchy lurch that made my stomach feel sick and watery.

I shot out of bed without thinking and ran into her room.

Something enormous – two or three times the size of our father – hunched in front of the window. It was almost incorporeal: dim white, flickering and dancing, twitching in a way that made its outline impossible to determine.

Angie spun around, looking guilty as sin. 

“Angie,” I breathed. “Angie, come here.”

The monster reached for her, flickering hands changing form and shape so quickly I could barely comprehend. Stretching, growing, into pale claws the length and width of pillows –

I darted forward, grabbed Angie by the shoulders, and shoved her out the door. The room began to quake, and an awful, itching sensation spread over my skin. Like static electricity, like swarming bugs, it enveloped me and for a terrible moment, I couldn’t breathe.

My vision swam and my legs became weak. I tried to stare at the thing in front of me, tried to see past that dim, ever-changing veil, but could not.
“*He doesn’t love you,*” it intoned. “*He never has, and he never will.”*  Then, after a sly, cruel pause: *“Perhaps I will not love you, either.”*

Then it somehow swarmed back, tightening and contorting in impossible ways, and shot out the open window.

Angie released a choked sob and ran to the window, staring hopelessly at the hypnotically starry sky. “No!” she whispered. “May! Come back! Come back!”

May did not come back.

After a long time Angie whipped around, face contorted in a hideous snarl, and stalked toward me. Tears spilled down her face, glittering like dim stars. “You made her mad! You made her mad at me!”

She hissed and spat and pushed me out of her room, then shut her door. I heard the dull click of the lock, and the muffled wheeze as she began to sob.

I didn’t move. I stared at her door for what felt like forever, like I was six years old again, looking down into her crib and begging myself to love her.

Only when the first golden mist of dawn bled into the hall did I return to my room. 

Angie was despondent, dull and wet-eyed for days. But one night I woke to the joyful hiss of her voice: “You’re back! You came back! Oh, thank you, May! I love you!”

Disquiet wormed its way into my heart, but I turned over and pretended I hadn’t heard anything.

Life returned to normal for several weeks. Angie was her usual exuberant, imaginative, intolerable self. I took my father’s lead and ignored her. She didn’t seem to mind. I heard her giggling and tumbling around every night, but I only heard her. No second voice, no heavy lurching. For a while, our shattered little household reached equilibrium.

But that changed the first Saturday in November.

The day dawned brown and clear and cold. Everything looked flat to me. Empty and dimensionless, somehow half-formed. Like a painting abandoned by the artist. 

Heavy thumping roused me from a warm, dreamless sleep, followed by a shrill giggle. I was an anxious kid, verging on insomniac. That sleep was the first good one I’d had since school started. And to be woken up early, on a Saturday, by my idiot kid sister and her imaginary fucking friend –

Her door – just a few feet away from mine – slammed open. Angie’s giggling suddenly shrilled to a scream. “No, May! *No*!”

The panic hit something on a primal level. I sat up, heart pounding. Unmoored anxiety crackled through my limbs and arrested my lungs. Only when my doorknob rattled – slow, I thought, and somehow mocking - did I understand what I’d been feeling.

For the first time in my life, I was worried about my sister.

Angie screamed again, full-throated and disconcertingly grownup. “NO! LEAVE HIM ALONE!”

My knob turned, and the door creaked open.

There in the wedge between frame and door, fully illuminated by the rising sun, was an enormous face: a perfectly symmetrical oblong with small, obscenely voluptuous lips and round blue eyes like coasters. They glinted and shone in strange ways. Despite the chill of the room and the bleak decay in the world outside, those eyes glittered like a wild, sun-drenched ocean.

That lush mouth split into a tiny, wicked grin. The stranger held a finger to its lips, pressing heavily into the rich red flesh. 

Then it whipped out of sight and slammed the door.

My mouth worked soundlessly. I tried to speak, but my throat felt stuck together. For a long moment, I thought I would throw up.

Then I screamed: “*Angie!*”

I bolted out of the room, heart pounding, and dithered by her door. I thought of that awful, obscene face, and bit back a scream. Tears stung my eyes. I didn’t want to go in, didn’t want to see –

But I couldn’t leave her alone with it.

So I burst into the room and froze.

Angie stood in front of her mirror. It was long and framed in beautifully carved wood, a gift from an old lady at our church. She was on her knees, whispering savagely as two gargantuan white hands slid back behind the glass.

The mirror flashed, as if placed in direct sunlight, and I *saw* it: hunched and huddled like a tall man folded into a moving box, head twisted and bent so that its cheek touched its foot. Impossibly huge, thin but obscenely *fleshy*: puffy and smooth, with dark hollows under its eyes and sharp plateaus in place of cheekbones. But – like an oasis in that ill, misshapen body – its tropical eyes continued to shine, promising warmth and life and freedom.

It pointed at Angie, then winked. The mirror flashed again, and suddenly the creature was gone.

Angie whirled around, mouth wide open. 

We regarded each other for a long, awful moment.

Then her jaw snapped shut. Despair darkened her eyes before spreading across her face, etching lines into her skin and making her look a hundred years old. Despair incarnate, trapped somehow in the body of a six year old girl.

“I see,” she breathed. Her face twisted terribly, and she began to cry. “I see in the mirror. She’s right. You don’t love me.”

“Angie,” I said. “That’s…that’s…”

She shook her head and turned back to the mirror. “Do you promise?”

That voice, low and dry and ancient and sick: “*I promise.*”
 
My sister stood up, sobbing wildly, and fell into the mirror.

I screamed and shot forward, mind teeming with images of Angie’s bloody face, punctured eyes, and ribboned skin. I closed my eyes even as I reached for her, anticipating the awful, shattering crash and her agonized scream.

But they never came.

I ran into the wall, hip clipping the mirror and sending it crashing to the floor. A thousand pieces erupted, glittering like fire in the rising sun, before cascading to the floor.

I surveyed the room, chest heaving, panic rising. Nothing. No Angie. Not under the bed, not in the closet, not behind the dresser.

She was gone, and we never found her.

My dad didn’t seem to care, and my mom wasn’t around to make him. I cared, though. 

I cared so much I wanted to die.

But life goes on. At least it did for me. In some ways, nothing really changed. After all, I’d barely spent any time with Angie in the months leading to her disappearance. 

I always remembered that voice, though, and its words: “*Any park. All the parks.*” And it promised that it loved her. It promised to take care of her.

So I have hope. Not much, but enough.

By the time she disappeared, I was already too old to loiter in playgrounds by myself. So I took up running. No one pays attention to runners, even in parks. So that’s what I do, every morning before work and every night after dinner:

I go to Angie’s favorite park, and I run.

It’s my excuse to watch all the kids. To scan the slides and swings and sand, to stare at each and every child, searching their faces for a little girl the rest of the world has forgotten.

I hope I find her, because I need to tell her I love her.

And I have to tell her I'm sorry.

\[INCLUDES SEXUAL VIOLENCE\]

&#x200B;

I woke up incredibly dizzy and completely unaware of what had happened. All I saw was darkness and I thought I was dead. Then, I felt the cold wind and it made me shiver a bit. My head hurt like hell so I lifted my right arm and put it on my forehead. I started to remember everything that happened. First, I remembered meeting with a man and a woman. Then I remembered that they were Johnatan and his girlfriend. When I remembered the naked people with masks, it felt like someone hit me in the head again. I gritted my teeth in pain and inhaled. I also squeezed my left hand into a fist and felt like I grabbed something. I quickly looked at my left hand and lifted it. My hand was filled with grass and dirt. I couldn’t really see it but I could feel it. I looked up and saw the beautiful but eerie silence of the stary night sky. The moon shined brighter than I remembered it shining before. I could see the outline of the canopies trying to reach high.

I remembered where I was hit and gently put my hand on the area. I gritted my teeth again and inhaled. At least whoever hit me didn’t hit me that hard. It knocked me out easily, but it didn’t leave a bleeding wound nor did it give me a concussion. I took in a deep breath and grunted as I tried to stand up. At first, I stumbled toward my car and I needed to lean onto it. I stood there for a minute while waiting for my legs to adjust. I remembered the naked woman I hit in the head and expected to see her broken skull laying on the grass just in front of me. I looked down... but there was nothing. The woman wasn’t there. I quickly looked around the area, but I couldn’t see anyone.

I decided to check if I can find the other bodies. Johnatan was hit by the shovel and could have died from the hit. His girlfriend was definitely dead. The neck wound she received from one of the naked women was lethal without a doubt. I killed that naked woman with my gun and expected to find her body as well. I took a few steps and stumbled again but kept myself standing straight. I looked to my right where I last saw Johnatan and his girlfriend. I could barely distinguish it from the dark grass. A darker mass was spread on the grass. I realized it was a body. I walked up to it and seeing its haircut, I realized it was Johnatan. His girlfriend and the body of the naked woman were nowhere to be seen. Rage overcame me and I spat on Johnatan’s head. I thought he was dead and, at that moment, I was kind of glad.

I closed the trunk of my car and sat down in the driver’s seat. Before trying to start it, I took another look at Johnatan and chuckled. I put the key in and turned it. The car didn’t start. I was terrified. I tried turning the key again and it didn’t work. I tried franticly turning it a few more times and it never worked.

“Fuck. Fuck! FUCK! FUUUUCK!” I shouted louder each time while hitting the wheel with both of my arms.

I leaned my head onto the wheel but didn’t press hard enough to honk. I was taking in deep breaths and turned my head towards Johnatan. And then I remembered. Further away, I barely saw the outline of Johnatan’s car. If my car’s battery didn’t run out and the lights turned off, I wouldn’t even remember the car. I got outside my car and closed the door behind me. I walked up to Johnatan’s body and bent down. I searched his pockets for the keys and stood up when I found them. I realized that Johnatan and I were the only ones left even though there were three other corpses. I kept looking at Johnata and realized there was a possibility that Johnatan was still alive. I crouched down and put my fingers on Johnatan’s neck. It took me only a few seconds to put my fingers on the right part and I felt the pulse.

I stood up and contemplated leaving him there and decided to do so. Before I went to his car, I searched the ground for the gun, but I couldn’t find it. I saw my bat in the trunk of my car before I closed it a minute or so earlier. I took the bat and walked up to Johnatan’s car. When I opened the trunk door of his car to put the bat inside, I was surprised. Random stuff was all over the place but what surprised me was rope and tape. Dipshits wanted to kidnap me if I didn’t bring them what they wanted. That immediately gave me the idea to tie up Johnatan and put the tape over his mouth. Taking him to a cottage my grandfather left me was the best idea. It was isolated and not too far from the clearing. I wasn’t there in a few months but it is a well-kept cabin with running water and electricity. I usually go there when I want to be alone for a few days and when I want to relax.

When I tie Johnatan and taped his mouth, I put him on the backseats. The car started as soon as I turned the key and the lights turned on. The sight in front of me was beyond terrifying. By the way I’m describing it, you might think that someone or something was standing there or maybe something even worse. It wasn’t. It was so much simpler but so much scarier at that moment. There was no blood on the grass. It was like nothing happened. There should have been so much blood from the naked woman I shot and from Johnatan’s girlfriend, yet there was nothing. What scared me even more is that the dents in my car were fixed as well as the window.

“How the...” I asked myself.

I sat there staring at it for a minute. After snapping out of it, I slowly left the small clearing and climbed onto the road. After 10 minutes we got to the cabin. During the entire ride, I felt like I saw the naked people standing just out of sight but they never reacted to me. I stopped in front of the cabin and dragged Johnatan into it. He wasn’t too heavy but he was still a grown man so I was a bit exhausted when I dropped him on the floor. I put him on the chair and tied him to it. I just had to wait for him to wake up. I had a stove, a coffee maker, and some coffee from the last time I was there so I made myself some. There was a cellar just a few feet away from the house. My grandfather and father kept some wine and liquor there while they were still alive. It was some quality shit. The bottles must have been at least 50 years old and since there were about 20 of each, it seemed like opening one wouldn’t ruin that ‘keep for special occasions’ thingy.

I went back inside and poured some of it into a glass and drank it slowly thinking about what was going to happen when Johnatan woke up. I got to the half of my glass when I heard a grunt. I’m a slow drinker when I don’t drink to calm down. He didn’t move at first. He let out another grunt as his head started to lift up slowly. He was squinting to the point that his eyes were almost completely closed. It seemed like he was trying to breathe through his mouth but the tape forced him to take in deep breaths through his nose. The next grunt sounded like he was trying to say something but was completely unaware of the situation he was in.

After his eyes opened a bit more, he saw me sitting in a chair about 3 feet away from him. He sounded angry. It didn’t take him too long to realize that he couldn’t speak and move. He looked down at the rope and then back at me with a furious expression. I tried to speak with him but he let out loud angry grunts and shook around. Fortunately, it made him tire out quickly so he just started to listen.

“Okay, so to start off, you’re a little piece of shit, aren’t you?” I told him. “With all that blackmail stuff.”

His eyes said it all. He wanted to kill me so badly.

“Now, this is how it’s going to end. You’ll destroy all the evidence you have about me and in return, I won’t arrest you for blackmail.”

He looked confused. I felt like he wanted to say something so I took off the tape. He spat on the ground next to him so I went to put the tape back.

“Wait, wait, wait,” he started. “I didn’t mean it like disrespect. I just couldn’t swallow more of it.”

I let go of the tape and left it hanging from his right cheek.

“You seemed like you wanted to say something.”

“Why the hell would you let me go?”

“Because of your sister,” I answered. “Honestly, I couldn’t give two shits about you, but I do care about your sister. Kaley is a good soul and she would hate me if I arrested you.”

He chuckled.

“What’s so funny?” I asked in an uninterested tone.

“My sister loves you. She loved you ever since she met you.”

“I... I noticed,” I replied.

“You’re such a dickhead. She was all over you and you never even looked at her. I always thought you were just an oblivious idiot, but it seems like you’re just a jerk.”

“Yesterday, she asked me to talk to you,” I told him.

His expression became one of seriousness again.

“She was afraid for you after finding you in a bad state that morning. You do know how much I hate you?”

“Yeah,” he replied. “Almost as much as I hate you.”

“Right. Yet I still told her that I’ll talk to you. Why do you think I did so?”

“I don’t care...” he reluctantly started to say before I cut him off.

“Yes, you do. You care because you want your sister to be happy and the only way, she’ll be happy is if I’m with her.”

He didn’t know whether to be furious or cry judging by the expression on his face.

“So, it’s a miracle that I feel the same way.”

Now, he didn’t know whether to smile or scream at me.

“She kissed me on the cheek yesterday and it just woke something up in me. I liked her before, but this was something else. Something more.”

“You’re a fucking liar,” he spat. “That’s all you are. You don’t love her; you don’t care for her. If you did, you wouldn’t have gone out with that little bitch two days ago.”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“Your pretty little bitch. Who do you think I’m talking about?” he asked smiling like a psycho.

It took me a few seconds to realize what he was talking about. As soon as I did, my eyes widened and rage overtook me. I stood up and punched Johnatan in the face so hard I almost knocked him out again. I also shook my hand a bit to get rid of the pain as Johnatan spat out blood.

“She’s not my little bitch,” I told him furiously.

“Whatever you say,” he smiled. “There’s still evidence out there. There’s still evidence that you fucked a minor.”

Hearing him say that surprised me more than anything in the last two days. I stopped shaking my hand and widened my eyes. When Johnatan realized I was just standing there, he looked at me and was surprised by how surprised I looked.

“Why the hell are you looking at me like that?” he asked.

“What did you say I did?”

“YOU. FUCKED. A. MINOR!” he shouted. “And now you tried to make me think you like my sister.”

“You don’t know the truth,” I whispered happily.

“What?” he asked more confused than ever.

“You don’t know the truth. I never touched that girl in my life. I’ve never even thought of it. It feels like she’s my little sister. Just like Kaley is for you.”

“What happened then?” he chuckled. “You are such a liar.”

I sat back down in my chair and told him the entire story of how I met Clara.

“So, she killed Cameron Waynewood? And you knew it?”

It seemed like he got some respect for me after hearing that. Everyone from law enforcement hated Cameron so that made him calm down a bit and listen to what I had to say.

“No, she didn’t,” I told him. “I killed him. When Clara went to her house, I broke his skull with the rock. Cameron was still alive when she left and I needed to protect her. I lied to her. I never told her that I killed him and she’s suffering because of it. However, I just can't admit it.”

“I saw her at Waynewood house a few times,” he told me.

I looked up at him and he understood that was a sign to continue.

“Helen, Cameron’s daughter, went to my class. We were in a relationship for some time and while I was there, I saw Clara visit Hector. She wasn’t' the only one. It was usually a group of people.”

Hector was Helen’s brother. Clara told me that they went to class together but nothing more. I asked him about him a few times but she said that he stopped hanging out with people after his dad died. I hate myself for that too. I ruined a kid’s life by killing his father.

“How old were they at the time?” I asked him.

“I don’t know, man,” he stopped to think. “It was maybe like 2013 or 2014.”

“The thing with Cameron happened in 2015. Maybe he forced himself onto her before that. I only wonder why she didn’t tell me stuff like that.”

“By the way, why are you telling me this? You know that I can use this against you?”

“But you won’t,” I told him. “Now you know that I’m not a piece of shit you always thought I was and you just couldn’t do that to your sister... and I also have evidence for your cocaine addiction. If you take me to court, I’m taking you down with me.”

His face was serious for a second when he started to laugh. I laughed with him. It was a nice bonding time.

“Okay,” he said breathing heavily because of laughing. “Can you just untie me now that you know I won’t attack you?”

I took a knife and started to cut the rope.

“Oh, yeah. I promised Kaley that I’ll talk to you about that thing that happened in the morning.”

He took in a deep sigh.

“It’s probably going to sound crazy, but I have evidence that it’s real. So, I went to sleep completely okay. Nothing bad happened that night. However, I had this... weird dream.”

Hearing him say that made me look into his eyes. He looked back into mine.

“What?” he asked.

Earlier when I was tying him up, I tied him below his chest so his arms weren’t tied from the elbow up. I immediately decided to cut open his right sleeve and check if the scar was there.

“Hey, hey, hey. What the hell are you doing?” Johnatan asked me as I put my knife on his arm.

I pulled the sleeve away from his skin and cut it. I teared it up a bit and the hole revealed the scar. I stood up and took a step backward.

“How did you know about it?” he asked me terrified.

I turned to the side and lifted my sleeve showing him my scar.

“Dude,” he stopped for a second. “What the hell?”

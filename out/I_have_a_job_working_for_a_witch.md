Where to start…well firstly my name is Deacon. My very few friends call me deek and I'm a monster hunter. I know. Who isn't right? I've read a few of the posts on here of people who supposedly kill the things that go bump in the night. Most of them are complete bullshit but some are strangely accurate. I almost have to wonder if they're real. Honestly some probably are and they're just disguised as stories so people can vent about how fucked up our jobs are. Oh by the way this job seriously fucks you up mentally. Yesterday I saw a giant spider with the eyes of a fucking human and I barely even flinched. It's almost like my emotions are dulled…then again I did have a military grade shotgun and I've killed literal demons so I guess that's expected.


So let's start with how I got into this line of work. When I was 16 I used to work in this shitty gas station in Detroit. I was at the time trying to work my way through college and working nights. It was incredibly boring but hey, it paid well, I was able to be extremely lazy, and I had plenty of time to text my now ex-girlfriend. 


So on a Saturday night I'm sitting there at the counter and the phone rings. It was an old landline that almost never rang, which was odd that it did all of the sudden…I picked it up anyway in case it was important. 

"Hello?"

 I kind of sounded like a nerd…I was so I don't really feel bad about it but it wouldn't have killed me to have sounded less like a scared kid who'd just lost their mom.


 "Hey, I know this is a strange request but can you bring some paper towels and a pack of condoms across the street to the MGM hotel room 1408?" 


The voice on the other end was deep and mature. Not like old but more like the voice of your high school star quarterback. I could practically see the gym freak that was on the other end of the phone.


"Dude this is a gas station not a-" 


"I'll pay you 200 bucks." 


Now this guy was speakin my language. 200 dollars just to walk across the street and hand some guy a bag of fun for the night? Beats playing angry birds on my phone. "I'll be there in 5 minutes." I hung up the phone and got up to get the things the guys wanted, some paper towels and condoms (extra small to be safe) and ran my skinny ass right over to that hotel with a dumbass smile on my face.


 I was already thinking about what I was gonna do with that money…pizza and the most recent call of duty this weekend was at the top of the list. This was the easiest money I'd ever made and I was planning to stop right by GameStop first thing in the morning and join my buddies for the weekend…but then again. I had a hot girlfriend whom I loved very much at the time. You know what? 


"Fuck the games."


 I said out loud. Angel, my girlfriend deserved a nice night out. I'd been taking her to that shitty Chinese place for every date and…honestly I wanted to show her how much I liked her.


I get up to the room about 4 minutes later and I knock on the door. 


"Dude, I got your condoms. Open up."


 "Hold on~" 


I…heard a girl's voice on the other end and when she opened the door I instantly recognized her. It was my girlfriend, Angel and she had a guy named Dave who was currently giving her one hell of a hickey. Long story short she called me a loser, said she was way out of my league, and she even broke my prescription glasses when she slapped me…didn't even get my 200 dollars.


As I'm crying and heading down the stairs I couldn't help but think I'd seriously messed things up. Angel was by far the best girlfriend I'd ever had and I'd just lost her. My dad always told me that if you didn't take care of your woman someone else would. Little did I know my night was about to get a lot worse. 


When I got back down to the lobby it was empty. At first I didn't really pay it any mind…it was late but come on. This was a luxury hotel and it was empty? Even the woman at the counter was gone. I looked around and I noticed the faint singing coming from the dining room... I walked over and that was the first time I saw her. Blair. She had eyes that were indescribably dark…it was like staring into a void. But her voice…damn her voice was amazing. Everyone that was in the lobby was watching her…Men and women alike open jawed as they watched Blair sing on the stage at the end of the dining room. They were all stage side, some even reaching out to try and grab her. Her voice was almost hypnotizing… It felt like I was melting…if I hadn't recently had my heart stomped on I might've fallen into her trap. You see…Blair is one mean bitch. I value her as a friend and as my employer…but holy shit I've seen her to some pretty messed up shit.


I'm not sure exactly what she is but somehow she charms people. It doesn't work on married people who and I quote 'Who's heart belongs to another' mine must've still belonged to Angel because unlike the other 30 people in the room I didn't start to fight over Blair and I don't mean try to seduce her I mean these guys were biting, kicking, and bludgeoning each other


"What the fuck!?"


I yelled out, watching these guys literally kill each other. I mean shit you'd react the same way. This of course caught the attention of one of the Crazies. Yes, that's what I call them, starting to run at me. She was the woman that had been at the front desk when I came in. She tackled me to the ground and I screamed like a little girl.


"H-Hey get the fuck off! What's wrong with you!?"


I yelled out firmly as I not so firmly pissed myself. I forgot to mention that crazies aren't exactly human. From what I can tell once you get charmed by Blair you sort of…lose your humanity. For instance the lady that had tackled me had her skull caved in, which didn't stop her from biting her teeth down over and over, trying to take a chunk of my face off. Fortunately we were in a dining room and I was able to ahold of a steak knife and I used to stab whatever the fuck that thing was in the throat a few time. That was my very first kill, a category 1 monster.


"I…I just killed someone…Holy fuck…holy fuck holy fuck holy fuck…"


"You sure did handsome~" 


The tall woman with jet black hair and eyes said, now behind me sipping some wine. I got up, rolling the corpse off of me and stammering to my feet. I'll be honest…I was crying and probably going into shock at that point which caused me to blurt out:


"WHAT THE FUCK!? WHO THE FUCK!? WHAT IS THIS!?"


Blair just smiled at me. I was covered in blood, my own piss…and tears not to mention I'd just been attacked by someone WITH THEIR SKULL CAVED IN. Blair seemed to just peer into my soul. The other people had all killed each other except for one and as the last one ran at me, a chef by the looks of it with a knife. Blair would raise her hand and twist her wrist. I shit you not this guy was lifted up into the air and his body…twisted in opposite directions. It was almost like he was a piece of paper and he was being twisted by two hands. As I watched this guy basically get drained of his fluids I would break down, dropping to my hands and knees…I honestly thought I was about to die…but then I heard Blair ask me the question that'd change my life forever.


"You want a Job kid?~"

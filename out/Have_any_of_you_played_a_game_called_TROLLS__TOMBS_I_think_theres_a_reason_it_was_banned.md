There is a moment, at the beginning, when it’s like how it used to be.

J is making some joke, standing and waving his arms around - some half-imagined impression - and Slade is howling that wild and broken laugh, and Nat is trying to stop them both, trying to reign them in but losing herself in the moment too, her head in her hands and her back shaking as she laughs so hard she cries.

It does not last long enough: J looks up, catches sight of the empty chair, and I can tell, imagines Caleb’s response. Imagines the way Caleb would have built on his impression, would have said something that made Slade laugh so hard they hit the table - whispered something conspiratorial to Nat that would have made her grin, made her see herself as part of it all, as a force for good.

I try and busy myself: hand out the pre-made character sheets, check that everyone has their dice. We were so close to starting last time that I don’t feel much need to explain it, Caleb had assigned us characters, gone through the rules, and we’d been set to meet the next day.

We’d all woken that morning with a quiet sense that something was wrong, and as we gathered on his doorstep, one by one, the realisation lay a seed and grew inside us like a cancer.

He’d have been so proud: the banned game - TROLLS & TOMBS, one of the few remaining copies found in some second-hand shop down the road, and his favourite people to play it with. He’d joked about the apparent rise in suicides from people who’d played it, the blurring of reality, the testimonies of people who claimed that the game became more real than life itself.  It could have just been a marketing strategy, madness pervades the CASTLE, but Caleb seemed adamant that no, there was something special about this game, and we were going to find out what. That’s what had made it so unexpected, so-

I digress. Our evening plays out without him now, months later, a parody of what it could have been.

I watch Slade eye their phone: chewing their nails, waiting until someone takes the attention in the conversation to give it another look. I know what they’re thinking of, their plug who doesn’t live too far from here, how easy it would be to make an excuse to leave, that small plastic bag in the palm of their hand and the feeling of relief: of that tingling that spreads from their nose to the front of their skull.

I try and distract everyone, make moves to start.

There’s an awkward discussion about whether it feels right to keep the fifth chair in place - whether that’s what he would have wanted, whether it’s a morbid reminder of something we need to move past. We can’t make a decision, and instead elect to have it tucked into the table: present, but unused.

I can tell our minds are occupied to begin, wondering what the ethics of this are, plowing on with a game he suggested but could never play, whether it’s alright - allowed - to have fun without your friend once they’ve passed.

I try to distract them: start the game.

The premise is simple. You will play as the characters given, try your best to embody their flaws and their strengths, and hopefully, work together to solve the mystery of the Lostwood Valley and the Black Castle that presides over it. If the players are smart, and resourceful, then they too may be able to discover who or what THE SICK PRINCE truly is.

I play a low, dark ambient track, wind howling, rolling drums, guttural and melodic whispers.

We begin.

*THE FIFTH CASTLE resides upon LOSTWOOD HILL, casting its many eyes over the valley, its shadow long and prying. Its crooked windows and obsidian towers leer over the tiny village of MORT, which sits in the valley like a spider trapped in the sink. The locals speak with shivers of the way the wind howls through its turrets, how night seems to pour not from the sky but from its walls, and the way even the stars above it seem to hide themselves.*

*It is vast and dark and empty.*

The players lean in. I have their attention now.

*You find yourselves walking these halls, cold, alone, and with no memory of how you arrived, in a dreamlike state of acceptance. Perhaps, you think, the world has always been like this: cold and looming and labyrinthine.*

*Oxmourne picks his way blindly, the half-orc druid no stranger to darkness. There is something here though, something new, something evil, which he cannot put his finger - or his paw - on. He mutters something in an ancient tongue and a small burst of white flame erupts from a green fingertip. Although the flame goes some way to fight the darkness, Oxmourne notices a bitter irony: whilst he now has a source of light, it only serves to cast yet more shadows.*

Slade nods, checks their character sheet, lights a cigarette. The tip hisses as they inhale: the same strange flame that illuminates those castle halls. Caleb had always said Oxmourne fit them the most, mysterious, stubborn, watchful.

*Radford picks his way along the halls, muttering prayers half-remembered to Gods half-trusted, realising now perhaps what is the true strength of faith - the power to believe that something, someone, might hear them, might be able to save them from these endless black halls.*

Nat chews her lip, her eyes flick from side to side, thinking. She was given Radford for a reason, the only Christian in the group, and it took a little while to convince her that, no, this wasn’t  blasphemy. She’s looking thinner than I remember, though, her skin tight over her bones, and every now and again when she takes a sip of her drink she winces, as if it hurts.

She wears a headscarf, and I can’t help but imagine it as a sort of nuns habit, a nun who perhaps wanted people to know she liked to party.

*Crest paces the halls too, so used to having all eyes fixed on her, on the shifting colour of her skin, the dulcet tones of her voice, the curved and shimmering horns that burst from her forehead. But this is new - she knows she is alone, but she has never so keenly felt eyes on her like this, as if these silent and whispering eyes can see right through her, through the shifting facade she puts up and into the soul beneath.*

J smiles, enjoying the freedom of this new character, this skin he shares and watches. He makes a joke, and I watch how he waits for the laughter, straining.

There’s a moment of silence afterwards as they realise that the next description, the one I omit, would have been for Caleb’s character: Hush. They realise too, then, that this character who was perfect for Caleb, the misunderstood Goblin, the Fourth Hero, is now wandering those same halls, lonely and afraid, calling out for friends who will never hear him.

Nat breaks the silence.

*Radford calls out, his voice hoarse with fear. He asks who goes there, who is walking these same halls and whether they are friend or foe. The three meet, exchange theories about why they came here and why they have no recollection of it. Crest jokes that perhaps they’re ghosts, and Radford shivers: you’d do well not to joke of such things. Not here, at least.*

*As they argue, a sound rattles along the walls, a nervous, skittering sound.*

J looks up, raises his eyebrows.

*They freeze. Oxmourne tries to illuminate more of the hallway, to see what it is that is coming their way and it is then that they remember the SICK PRINCE, the stories they were told as children.*

Before I continue Oxmourne draws a CONDITION CARD from the deck.

It says only one thing: HE CAN SEE YOU.

*The SICK PRINCE on his throne of rot,*

*Of teeth and blood and tendons knot,*

*Who watches now and watches then,*

*Who’ll watch you all until the end.*

I sing the rhyme slightly, that half-melody that accompanies any rendition of a nursery rhyme, and I’m surprised that by the time I’ve finished they’ve all joined in, even just a little, humming a wordless version to themselves.

*They make their way through the THRONE ROOM, and upon investigating can see that the black and cursed throne upon which the SICK PRINCE resides seems to wait for him, empty, shifting in the shadows. The cold air licks at their exposed skin.*

*Radford shivers, despite himself he thumbs the holy symbol under his tunic.*

*But, Oxmourne speaks slowly, that means that he’s somewhere here, right? That the SICK PRINCE is wandering the halls as we speak. He notices something in the dust and is about to speak when-*

There’s a knock at the door.

At least, I think so. I notice Slade perk up as well. They run a hand over their shaved head, speak up.

Is that someone at the door?

Nat rolls her eyes.

No, dude, no ones at the door.

Her words say one thing but her tone carries the real message: the disdain for the junkie paranoia. The twitching mind of the addict, turning to everything but the most important. She hated the way Slade acted after Caleb passed, the synthetic blanket she used to smother herself. Thought it was cheating.

We’re quiet, and then J says: no, they’re right. Someone’s outside.

We don’t speak, and can hear it now, the slow and steady shuffle of someone outside, slowly walking round the walls of the house, and, I swear to God, mumbling something.

Go see who it is.

I shake my head. No, it’s a neighbour. Or something. I can’t go outside every time someone walks past the house.

But there’s fear in our silence, in the way we lean a little closer in to the table, the way J shifts his chair slightly so he’s closer to the rest of us. We’re scared, sure, but I’d bet that none of us can really say *why.*

I try to distract everyone. Continue with the game.

*Footsteps echo from a branch of THE FIFTH CASTLE you’ve left unexplored, shambling. Oxmourne shivers, turns himself into a cat and presses himself into the corner of the room. Crest blends into the wall, holding their breath, and all Radford can do is quietly stalk in the opposite direction, biting their tongue so hard they can taste blood.*

*THE SICK PRINCE draws closer: they can feel it, in the manic whispers that seem to crawl along the walls, in the sense of some intelligence throbbing under the stone, and the way each doorway only promises more of the same: more madness, more darkness.*

I mention to Nat that she needs to take a MINOR EVENT card as her solution was the least effective. She huffs, draws one, and goes silent. Something’s different about her, since we last met, I’m sure of it. Some hollowness, some detachment: present in the way she seems to have sunk into her bones, and the fact that a cross no longer hangs around her neck.

What is it?

She puts a hand to her head scarf, chews her lip.

I’ve inhaled one of the SICK PRINCE’s spores.

*Radford begins to cough, a thick, viscous black liquid. A black liquid that slowly, slowly, begins to fill his lungs.*

She looks to me: what the fuck?

I shuffled them. I promise.

She doesn’t seem convinced.

*They continue to move through the halls, quieter now, checking behind them at every turn.*

I’ve informed them that at this stage in the game the path of the SICK PRINCE is decided randomly, and that I’m plotting it in secret. I do not have to say it out loud, the fact hangs above them like smoke: nothing good can come if they cross him.

Slade’s leg begins to shake.

Whoever is outside is humming something now, just barely loud enough for us to hear, a melody that seems so familiar, that can only be-

*Crest is growing tired of it, begins to break into a jog.*

*They pick their way towards where they feel the GREAT DOORS are, following a map they found half-drawn in dust in the THRONE ROOM. Oxmourne has to return to human form, but there’s a reluctance there, a sense that in that moment, as a beast, he was perhaps happier than as a half-man.*

The fear doesn’t just exist in the game, it slowly seeps into real life too: upon entering a room that’s empty or hearing a creak or a wail from a long corridor they seize up in fear, as if the SICK PRINCE could somehow climb his way from the world of the game into our own.

A noise upstairs. Something shifting in the attic. A moment, then the sound again, a broken rhythm.

It’s an old house, I say.

They don’t seem convinced.

*They reach the stairs, manage to make their way to the Great Doors, huge and wooden and engraved with ancient runes-*

I pause them. This is a KEY EVENT, and as such I have to draw a random KEY EVENT CARD from the EVENT CARD DECK.

I make a show of shuffling it, let J split it and then we pick the top card.

I frown.

It’s for Hush, I say.

Slade blinks.

You told us you removed the Hush cards.

I did.

A pause.

*I did.*

And I feel my pulse quicken because I know I did, because I made sure of it, checking the deck one by one, card by card, to make extra sure that any reference to Hush was gone, to ensure that this exact situation didn’t happen. I’d been *so* careful.

I had, for a moment, a vision of Caleb’s face, his voice that night on the phone, slurred, telling me there was something wrong, that this wasn’t how it was meant to happen, that he couldn’t leave his apartment because whenever he stared into the hall it stretched long and black and empty in front of him like a tomb.

Nat says let’s open it, let’s just see what it would be, maybe we can imagine Hush is right there, and that-

J interrupts. No, he says, that’s fucked. We know he would have been Hush and it’s just fucked - playing his character even though he’s not here, even though he’s-

He can’t say it.

Nat: dead, you mean?

We all look at the table, let the moment hang in the air.

Slade itches below their jaw, shifts in their chair. Sure, they say, fine. Let’s just see what the card says. It’s part of the game, right?

EVENT CARD, GREAT DOORS: *As you rush into the Entrance Hall, and desperately try and heave the bolt from its place a flash of lightning illuminates the room behind you, and in that moment you are able to see slumped against the wall behind you, the small corpse of a Goblin - Hush - his wrists slit and blood so red it’s almost black pooling on the floor beneath him.*

Silence. Memories of Caleb.

I have to finish the card.

*And as you all stand, open-mouthed, heaving, you hear something echo through the whole CASTLE.*

*Someone is knocking on the GREAT DOORS. From the other side.*

Slade looks at me, shakes their head, lights another cigarette.

I have to clarify I didn’t write it, that these cards are random and the rules make it clear not all of the FOUR will always make it out of THE FIFTH CASTLE, but they’re telling me I rigged it, that this is a sick fucking game, that if this is what TROLLS & TOMBS really is they want nothing to do with it, not now, not ever.

Nat is crying now, looking up and using her index finger to wipe her tears, and J is shouting at me, saying that this was a dumb idea, and that look, it happened, and nothing will be the same, and we should just stop fucking pretending like it might be. Slade’s smoking the cigarette right until the very end, until it’s nothing but paper and filter.

They all leave in silence, Slade makes a call in my toilet, and I sit for a while at the empty table. I feel like a failure, and part of me hurts so much I have to close my eyes and rest my forehead against the cool woodgrain. I was trying so hard to make it work for him - for Caleb - who I know wanted this so badly. The people he loved together one last time.

I don’t sleep well that night, unable to get the melody of the SICK PRINCE’s song from my head, imagining myself lost in THE FIFTH CASTLE’s walls, cold, alone.

When I wake I have three new voicemails.

Slade, J, Nat.

They tell me that they want to play again, as soon as possible, that they had this dream that felt so vivid it was like it was real.

And, without having talked to eachother, they each relay the same dream.

The same dream with the same ending: facing the GREAT DOORS, hearing that knock.

And then, a detail that wasn’t present in the game.

They claim they heard a voice on the other side:

Caleb’s [voice.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Max_Voynich/)

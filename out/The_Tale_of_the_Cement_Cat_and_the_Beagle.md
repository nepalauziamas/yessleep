I have a Beagle, she's gonna turn 5 or 6 this August.  There was an old man that lived in our house before us, and he chain-smoked for 20 years to cope with his Wife passing on.  He loved to paint things and carve statues.  A few years ago he sold us, who were looking to move out of our cockroach-infested apartment (cockroaches were from another resident, they wouldn't do anything about it, that's a whole other story), his house and moved into the small apartments across the road.  He was technically downgrading, so he had 1800 Junk come and pick up a bunch of stuff, but we could pick some stuff to keep.  

I kept a statue of a Beagle and a newborn Kitten cuddling, we kept a fairly nice wooden Coffee Table, ETC.  Something that we chose to keep in my room, which is the biggest but it's upstairs so it gets swelteringly hot, was a door frame decoration.  It was a cat, it was attached to the top right of the doorframe of my closet and its tail drooped partially down the side.  It was a gray tabby cat, and it was a pretty well-carved sculpture, except its eyes were straight from uncanny valley.  They were halfway between the slits of cat eyes, and the massive, bulging, following nature of Baby Doll Eyes.  Another important detail is that my room has a secondary "closet."

That "closet" was actually a space used in the construction of the house, but, we're unsure if the old resident or the construction workers did it, but they put wood paneling on it. attached a door to the right of the top of my stairs, and sealed it off from the attic, which isn't really an attic since it's just insulation and anything above the weight of a squirrel would fall right through it.  We used to use it for storage but my mom now grows mushrooms in it since it rarely ever gets opened and it's dark enough.  The cat sat on the doorframe of my closet, though.  So one day, I very vaguely remember being too scared to open my eyes the last night.

Then, as I was on my computer, my Beagle had come up the stairs to give me a visit since I'd been gaming for hours.  As I walked over to her (at the top of the stairs) she started barking in my direction.  She wasn't barking at the utility closet, which would've been the logical place for a person to hide at the time seeing as there was a bunch of stuff they could hide behind in there, she was barking at MY closet.  I ran downstairs, my dog still barking, and told my parents that my Dog was barking at my closet.  My dad, armed with a Wireless Vacuum, crept upstairs and opened my closet door as my dog cowered and barked.

It was deserted, except for maybe a few spiders in the armor I made myself out of boxes a while back.

Then, we noticed something we had overlooked.  We assumed my dog partially barking upwards was just because she was partially howling, but we noticed she was looking at that GOD DAMN CEMENT CAT.  We got rid of it not long after.  Innocent ending, my dog didn't like that Cement Cat's eyes, saw it, and barked at it

right?

Well, it is a bit strange that my dog never looked up far enough to see it, especially while going up the stairs at an angle.  If she did see it, was she just fine with it until that one moment?  I don't know, but that cat, that cat was something else.  I outright DID NOT like it.  Even if you don't believe in spiritual heeby-jeeby stuff, I like to think that I'm spiritually sensitive.  This fact is backed up by things such as seeing my Grandma's friendly ghost in the corner of her guest bedroom in her old house when I was really little, then something happened that I can actually remember.  After she had moved out of her house and into the trailer she lives in now, she turned her guest bedroom into a playroom for me.

I vaguely remember it was almost like my eyes embodied when you're somewhere too quiet and your ears start ringing and hearing weird noises, thick purple transparent-ish lines appeared to draw cartoony flowers, then an imperfect triangle around them, then arms, then a head and legs started as I ran down the hall to my Grandma in the living room so fast.  This cat, while it didn't trigger any weird shit like that, gave me the same feeling I had when that happened.  It's following gaze filled me with dread more than any even creepier stuffed animal.  Also, it didn't follow my vision, it stayed in that one corner of the room.  Somehow, despite it being indistinct and blurry, I thought it was a woman in a flowery dress.   My Grandma saged her trailer later that day.

So, do you think it's just a paranoid dog and hillbilly stuff or something strange was actually going on.

“Anaye!”,” Go Get Your brother!” my mother said as my brother ran into the woods. For some reason, there had always been some sort of rules that my family had put in place since we've been there(which was our entire lives) and she made me carry the list of rules if I got lost. I followed him into the woods. But as I got into the forest I lost him I tried calling out to him” Nathan!” Nathan!” I screamed over and over getting louder each time but I started to get worried so I tried to run back and get help but no luck I could only think to myself “holy shit” “I didn't even go that far I only took a couple of steps out into the forest” then I paced around and then I thought “ holy shit, the list!'' I reached into the pocket of my jacket and found it, the list.

1. Don't lose sight of the house while you are in the forest

“why the fuck did you not tell me that earlier mom?”

2. If you do be calm just wait the day out there is a door back to the normal world from 2:30-2:59 am don't risk taking the journey if it is too late 

3. Focus on getting shelter before trying to escape because the forest changes at night 

4. if you hear a voice or see something that you recognize don't trust it

5. If you see antlers, run, fuck your shelter RUN.

What the fuck is the normal world. And if I'm not there then where am I? I Never paid attention to the rules because I thought they were complete bullshit but now I need to follow them or else I could die? I already broke the first rule. So I try to find somewhere to hide and I see a cave it's risky but I see a cave and I sleep in there for the first night as I settle in there I wake up to blood covering the floor my watch says it is 7:23 am inside the caves are drawing carved in with sticks like the things you'd expect cavemen to draw depicted a monster skinny, 9 feet tall with long claws and…” are those antlers” I said probably a little too loud I decided tonight was enough and I planned to make a run for it. I remembered the reason I was here in the first place. “That little shit,” I thought to myself but immediately after I heard ruffling in the woods. It was my dog. I was about to go run and get her but I remembered rule 4. I stopped dead in my tracks. It was my brother, none of this. I checked the time 3:01 am this is the shit my mom wanted me to avoid by escaping but I missed the first window I had a chance to get. I waited the night out in my cave luckily no one or nothing found me in here and if they did id be everything but alive, what is a 14-year-old girl going to do against whatever the fuck this is.

	

It's 1:59 right now and I'm ready to go. But I figured it would be best to see where the opening opens up. It opened up near a heart-shaped tree. I was about to make a run for it but “fuck” they're they were, the antlers. You're goddamn right I ran, just in the other direction and now I needed another place to hide. I saw my brother, I had to hide. It looked so much like him but I couldn't trust it. I still couldn't tell if that was my real brother. I was looking around and I saw the thing, well its shadow at least. It was so tall. I mean I knew it was tall but holy shit. “Am I gonna”, “am gonna die a virgin ” I thought.

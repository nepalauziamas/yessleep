I glanced over at the digital read out on the clock near the computer at the security desk. It read 00:41. About 20 minutes to go until the straggling students would have to vacate the library and I would be left to my own devices for three hours. I scoured the paper, reading and re-reading the rules. I had already violated #7, but even though that experience was certainly jarring, it didn't appear to have created any lasting damage. I surveyed the Government Original Document section at length and couldn't find any semblance of a clue that a man had just committed suicide. Maybe the author of the letter *intended* for me to start off my shift with an infraction. It definitely got my attention, and didn't really cause any  harm. Well, okay obviously I was still a little fucked up from watching that horrific sequence, but my prolonged search for any sign of the interaction yielding no results had allowed me to calm down somewhat. My thoughts were interrupted by a shocking chime coming through the PA system.

*da-ding!*

"Attention library patrons, the library will be closing in ten minutes. The library will be closing in ten minutes. Please make your final selections and exit the library. Have a good night." 

&#x200B;

The last few students that were holed up in the third floor study area walked down the stairs, past me and out the door. 

&#x200B;

"Have a splendid evening my good man! I do apologize for my belligerence earlier, 'twas not intended to be an assault on your character. You seem like a sublime chap!" The Chinese exchange student from my previous encounter said as he tipped his top hat and exited through the main set of door with his compatriots. *Fuck that was eloquent*. With the hold-outs having all trickled out from the massive interior of the library, I was all alone in the gargantuan building. Or so I hoped. I took a shaky breath and walked away from the desk to begin my first perimeter sweep of the library. I started in the basement.

&#x200B;

The basement has a network of corridors that are not utilized by the student body or the general public, and are mostly only frequented by library staff. These hallways compose a pretty complex labyrinth of pathways that I certainly hadn't mastered yet. The hallways had sharp, biting angles, and accordingly had hallway safety mirrors in the upper corner of the ceiling. I know that they had saved me from bumping into another staff member who was coming the opposite direction a few times earlier that evening. I approached the first sharp turn in the network of hallways and my eyes instinctually gravitated upwards. The advice of the letter came back to me just in time- *Rule #1:* ***Never*** *look at the hallway safety mirrors in the basement corridor. Keep your eyes low and walk swiftly.* 

&#x200B;

I averted my eyes back down to the floor and turned the corner briskly. The coast was clear. *No big deal* I thought. I continued walking deeper into the heart of the basement. Some important background information about the composition of the basement is that most library staff members will never actually lay eyes on the majority of the floor. The staff hallways exist on the periphery of a massive area that is closed off to everyone but the most privileged security personnel. This portion of the basement belonged to the State Historical Society, and was well fortified. No one that I knew had ever actually entered into that portion of the basement. I had just finished my perimeter sweep of the basement and was beginning to turn around to return to the stairs near the security desk when I heard deep and ragged breaths coming from around the corner.

&#x200B;

"**HELLO??"** I shouted out reflexively. There was no response, just the continuation of the deep and uneven breaths. I was stuck. I had to walk past that hallway to get out of the maze of corridors that I had embedded myself in. The temptation to just look up at the mirror that I knew was conveniently located at the turn in the hallway was immense. Why encounter the unknown and potentially dangerous without having any idea of what it is you're about to confront? If I looked at the mirror I would know what the source of that horrid breathing was without having to face it head on. And it definitely wasn't moving, I had heard no sound of approach and the breathing sounded just as loud as it had been when I first heard it. But I had made a promise to myself to adhere to the rules, and I had already seen the result of disobeying these guidelines firsthand. I took a deep breath and careened around the corner, eyes shut and head down. 

&#x200B;

I stood there for a moment, afraid to raise my gaze. As I did, I saw the hallway in its entirety, nothing amiss. Whatever had made those noises wasn't in this stretch of hallway anymore. *Theres one point for the "follow the rules" approach* I thought. Hastily I made my way back to the stairs and ascended to the second floor, anxious to leave the cramped quarters of those damned hallways behind me. My sweep of the second floor was much less exciting and I completed it without incident in about 20 minutes. I walked up to the third floor, and aside from a bat flying over my head and scaring the piss out of me, that too was uneventful. I was getting ready to embark on the stairs up to the fourth floor when I heard the sound of the library main doors opening two floors below. 

&#x200B;

Those doors had been locked for nearly an hour now, it made no sense that they could be opened from the exterior. Hesitantly I inched my way down the stairs, staying alert for any indication that someone could be inside the library. When I turned the corner on the stairs to walk down the last flight of stairs that opened up into the atrium, I was shocked to see two gray poles at the foot of the stairs. *What the fuck?* I thought. And then my blood ran cold with a realization: those weren't poles at all. They were legs. Long, slender legs. In all, from my perch at the top of the flight of stairs I could see up to about chest height of whatever monstrosity was standing at the bottom of the staircase. I recoiled instinctively, backing into the wall. In a deep baritone that vibrated my bones, the man spoke. 

&#x200B;

"**I know that you are up there**," the voice said. My breath caught in my throat and I stood as still as I could. The man spoke quietly, but the immense depth of his voice rumbled through the air like a clap of thunder. 

&#x200B;

"**Are you afraid?**" The man asked. Remembering the advice from the rules- a*nswer any question he asks you with "no sir" and he will go away-* I squeaked out "no sir."

&#x200B;

"**Then you're fucking stupid. Are you fucking stupid?**" The voice had taken on a menacing tone, booming in the small staircase.

&#x200B;

"No sir." I said, as confidently as I could. 

&#x200B;

"**Would you like to see my face?**" The man asked. 

&#x200B;

"No sir." I replied. 

&#x200B;

The man stood motionless for a few more moments, blood had begun to stain the upper reaches of his visible clothing, turning his gray suit a deep crimson. I watched thick, wet drops roll off of his sleeves and past his long, bony fingers as they plopped onto the linoleum. A few more seconds went by and the man abruptly turned around and strolled away from the stairs. I checked my watch. 3:03 AM.

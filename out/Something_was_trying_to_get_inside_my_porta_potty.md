Alright. So to get this out of the way, this is fully real. This is a story but this isn't fiction. I haven't told a soul and everyone nearby in a few hundred meter distance hadn't a clue except one guy. You can ask question I can answer what I know. But I was so scared for my life.

I'm 13. My parents send me off to an overnight camp for a week at a place up in the woods. 

We had a game near the end of the day which you go around the whole camp which is really big and it's like a massive tag where you get to these checkpoints around the camp. 

So I was with my group and split off to speed run all these checkpoints as they give you points for your team. And then the fun began.

I needed to take a shit. Like I had drank a full orange crush can of pop and my teen body couldn't handle it. No one was near me. It was in the middle of the woods. It was the furthest point of camp and it was in the middle of two widely spread out checkpoints. I should've went to the central bathroom but I had to go badly.

So I go into this small porta potty that has a lock that can be opened from the outside and it doesn't smell that bad.

So I'm farting away and shitting and cleaning up when I hear walking. Scuffling. Sniffing the kind a bear would. But the part that made me literally shit was it started trying to unlock the door. 

I firmly had my hand holding it for my life. The creature continues on to around the portal potty. It scratches at the thing but the wall is pretty thick. You can hear it making almost bear growls(?) but a bear can't unlock the door and as far as it is there almost never are bears(only one recorded in decades near camp as they are normally scared of humans).

I think maybe it's one of my buddies playing with me. Maybe he was watching me form far and wanted to prank me. So I call out "not funny bro" and I realised I messed up.

The thing tries more desperately now it knows I'm inside. It tries for the door one more time knowing it almost opened but I hold it firmly. Then it climbs on top of the Portapotty.

This Portapotty is high. I'm like 5'4 and this Portapotty can fit a fucking NBA player. So this creature is now on-top of the Portapotty or at least it's hands are. There are little dotted holes in the Portapotty but I can see anything as there's only a few at the worst spots. Though I can hear it snifing me out from the outside.

10 minutes goes by with it circling, scratching and sniffing my portapotty when I finally hear it walk away. I'm shivering. 

I though that was the end of my life. This camp is like a 20 minute drive from my cottage up north. Few weeks pass and there's bear sightings apparently nearby the cottage. 

I don't know if it's a bear, a kid pranking me, or something else. But I don't know because it could climb uptop my portapotty and I heard the inaugural sniffing. 

Thanks for listening to my story. If you guys want more info I love in Ontario and my cottage is near Muskoka. We get only brown bears near me. Almost no wolves but occasionally deer, foxes and racoons.

There are a number of problems with the apartments on Scenic Avenue, just a few hundred yards down the coast from the south Endcreek commercial district. The commercial district itself contained mostly outdated souvenir shops and was dotted with restaurants like Potlick, Dim-Sum-More, or Frank’s. Further north-west up the coast is where you’d find the fish-packing plant, the Berkshire place that employed a healthy percentage of Endcreek residents. The apartments, whenever I’d looked over the brochure for them, sold the place as a scenic-long-stay-vacation thing. In all actuality, it smelled of fish, the saltwater chapped my poor bleeding lips, and the apartments themselves were not insulated properly for a property so close to the ocean.

I’d been hired more than a decade ago at The Paper. That’s the name of the slowly dying news outlet further inland where us handful of journalists struggle to think of original headers for small-town news stories; [there was that deal about the bodies going missing not too long ago that gave us something to talk about](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/s6wa08/the_bodies_dont_stay_buried_in_endcreek/). But like a candle wick, all good stories fade into darkness—no matter how sensational they might have been at one point or another.

My memories of initially coming to Endcreek, fresh-faced from Suffolk and hoping to settle among its denizens was quickly swept away. Although quaint, unassuming, and overall calming, Endcreek has a creep like any other small place in America; it gets its hooks in you and never lets you go. Hooks. Must be why the fishing business does so well in these parts. What I mean to say is this: it first traps you with its idyllic nature with its sharp cliff faces which look out on the water, its birch trees, its superstitious residents, or its isolation. Quickly enough, however, it comes time that you are among those superstitious strangers, another chap-faced seaside dweller with little remaining semblance of the boisterous college kid you once were.

I never bought so much lip balm as my first year living here in Endcreek, what with the salt in the air, and now I’m addicted to the stuff to the point that I always have a fistful of the tubes planted somewhere within the recesses of my purse.

There are a number of problems with the apartments on Scenic Avenue, chiefly among them being that I live in one of the units and mold eats away at the ceilings, the floors, the food left in cupboards. I can’t stand it, and the woman that owns the Chinese place up the street, Dim-Sum-More, is also *supposed* to be our landlady, but acts more like a freaking tyrant. With little other recourse, I attempted to organize a rent-strike among the other tenants, but whenever I brought up the issue of mold, they balked, saying they’ve never had any issues with mold and furthermore, Mrs. Bēi'āi had always been fair with them. Well, I’d put up with her foolishness for long enough! I intended to have my issues fixed or I would look into suing her for negligence or something. There was the ever-present thought in my mind that I could, in less charitable words, conduct a hit-piece in The Paper. *That* would be immoral. I think.

It was late and mostly everyone had gone home. I’d just finished up a round of editing at work when my boss, Jessica Leighton, rounded my desk to take a look over my shoulder at the article I had pulled up on the desktop. Her breed was one of the old families of Endcreek with deep pockets, although she’d been accepted on the periphery as Jessica had married into the Leighton family sometime after my arrival in town. For the past two years, she’d made my life a living hell by pulling my articles, meticulously combing through my words until she’d catch a missed comma or em-dash. Without brains and with all the nepotism in the world, she’d been made the editor in chief at The Paper, and I was to acquiesce whichever way her whim dictated.

“Whatcha’ workin’ on?” she asked me. I could feel the exhale of her minty breath as she chewed gum in my ear.

My response was flat. “Just gearing up for my round of reporting on the yearly Winter Festival. You know how it is. The mayor likes his speeches, the sheriff’s department will lock up a few drunks, and I will inevitably not care about any of it.” I offered a glancing smile.

Her grimace was audible. “So, what’s this?” She pointed at the screen. “What’s all this?” she waved her hand in front of the screen as if to emphasize before I’d even had an opportunity to respond.

“A template I use each year. As long as it goes to plan, as it does every year, then we should have no problems. I can use this, make a few adjustments if anything piques my interest, and I can get home in time for an eggnog coma.”

“Don’t do that.” Her phone beeped and she pulled the screen up to her face; I could hear the clicks of her responding to a text. “Anyway, I’ve got to go.” She finally removed herself from my shoulder; the weight of her annoying presence had been like a perching gargoyle, and I was immediately glad for it to have been lifted. “I’ve got a date this evening. James is taking me to that dim-sum place or whatever it’s called. You know the one. I think you live near there.” She moved through the maze of desks without even looking over her shoulder. “You definitely should *not* be using templates for such a *big* event. Make it unique. Make it special.” The door to The Paper’s single-story office slammed shut and I was left alone amongst the sleeping computers, the water cooler, my single illuminated screen as evening marched on. I swiveled in my office chair, watched her leave the front steps through the large windows on the front of the building, and reached for the key fob in my pocket before I unlocked the bottom drawer of my desk and slid it open to expose a fifth of gin. I shut the drawer back with the bottle in my hand and went to stand at the window. Her Prius’s headlights splashed across the windows as she reversed from her parking spot then rounded her way out of the small asphalt rectangle. I moved to the coffee pot where the concoction within had been simmering since early noon and made myself a cup with more than one shot from the bottle of gin.

I redeposited myself at my desk, sipping from the coffee, and thinking of the developing mold in my apartment. There had to be something that could be done. If my wretched landlady refused do anything about it, maybe *I* could do something about it.

On my walk home it was pitch black except the stars and streetlights and I stumbled over the loosened sidewalk as my legs carried me from where the town stretched over the hills towards the sea on the town’s western half of shore. Normally, the walk would take me anywhere between fifteen to twenty minutes, but on this night, I kept laughing at the thought of what my boss’s sex life might be like. Whenever I saw the Leighton couple interact with one another in person, they treated themselves like celibate troll-dolls. For all I knew, they were celibate; it would explain the way Jessica pranced around the office in the daytime in her unfortunately tailored suit pants with her butt cheeks clenched like she was holding a broom (she acted like something that rhymed with witch anyway). Then I began to think of my own dating life. I’d intended to find some handsome seafaring man in one of the taverns off coastal Endcreek, but most of them made me uncomfortable or vice-versa. There goes the cliché over the lonely spinster, aging with every passing moment. That’s not entirely truthful though; sometimes I believe that if the choice of becoming entangled in romance wasn’t an ever-present force all around me, I’d care hardly at all. Look at the Leightons, unhappy as far as I can tell—is that sincerely what I’d want from it? I laughed at myself as I stumbled further. I took the road past the library, the cobbled one without cars that stood empty and lit by electric lanterns, and I found a bench for a moment to catch my breath; the cool autumn air took the wind from me and remaining steady on my feet was becoming a feat. 

I pulled my knitted cap around my ears, brushed the hair from my face, and rummaged in my purse to find the bottle of gin. With measuring what remained, I unscrewed the bottle and drank with it glinting in the lanternlight over my head. It burned and I returned it to its hiding place before adjusting in my seat and craning my neck over the back of the bench to gaze at the stars through the sparse leaves of an overhead birch. The Endcreek tourist board had petitioned to line the handful of downtown streets with those scrawny white trees. Sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, it was that I’d drink too heavily, and I’d stare up at the open sky through childish giddy eyes and remember the freedom, the reason I’d come to Endcreek to begin with. I reckon there is, in equal parts, love and hate in the hearts of most that dwell here. Perhaps a drunken thought and little else. Perhaps something more. I felt good and with the alcohol warming me, I pushed to my feet and haphazardly made my way down the slant on Main, toward where it met at Scenic Avenue where the saltwater kissed the air and waves lullabied the overnight dockworkers. It *did* feel right as I took across Scenic and shambled over the grass peninsula separating the apartment complex’s parking lot from the street. I passed the sign that displayed the complex’s name: Oceanside Gardens.

I felt a warm burp shift up my throat and caught it in my hand. My eyes burned and I futzed with my purse, spidering my hand through the junk stored therein to find my keyring. Once I’d found it, I angled through the exterior hall created by lined balcony walkways between compact units. I could, before even reaching the zippered stairs, overhear the young boys that lived in the unit across from me. The bass from their stereo reverberated through the metal on the stair’s handrail. I slogged towards my unit, 2C, ignoring what was probably the hottest, newest bop.

After stabbing my key into the door, I spilled into the dark apartment, took in the stagnant air, and briefly noticed the mold smell. Shedding my hat and coat, I hung them alongside my purse on the hooks by the door and rubbed the autumn chill from my fingers before feeling for the light switch. In the light, the half-kitchen, half-den seemed stark of luxuries except a bookcase and the mass-produced art hanging on the walls. I moved to the couch and clicked on the TV to catch the end of a rerun of Family Matters. From the position of where I sat on the couch, I could look out on my right to the sliding glass doors which remained chronically shut. There was a balcony out there, but I never saw the point. The water out there matched the blackness of the sky; only stars showed where the horizon might’ve been.

I fell to sleep with the vague idea that I should throw a frozen pizza in the oven.

\-

When I awoke, I did so with a stir; at some point during the night, I had entangled myself in one of the numerous throw blankets I kept folded on the back of the couch. The lights were still on, the TV was still going, and I sat there dumbly for a moment while staring into space. What time was it? I reached for my phone, and I saw that I had two missed calls from Mrs. Jessica Leighton and winced at her contact info displayed there on the screen. It was well and sunny outside and I’d slept heavy, right through my alarms. I quickly stood and felt dizzy before letting out a heavy cough, feeling tightness in my chest catch the breath somewhere unsatisfying.

Returning to sit on the couch, I rubbed my chest and tried taking in a deep breath but could never reach the comfort of full lungs. My eyes were sore, my arms and legs felt achy; the muscles were waking now, and I felt like reheated shit. It was no wonder I’d slept through the alarms, through the phone calls. I reached to call Leighton but thought again and moved to the bathroom off the single hallway leading near the bedroom. Examining my face in the mirror, my eyes stood shiny and the flesh around them were lightly swollen and red. I tried taking in another deep breath, this one was accompanied by a series of coughs that ended with me hocking a piece of phlegm into the sink basin. The gooey thing that’d come from me sat there, oozing in the direction of the drain, yellowish, greenish; I grimaced and twisted the hot water on to be rid of it. Had I caught a cold?

I pushed my hands under the running water and adjusted the temperature before placing my face under the nozzle. I held my hair back and scrubbed with my fingertips around my temples, around the tenderness behind my eyeballs. This wasn’t a hangover. It must’ve been because I’d been stupid in returning home at such a leisurely pace. I leaned in close on the sink and without any decency, snot rocketed my nostrils clean.

Lackadaisically, I sat on the rim of the bathtub and reached for my phone once more, this time surmising to shoot Leighton a quick text: **Feeling under the weather. I’ll be working from home today. Think it’s a cold. Should be in tomorrow though. Thanks.**

I ran myself a bath, extra bubbles, scolding hot, and dipped myself in, draping a wetted rag across my forehead. I figured the steam should do me some good. My phone dinged and I read the text from Leighton: **All’s good. Just worried about you!!! If you need anything, let us here at the office know!! Hope you feel better!!!**

She lived to annoy me, I think. It would’ve been something if she was at least the sort of boss I could openly quarrel with, but no! She needed to be the appealing sort, the mask wearing vulture, the gross pretender. Or I was bitter and jealous. Jealous of what?

I stared up at the drop ceiling over my cramped bathtub, letting my eyes wander and the phone slip from my out-hanging hand. Around the edges of a tile, I saw the weird creep of black mold. “Fuck.” The whisper fell just as my mouth plunged to the murky bathwater while I created bubble noises.

With the “day off” I thought I should probably focus on destroying the trespasser in the apartment. Just because Mrs. Bēi'āi intended to do nothing about it, didn’t mean that I would let the mold infect every inch of the place.

After the bath, I took some Advil and made some hot tea. Still in my bathrobe, with my hair wrapped, I moved to the cabinets beneath my kitchen sink, noticing yet more fuzzy growths around the pipes, and removed the cleaning supplies, but upon further strategizing, I grabbed a bottle of bleach from the broom closet near the entrance. The first spot I would tackle would be the bathroom, around the tiles of the drop ceiling. I made a mixture, two parts water to bleach in a spray bottle and awkwardly stood over the open mouth of the tub on its edges, using one hand to push the tile up so I could twist it to the backside, while using my free hand to keep my balance against the wall. The tile fell free, along with a hefty dusting of the mold; the stuff plumed in the air like a black atom bomb, exploding in my face as the tile clattered to the floor. Hacking in the dirty air, I slipped from my position over the tub and arranged myself on its edge, sitting in clutches of another coughing fit. My eyes watered, my lungs burned. The tile sat there mocking me and I had half a mind to break the thing in two.

Once I’d gathered myself, I angled the tile into the tub and sprayed it down; the whole back half of the tile was covered in the mold’s veiny structure, dusty, grimy, alive. Using a dish rag, I scrubbed it, unsure if my efforts were having any impact whatsoever. The mold came away in streaks, caking my fingernails and cloth. I gagged and hung my head over the toilet. The way it goes is that if one makes themselves gag and cough enough, they begin to throw up and I began to feel the burning sensation of that very thing in the back of my throat. It was miserable. Having a moment away from the tile, I looked around the room to see that a black cloud had gathered in the air, translucent spores pirouetted with every movement I made. In a moment of pure, raw stupidity—call it what you may—I clamped the rag I’d been using to clean the tile over my nose and mouth in hopes that it would deter the smoky mold. I breathed in and immediately regretted it.

In disgust at realizing what I’d done, I threw the rag and instead snatched the hem of my bathrobe to throw over my face. I feel it was too late though.

In a mad scurry, I clambered from the bathroom and slammed the door shut behind me. 

Inspecting myself in the camera of my phone, I saw my face powdered in black speckles. I washed my face in the kitchen and scrubbed my hands before removing my bathrobe.

The coughing turned to hysterical laughter at my predicament. What monster had I unleashed? I should’ve moved. I should’ve chided the other tenants more. I should’ve done lots of things differently.

In a pair of lounge pants and a T-shirt, I decided to try and put something on my upset stomach. It was sometime around noon that I was able to somewhat catch my breath. Sitting on the couch, I nibbled around the edges of saltines, drank ginger ale, watched the news in a dreary haze of sickness. There were a few minutes I spent trying to get some work-work done. I had removed my weathered laptop from the bedroom, passing the closed bathroom door while doing so, and tried sitting the device beside me on the couch with its screen open in hopes that it might distract me.

It must’ve been sometime around two o’clock in the afternoon that I decided to leave the house; removing myself from the apartment for some fresh air might do some good. After poking my head from my door to gauge the weather, I decided on a heavy coat, another layer of lounge pants, a wool hat, and a scarf. It wasn’t really the weather for it with the sun out in full force, but my whole body was shivering. Like it was wilting. Like I was being eaten up—impossible.

The young men across the hall were standing in the open stairwell, passing a cigarette back and forth. Pulling my hat tightly across my brow, I hoped they would ignore me, but one of them, the skinnier of the two, piped up, “Hey, lady, hope the music didn’t bother you last night.”

I simply shook my head and tucked my head down, hoping to slip down the stairs without further engaging. My tongue felt wrong in my mouth, swollen or something.

The other young man muttered under his breath, “What’s her problem?”

“Nothing!” I squeaked. Taking the stairs quickly, urgently, I felt dizzy and one quick inhale of air, I felt the tickle in the back of my throat as I fully engulfed myself in the cool air. The coughing came and once I reached the ground level of the stairs, I held onto the handrail for dear life, giving it pulsing squeezes that beat with every sharp needling inhale. That’s what it felt like. Needles sharp and deadly in my chest, giving me a thousand point poke every time I dared breath too deeply. Catching my breath, if only a little, I walked with a wild gait, stuffing my hands under my armpits, trying to calm myself down.

I fluttered my eyes, half closed in blinks as I moved across the parking lot onto the sidewalk, focusing on the sound of the rushing waves against the shore; a seagull called out loud and abrupt. Without a specific place in mind, I wandered further down the sidewalk nearer the commercial district, closer to the neon signs of a dive bar that was quickly arriving on my right. From within I could hear the distinct musical stylings of Jimmy Buffet; I’d been in there before. The place was called Fly Paper—clever name, but the thought of flies made me feel sick again. Perhaps flies were buzzing around in my chest, clinging to the mucus in my respiratory system, rubbing their eyelash hands together in an effort to tickle my esophagus. I coughed so hard that I belched and fell into the wall of the bar, hard red bricks held me up and I slid my back into a squatting position, knees parted wide for what came. Vomit fell out from mouth and for dizzying minutes, I felt a sudden relief like I could catch my breath.

Wiping my eyes and the dribble that came from my mouth, I bolted into a standing position, aghast at was lay there on the sidewalk in front of my shoes. The concoction I’d purged stayed congealed, yellow infection mixed with something else, a black goo—surely a mixture of the mold I’d inhaled. If I’d not already emptied my stomach, I might’ve done it again.

At that moment, I heard another seagull call from somewhere overhead; my eyes caught it as it crested the overhang of the building. The bird moved in a spiral dive to land in front of me. Curiously, head bobbing forward as its feet met land, it moved in closer to the thing I’d thrown up, beak outstretched. In a flash, the seagull clamped a beak around the goo, it hung together in wet strands so thick like hair. A wheezing sound came from the bird as though it was trying to call out; as the creature inhaled, the goo disappeared into its beak wetly, residual infection caked around the bevels of its mouth. It cocked its head, tried to let out a call and instead what came from its clogged neck was a chuffing sound as though it was suffocating. The poor thing seemed to panic, dart its head in all directions, and even tried to dislodge the thing through more restrained calls. It hobbled on its feet into the road and waved its wings till it took flight. I watched it disappear somewhere inland.

Rubbing my throat, I felt soreness the same way bruises are warm.

Seconds stretched as I appreciated being able to breathe. Popping the relative silence was Margaritaville spilling out onto the street; it was getting to the part of the song where there’s a woman to blame. A man, wiry-bearded, standing tall and partially handsome with deep crow’s feet swaggered onto the street. The man wore a blue chambray work shirt. He lit the half-finished cigarillo dangling from his lips and the air was quickly filled with the awful smell of the thing. Something fruity maybe. Seemingly, he noticed me, turning to face me there on the sidewalk full-on; there was a crystalline glint in his beard like he’d spilled whatever he was drinking down the front of himself. “Hey there! How are you doing there, young lady?”

“Young lady?” I hadn’t been young for what felt like a long time.

“Sure. Just as I’m a young man,” he laughed. It was then that I noticed the gray cropping around his ears. “Anyway. This is a nice town you guys have here. There’s a rowdy bunch in there,” he motioned to the wide anterior window of the bar, all glass with green blinds hiding most of the goings-on of the patrons. “Hah!” He checked the watch on his wrist, “And it’s not even two.” The man moved in for a handshake.

Without thinking, I recoiled. When I saw the offense on his face, I responded, “I think I have a cold.”

“Well,” he wiped the hand he’d offered to me down the front of his jeans like that’s what he’d intended to do with it the whole time before continuing, “That’s alright. I hope you get better.” He took a hefty puff from the cigarillo. “My name’s Ed. You?”

“Emily.”

“Nice to meet you.” Ed took a quick look at his phone before nodding at me as if to let me know that he needed to accept a call. Placing the phone up to his ear, he bellowed, “Hey there, Jeff! How’s the crab?”

With him distracted and me not waiting to exchange further pleasantries, I darted away; it took no time at all in the spell of the brisk walk back to the apartment for the tightening of my chest to begin again and I hoped it was nothing more than a false alarm. I should’ve scheduled an appointment with Dr. Lazlo; he’d been the doctor that’d helped me when I’d had that rash the previous summer.

Returning to the apartment, the two young men from before were gone and I reentered my apartment only to be blasted by the stink of death, by rot, by scabby tastes in the stagnant air. The apartment was dark as evening.

Both hot around the neck of my coat and cold on my extremities, I flipped the light switch on to be greeted by black smoke—not smoke—it was mold in the air. Without thinking, I shut the door behind me. Thick white fuzz clung to black hairy clumps that danced like dust sprites. A determined spirit overcame me. In a moment, I coiled my scarf around my face, and barreled through the mess of airborne mold. My shin met the coffee table and I let out a shriek followed up with a quick inhale—thick like water but worse.

Moving helter-skelter, totally panicked, panicked like the seagull, I latched onto the handle of the sliding glass door leading out onto the balcony and shoved it open, laying all of my weight against it. When the metal frame clattered on the far end, a gust of ocean wind carried the bulk of the furry dust, and I heard the distinct sound of the glass splintering beneath my movements; not that I needed to worry about getting my deposit back at this point.

I fell onto the overhang and clamped the scarf over my face again, barely peering from between the spaces in my fingers, watching the avalanche of what looked like smog blotting out the sky. I screamed. I screamed as much as any person muffling their mouth could scream; my voice came out in ghoulish moans. 

Then came the coughing. Hard, quaking, rattling, rasping. Blood shot onto my scarf and it took me a moment to realize that It’d come from my own mouth. I tasted it but couldn’t smell it. I could smell nothing besides the rank wet rot of the mold while it ravaged the clean outside air. It was thick and seemed to never end. Bringing my legs underneath me, I sat on the balcony floor, my back to the tall window, while watching the black bellow from my apartment doorway like factory smoke down the coast, catching the sea winds and gliding somewhere unseen.

Try as I might, I could not hold my breath for long and soon enough I hissed shallow intakes of air in preparation for what I may do next.

Briefly, I pulled the scarf from around my mouth. “Hel—” I cried out; the word shot from lips, cut short as mold entered between my teeth, forcing a gag from me. It was like wet hair and clung to my tongue. I am not happy to say that I explored its texture in an effort to scrape it from the roof of my mouth. Vomit, unabashed vomit spilled down the front of my coat; there shouldn’t have been anything for me to empty. It should’ve been bile. Instead, infected goo bubbled down my bottom lips, hanging in webby strands much in the same way it had with the seagull earlier. I latched onto thick goo with pinched fingernails and tugged, feeling a hard ball of something dislodge in the back of my throat. Pulling on the ropey mass, I felt something coming from deep in my chest. With tears welling in my eyes, I yanked while my whole body tensed in preparation for what came next. A hard mass scraped my teeth on its escape and fell onto the balcony at my feet. Yellow and black and with bits of wetted white hair, it rolled like a marble searching for level ground. Following close behind was an abrupt projectile of blood; it felt more like an involuntary gleet only with the pressure of a water hose.

Shaking, wiping the tears from my face, I wrapped the scarf around my face again. Once I’d gathered my bearings, I saw the mold smoke had dissipated—it seemed that all that intended to come from the recesses of my apartment had come and I was left alone on the balcony. Still, the sharpness in my chest remained.

Using the long end of my scarf like a tissue, I lifted the ball that’d fallen from inside me and pulled it closer to my face. The texture was unmistakably fungus, only more muscular. Perhaps like injured skin that becomes inflamed and hardens with swollen blood. I shivered, feeling the thing pulse through the knit in the scarf.

While pulling myself to my feet, using the balcony guardrail for leverage, I peered out onto the coast, searching for the wild spores in hopes of seeing where they’d gone. Then, without wanting to, I pivoted and looked into the darkened open mouth of my apartment. If one were mistaken, they might think it was shadow, but the lingering dust particles were alive and when I stepped inside, I could feel the room was breathing all around me.

Placing the hard ball on the coffee table—I had to scrape the edges from clinging to my scarf—I felt in my pocket, retrieving my phone.

“Endcreek Sheriff’s Office, what can I do you for?”

I could scarcely speak; it’s hard to do so while trying not to breathe. “I’m scared.” I hadn’t known that’s what I intended to say when initially dialing the police, but the words came all the same. My tone was scratchy, bruised, unrecognizable.

“Excuse me, sir? Are you in trouble?” asked the dispatcher.

“It’s everywhere. I can’t even see my floors.” My voice was a tortured whisper. I moved through the apartment, past the small kitchen area in a hazy black fog. In the swallowing darkness, I could hardly see the doorhandle leading out into the stairwell.

“I’m sorry. I can barely hear you. Are you in danger?” I’m certain the dispatcher did not intend for the growing worry to be so evident in their voice.

I reached out with the scarf sleeve and felt around for the doorhandle that would allow me to exit the apartment. The spaces around the frame were crusted over in scabby mold, but giving it a hard tug, it tore away like matted hair. “Help me,” I finally managed loud enough to register.

I slammed the door shut behind me, catching the afternoon sunbeams in the open stairwell. Without thinking, I moved to the far rails that looked out on the rocky coast then slid against them until I sat with my legs folded in on themselves.

The dispatcher was talking. “Are you there? Hello? Please stay on the line with me. I’m going to have a deputy come out to your location.”

“Oceanside Gardens!” I screamed into the receiver; immediately my hand shot to my throat to massage it.

“Okay. Just stay calm. A deputy is on their way. Hang tight. Are you in immediate danger? Have you sustained any injuries?”

“I don’t know.” I felt delirious, the initial horror melted away. Perhaps it *was* delirium. Perhaps it was. I caught a sniff of the blood around my scarf and discarded this thought; the mold too was heavy on me. The terror crept in and out like ocean waves in rhythm with the tide I could hear from where I sat.

I gathered my thoughts and tried speaking with the dispatcher on the phone. I tried. I really did. Every question made me feel crazy. I felt the lunacy of it all wash over me; I began nibbling on my fingernails, particularly the pinky on my right hand.

The sun and the air made me feel better. I chewed on my nails.

“You’re apartment is covered in black mold?” The dispatcher asked incredulously.

Almost angry, I tore my hand from my mouth while nibbling at the nail on my pinky finger and went to scream but caught myself in a gasp as I’d torn away too much. Examining the trickle of blood that spilled from beneath the edge of the nail, I froze and stared.

I examined the nailbed. It was black and veiny underneath. It seemed to writhe under my skin.

Dropping the phone into my lap, I hiked the sleeve of my coat up on my right arm and saw black lines had developed across my skin—the skin itself had begun to rise like the edges of pizza crust. Or like growing cauliflower. I pushed the skin and felt a release of hot liquid dash the length of my forearm. The substance was black as oil.

The dispatcher was screaming on the phone. “Are you alright?” I think that’s what they were saying.

I felt a pressure behind my right eyeball. With a blink, I felt something like a loose lash tickle around its edges.

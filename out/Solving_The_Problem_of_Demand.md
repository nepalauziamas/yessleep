Look, we all know the game, right? Life sucks and then you die. You spend every day from age 18 to age 65 doing whatever it takes to get money so you can afford to have a life. Renting a house, leasing a car, feeding your kids, all that shit. Nobody likes doing it. Nobody gets what they want, but that’s just the way the world works and as much as some kids like to dream about uprooting the Capitalist economy and building something else, it’s never going to happen.

&#x200B;

The simple fact of the matter is that if things weren’t the way they were, if we all didn’t unanimously agree as a society to engage in this complicated dance of fucking each other over for imaginary numbers, we wouldn’t be better off. I don’t mean to sound like I’m sucking the ‘Mans’ dick here, I hate it as much as anyone else. But if we didn’t have people doing the shit jobs that nobody fucking wants to do, nobody would do them. If we didn’t exploit migrant workers in Malaysia to build our computers and phones, we either wouldn’t have them or we’d have been priced out of ever buying them ages ago. Sorry if these are some shitty truths, but it’s a shitty world out there and there’s nothing any of us can do to fix it. But I’ll put a pin in my tirade against society for now. I’ve got what you might describe as a far more pressing problem...

&#x200B;

I took the job at Emperor Meats because that’s what was available. The town I live in doesn’t exactly have the greatest economy. Your two choices are get fucked by the Temp agencies, or don’t get a job. The factories and warehouses in my town don’t give a shit about anyone. We’re all just disposable numbers to them. That’s where the Temp agencies come in. They say how many workers they need for a day, and the agencies fill the positions.

&#x200B;

Technically there is a rule that if you stay at one place for three months, they have to hire you on. But most of the factories find a reason to cut you right before your three months is up. Then a few weeks later you’re back on the line, and the timer starts again. I’d raise more of a fuss about it, but I’ve got a wife at home, and kids to feed. Bitching about a shitty situation never put food on anybody's table. Working on the packing line at Emperor though? That’s a different story.

&#x200B;

I must’ve been there for almost seven months, at that point… Long enough that they should’ve hired me on ages ago, but those cheap fucks wouldn’t ever dream of it. No, they’d fucked me around just like they’d fucked everybody else. I didn’t take it personally. The work was fairly simple and the shifts went by fast. I could’ve been doing a hell of a lot worse.

&#x200B;

Emperor only ever allowed the temps to work on the packing line. I know that they brought in the animal's live, then slaughtered and butchered them on site, but they never made the temps do it. Thank fuck for that. I’ve never killed an animal before and I’d rather not start if I can avoid it. That feels like the kind of thing that would grate on your soul. No. What the temps did was take the cuts of meat and pack them in order to be shipped off to all the local grocery stores. Easy peasy. Packing and shipping is more or less the same wherever you go. Had I not seen what I’ve seen, I probably would’ve said that working at Emperor was borderline boring… Hell I wish that were really the case…

&#x200B;

It was a little earlier this week when I got a look at the other parts of the slaughterhouse. It was an accident, I swear it was. My line had run out of plastic wrap and I was the unlucky bastard who was sent to pick some back up before our last roll ran out completely.

&#x200B;

You’d think most factories would ruin smoothly, like a well oiled machine but there’s so many little places to get stuck along the line. A few little mistakes can lead to big pains in the ass. In this case, whoever usually kept the storage closet supplied with plastic wrap hadn’t done their job and it was empty. Then, when I asked a supervisor where to find more, I must’ve asked the guy there who gave the least amount of shits. He didn’t even look up at me as he said:

&#x200B;

“Check the closet by inspection. It’s just down the hall, if you see the sign for the killing floor, you’ve gone too far.”

&#x200B;

Sure, that was reassuring. But like I said before, bitching never put food on anyone's plate, and I had a time limit so I took off in the direction the supervisor had given me.

&#x200B;

The killing floor was hard to miss. Trust me, the animal screams weren’t exactly subtle. Down where I usually worked, you generally couldn’t hear them. The machinery drowned out what few echoes made it down the halls, so I can’t exactly say I was used to the sound of slaughter. Frightened animal screams, pigs most likely, followed by a sudden silence. I knew what was happening. I’d seen it on TV. The workers stunned the pigs, then strung them up and slashed their throats. Not a pretty way to go, but hey, I don’t make the rules.

&#x200B;

Even if the animal screams weren’t a dead giveaway, it would’ve been easy not to accidentally wander onto the Killing Floor. I could see a doorway off to the side labeled ‘*INSPECTION*’ in bright yellow. It was damn near impossible to miss. The door swung open at my touch and I was greeted by the pleasant sight of several hanging pig carcasses moving slowly on a line. They’d been skinned and gutted, and honestly didn’t look all that disturbing. There’s a point during meat production where the meat stops looking like an animal and starts looking more like what you see on your plate and those pigs were more or less at that point. I probably should’ve immediately started looking for the storage closet, but hey, I’m a curious guy. I figured that watching the inspectors look over the meat couldn’t have hurt.

&#x200B;

They didn’t seem to notice me as they went through the bodies, doing their quick inspections before letting them pass and I didn’t imagine they minded being watched at all. Or maybe they did…

&#x200B;

When I first saw something strange on the line, I was willing to ignore it. A pig that looked a little too skinny wasn’t that big of a deal. But when I noticed a second one, and then a third, I started to get a little curious. They weren’t consistent, but scattered in amongst the pigs were narrower animals. Without heads, skin or their lower limbs it was hard to say exactly what they were. My first guess was something exotic, like an Alpaca or something. I’d seen a guy butchering an Alpaca on TV and this looked a little bit like that. Why mix another animal in with the pigs though? That seemed weird to me. The factory I was in mostly dealt in pork. Why the fuck was there anything else on the line?

&#x200B;

The inspectors didn’t look too concerned though, even when more and more of those narrower carcasses started coming in until it was almost exclusively them. They just kept on with their work. It was around that time that I started noticing really funny about the upper limbs of the animals too. See, with pigs, their front limbs aren’t really meant to go up over their heads. I’d imagine it’s the same with most four legged animals. Their limbs generally hang down at an obtuse angle, but whatever these animals were, theirs went straight down. Just like…

&#x200B;

Shit… Just like a person…

&#x200B;

And the longer I stared at those bodies that moved past on the inspection line, the more I realized that those looked a hell of a lot like human bodies. Humanlike arms, legs, torsos… Shit…

&#x200B;

It’s hard to describe just what I was feeling when it became impossible to deny what I was looking at. My heart started beating faster. My legs felt a little like jelly. My stomach started to churn and the only thing that I could think to do was get the fuck out of there.

&#x200B;

I counted myself lucky that the inspectors didn’t turn around and see me when I stumbled back out the door and into the hallway again, although I wouldn’t say I was *that* lucky... You see, out in the hall the machinery wasn’t quite as loud, so I could hear the ‘animal’ screams.

&#x200B;

Y’know I’d never heard pigs beg before.

*“No, no, no… Please no… Please… I don’t… I don’t wanna-”*

Silence. Next.

*“Wait, wait! Don’t do this! Don’t… NO-”*

Silence. Next.

&#x200B;

There was a wordless sobbing that conveyed a terror I felt all too well in my soul. The kind of horrified cries that made part of me want to run to the rescue… But the moment I lifted a foot, then those too fell silent and I remained there frozen, listening as human voices cried out, screamed and begged only to inevitably and abruptly end, lost amongst the churn of machinery and the next frail voice.

&#x200B;

I stood there like a helpless toddler for what felt like hours, feeling the color drain from my face as one by one I heard strangers die… Their voices far away, but loud enough to haunt me. They screamed in different languages, they begged for the sake of their children, they pleaded to God for mercy. It didn’t matter. It didn’t change the fact that they all ended.

&#x200B;

Even now, I tell myself I couldn’t have possibly saved them… But in that moment, it felt like a lie. I’d started to back away, unsure of just where I was going. Part of me wanted to return to my line and play dumb, or fake sick to get the fuck out of there…

&#x200B;

But one little thought in the back of my mind dug away at me. If I went back to my line without the wrapping I’d been sent to get, that might be a little suspicious. With the line changed over… Shit…Would they know what I’d seen? Hell, with how long I’d stood there I was already suspicious enough!

&#x200B;

No… No, I couldn’t look suspicious… No fucking way… If they knew what I’d seen, it could be me on that line next! Jesus, it could be Ellen, or Laurie, my little girl! No. Oh no. No, no, no! I wasn’t going to let that happen!

&#x200B;

I tried to breathe in. I tried to keep my composure. I don’t know how I managed, but somehow I did. Walking back onto the Inspection Line felt like nothing short of the single most terrifying thing I’d done in my entire life. But I did it.

&#x200B;

The supply closet was thankfully close to the door. If I’d been smart, I could’ve avoided this whole fucking mess without even being seen. But hey, if I was smart I would’ve left town ages ago and I’d be playing the same fucking game in an office… Although any way you slice it, I’d still be better off…

If there is a God, maybe I should thank Him or Her that whoever stocked the Inspection Lines closet wasn’t a complete ninny. There was plastic wrap. God only fucking knows why they needed it on that line, but it was there and I grabbed three rolls before getting the hell out of dodge! Nobody saw me, at least, I was sure that nobody had seen me.

&#x200B;

I caught a little bit of shit for taking so long once I made it back with the plastic wrap, but I played it off as feeling a bit nauseous. I’d been hoping my supervisor would immediately send me home and they absolutely did and I’ve never been so goddamn happy to leave work in my life.

&#x200B;

To say that I slept that night would be bullshit. I told Ellen that I wasn’t feeling too great, and went straight to bed as soon as I got home. She didn’t bother me much and I feigned sleep when she eventually came to bed. Part of me wanted to tell her what I’d seen that day… Part of me really did. But I was terrified she’d either freak out, or tell me I was crazy!

&#x200B;

Another part of me hoped that I really was crazy and everything I’d seen that night was just some fucked up hallucination or a bad dream. I knew it wasn’t, though. Oh no… I knew it wasn’t.

&#x200B;

Now if I were a smart man, I would’ve called the temp agency and told them I was done with Emperor Meats. But I still had a family to feed and I’ve never said no to a steady paycheque before. I reasoned that if I wasn’t crazy, then lots of people were involved in what the company was doing. Maybe that made it alright, right? Maybe whatever this was was secretly legal or something?

&#x200B;

Weak excuses, I know. I know I was lying to myself trying to justify ignoring what I’d seen in the faint hope that maybe I’d be proven wrong or that maybe, just maybe it would somehow be okay. Cowardice comes in many forms and not a single one is pretty. Everything boils down to the choice I made the next day to get up, get ready and go to work.

&#x200B;

Now, I know what you’re going to say. *“No, you idiot! What the fuck are you doing!”* I get it. I was thinking the exact same thing. But some desperate part of my brain was trying to dismiss what I’d seen as something that wasn’t possible, or to write it off as a mistake and forget I’d seen anything at all. Ignorance is bliss, right?

&#x200B;

When I actually got to work, there was no cabal of supervisors waiting to pull me off the floor to question me. There wasn’t a single goddamn thing out of place. The day just… went on, just like any other day. Weirdly enough that was the most reassuring thing that could happen. The meat came down the line, we packed it and sent it off to be shipped. Every hour, we rotated from station to station. It was the exact same shit I’d been doing for most of my career and I was just fine with that.

&#x200B;

I tried not to let myself look down at the meat we packed. Every time I did, I caught myself wondering just what kind of animal it came from. Sure, the label said pork. Pork chops, pork tenderloin, pork ribs… But was that really it? It all looked like pork. It all looked like the exact same shit I’d been happy to feed my family. But who knows, right?

&#x200B;

It was around lunch that the day took its one and only odd turn, and even then I can’t say what happened was all that out of place. When the bell rang for the first shifts lunch break and our line shut down, we all shuffled into the break room to see that the chairs and tables had been moved around and set up for a presentation. I’d seen this once before, early on after I’d been hired. Apparently, every six months our factory got a visit from the President of the company for a brief ‘Town Hall’. A table on one corner had pizza set up. This was all standard operating procedure more or less… Last time we had a little more notice before a meeting like this, but considering how at ease the full time employees seemed to be, maybe they’d gotten a memo that the temps hadn’t. Either way, I wasn’t about to bitch about free pizza. I grabbed a slice and found a seat.

&#x200B;

I noticed a man in a neatly pressed button down shirt standing patiently in the corner, smiling politely at anyone who met his gaze. I placed him at somewhere in his forties or fifties, although it would’ve been easy to mistake him as younger than that. He had conventionally handsome features and looked like he’d taken damn good care of his body. I’d seen him once before, at a meeting exactly like this six months ago. He didn’t need any introduction to me, but he gave one all the same once everyone was seated and he took his position front and centre.

&#x200B;

“Good afternoon everyone! To those of you who know me, it’s great to see you again and to those of you who are new here, welcome. I’m Allan Pond, I’m the President of Emperor Meats.” He offered a charming smile before leaning casually against the wall behind him. Someone hit the lights and someone else at the back of the room turned on a projector that brought up a slideshow.

&#x200B;

“Most of you are familiar with our semi-annual review and town hall but to those who aren’t, I like to take the time to sit down with you all and go over where we’re going as a company and what our roadmap for the future looks like. I’m a strong believer in transparency. We’re all working towards the same goals here, and it’s important to work towards them together…”

&#x200B;

I won’t go through everything that Pond said during that meeting, mainly because I wasn’t really paying attention. There was a slideshow about revenue, output and whatnot and some corporate fluff to make us feel good about our jobs. Nothing more, nothing less. I suppose to Ponds credit, at least he put in some effort into making us all feel less like cogs in a machine. But all the positive buzzwords in the world wouldn’t hide that fact and he should’ve known it. Still… Even if I didn’t entirely care, I still welcomed the corporate fluff. There was a sense of mundane normalcy to it. This was the kind of shit you’d hear at any other job and it took my mind off what I thought I’d seen the other day…

&#x200B;

Pond's slideshow and spiel didn’t last that long. 45 minutes, give or take. Then we were allowed another 15 minutes to stay on break, a rare treat for us. I figured I’d take that time to pop by the bathroom for a piss while I had the chance, although that wasn’t exactly a 15 minute task.

&#x200B;

What I’d seen the other day still lingered in the back of my mind. I felt a little better about things, sure. I’d mostly convinced myself that I’d had somehow imagined all of it. It’s easier than you think to lie to yourself. When a person is confronted with something they don’t want to believe, they’ll do incredible things just to ignore reality. And the worst part is, you’d never think you’d ever end up so deluded until you do.

&#x200B;

I would’ve been more than happy to go back to the lunch room, shoot the shit with some of the other guys on the line and get on with my life. That would’ve been the best thing I could do. But there was still that lingering pit in my stomach. That creeping sickness that kept me from going back… That one most selfish need of any human being… Validation. Not validation that I was right. God no, I would’ve given anything not to be right… But validation that I really was completely fucking insane!

&#x200B;

I’d almost convinced myself that I was the one who was crazy, but when the proof was right down the hall, how could I say no? If I was right and it really was nothing, I’d get a slap on the wrist. If I was wrong? Well… I’d deal with that later.

&#x200B;

Like a machine on autopilot, I found myself walking back towards the factory floor and following the same path I’d taken the other day towards Inspection. The screams in the hall were unmistakably those from pigs being led to the slaughter. That’s not a sound that should ever set a person at ease, but in my case, it did exactly that…

&#x200B;

I drew closer to the door marked *‘INSPECTION’* and pushed it open just a smidgen. Enough to confirm that there were nothing but pig carcasses on the line. There’s another sight I could add to the category of things that shouldn’t have been soothing, but were anyways. That should’ve been enough for me… It really should’ve been. But either I’ve got the worst luck in the world, the worst timing in the world or perhaps life just like to fuck me in the ass. Who the hell knows?

&#x200B;

As I turned away, satisfied to return to my grind in blissful ignorance I heard the sound of someone sobbing and my blood ran ice cold. Over the machinery, echoing down the hall I could hear it… A young woman by the sounds of it. I could hear her desperately trying to put together words, her voice carrying a heavy accent that made it clear she wasn’t too familiar with English.

&#x200B;

*“No… No, please… No, please… No… NO!”*

&#x200B;

That final word was screamed loud enough to cut through the hum of machinery that ran throughout the factory and just like before, I found myself rooted to the spot as reality hit me like a goddamn brick to the fucking head.

&#x200B;

There was no denying what was right in front of me. There was no more false hope to cling to. No more lying to myself so I could ignore this… Jesus, the very thought that I would’ve actually tried to carry on with my life, knowing what I knew seemed like a bad joke, now…  But at the same time, carrying on with my life might have easily been the only thing I could have done!

&#x200B;

Let me take a step back here. What would you have done in my situation? Charge in like Harrison fucking Ford to rescue the captives? Chances are if I’d been that stupid, I’d have gotten killed for my trouble. Go to the Police with no real proof? Even if the cops in my town gave a shit about anything, I doubt they’d have fucking believed me!

&#x200B;

No… There wasn’t a single logical idea in my mind for what I could do. There wasn’t a single course of action, aside from going back to my line and doing my fucking job that I could think to take, that didn’t have a good chance of ending badly… But as I heard the next voice start to beg… Weak, and frightened, I finally figured that in an illogical situation, an illogical action was the only option.

&#x200B;

When I moved, I moved towards the killing floor, not away from it.

&#x200B;

I came up with the plan in my mind as I got closer. Maybe if I could snap some pictures or some video, then maybe the Police might get off their fat asses and do something about this! It was worth the shot, wasn’t it? Jesus, please let it be worth a shot… I had my phone in my pocket, and I started filming before I even got to the doors. At least I picked up some of the screams from the hallway. (Should’ve thought of that before, damnit…) before I made it to the doors. This was it. No going back now…

&#x200B;

I took a deep breath and stepped out onto the Killing Floor, not knowing what I was going to see but hoping like hell I really was wrong. I wasn’t. By fucking God I wasn’t…

&#x200B;

I could see them hung by their legs, arms hanging down and blood spewing from their necks… Men and women of all ages, some of them older, others little more than teenagers. They’d been stripped naked like animals and their throats had been slashed with a single clean, neat cut. The fresher ones were still twitching as the blood drained out of them, into a trough.

&#x200B;

*“Wait… Wait… No… No, don’t…”* I could hear a voice saying and looked over to see a man in his forties, someone not much older than me hanging in front of the butcher. The poor bastard was crying and struggling to blink the tears out of his eyes. He tried to squirm, but it didn’t do him any good. The knife glided effortlessly across his throat, sealing his fate.

&#x200B;

Behind him, I could see a young woman in her twenties, blinking slowly and starting to wake up. Even further behind her, I could see another woman being hoisted up by her leg, and I could hear the screams of the man in line behind her getting shocked, so that the workers could hoist him up. Jesus… It was a whole fucking line of them…

&#x200B;

On another line, I could see pigs getting the same treatment. But the pigs didn’t beg for their lives, although I’m damn sure they would have if they could… None of the workers paid me any mind. Like a well oiled machine, they just did their work. Shocking the meat, hoisting it up and bleeding them before moving on to the next one. There was a cold impersonality to it…

&#x200B;

I always thought death would be something big and significant. That’s always how it looks in the movies… But these people just slowed to a stop once their throats were cut. Some of them pissed or shit themselves. Most of them continued to struggle as they bled but in the end… All of them slowed to a stop as they were pushed on to the next part of the line.

&#x200B;

My heart was racing as I watched it. I felt sick to my stomach and whatever ill advised bravado had inspired me to step foot onto the Killing Floor was gone now! I couldn’t move any deeper. I’d made it exactly two steps in and I couldn’t stay any longer. My phone however had picked up enough evidence to damn these fuckers for the things they’d done.

&#x200B;

I stumbled backwards, heading straight for the door and back into the hallway. I wasn’t even going to bother faking sick this time. Hell no. No, I was leaving! I was getting the hell out of there and going straight to the goddamn cops! I was… I wasn’t going fucking anywhere.

&#x200B;

In the middle of the concrete hall stood Mr. Pond, smiling gently at me as if he’d just caught my hand in the cookie jar.

“Hello Bob.” He said, his tone calm and jovial, “It is Bob, right? I remember you from the last Town Hall… I’m surprised we haven’t hired you on yet.”

&#x200B;

I just stared at him. He was alone. No burly guards flanking him as far as I could see. But just by himself he looked like somebody I didn’t want to fuck with.

&#x200B;

“I’m sorry for sneaking up on you.” He continued, “One of the Supervisors mentioned you’d left the packing and shipping area and I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.”

“It’s fine…” I lied. It was a bad lie. I was pale as a ghost and shaking like a leaf. I was still holding my phone and I knew without a doubt that I was fucked.

&#x200B;

“No it’s not. I understand that what you just saw in there may have been very upsetting. I don’t want to put you under any undue stress so I thought it might be easier to discuss this with you in person… Why don’t we go for a walk, Bob? Somewhere a little less noisy, perhaps…”

He approached me with a warm smile and put his arm around me. Then he gently plucked my phone from my hand and led me back towards the shipping area. My line had started up again by the time we passed it. I half hoped that Pond would just leave me there to get back to work, but I wasn’t so naive to think that I’d get off that easy.

&#x200B;

Mr. Pond led me straight back to the lunchroom, which shouldn’t have been empty, but it was.

“We’ll have to make this quick, I’m afraid. I did ask to delay the second shifts lunch until we’d had a chance to speak. I’m sure they won’t be too happy about that. There’s still some pizza left over if you want some. Take as much as you please, I’ve got more coming for the next shift.”

&#x200B;

His tone was polite and conversational as if nothing was wrong. Despite his offer, I didn’t have any appetite for pizza. Instead, I just stood by the door until he invited me to sit, then like an obedient dog I found a nearby seat and planted myself in it.

Pond looked at the phone he’d taken from me. I could hear the playback from the video I’d recorded and I saw his kind smile falter, just a little bit. He didn’t finish the video before he paused it and pocketed my phone.

&#x200B;

“It’s an ugly business, isn’t it?” He asked, “But the people want meat… Even if it’s best not to think about where it comes from.”

“They’re people…” Was all I could manage to say, “Those were people on that line…”

“Yes, they were people.” Pond said, his tone still so matter of fact. “Meat production is expensive. We make good money, yes. But wherever you can save a few dollars, you should. Don’t you agree?”

“*They’re people*, Mr. Pond!”

He shrugged.

&#x200B;

“Yes. Runaways, homeless, immigrants… I’m sure that somebody in the world will miss them, but they’re nobody that anyone will look too hard for. Now, I’ll agree that what we’re doing is… unorthodox. Perhaps we can even go so far as to admit that it is illegal. However with enough people paid to look the other way, anything becomes legal and with the money we make it’s far more beneficial to everyone's bottom line if this arrangement continues.”

&#x200B;

“You’re fucking killing people and you’re talking about money? Are you out of your goddamn mind?”

“Additional product at no cost to purchase? It makes sense, doesn’t it? In the end, I only pay the salaries of the men I hire to procure that product, and pad the salaries of the men under my employ in exchange for their silence. When all is said and done, the numbers make sense. And I haven’t even gotten started on what our market share looks like. The customer is always going to want meat, Bob. What we sell will always be in high demand, and with this… We’re padding our supply and solving the problem of demand. With a high supply, and a high demand, we can sell larger portions for a better price. It’s simple economics. The customer will usually choose the best value for the best price. Now I’m not a monster, I’m not going to sell human kidneys and lie that they’re pork. I assure you, most of our… Alternative meat sources end up in our ground pork products. The taste actually blends quite well with the pork. Some might say it even enhances it!”

&#x200B;

“I can’t believe you’re trying to justify this… You really are out of your fucking mind…”

“I do what it takes to keep Emperor Meats ahead in the market.” Pond said dismissively, “We all do whatever is necessary to take care of ourselves. On that, I know that you and I agree.”

He took out my phone again and tampered with it for a moment, before pausing.

“Would you mind giving me your password? I should delete that video before I send you home…”

&#x200B;

I looked up at him.

“Send me home?” I asked, “What are you talking about?”

“You’ve had a stressful couple of days. I think some time off would do you well. I’m not firing you. On the contrary, my intention was to offer you a permanent position on our staff. Not on the Killing Floor, of course. No, no. I think it’s obvious that you have no interest in that. But one of our Supervisors in the Shipping and Packaging department is due to retire soon so there will be a spot opening up…”

His smile returned, as charming as ever.

&#x200B;

“You’re hiring me?” I asked, in genuine disbelief, “You… You’re not gonna kill me?”

“Please, Bob. I’m not a Bond Villain! The mysterious disappearance of an employee would cause far more problems than it would solve. However a significant pay raise, job security, health insurance… All in exchange for one tiny little thing. Your silence… But first, your phone password, please.”

&#x200B;

I was silent for a moment. I hated the fact that I was legitimately considering his offer… I hated the fact that I was actually buying whatever bullshit he was spewing!

&#x200B;

“And what if I say no?” I asked, my voice cracking slightly.

“Well, I must admit it will be inconvenient. I’d have to cease some of our operations and sanitize the line. While I highly doubt anyone would believe you, I need to protect my company and my employees. Anyways, if that is the case and you’re not interested in my offer, I wish you well in your future endeavors… But I do ask you to at least give it a few days. Think it over and we’ll talk when you get back… Now, your phone password please. I’d rather not have to break it.”

&#x200B;

I stared at him, looking dead into his eyes. The fact that he hadn’t raised his voice once scared me more than if he’d just started screaming at me. His relaxed demeanor made me believe every single thing he said.

&#x200B;

I gave him my phone password and when he gave me back my phone, the video was gone. That was the end of that.

I’m sharing this to at least get the truth out there. Maybe somebody, somewhere will believe me when I say that this is the truth. Maybe somebody else will be able to do something about it. But the thing is, I think that what Mr. Pond said was right. No matter how much I try to get this out there, no matter how many people actually believe this, it’s not going to change anything. The line will keep running, nobody’s going to stop it. We’ll all just keep playing the same old game, even if we wish that things could be better.

But this is reality. Nothing ever gets better. No matter how loudly you scream, or how hard you try, nothing ever gets better. There’s no coming revolution, there’s no future free of the shackles we’ve made for ourselves. It’s just going to be the same old bullshit from 9 to 5 for the rest of our existence as humans.

That’s why I’m going to tell Mr. Pond that I’ve accepted his job tomorrow. I’m going to do what I should’ve done from Day one. Shut my mouth, keep my head down and do the job I was hired to do. And hey… A little extra money for my trouble might not be so bad. [I’ve got to take care of my own, after all.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/comments/mn640v/solving_the_problem_of_demand/)

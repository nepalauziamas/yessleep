So, every month there's a student in my school that randomly goes missing there's a search for a day and then the student is forgotten.

&#x200B;

I always think what if it's me next or someone I know, but I don't have to worry because there are at least 2,000 students in my school, and the person who always goes missing is someone I don't know. or at least something I didn't need to worry about. Until this month. 

Just yesterday, Me and my friend Devin were walking around our Highschool campus and we were having fun until I got a phone call apparently someone was waiting for me at my dorm and I went to my dorm but no one was there so then I headed back to where Devin and I were when I came back Devin wasn't there so I called her and she didn't pick up. I got scared for a second when I thought that maybe she got taken this month but then she called me...

I felt so relieved that I almost forgot to pick up the call but what I heard sent chills down my back. I heard a deep voice saying if I don't find her by Wednesday night she'd be dead and her body would be in the school cafeteria.

I had to get to work right away, today was Monday. I had 60 hours to find her before she is murdered." I have to do this for her I have to find Devin" I told myself. 

I got to work right away I had snuck out during the night to try and get some or any clues I needed to find Devin and I needed to do it before Wednesday Night. The only things I found were cigarette butts and a lot of trash on the floor. I have never noticed how dirty our campus was before today.

So then, I did something I never thought I would do, I cleaned the campus to check for any leads I threw away any cigarette butts I found threw away all the chip packets, and all the trash I could find. I still didn't find a single clue. Or I thought so. The next day when I woke up I realized that when I was coming back to my dorm I saw something from the corner of my eye but I just thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me. 

But now I realized I could've seen something and checked it out. So, I did exactly that I went outside of my dorm and I saw a bunch of kids gathered around where I thought I saw something. I went to check it and I became Terrified at what I saw it was a dead student. I didn't know this person but someone was dead the people who called me weren't lying. 

I only had 48 hours now and I had to get moving. I fled from the scene at once and my head was rushing with thoughts is Devin dead  I thought are there more dead students?  I didn't have time to be scared right now I had to do something right now I felt weak, I felt like I would never be able to find her in time. But then it happened. 

I was running away when I went face first into a wall and fainted. when I woke up it was already night and everyone was in their dorm. I heard whispers as soon as I got up I thought I was hearing things but then I snapped back into reality and I followed the sound of the Whispers That's where I saw them. There were 2 animals or things I don't know how to describe them but they looked Horrible. I almost puked when I saw them but stopped myself because I could've died.

"Did you get the girl" I heard one of them say this one was pretty short. "Yeah, I have the girl we can perform the ritual now" I heard the taller one say. "Aren't we going to see if the boy finds her?" the shorter one said. "NO! You fool why would we wait and even if we did the fool would never find her." the taller one yelled at the shorter one "But Seth" said the shorter one. 

So, I thought the taller one's name is Seth. What a weird name. 

"Abigor How many times have I told you not to call me that disgusting name! If a human hears us they can send us back to the torture realm if they call us by our names. Call me Master!" Seth sounded Very mad but I didn't think anything of it. But now I knew both of their names and I could send them back to the torture realm whenever I wanted to. 

"Now I must go back to the Chamber to continue the Ritual," Seth told Abigor. but before he left without knowing I yelled "WAIT" Both of the demon-like things looked at me "Give me Back Devin or else I'll send both of you guys back to the torture realm" I demanded 

They just looked at me and started laughing "You actually believe you can send us back to the torture realm you mortal" Said Seth "ABIGOR" I shouted and the shorter one disappeared then "Wa-wa-What did you do?" Seth yelled at me "Give me Devin now or else I'll send you to the torture realm as well." I demanded but as soon as I finished what I said I felt something sharp in my neck and then I blacked out. When I woke up it was Thursday and Devin was sitting next to me and she looked better than ever. 

Then something happened that I thought would never happen. Devin leaned in to kiss me.

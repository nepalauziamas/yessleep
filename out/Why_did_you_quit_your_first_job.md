“I don’t have a home,” the white-haired little boy whispered to me as he held out a hand.

I’ll be honest, that sent a chill down my spine. “What do you mean?” I asked, squinting down the hallway of the haunted house that served as my first place of employment. “Did you lose your mom or dad somewhere in there?”

He said nothing. The boy’s hand remained outstretched, his dark eyes fixed on me. 

I looked up and down once more, praying for any sign of a frantic parent seeking a lost kid. But the dark hallway showed no signs of life. I sighed and took his hand. It felt like ice, and I failed to hide how his touch made my entire body shiver. 

I walked him down the hallway to the hidden office in the back. I was worried that he would freak out as we stepped across oversized, furry spider legs and around skeletons chained to the wall, but he seemed to calm down with his hand in mine. 

I opened the door and stepped inside my boss’s office. He was on his feet, facing the opposite wall while talking on his cell. The door creaked as I opened it; he hesitated a moment before turning around and looking at the two of us. His face immediately fell.

“I’ll have to call you back,” he whispered before hanging up the phone. His mustache twitched before he approached us, giving the kid a wide berth as he closed the office door behind me.

“Um,” I began awkwardly, “hey, Chuck. This little guy seems to have lost his mom and dad-”

“Did it talk to you?” Chuck whispered.

“Uh – the kid?” I looked down at his wide, dark eyes with irises so black that they seemed like giant pupils. “Yeah, we talked about how we’re going to get him home safely. Right?”

His icy hand gripped mine tighter.

The silence stretched past “awkward” and into “creepy.”

Chuck finally spoke. “It said that it didn’t have a home, right?”

His grip squeezed painfully tight.

“Ow. Um… yes, but I promised him that we would make it right.”

Chuck looked at me with the saddest gaze before raising the cell to his ear. “Close everything up. Yes, right now.” He ended the call without breaking eye contact. “You can go home early tonight, Claire. Just as soon as we’re done here.”

Before I could ask for an explanation, he walked around the kid once more, never getting within three feet, and opened the door. “Follow me.”

He exited back into the hallway before I could get an explanation, so I moved after him. I was slowed by the kid’s hesitation, though; I practically had to drag him forward. 

“Chuck!” I called, feeling pulled in opposite directions. “Just – what are we *doing*?”

He said nothing. Instead, he just looked up and down the hallway, apparently making sure that no one could see us, before kneeling down by the props. It was nearly impossible to tell what he was doing; what little light permeated the room was blood red to heighten the creep factor, leaving mostly shadow to dominate the hidden corners. “Chuck,” I gasped upon finally reaching him. “*What* is going on?” 

Instead of answering, he lifted one of the prop shackles and clamped it onto the kid’s free hand.

My breath stopped.

“Claire,” he demanded in a low voice, “give me his other hand.”

I stared at his glowing red glasses, too petrified to move.

Before I could react, he reached out and snapped a second shackle on the little boy’s arm.

I opened my mouth to protest as I looked down at the hand I was holding.

The boy’s fingers had been replaced by five long, writhing tentacles. My jaw fell as I looked up at his face to see that his eyes had gone entirely black. Twin trails of tears glowed red upon his cheeks. 

“The skeletons aren’t props, Claire,” he sighed. 

I stared back and forth between the two of them. Chuck looked weary beyond words.

“I know this seems cruel, but it’s the only way to keep us safe. They seem docile when young, but if even one got out…” He wiped his brow. “Go home, Claire. I don’t blame you if you don’t come back tomorrow.”

I let go of the boy and stepped away, unable to form words, and walked dazedly out of the building. 

Stepping out into the cool night air felt like transporting myself into a different world. I headed toward home, deciding that I had just quit my first job and could make $19.13 per night somewhere else.

By the time I was halfway there, I had nearly convinced myself that I’d imagined the whole thing. I reached up to wipe away a tear of relief. 

That’s when I saw that my index finger had been replaced by a writhing, dancing [tentacle](https://www.facebook.com/P-F-McGrail-181784199029462/).

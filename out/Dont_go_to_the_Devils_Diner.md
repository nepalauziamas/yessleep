A couple of days ago I found myself on a lengthy drive home from a meeting. I was sure I was going to reach home just before dark; a small pleasure as I was extremely tired. I will admit I was going slightly over the speed limit, though the road I took was relatively empty, with only the occasional truck or car speeding in the opposite direction.

After a while, I realized I was running out of gas. I probably had enough to get home... but I needed to drive to work the next day and there wouldn't be time to stop at a gas station in the morning.

These thoughts flashed through my mind, among other thoughts of worry:

I wondered what exactly I worked so hard for. *I hate my career and I don't work to provide for anyone but myself. Is my life just to be a job I hate and felt more machine than man in? Am I to die feeling so empty?*

These existential ideas frightened me. I lowered my window and smoked a cigarette as I drove.

I felt, rather starved. Even a bit ravenous. That was around the time I saw a gas station, with what looked like a diner attached. It called to me like a siren's song, the shadow of the building falling on my car as I approached. I parked my car near the station and headed into the diner to eat something.

"The Devil's Diner" I read the name aloud to myself. I had never heard of or seen this place before but I was too hungry to care. I gingerly opened the glass door and entered.

The room had a retro aesthetic, with checker-board floors and neon lighting. The tables were metal and slightly grimy. The seats were bright red.

A single figure sat behind a sauce-stained counter, beneath a series of appetizing hanging menus. She wore a white apron over a black dress and had long ginger hair. Her oddly somber eyes were an elegant green. She started at me for about 3 minutes as I looked at the menus, then asked me for my order. Her voice was soft and slightly hoarse.

"Can I just have a cheese burger and some fries. As well as a coffee, please." I said.

"Sure, Sir." she responded coldly

"Are you the only person here?" I inquired. I had walked through the parking and gas station without seeing a soul on the premises, except for the young lady in front of me.

"Yes. Only I choose to remain here. You may have seen the convenience store is already closed." she said.

I nodded in response though in truth I had not noticed. I sat down at a table and waited for my food.

It did not take long to arrive, likely because I was the only customer. I devoured it, I was incredibly hungry. It actually tasted better than I expected, coming from an abandoned place like this.

That was when things started to go from strange to insidious.

After finishing my food and paying the bill, I got up to leave and stumbled on my way to the door. I felt dizzy, my head was ringing, and everything glowed in bright psychedelic colors. I collapsed on the hard, dirty floor.

Some time later, I woke up and found myself in a dark room. I was tied up and I could feel something cold and stiff slumped next to me. I realized I had probably been drugged. My wallet and phone were missing.

As my eyes adjusted to the dark, I saw shelves upon shelves of dolls on the walls. They varied in size and some were on the floor and as large as humans. The thing slumped next to me was a man. He appeared to be dead. His eyes were removed, leaving behind 2 gaping holes. A lot of facial skin had also been removed. I held in a petrified scream.

I noticed a bloody knife next to a doll. In the dim light, I saw the lines of veins and splotches of blood around the eyes of the doll. I reached for the knife. Clumsily, I was able to clasp it and unbind myself with its blade.

I ran out of an unlocked door. It was the dead of night, but the stars illuminated my way.

My car was gone! Vanished, like a ghost.

I heard footsteps approaching. Without thinking, I ran, sprinting down the road as if my life depended upon it.

After a few minutes, my car drove down the road towards me. Knowing it may have been my kidnapper, I dove between the trees and bushes, then climbing up a tree and hiding in its thorny branches. I ignored the pain as someone investigated the area before getting in my car and driving off. My breathing and heart-rate slowed.

I climbed down and continued following the road. My legs ached and I was covered in cuts and bruises. The cold night air bit into the skin.

I eventually found a hotel where I phoned the police, who picked me up. Though I survived I worry that my freedom will not last long.

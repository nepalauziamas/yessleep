 

Six months ago, I landed my dream job. Now it’s probably not your dream job or really anyone else’s for that matter. But after four felonies (drugs charges don’t judge) it was as good a life as a 38-year-old who was finally getting their shit together could ask for.

I had ascended from HVAC apprentice to journeyman.

Heating cooling and ventilation is not all Rolex’s and red carpets like your uncle who likes to shame you for getting an art degree makes it out to be. 

It’s grueling, dirty and in the beginning actually low-paid work.

My first gig as an apprentice was with one of the only outfits in the city that hired felon’s and I spent three years dueling rodents and destroying my knees in dusty attics and crawlspaces. 

I fought countless rats, made peaceably with two possums and the one time I encountered a raccoon I consider a draw. Those bastards can scrap, especially when you have to face them on your back with a flashlight in your teeth so you can see your fists.

I digress. It sucked. But I’d put in my dues, expunged two felonies, and was hired by a desperate for help yet lucrative HVAC company in the suburbs as a mother fucking journeyman.

80k a year and all I had to do was go out to McMansions to tinker with their 4k Carriers. 

“Proudly made in the USA!” The suburban dads would exclaim and slap the sheet metal siding of the AC’s. Then not knowing anything else about the hardware they’d begin to slowly walk away to keep from any questions that might expose a chink in their masculine knowledge of machines. 

Everyday felt nearly the same in the suburbs. I almost missed the ever-present threat of rodents that kept me on my toes. I could hardly tell one house from another and even the cars in the driveway were the same. Silverado’s for the men and Suburban’s for the women. All that steel just to ferry their two children safely to soccer practice. 

It’s easy to shit on the suburbs but come on. The excess. The abundance. Excessively large lawns and cupboards stocked bulging from Costco. It was a glorious yet ridiculous achievement of humankind; these people had everything and nothing at the same time. 

The suburbs I serviced were largely Christian. To give more perspective I live in a place that most the country considers the Midwest, and that the Midwest considers the South. Maybe you can guess where that is. 

So, it wasn’t just cookie cutter homes, even the people seemed to be the same make and model. Everything the same. Everything proper with the homeowner association as the eye of Sauron, keeping the community homogenous with the fury of a soviet state. 

But it was behind the doors of these cream-colored homes where the patterns were more disturbing. 

Now I’m not a snoopy person. I believe that most people are pretty boring along with their fetishes that might fascinate their friends or neighbors. But handymen have seen it all. 

Sex swings. Live in gimps. Bedrooms that smell strangely of hay while a miniature pony holds his head up proudly in the backyard.

Ok maybe not all that but you get the idea.

This first summer has been a whirlwind. We’re understaffed and I had been running from appointment to appointment. When I went into homes it was usually with the driven purpose to reach my hand up to check AC vents or walking tunnel visioned to the thermostat. 

But I still saw them. It was impossible not to. 

I peeked at the signs in walk-in pantry’s and above wet bars. Sometimes they would hang on the wall in living rooms where a nice painting could go.

“Less whine. More wine!”

“Caution: Mom needs wine.”

“Taking motherhood one bottle at a wine.”

“Live, life, love, wine!”

So people were bored in these suburbs and alcohol altered reality. They had big homes and functional lives, so it seemed. Who was I, a drug felon mind you, to judge?

It wasn’t uncommon for me to arrive to a 10am appointment and see the suburban mom who greeted me with a glass of wine in her hand. When I got to an appointment after 3 the sight was almost a guarantee. 

But mommy wine culture was just another facet of suburban life that blended into the background for me. That was until I got a call to the Schultz house.  

The appointment was somewhat typical. A woman stated that one of her house’s AC outlets wasn’t blowing any air.

She led me into the living room. Her eyes were bloodshot, and she held a rose gold aluminum mug that read: “Mommy’s sippy cup”

I shuddered violently.

“You see,” She said. “This one here. It’s the only one that isn’t blowing any air.” She pointed to one of the central air outlets in the ceiling.

My eyes were stuck on the wall. A wood sign with white cursive font assured me that it wasn’t a hangover it was wineflu.

The woman’s name was Melissa. She had a couple kids and a husband who owned the Chevy dealership and she joked how easy it would be to have an affair since her husband parked a different truck in their driveway every day.

I ascended into the attic. Someone had been up there recently. Suburban attics were typically untouched since there were much more accessible places to store things in these large homes, but small footprints disturbed the dust.

There was enough room to stand, another blessing of these monstrous homes I suppose but littering the floor were dozens of boxes stacked so high they brushed my shoulders. A cardboard flap hung mostly open on one of the boxes and I parted it the rest of the way with a finger. 

I turned on my flashlight. Inside were black bottles of wine. Every box was a case of wine. 

“Fucking Christ.” I said and let the flap fall back. I shook my head as I walked to the cluster of vents. I frowned immediately. The ductwork was hanging lose from the wall. I stuck my hand down the vent and pulled out bottle after bottle of wine.

An entire case had been stuffed inside. After I’d reconnected the ductwork I picked one bottle off the floor to show Melissa and went back downstairs. 

I paused in the living room. She wasn’t where I’d last seen her. I walked to the kitchen where out the back windows I could see her kids scamper over a sprinkler in the backyard. 

“Hi!”

I jumped and turned around. Melissa was smiling at me with wine-stained teeth. In the poor light they appeared rotten black.

“Sorry.” I laughed. “You scared me.”

Her expression didn’t change any. “What are you doing with that?” She pointed to the bottle that hung in my hand. “That’s mine.”

“Oh of course!” I was partly panicking. There was something off about this woman and I wasn’t sure it was just the wine. “I know it’s yours. I brought this down here to show you. You see someone had stuffed wine bottles in the air conditioning system. I’m surprised only one vent wasn’t working.”

“That’s funny.” She said without question as if she actually thought it was funny. She snatched the bottle. “So, it works now?” 

“Yeah.” I stuttered. “I’m sure it does.”

“Ok!” The doorbell rang and she stepped past me. 

I started walking with her to leave and heard shouting from the entrance hall.

“It’s wine time!” 

Two more suburban moms walked through the front door each pumping a bottle of wine above their heads like lambs being brought to the altar.

Melissa raised the bottle she’d taken from me and cheered with them. They paid me no attention and crowded around a coffee table in the living room. 

All three of their heads were bowed to the bottles as one of the women set to work with a corkscrew.

“So, uh. You can pay now with a card or we can send you a bill.”

They all stopped and stared at me. I widened my eyes expecting a response, but they said nothing.

“Bill it is then.” I nodded and started to go but when the cork popped, I stopped. They stood silently and I watched as a smoke like substance rose out of the bottle and flowed into their nostrils. 

It was the same crimson color of the wine and when it reached their noses, they closed their eyes and inhaled deeply. 

When they opened their eyes again there were no pupils or whites. Their entire eyes were all a single shade of scarlet. 

Of merlot. 

I stood still in disbelief and jumped as the back door was thrown open with a crash. From the kitchen ran a crying child. 

“Mommy! Mommy! I hurt my finger.” It was a little girl, barely big enough to play by herself. Behind her stumbled her younger brother.  

“Oh honey.” Melissa blinked and her eyes returned to normal. She walked over to the girl.

She was moaning tears and the other women ignored the situation and began to fill their glasses. 

“Here.” Melissa grabbed a glass of wine and put it to the little girl’s lips. “Wine makes everything better. Even boo boos.”

“Especially boo boos.” Said one of the women and the three of them all laughed. 

“Mommy no!”

“Drink it!”

As a tradesman who works in people’s homes, I had been in my fair share of awkward family moments, but this was up there. 

I heard myself speak. “Excuse me I know it’s not my business, but she does seem a little young for wine.”

“Why of course.” Melissa said but one of her hands held the back of her daughter’s head while the other tilted the wine glass.

The little girl choked on the wine and spat some up. 

I was staring in disturbed shock. The girl ran off coughing and Melissa returned to the table.

“All better.” She said seemingly talking to herself.

“Now handyman,” The three women turned to look at me. “Isn’t wine incredible?”

I stared at them with my mouth agape for several seconds. “Uh. Yeah.”

They looked at me waiting to hear me sing its praises. “Great stuff,” I said. “You can make it in a bathtub.”

“You can?” Melissa said in stunned disbelief.

“Sure.” I said quickly and darted out the door without a goodbye. 

I told my boss about the incident suggesting I leave a tip with child services, but he wouldn’t hear it. He said those women would know it was his company that ratted and word spreads in those suburbs like wildfire. We wouldn’t be trusted in their homes. 

I was told if child services ever contacted that family I’d be out of a job. 

Lord god, why does everybody have to suck?

I dropped a tip anyway but never heard anything back. Thankfully I didn’t hear anything from my boss about it either. 

In the next few weeks while I was servicing more vinous homes, I swear I’d see in the eyes of the wine moms that same shade of scarlet spread from their pupils. But as soon as they’d blink it’d be gone. 

It was only a month later that I was called back to the Schultz house. I never would’ve returned but it was impossible to tell those homes apart and client’s names never stuck with me. 

I was clueless until the front door swung open and I saw those black teeth smiling at me.

“Come in!” Melissa held the door open as I stepped inside and closed it behind me. 

I stopped immediately while she kept walking and talking about her AC troubles.

Several feet ahead of me in the hall leading to the kitchen, the ceiling sagged with a great black bulge and the mass was growing. 

“Um!” I shouted and she stopped talking and followed my gaze up with a frown.

“Oh!” She wrung her hands and disappeared into the kitchen.

I stepped backwards. The ceiling was going to burst and there was something else in that black bubble. Something with limbs.

Melissa appeared back in hall with a large copper pot and a roll of paper towels and as soon as she did the ceiling gave.

A wave of wine cascaded down, and two heavy slaps came with it. The wine washed past my shoes and pooled against the door. 

I looked at the hall in shock. Lying in the wine like discarded dolls were her children. 

They were bloated and drowned; wine leaked from their ears and foamed mauve in their mouths. 

“I told you kids that was the wine room now.” She tsked and set the pot where a steady stream still poured from the ceiling. She dropped to her knees and began unspooling sheets of paper towels.

I was frozen in horror but slowly took my eyes from the kids to the hole in the ceiling. Above was a bathroom where wine ran down the side of the tub. 

“Bounty is the quicker picker upper!”

I looked back to Melissa. She soaked up wine with the paper towels and wrung them into the pot.

“The quicker picker upper!

The quicker picker upper!” 

She said in a frenzy but suddenly stopped to survey what was in front of her. 

“You know,” She smiled at me cunningly, her teeth somehow even blacker. “This is quite the mess.” 

Wine filled her daughter’s sinuses and steadily leaked from her lifeless eyes. 

She shuffled on her knees and cradled the child in her arms. 

When I saw Melisa’s eyes again, they were engulfed in that horrible scarlet. 

“Such a mess! I’m going to need some mommy juice for this one!” 

And then without hesitation she set her lips on the wine that dribbled down her daughter’s cheek, and [she drank.](https://www.reddit.com/r/thespookyplace/)

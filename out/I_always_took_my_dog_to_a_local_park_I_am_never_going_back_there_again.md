I got my dog, Lucy, as a puppy soon after a dear friend passed away. I named it after her. Over the years I grew extremely close to Lucy, so much I’d say that other than my parents and girlfriend, she was the single most important thing in my life.

One sunny afternoon I drove out of the city and took her for a walk and when we made a stop at the local park, I let her off her leash to play fetch with her little ball. Happy and healthy she ran back and forth catching and returning her ball and I rewarded her with ample treats.

At the far end of the park were bushes which her ball ended up in after one throw with a little too much force behind it. At a breakneck speed, she chased after it and dove headfirst into the bushes, the leaves rustling before I noticed just how silent the park had gotten.

The silence was broken by Lucy’s whimpering before she rushed out of the bushes. What I saw next turned my legs into jello and my heart was beating almost so fast it could have broken a rib.

Her fur was stained pinkish red, pain, fear, and dread clearly carved onto her face. When I rushed over to her, running faster than I had thought possible, I checked for and found two deep lacerations just below her neck and just above her shoulder blades. I picked her up while she was unrelentingly whimpering, and I ran to my car while my breathing sped up with each step I took.

I ran red lights and paid no mind to the speed limit, it is a wonder I did not get into an accident or was pulled over during my grand theft auto like drive to the vet.

Dashing into the building, staff came from all directions to help once they saw the serious injuries. They took Lucy and all I could do was wait. Those two and a half hours in the waiting room were torture, with a million thoughts of horrible doubts and uncertainties.

I felt like when my dear friend, Lucy, passed away all over again. Would I abruptly lose someone extremely precious to me once again, if my dog did indeed not make it, would I be okay? Would she have suffered for long? Would I ever be able to own another pet without it feeling like a betrayal towards Lucy?

And just what was the thing that did this to her?

The vet came out and took me aside. It was a close call, but she would live. They had to amputate a leg, it was just too damaged. He asked me how long she had been in the bushes.

“No more than half a minute,” I replied.

“Look, there’s no animal I know of that can cause injuries as severe as these in such a short time. It’s best to not return there. You’re not the first one to bring in an animal after injuries sustained in those bushes, and trust me, Lucy was lucky.”

He did not have to tell me twice. I am never going back to that park.

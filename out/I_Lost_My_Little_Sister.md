Every summer my town hosts a fair. It’s you’re average ferris wheels and rigged booth games. I waited in line at the ring toss booth holding my little sister’s hand. She looked up at me and smiled, this was only her second summer coming here. The cheesy music and bright colors were always things to look forward to throughout the year while waiting for the summer fair. One of the only times of year our whole town can come together that isn’t sad or important. I looked around. Children running with their friends, strings of tickets sticking out of their pockets. A little girl getting a giant bunny plush as a prize for winning a game, behind her a lit up ferris wheel. The cool breeze of a summer night wrapped everything together, nothing to worry about here. 
“Are you-” As soon as I started talking to her I looked down and noticed my little sister had vanished. So much for nothing going wrong. I spun around this way and that way trying to find her little brown braids and blue striped shirt. There was no sign of her anywhere.

“Trixie?” I tried calling her name, “Trixie!” 

no response. 

I stepped out of line and started scanning the area, maybe she saw a stuffed animal prize and she wanted to go see it? 

“Trixie!” I called her name again.

I started speed walking down the path between rows of booths. I saw a mom and her two sons sitting on a bench with cotton candy and went up to them. 

“Have you seen a little girl around? She’s about this tall with braids and a blue shirt?” I held my hand in front of my waist trying to show the mom how tall she was. 

She shook her head, “No, I’m sorry. I’ll keep a lookout.” 

I started freaking out, it was getting late and I told my mom that I would be home soon.
Maybe if I could… there! I saw a security guard standing by a prize booth with a plushie of some sort of rainbow panda duck hybrid. I ran up to him. 

“Sir I need help finding my little sister. She's about this tall, braids, a blue striped shirt.” I did the same thing I did with that mom. 

“When’s the last time you saw her?” he looked down at me. 

“In line at ring toss.” He nodded and spoke into his radio. A scratchy voice came out of it. 

“Nobody’s seen her. I’ll go look for her. Is your mom here with you?” 

I shook my head, “No.” 

He sighed “Well you should probably go tell her your sister’s missing. I'll try to find her, your family is the _____ family right?” I nodded, almost everybody in town knew each other. It shouldn’t take long before Trixie is found, a lot of people already know what she looks like and who she is. The security guard muttered something, I couldn’t hear what it was but he sounded confused.
I pulled out my phone to call my mom. A red battery popped up on the screen, it was dead. I turned around but the security guard was gone. I looked around for any of my friends. I saw the bright blonde hair of Sam and ran over to her. 

“Oh hey,” She turned to me. 

“Hi, do you have your phone on you? I need to call my mom.” I said. 

“Is it an emergency?” she was very picky about who touched her phone so I wasn’t surprised to hear this. 

“Yeah my little sister is missing I need to tell her.” Sam and her friends suddenly held confused expressions but she handed me her phone anyways. I rushed through it to the call app and punched in my mom’s number. 

Ring ring, “Hello?” My mom’s familiar voice came through the phone. 

“Mom I lost Trixie.” I blurted out, I was scared of how she was going to react. 

“What?” She replied. 

“I lost Trixie.” I repeated. There was a bit of silence and I was getting ready for my scared mother to yell at me when she said.. 

“Who’s Trixie?” 

I hesitated. 

“What do you mean who’s Trixie? She’s my little sister. Your youngest daughter.” 

My mom paused again for a bit. 

“You don’t have a little sister.”

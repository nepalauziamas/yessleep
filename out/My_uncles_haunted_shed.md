It was last thanksgiving, my immediate family went up to my uncles house for thanksgiving dinner, I had a cousin (15 f) Natalie, she was close in age to me so we got along well, she had a little sister (5 f) Hensley. My uncle used to have goats in his backyard, about 5 of them, and most of them would hang around my uncle’s shed, but a couple years later all of them died in the span of a week, one by one. After that my uncle moved out but a year later he moved back in with his wife and her kids.

Thanksgiving rolls around and Natalie and I decided to hangout in the shed, dinner comes around then after we were done eating we watched a movie Natalie and I, then the question “let’s go hangouts in the shed” I said yes. By this time night had fallen so we turned on our phone flash lights, then I her the gate inside the shed open, Natalie asked what made that noise and I said frantically “probably just the wind opening the gate” but I knew something much worse was going on.

Hensley came out to ask if she could play with us so we let her hangout in the shed. Then we all heard the screaming of a goat, we all looked at each other but Natalie said there were no goats living around, just horses. Then we heard it again, but this time something happened that shook me to my core. 

Hensley bursted out laughing, then Natalie suggested we go in side I nodded, as we were heading out we noticed Hensley sitting with a huge grin on her face, we both told her to come inside but she refused, so we went inside to tell Natalie’s mom, but she did nothing about it, we went back outside to see the most horrific thing we’d ever encountered,Hensley was gone, we looked every where in the back then went to check the shed again, what we saw was almost Indescribable, the shed door had closed and locked itself and there we saw above us was a mutilated goat hanging with blood dripping on the floor, it smelled awful, the worst part was as it seemed dead it screamed like what we heard before, then we took a couple steps to the back of the shed to really see what was going on, something was moving on the inside of its lower half tearing it’s way through the goats stomach, out slid her organs with a baby goat not fully matured, the goat hanging stoped screaming, we didn’t have time to see if the baby was even breathing. We new the door was locked but there was a little hatch on the side of the shed for chicken so we climbed our way through it, we were finally out side but we had to get over the chicken fence, I helped Natalie up then I climbed my way up and over. We rushed inside only to see Hensley eating a piece of pie, we had been to traumatized to talk or answer any questions for our family, we headed to Natalie’s room to calm down watch a movie a talked about what the hell happened.

We decided after 30 minutes of calming down we’d go outside again and check out the shed, we went out side as or family asked us if we were okay, we went out the back door to the shed and noticed the shed door was cracked and inch so we knew the door wasn’t locked anymore. We walked towards the shed and opened the door everything looked normal? 

We never got any answers to what happened that night and we have never spoken of it to anyone until now.

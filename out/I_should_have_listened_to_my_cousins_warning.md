Hello, I am not gonna tell you my name for privacy reasons and also my writing might not be the best. My story starts a few years ago when I was younger and my cousin used to babysit me and later my sister. My cousin loved horror watching, reading, listening to, even writing it. So it is no wonder that when ever I didn’t listen she would tell me the story of what she called las grapadoras de ojos. My family comes from Mexico and she claims this is my grand mother’s story that’s why it is in Spanish.

The story she would tell me went like this. Down in Mexico in my grandmother’s home town (not saying for privacy) there were monsters that would terrorize anyone under the age of 18. The monsters were called las grapadoras de ojos they were said to be about a foot tall a sickly green-gray color. They had long pointed noses and beards that would drag on the floor. Their arms were so long that their knuckles would drag on the floor as they ran. They had long slender fingers with sharp curved nails that would form a circle when they closed on their left hand. Their right has as bone thin but could move very quickly. They also kept a sewing needle under the flesh of their right hand. 

It is said that if anyone under 18 wasn’t in bed and asleep by 8:30pm they would target you. They would give you three warnings. The first is they would knock on either your bedroom’s door, walls, or window slowly with exactly one second between each knock, and with each knock they would say something in their deep raspy voice. “Ir…a…dormir…”. If you didn’t listen to their first warning and stayed up again you would get the second. Where they will go into your house and steal all of candy, fruit, and meat that was in your house. They would also leave you a note saying it a dormir. If you did it again you would get your last warning, they will go into your bed room and knock on the floor under your bed the same as your first warning.

Normally this was enough to get me to listen as I never wanted to know what would happen after their last warning. Until one day when I relized she probably just made it up because 8:30 was my bedtime and she was 18 so that’s why she was fine and not me. So, one day I decided that it was fake and didn’t listen and she told me the story again but I didn’t listen. Saying that they were just grumpy little men that wanted kids to go to sleep. 

My cousin looked at me amused. I thought she was impressed that I had figured it out. I could not have been more wrong. She looked me dead in the eye and told me that I had never happened after the third warning. Which being the brat I was told her to finish the story. 

She did.

She said that after the third warning if you didn’t listen you would hear stomping coming from the front door all the way to you room. Ir… a… dormir with every stop till they get to your door where it will stop and it will be silent for one minute.

Then in your left ear you will hear them whisper buenas noches. Then your eyes will close and you will fall asleep. You will never open your eyes again. As once you are asleep they will tear out your eyes with their left hand and eat them. They will then sew your empty eye sockets shut using the hairs from their breads as thread and you will never see again.

I was terrified but I covered it with anger asking what the hell was wrong with her, that she was go graphic, and belongs in an asylum. She looked at me annoyed and told me it was fine if I didn’t listen to her but it was almost 8:30 so if I want my first warning I should go to bed.

I was angry and scared so I listened and finally went to bed but didn’t go to sleep. I had an alarm clock in my room and I made sure to stay up till 9 that night. When I heard three knocks exactly one second apart and the raspy deep voice of a man from the door saying “ir… a… dormir…” with every knock.

I got angry and really scared and yelled at my cousin. To knock it off and that it wasn’t funny. She responded that it wasn’t her and I should be asleep. Her voice came from the couch it was close enough so we could hear each other but too far for me to not hear her run back. I then felt my heart drop to my stomach when I relized that her voice was too high it always has been. There was no way she could have made the voice.

After that I always went to bed and fell asleep by 8 I didn’t know if it was real or not but I didn’t want to risk it. That was till I was in high school where my cousin would baby sit my little sister because my parents didn’t trust her with me.

She would tell my sister the same story and it worked the same way. One day though I was watching a movie when my cousin told my sister the story again but, when she finished my sister turned to me and asked if it was true. Before I could answer my cousin told her it was and that I already had my first warning. She went to bed right away after that. That day I stayed up till my parents got home since my cousin said she wasn’t gonna fight me to go to bed because I’m not what she’s paid for anymore. She left after my parents came home and they forced me to go to bed at 10:30.

That morning I woke up to my parents fuming. They asked me what the note I left was and where the candy and meat they bought was. I was genuinely confused and kept denying it but they didn’t listen and punished me.Before they left my room they said that they were glad I was eating the fruit but I shouldn’t eat all it in one night. I went back to sleep ignoring there scolding. Then my sister starting crying scared saying that I was on my second warning before my eyes were gonna be eaten.

My parents tried to calm her down to explain when she told them about my cousin’s story they calmed her down and called my cousin. That was the last day she would baby sit my sister. Also the day my fate was sealed because I didn’t take her story seriously. 

The next time my parents needed a babysitter they asked one of my other cousins to baby sit. I forgot about the story because of it. One day I was staying up late working on homework. I had stayed up till 10 and then Decided to go to bed. I heard knocking on my floor that night. Three months later I closed my eyes for the last time. 

I stayed up because I was on a date with a girl I was dating at the time. I got home and stayed up till 9 then I went to bed. I then heard the stomping it was so loud and it’s rhythmic chanting all that way from my front door to my bed room and just like my cousin said it went silent for one minute. Then in my left ear I hear it’s voice. Buenas noches. I fell asleep and I haven’t seen since. 

I went to the hospital and they weren’t able to cut the stiches but from the various scans they did they said that it wouldn’t be much of a difference because my eyes weren’t in my head anymore. Nothing strange other than my eyes were gone and my eye lids were sewn together.

It’s been a couple years since then the cousin who told me the story committed suicide yesterday after what happened to me.

I think… I think the best thing for me know is to join her. I have only gotten enough sleep to stay alive since that night. She never said that they took your ability to sleep along with your eyes.

Now all of you that have read this know so at least my death won’t be in vein.

Good Night

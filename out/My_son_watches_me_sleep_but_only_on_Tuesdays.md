Hello, I am a mother (44f) of 3 children. 2 sons 12, 17, and a daughter 15. I love my kids and my husband (their father) died right after my youngest sons 2nd birthday. It was a few days after, actually. It shocked us all and it was very tragic. We owned a construction company and my husband would occasionally bring home his bulldozer to do some yard work (we were remodeling our backyard at the time). One night at 4am I had heard what had sounded like the bulldozer starting. I woke up so confused but figured my husband wanted to get an early start on the yard work and I quickly fell back asleep. When I woke back up it was 12pm. I don’t know how or why I slept that long but I did. I got up and went to make myself breakfast and my children were sitting on the couch watching their favorite program. 

I figured my husband had probably left to get himself some lunch but I asked the children where he was anyway just to confirm. They had no idea where he was and haven’t seen him all day. I decided to give him a ring and find out where he was. No answer. What the hell? He always answers. Even when busy he will answer and leave me on the phone until he’s finished. I go outside to the backyard only to find my the top half of my husbands body on the ground where the flower beds were being dug. I wanted to scream so badly but I couldn’t because I did not want my children to freak out. 

I called 911 and explained the situation and that I needed them right away. Ambulances and police officers showed up and the whole neighborhood came out to see the commotion going on. I was so devastated. My mother came to pick up my children so they wouldn’t  have see the horror that laid in their own backyard. The police finally found the other half of his body under the bulldozer and his death was ruled as an accident since there was no evidence of foul play. I opted to have him cremated since that would be the best option for the situation at hand. 

Fast forward to now, and the children still miss their father dearly but it’s been 10years and I did move on last year and found a wonderful man that really takes care of my children and I. My youngest is not fond of him, however, my other 2 children absolutely adore him. Since I’ve been bringing my new boyfriend around (47M) my youngest has been acting a bit weird. I’ve noticed every Tuesday, I wake up and my son is standing face to face with me, watching as I sleep. 

The first time I caught him was the first night my new partner had stayed the night. It was quite the shocker when I had opened my eyes to my 12yr old standing there, eyes locked onto my face. I jumped up and asked, “what’s the matter? Did you have a bad dream?” He answered no and that he missed “Baba”. Baba is what he called his dad when he was younger. I replied, “I’m sorry buddy, baba is always watching over us and he will forever be in our hearts but right now we need sleep for work and school in the morning.” I walked my son back to his room which he shared with older brother and  put him to sleep. 

Ever since this night, this is a strange occurrence on every Tuesday which happens to be the night my boyfriend stays to sleep. I tried therapy, I’ve tried talking to him about it during normal hours, nothing. He won’t budge on why he does this. 

He developed this thing to where he’s scared of his older siblings. He won’t go near them and refuses to be alone. They use to stay with him while I finished work or ran to the grocery store. He pleads to go everywhere with me now. My boyfriend thinks it’s some kind of related trauma to his father dying at such a young age but I have that “motherly feeling” that it’s something worse. I can’t even sleep at night anymore on Tuesday’s. I just stay up most of the night waiting for him to come in, so I can walk him back to his room. 

Come today, my youngest said the most off-putting thing to me in the car. “Do you think sissy and bub are evil?” EVIL? Why is my 12yr old asking if I think his older siblings are evil? What would make him think that? I responded with, “Why would you think they are evil?” He waited about 5 minutes before replying. Then said, “I just don’t think they’re good people. They always talk about how Tuesdays are the best days to say their prayers.” My family is not religious, so I’m not sure what prayers he is talking about. “Prayers? What prayers do they say?” My son unbuckles and comes to my ear and whispers, “The one’s praising the shadow men. That’s why I come to your room every night on Tuesdays. They told me if I don’t like it and don’t want to be a part of it, I should just leave. So I do. But they also told me if I tell you, they will do to me what they did to baba.”

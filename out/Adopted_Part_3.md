“What do you mean my sister moved in?” I stared at Luke, feeling the blood draining from my face.

He looked at me with concern.

“Are you okay, Alan? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”

I felt like it too. Thoughts whirled in my mind and refused to make sense. I grabbed the edge of the table for support and repeated my question through gritted teeth.

“Well, I found her in the kitchen last night, after I came in to get my vitamins,” he said, studying my reaction, “She said her name was Drew and that she’ll be staying with us for a while. I assumed you already knew?”

I slumped down onto the wooden chair and buried my face in my hands.

“Alan, what’s wrong?” he sounded alarmed, “She *is* your sister, right?”

My mouth felt as dry as a cotton ball.

“So, you-you can see her too?” I asked.

Luke stared at me, perplexed.

“Why wouldn’t I be able to see her?”

“Because…” I began, but then reconsidered. I didn’t want Luke to think I was crazy. I didn’t know him that well, so I couldn’t anticipate his reaction. He didn’t even know I had been adopted.

“Because?” he raised his eyebrows curiously.

“It’s nothing,” I said hurriedly, getting up from the table, “Where is she?”

“Drew?” Luke’s eyes were like saucers, “She said she’ll be staying on the couch in the living room.”

Apprehension flooded over me. What was the meaning of this? Had Mrs. Murphy been lying to me all these years? Luke had spoken about Drew as though she was a living, breathing being. So that meant she had to be real, right?

“Hiya,” a familiar voice said as I peeped through the living room door, “You can come in.”

Drew was sitting cross-legged on the couch and mashing the buttons on the remote control.

“I should think so,” I retorted, “It is my living room.”

We stared at the TV screen in silence.

“What are you doing here, Drew?” I finally asked.

She looked wounded.

“What’s that supposed to mean?” she cried, pulling her knees to her chest, “I haven’t seen you in years!”

“We’ve been over this,” I said sternly, “I just want a normal life.”

“Is that what this is?” she sniffled, “You even got a new roommate.”

I couldn’t help myself.

“How come he can see you?” I blurted out.

She looked indignant.

“I told you, Al. Mrs. Murphy has a screw loose. She ripped us apart, filling your head with all that rubbish.”

I didn’t answer. Mrs. Murphy had been very patient and generous with me. I felt forever in her debt.

“Well, you can’t stay here,” I told her.

I knew Drew’s short temper only too well, but I wasn’t going to be swayed this time.

“It’s only for a little while,” she pleaded, “You can’t throw me out.”

I returned to my room with a lump in my throat. It had been years since I’d last seen Drew and here she was, watching TV in my living room as if nothing had ever happened. With shaky fingers, I picked up my phone and dialed the only number I knew by heart.

“Hello?” Mrs. Murphy’s voice came through the line, “Alan?”

“Yes, it’s me,” I assured her, “I have to ask you something.”

“What is it?”

I took a deep breath.

“Is-is Drew real?” I shut my eyes, anticipating the response.

Mrs. Murphy was silent and for a moment I wondered if we had been disconnected.

“What’s wrong, Alan?” there was an edge to her voice.

“I- can you just answer my question?” I could feel droplets of sweat forming on my upper lip.

She sighed.

“Darling, you know Drew is your middle name. What’s happened?”

I summarized the morning’s events the best I could, stumbling over my words and gesturing wildly with my arms.

“Luke told me this morning,” I said, “And he can see her too!”

Mrs. Murphy hesitated.

“Perhaps I could come see you tomorrow afternoon?” she said, “We could talk more about it then.”

I nodded into the receiver.

“You can, but Luke will probably be having one of his weekly get-togethers in the evening.”

“That’s alright,” she said, “I’ll just drop by.”

Mrs. Murphy arrived at about 6 P.M. the following evening. I had warned Luke and his buddies not to get too rowdy, as I didn’t want her getting the wrong impression. He had agreed and ushered all his friends into the kitchen, letting us have some privacy. Drew had refused to leave, however, and loitered in the living room, so I led Mrs. Murphy into my bedroom, shutting the door behind us.

“How are you feeling?” Mrs. Murphy asked as soon as we sat down.

“I’m alright,” I said, as a muffled pop came from the kitchen, followed by a subdued cheer, “Sorry about the noise, Luke’s having a party.”

Mrs. Murphy nodded, studying me carefully.

“Luke is the roommate you told me about?” she asked.

“Yeah,” I said, fiddling with my pocket zipper, “He moved in about a month ago.”

Mrs. Murphy took a deep breath.

“Listen, Alan, the reason I came over is to check if you’re okay,” she said, “You sounded awfully distraught over the phone.”

I stared at her, unsure of what to say.

“Have you been taking your medication?” her tone was serious.

I winced. There was a long, tense silence.

“I haven’t,” I admitted.

Mrs. Murphy’s face fell.

“But everything was fine, up until yesterday, I promise!” I said, trying to salvage the situation, “This was the first time I have seen Drew in years!”

I heard the kitchen door open and the shuffle of feet in the hallway. A knock on my bedroom door signaled that the kitchen was no longer occupied.

“It’s alright, they’re just leaving,” I chuckled.

But Mrs. Murphy looked paler than ever.

“Alan,” she whispered.

“What’s the matter?” I said, a chill crawling up my spine.

Her eyes were brimming with tears as she reached for her phone.

“There’s nobody there.”

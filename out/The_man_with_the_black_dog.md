I’m not a reddit poster, not even really a reddit user. But I know enough about spooky internet lore to know that this is the place to come for answers. Maybe this is just the place to tell spooky stories that could be real- I’m honestly not too sure but either way you guys have probably read enough to be able to give me some answers. 

SKIP to the next paragraph to read the story. I have to add some filler because the first time I posted it was removed because this story didn’t meet the word requirement. So I apologize for all the extra text in the beginning. I don’t really know much about reddit or how this works- I’m just trying to get some answers about what I just witnessed. Skip to the next paragraph to read the story! I hope you all have a good day and I hope my night ends up being okay after this…

I’m watching my friends dog for the weekend. She recently moved to a new apartment with a big park behind her street. We live in a large city, so it’s nice to have some greenery and get to walk around in nature. I go to take Lou (my friends dog) out, but it starts down pouring. I checked the weather and the storm is predicted to last the night. Alas- we venture into the park. Mind you it’s around 7pm so light out still, but really rainy. It’s not a great neighborhood that she lives in, but I’ve lived in a worse part of town the last four years and so I’m not usually scared of running into other people or trouble. I especially wasn’t super worried because it was pouring so I doubted anyone would be in the park and plus I’m accompanied by my big scary friend Lou. 

We get to the edge of the park still on the side walk and both of us come to a pause. About half a football field away is a pond with a dirt path that circles it. I look up and notice a man walking down the path with his dog. Something that should’ve been very normal. But something just felt off. I can tell he’s very tall and skinny in stature, dressed in dark clothes, and was carrying a big black umbrella that was covering his head. Ahead of him was his big black dog. I felt like I was frozen just watching him go along the path and walk down along the pond. It wasn’t until he began to circle around the other side that I kind of snapped out of it. It had felt like no time had passed, yet it must’ve since he had just walked about half the pond. I look down and Lou is glued to my side also just starring. Now Lou is a 140lb mutt who doesn’t scare easily and even he was spooked. 

We both hurried home and are now safe inside as I write this. I know this isn’t much of a story but it spooked me enough to come on here and ask… what did I just witness??? 

I’m not a very religious person but if someone told me that’s what the devil looked like I’d believe them. Or maybe the grim reaper. I hope it wasn’t some omen of some kind. My friend is coming back in an hour or so, I’m itching to get as far away as I can from here. Even as I’m writing this Lou keeps peaking his head out the window and won’t sit down. I hope she hurries up and gets home quick. 

If anyone has any ideas please let me know. Thanks Reddit.

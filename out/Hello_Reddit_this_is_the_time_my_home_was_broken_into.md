Some of you may call me a liar for this, but I need to say something.

Also, after telling my story I'm sure I won't come back here as I well expect accusations about this event.

My name is Elias, I'm 27 and I'm from Orange County, CA. When I was 7 me and my family moved to this small town in Arizona called "New River" and we stayed there until the incident happened.

A bit of info about New River: It's about a half hour from Phoenix by car, and it's quite a peaceful town. Look; I don't want to make it seem like New River is some kind of hell-hole. It's such an amazing place to raise a family and this is just an experience that I myself had to bear.

So, let's get back to the story. I was around 13 years old and the year was 2008. At that time it was all fun and games (retardation, as well) and I was just chilling at home playing Sonic Riders. My parents had informed me that they were going out to dinner and they would be back in about 2 hours. I forgot to mention that the time was around 9 P.M. I was thinking that I would chill out, play my game, eat some pizza, the usual.

So they leave and I'm sitting alone on my beanbag chair attempting to get past one of the stages in that game. I eventually got hungry so I went down stairs to heat up some pizza. Also, I had a dog at this time named Milo. Milo was a good boy so whenever he barked we were always on high alert. Low and behold he was barking at someone or something. I opened the blind just a little to see what was there.

Nothing was outside.

So I heated up my pizza and decide to chill out on the couch and watch something on T.V. Milo curled up next to me and I swore that I had dozed off after eating. I felt like I woke up about 30 minutes later (more or less) but something was off. I heard a clicking at the door. I knew it wasn't my parents because neither of them would be struggling to get inside the house.

Someone was picking the lock.

God, that noise brings chills to spine even to this day. Looking at Milo, I saw he wasn't barking. Instead, his head was hanging low, tail tucked, ears back with a low growl coming out of him. He knew what was happening. I jumped up, quivering with fear and ran upstairs. Milo was a good boy who always followed his owners. In this case he followed me upstairs. Man, that must've been the fastest I've ever ran in my life. Once I got into my room I shut the door and locked it tight. I pull my beanbag chair in front of the door for extra protection and hid under my bed.

I heard boots. He was inside the house.

I didn't have a phone on me at the time. The only phone we had was a home phone and it was downstairs. At this point, as embarrassing as it is, I had pissed myself in fear. I was in full-blown panic mode. I don't exactly remember but I think I whispering prayers to myself. I heard him coming up the stairs, and right now as I'm writing this I am almost in tears. I felt his boots thumping on the floor. He instead went into my parents room all the way down the hall to the right of me. The stairs were to the left I believe and all I recall is slowly creeping down those stairs out into the street (with Milo) and running to the neighbors house. I came to their door in tears, sobbing telling them everything that had happened. Man, the nicest people I've ever encountered. A little old couple who once had children of their own. Unfortunately now they've passed away, but I'll never forget them. 

They brought me inside and sat me down while the husband called the police. I remember Milo was giving me kisses and laying down with me. Around 30 minutes later the police arrived, but the man was gone. I can't remember if they ever found him but all that mattered was that I was safe. My mom and dad hugged me tight and said "We love you, our brave little guy!"

And that's my story, almost 13 years later, and I'm still that brave little guy.

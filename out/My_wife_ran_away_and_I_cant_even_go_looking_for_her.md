Like most men in my country, I (48M) spend most time at work, while my wife takes care of the house. She always seemed happy about it, knowing I come back home with enough money for her needs and wants. Many people would call me "sexist", but I believe what we are doing is having a healthy, balanced, relationship. After working for 8 hours everyday, I don't have the energy to mop floors or cook a fancy dinner.


My wife never complained about anything, that's why I'm so shocked. She ran away, not even thinking about our 3 month old, who is in terrible health. Without his mothers milk, he won't survive a week. I'm already preparing to order everything needed for the poor boy's funeral.


I never overworked, always came home at the same time, but today I decided to do things differently. This one time, and it destroyed everything. Our automatic fence always opened at the same time, so I guess that's when my wife escaped...


The thing is, I believe I'll never get the chance to see her again, nor look for her. I have no idea where the poor woman even is, considering she had no chance of going back to her parents house. They accepted our relationship and she hated them herself, I never understood why.


Just the day before we both happily looked through our wedding photos, mentioning how sad her sister looked in every photo. Her sister was an amazing woman, so as much as I may have wanted to, I didn't say anything bad about the tears in her eyes during the happiest day of my life.


But enough time to cry about the past, when I'm supposed to cry about the present.


The maid told me everything through more tears of hers, crying to me and apologizing. I can't blame her,  can I?


Well, for that. I can totally blame her for the phone call to the police she made....


I know she was close to my wife. Probably closer than I ever will. They have known each other since childhood, so it explains itself quite well... But what did I do wrong?


When I was standing above her, with a knife in my hands she continued to bawl about all the videos on my computer, but what I saw in it was videos that reminded me of my wife. Nothing wrong about it, right…? The love of my dreams was gone, because of a friend of hers that thought escaping was better for her.


Why was she so naive? Women, as my father, rest in peace, would say.


The sirens are ringing, while she's laying on the floor, naked and dead. Atleast, at the last moment I managed to enjoy her frail body. Maybe she felt sorry for her sister, and thought this way she would help the poor girl.


But now, I had to lose 2 10-years olds from my life. My lovely wife, and the maid I saw as family.

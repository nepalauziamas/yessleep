One thing I didn’t mention before, because it sounds crazy, is that before I felt it next to my feet I heard it when it was on the floor and I can just assume it jumped because of the sound I heard. But it didn’t land right away and I can almost swear I heard wings flutter, I know how it sounds but, trust me, but hear me out please, and maybe you can help me find out what that thing is.

In my last post of this story I mentioned I was going to see a tarotist, that’s why I’m mentioning this now because of what she told me. I’m not sure if it’s true but here it goes, according to her that thing was a gargoyle, she said that because of my mental state my energy was really weak and this creature was trying to feed off it by attacking me. Because of what I heard that day it kinda makes sense but I did a little research and gargoyles are supposed to be protectors and to ward off evil spirits, so was it or was it not a gargoyle?

I talked a little bit about this with my sisters, they like the supernatural and all that stuff but they don’t know much so they say that it might be a gargoyle just because it doesn’t sound like anything else. They told me that I should do a little meditation before bed just in case, to protect myself. Basically I have to close my eyes and imagine a white pyramid around my bed, I forgot the reason why it has to be a pyramid but I have been feeling safer than before.

Although my dreams keep being very weird and kinda scary, someone is always chasing me and it’s always night, I very rarely see daylight in my dreams. I’m going to describe the last one I wrote down so you can judge for yourself.

Like in any other dream I ‘wake up’ in the middle of something, and I say wake up because that’s how it feels inside the dream. And it doesn’t matter how nonsense the situations are, I never realize I’m dreaming, ever, until I wake up. So in this particular dream I ‘woke up’ in the middle of the forest on some train tracks, I felt very weak and could barely move, I stayed there for a while and when I was getting up I say that some sort of creatures were coming my way, they looked like animals but not really, and behind them were a bunch of people riding motorcycles, they all seemed frightened. I don’t think they saw me, they were busy trying to hide. Once they were all deep inside the forest I heard a noise, it’s difficult to describe but it sounded like a bunch of things were happening at once, and all I could see was a large shadow in the sky. I was frozen in place, I couldn’t get up or scream or anything and the sound seemed to get closer and closer and suddenly I felt a pair of hand dragging me to a nearby bush it was one of the motorcycle riders he was saying something but I couldn’t hear anything and when the noise was closer I woke up, in real life, or at least I think this is real life, but lately I’ve been wondering if my dream life is my real life, are you guys real? God, I really hope so.

I already researched everything I could online, I found nothing so I guess I’ll try to find answers in my dreams.

The white pyramid meditation has kinda been working, I haven’t seen anything since I started doing it. And yet I still feel a strong presence at home, like I’m being watched but I try to ignore it as much as possible.

Last weekend we went to a little house that my parents have in the forest so it's basically off grid. There’s just one big room, a dry bathroom and an outdoor kitchen. My parents always stay in the room and my sisters and I stay in a tent just outside the house.

The day we got there was quiet, we went to the river and had a picnic. At night my father built a bonfire, we sat around there drinking coffee which for me it’s the only time they let me drink it that late. We were just talking amongst ourselves when one of the twins, Laura, pulled away to look for a cell phone signal because she wanted to text her friend. We didn’t pay much attention to that until she screamed and came back running toward us.

She said that she saw a tall figure with long limbs running past her, my mother immediately said that it was most certainly a cow but come on, it couldn’t have been, mainly based on what Laura said. I think she was just trying to make us feel safe, but it was too late, I was already terrified.

We went back to the bonfire and my other sister, Paula, was telling us a story about forest creatures, and that whatever Laura had seen, it was probably one of them. My mother said it was nonsense and went to bed soon after followed by my father. He told us to make sure to put off the bonfire completely before going to sleep. Paula continued with her story about forest creatures and said that normally they are the protectors of the forest and that they were probably just visiting making sure we weren’t doing any damage. She seemed to be really into that because she told us that we should put a peace offering to them.

“I read somewhere that they like candy and sweets so we should probably leave some for them just to make sure.” She said very sure of herself.

So we did that, we put a whole package of cookies, some gum and a bar of chocolate.

They seemed to fall asleep very quickly but I couldn’t, even with the meditation. I just stayed there with my eyes wide open staring at the top of the tent. I don’t know how much time went by. I just drifted off until I heard movement outside. It sounded like something was moving through the bushes, I was terrified but I just made myself think that it was probably a coyote or something like that. After a while I heard movement again but closer and whatever it was, it moved really close to the tent and it was sniffing the tent, (us?). I stayed very still and after a while it went away.

I fell asleep eventually, no dreams, and in the morning I heard Paula’s voice.

“I knew it.” She said with a little too much excitement. I went outside to see what was going on.

“What is it?” I asked her, still feeling very sleepy.

“They came, and I think that what I read online was true.” She said while holding one of the cookies.

“Which is?” I said, very confused, because if the cookie was still there, doesn’t it mean that they didn’t take the offering?

“Okay, I don’t believe it! Look, they are beings from another dimension so they can't actually eat our food, at least not like us, and the reason they like sweets is because of the smell, so they eat the flavour.”

I was still so confused, maybe because I wasn’t fully awake yet but I wasn’t processing the information. She seemed to have noticed that so she put half the cookie in my mouth, and it didn’t taste like anything.

“See? I ate one before you woke up. They don’t taste like anything.”

“Okay, but you don’t think that maybe they are faulty.” I said not actually believing my words.

“Seriously? And what about the chocolate? Because it tastes the same, flavourless.”

“I don’t know, I want to believe it but it sounds insane.”

“More insane than whatever visited you the other day, you should try believing this stuff and maybe you can find the answers that you are looking for.” She said while she walked toward the kitchen, where my parents were already cooking.

Lunch went by very quietly, we didn’t mention the offering to our parents, mainly because mom doesn’t believe in any of it. They were talking about an upcoming wedding and some other stuff, I wasn’t really paying attention.

On our way back I had Paula’s voice inside my head. I obviously believe in this kind of stuff, because of everything that has happened to me, but… I can’t deny that sometimes I think it is all inside my head.

And I feel like I can’t keep up, because when I’m focused on finding the answer to something that happened, another thing happens and I’m left feeling like I’m going insane. Maybe I should surrender to the darkness.

This summer I graduated from high school, and because I don't yet know what I want to study or if I want to keep studying at all, my parents decided to send me with one of my aunties. My other aunties and uncles call her ‘bruja’ which is witch in Spanish, so I guess I’ll find out if that’s true. I hope she can help me. Her name is Agnes. She lives in a very secluded area deep in the mountains in a very small community of people fed up with society. My parents always call her a hippie but not in a rude way but rather an endearing one.

She used to be a nurse, but one day she just quit, and didn't even wait for her retirement. She never had kids or a partner.

Recently she's sick so she needs the help and I could use the fresh air. I don't talk to her much, but she sounded very excited when we asked her about me going to live with her for a while.

Right now it seems that everything is not connected, and it might not be... I don't even know what I'm saying anymore, I just feel like I lost so much of me that now I'm just an empty carcass of what I used to be.

And worst of all I started hearing voices, I’ve been meaning to tell my parents but one; I don’t think they are going to be able to help me, and two; I don’t want them to worry.

I just hope everything gets better once I get to my auntie’s. Because the voices have been saying one thing over and over again, to "please just leave the lights off".

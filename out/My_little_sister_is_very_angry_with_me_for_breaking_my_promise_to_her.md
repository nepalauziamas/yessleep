When my youngest sister Ava was two, twin lumps formed in her back, near her shoulder blades. Our parents couldn’t afford to take her to the doctor, not when they were both making minimum wage and had me and our three other siblings to take care of, so they resolved to cut their losses. They surmised that Ava had a type of cancer, and that she’d soon be departed from this world. It’d be one less mouth to feed, anyhow. I was the oldest, at nine, and I was used to taking care of my siblings. I was ashamed to admit that I was initially a bit relieved, because I’d have one less person to look after, though that attitude quickly faded once I took one look at Ava’s devastated face and the guilt set in. 

Ava cried for the next two years of her life, blubbering about the pain in her back growing and growing. She couldn’t wear shirts as the lumps grew bigger, and became yellow in color, sticking out from her otherwise tan skin. By that point, I felt sorry for her, and I’d take her to ice cream with the money I’d saved up from mowing lawns. The lumps grew from her back, large and bulbous, and she began to dominate the space on the single mattress in our room, where our siblings slept. 

“She’s gonna die soon, right, Esperanza?” Fernando, the second oldest, whispered to me one night, the night before Ava’s fifth birthday. “She’s in so much pain, and she’s taking up so much room in the bed anyway with her lumpy back.”

“Shut up,” I hissed back, as Ava sniffled at his words. 

“You both shut up,” Yvette and Jorge, the twins, muttered in reply. 

Ava burrowed closer to me and I felt her tears soak into my pajamas.

The next morning, on Ava’s fifth birthday, our parents were already gone for the day, and I woke up to get my siblings ready for school. As soon as Ava awoke, the lumps on her back shifted, before they burst with a sickening *pop*, and blood sprayed from her back. The warm flecks landed on my face, and I heard Yvette, Jorge, and Fernando crying out, rushing to hide behind me. 

I wiped the blood that’d splattered on my face to focus on Ava. A pair of beautiful wings with golden feathers had sprung from her back, taking up nearly the whole room space. The golden wings were flecked with blood, though I found that it didn’t take from their beauty in the slightest. 

Ava cried, as her wings drooped around her. She ran towards me, her wings knocking the clothes I’d laid out the night before off to the side, and catching on the blanket that covered our bed. “Esperanza,” she moaned, crying and hugging me. “What’s happening to me? Help me!” 

I felt a warmth as Ava’s wings encompassed us both, and I froze, for once, at a total loss. 

I turned to Fernando at last. “Call Mom and Dad. Their numbers are on the fridge.” 

Fernando nodded and scampered off, while Yvette and Jorge both began to circle Ava curiously. 

Jorge plucked a feather from Ava’s wings, causing her to yelp. 

“Hey!” I snapped. “Hands to yourself! She isn’t a toy, so be nice!”

Jorge nodded sheepishly, offering the feather back to Ava, who dislodged herself from my arms to take it. I admittedly felt bad for snapping. I had to remember that Yvette and Jorge were only eight. They were smart for their ages too, Jorge especially so. He was supposed to be in some gifted kid program at school, but Mom and Dad said they couldn’t afford for him to go. I still tried to take him to the library, though it was a hassle with the rest of our siblings tagging along. Fernando found the library boring, Ava hated being seen with lumps on her back, and Yvette had a tendency to wander. 

Fernando came back into the room, saying that our parents weren’t going to leave work for a prank, and would return at their normal times. I forced a lump of frustration down my throat with a sigh. I couldn’t drop the ball right now, with all of my siblings giving me expecting looks and Ava’s wings creating a golden, glaring change in her life. 

We all resolved to stay home from school that day, as I cleaned the blood off of our room, and I had Yvette help me clean Ava, and I tasked Fernando to make her the best birthday treat he could manage, which ended up being some leftover sweet bread our mom bought a while ago and a bit of pudding from the fridge. I couldn’t really blame him for that one, seeing as the alternative looked to be a kraft cheese sandwich on wonderbread, and Ava liked it anyway. The cheese sandwiches ended up going to Yvette and Jorge, while Fernando and I resolved we’d try to eat later, when mom and dad got home. 

“What if Ava needs to eat more, because of the wings or something?” Fernando looked worried. 

I shrugged, trying to seem as casual as possible. “Then we’ll figure something out. It won’t be a big deal.” 

I chose to ignore the way Fernando’s face seemed to fall even more. That amount of worry didn’t suit a ten year old face, especially not Fernando’s. Back when it was just the two of us, I could always make him laugh by just pulling faces at him. 

As our other siblings had come along and grown to demand my attention and our parents worked more and more, he’d smiled less and less. I guess I had less time to make funny faces anyhow. 

We went out to the backyard, where Ava’s cleaned wings dried in the sunlight. 

“You want to fly, Ava?” I asked. 

“Can she?” Fernando asked, raising an eyebrow. 

“She’s a bird!” Yvette said, smacking his arm. “Of course she can!” 

“It won’t be easy,” Jorge said, pushing up his crooked glasses. “Baby birds have to learn by being pushed out from the nest.” 

Ava whimpered, holding my hand. “I…I don’t wanna get pushed, Esperanza.” 

“That’s okay,” I reassured her. “You don’t have to fly yet if you don’t want to, I promise.” 

“Promise?” Ava held out her pinky. 

I wrapped mine around hers with a smile. “Promise. Maybe someday, you will, though. That’d be fun, right?” 

Ava gave me a small smile and nodded. 

When our parents finally got home, their worn faces went slack at the sight of Ava. The rest of us stood off to the side as our parents poked and prodded at Ava, who squirmed uncomfortably. I think it was the first time I could remember them holding her. 

Our father laughed, after a long period of silence. “We’re rich!” 

My mother’s eyes pricked with tears. “Finally! We’ve been given a blessing from God!” She hugged Ava, while our father ran from the room and picked up the phone. 

An hour later, two people in suits came to our door. I saw my reflection in the sunglasses of the tall man, and I realized I hadn’t even washed Ava’s blood from my face. 

“Here she is,” my father said, pushing Ava forward. “Our little miracle.” 

The suits roved around Ava, until one, the woman, plucked a feather from her wings, and she let out a cry as another one tugged at her wings, as if trying to pry them off. 

“Hey!” Jorge shouted. “She’s not a toy!” 

I nodded, stepping forward as well. “Don’t hurt her.” 

My mother glared at both of us, even reaching to drag Jorge back by the collar of his shirt. “Don’t ruin this for us,” she hissed. “This family may finally be moving up in the world.” 

Jorge fell silent, as did I. I felt a degree of shame as I did, imagining a world where I could have my own bed, and be independent from the needs of my siblings. 

The tall suit knelt by Ava, and lifted her foot, attaching a shackle to her ankle. “We’d love to take her in for further testing. An anomaly like this is extremely rare, and we’ll pay you handsomely for it.” 

My father nodded. “The amount we agreed upon, right?” 

The suit nodded. “Yes, of course.” 

He stepped forward, and opened a briefcase filled with money. 

“Holy shit,” Fernando muttered, eyeing the wads of cash. “How much even is that?!” 

“More than I’ve made in my life,” my father crowed, reaching for the cash. 

The tall suit snapped the briefcase shut. “Not before you sign it over to us.”

“Her name is Ava,” I said, an icky feeling taking over my chest, even at the sight of all the money. 

“Right,” the tall suit said in a monotone voice. “Ava.” 

“Come along, Ava,” the other suit, a woman with red lips, said. “We’re going to get you all situated.” 

Her tone was honey sweet, but I didn’t like the way her nails seemed to dig into Ava’s skin. Ava gave me a pleading look as the woman gave her arm a gentle tug. 

“Esperanza, I don’t wanna go,” she said, outstretching her hand. “I wanna stay here.” 

My father shot me a glare as I stepped towards her. “You’re not in charge here, Esperanza. Go stand with your siblings.” 

Anger began to bubble in my throat. I’d been in charge for years, looking after the siblings my parents neglected, especially Ava, the one they’d written off from the beginning. Now, right when it mattered, I was no longer in charge. 

“It’s okay,” the tall suit placated, his voice unwavering. “She’ll be put in a state-of-the-art facility with access to education and an open yard where we’ll teach her to fly.” 

Ava’s eyes widened. “I don’t wanna fly yet!” She tried to wrench her hand from the red-lipped woman, but to no avail. “Esperanza!” 

My mother grabbed my hand, shaking her head. I could see the desperation in her tired face. “Please. This is our only chance to have a better life. For all of us.” 

I looked from Ava, her panicked face flecked with tears, back to the rest of my siblings, standing together, eyeing me. Jorge’s glasses were still worn and crooked, and probably not even his prescription anymore. Yvette was wearing a shirt that used to be mine, and it was stained with paint. It was one of her better ones. I didn’t even know what kinds of things she liked. She’d always worn my stuff, and none of her own. Fernando twitched, his lanky limbs tapping and fidgeting as he clutched his stomach. He wasn’t getting any smaller, and he’d started to take on some responsibilities with me, in making lunches and cleaning our home. 

I was always so tired, and worried. I had to monitor everything about my siblings, even what I said and how I acted at home and school. I had to make sure they were safe at night, locking our doors and staying up until they’d gone to sleep, to make sure we’d be alright. I had to worry about them even when I wasn’t with them at school; I had to cook and clean for them. I didn’t want Fernando to start feeling that way too. 

I felt a stinging sensation in my eyes as I looked down at the floor, away from Ava, and stepped back with the rest of my siblings. 

“Esperanza,” Ava cried, as I heard the chain on her ankle being dragged across the floor, further and further from us. “Esperanza, please.” 

I looked up, and made the mistake of meeting Ava’s gaze. Her eyebrows crinkled together into a thin line, marred with betrayal, as tears streamed down her cheeks. “You promised!” Ava howled, as she was dragged away. “You promised, you promised, you promised, you promised!” 

Fernando leaned against me, already taller than me, and he gave my hand a squeeze. Yvette shuddered and covered her ears as Ava was led away, still howling at me. Jorge looked at me, and I could see a quiet resignation in his eyes, though the way he looked at me had my stomach in knots. 

“You did the right thing,” my mother whispered to me, as the head suit handed my father the briefcase of money. 

I didn’t reply, instead focusing on blinking back the tears that were threatening to fall from my eyes. 

The next few months were hectic, as Mom and Dad both quit their jobs and we moved to a beautiful, expensive house in an affluent neighborhood. It was a three story home, with a state of the art kitchen, dining area, and family room on the first floor. The second floor had my parents’ master bedroom and three other bed and bath units, which went to my siblings. 

Yvette, it turns out, had developed a love for very feminine aesthetics. I was surprised to see her quickly begin to buy blouses and skirts when we went shopping with our mom, and decorate her room with posters of magical girls and cases of dolls. 

“I didn’t know you liked this stuff,” I remarked, after seeing her attempt to put her hair up in two ponytails with glitter hair bands. 

“Well you don’t,” Yvette shrugged, “And I had to wear all your stuff and have your things.” 

“You should’ve told me,” I responded. “I would’ve saved up to get you something.” 

Yvette giggled. “Well, now you don’t have to!” 

I nodded, though I bit back a lump of guilt as I wondered if Ava would’ve also liked this stuff. 

My room was the only thing on the third floor, a spacious nook with a circular window that hosted a beautiful ocean view. I’d declared ownership of the room as soon as I’d laid eyes on it, and none of my siblings objected. I put up posters of my favorite band, and spread out on the massive bed my parents bought for me. 

It was nice, but I had an inkling as to why I’d gotten everything I’d wanted without much fuss, considering what I’d given up.  

A year later, we got a letter from the government, with an update on Ava. The letter said she was safe, and doing well, learning basic educational skills with experts, and being treated well. The letter referred to her as “the avian” the entire time, citing her as a new species of human. They hadn’t gotten to the bottom of what exactly had caused her wings to sprout yet, but offered us a chance at visitation before she was supposed to be shipped off to a lab in DC. 

My parents threw the letter away, citing it as old business. They had to focus on school anyway, seeing as they’d both enrolled in college to pursue their educational passions. I didn’t know if I felt happy for them or resentful that they were leaving again. Either way, they’d decided we were old enough to be independent, now that we were in a better neighborhood and had more access to buy our way into programs in school or even get videogame equipment to pass the time. They bought us groceries, but oftentimes, I still made dinner. 

I fished the letter from the garbage in the middle of the night, a sense of guilt spurring me onwards. Jorge, down for a midnight snack, saw me do it, but said nothing, instead fixing his brand-new glasses and going back to his room. 

I ended up taking the bus down to the town the facility was located in. It was secluded and woodsy, with the facility sticking out as one of the few buildings in the area, apart from a gas station and a convenience store. The facility itself was a stark contrast, a large, dome-shaped building with a silver sheen around it. Looking at it made me weary, seeing as it was a two mile walk from the bus stop and I was already tired from the four hour ride, but I was determined to see Ava. I didn’t even have to talk. All I had to do was see, just to make sure she was okay, and the letter was telling the truth. I made it to the building right on time. As I stood in front of it, I could see that the silver sheen came from the large, dome-like structure that wrapped itself around the building, like a steel embrace. I showed the suit by the door the letter, and I was ushered to a cold waiting room. 

Ava came out to greet me, inside the hall, flanked by the red-lipped woman and the tall suit from the beginning. They introduced themselves as Ava’s handlers, and talked about how great she was doing in her studies, how she’d adapted well to a nutrition plan they’d put her on, and how she loved it here. 

Ava didn’t say a word, instead staring daggers into the floor, her wings draped around her like a shield, covering her arms. Ava’s hair had been cut short, about down to her ears, and she wore a hospital gown, the one with an open back so her wings could fit. She did look considerably less skinny than she’d been before, so I supposed the nutrition plan part was probably true. 

I tilted my head, trying to meet her gaze. “Ava, do you want to hear about Mom and Dad?” 

She shook her head. 

“How about Fernando?”

Another shake. 

“Yvette?” 

Another shake. 

“Jorge?” 

Another shake. 

“Well, how about me?” 

Ava’s gaze snapped up, and she met my eyes as muted anger rolled off her in waves. “No.” 

“Ava,” I said, hearing my own voice waver. “I just want to see if you’re okay.” 

“She’s alright,” the red-lipped woman said. 

“Peachy,” tall suit added. “She’s been great with flying. We’ve got a whole facility, just for her.” 

The tall suit and red-lipped woman stood up together, Ava following suit, like a marionette on a string. They motioned for me to follow them outside, to a grassy area, with little perches scattered throughout, at various heights. The silver bars continued, even out here, so that the dome covered parts of the sky, making it look like a broken puzzle. 

“Show her,” the red-lipped woman said, nudging Ava forward with a gentle tone. “Show her what you can do, Avian.”

Ava unfurled her wings, and they glowed golden in the afternoon sunlight, making her shine. I now could see the numerous bandages covering her arms and legs, like a small army of plaster and cloth had invaded her skin. The tall suit got out a pocket watch and clicked it as Ava flapped her wings and lifted off from the floor, flitting from one perch to another as she rose further and further up towards the top of the dome. 

Ava reached the top in what seemed like a blink, her wings flapping behind her. She looked up towards the sky, and touched the bars, ripping and prying on them before the head suit sighed and opened the pocket watch to reveal another button that he pressed, causing Ava to spasm and shake, before she flew down, without another word, landing on the grass. 

Her face was covered in sweat, and her limbs shook. Her wings drooped, and their shine illuminated her determined, resentful expression. 

“Doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting the same result,” the red-lipped woman said with a small laugh, “That’s the definition of insanity.” 

I felt sick to my stomach. “What did you guys just do?” 

The tall suit shrugged. “Nothing you can prove, considering the avian is classified knowledge. Now, the visiting hour is over. Say your goodbyes and get out.” 

I clenched my teeth, and my palms curled to fists by my side. “She’s my sister. You can’t hurt her like that. I’m taking her back.” 

“You’re not in charge of her,” the red-lipped woman chided, shaking her head with a smile. “You’re a minor, and her guardian signed her over to us, remember?” 

“I remember,” Ava muttered darkly, and she glared at me. “Being with you wouldn’t be any better. At least here, I get food and they don’t promise me anything.” 

“Ava, this isn’t right,” I tried, pleading with her. “I’m so sorry, but the others needed the money and I couldn’t deny them the opportunity to have a good life. I-” 

“-I hope you’re happy,” Ava said, her dark expression melting away to an expression of weariness that didn’t fit on a face as young as hers. She eyed the tall man and his pocket watch, and her anger returned, scrunching up her tiny features as her eyes became beady with hate. “I promise, one day, you won’t be.” 

Before I could say another word, Ava was led away by the red-lipped woman. The tall suit hustled me out the door, and he closed it behind me with the first smile I’d ever seen on that man. It looked like curdled milk. 

I rode the bus home, a heavy feeling weighing down my heart as I thought of Ava prying on the bars of her cage, and the bandages on her body. I got home in the middle of the night. My parents, predictably, were already in bed, not even caring I’d been gone for the day. 

Yvette, Fernando, and Jorge were lounging in the living room. Fernando sprawled across the couch while the twins each took a recliner beside him, as they played on our Playstation. As I trudged home, I saw a bowl of pasta sitting in my place at the table, with a fresh piece of sweetbread off to the side. 

“I, uh, made dinner,” Fernando said with a shrug. “I knew I could make pasta so I went with that.” 

“How’d it go with Ava?” Yvette blurted out, tossing her controller aside. 

She, along with Jorge and Fernando looked at me with anticipation, and I sighed, seeing the curiosity in their eyes. Every step I took into the house was laced with guilt, knowing just how Ava was paying for it. My room, my clothes, the food I ate, would all weigh heavily on my soul with the knowledge of what it took to get it. 

Even looking at my siblings, who finally were getting their own space and identities…I could hardly stomach it. I did, however, want to look out for them, even now. I suppose that was the burden of being the oldest, and no matter what, it’d never go away. I was foolish to think I’d ever be independent from that aspect of my life. Though seeing Ava, I think I got off easy in the burden I’d have to bear for the family. 

“Esperanza?” Jorge said, raising an eyebrow. “How is she?” 

I forced a smile onto my face. “She’s doing well.” 

My siblings all smiled at that, and I breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the guilt would be mine and mine alone. Hopefully, Ava’s promise will only fall on me as well, because I have a feeling, deep in my heart, that one day she will be free, and she’ll come for me. 

Deep down, I think I deserve it.

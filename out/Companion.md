I was in my office setting at the desk writing on my laptop. While I was thinking my elbow hit my pen and it fell to the floor. Accordingly, I bend down to pick it up when a searing pain strikes my lower back and down my left leg. Stopping immediately, I tried to sit up but my muscles locked. The solitary thing I could think of was my back must have gone went out as you hear happening to people. But that happens to elderly people. Slowly over five minutes I finally situated myself back in the sitting position. The only thing I could do was sit. I was even afraid to breathe. The phone rang, and I allowed it to ring. I wasn’t moving. I stayed in this position until my leg stopped tingling. I slowly tried to adjust myself in my chain but the pain started again ever so slightly. I sat frozen. I rolled my chair around my desk using my right leg, so I could reach my phone. I called my doctor and told her everything. She said it was most likely a muscle and not to worry. I could come this afternoon if I wanted. She instructed me to move slowly, so I wouldn’t aggravate the affected muscles more and to take some over-the-counter medicine for pain.

I told her I would be there shortly. As soon as I hung up, I took a few painkillers I had in my drawer. I set my alarm for 30 minutes and leaned back in my chair to hopefully calm the affected muscles and let the medicine work. I was close to falling asleep when the alarm went off. I slowly tried to stand using my arms and right leg as much as possible. Cautiously I was at long last in the standing but hunched over position. Standing straight sent that burning pain from my lower back down my left leg. Taking small steps, I conquered walking across the room. Then down the hall. I stopped in the living room for a few things I always carry when going out. I walked out the front door toward my car. I could imagine the neighbors watching me shuffle along like I was 100 years old. I didn’t care, causing more pain was more important. I practically fell in my seat and was off to see my doctor.

The medicine must be working because getting out of my car was less painful than I thought it would be. After leaning on the car, I began my short-stepped shuffle to her office. My doctor must have registered the pain in my voice because when I opened the door the nurse instantly conveyed me to an examination room. Instead of the exam table, I sat on the chair beside it. The nurse went through her routine of blood pressure, pulse, why I was there, and what medicines am I on. The usual stuff. When she was satisfied, she told me the doctor would be in momentarily. "Momentarily" could be a minute or an hour. I sat there in a haze of pain and medicine. After about 10 minutes she came through the door.

She inquired what I was doing when the pain started. Where the pain was. What movement hurt and what didn’t. Next, she made me stand and lean against the bed. She started to poke and prod around where the pain is. Then she raised and lowered both arms and legs. She said I would live and thought she knew what was wrong, but wanted to be sure. She told me to sit back down, and someone from MRI would take me and perform a scan. I sat in my little seat in the exam room for another half hour. Then a Tech came with a wheelchair to whisk me away to the MRI machine. After some delicate and slow movements, I was laying on the table while the massive machine moved over me. Before I could think about how small the space I was in, the exam was finished. The Tech put me back in the wheelchair and ferried me back to my exam room. I was beginning to enjoy the stiff chair when my doctor came back in. She asked me if I knew what the sciatic nerve was. Of course, I have heard of it but really didn't know what it was. She explained it was a cluster of nerves for the leg, foot, butt, and lower back. And it was extremely easy to irritate it. Anything from bending over to sitting. She gave me a prescription for muscle relaxers and told me to rest. When I regained my mobility, I should start lower back exercises. That was the only real cure for it. But until then, bed rest is the best. She said she would send the prescription to their pharmacy, and the nurse would bring it in with my paperwork. 

A different nurse came in with paperwork I had to sign, and while she was there, the other nurse came in with my medicine. She instructed me on their use. Only take one every 6 hours. These are strong. Don’t drink while on them. And don’t drive or operate heavy machinery. It may cause nightmares or in rare cases hallucinations. If this happens call us so we can prescribe something else. At this point, I was content it was something we could treat rather easily. I shuffled back to my car and drove home. I went straight to my comfy couch. I grabbed water from the fridge and took my first pill.


I began watching a movie on TV, but before the second commercial break, I was soundly asleep. I woke up and it was dark outside. I decided those pills were great. My back was sore, but the searing pain I felt when I moved was gone. I went to the kitchen and heated up the leftovers from last night. I grabbed a beer to drink with my dinner. I know the meds said not to, but one beer is nothing. Drinking is having four or five beers. I ate over the sink. My back felt better standing than sitting. Besides it only took me a few minutes to eat. I was hungrier than I thought. I went back to the couch and took another pill. I sat and watched the news while I finished my beer. I could feel the medicine working again since I was getting groggy. I went and filled up my thermal cup with ice water and then went back into the living room to stretch out on the couch. I hadn't even made it through the weather before I was asleep again.



I woke up at 5:25. I tried to move and the pain was severe. I slowly shifted and utilized my arm strength to get into a sitting position. The doctor explained I would be sore in the morning, so I should keep taking the pills until my body heals itself. Then we would start stretching and core training to prevent it from hurting again. As slow as I could go, I stood up and shuffled to the bathroom. I then went to the kitchen to get another cup of water and something to eat, so I could take my pill. After looking over the contents of my refrigerator, I decided a slice of cheese was the best choice. I unwrapped the slice and then bent it in half, and then again. I have eaten cheese like this since a child. It reminds me of the square cheese we periodically had with lunch at school. As I stood at the counter eating the last bite, a small chunk of the cheese broke away and fell to the floor. I would have just bent down and thrown it away. But the way my back was feeling, there was no way. It won’t hurt anything to leave it. When I feel better I will pitch it into the trash. But as I began walking back to the living room, a thought popped into my head. What if I forget about it, being groggy from the medicine and step on it and fall. That wouldn’t be very therapeutic for my sciatic nerve. As a result, I turned around and kicked the minute piece of food under the refrigerator. I would get it later.

As I was walking away, I hear an unusually quiet “Thnk yu!”.

“No problem,” I say, the words passing out of my mouth as if it was on autopilot. Then my brain registered what I heard, and I freeze.

I stood and tried to listen. The only noise was from the TV in the living room. I shrugged and went back to the couch. The medicine can cause hallucinations, and I did drink with them last night. I sat down and turned the channel. I took another pill and got comfortable. I have read how some hallucinations are very real. Well, that voice did seem real. Oh well if I have any other weird things happen, I will call my doctor. She might want to adjust or use a different medicine. I will think about it later. The pills were working their magic as my eyes became heavy.

My phone ringing roused me. It was 11:28. Sunshine was streaming through the window. It was Amy. She is my secretary. I told her I would be out till Monday. Naturally, she asked if I required anything, but I declined. I was sore, not crippled. She said I could call if I needed anything. I said thank you and got off the phone. I merely laid there. My back wasn’t feeling as sore, so I began my normal morning routine. I went to the bathroom and washed my face. It seems like if I stand but don’t put much weight on my left leg, the pain is manageable. I walked to the kitchen to make a sandwich. After fixing my lunch and refilling my tea glass, I started to think about what happened last night.

“Um, how you are holding up okay down there?” I ask. “Hello?”

There was silence. “Listen, I can’t really bend over right now, but if you’re down there. Are you hungry?”

Silence again. Yea it was the medicine. I picked up the facts sheet that they give with every prescription. It said that a small percentage experienced auditory or visual hallucinations. It said it was nothing to worry about, but if I was bothered I should contact my doctor for alternative treatment. It was almost noon, so my doctor would be out to lunch. I would call after 1 and inform her.

I began eating my sandwich and drinking my tea which was a little too warm. I turned to the refrigerator and set my glass under the ice dispenser. Click and clank came the ice down into my glass. All except one that bounced off the edge of my glass and hit my pants. The little piece of frozen water clunked onto the kitchen floor and skidded right under the refrigerator.

I thought to myself, ‘Great, I keep doing this, I am going to have a mess under there.’ As I turned to go back to the counter where my sandwich sits, I heard the little voice again.

“O good I thirsty,” responded the broken voice from under the refrigerator.

I stood against the counter. My eyes were glued to the bottom of the fridge. This was getting out of hand. I know I heard something that time. The genuine question is who or what was making it.

“You’re welcome,” I said slowly. “Who or what are you?”

“I companion.” came the small voice. “I liv with ou forever.”

“What do you mean you live with me? I’ve never seen or heard you before.”

“I help. I eat bad nighttime sleeps. I always help.” replied the voice.

“Bad nighttime sleeps? You mean nightmares?”

“Yes, nitemares. I eaten them long time.” proudly stated the voice.

“So you are saying you eat nightmares,” I started trying to achieve a fuller understanding of the situation. “When did you start helping me?

“I cam when you in littlest bed.”

“A baby. You are like the monster under the bed, but you are good and eat nightmares?” I challenged the voice. “So there is a monster under the bed.”

“Yes. I eat bad drems so don’t overwhelm and make you head sick.” the voice said.

I began thinking out loud. “You eat nightmares, so they don’t make me go insane. Are there others like you, or am I special?”

“Have many brothers and sisters that do the same thing. When a baby is born, we are too. We eat bad drems and leave good drems.”

“Incredible.” I stood leaning against the counter. “You said bed, so why are you under the refrigerator?

“I go under most things in house. I go room to room wherever ou go. But no leave house, unless ou move to new house.” The voice said.

“Kinda like a dog.” My mind raced to grasp what was going on. “I guess you go under the couch or chair when I sleep in the living room?

“Couch. I watch picture box with ou.”

“I should ask if you want to watch anything next time I watch TV.” I quipped. “I can assume you primarily rely on nightmares for food but can ingest ordinary food?”

“Yes.” came the reply from the voice. But regulr food is hard to get.”

“Well, you should have said something. I would share.” With this new and unusual development, I had forgotten about my back. But with my adrenaline back to normal, my back was on fire.

“Listen I need to eat, take my medicine, and take a nap.”

“Ou hurt?” inquired the voice.

“Um, my back. I just need to sleep. I’ll be okay.”

“Make better?” quizzed the voice.

“That’s the plan, friend. Hey, I don’t even know your name.”

“I no have name, no one to say it.” replied the voice.

“Well, we can’t have that. How about if I call you Bub?” I questioned.

“Like Bub. I Bub.” Bud said with happiness in his voice.

“Good, I’m pleased you like it. At the present moment, I need to get some rest. Are you going to get under the couch?

“Yes.”

I chewed the last bite of my sandwich and drank my tea. I carefully walked to the couch and sat down. “Hey Bub, you under there?”

“Yes.”

“Good. Do you want to watch anything in particular? I’m going to be asleep in a few minutes. So watch whatever you like.”

“I like the channel with all the places on it,” replied Bub.

“You mean the Travelers channel?”

“Yes, Travers channel.” Bub cheerfully said.

“There you go. I should be back up in a few hours.” I said as I adjusted myself on the couch. I stretched out and thought. I have either made an incredible new friend, or I have completely lost my mind. I always thought going crazy would feel different. 

I woke up and checked my watch. It read 8:25 PM. I adjusted myself and stared at the TV. I routinely require a few minutes to wake up, and the medication didn’t help. Then I remembered my hallucination or meeting earlier.

“Hello?”

“Hey, Bud?”

“You better? Came the voice from under the couch.

“A little, but I should be fine in a few days,” I replied as I tried to comprehend what was happening.

“That good. I like watching TeeVee. I like the different places.” replied Bub.

“Well, you can watch all you want. I need to go to the bathroom and eat.”

“OK. Friend.”

I cleaned up and prepared myself a sandwich. I took my pills and went back to the sofa with my food. I tore the crust off my sandwich and placed them under the couch. I thought if this was all the result of the medicine, then I am going to require an exterminator for all the mice and ants I will get for putting food under the furniture.

“Here you go, buddy. Part of my sandwich and a piece of ice out of my tea glass.”

“Thank ou.” came the voice

“Not a problem. I took my medicine, so we will sit here and watch some more TV.”

“Good sanwich. I ate while sleeping. It big an nasty. Tasty.” Replied Bub.

“I don’t remember a nightmare?”

“I eat.” stated Bub.

“Well don’t get indigestion with all the food. Until my back feels better, I will be sleeping a lot.” As I laid down on the couch. “I’m going to get comfortable. Do you want me to turn the channel or anything?”

“No this good,” answered Bub.

“OK. Night bub.”

“Nite.” came the voice.



I woke up bright-eyed and early the next morning. My back was feeling normal with no hint of pain. I decided to try to do my ordinary routine. Today is Sunday, so it isn’t really strenuous. As I sat on the couch letting myself wake fully, a voice came from under it.

“Good orning!”

“Good morning Bub. Did you sleep well?” I replied.

“I no sleep at night. I watch for bad sleeps, I eat them. I sleep through day.”

“OK. I will remember to keep the noise down during the day.”

“Ou still sick?” questioned Bub.

“I don’t think so, my back feels fine.”

“Good. I no like when ou sick.” beamed Bub.

“I don't like it either. I’m going to shower and make some breakfast,” I remarked as I got up from the couch. “Can I fix you something too?”

“No. I full.” came the voice from under the couch.

Besides trying to get back to my typical routine, I have decided not to take any of the medicine till tonight to help me sleep. I also want to know if the Bub is real, or just the medication. If he is still around by tonight, then I discovered a wondrous but strange creature. Initially, I didn’t know about him. But I would be lying if I said I didn’t like the companionship. It is nice to have someone to talk to.

I went to shower and then made breakfast. I sat and watched TV for a few hours, and then went into my home office to do some work. I had a ton of messages. Around 1 I prepared some lunch and went back to work. I eventually finished everything around 4:30. I went back into the living room to watch TV. My paperwork took longer than I expected, but I would be all up to date when I went back to work tomorrow. I started to feel hungry around 6, so I decided to order some Chinese for dinner. Like clockwork, 25 minutes later my doorbell rang with my usual Sunday dinner. I took the bag and carried it to the couch. Opening everything and arranging it on the table I asked.

“Do you like Chinese food Bub?”

“I not no. Never had befor.” responded Bub.

“You are in luck tonight my friend. I have a full menu of the best Chinese food around.”

We sat and ate dinner. I found out Bub loves rice noodles. I was feeling great. My belly was full, my back wasn’t hurting, and Bub is real. After such a delicious meal, we watched TV till around 10. Watching TV with Bub is like seeing TV for the first time. He has a dozen questions about everything. 

I was feeling sleepy since getting up early, so I decided not to take my medicine. I told Bub he could watch TV in the bedroom. The bed felt wonderful after the last few nights on the couch. Sleep came as soon as my head hit the pillow.

I woke up the next morning, I instantly said “Bub?”

“OOD morning.” came a voice from under the bed.

“Good morning,” I stated as I lay in the bed. “I might be late coming home this evening, catching up on work from the last few days. I’ll leave the TV on in the living room. Will you be ok?”

“I be fine.”

“Good. I have to get ready for work.” I stated as I walked to the bathroom.



It goes on like that for weeks. Bub especially likes cheese sandwiches on Kaiser rolls but he’ll eat about anything. His English is getting better the more we talk, though he still struggles with sibilants. I assume because of the way the mouth is formed. It’s delightful. I always have company, but I have privacy if I ask for it. Bub enjoys hearing about the world, and sometimes we listen to audiobooks or I read out loud. I made sure every room had someplace for him, so he can follow me if he likes.

Then it happened. I was half asleep, and someone came in through my bedroom window. To be honest, I don’t believe he thought anyone would be home. I had left my car at the garage and they had provided a service that dropped me off that evening and will come to pick me up tomorrow morning. Since my car was not in the driveway, and the house was dark; it looked like no one was home. When I sat up in bed, he flashed his light on me. We looked at each other in surprise, then he advanced to my bed. Lifting his hand, I recognize the outline of a knife. I had always imagined I would be more proactive with a burglar. But I wasn't. I was stunned. He was jerked to the ground like someone seizing his feet from under him. He screamed and my bed shook. Then both stopped. 

Bub broke the silence. “You OK? Badman go by.”

“Yea fine. Night Bub.”

I lay there looking at the ceiling thinking about what had happened. Apparently, the toe of the intruder's shoe must have gone under the bed. As I said, Bub will eat just about anything.

I was running late and it was my turn to tell a story. That made it worse. It was cold for October and would get even colder after the sun finished setting. Falling leaves kept whipping around my bike, occasionally hitting me in the face. I almost ate a few. Halfway to the spot, I stopped to turn on the flashlight taped to the handlebars. The light was slim and shaky, but good enough to navigate the dirt road that ran back to Meadow House.

Lex and JD were sitting on the crumbling wall around the mansion smoking when I pulled up.

“Hey, look who decided to show up,” JD said, tossing his cigarette into the gravel drive.

“Mom wouldn’t let me leave until I finished my English paper,” I said, walking my bike over to the others where they were leaning against a sturdier section of wall. “Where are Tone and Eddie O?”

Lex hopped off the wall and zipped her jacket up against the wind.

“Ed’s starting the fire and Tone’s working on the food. Did you bring it?”

I nodded and pulled a bottle of wine from my backpack.

“Just one?” JD asked.

“The cabinet was low. I guess my mom hadn’t restocked in a while. If I pulled more than one she’d probably notice.”

Lex examined the label. “Is it any good?”

“I have absolutely no idea.”

JD slid off the wall, smooth as water down a drain. He plucked the wine bottle from Lex’s hands, turning it from side to side. JD tapped the glass.

“Sounds good,” he said. “Sounds red. Besides, Eddie smuggled some beers out from his place.”

The three of us walked through the broken gate, each of us touching the left post with the four deep scratches. It was our little ritual, a reminder of when we first started our campfire stories. Meadow House must have been beautiful once. It was massive, taking up several acres a few miles outside of town. It had a dozen rooms, a garden, and even a fountain in the courtyard. What Meadow House lacked was a roof. I mean, it still had bits and pieces clinging to the frame like scraps of clothing on a river-washed corpse, but the place was essentially a wreck. Holes pitted the walls and all of the window glass had long since shattered from storms or stones. Kids used to come out to Meadow back in my parents’ time when they felt an urge to break or burn or just wanted some private space. My dad told me about it but the cops put a stop to that when the house started to attract drug dealers.

For a long time, Meadow House was left to rot. Then we found her. If there’s a better place on Earth to tell a ghost story, I’ve never seen it. I could smell the fire Eddie O was building before I saw it. It was a perfect October smell: smokey and strong, dry wood cracking. Eddie always liked using old wood from deep in the forest around Meadow House. He’d show up early before the rest of us to start gathering.

We usually set up in the garden just outside of the house; occasionally we banked the fire over the stones in the courtyard. That required us to walk through the mansion though, so it had to be a special occasion. While we loved using Meadow’s grounds to tell stories, the house itself was deeply…unpleasant.

There was an odor in the house, mildew and bad air and other dying things. You felt like you were being watched any time you were inside the walls. Not just watched but followed. Meadow House was a shell of what it used to be but something seemed to linger.

“Look who decided to show up,” Ed said when we walked over.

“Yeah, yeah, JD already said the same thing.”

Ed had set up the fire in the corner on some open ground ringed by faded patio stones. The flames were already licking two or three feet up from the pit. There were still a few ounces of sunshine left in the day but the edges were getting dark with purple smears on the horizon. I moved closer to the fire. I should have worn a thicker jacket but I’d just gotten a red windbreaker that looked a lot like the one James Dean wore in *Rebel Without a Cause*. I knew Tone loved old movies like that, so I figured she might like the jacket.

Tone was sitting on a big red cooler, heel tapping on a stone path, sipping Coke out of a glass bottle from a straw. She’d set up a small card table next to the cooler with hot dogs and chips, s’mores stuff, assorted snacks. There was a pile of sticks under the stable so we could spear the dogs and marshmallows and cook them over the fire.

“The buffet is open,” Tone said, hopping off the cooler. “First come, first serve.”

She reached into the cooler, pulled out another Coke, and sent it sailing my way.

“Don’t open it yet, Chris,” Tone warned. “It’s gonna be shook up.”

We all gathered around the fire as soon as the sun was finally and fully sunk. It was freezing everywhere outside of the ring of light but God it was nice huddled up to the flame. I cleared my throat. Everyone was watching me, waiting for my story.

“Have you heard the story of the Sledgehammer Slaughter?” I asked, launching into the tale.

*“They found the first body smashed to pieces on the riverbank. Every bone was broken, the skull a shattered dish with bits of purple-gray brains leaking out. According to the medical examiner, the cause of death was blunt force trauma from a sledgehammer. Detective Rorke was-*

“How could they know that the wounds were from a sledgehammer and not, like, a baseball bat?” JD interrupted.

“The shape of the blows, duh,” Tone answered. “Now shut up and let him finish.”

I smiled and continued. They hung on every word. I was really proud of this story; I spent all week working on it. Half an hour later, it was over. Everyone sat blinking like we’d woken up from a collective dream. Or nightmare. After cleaning up and packing up, we all went our separate ways. I almost–\*almost–\*worked up the courage to ask Tone if I could walk her home.

*Next week*, I promised myself.

She did compliment me on my jacket, at least. I went home and immediately fell asleep. When I woke up, there were police and ambulances all over my street. My neighbors were murdered in the night. I stood at the living room window looking out, shaking. I didn't know the details at the time but the way the cops darted around, their faces, and the sound of someone yelling out of view...it all put this lump of dread deep in my stomach. I knew something terrible had happened and maybe was *still* happening. The kind of awful that could reach out later and snatch me up if I wasn't careful. I didn't sleep the rest of the night and, on Monday at school, I found out what happened to my neighbors.

The entire family of four was beaten to death, smashed to pieces just like in my story.

We debated whether we should skip campfire stories the next Friday but that would mean breaking our tradition of telling a tale every week in October. That tradition had stood for nearly three years, so we ultimately decided to go ahead with it. The week after the murders was Eddie’s turn.

“Have you heard the story of the Ravenous Ticks?” he asked.

Eddie’s story was terrifying but, more than that, nauseating. Ticks the size of house cats that moved terribly fast. Victims walking around with the things hanging from them like swollen blood balloons. Lex actually threw up, scrambling off the log she was sitting on to go puke in the garden.

It was a good story, if gross. Once we were done, I took a deep breath, walked over to Tone, and asked her if I could walk her home. She thanked me but told me she had to bike home so she could be back by curfew. I walked to Meadow House that night, so I couldn’t keep up.

“No worries,” I said, smiling, praying for the ground to open up to swallow me whole.

“Sorry! Mom would kill me if I’m as late as last week. Would you like to meet me in Steven’s Park tomorrow morning, though? Just to hang out.” Tone asked.

“Yeah. See you then.”

I practically floated all of the way home.

My good mood ended when I met Tone at the park the next day.

“Did you hear about Father Gunsel over at First Methodist?” she asked as I joined her on a bench near the park gate.

“No, my family isn’t really the church type.”

Tone leaned in close enough for me to smell the strawberry shampoo she must have used that morning.

“They found the priest dead in his house last night,” she whispered, “drained of all of his blood.”

“Jesus.”

“Remind you of anything?” Tone asked. “Tick *tick* **tick**?”

I felt a chill despite the sunny skies. “Eddie’s story?”

“Weird, isn’t it? That poor family last week after your tale. Now a guy bled dry?”

“You don’t think I had anything to do with it, right?”

She flicked my shoulder. “Of course not. No way. But it’s too much to be a coincidence, Chris.”

I glanced around the park, the chill getting worse. The trees around us were covered in red and orange leaves, full-on autumn arrested. They reminded me of the campfire we gathered around each Friday.

“You don’t think Lex or JD or Eddie…” I began

Tone bit her perfect bottom lip and shook her head. “I don’t think so. I don’t know.” She hesitated. “Do you want to hear my theory?”

“I do.”

“*It’s the house*. There’s something wrong there. I always feel like something is watching us while we’re there. I think–okay, I know this sounds nuts–but I think there’s a presence in Meadow House feeding off our visits and has been for years. Slowly but now it’s getting stronger.”

I didn’t answer for a bit, turning over the idea in my mind. It was crazy but I’d also been feeling a rising unease with every visit to the house.

“I mean, we only go there four nights a year,” I said. “Even in three years, that’s only a couple of collective hours.”

“Maybe that’s enough.” Tone stuck out her tongue. “Look, it’s just my theory.”

I held up my hands. “It’s a good theory. I just…how do we test it without getting more people killed. I guess we could skip the campfire next week.”

“No. If I’m right and there’s something brewing at Meadow House, it might already be too late to stop it. We should keep an eye on it. I think our next campfire should be inside the house.”

“So we can observe any, uh, weirdness?” I asked, a little lick of terror climbing my throat.

Tone nodded. “From the house. Or from the group. The deaths being like the stories, Chris, there’s a connection. I’m sure of it.” She stood up. “Since we’re in a secret society now with a mission-”

“We are?”

“Absolutely. *Anyway*, now that we’re in the secret society, we need to have an initiation.”

“Yeah? What is it?”

Tone stood up and grabbed my hand. “You buy me [ice cream.”](https://www.travisbrownwriting.com/)

I wish I'd known then how our [trip was going to end](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wqoeo4/every_week_in_october_my_friends_and_i_used_to/). I would have run and never looked back.

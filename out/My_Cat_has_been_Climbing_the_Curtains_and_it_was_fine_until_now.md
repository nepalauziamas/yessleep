Yesterday I moved into a new house, it had been my dream to finally get through collage and get a respectable job, suddenly my cat, who’s name is La’Rayne jumped up on my lap and meowed impatiently, like she was looking for something. La’Rayne looked up at the window I was sitting by, so I decided I should see what she’s looking at. As I turned my head I saw blue poka-dot curtains that looked like they were stuck to the tan wall, I brushed it off and fell asleep, after all why would my cat be so concerned about curtains? 

I woke up to my cat climbing up the curtains and digging her dagger-like claws into the silky blue fabric. “Hey La’Rayne! Cut it out!” I yelled angrily at my cat. Then I thought how ugly they were, and how they were stuck to the walls. “Never mind I really don’t care.”I said to her, maybe she was doing me a favor. I walked into the kitchen and got out the cat food, it was time for La’Rayne to eat anyways. “La’Rayne,num nums!” I called to her.
La’Rayne was quite the foodie, and came meowing over to her bowl, and devoured her food like it was her last meal.

As I was sleeping, I jolted up and felt this wierd feeling like something was wrong, but I was never the adventurous type. I sat shivering in the cold night air, 
I don’t know why, but its cold down here in California. “Hello?” I called but then regretted it and hid under my covers.
Loud footsteps ran up the stairs, from where im geussing was the cellar, and to my bedroom door. I had a glass cat door for La’Rayne because it looked nice, why is that important you may ask? Well when I finally peeped through my covers, the fogged-up cat door had the the word “hello” written in wobbly handwriting. I felt like screaming, but I knew it would find me, so i went back to sleep.

By the next morning La’Rayne had clawed a hole in those hideous curtains, I gave her a pet on her 
forehead, then fed her as usual, but nothing could ever be usal after my late night encounter. Maybe I was dreaming, maybe my imagination was playing tricks, I dont know! I feel like people will say im making this up, so tonight im gonna sit on my favorite chair by the curtains to try and record it!

It was about a couple minutes before dark and I sat on my chair with my phone is my zip-up pants pocket.
I was trembling with fear when suddenly, I heard a shimmering sound, It was almost calming me down, then the curtains started glowing red, and the I realized they were making the shimmering. I was scared for my life, so I screamed, and suddenly a warm black tar looking hand bursted out of the now portal looking light in the curtains, and grabbed me by the neck, causing me to pass out.

I woke up dazed, and forgetful, “what happened…” I said in a soft wisper. I had not oppened my eyes at that point but when I did, I realized I was in a vast, damp cave with almost no light, As memories rushed back to me, I knew it was best not to talk. Saying this cave was huge would be an understatement, it had giant rocks that were keeping me in a play pen-like cage, the edge was just out of my reach, there was a small window my hand could fit through. I was terrified, and also woried where La’Rayne was. I mustered up the courage to say something but the best I could do was a weak “hello…?” As soon as I said it, a giant black fgure with about 24 eyes said “Mommy, Mommy! My new pet human can talk!” As soon as it finished talking, I slithered away from the window cutout, and fainted from superise.

As I woke up I got my phone and started typing all this, I have concluded my cat scratched open a worm hole, and I have been taken by some humanoid creature. I dont know how much time I have left and I can’t ask for help, I think I am here forever. But there might be a slim chance for me. I need your suggestions.

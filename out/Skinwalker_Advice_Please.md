Hi friends, 

I'm not typically a believer in legends or mythical creatures. But this one got me...

We're rockhounds in Northern Nevada. This puts us in some pretty remote areas of the desert... Today we went to a place we fondly refer to as "horse hill" because we saw a herd of wild horses on one of the hills we search. 

Today, May 15th, 2022, the day/night of the blood moon/eclipse. The weekend after Friday the 13th...

We were heading down the hill and getting ready to head out when we were approached by a [lone albino horse](https://imgur.com/a/U5ko0ZE) after sundown (note the blood moon behind) 

The horse went after my SO first. Getting so close he had to chase him off. My best friend and I noticed this and ran up the hill toward him. The horse would not leave... it was very interested in us. 

We noticed it had a limp. No branding. And the hooves had never been groomed.My friend wanted to help this horse. It seemed hurt and we felt empathy for the animal...

At first we were mesmerized by this beautiful horse in front of us. Where did it come from? What did it want? How long had it been here? "Why isn't it afraid of us?"

The horse was getting so close to use I could've pet him. But when it got close enough I backed up. I was afraid of this horse. now, I grew up around family that had horses, and i rode them as a child. I wasn't, and am not afraid of them.. but I didn't trust this horse. Something told me NO. I felt fear and anxiety when it got closer. Not because it was a wild animal (I love nature).. but because something about it felt wildly off.. 

After a while of this horse moving toward us, and us backing away, it turned and started heading west. Walked off into the darkness. My friend noted the limp was gone. Afterward, we got in the truck and went home. Not giving it more thought. 

I'm terrified what would have happened had I touched this horse. Or we had helped it like my friend was thinking of doing... (I had talked her out of it because we have NO MEANS to help a wild horse in the middle of the desert.) 

I believe it was feigning a limp to play on our sympathies and gain access. 

My little sister saw the photo of the horse and reminded me of Skinwalkers. My blood ran cold and goosebumps covered my body. I am terrified. 

I want as much information on Western USA legend Skinwalkers that can be found. What do I do next? What could've happened? Any, and ALL accurate information is appreciated. 

I do know a basic amount of information, growing up near the Pauite/Shoshone tribe in Northern NV. But anything, truly anything... helps. 

Do I need to protect myself?

I'm now here at my home, safe. I think... 

Thank you.

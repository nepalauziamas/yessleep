Floating, slowly up and up, the black becomes shade of grey ever lightening to the sunrays peeping through my blinds. Groaning I roll over to check the time. 8:03, shit. I’ve slept over twelve hours and somehow I’m exhausted. Feeling suddenly nauseated, I sprint to the bathroom while rubbing the sleep from my eyes. I dry heave into the bowl with no such luck, thick saliva strands dangle patiently waiting. Once I’m satisfied nothing is coming out, I wipe my lips. Reflective crimson smears across the back of my hand, immediately startling the hairs on my neck. I freeze.

Mirror. Look in the mirror. Trembling, I turn. Mousey brown hair, messily parted in its usual place; okay good. Eyes - golden hazel but severely bloodshot. How long have I had contacts in? . . . I couldn’t remember. Nose – still there, dotted with soft freckles. Mouth? Is this what humans have for a mouth? Reflecting back at me was a reddened maw. A swollen, wretched excuse for lips that have been torn to shreds. The bottom lip seeming massive in comparison to the top. Dark bloody scabs cover the inside; was I gnawing on them as I slept? I’m surprised only that little bit off blood smeared on my hand when I wiped them, they all seem dangerously close to surface oozing. Upon further inspection of the wounds, some should need stitches, some seem partly healed, and others are freshly ripped off top layers of epidermis. How long could this have gone on for? The bathroom walls start to cave in as my head spins full of questions.

Cold rises up to warmth, the edge of my soul searing. My stomach wakes me, threatening twinges of painful cramps. I must eat something. Scrambling out of the covers, tumbling down the stairs, swishing into the kitchen where I rip open the fridge in one full swoop. Containers? Chinese food containers, regular Styrofoam takeout boxes, plastic cups with lids. As I’m scanning the contents I realize what’s missing – junk. The little bottles of sauces you collect overtime, seasonings and dressing you save, condiments, and then, not even junk. Literal food is not seen, no bags of vegetables or lunch meat, no milk or soda cans, no snacks or jars, just containers. Filling every square inch of the fridge and lining the rows on the door, no visible food, just a wall of white staring back at me. No color, no smell, no difference, no telling what could be inside.

Rumbles tear pain into the soft part of my belly, and without caring I grab a box. Placing it on the counter, I lift the lid, and freeze. Trapped inside my body I have no control. Looking down into the everyday takeout container my fingertips drift down the sides, sliding through something wet. As I compulsively bring my hand up to my face I lick the blood from my fingers. I feel my body smile but inside I cant breathe, why can’t I move? No, stop, stop please don’t! Like a coyote ripping into a dead carcass, my face lunges into the odorous box and proceeds to eat the goat entrails.

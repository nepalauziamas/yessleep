So my friend Anna (fake name) 23f ordered a package worth $300 (clothes, accessories, etc) about two weeks ago but when she ordered she
put all of her information and address correctly except for her apartment number. Now two days ago she got notice that her package got delivered, the apartments we live in get some
packages delivered in the office while some others get delivered at the front door of your apartment in this case it was the apartments office. Well since she knew she got the apartment number wrong she went up to the apartment number she put on the delivery information to ask if they received the package and if they did, to please give it back. Well the apartment is literally in front of hers and as soon as she got there a white lady angrily opened the door and before my friend could fully explain why she was there the lady started yelling "I don't know who Anna is get the hell out of here" and started pushing her with her chest. My friend doesn't speak English very well and so it's hard to understand sometimes but she went up there in a calm manner. When the lady started doing this she got really mad and push her that when they started fighting, my friend ended up with deep scratches causing blood to come down her face the lady didn't receive much damage except some hair pulling and being dropped on the floor. Now the lady had the audacity to call the police even though she still had my friends package and when they got there the only thing they did was tell my friend that since the package had the lady's apartment number on it, the package was hers and that she needed to stay inside for 48h so things could calm down. Now am no expert of the law but I think they could have check the full address, my friends ID, the online order items and receipt, etc. But no they said the package belonged to the lady because of the apartment number. The police officers didn't give my friend a report, they didn't let her have someone that also spoke her language (Spanish) talk to her and let her explain, they didn't even gave her their names. I think this was unfair and am trying to convince my friend to do something the lady didn't press charges because she knew she had a package that didn't belong to her. The apartments also told my friend that this was unacceptable and that if something like this ever happened again they could evict her, they lady didn't get the same notice. Am scared something can happen again because my friend is not someone that lets things go easily and the lady that stole the package lives right in front of her so they are going to see each other again. My friend said she was going to try to get a refund but I told her it wouldn't work and even thought what she did was wrong there should be something else she can do. Also this happened in Tennessee. Also there is video of this. Are there any lawyers or people with knowledge that can help? It would be appreciated.

I run a private campground.  It’s a bit early - okay, a lot early - but you should consider making a reservation for the public camping weekends in the spring.  In fact, make a reservation and pay early.  I *really* need a new four-wheeler.  And I’m sure the [supernatural war](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/lirugv/how_to_survive_camping_a_funeral_for_the_inhuman/) happening on my land will be wrapped up by then.

...yeah.

If you’re new here, you should really [start at the beginning](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/clp5h4/how_to_survive_camping/) and if you’re totally lost, [this may help](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/comments/fz6a1d/how_to_survive_camping_index/).

It’s been an eventful week, and that’s saying something around here.  No one is dead, at least, though it came close.

I was woken in the night by a phone call to the camp’s emergency line.  Considering we don’t have campers right now, this was surprising.  Bleary and rather confused, I answered.

It was Bryan’s mother.

He hadn’t come home, she said.  She’d been waiting for him but it was almost midnight now and he wasn’t answering his phone either.  Could I check, she asked, and see if he was on the campground?

“I didn’t see his car when I locked the gate this evening,” I said.

“Just check for me.”

Her demand was polite, but urgent.  I sighed and said I would.  I’d call her back, I promised, as soon as I got done checking the parking lot.  Then I got out of bed and hastily dressed, grabbing my heaviest jacket.  I could at least take the car to check the staff parking lot, but I was not pleased to be going out in this cold in any form.

Bryan is one of the few staff members that has a key to the gate.  It was certainly possible for him to come by the campground at odd hours - and he’s done it before - but I was desperately hoping that his mother was wrong.  The only reasons I could think of for him to return after dark were deeply foolish ones.  Like giving his dogs clandestine bellyrubs.

I mean, they *are* very good doggos, but they also have a job to do right now.  I suspect their presence is what’s keeping the fomorian away from a fairy that isn’t ready to fight it yet.

Bryan’s car was parked behind the barn.  Tucked in the last spot by the dumpster, where it wouldn’t be easily visible from the road.  I cursed under my breath and put my car in park and focused.  I needed Beau.  He was my only contact to the inhuman world and I wanted their help to locate him.  Even if I assembled a search party of my staff, it was a big campground and it’s rather hard to find people on it.

Also, I don’t want to be the one searching on foot.

Beau didn’t take long to arrive.  I rolled the window down and he came and leaned over me, resting one arm on the frame of the car.

“I need your help,” I said.  “I need you to find someone since I don’t have a four-wheeler anymore.”

“You’re taking advantage of our arrangement,” he replied coldly.

Seriously?  Since when has he been keeping track of who is more in debt to the other person?

“Aren’t you doing the same?” I snapped.  “You’re getting a name because of me.”

He tilted his head slightly, considering.  He didn’t appear to like what I said, because he pressed his lips together, but he didn’t rebuke me, either.  I took that as a sign I should continue.

“Bryan is on the campground when he shouldn’t be,” I said.  “I think he’s done something dumb.”

“Do you care?”

I was more than a little offended.

“Of course I care!  He’s a good employee and -”

I hesitated.  Could I call him my friend?  We didn’t talk much.  I don’t think we’re friends, exactly.  Even if he and his dogs have saved my life on more than one occasion.  More like… I feel better with him around.  More stable.  Secure.

“He’s important, okay?” I said.  “I need to know he’s safe.”

“Very well then.  I’ll ask the dancers to search for him.  Go home and wait for us.  We’ll come to you when we find him.”

Perplexed, I watched him go.  I’d expected him to argue, but that was it.  He just accepted my explanation and went off to find him.  I think… Beau wasn’t asking me if I cared as an accusation.  I think he wanted to be certain Bryan was someone I thought worth saving.  If he was worth the risk.

And then he took me at my word.

Very rarely, I feel that inhuman things are easier to deal with than people.

I did as he asked.  No sense making things difficult for them by going and searching the woods myself.  Besides, I didn’t think I’d be able to help much, especially not on foot.  Search and rescue in the dead of night is often a lost cause without a *lot* of people helping.  The deep woods are especially difficult.  The same presence that cuts away the outside world and cloaks the forest in quiet serenity turns it into a treacherous morass of shadow after nightfall.

Humans are strangers to the forest.  We don’t belong.

I went home and settled in on my sofa.  I figured I could at least get some sleep while waiting, albeit close enough to hear anyone at the door.  I didn’t even take my shoes off.  Just threw myself onto the sofa and pulled a blanket over top of me and fell into a light sleep.

So of course the dancer knocked hard enough on my door to wake the dead.  I swear she did it deliberately.

I came out of a restless dream swinging.  I wasn’t sure what I was attacking, exactly, but I threw the blanket back and had a fist in the air for what I’m sure was a very weak blow.  Then, heart hammering, I realized that the noise was coming from the entryway.

I can’t complain too much.  They were helping me out, after all.

“I’m coming!” I called.  “Calm down!”

I checked to see who it was before opening the door.  The lead dancer quickly slipped inside.  She was dressed sensibly… from the waist up, at least.  She wore a heavy plaid coat, scarf, and hat.  From the waist down she looked ready for the beach in garish bermuda shorts and flip flops.

“I thought you could barge in whenever you wanted,” I said.

“Not quite.  Conditions have to be met.”  She dusted snow off her shoulders.  “Anyway, we found your employee.”

The news was about as bad as it could be.  He’d gone into the deep woods and the fomorian took him.  The creature had a lair, she said, and that was where it’d dragged Bryan.  The other inhabitants of the campground avoid it.  It is a dead place of dry wood and rotting grass.  She, however, had requested that one of the musicians stand watch over it and mark the fomorian’s coming and goings.

I was a little irate at only just now finding out that the fomorian has a *lair*.  I have a “no fire” rule but I’m willing to make exceptions now and then.  This feels like a reasonable exception, especially if it’s filled with highly combustible dry wood.

Then the dancer said the lair couldn’t be accessed by human means.  Mattias had said that there were many places that sat alongside our own world.  Places where inhuman things dwelt.  My heart sank.  This was where Bryan was being held.

“Can you get me inside?” I asked.

“I can.  But you’ll be on your own after that.  Is this person worth risking your life for?”

“He is.”  Then I added something I felt she would understand.  “He risked his life to save mine before.  I owe him.”

“Hmm.  I suppose so.”

She stared at me a moment, her expression inscrutable.  I felt like I was being measured, but I didn’t know the scale to which I was being compared.  Finally, she gave me a terse nod and told me to follow her.  She led me through the yard - and the little girl stood silently by - and out to the field beyond.  Beau was waiting for us.  The two conversed softly and Beau nodded, then turned and walked curtly away.

“He’s going to ensure the fomorian is distracted for a time,” the dancer said.

She held out her hand.  I took it.

“This won’t be long,” she said.  “But keep up.”

She began to walk briskly and I went with her.  We entered the woods and at first, it seemed like nothing had changed.  The dancer moved far faster than I would prefer, given we were in the woods, and I struggled to match her pace.  I think my ankles found every fallen branch between us and our destination.  But fairly soon I realized I wasn’t tripping on anything else and that the land had leveled out and there was nothing beneath my feet except dry leaves.  The sound of them crackling at my footsteps echoed through the woods.  The trees were perfectly straight, their branches bent sharply towards the starless sky.

The dancer’s skin was luminescent.  It shone like an opal, the red and blue lines of her veins forming a webwork of color underneath her translucent flesh.

Mattias said he found these places by following the inhuman things.  By staying close to them.  Slipping in behind them before the door was closed.  For a moment, I had an odd feeling, like I was following a path I already knew.  Like my very bones remembered.

“Are we… in the gray world?” I whispered.

“We’re adjacent.  Not far now.”

We weren’t alone.  I realized this with an uneasy sense of trepidation.  There was something following us.  I saw light in the corner of my eyes, like candles, all clustered together.

The gummy bears saw my death in the trees, sometimes.

“Don’t look back,” the dancer warned.

When an inhuman thing tells you to not look back, *you don’t look back*, no matter how tempting it may be.  I clenched my hands into fists, digging my nails into my palms, and focused on that slight pain instead.  Anything to distract me from the near overwhelming urge to turn and look, to see that which followed behind us.  It felt like it was breathing down my neck.  I had a wild thought that perhaps it was, just waiting for some slight indication that my resolve was going to falter, and then it would pounce.  I kept my gaze firmly on the path ahead of us.

“This is as far as I go,” the dancer said, stopping abruptly.  I almost ran into her back.  “Go straight from here, at a run.  You’ll be inside the lair within five paces.”

“And how do I get back out?”

“Oh I don’t know,” the dancer replied.  “You’re human.  This world doesn’t want you here.  So just... go be you at the problem, I guess.  It’ll be fine.  Now run!”

And she shoved me in the middle of my back, propelling me forwards.  I no longer held her hand.  The forest around me suddenly felt alive and keenly aware of my presence.  I saw the lights again, in the corner of my eye.  They weren’t the dancing, erratic pattern of the lights that I tell people over and over not to follow.  They stayed at the same height, moving in unison with a fluid consistency.

They were growing larger.  Coming closer.

I ran.

Five paces.  I took one long stride.

My death lived among these trees.

Two.

It glowed like a flame, like the throat of the beast.

Three.

Did Mattias know what lurked in this in-between space?

Four.

Did my mother?

Five - I felt something brush my back like a breath of air -

I went face-first into thorns.  The presence was gone.  The air smelled of rain and hay, like I was inside a damp barn.  I shoved at the thorns, trying to get my feet under me and detangle myself from the spines.  I could see thick trees all around me, their trunks growing together to form a barricade of dry rot.  At the edge of the clearing was a massive thorn thicket, in which I’d tumbled.  My back was to the tree wall; the thicket between me and the rest of the clearing.

And good thing it was, I realized, my heart hammering.  For on the opposite side rested the dapple-gray stallion on a bed of brown moss.  Its breathing was deep and even.  I held perfectly still for a moment, trying to reassure myself that it wasn’t waking up.

“Kate!”

Bryan’s whispered hiss came from the middle of the thicket, thin and frightened.  Desperately, I clawed at the thorns and then thrust my hand out.  The thorns stabbed at my arm through the fabric of my jacket and I strained, pressing my entire body deeper into the branches, until I felt another hand clasp mine.  Bryan.  His grip was painfully tight, holding on as if thrown a lifeline.

“I got you,” I hissed.  “It’s okay.”

“You need to get out of here,” he whispered urgently.  “The fomorian won’t kill me.  I’ll be okay.”

“Well it won’t kill me either and I’m not abandoning you, even if you are an idiot.”

“You do some pretty dumb things yourself.”

“Like rescue my dumbass employee with a murder horse sleeping a few yards away?”

With my free hand, I drew my knife.  The harvester’s knife, able to cut through anything unnatural.  I’d used it quite a bit when clearing thorns, trying to clear the branches enough to get at the trunk.  I moved slowly, for while the knife cut cleanly I didn’t want any to fall and make too much noise.  I lowered each to the ground, carefully, trying to avoid pulling at any of them and shaking the entire thicket.  Bryan was trapped in the middle, and although he was trying to keep it out of his voice, I still heard the strain of the pain he was in.  The less the thorns moved, the better.

Finally, I could see him.  His face was cut and bleeding.  His hands were even worse.  He’d struggled, but the spines held him fast, and every movement likely only drove them deeper into his flesh.  Carefully, I pried them away, cutting as I went.  I freed his arm and he helped as best as he could, bending the branches away from him so I could cut them off and set them aside.  We worked quietly, talking only in whispers, each listening intently for a sign that the horse was waking up.

Finally, he was free.  I held onto his arm and helped him step out of the heart of the thicket.  His movements were stiff, his joints aching from being trapped for however many hours he’d been held in this cage.

“How do we get out of here?” Bryan asked, tentatively glancing around the clearing.

I shrugged helplessly.  The dancer hadn’t exactly given me clear instructions.  Just that this world doesn’t want us here… but it didn’t seem to be taking any steps to expel us.

Or perhaps we hadn’t given it a good enough reason yet.

Just go be you at the problem, she’d said.  Well… in my family, we solve our problems with murder.

“I’m gonna stab the murder-horse,” I said in a low voice.

“Kate, no,” Bryan whispered desperately.

“Oh I’m doing it.  Get ready to run like hell.”

Cautiously, I crept towards the sleeping horse.  Behind me, Bryan whispered something under his breath that I’m going to assume was a prayer.  I moved across the clearing as quietly as I could until I stood directly by the stallion.  Its head was slack, its legs folded beneath it.  Its breath was like listening to a gale.

I struggle to kill things when I’m not angry.  We’ve seen this from me before.  But I brought to mind what this horse had done, how it had taken my niece.  The cries of my sister-in-law when she discovered her baby was missing.  And inside me flared that old anger, that hatred of these things that we are so powerless against.  I nurtured it inside of me like a spark, feeding it my memories until it blossomed into an inferno, and the heat of it thawed my heart and my muscles.

I brought the knife down in a sweeping arc, putting the full weight of my body behind it, and stabbed it right in the neck.

Okay, it’s a *big* horse.  Apparently animals that big can shrug off knife wounds.  It does, however, make them very very angry.

The horse jerked its head up and screamed in pain and rage.  The eye closest to me swiveled to stare at me and it was like a fire burned behind its glassy pupil.  I ripped the knife free as the stallion surged to its feet, pulling its hooves beneath it and drawing itself up to its full height.  It towered over me.

“Kate!” Bryan screamed.  “The trees!”

They trashed around us like they were in a storm.  The dapple-gray stallion staggered, blood running down its neck, its breathing harsh.  I turned and ran to where Bryan stood waiting, poised to flee, at a gap that had appeared between the groaning, twisting tree trunks.  The lair had woken up to our presence and we were *not wanted* any longer.

Bryan ducked through and I was quick to follow.  We ran down a short passageway, the floor uneven beneath us like we were stepping on exposed roots.  A light appeared at the end, growing rapidly larger with every step, as if it were rushing forwards to consume us.  Then I stumbled out into darkness again and the only light was from the distant moon.  The shadows of the barren branches above us formed a webwork on the pristine snow we stumbled through.

Behind us exploded the stallion.  Splinters of wood and shattered bark flew past my head.

“Did you have an escape plan past this point?” Bryan gasped.

“Nope.”

I gripped the knife tighter.  But Bryan didn’t seem concerned.  He slowed and turned.

“I’ll take over from here, then,” he said quietly.

And summoned by that unseen bond between master and hound, the dogs appeared.  They flowed out of the shadows of the trees as if cut from the cloth of the night itself.  Their eyes blazed like meteors.  They threw themselves into a row between the horse and ourselves.  Their growls rumbled low in their chests like an array of engines and their teeth shone ivory.  The horse drew up short, its hooves throwing up snow and sparks as it skidded to a stop.  It snorted and threw its head, splattering blood across the ground in a long arc.  It stamped at the ground, stepped to the side, and the dogs were quick to adjust.

They would not let it pass.

Another noise rang out from the forest.  Metal upon metal, followed shortly by the snapping and crash of a falling tree.  Not too far from where we stood, though well out of eyeshot.  I listened, heart racing, and there was another clash of metal, like the ringing of a bell.

“The fairy!” Bryan gasped.

He’d summoned the hounds away.  And the fomorian had taken the opportunity.

Weeks of a stalemate, ended in only a handful of seconds.  An unnatural instinct whispering that *now* was the time, that *now* his foe was unprotected.  I seized Bryan’s hand, pulling him along with me.  He hesitated, his gaze stuck fast to the horizon and the distant sound of weapons clashing.  It reminded me of the snapping branches under the weight of winter ice.

“There’s nothing we can do,” I said breathlessly.  “Let’s get out of here so the dogs can go help.”

It was all we *could* do.  Get ourselves to safety so the dogs were free to go assist their other master.  Bryan and I ran.  His breathing was labored, his body depleted from his ordeal in the grip of the thorns, but still he ran.  He pushed his body to the limits, staggering through the snow behind me.  And the two of us fled the deep woods, up the hill, and the dogs slunk away when we reached the field.

My side was knotted with pain and my throat was raw by the time we staggered up to the fence of my house.  The little girl watched with silent tears that glittered like frost on her cheeks as I opened the garage and led Bryan inside.  He collapsed on the sofa.  I slipped into the kitchen to call his mom.

She was relieved.  I kept the details scarce.  Yes, he was here.  He’d come to see the dogs.  Yes, he was fine.  Yes, I promised to call as soon as I checked the parking lot and I didn’t, yes, I’m very sorry.  Seriously, I’m sorry ma'am.  So sorry.  No, he wouldn’t be driving home tonight, it was late and rather cold, he’d just sleep on the sofa and come home in the morning.  It’d be fine.  He wasn’t a bother.

It took some convincing that I wouldn't be inconvenienced by his presence.  I didn’t try particularly hard to get her off the line, either.  If I listened carefully, I could hear Bryan crying softly in the other room.

When I finally finished the conversation, he was asleep.  I lay a blanket over him and went to my own bed for what remained of the night.

In the morning, I fed him breakfast, and then I yelled at him.  Demanded to know what had possessed him to go down into the deep woods.  The dogs were in the care of the fairy.  The most powerful creature on this campground.  There was nothing he could do for them other than to trust that they were safe and to not endanger himself.  I didn’t make rules for no reason, I said, and hadn’t I told him to stay out of the deep woods?

He accepted the lecture for only a few minutes, but his stoic resolve quickly faltered and a glint of defiance appeared in his eyes.  Finally, his head snapped up and he stared at me, jaw clenched in resolve.

“I love them!” he said, the words coming out only with an intense concentration of will, heavy with emotion.  “Do you know how hard it is to be separated from someone you love?”

We… weren’t talking about the dogs anymore.

After Bryan left the campground, I went looking for the spot of the battle.  I hoped that Beau would come find me, so that I knew he was okay, but nothing stirred in the forest.  Like everything was hunkering down and staying out of sight after what transpired overnight.  When I finally found the spot - marked by a slew of downed trees - a heavy snow had begun to fall.  Another hour and it would have obscured the bloodstains.

Brilliant red blood, the color of roses, frozen in the ice.  And sluggish black-red blood, like those same roses long after their autumn decay.  The fairy and the fomorian.

There was a lot more of the fairy’s blood in the snow.

I’m a campground manager.  My rules exist because I think if I can just control people, tell them what they need to do, everything will be fine.  It’s a vain hope.  People aren’t rational creatures that will look at what needs to be done and simply do it.  There is a myriad of other motivations and desires inside of us, a roiling mixture of wants and needs and impulses.  We’re not *really* in control of ourselves.  And I certainly can’t hope to control anyone else.

I’m very angry at Bryan.  I’m not sure I won’t stay angry for a while.  I don’t understand it.  I’ve never been in love with someone.  I’ve never even really *desired* anyone.  It all seems a little irrational to me.  Like I’m the only sensible person in a world of fools.

Maybe all of you will understand him.  Maybe you’ll have the sympathy I lack.  Because right now… I can only think of how the fairy may be out there, wounded, and what that means for the fate of my campground. [\[x\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/goatvalleycampgrounds/)

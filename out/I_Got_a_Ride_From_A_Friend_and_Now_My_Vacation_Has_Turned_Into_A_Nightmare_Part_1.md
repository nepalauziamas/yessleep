The visit started as well as it could have. I woke up while the train was still moving, with the warm spring sun beaming onto my face, and a cool bead of sweat running down my forehead. As we came to a stop, and the other passengers began to stir, I found myself almost glued to my seat. It wasn’t idle laziness, an affliction of comfort, that kept me there, but rather an altogether familiar problem.

&#x200B;

“I’ve got no idea where I’m going to start.” I thought to myself, still sitting on the worn blue fabric that had been my home for the past eight hours. There were so many people to visit, whom I hadn’t seen for so long, and so many sites I longed to revisit. You would think that with a ride as long as I’d had I would have had no trouble planning my visit. Starting with which hotel I’d stay in at night, and working my way through a long list of friends, I could have made liberal use of my time onboard to tick off all the boxes that make a vacation plan perfect. I chose to fall asleep instead and was now bearing the consequence of that, as I watched one person after the other exit, while I remained glued to my seat in paralysis. I was lost in my thoughts, with no hope of sorting them and no means of starting.

&#x200B;

That was when I saw him, though I now wish I hadn’t.

&#x200B;

Standing on the train platform outside my window, waving his arms like a madman, while his golden blonde curls flickered in the sunlight, was Gilbert Reproulx. One of my oldest friends, and a lifelong companion. He stood now as a literal shining beacon of hope for this underprepared and disoriented visitor. Seeing his familiar face I grabbed my single piece of carry-on luggage and made my way to the exit. Once I was out and onto the platform my stride quickly turned into a modest jog and to no surprise of mine our words made contact before either of us did.

&#x200B;

“Bout time you got here. Looking good as ever by the way.” He flashed a grin

&#x200B;

“Thanks! you too. Man am I glad to see you Gil. I honestly had no idea of how I’d handle this visit until you turned up.”

&#x200B;

“Well if that Isn’t the guy I’ve always known. Going from one thing to the next and leaving it to me to keep things sorted.” The grin he had started to flash before had transformed into a smug smile.

&#x200B;

“Looks like you’ve got me all figured out, and I’m gonna assume that means you have some idea of how I’ll be spending my visit?”

&#x200B;

“Just about. I’ve at least planned out enough visits, with old pals, to keep us busy for the first day. It won’t be much, but we can plan out the flashier bits when we crash at my place for the night.”

&#x200B;

“That sounds a lot better than the whole lot of nothing that I had planned out before. Just say the word and me and my carry on are ready for whatever you have in store.”

&#x200B;

“Awesome. Car’s that way.”

&#x200B;

As he pointed from where we were on the platform we began to make our way through the parking lot to a well worn, but comfortable, BMW, and got in. The first few minutes of the drive were carried out in silence. Mind you this wasn’t the type of silence born out of trepidation, but simply comfort. Gil and I had known each other from the time when my list of friends extended only to him and my parents. Neither of us really felt that much of a need to bother with the small talk that other companions might have, as we had known for a long time now, we were the type of friends that could pick up with each other after ages apart, and act as if we’d only seen each other the day before. We took in sight after sight. Until our silence was finally broken as we turned the final bend on our way to the first stop in our evening.

&#x200B;

“This is the road to Seth's house.” I declared. Ultimately being the one to break the comfort of silence.

&#x200B;

“Glad to see you remember. I almost would’ve thought you’d forgotten about that slouch, what with how he never gets out, never does anything worth knowing.” Gil grimaced as he said this.

&#x200B;

“On the couch, on the town, what difference does it make to me Gil? Being away all these years I wouldn’t have seen him either way.”

&#x200B;

“Fair enough pal. We’ll just have to make up for lost time now won’t we?”

&#x200B;

I readied an answer, but it grew stiff in my throat as we arrived at our destination.

&#x200B;

There was a resemblance to the house I remembered from childhood. I’ll at least give it that, but back before I’d left home Seth’s parents had always been adamant about making their home the \`jewel of the crescent\` (their words not mine).” Now the place looked as if its occupants had left no later than I and nobody came to take over. Once white siding on the house had now become stained with the greenish gray palette of moss and mold, cobblestone walkways were barely visible through unchecked overgrowth and the garden we three played in, along with Seth’s pet dog, was now nothing more than a pile of weeds. I turned to Gil. A look of unease quickly grew on my face as I spoke.

&#x200B;

“Jesus Christ Gil! Don’t tell me they’re still living here?”

&#x200B;

“Just Seth. His parents are out of town and he’s just keeping a handle on the place for them.”

&#x200B;

“This is keeping a handle on it? I’d hate to see the place when he’s slacking.”

&#x200B;

“Has he ever done anything else bud?”

&#x200B;

We began making our way towards the front door of the house, parting an ocean of greenery along the way, before reaching the edge of the porch. That was when I noticed it and I stiffened. From where we stood, just at the precipice of the faded wooden porch, I could now see that the entrance to the house was resting slightly ajar. Putting aside the fact that Seth was allowing god knows how many field mice to invade his home, he was putting his dog, Boxer, in a position to escape. The radiant golden retriever had been known to wander off, and on more than one of these occasions he had returned, with fur caked in garbage, carrying diapers or worse fixed in his teeth. Pushing my worried thoughts aside, I brought myself back into the moment. It was then that I noticed Gil was already at the threshold. Brushing aside the already open door and exposing the two of us to the noxious odors spilling out from within.

&#x200B;

There had been a flood in my hometown way back. It left every building left in its wake wracked with mildew and bloated drywall and the first smells to take my notice brought me back to those weeks where we’d all had to tear out our basements and start over, or accept the water damage as our own. I wasn’t sure why the house had taken on that smell, it was common knowledge that Seth’s Mom and Dad had been obsessed with fixing their basement, and as far as I knew there hadn’t been any floods in town since the one I was here for, so how could that much water have entered the house?. The only things I could think of as sources were windows left open in thunder showers, leaky pipes left too long, and the occasional spill slipping through splits in the linoleum could all contribute to some extent. To this extent though, they would have had to be allowed to happen at every occasion, left dripping for months on end, and been allowed to sit and never be cleaned up. Yet, all of that paled in comparison to the stench the mildew carried in its wings. It hit us like a wall and though my words will ultimately fail to describe the overwhelming disgust it conjured. I could try to paint a crude description by saying it was like what would happen if you exposed the contents of a dumpster to three days of full sunlight, garnished the mound with rancid cat litter and added a spritz of sickly sweet perfume as a finishing touch. All of this was enough to make me lurch, but Gil barreled through and not wanting to be left alone, I followed.

&#x200B;

The inside of the house matched the odors it fostered in its measure of decrepitude. Mud caked the cracked floor of the entryway with prints of countless rodents,  and one mutt, baked in. Paint peeled and walls were cracked under the weight of enduring weather that they were never meant to from outside. The smells were even stronger here and the whole house was empty of any signs of life, save for a distant flickering coming from the far end of a hall, and the faint whispers of voices that likely came from the same source.

&#x200B;

“He’s just down there.” Gil said, while he moved towards the flickering lights, and bore a stern look on his face as the sensations drew us in.

&#x200B;

“How does he live like this Gil, why haven’t you had an intervention?” My voice was littered with anxious confusion as I spoke. Gil had always been such a good friend to me and the fact that he had allowed Seth to do this to himself, while he lived just a few blocks over, left me feeling so disoriented.

&#x200B;

“Seth and I were never close like you and I.” He responded and continued. “You know I only ever came here with you when we were young because you couldn’t find the way without getting lost.”

&#x200B;

“Even so! If you knew this was happening you shouldn’t have let it go on Gil!”

&#x200B;

“Let’s work this out later.” Gil said. “ Right now we have a friend waiting for us.”

&#x200B;

“Right.”

&#x200B;

At this point we had reached the door that was letting noise litter the house. It stood slightly ajar, as the front door had, and where we stood just outside I could now make out the familiar dronings of a sci-fi show the three of us had watched as kids. We’d spent the better part of a week finishing it all. Gil reached for the door, pushed, and it opened, revealing a scene which I’ll wish to forget up until the day I die.

&#x200B;

Seth was sitting, centered, on a two seater, at the far side of the living room. Facing our side, he seemed transfixed, as he stared hypnotically at the wall mounted television I could now see to our right. He had sunken into his seat and the cushions on either side of him had both simultaneously risen in response. It was to the extent that a second set of arm rest had formed between his withering body and the originals. It almost would have been funny were it not for the bed sores rampantly sprouting up from the undersides of his twig like thighs. Coupled with the abundant patches of dead skin caked onto his body they made him the spitting image of a living cadaver. Then there were his eyes, bloodshot, dry, and wrinkling like raisins. I wondered if he ever let them close. With a croaking eagerness I spoke, eager to begin my friend's rescue, and remove him and  Boxer from this hellhole of a home.

&#x200B;

“Seth?”

&#x200B;

As I spoke he looked, with only his drying eyes, and replied.

&#x200B;

“Oh……It’s you….I was wondering when you’d come back.”His voice strained, as if the cords were calcified with disuse, and I feared that they might snap under the strain of his words, so I filled the space with my own.

&#x200B;

“I’d have come back…. a lot sooner if I’d known you were like this. Don’t worry, we’ll get you out of here, and make sure you have all the help you need to get better!”

&#x200B;

“Better? I’m fine….You’re blocking the T.V…. You need to move!”He lifted an arm to push me out of the way, and as he did I could hear the sounds of rupturing skin, followed by a smell even more potent than that which had followed the mildew. Coagulated blood ran down his under arm and as he began to push I thought I could hear the bones in his hand begin to crack. I pulled away before I could let that happen. He wasn’t going to break himself against me.

&#x200B;

“Look at yourself Seth! Turn off the fucking television and look at yourself! Your lawn looks like a jungle, the house is rotting to the core and your dog is missing, but all you want to do is sit and watch that show while your body turns into something you couldn’t even donate to science. I know I’ve been gone a long time and I’m sorry that I never called, but at least let us take you to a hospital man. Gil’s car is parked…”

&#x200B;

“Dog’s not missing.” He lazily retorted

&#x200B;

“What?” I almost didn’t want to ask, the words caught like a lump in my throat, and yet I had.

&#x200B;

“He’s right over there. Never left my side.”

&#x200B;

With a slow, half assed, motion Seth waved vaguely to the far side of the double seater. Its space had been obscured from the sole light source in the room by a heavily marred coffee table, worn out from every disrespect you could imagine, but as I drew closer I no longer needed its light. Through the dimness I could make it out, a lump under the arm rest. I reached towards it, hoping I was wrong, but my heart sank as my hand reached its destination. Just as my hand sank into the fur, into the meat, into the maggots that began slowly crawling up my hand, and the source of the rot filling the house then became apparent. I pulled back, screaming, I fell, and saw black.

&#x200B;

When I came to, I found myself sitting in the passenger side of Gils BMW. He was behind the wheel and though I was still disoriented I could tell that we were a long way from the source of the ache now radiating in my skull.

&#x200B;

“We have to go back, Gil.” As I spoke I stirred and my words came out as mumble and slur.

&#x200B;

“Oh hey you’re awake! I was starting to worry that you’d fallen into a coma buddy.” There was a hint of mockery to his voice now. Its evidence was made clear by how calm he was in the face of what we’d seen.

&#x200B;

“Seth needs serious help Gil. We need to get him out of that house before he dies in it.” As I spoke I gradually regained my faculties and my words regained their clarity.

&#x200B;

“Look.” Gill replied. “I know what you saw back there upset you, but there’s nothing we can do for him now but visit. Which you should. After all, you’re the reason he’s in there.”

&#x200B;

“What the fuck Gil! How was any of that my fault?” I’d gone from sputtering out, to ablaze with frustration, with only a matter of moments.

&#x200B;

“You doomed him to that chair when you left him like that. You know how it is with all our friends around here. It’s just in their nature to stay as you left them. They’ll never be capable of anything else.” He was so nonchalant about the whole situation that it almost sent me back in a shock.

&#x200B;

“That’s….Even if that’s true I can still try and fix this. Let me go back and fix this!”

&#x200B;

“There’s no point pal. Maybe if you’d come back to fix him sooner you could have helped Seth, but it’s been so long. He’s going to live out the rest of his existence, rotting in that chair, sitting next to that pile of rot and maggot, and looking worse for wear each time you go to look at him.”

&#x200B;

Gils words set me off at this point. There was no way I’d let what he was describing happen.

&#x200B;

“You know what? Fuck this ride and Fuck you! Pull over, I’m getting out of this car and I’m getting Seth into a hospital, even if I have to carry him the whole way there on my back.” My words came in a firm declaration, and were delivered by  a shout quickly running me out of breath.

&#x200B;

“No. You Won’t.” Gil’s retort was firm, and self assured, as if he knew he held total control.

&#x200B;

“Excuse me?” I was beyond belligerent at this point.

&#x200B;

“I said that you won’t. There’s too many other people waiting to see you and I’ve got to make sure that we touch base with all of them. I’m not pulling over, and you’re not getting out.”

&#x200B;

His words put me into shock. In an anxious frenzy I pulled out my phone, and got ready to dial 911, while shooting a glance at Gil. He had one last chance to let me out before the cops got involved and made a mess of things.

&#x200B;

“Don’t bother. They aren’t going to help you.”

&#x200B;

I laughed at what I thought was a bluff and then I dialed the police.

&#x200B;

Nobody answered.

&#x200B;

For the following fifteen minutes I dialed the numbers of every friend, every family member, coworker, and business that I knew. Nobody answered and now I’ve turned to the internet in hopes that maybe someone on here can help me out of this horrible situation. I’ve tried multiple sites, but for whatever reason this seems to be the only one I can access. With any luck I’ll be out of this scenario soon and my next post will be filled with good news. Until then, I’ll be here, stuck in a car, with my friend turned captor.

It was another cloudy night in Doyle, Massachusetts. The thick, black sheets seemed to blot out the entire sky, leaving a malevolent aura in the air. The surrounding city streets were still damp from the recent rainstorm.

The walk back home from work seemed to stretch an eternity in the gloomy weather. The weather and added stress of forgetting my keys at home left me in a dark mood.

I hoped that one of my roommates was home to buzz me in. Otherwise, it's sitting on the cold, concrete staircase until I had the chance to tailgate someone else into the apartment building.

I shivered as I zipped up my Northface jacket and braced myself for the dismal walk home.

“Hey.. uh.. you got some change?”

I looked down to see a homeless guy sitting against a nearby building holding a small cup. I could smell his musk from several feet away.

“Yeah… let me check” I pulled out a 10 dollar bill from my jacket and placed it in the cup, silently praising my own generosity.

He stared at the bill for a second in the cup, long enough to see the amount, and then peered back up at me with an annoyed expression. As if *I* was wasting *his* time.

“You’re welcome, asshole” I thought to myself as I continued on my walk. I tried to quell my rising anger, reminding myself how that interaction likely had a lot more to do with him than me.

I continued my walk for several minutes, so preoccupied thinking about the ungrateful beggar that I barely noticed the reflection of a hooded figure on the corner of a nearby window

I instinctively turn around to see the black shape walking a safe distance behind me. It was still too dark to see his face but I could see his outfit- black joggers and a grey hoodie

I turn around and pick up my pace; to my relief, he begins to cross the street and take a right turn out of view.

I start a podcast on my headphones and continue several blocks down the street.

“True crime podcasts are a dangerous idea while walking home alone at night”  I chuckle to myself. I shivered at the thought of being one of the characters in tonight’s episode- A drug addicted wife attempts to poison her husband for the insurance money.

As I turn a corner I see another person behind me, about to do the same. He appeared to be the same hooded figure I saw before… on my side of the street again.

“What do you want?” I shout from the street corner. I made sure to leave a healthy distance between us in case I needed to bolt.

“Sorry about that” A silky smooth voice calls back. It was deep and had the cadence of a radio host.

“I was lost and was wondering if I could ask you for directions back to Cheshire Square”

Against my better judgment I took the extra time to give him the directions. My apartment was only a few blocks away and the area was generally pretty busy. What’s the worst he could do?

“Yeah, sure,” I said quickly. I was trying to be nice, but I did find the man’s voice unsettling and wanted to get moving soon.

“Turn around and go back the way you came, take a left down the path that cuts through the garden, and then take another left on…” I realized that the path would take him right back to the street he diverted to when I first noticed him.

At that moment, a tall cloaked man ran out of a nearby alley and lunged at me with something metallic.

I wasn’t able to make out his features too well but noticed  he was wearing a plain white mask and had long, spindly fingers.

Time seemed to slow down as I dodged him to the right, narrowly avoiding getting stabbed in the arm. I was able to see what he tried to hit me with…

A needle.

Adrenaline instantly flooded my body and I ran. I could hear the two chase me in close pursuit.

I have always been a strong runner and only needed to get a few blocks in order to make it to my apartment. The fear of not knowing the needle’s contents pushed me to an even faster pace.

The ground was slippery and I could tell my assailants were having trouble catching up with me…

I gave every last ounce of strength to increase the gap as I sprinted back to my building. Once I made it, I planned to buzz every door and get the attention of the whole apartment. That and the bright, motion-activated flood lights outside my building would have to keep them away. If not, all I needed would be for one person to press the ‘door open’ button in their room and I would be inside.

Several seconds passed as the men chased me down the street, I could see the outline of my building get closer as the sounds of their footsteps grew more distant.

I flew towards the front of the building and immediately ran my fingers down every button to buzz the 20+ rooms in the building; making sure to press my own room’s button several extra times.

I turned around to see the outline of *just* the masked man behind my apartment’s floodlights. He wasn't moving any closer. The absence of his accomplice had me even more on edge- my eyes darted around the perimeter searching for his presence.

“Get the fuck out of here” I screamed, “my roommates will be down here any second.”

Without turning away from him, I checked the door one more time. Still closed.

He produced and unfolded a small rifle from his cloak. I could barely make out the unusual shape of the gun; It had an abnormally wide barrel.

I heard three pulses of gas emit from the gun and saw three tiny, metal needles zip through the air towards me. I immediately fell to the ground for cover. Glass from the windows behind me cracked open from the shots.

I heard the buzz of the apartment door unlocking and immediately swung it open and sprinted into the lobby.

My two roommates met me downstairs, as well as many other neighbors shuffling down to see what the commotion was.

“What happened?” my roommate Sam shouted as he began dialing 911 on my phone.

“I was…..shot at” I gasped between breaths. “I don’t think they hit me”

I began feeling lightheaded, which I assumed was from my adrenaline rush beginning to wear off.

“Jesus, that was close! I don’t know if they’re out there guys, be careful”

My other roommate, Tracy, slowly walked to me, horror painting his features as he noticed a small syringe firmly embedded in my left thigh.

“Percy, wh-at did they shoot at you with?” He stuttered

As I peered down to see the needle, I was instantly hit by a tidal wave of what I could only describe as peace.

Love and understanding washed over me as I opened my eyes to see what could only be god gazing back at me. He told me humanity would be safe and he was watching over us.

I opened my eyes again to the warm lighting of the apartment lobby.

Why were there so many people here? I recognized Sam and Tracy but who was everyone else? I wasn’t sure, but I somehow knew they all felt immense love and compassion for me. I felt the exact same bond with each and every one of them as well.

I closed my eyes, almost able to visualize the bright, orange glow emanating from the room. Other colors began to join in as well. Red and blue lights were added to the orange, creating a dazzling light show.

As I drifted off into a peaceful slumber, I faintly heard a voice speak into a radio.

“10-52 possible drug overdose.”

…

It's been some time since this incident. I learned through the nurses that I was injected with a shot of pure heroin. After the hospital ran a battery of tests to ensure there were no infections, I was sent home with not much more than sad smiles and the medical staff’s condolences.

Despite the best efforts of the many witnesses and the city police, no one was able to find the masked man or his accomplice. I wasn’t able to get a good enough description so my accounts weren’t of much help either. I quickly began to learn how difficult it was to find a first-time offender with no discernable motive or relationship to the victim

It was simply ruled a random act of ‘violence’ from someone who was soon dubbed by locals as “The Needle Man” after news of the incident got around.

The Needle Man visited my apartment again, a few weeks after this incident. I heard a quiet tap at my window at 2 or 3 in the morning- It didn’t wake me up as I had barely been able to sleep since our first encounter.

I opened my window and followed him outside into the chilling night air. I was able to get a much closer look this time.

I noticed how tall he actually was as he stared down at me with that expressionless white mask. His long limbs and fingers seemed to sway back and forth in the faint moonlight. The skin underneath his cloak appeared grey and rotten, covered with deep red sores.

I felt no fear, not even anger. Only an insatiable hunger.

He *handed* me the needle this time. I Imagined the heavenly sensation I experienced in my apartment lobby, as well as how it was so cruelly ripped away from me.

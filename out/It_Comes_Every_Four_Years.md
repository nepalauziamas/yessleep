It Comes Every Four Years

Hi, I’m Connor. I'm in 8th grade. I'm 14 years old and I live in Wakefield, Illinois where It comes every four years. In my neighborhood, I go to a school named Westbridge. I wasn’t the most popular kid there or the most academically successful either, but I at least had a B in all of my classes. 

In my 1st-period class, there was this guy named Alex. Alex has freaked the fuck out and he was rambling about how the four-year mark was up and that someone was going to go missing again. I vaguely remember when I was like 6 my best friend went missing and was never heard from or seen again. But despite me remembering that I still wanted proof of what Alex was talking about. Alex says out of breath “Oh-oh-ok umm… My parents told me that they received a stone with an X dashed across the middle and they knew that they had to tell me what was going to happen to me. They said that I was in great danger because It was coming for me. They don’t know why It chose me but It did and that I was going to be taken from my home and I was never going to be heard from again. They said that every four years a mysterious creature comes and takes one of the kids that are under 18. It leaves a stone with an X and the doorstep of someone's house and then 4 days later he comes to take you and there's nothing you can do about it. At all. On the fifth day of the week you are never going to return and you are never going to be heard of again.

2 Days Later

It is the 12 of June and I’m in my 3rd hour class Language Arts which I also have with Alex. Who was growing more and more paranoid because he was in fear of getting taken. We started to talk about what he was going to do. I asked him, “Alex what are you going to do about this whole situation?” 
Alex replies “Ummm.. idk I mean I can’t really do anything because no-one in the history of living in this town has escaped it.”
I respond to Alex sympathetically “I’m sorry about your situation and I wish that there was something I could do to help”
Alex says with sadness in his tone “Yeah I know. It’s fine”
I responded “Ok Alex. Okay.”

Later That Day

I decided to ask my parents about the mysterious creature that comes every four years and they said confirmed everything that Alex had said from the stone being left on the door to It coming to take you in the dead of night on the fifth day of the week and you never being heard from or seen again. 

Three Days Later

After I had the conversation with Alex I mean I was worried for him but now’s not the time I still don’t know if what everyone is saying is true. In my first period class I got there and Alex wasn’t there. I instantly knew that what Alex and my parents said was all true. And to be completely honest I’m gonna miss Alex and I will try to remember him for as long as I can. 

Later That Night

I was just chilling in my room and all of the sudden all of the street lights started to flicker an the air from my window started to feel extra cold so I went outside to see what was going on and why the lights were flickering and why the air was so damn cold I went outside and what I saw shocked me to my core what I saw wa terrifying. I saw something that was wearing torn back robes and I tried to make out the face of the creature but it looked like his face was just a skull. That's all I could make out from the flickering lights. He was walking forward and then he stopped. Right at Alex's house and then he walked through the door and then all I heard was screaming from his house and then it just stopped. Then  the creature walked through the door again and It just disappeared. Next time I’m at school I need to tell someone about this and I knew exactly who I was gonna tell. I need to tell my best friend. His name is Gray who is 13


3 Years Later

“Merry Christmas everyone!” My mom shouted with her camera in her hand recording everyone while they opened their presents. After the Christmas party was over I had to go to school after the weekend was over.

6 Months Later

It’s June specifically, it's June 9th one day before it leaves the stone with the X dashed across the middle and then 4 days later he will take someone and make them disappear forever.

The Next Day

Today is the day that It will leave the stone with the X dashed across the middle and I have to stop it from taking them away. This is my last year at Westbridge High and I’m 18 now. It's been four years since my classmate Alex sady got taken by It. After I got to school I saw my best friend Gray in complete worry. So I walked up to him and asked him what's wrong and he reached his hand into his backpack and what he pulled out shocked me to my core. He pulled out a rock with an X dashed across the middle and I knew what I had to do. I had to get him out of town. 

After school I was gonna get all of my money enough to get an apartment away from this stupid town. School is over and I can’t wait to get home and get me and my friend out of town. I won’t let It take my best friend from me. I got home from school and I instantly went to the bank and took out enough money to buy a small apartment that was at least big enough for me and my friend to live in. I told Gray about this and he was so happy when I told him that we could leave town by the end of the night. That night, I drove to Gray’s house and I knocked on his window and he came out of the window and he got into my car and we started to drive. We are a little bit aways from the exit of town. I checked the time and it was exactly 12:00am. Then the street lights started to flicker and the air started to grow colder. Then I looked up and I was horrified when I saw the black figure wearing black torn robes start to slowly walk toward the car. 

I yelled “NO IT CAN’T BE HAPPENING. IT’S TOO EARLY. 3 DAYS TOO EARLY.” I slammed my foot on the gas pedal. Accelerating going faster and faster. Gray screamed “CHRISTIAN SLOW DOWN. NOW!” I pushed on the gas pedal even harder as the creature approached and then. I thought I was about to make contact with It and then he just passed through the car and the side of my car hit a power line pole and I scitted out and then It started to walk toward the now crashed car. “NO. STOP. GO AWAY. I WON’T LET YOU TAKE MY FRIEND FROM ME. PLEASE STOP.” I screamed at the creature who was so close to the car. “PLEASE STOP. GO AWAY. PLEASE DON’T TAKE MY FRIEND FROM ME.” I cried. Then It got to the car. It reached for the door so I locked it. It started to pull faster and faster as the street lights started to flicker faster and faster as each second passed then the lights shut off. Then Gray started to scream as loud as ever “STOP. GET YOUR GODDAMN HANDS OFF OF ME.” Gray started to hit the creature. 

I could hear thud thud thud as Gray screamed and cried for the creature to let him go and leave him alone. And then all of it stopped, the screaming stopped the noise of Gray hitting the monster. Then the lights came back on and the air started to warm up again and I instantly knew that Gray was gone. Just like Alex.

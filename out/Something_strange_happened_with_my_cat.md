So I (14f) went out to the living room to study and my cat Blaze followed me like he usually does. We both sat on the couch together for about an hour while I was trying to complete some work for my history class but then, I got thirsty. I got up to go to the fridge but when I looked back to my room for a split second my cat Blaze was there. I looked to the couch that I was just on and he was there too. 

At this point, I’m pretty terrified so I rushed to my moms room since it was the closest place and I was there the day before, puking my guts out. I sat next to her and whispered to her “Hey mom, I don’t want to startle you but are two Blazes.” I looked back at the Blaze on the couch for a second and now, he has a human grin on his face, like human lips and teeth it was pretty uncanny, so I whispered to my mom again and said “and he has a human grin…”. 

At this point my mom was completely confused plus it does sound kind of dumb, not to mention that I’ve been known to have nightmares. My mom told me it was just a nightmare and I should go back to sleep. I’m going to sleep right now (or at least trying to.) but I just thought I share this here because it’s kinda funny how my mind works. 

EDIT: It wasn’t a dream. 

I’m currently writing this the next night as I’ve had time to process what happened to me. A little after I told my mom about Blaze and went to sleep I woke up with a chill down my spine and was already terrified because of what happened before, so I looked back to the couch and my cat(?) Blaze is standing upright on the back of the couch on two legs, not four. 

I go back to my mom and try to whisper, though I’m pretty sure it didn’t come out as one and say “ It wasn’t a dream.”

 I start hiding under my blanket (I’m sorry I know I would die in a horror movie but it’s just what I do when I’m scared.) then I hear the door loudly slam shut. I peek out from the blanket and watch as my mom goes to open the door followed by hearing her shout just before I hear my cats cries of pain. 

My mom was kicking the cat/thing when it bit deep into her foot. She was overtaken with pain and just stood there screaming. I decided that I needed to help too, and I reached under the bed, grabbed the bat and swung it unto the creature as he pulled back from my moms foot with a huge portion of flesh dangling from its mouth. 

After I hit the creature a couple more times it’s head became concave but somehow, it still fought. I kept swinging and nearly cried with every motion because in the end, this was my cat. (or at least a creature that looked and sounded like him.) Me and my mom took turns trying to make rid of this thing until finally after what felt like eternity it was just a bag of flesh, skin, and bone. We dumped the body outside and still don’t know the cause of it.

Right now I’m sitting next to hopefully the real Blaze but I thought I would just share my experience here because I needed to tell some people. I might have not summarized it the best way because I might still be in shock.

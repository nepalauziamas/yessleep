I work part time at a daycare,and to be honest I only took the job for the money. I don’t particularly like kids,I think they're gross and I’m not a very optimistic person,so y’know,I wouldn’t be the best parent anyways. But I mean the job pays really well for being part time,and I need the money. So I took the job.

The daycare place  I work at is in a little christen school a few minutes away from my apartment. My shift starts at 9:00 A.M to 4:00 P.M. pretty decent hours,plus I get to sleep in. So I thought that this job would be a breeze,and for the most part it was. I like my coworkers,and the kids I work with are pretty chill. The thing I don’t like is chapell it's like an hour and a half of sitting down and getting back up again. And as a non-religious person,I hated it. So I would leave,Well I would be there for the first 5 minutes then go wait out in the little waiting area? The school I work in calls it the “fellowship hall” I dunno.

Moving on when this happened I had been working at the daycare late,because some dumbass parent came to pick their kid up half wasted. And I couldn’t let a kid go home with a drunk driver so I offered to drive the kid home myself. This may seem odd but the parent was already on my last nerve and I wanted to go home. During the ride to this kids house they were telling-well more like begging me to drop them off at their Moms house (their dad came to pick them up). And I didn’t want to deal with a crying kid in my back seat,so they told me the address and I texted the dad (I have all of the parents numbers for emergencies). And when I arrived at this kids Mom’s house I about fainted. This kid's mom was a total gold digger. Her new husband was like twice her age and totally loaded. But that's for another time. 

When I got out of the car to walk the kiddo up to the door. Their mom answered,they went in,blah blah blah. Anyways I got home at 11:00 P.M, And went straight to bed. I woke up at 3:00 A,M. to crying,it sounded like a small child was crying in my living room. I knew that my neighbors had kids, But they were teens and honestly,they were pretty cool to be around. And sometimes they would come up to my apartment pretty late if their parents were fighting. I got up slowly, my body aching,and sore unprepared for the day ahead. And as I shuffled into my living room,I saw a crib in the middle of the room. I rubbed my eyes,once,then twice,then again. It was still there. The crying didn’t get any louder or any quieter when I paced around my apartment. It was like an echo following me. 

Desperately trying to figure out why there was a crib with a possible baby IN MY LIVING ROOM. I was convinced I was going insane. I decided to just let whatever was crying cry and go get some coffee at the 7-11 across the street. I slid on my shoes and grabbed my jacket,and I left. The 7-11 cashier seemed more tired than I did. He tried to do his fake cashier voice,but decided it wasn’t worth it and let out his ordinary scratchy voice that I was used to. 

When I left the 7-11 I noticed my door was open. This had happened before but I was sure I closed the door (my door sucks at closing so I got an extra lock). I still ran up the stairs and when I ran into my apartment the crib was gone. There was now a woman standing in my entrance. I was so startled by this I splashed burning hot coffee all over my shirt. The burning was the least of my problems right now. I ran up to the woman and I tried to tap her on her shoulder,but my hand went right through her. Shivers followed up my arm and down my spine. I was frozen in place,the woman vanished,right in front of my eyes. I was frozen there for maybe another 10 minutes before gathering my thoughts, I then decided that I should just go and watch t.v on my couch. And to let this “mishap” sort itself out. The noises from the t.v jumbled together as I drifted off into some weird sort of sleep. It's almost like daydreaming but you're so exhausted  you can't keep your eyes open,so you just have all of your thoughts dancing around in your mind.

I couldn’t tell what time it was but now I was laying down. I could hear knocking on my door,and sirens outside roaring. I couldn't tell what was happening but I couldn’t open my eyes,something wasn’t letting me. It was like a grown adult was laying on my body. I could move my fingers and my head side to side,but I couldn’t open my eyes,I couldn’t see,I couldn’t even sit up. What was going on? The air was hot on my face but cold on the rest of my body. What was happening?! It-it was like someone-or something was breathing on my face. The hot air had a putrid kind of smell,the kind of smell you would imagen rotting flesh to smell like. The kocking became more persistent,I could still hear the tv in the background,someone was saying my name. I couldn’t tell if it was coming from through the door,or through the t.v or maybe it was coming from whatever was holding me down. 

The knocking turned into bangging,louder,and louder, crashing accrued somewhere in my apartment,I was unsure where it was coming from. I heard feet,running,yelling right above me, Yelling something I couldn’t understand,I tried to speak but my mouth wouldn’t open. Sharp pains washed over my face and body. The putrid smell disappeared into a distant memory. I wanted so badly to scream for help,to scream for someone that may have already been in my apartment. But only muffled noises came out. 

I woke up on a hospital bed two days ago. I could open my eyes,but it felt like they were glossed over with water as if I had been crying,but no matter how many times I blinked it didn’t go away. A nurse came rushing in and told me to stop blinking, they never explained why but I followed her directions. The nurse had a mirror with her,and she handed it to me. I saw red bloody scabs above my lips and bollow. My under eyes had some sort of glue on them,and my eyelashes had been removed.  The scabs looked like a pin,or needles had been stabbed into my mouth. They were small puncture wounds. My eyes looked bloodshot. My pupils were extremely small,unnaturally small. It looked like I was a cursed doll or something. I was honestly scared of myself. 

I’m still trying to figure out what happened to me. The doctors or the police that drove me back home,they never told me what happened.

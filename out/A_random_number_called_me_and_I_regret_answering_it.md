I was sitting outside a cafe on a bench. It was dark outside, and the crickets in the bushes were annoying me.

I had recently gotten in a fight with my friend Aspen. We were arguing about our other alcoholic friend, Everett. He had previously punched someone, and needed to be bailed out of jail.

Aspen wanted us to split the bail to get him out. Except, she didn’t know I was in debt. I hadn’t told anyone except my roommate and another one of my high school friends Leo. I told her nicely that I just didn’t have the money and she broke down all of a sudden. I didn’t understand why she had to be so emotional about money.

My phone vibrated and the loud ringer disturbed my spacing out. It was Aspen. I really needed her to understand why I couldn’t help, so I answered. 

“Aspen,” I start talking. I could hear her breath hitching on the opposite side of the line. “If I had the money, I would help. Right now, you’ll need to find someone else who can bail him out. I just can’t do anything in this situation.” 

Her annoyed sigh was heard over the line. “You need to be more responsible with your money, Ivan!” She screamed. “When our friends need us the most, you nope out of a situation because ’you don’t have money’. You can’t even provide money for yourself? It’s not hard to get a job and work for your own money, you financially dependent jerk.”

I try to remain calm but I couldn’t. I closed my eyes. “Oh well Aspen, I don’t see you shitting money out your ass either.” I hear her gasp at my remark.” You’re not rich, you barely have money yourself. It’s your boyfriend who got into a fight on his own. You can bail him out yourself. Maybe you should get more customers at your family business for extra money. But no one really wants to see you take their order because of that resting bitch face. I don’t blame them. No wonder you’re not successful. You couldn’t even become a doctor because everyone knows you’d kill someone during the surgery.” I say before i stop myself.

The sobbing on the other side of the phone made me realize what I said was horrible. “Fuck you Ivan.” Her voice wavered.

My eyes go wide. “Wait Aspen, I’m-“ she hung up. 

I throw my phone on the ground angrily and lay across the bench while I covered my face. I wondered what was wrong with me. Why I said all those things even though I knew she was right. I guess the truth hurts. It hurts a lot. 

I looked over at my phone that was lying with the screen facing the ground. I silently curse as i just left it there for a few seconds. I knew messed it up really badly. I felt horrible. I continued to lay on the bench as I heard the cricket noises get louder as the world became quiet.

I looked up at the sky and waited. I waited for maybe a call back from her but I had some doubts. 


Finally, the phone on the ground a few feet away from me rang. I smiled. I thought I could finally actually apologize, but also I was glad it wasn’t broken.

I got up from my position and quickly walked over to my phone, thinking it was Aspen calling me.

I wished it was Aspen.

I answered the phone without looking at the contact.

“Aspen!! Please don’t hang up, I really want to-“ I began to say before I was cut off.

“Ivan Mies?” A small, wavering feminine voice interrupted me.

I raise an eyebrow. This wasn’t Aspen. She had a deeper voice, and she’d also never address me with My full name. I looked at the contact and it was just a random number I’ve never seen. Well, it looked similar, but it wasn’t saved in my contacts so I couldn’t have known it.

“Hello…? Who is this?” I reply. “And how do you know my my name?”

A soft giggle was heard on the other end of the line. “You probably don’t remember me, but…” then there was silence. I pulled my phone away but the person was still there. 

I could hear heavy breathing but also other weird noises. 

“Who is this?” I repeat myself, making sure the woman heard the demanding tone. I was terrified a random person knew my name. 

The weird noises stopped. And the voice finally answered me back. “It’s June! June Desai!” The voice was now energetic and bubbly. 

It took everything in me to not drop my phone again. I couldn’t believe it. 
June Desai… my ex girlfriend in high school. The one that went missing, and was never found. The one…

“The June you killed!” She finished my thought. 

“How are yo-“ I stop myself as I hear ruffling come from the bushes behind me, near the bench I was just sitting at. I didn’t realize what was behind the cafe. 

“Do you remember where you drowned me, Ivan? If not, I’d like to give you a little reminder.” Her voice giggled. But, I didn’t hear the voice from the phone. 

Instead, it was coming from the bushes.

I hear water dripping, but there was no rain or any running water anywhere in sight. 

“Lake Richen.” I reply. I look over to the big sign next to the cafe.

‘Come swimmin’ at Lake Richen!’

I heard the call end on my phone and my screen went black. I couldn’t turn it on at all.

“Did you miss me at all, Ivan?” Her whisper travelled to me. It brought a shiver down my spine.

“How are you alive?” I asked her. I was horrified. 

“There isn’t an answer to every question.” June aggressively stated.” The bottom of the lake was a comfortable spot. Care to join me down there babe?” 

I sprint to my car, hoping this was just a dream. I started my car and drove. Quickly, but also safely. 

I couldn’t believe my eyes. She was talking to me. It sounded just like her. It had to be her. It was so real, and so horrifying how I imagined that whole thing.

I passed it off as a day dream. My imagination was very creative. 

As I got home, I took off my shoes and ran to my bedroom. Just in case. I locked all my doors and windows.

I finally got to relax and jumped in bed.


As I laid there, I felt damp cushioning under me, and smelled dirty water coming from the opposite side I was facing. 

Before I could turn, I felt a wet, slimy blue arm wrap around me. I felt a chin placed on my right shoulder.

“I missed you so much dear.” Junes voice whispered.

This story happened two weeks ago.

A friend of mine, let's call him Dan, came to stay with me for the night. he didn't arrive until around 11 in the evening, when he was there we went gaming for about an hour, when we were done Dan came up with the idea of sleeping outside in the backyard because it was so hot inside, so I said yes. There was a big air mattress in the attic that we went to get, and in the attic the first weird thing happened. In the attic it was very dark and the power in the attic wasn't working, so I said to Dan 'I'm going to go get the flashlight real quick', he looked at me for ten seconds and then he told me to pay attention because it was cold, I didn't pay that much attention because he had gotten a sunstroke that day so he wasn't so clear already. I hadn't been able to find a flashlight so I went back to the attic and we brought the airbed to the backyard. After 15 minutes we had everything settled and we started chatting a bit, but what I noticed was he didn't talk much anymore, and when he talked it was only answers of my questions, and they were superficial answers without further explanation, the answers were just yes or no. To my mind his appearance seemed very tired but inside he was still full of energy, because after half an hour of checking my social media I went to try to sleep, I asked Dan if he was going to sleep too, he said nothing, so I asked again "Dan are you going to sleep too?" he said he was going to sleep after me, I didn't care at all because I was dead tired.

I remember this part very well

I woke up at 3:30am to the sound of some sort of tapping, Dan was banging my cat's head against the edge of our pool, I got up like a bolt of lightning, I yelled what the fuck are you doing!? He stopped bashing my cat's skull against the pool and dropped it. He told me it had gotten too cold, I didn't understand what he meant and at the moment I wanted to kill him, so I ran at him, to my surprise he didn't do anything, he didn't try to defend himself, that scared me. I quietly walked backwards until I was about three feet away from him. I was shaking all over, but I tried to keep myself up. Neither of us said anything until he fell down on the air mattress, by which time my mother had also heard everything. We called the police, and 10 minutes later when they got there they woke Dan up, and started talking to him. The conversation lasted about half an hour, and what the police told us I will never forget, they told us that Dan was sleepwalking at the moment. He had an Apple watch on, they had looked at his sleep pattern and it said he was sleeping from ten thirty until four o'clock, I didn't believe it. I was also allowed to speak to Dan, he told me he couldn't remember anything about tonight, and he didn't even believe he had killed my cat. Dan said that everything that had happened tonight that he had dreamed.

Now that I am writing this story it has transpired that Dan was sleepwalking from 10:30 until 4:00. We have a camera of our own hanging in the backyard, and in it you can see Dan walking circles around our pool almost all the time. It's not a fable that you shouldn't wake up people who are sleepwalking. Dan was wearing tattered sweatpants, and as he was walking circles around the pool, a loose wire was hanging against the ground, and my cat ran up to it because cats do that, eventually he jumped on Dan and startled him. He got aggressive and slammed him against the pool, and so then I woke up. It turns out that it's dangerous to try to wake someone who is sleepwalking, and that's why this happened.

What I will never understand is that he was already sleeping since 10:30 while he was at my home at 11:00.

In the meantime, it is now two weeks later

his trial was pronounced two days ago, he was not convicted because there is evidence that he was not conscious at the time, but he has to pay one thousand euros compensation to us and he is getting therapy on how to control his sleepwalking better.

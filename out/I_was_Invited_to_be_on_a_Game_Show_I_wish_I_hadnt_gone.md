*"Dear Maddox. You have been chosen to be on an up-and-coming game show called Mr. Davidson's Game Show. Congrats! The show will be a very high-budget project, in front of a large, but minimalistic crowd of people. You will be competing against 3 other people for the chance to win $100k. You will be required to get here at 5:50 PM before the show airs. We're very excited to see you on set tonight!*

*\~ Mr. Davidson."*

I read the letter I had just received in my mailbox. A new game show was going to air later, and I was invited to be on it? This was too good to be true. At the same time, it seemed pretty sketchy, but the thought of winning 100 thousand dollars eased into my mind and sounded really nice. I was already running low on money, and I needed that cash.

I took the letter and walked back into my house, laying it on my kitchen counter. I picked up my phone and looked up "Mr. Davidson's Game Show" on Safari. From the looks of it, it did seem like it did exist, and this wasn't some sort of scam.

At the same time, I continued to question the legitimacy of this, wondering if it was worth going or not. I checked the address for the studio that was provided on the back of the letter and looked it up on google maps, and it wasn't too far away.

I looked at the bills and rent that was due on the couch. I didn't have the money to pay it, and I wouldn't have the money for a long time, but I'd be long evicted by the time I did. The $100k prize would be able to pay for all of it with no problem. I checked the time; 9:36 AM. I had time to get ready for it.

I decided to go.

The rest of that day was spent planning and getting ready. While I was nervous, I was also confident that I'd be able to outplay and outperform 3 other people, even if I didn't know what would be present on the show. I knew I'd be on TV, so I showered longer than I typically do. I brushed my teeth longer too.

I tried to pick the best outfit I could put together, but I just decided to go wearing a white shirt and black jeans. I even called my family and some friends and told them about the whole ordeal. Some were skeptical about it but understood my desire and need for the $100k. I actually wasn't sure what I'd do with the rest of the money after I paid everything off, maybe give some to charity and help pay my parent's house off, perhaps.

The thought was circulating through my mind when I got in my car and started it up. I put the address to the show on my GPS as I pulled out of my driveway. I was excited to meet this Mr. Davidson guy, considering he seemed nice in the letter he wrote to me. As I drove out of my neighborhood, the fact that I was going to be on TV made my heart beat fast. It was a surreal feeling, I'll tell you that much.

After about a 50-minute drive, I finally made it to the location. I pulled up to a hill surrounded by multiple trees and nothing else in sight. I drove farther and saw the building come farther into view. It was *huge,* I'm talking 500 feet of land it took up. While there was a certain eerie and unconventional vibe that I was getting in this area, it was really a sight to see. There were hundreds of cars parked around it, too.

I found a parking spot around the back of the studio and got out. I didn't actually know where I needed to go, and I began to get nervous. To my luck, though, I saw a man that I presumed was Mr. Davidson open the back door and poke his head out, and looked at me. He smiled.

"You must be Maddox then, huh?" Mr. Davidson yells to me with nothing but joy in his voice, maybe a little bit too much joy. I moved my head around, taking in the obscene scenery of the trees and the lack of anything else in the setting.

"Um, yeah, that's me," I yell back, raising my hand a bit. Mr. Davidson motions his hand over to him. I began jogging to the door as it was quite far away. Once I made it to the door, I took a better look at Mr. Davidson.

He had neat, combed-back hair, and a blue suit with blue pants. His smile was so wide that I thought his cheekbones were going to break by the second, and his teeth were ghostly white. He had a nice, yet direful smile.

A smile that wouldn't go away for the rest of the night.

Mr. Davidson adjusted his suit, his smile not going away as he lead me down a long hallway. I looked around the building as we moved. The walls were rather colorful along the way. The back seemed to just be technical rooms to make the show look better, but as we made it to the middle of the building was when I noticed a *gigantic* room that was covered up, so I couldn't see in. I was interested in seeing what the room was, and I was hoping that during the show, we'd be able to go in and check it out.

So far, the inside of the studio looked great, with no red flags present yet.

Mr. Davidson eventually took a turn and opened a door, and made way for me to get in. I thanked him and walked in, noticing that he still had the same exact smile on his face.

When I walked into the room, it was pretty big in width. I examined it more and realized that this was the prep room that we'd be in before the show. I noticed 3 other people in a group just feet away from me as Mr. Davidson walked into the room, clapping his hands together.

"Alright, contestants! We're in for a very fun and enjoyable night, so all 4 of you can introduce yourselves to each other, if you will!" Mr. Davidson gleefully says.

I walked closer to them somewhat awkwardly as a woman from the group stepped forward and offered her hand. I took it and shook it.

"Maddox," I introduced myself to her as she steps back. She smiles.

"Tina," She introduces herself back, sounding relatively happy and excited. I looked at the 2 other guys, and they introduced themselves to me.

"Good luck tonight. I'm Chris, by the way," One of them says, shaking my hand. The other slaps me lightly on the back.

"Just call me Pat," He says, stepping back. I couldn't help but smile. They all seemed like really nice people, and it looked like I was... Going to have fun.

Mr. Davidson moves closer to us. "Glad we could all be nice to one another!" He remains the smile on his face, which was starting to weird me out by that point. "We're about to go... Live in a second! So let's go to the stage and get the show rolling," Mr. Davidson oddly hesitates before saying that sentence.

"Wait, you didn't say in the letter what we were gonna do on the show," Chris points out. He was right, Mr. Davidson didn't provide any actual details about the show. I look back at Davidson as the smile that was on his face began to wither away slowly, before it immediately came back.

"My apologies, Chris, I really should have done that! We're just going to have some challenges, and we'll see who wins!" Mr. Davidson yet again gleefully says, motioning us to follow him. We comply and follow him out of the room.

"He seems kind of weird..." Tina whispers to all of us. I nodded slightly in agreement.

"I don't know, he seems like a nice guy, y'know. His outfit's kinda goofy, though," Pat chuckles. We catch up to Mr. Davidson beside a curtain as I began to hear the sound of people cheering and clapping from the other side. I realized shortly that we were about to go live and go out to the stage.

"Oh, shit," I mutter. Chris laughs.

"I don't know you, but you seem chill. Don't get too nervous now," He says to me. I shrug in response.

"You're not nervous?" I say back to him as Mr. Davidson starts to open the curtain. Chris nods his head at me.

"I can't even lie, I'm fucking terrified, dude," I hear Chris gulp. I didn't know what else to say after that, so I stayed silent.

Mr. Davidson walked out to the stage, and we heard the crowd explode upon seeing him. It was almost *deafening* how loud the reaction was. I almost had to cover my ears.

"Thank you, thank you everybody, and I can't thank you enough for being here!" I hear Mr. Davidson talk into a microphone as the crowd continues to cheer. "But I'm not going to keep everyone waiting. Everyone, please welcome the contestants!" Mr. Davidson yells into the mic as the curtain opens for us.

I was frozen in place for a second before everyone else walked onto the stage. I quickly followed behind.

I looked at the crowd, and I was in awe. Every seat was packed, and while there were fewer seats than there would be when you're in a movie theatre, the energy everyone in the crowd had made up for it. I looked behind me at the set. There was a huge sign that read "Mr. Davidson's Game Show," with 3 seats and confetti coming out the side of the stage. It was a fantastic set, I must admit.

One thing I was confused by though; why was there 3 seats instead of 4?

I saw Chris, Pat, and Tina notice this too as I looked at Mr. Davidson, who still had that smile on his face laughing with the crowd. He adjusted his suit again and noticed me looking at him.

"Uh, Mr. Davidson, just a question. If there's 4 of us, why is there only 3 seats up here?" I ask him. He puts the microphone back up to his mouth, the smile remaining on his face.

"Because we're going to start our first challenge right now! Someone is going to be eliminated fast!" Mr. Davidson cheerfully says into the microphone. I stepped back and figured the answer made sense. I was getting more excited. The energy was unreal on the stage.

Mr. Davidson continued where he left off when talking to me. "Our first game is simple, but I think it will be fun. We're going to play Duck Duck Goose!" Mr. Davidson walks behind us delightedly. The crowd explodes once more at what he said. Mr. Davidson makes us form a horizontal line for the game. I looked at Pat, who was next to me.

"Duck Duck Goose?" Pat disappointingly says. "That shit's lame..."

Mr. Davidson looks at him right as he says that. "What was that?" He says into his microphone, the smile remaining on his face, but the cheerfulness no longer in his voice. Pat looks up at him, startled. I was too. I was so used to Mr. Davidson always being happy already that his sudden tone switch in his voice actually kind of scared me.

"Nothing, sorry," Pat responds to him, laughing nervously.

"Good! We can get going with the game," The joy returns to Mr. Davidson's voice as he proceeds to get behind the line, starting with me.

"Duck..." He moves on to Pat. "Duck..." He moves on to Tina. "Duck..." He moves on to Chris. "Duck!" He starts to move all the way back to me. I felt myself starting to get uncomfortable, yet thrilled at the opportunity to be on a show. I looked at the crowd and smiled at them and at the cameras, that I saw were pointing at me.

Mr. Davidson puts a hand on my shoulders. "Duck..." He moves on to Pat. "Duck..." He moves on to Tina. "Duck..." He moves onto Chris but pauses before saying anything. I took a peek at the end of the line where Mr. Davidson was with Chris and saw him looking directly at the back of Chris' head with no other expression on his face other than the same damn smile. I noticed that Mr. Davidson was moving his hand to the pocket of his suit.

I sensed confusion and impatience from Tina and Pat, but I saw that Chris had nervousness written all over his face.

There continues to be silence from Mr. Davidson before he finally says, "Goose."

I see Chris start to get disappointed at being chosen at the goose, meaning he was eliminated, but before I could react, I watched as Mr. Davidson pulls out a knife from his suit pocket and stabs Chris in the back.

I gasped at the sight as Mr. Davidson jams the knife farther into Chris' back as he yells out in agony. Mr. Davidson gets him to the ground as the crowd starts clapping loudly. I looked at the crowd in disgust. How could they clap to this? How was this airing on TV? I looked at Pat and Tina, who were also horrified at this sight.

Mr. Davidson pulls the knife out of Chris' back, with blood spilled everywhere on Chris, with Chris attempting to crawl off the stage desperately. I saw Mr. Davidson laugh as he slowly follows Chris, and stabs Chris in the back again, killing him that time.

The crowd continues to clap as Mr. Davidson wipes the blood off the knife with his hands and puts it back in his suit pocket, kicking Chris off the stage and walking back to us. I was terrified, I didn't want to move. I couldn't believe this was being aired live on television. I was just... Still.

"Chris has been eliminated, leaving the rest of you as the final 3!" Mr. Davidson says with so much happiness in his voice that it scared me even more than when he killed Chris. I still couldn't move.

I heard Tina try to say something, but no words were able to come out of her mouth. Mr. Davidson chuckled at the crowd clapping and cheering for him. I looked closer at the crowd and saw nearly every person smiling, smiling like a murder hadn't just happened. It freaked me out and disturbed me.

"For our next quick game before the main event, I need the rest of you contestants to go sit in one of those seats there," Mr. Davidson commands us. We listen immediately, turning around and walking towards the chairs. I hear Mr. Davidson speak again to the crowd from behind me, saying; "That's right, no..." Mr. Davidson hesitates again as I feel his eyes pressed on us. "...Commercial breaks tonight,"

Right as we go to sit down in the chairs, Mr. Davidson starts running toward us. "No, don't sit in them," He says, backing us away from the chairs. I look at him, confused.

"Then why did you tell us to sit in them?" I ask him. He looks at me, the smile was still on his face, but his eyes were surveying me. I observed his eyes, which were almost pale and lacking any color.

"No reason!" Mr. Davidson says into the mic, getting a laughing reaction from the crowd. I watch as Mr. Davidson kicks a chair to the floor, the chair sliding away from us. Mr. Davidson turns around to face us.

"Our next game is going to be a quick game of musical chairs! The person who is unable to sit in a chair gets eliminated!" He joyfully says. By 'eliminated,' I knew what he truly meant. "Contestants, right now, start walking around the chairs, and when I say 'Now,' try to sit down in a chair. Go!"

Pat, Tina, and I start slowly walking around the chairs, all terrified. I really didn't want either of them to die, but I also didn't want to die. I really needed to sit down in one of the chairs. Each time I walked a lap around the chairs, I was awaiting Mr. Davidson to say 'Now,' but he never did. He just kept looking at us, smiling. The vibe was no longer exciting and fun. Everything was just horrific.

After about my 4th lap around the chairs, as I was passing in front of a chair, Mr. Davidson finally shouted at us "Now!"

I quickly sat in a chair, relieved that I was in front of one at the right time. I was going to stay alive just a little bit longer. I looked to my right and saw Tina and Pat fighting for the last chair before Pat pushed Tina away and sat in the chair.

"Wait, I'm sorry, I..." Pat starts apologizing to Tina right away. I looked at him. I knew it wasn't his fault, but I didn't say anything to him.

Tina looks at Mr. Davidson, putting her hands together, pleading with him as he gets closer to her, with the same *fucking* smile across his face.

"Please don't kill me, please don't kill me, please don't kill me..." Tina quietly repeats to Mr. Davidson. Mr. Davidson tilts his head at her, almost like he was interested in what she was saying and doing. She continues walking back until she makes it to the edge of the stage, nearly falling off. She stumbles a bit, but she was able to keep her balance. My heart was in my throat, but I couldn't look away.

The crowd starts cheering and clapping as Mr. Davidson reaches his hands up to Tina's head and snaps her neck in an instant, letting her now limp and lifeless body fall off the stage, and down to the floor below.

I saw some people standing up from their chairs just clapping and cheering, and all I could do was try to scream at them, but I couldn't. I wanted to let the crowd know what was really happening, that these people were really getting killed. I looked at Pat and he was frozen in fear, and I knew he was guilty about getting the chair.

Mr. Davidson takes a long, slow turn towards us, the smile still not leaving his face. He speaks into the microphone once again. "Well, would you look at that? We're already on the final 2!" Mr. Davidson circles us, the crowd still cheering at the top of their lungs.

I hear Mr. Davidson click his tongue as he slowly circles us again. "Who will get the 100 thousand dollars?" Mr. Davidson speaks deeply into the microphone. He gets in front of us and commands us to get up from the chairs. We oblige and get up. Mr. Davidson turns to the crowd once more. "It's time for our main event! We will unveil our huge room for this finale, to determine the winner of this!"

I thought about what room he was talking about, and then I remembered. The room that was covered up when I had first walked in here.

Mr. Davidson walks towards the curtains, turning back to us, telling us to follow him. We followed him out of the stage, and down the hall, where the big room was.

I needed to get out of here. I didn't want to risk getting killed, fuck the prize money. The mystery of what this room was and what we had to do in it only scared me even more.

As we followed Mr. Davidson down the hall, I stared at the cameras that were on the wall and took a closer look at them. It... Didn't even look like they were on, let alone even broadcasting anything. I looked at another camera to confirm this, and it was also off. These cameras weren't even on or broadcasting anything. That's when it hit me like a speeding train.

This wasn't a TV Show. This was a trap.

Before I could retaliate against Mr. Davidson though, we eventually made it to the covered-up room, where one of the doors was open. Mr. Davidson grabs me and throws me through the door, down the steps, and sends me crashing to the floor. I groaned in pain and lifted my head up to check out the room. Like I thought, it was huge, with multiple borders and curved walls spread out like they were made to duck and hide behind. The room was also painted entirely black, making it hard to make out any other details.

I noticed that on the floor in front of me was a knife. Confused, I picked it up and took a look at it. It was a combat knife.

I looked farther down at the end of the room and saw on the other side, another door with a set of stairs. I figured Mr. Davidson was taking Pat to the other side to separate us, and soon enough, I saw the door open, and Mr. Davidson threw Pat down the stairs, onto the floor. I winced at the impact I heard him make. I looked at the combat knife again, wondering why we even had one.

I heard a loudspeaker from above us start to come on, and Mr. Davidson's voice rang throughout the entire room.

**"Attention contestants! The final challenge is simple. You two will have a fight to the death with the knives that I provided both of you with. The last person standing wins the 100 thousand dollars! Understand?"**

Silence on the loudspeaker for a second.

**"Good! Now the challenge starts in 3... 2... 1... Go!"** Mr. Davidson says merrily before the loudspeaker shuts off.

The thought of having to kill someone didn't sit right with me, and I wasn't gonna go through with it either. I've had enough with this stupid 'show.' I was going to get the fuck out of there.

I looked at the far end door where Pat came in from and knew that it was the closest to the back door, the door where I parked the closest too. I also didn't remember hearing the door click behind me, so I knew that Mr. Davidson probably forgot to lock both of the doors so that we wouldn't get out.

I was looking around cautiously for Pat, though, because I didn't know if he was going to actually try to attack me or not.

I started walking slowly across the room, listening closely for footsteps around me. I move behind borders around me to get across faster. I heard Pat's footsteps from behind a wall, so I quickly sat and ducked behind it, praying that he wouldn't come around. He didn't.

I got up and saw that I was halfway across from the stairs and door.

I looked around for a moment before I started sprinting towards the stairs, trying to get there as fast as I could, getting closer and closer. Before I could make it and run up the stairs to get out, I looked to my right and saw Pat running full speed at me, knife raised above his head. He looked *maniacal*, and I knew at that instant that I wasn't going to make it out of here alive.

Pat tackled me to the floor, the wind getting knocked out of me as I hit the floor, making me cough a little bit. I look up at Pat and see him on his knees over me, the knife raised above his head. I put my hands up to protect myself.

"Pat, don't do it, don't kill me, please," I plead with him. I move my hands away from my face. The knife was still raised above his head as he shook his head at me.

"I'm sorry, I have to. You know it isn't our choice," Pat says with empathy in his voice. I believed him. I knew it wasn't our choice to have to kill each other. I wasn't about to do that, though.

Before Pat could bring his knife down and stab me, I swing my fist and punch him across the face, making him tip to the ground, nearly knocked out, dropping his knife and hearing it scatter across the ground.

I got up as fast as I could and took another look at Pat, who was still on the floor, looking at me with a bruise on his face. I watch him nod at me and flash me a thumbs up.

"Good ass right hook, ow..." Pat says, hurt. I drop my knife and start to run up the stairs. I look at him again.

"I'm getting the hell out of here, I think he'll give you the money by default, don't worry," I say down to him. I turn away to the door and hear him say something, but I couldn't tell what he was saying over the sound of the loudspeaker coming back on.

**"Come on Pat, kill him! You had it there, just..."** Mr. Davidson starts speaking again, at first sounding joyful as he did nearly this whole time, but now beginning to sound angry and just outright... Evil.

**"Just kill him, Pat! KILL HIM, KILL HIM YOU SON OF A BITCH-"** The loudspeaker gets cut off as I open the door and run out of the room.

I started sprinting and I saw the back door not far from me. My freedom was just mere feet away from me, and I couldn't wait to get out of this hellhole.

I looked behind me for a second and saw Mr. Davidson running full speed after me, his smile gone from his face. His face was twitching now, but it wasn't natural at all. He was catching up to me, and he was catching up FAST.

I sprinted faster and faster, hearing his feet clanking against the floor just behind me, and I felt his hand trying to grab my shirt but he wasn't able to fully grip onto my shirt. I felt his breathing on my neck, his footsteps getting closer by the second. I got to the door and opened the door faster than I have ever opened any door and ran out into the parking lot and started sprinting even faster to my car.

I no longer felt or heard Mr. Davidson from behind me, though. I stopped my movement and looked behind me. At the back doorway was Mr. Davidson, hanging onto the door, staring at me, out of breath. There was one thing different about him, though.

His eyes, which were once lacking color, were now illuminating a bright white shade as he looked at me, his smile returning back to his face, as he stood straight up again and adjusted his suit. He waved at me as I got closer to my car and opened the driver's door. I got in and turned my car on as he continued to just wave, even as I drove away from the building, down the hill.

That's when I understood that Mr. Davidson was a human, but also just on the border of being something else. Something that wasn't quite a human being.

I did call the cops about it all but I didn't actually have any evidence to back myself up, which made me sound crazy psychopath before I remembered about the letter, but by the time I began to tell the dispatcher, they hung up on me.

I texted all my family and friends, asking them if they saw Mr. Davidson's Game Show on TV, and they said no. There was no show that was called that on.

&#x200B;

The next day there was a knock at my door at about 10 AM. At first, I was startled, but I put down my phone, got up from the couch, and opened up the front door. The mailman was at my door, with an envelope in hand.

"Are you Maddox?" The mailman asks me, looking at the envelope in his hand. I nod my head.

"Yeah, that's me. Is that for me?" I point at the envelope.

"This letter *is* indeed for you. I don't know who it's from," he hands me the envelope. I take it, at first ambivalent about it. "Have a good day!" The mailman says to me as he walks off my porch. I wave at him as I close my front door and walk into the kitchen.

I looked at the envelope, and sure enough, it said my name on the front. At first, I was confused, why would anybody send me a letter? I open it carefully and pull the letter out. I unwrap it and read it. My heart sinks when I read it.

*"Dear Maddox. You won't get off that easy. Maybe you can come onto the show again:)*

*\~ Mr. Davidson."*

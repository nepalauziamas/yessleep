I hope this is ok to post here. I know the rules say this is for horror stories, but honestly I am scared as fuck right now and just need to share what's going on. Before anyone suggests I call 911, I can hear the person that shot them. I'm in an apartment and these walls are thin. I really don't want to make it obvious I'm home. 

I'm really not sure what else to tell you other than I was just reading about this type of thing the other day. A man is gaining access to apartment buildings and randomly murdering people. Okay - now it just got really quiet. 

Fuck! I can hear him fiddling with my lock. I don't want to die, guys. Not like this. I mean, I have my hunting knife, but a blade is no match for a gun. I am royally screwed. Well, since this is likely my last post on reddit, it's been cool. I guess I'll just spend the rest of what little time I have left saying bye to people and smoking the rest of my weed.

If anyone knows how to survive a home invasion, please tell me. I am losing my shit. What the heck? Why am I freaking out like this? Oh, of course. I hit the sativa. This is not cool at all.

Ok, it seems like they stopped trying to break into my apartment.  Guess I'll just get in position to be able to stab this asshole before he can aim. People may make fun of five-inchers a lot, but when it's five inches of razor sharp steel, no one is laughing. Alright, now I'm in position.

Shit. They are fiddling with the lock again. I better make this count.


Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. I just stabbed my fiancée in the neck. Oh my god I can't believe this is happening. I called 911 already and I've wrapped the wound but I went full force.  I am trying for her to not lose blood but I can feel it. 

Please don't let this happen.  We are supposed to get married soon. We're supposed to have kids and a long life. Oh great, they're here with some cops. I'll let you know what they say.


Okay, so apparently I'm being investigated. They are waiting to see if my fiancée pulls through or not if it's murder or attempted murder. I explained what happened - that my neighbors just got shot. Cop said my neighbors are fine and something had dropped  and I had heard that.

Guys, I don't know what to do. I swear I thought someone was trying to get in the apartment to kill me. I didn't expect her back for at least anothet hour. The cops aren't even going to let me be with her. She could die and I can't even be there for her. Okay, redditors, I'm really sorry, but I have to go. The cop is telling me to give him my phone and I'm getting placed under arrest.

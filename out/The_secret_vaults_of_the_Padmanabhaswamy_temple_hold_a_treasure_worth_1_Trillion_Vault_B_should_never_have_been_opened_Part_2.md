"That's - That's impossible." Arpita said, breathless. She clutched at the wall behind her like it was the only thing anchoring her to reality.

I understood how she felt. My own heart felt like it would burst out of my chest, shredding itself to ribbons on the sharp bones of my rib cage. I bent over, rested my hands on my knees and tried to get both my heartbeat and my breath under control.

"Impossible? We just saw it happen." Mr. Nambiar said, gaping at the now empty crevice in the tree. "... Incredible."

"Should we try and find this child?" Jayesh asked, dazed. "Maybe he needs help." 

Arpita looked at him as if he'd grown another head, or popped out of a tree. "What? No... If you see someone explode out of a tree, the wise thing to do would be to run the fuck away from him. And that is exactly what we're going to do, right?"

I straightened my back, my eyes searching for the cops. One of them was on his knees, sobbing in fear, the other inspecting a section of the wall opposite to the passage we'd come from.

"We need to go back." I said. "Now."

"Sure. Let's run back up the passage. Maybe we'll even catch up to the kid." Arpita spat. "If he doesn't decide to turn around, that is."

"Do you have any other way out of this place?" I countered. She glared at me.

"How can you want to leave, Mr. Khanna?" Mr. Nambiar asked. "You know as well as I do what all this means."

I shook my head. "Sorry, but we don't have any idea what any of this means."

"Really?" He asked, looking genuinely shocked. "You know what the legend is. With what just unfolded in front of us, how can you even have any doubts?"

"I think we need to think very carefully before jumping to any conclusions." 

Jayesh turned his head towards me. "What legend is he talking about?" 

"Think about it," Mr. Nambiar continued fervently, "we might have just made the greatest discovery in the history of mankind. A definitive proof of the existence of the divine, answers to the questions of creation, to what lies beyond death, and more. So much more. All of it lies within our grasp."

"Divine?" Jayesh asked, raising his voice, "what do you mean divine?"

"Tell him." Mr. Nambiar said, his eyes gleaming. I just stared at him. A quiet descended on the clearing, one that was punctuated by the sobs of the policeman. 

Finally, Arpita gave a frustrated sigh and broke the awkward silence. "Sage Swamiyar, the one who was instrumental in construction of this temple - at least according to the legend - once prayed to Lord Vishnu, who is said to have appeared before him in the guise of a little boy. The boy defiled the idol Swamiyar used to pray to, causing the wrathful sage to chase after him. Eventually, Swamiyar found the young boy in the Ananthankadu forest and witnessed him merging into an *Iluppai* tree. The Lord did it to prove his divine nature to the remorseful Swamiyar. The tree then fell, and eventually shrank into the idol that is installed in the shrine above our heads."

Jayesh gawked at her. She muttered something about being surprised that he didn't know that.

"Are you suggesting we just met lord Vishnu?" He asked, amazed. She grimaced.

I shook my head firmly. "No. That is definitely not what happened." 

Mr. Nambiar snorted. "Come on, Mr. Khanna. Even an atheist like you has to see the truth in front of his eyes."

"My beliefs are irrelevant." I clarified. "Trust me, I would be the first person to change his mind if presented with solid evidence." 

"And you don't think the miracle we just witnessed was enough evidence?" 

"No." I said, more harshly than I intended. "I'll admit that something supernatural is afoot here. But Mr. Nambiar, you saw the look in that thing's eyes. The rage, the hatred. That was not a God. Something is clearly very wrong here, and we need to be very careful with what we do. Who knows what we might end up unleashing otherwise?"

"Unbelievable."

"Well we can't just sit around here and argue." Arpita said. 

"True, we do need to think about our next move." Jayesh added. 

She threw her hands up. "I'm not going back up that passage." 

"You are such a disappointment Mr. Khanna." Mr. Nambiar said. I could feel the disapproval coating his voice. 

"Please... I'm more than happy to let my survival instinct disappoint you."

Just then, the voice of the cop investigating the wall rang out. "Sir. I think I found something." 

A couple of moments later we were next to the cop, staring at another passageway, this one just wide enough for two people to walk abreast. Its mouth was hidden in a fold in the rock wall and it had the same suffocating darkness that nested in the passage behind our backs.

"I think we should keep moving forward." Mr. Nambiar said. "See what mysteries lie at the end of this road."

"That sounds like a terrible idea." I said. "We should leave. Back the way we'd come."

Arpita shook her head. "I disagree. We should not be chasing after the little monster." 

"What do you think we should do?" I asked. "Leaving via a path that we're at least familiar with is the smartest choice right now." 

"You would really abandon all this?"

"No, Mr. Nambiar. I'm just saying we should come back with more help." I said patiently. "Our safety should be our primary concern." 

"Nothing is going to happen, Mr. Khanna. I can assure you of that."

"And how exactly will you do that?" 

"...Do you hear that?" 

I whipped my head around. The other cop had spoken, the one who was on his knees, crying with his head in hands. He was on his feet now, head raised, bloodshot eyes gazing at the passage we had come from. I frowned. What exactly had that man heard?

And then I heard it too. Sounds that turned my blood to ice. Ringing of metal hooves on the stone floor, accompanied by the dragging of something thin and metallic on rock. The sounds grew closer. My heart jack-hammered my chest.

I felt my knees turn weak as a horse trotted out of the passage, easing out of the shadows with the grace of a trained dancer. It had a coat white as snow, and an oiled leather saddle strapped tight to its back. Tied to that saddle with a thin wire was the metallic thing that had been making that scraping noise. 

A flaming sword.

It was long and curved. Engulfed in red fire, it sent a shower of sparks dancing in the air each time it hit a bump on the uneven surface. The cop who had spotted it went down on his knees once again, shut his eyes, folded his hands and began whispering furiously under his breath.

The horse whickered as it approached the *Iluppai* tree, its white coat gaining an angelic glow under the light from the luminescent stones. It seemed to be heading towards the passage we had just discovered, so we all swiftly stepped out of the way. 

All of us, except Mr. Nambiar.

He decided to interrupt it.

"Do not do that." I warned him. "Let it be on its way."

"It'll be fine." He whispered. His face was slick with sweat. Matted white locks stuck to the sides of his head and his eyes shone with a mad fever.

He stepped in front of the horse, which slowed its pace. Time itself seemed to slow to a crawl as it faced off against Mr. Nambiar. And then it sped up again. Things happened so fast my head swooned just from trying to keep up with it all. My breath caught in my chest as the horse reared up, neighing so terribly that the noise scratched at my eardrums.

Then it opened its mouth, shot forward and bit off half of Mr. Nambiar's face, chewing off bones and teeth with a sickening crunch.

There was so much blood. Just spraying everywhere, like an exploding sprinkler. Some of it splashed on my clothes, on my face. It all felt so surreal, the warm wetness on my face, Mr. Nambiar's mangled jaw with his exposed tongue limp on his neck, Jayesh and the cop's feeble attempts to pull him out of harm's way, Arpita's shrill screams. It felt like I was watching it all unfold from a distant place. I could almost see my own body rooted in its spot.

The horse trotted away, its beautiful white coat now flecked with my colleague's blood. A thin, blood stained mask hung from the corner of its mouth as it chewed on a jaw bone. I watched it ease into the darkness, missing not a bit of its grace and poise, as if it hadn't just bitten a man half to death.

I finally turned my gaze back to Mr. Nambiar. He was on the floor, writhing as if in the midst of a seizure. Jayesh had taken his shirt off and was pressing it on the remnants of his mentor's face. It was pointless. The cloth was completely soaked, as if it had been dipped into a vat of blood, with more still gushing out. Mr. Nambiar coughed. Sounded like he was choking on his own blood, and teeth.

"He's still alive." Jayesh shouted. "We need to get him out of here."

That shook me out of my trance.

"Yes, yes." I said, then turned to the cop who still had his wits about him. "Help us lift him up."

The other policeman was out of it. He was still on his knees, spittle flying out of the corner of his mouth as he cried and blubbered and prayed. We tried getting him to help, to at least get up and leave with us but he refused to listen. We were left with no choice but to ignore him, rationalising the decision to ourselves by saying that we'd be back as quickly as possible.

Soon we started back up the passage. I was in the lead, Jayesh and the still sane cop holding up Mr. Nambiar's lifeless body by his limbs. Arpita brought up the rear.

The retreat was far more terrifying. We had a dying, maybe already dead man with us. We were aware of what exactly lurked in this place. And our flashlights were flickering and winking shut, one by one, until we were forced to run in complete darkness. I had never seen blackness that absolute. Going blind would have been preferable to this. The dark seemed to force its way inside me, through my mouth and nose and eyes and ears. It felt like I was slowly being robbed of all my senses. I had to slow down every once in a while and reach behind me and touch Jayesh's chest. Just to remind myself that he was still there. That I wasn't just drifting through some vast emptiness.

The journey back was so much tougher. Seemed twice as long and far more perilous. Path was more uneven, and the climb - though gradual - was taking a heavy toll on my middle aged joints. I was exhausted, breathless, in pain, terrified, and thoroughly unprepared for what happened next. We didn't know how close we were to the entrance of the vault, but knew that it was still far away. 

Huffing, I stumbled through the darkness, when a loud noise exploded to my right. It was a familiar sound, of wood being splintered. Hands grabbed at my face, small and grubby. I knew who they belonged to. I yelled and tried to swat them away, but to no avail. There was a freakish strength in those little arms. They grabbed me by my thinning hair and slammed my head into the opposite wall. I swooned, my tongue feeling loose in my mouth. I would have seen stars had I been able to see anything.

A flurry of sounds followed. Bare feet slapping the stone floor. Then screams. First a child, then a man. Might have been Jayesh, or the cop. I don't know. Couldn't tell the difference in my injured, light deprived state. Someone was dragged across the ground, more screams, then a wet pounding sound, like fists being driven through broken bones and flesh. I couldn't tell what was happening, couldn't tell how many of my companions were still alive. Or even near me. I didn't even know how many attackers there were. Seemed to be more than one.

It ended as abruptly as it began, the chaos leaving a disturbing quiet in its wake. All I could hear was my own heavy breathing.  

Finally, when it felt like I wasn't going to be knocked into unconsciousness anymore, I hoisted myself up on my feet. Strained my ears for any more noises. 

Nothing.

I was utterly alone.

Hesitantly, I whispered. "Hello... Is anyone here?" 

No response. Complete silence.

Shit. 

I knew I couldn't just stay there. I had to move, regardless of the others. But the thought of continuing all alone made my soul shiver. Unfortunately, the chance to make my own decision was taken from me.

A soft, but decidedly venomous growl drifted from the path up ahead. It was beastly, predatorial.

I didn't stick around to see what exactly had made that sound. I summoned what little strength and stamina I had left, and bolted back down the passage, towards the clearing with the *Iluppai* tree. I could hear growling and heavy footsteps thudding on the stone behind me. I just ran faster. I slipped numerous times, stumbled over a body twice. Twice. Two of my companions were dead, and it was entirely possible that neither of the corpses had been those of Mr. Nambiar.

Perhaps it was because of the fact that I was now on the descending path, that I reached the clearing faster than I had expected. More horror awaited me in the silver washed clearing. The man we'd left there, the cop who had been crying, was slumped lifelessly against the tree, a gaping hole torn into his belly. Jagged bones reached across the gap, as if trying to knit the wound shut. 

I didn't stop to examine the terrible scene, for the thing chasing me was still on my heels. I jumped around the tree, found the fold in the rock and ducked into the second wood and stone hallway.

You turn on the TV and you see his smiling caring face there. Constantly there are ads for his wonder rehab facility. The glowing reviews and testimonials from former patients praise him for his care and for his caring attitude towards them. It’s like an infomercial that runs constantly. You can’t turn on a TV or go on YouTube without getting an ad for Sombra Rehab center and its philanthropic owner Constantine Sinclair.

What a load of horseshit. I looked into Sombra over the past few months and what I found out about them was that not a single patient has ever truly checked out of Sombra. I have plenty of testimonials of people checking into Sombra but I never discovered anyone who checked out. What I did find through digging into their dirt was a large number of death certificates made out from within Sombra. See Sombra isn’t just a rehab center, it also contains an in-house hospital and also mostly unknown to the general public. A morgue. Where plenty of bodies are processed, cremated, and then their death certificates are written out.

My name is Desmond Williams. I served several tours in Iraq before getting my degree in investigative journalism. And after busting several fraud companies all over New England I set my sight on Sombra Rehab Center and their ‘generous’ owner Constantine Sinclair. At the start of my investigation, I was goddamned shocked to figure out that not a single person had ever checked out of Sombra. And that was enough for it to get my undivided attention. Much to my editor Grace’s dismay. She doesn’t get a say though, seeing as she has a conflict of interest, having donated to Sombra in the past.

My best bet to find something fishy with Sombra was to follow the money trail. They had just had a big renovation after an unexplained fire broke out in the facility. I remembered the first day of the fire it was claimed that a patient had done this. But in the following days, no mention of that patient was ever made. Any time I brought this fact up to a police officer I was talking to they would always claim that they either knew nothing about it or to talk to someone in higher command. So that lead was dead before it was even birthed.

But that trail led further into the money trail. After all, you can’t rebuild a place that big without a lot of money. Instead of purely looking into the rehab center itself I also turned my attention toward the owner himself. Sinclair is everywhere promoting his rehab center. You can see him at fundraisers, schools, nursing homes, and anywhere there is a social gathering you can find him there. But one thing about him you won’t find is any mention of how old he is or where he came from. Odd question to ask but plenty of us remember seeing Sinclair back in the 80s during the crack epidemic looking exactly as he does nowadays.

Now unless he’s got a great fucking plastic surgeon I don’t buy the fact that he claims to be somewhere in his forties or late thirties. Now, circling back to the money trail. Where does he get his money from? Where does he get that much money to fund everything? Easy enough explanation to say that he’s a pretty boy rich kid trust fund asshole. But I’ve checked his family history. There ain’t no mention of a father or mother passing away and leaving him all the money. In fact, there isn’t anything on him at all. No mention of him making business deals, nothing. Simply put. The man technically doesn’t exist. So where does the money come from? Where does Sinclair come from? And where the fuck do the patients come in?

So with far too many questions than answers, I decided the only way to figure something out was to go undercover. I had to get myself admitted into Sombra. Grace was far from excited.

“The hell you are!” She shouted at me when I told her that I planned to go to Sombra and get myself checked in. I rolled my eyes knowing full well my mind was already made up. But Grace was hellbent on giving me an earful on how bad an idea this was. “You aren’t even an addict! You don’t think that they’re gonna find it a little suspicious that you’re checking in without being addicted to anything?” She asked me, bringing up a fair point that I had also thought about before.

“I’m going in for alcoholism,” I told her, waving my metal flask around at her. “You always said I drink too much. Might as well get that worked on, huh?” I teased, taking one last good swig of my flask and tossing it at her. “A little memento to remember me when I get killed at Sombra.” I half-jokingly told her.

“No way in hell I am letting your black ass go to Sombra just to smear their good name.” Grace huffed, tossing the flask back at me and hitting me in the back as I turned to continue packing. “You ever think that the reason that they don’t have release forms is that they are confidential? Y’know that whole doctor-patient confidentiality shit?” She told me, stepping out in front and swiping away my car keys as I was just about to reach for them. Groaning I went to reach for them, only for Grace to stretch her arm out further from me.

“Grace, I need to do this. This shit just isn’t adding up to me.” I told her as I finally snatched my keys back from her. We stared at each other for a good long while before she just sighed and nodded. We’re both hot-headed and steadfast in never backing down from our opinions. It’s what makes us such good partners I think. I should really get around to putting that ring on her finger.

She drove me to Sombra and just laying eyes on the building gave me an uneasy sense of dread as we pulled up to the entrance. Looking over at Grace I nudged her with my shoulder and gave her the most reassuring smile I could muster and that got a chuckle out of her. Shaking her head she gave me a loving punch on the arm and sent me on my way. Walking up the steps to Sombra I turned back and waved goodbye at her as I entered the rehab center.

“Can I help you?” A soft voice asked me as I walked up to the desk in the entrance lobby. Smiling at the woman at the front desk, I sat my small carry-on bag down on the floor by my legs.

“I’d like to check in please.” It almost felt like I was checking into a hotel with how fancy and casual this whole place was. While it had a feeling of clean sanitization of a hospital it also really felt like a fancy hotel or sauna. The nurse stared at me for a second before beaming and nodding quickly.

“Of course sir! And might I add I’m very proud of you for choosing to get some help.” The nurse was so cheerful and excited that even though I wasn’t really an addict, something about the way she was so excited for me genuinely made me happy and excited to start my regiment. “Just a moment, I’ll get the head nurse to check you in.” She stood up quickly and walked over to the door behind her, typing a code on the door and slipping into the back.

I had accounted for the fact I wouldn’t be allowed to keep my phone and other items, I had picked up a little pocket-sized recorder that I could keep in my palm during the times I was searched for any items that might be considered contraband. I took the small item out of my bag and quickly slipped it into my pockets and proceeded to wait while the nurse went to go grab her boss. And soon enough she came back through the door with a new nurse with her.

“Hello, sir. Might I have your name and other basic information? And of course your choice of narcotic. Once that’s all done I can book you a room and start your treatment right away.” The new nurse was one that radiated a strange aura to me. While the receptionist nurse was one who seemed excited and happy to see me, I couldn’t even begin to understand what was going on in this nurse’s head.

“Well,” I started off, thinking in my head to make sure I got all the details right. “My name is Desmond Williams. 36. Black, obviously.” I laughed at my own dumb joke and was a little invigorated when both nurses joined in. “I served in the army. A couple of tours in Iraq. Started abusing alcohol once I got back.” Which wasn’t wrong necessarily. Coming back from Iraq had been extremely difficult. And while alcohol helped with the PTSD sometimes when it got really bad, I was never one to abuse it in any way.

“You poor thing.” The head nurse said with sincerity. The other nurse nodded with her. She smiled back at me and offered her hand to me. “Where are my manners? I’m Nurse Emily. Head nurse and the one who will usually be handing out your treatments.” I nodded at her introduction. She definitely looked like she would be named Emily.

“I’ve got you booked in room 908.” The receptionist nurse spoke up, pulling my attention over to her and nodding. I didn’t exactly know if that was good or bad so I just decided to go with it. Picking up my bag and turning my recorder on in my pocket I followed after Nurse Emily as she led me away to my new accommodations. Finally arriving at room 908 after what seemed like an eternity I stepped inside and took stock of my new living quarters.

It was simple. A twin-sized bed, a dresser, a side table, and a chair and table for sitting and doing work or whatever it was that you do in rehab. I also had a window with bars on it, which gave me my first warning sign. I hadn’t noticed any room with them when we were driving over to Sombra. Turning my head to Emily she followed my gaze and offered me a wave and a chuckle.

“A simple precaution, Mr. Williams. Withdrawal symptoms will make you do wild things sometimes.” Walking over to the window she showed me that I was still able to open the windows and enjoy the nice fresh air. Nodding at that I went about unpacking, but Emily walked over to me and looked over as I did so. “Making sure you didn’t sneak in anything illegal. You wouldn't believe what people try and sneak into here.

“Yeah? What’s the craziest thing you’ve seen?” I asked her, making small talk and also hoping she would spill the beans on the cause of the fire that had consumed a portion of the building. She tapped her chin in thought in an almost exaggerated manner before making herself giggle with her memory.

“One time someone snuck in a dildo.” She said getting a genuine snort out of me to hear her say dildo so nonchalantly. We shared a laugh at that and I went about my unpacking as she watched over me. I handed her my cellphone when she asked for it. She put it in a ziplock bag and wrote my name on it.

“So, I heard there was a fire here last year,” I said, as smoothly as I could. She looked over at me with a quizzical look before nodding.

“Yea, it was a whole mess. My predecessor was so badly burned she died in the hospital a couple of days later.” She shook her head and sighed. “Never did find the cause of it I’m afraid.” I nodded at that, but in my head, I was letting out an annoyed groan. This was gonna be hard to get to the bottom of.

“You have any theories? I heard it was a patient here.” I was hoping that she wouldn’t get suspicious of my insistent questions. It looked like she was when I brought that up, but she simply shrugged and handed me some hospital clothes and socks from a nurse who arrived with a cart full of them.

“I heard that yes. Also heard it was bad wiring, arsonists, and lighting. Really every cause in the book.” She handed me a couple more clothes and I traded in my own for them. She handed them off to the other nurse before grabbing a checklist and starting to scribble on it. “When was the last time you had a drink, Mr. Williams?” She asked me.

“About an hour ago. Wanted one last swig, y’know?” I told her. She nodded in understanding and quickly scribbled something down on her list. “Will that cause any issues?” I asked her, expecting to get dressed down for doing so. But instead, she shook her head and offered me a smile.

“It just means your detox will take longer. I’ll be prescribing you pills to aid you in the process. Just in case it becomes too much for you to handle.” She scribbled some more things down on her clipboard and handed it over to the cart nurse who nodded and pushed the cart along down the hallway.

“Great. Anything else?” I asked as I took my shirt off and started to put on my rehab-issued clothes. She seemed to think for a moment before shaking her head with a smile.

“That should be everything! For now, just get some rest and enjoy your stay here. You’re free to walk around and meet your fellow patients. Mr. Sinclair will also be around later today if you’d like to meet him. He has a special soft spot for fellow veterans.” She said with a wave, leaving me just before I could ask her one last question. Sitting in my new bed I turned off the recorder and stripped down to my boxers as I switched pants.

Fellow veterans? Nothing in my research had ever said that Sinclair was a veteran. Taking out a notebook and using the pen I had kept from signing into the center I quickly scribbled down the few notes I did have so far. Mainly Sinclair and the fact that I hadn't even been given a drug test yet to see if I was on anything else. Finishing up with that I stood up and left my room to go explore my new living space.

The hallways continued with their strange blend of both hospital and hotel rooms. Not to mention the whole place was built like a giant maze with plenty of rooms to hold patients and I’m not ashamed to admit that I got lost a bunch of times. Only really finding my way thanks to signs and to maps conveniently placed on the walls.

I arrived at the recreational center to see that several other patients were there. They all appeared to be out of it. Some of them just stood around and stumbled around in a daze. It seemed like they were all hooked on heroin or something. Walking over to one patient who was trying and failing to put a puzzle together I waved my hand in front of his eyes and got no sort of response from him. He was in a trance and seemed to be functioning on only muscle memory.

“Hey, quit bugging him.” Came a female voice from behind me. Turning to see I saw that it was another nurse that was behind me. Her arms were crossed and she looked like she was already fed up with whatever it was that had already happened to her again. I held my hands up and stepped away from the comatose man. “You must be new. Considering you’re still conscience enough to understand me.”

“Yeah, I just arrived this morning,” I told her, to which she looked at me like I had my hand caught in the cookie jar or something. “Is there some kind of problem, ma’am?” I asked her and she looked back at me with hellfire in her eyes. I’ve never seen a white woman that angry, except if her name was Karen.

“Yeah, I have a problem. You shouldn’t have come here. This place is fucking cursed, and you just signed your own death warrant.” She hissed at me, keeping her voice down and quickly walking away from me with the quickest fast walk I’ve ever seen in my life. Left completely confused I wondered if she was just being racist or had something more hiding beneath the surface. I followed after her as she left the rec room.

“Wait. Hold up!” I whisper shouted at her, grabbing her by the arm and getting a smack across the face from her for it. “Okay, sorry. I deserve that. Look, I’m a journalist.” I told her, looking around and pulling out my recorder. Her brow raised and she quickly looked around the hallway before yanking me into a nearby room.

“Are you for real?” She asked me. I nodded and told her my name. She pulled out her phone and did a quick Google of my name and sure enough my story was confirmed. She looked me over before sighing hard and noticing that the room was occupied by another patient. Lucky for both of us he also seemed out of it. “Fine, Mr. Williams,”

“Desmond is fine,” I told her, to which she waved her hand at me and looked at the patient again, pulling me close and whispering into my ear and the recorder I still had in my hand.

“Sinclair turns the people here into cattle for him. He then feeds them to this demon that pretends to be his shadow or is his shadow.” She told me. I stared at her and seriously wondered if she belonged here as a patient instead of a nurse. Again though so pulled out her phone and pulled up a video on her phone.

The video showed a wheelchair-bound patient being wheeled before a man in a suit and an umbrella. Anyone who has seen Sinclair knows that he carries an umbrella everywhere he goes and uses it outside constantly. So in my mind, it was obvious that it was Sinclair. It was clear to me that this nurse was filming from behind a corner as the events transpired.

“This one is primed and ready for you, sir.” The familiar friendly voice of Nurse Emily came from the speakers of this nurse’s phone. Sinclair nodded with his back to the camera before turning to examine the patient in the wheelchair. It was proven now to be him with his golden blonde hair and his hazel eyes.

“Thank you, Emily. You’re free to go.” He waved her off, getting a lovely bow from Emily as she walked away from the pair. Sinclair looked down at this patient before turning to his side and waving away something that apparently only he could see. Suddenly the patient was lifted up from the wheelchair like it was nothing. Before suddenly a large chunk of his face disappeared in a loud crunching sound. Sinclair stepped away from the gory affair as more and more pieces of the patient vanished.

“You can’t see it in the video.” This nurse told me as the video suddenly cut off as the last few pieces of the patient were seemingly chewed and swallowed away. “But in person, you could see it plain as day.” She quickly turned her phone off and shoved it into her pocket. “A fucking shadow that’s always around him. And he does that to his ‘patients’.” She spat, looking at me and waiting for me to respond.

“Jesus.” Was all I could muster. What I had just seen looked like a horror movie and I had just seen a live recording of it. “That’s why no one ever checks out of here,” I mumbled and the nurse quickly nodded.

“It’s in your best interest not to take the medication that Nurse Emily will give you. They’ll just turn you into one of those lifeless husks.” She told me, looking around before grabbing my palm and writing something down on it. “If you manage to get out of here, contact me. I have a shit ton of more things to tell you.” With that, she clicked her pen closed, shoved it into her pocket, and walked away from me.

Completely caught off guard I looked down at my palm to see the girl’s email address and her name. Riley. I made a mental note about that and quickly clicked my recorder off and headed off towards my room. But before I could get there I was intercepted by Nurse Emily.

“Oh! Just the man I was looking for!” She said with a smile, holding up a bottle of pills and some water in one of those cone-shaped cups. “You won’t mind if I watch you right? Just gotta make sure you actually take them.” She chuckled and I nodded with a smile, secretly wanting to strangle her right then and there.

“Not a problem,” I said, taking some pills in my hand and throwing them back. I had no intention of actually swallowing them. I held them under my tongue and took some water with them. With some difficulty moving them around in my mouth I managed to hide them under my tongue, showing them off to her and getting a thumbs up from her.

“Wonderful! Oh, and I have even more good news! Mr. Sinclair would like to see you personally in his office!” I gulped and nearly swallowed the pills. Lifting up the cone cup to drink some more water and secretly spit the pills into it. Crushing it before nodding to her.

“Sure. Take me to see him.”

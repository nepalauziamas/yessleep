Hello guys I'm gonna be honest. I do not no where to turn and I'm very scared and very tired. I live in a very major city in Florida and some very strange things have been happening to me as of late. It all started a few years back, but has begun to get a lot worse as of late. I was on a city bus on another city and two kids where looking at me very hard. More so than I could just shrug off.

 I got off the bus and they followed me and immediately took out their phones and starting talking to someone. That in itself I can just shrug off as just a weird day. Let's fast forward to a few months later. I'm traveling on a Greyhound bus to upstate Florida and a man and a woman on the bus behind me I can over hear them saying.... Yea that's him.... and Make sure you don't hit the driver. As soon as we got to our first rest stop. I get the hell out of there and catch a ride with some friends. 

Things where quiet for awhile and everything seemed normal, but lately weird shit has been happening to me. Whenever I go into the city. The homeless people all start acting strange and they start to get really excited when they see me. I have heard them say things like. Yea that's him. Or things like. Yea thats the guy. Or It's him. I was at the restaurant Freddy's and two street looking guys come in and as soon as one looks at me he hurrys back to his friend and starts saying... I could only pick up... That's the dude .... And they are gonna fuck him up... 

Everywhere I go strangers give me that same look. And some hurry up and get on their phone. This is exhausting. I was sitting at the city Library the other day and one middle aged guy with a back pack. I over hear on the phone saying.. It's my mark, but all these damn cameras... A few days later I'm at a grocery store and two guys together sit down next to me a few feet away and one tells the other.... I got a shot... The other guy tells the first no... Obvious leave fast. I'm seriously at my wits end.

 It seems everywhere I go. People notice who the hell I am and they want to do me harm. I'm exhausted and scared and tired of this shit. I do not know where to go. Or who to turn to. The police just act like I'm crazy. What proof could I show them anyway? I just don't know what to do guys. Where can I go? Who will help me? 

Does anyone know how you can find out if there is indeed a contract out on you or and also by who? I honestly do not know what I expect from submitting this post, but any honest advice or help would be appreciated.

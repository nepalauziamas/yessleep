I woke up in a hospital bed confused why I was there. I looked around, there was no presence of anyone. I went outside the room and walked along the hallway, then I heard someone talk. “Doc, patient in room A-307 needs you.” a girl with a thin voice said panickingly. I frowned not knowing where it came from, no person was in the hallway. The hospital speakers called in for someone "Calling in for Doctor Japperson to room A-296. Doctor Japperson to A-296." The door near the elevator suddenly sounded open. It was room A-296, but how did it sound like that? I swear no one was there.

I went outside to hear empty cars move, engines starting, and more chit-chattering. I walkedpast a few streets, still, there was still no one, not even a street dog, or a homeless person, butthere were food chains, malls, and everything sounded normal, it’s just that there weren't any people making that sound. I went to a Chinese restaurant downtown, I could hear the fire being lit, the sizzling of the beef,and the sound of pans hitting the stove. I could also hear chair scratches and people having conversations as if they were just near me. The only thing is, the restaurant was empty. Eventhe lights were off, and there were no signs of any workers, but I heard them. I hear everyone.

Night time had come, but I felt no desire to rest. The noise i everywhere, getting louder andlouder nonstop. I hadn’t eaten all day but my stomach wasn’t also asking for food. I later
noticed I had no bodily functions. No pain, no adrenaline, unlimited stamina, not even hurtwhen I accidentally harm myself, it left no mark either.

I went to my old house, where my wife and daughter were before I was here. “Mommy, whathappened to daddy?” my little girl said, “Well, baby…,” my wife started to speak with acracking voice, “Mommy, couldn’t protect daddy very well.” she said, trying to speak whilestopping her sobs. “That’s why, Daddy went to a long sleep in the hospital. I bet Daddy wasreally scared, and Mommy couldn’t be there for him.” she forced a smile, “I bet Daddy’s reallymad at Mommy, hm?” I was taken aback, “No, no! It wasn’t your fault!” I screamed in the air,but they couldn’t hear me. “Baby, Daddy’s just stuck, okay? I’ll be back for you, okay?” I saidloudly trying to make them hear, but I couldn’t see them, nor could they see or hear me.

It’s been three years. The noises won’t stop, and I’m going crazy. I can’t bear it anymore. Icould’ve seen my daughter grow up. I could've explained to them what happened. Oh, boy,trust me, it’s worse here. Not being able to be heard, to see, nor see another human being.

There’s something I forgot to write here. Before waking up, I’ve had enough of the worldbecause of non-stop people coming in my way, always wanting to talk, squeezing me, pushing me, and I couldn’t take it anymore. So, I decided to jump off a building, next thing I knew, I washere. It’s worse here. No matter how much I tried to end my life again just like how I ended it first, I can’t escape from here.

I don’t know how long, what I need to do, or what it takes for
everything to just go back the way they were. No, for everything to just end. I don’t know whereyou might find this letter of mine, but I’ll warn you, it’s worse here. If you can help me in any way, just please, please, help me.

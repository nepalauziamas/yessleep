I was always a believer in the paranormal. Ever since I was a boy, I was taught about the existence of the otherworld and I never questioned it. Growing up, I've had several rather strange encounters which have only exacerbated my belief. After all, this world and the other one were never too different for me. 

I have heard the ghost in the middle of the night in the hospital fiddling with the manual weight scale, I have a photo of myself taken in another hospital with a ghostly face by my side. I have seen a young man wearing only his small clothes walking his dog in the freezing minus twenty degrees. Maybe this is why the next experience didn't shake me, why I believed it was important. Why she kept following me.

That day, All Hallows day of 2021., I have been at the cemetery with my family. It was a tradition, we would always visit the graves of our relatives that day. Just as many times before, we have walked between these graves, inhaling the scent of falling leaves and burning wax. It was, finally, the time to leave. As I walked out, close to me yet not too much I've heard the grunt of an old lady.

"Ooohh..."

It sounded pained, a moaning croak, and I could nearly, in my mind, see the old lady with eyeglasses in her seventies, suffering for whatever she may have commited in her lifetime. I have not questioned this; I was never too judgemental. 

I have thought it a prank, so I left the graveyard and the day went on rather peacefully. Later that evening I was driving my bike to the evening mass. As I left my home village, I had to pass by another graveyard. I passed there many times and it wasn't strange nor haunted in any sense.

Just as I've passed the graveyard I've heard the familiar sound.

"Ooohh..." 

Now the chills ran down my spine. I've decided to put my trust in God, believing I will be protected if the worst comes to pass. After saying one prayer for the souls of the departed, I've felt peace washing over me. It was over. Whatever she suffered from was done, and there was nothing else I could do. Little did I know, she would appear one more time.

This time, I was at the concert. It was a beautiful event, with many Christian performers coming from all parts of my country. Just as the smoke was rising in the air, confetti blowing around me, priest started offering a prayer of guidance. At that very moment, I've felt a strange pressure in my head. Right there and then, I've seen a face in my mind, twisted in pain.

 It was an old, female face wearing glasses. "She still did not depart." I thought as I offered her spirit joined in the prayer. The pressure in my head was immediately relieved and I haven't seen her again ever since.

For now.

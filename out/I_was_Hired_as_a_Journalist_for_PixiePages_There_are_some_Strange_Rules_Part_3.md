For the first time, I didn't die today!

I woke up feeling worse than any hangover from my college days. My throat, dry and sandpapery, left me nearly voiceless. It seems that I wasn't fully recovered from the day prior.

Wasting no time trying to run, I blinked. In a flash, I was sitting beside the lineup of coworkers, 8:56am on my dash. Strangely, a gym bag lay on the passenger seat, a note tied to the strap.

The note read 'pick up any offerings. Do not consume them. Follow the rules.' In addition, a series of addresses were scrawled like a grocery list, numbered with checkboxes and everything.

"What's this?" I slapped the paper on Jo's desk, a look of bewilderment on both of our faces.

After a couple seconds of scanning over it, Jo snorted. "Grocery list. You know what to do, errand boy. You got a bag to fill, no?" She spoke so damn condescendingly, as though explaining addition to a five year old. I was inclined to flip her off, but chose peace. I took the sheet back, then turned and walked back to my car.

Gravel crackled as my wheels rolled over the poorly maintained road. The unpaved path had a 'dead end' sign, half buried under spray painted graffiti. 

"Your destination is straight ahead." Maps stated, confirming my location.

The neighborhood was pretty homely. Bright, lively grass filled the yards. Well maintained houses lined the street with uniform space between them. Some even had the stereotypical white picket fence. 

The unnerving part, well one of them, was the fact this neighborhood existed. I had driven through dark alleys, rundown husks of abandoned brick buildings, and at least two burnt down lots. Yet in the heart of the ruins, here I was, cruising through an immaculate community. The stark and abrupt transition from was like oil and water. A clear line was drawn in the sand, where nothingness became something.

The coldesaque rounded off with a colonial style graveyard. It was almost as though the property was cut straight from an exhibit from colonial times. In the center of the graveyard, atop a hill of dead grass, a modern, two story log cabin sat. The dirt path that led to it seemed rarely used, though not overgrown.

I pulled up to the black, pointy fence and parked my car. I pushed through the front gate, which creaked on rusted hinges. My hair stood on end as I strode along the winding dirt path. I kept scanning for an arm or a leg to jump out and snag me, all the way until I made it to the front porch.

I held my breath as each step groaned in protest under my weight, and as each plank nearly buckled as I approach the front door. Before I had the chance to knock, the door slid open. A wrinkled old face wore a three toothed smile, as the ancient woman croaked out a welcome.

"Deary me, a guest?"

"No ma'am, I am with the PixiePages." I stated, feeling uneasy. The lady looked like a bonafide witch.

"Pity, I prepared so many sweets from the children." The witch spoke with a deathly chill.

"I could take some off your handsss-uhm?" I fought back from gagging, seeing thirteen fingers wrapped around the door. Thirteen fingers drummed the door. The second from the top had five fully articulating joints. One went the wrong direction.

"That would be lovely!" The witch cheered, clapping with unseen hands. The fingers continued drumming on the door.

The decrepit woman slinked back into her home. I swear I could hear multiple muffled cries, as though screaming through a mouth gag. At least five voices wailed from beneath the house, from what had to be a basement.

Seconds ticked by. Then minutes. The fingers remained on the door, drumming slower than they had been. Suddenly, they drummed much more rapidly, then clenched into a fist so tight, the wooden door splintered.

The door swung open fully, the wicked woman grinning more hideously than anything I'd ever seen. I instinctively took a step back, nearly slipping down the steps.

"Herey deary!" The witch spoke with glee, hurling a glass tray of alien casserole straight into my chest. Somehow staying intact, I managed to catch the dish. This left my hands occupied, unable to catch the railing.

I fell backwards, protecting the food as I slammed into the dirt. The witch cackled from her home, then cackled some more. She kept on cackling as the door inched itself shut.

The whole time I retreated to my car, the witch's cackling echoed in my ears. Thank god the moment I crossed the threshold, escaping the haunted property, the laughter ceased.

I placed the foil covered casserole in my back seat, then buckled it in as best I could. Through the glass, I swear I could see an eyeball pressed against the glass. It wasn't just suspended, either. It was… vibrating… it kept creating bubbles in the swamp like slop… I shuddered, but ultimately decided to get back on the road.

Two hours later, I arrived at my next destination. 

The school was set behind in the center of the suburbs, though it was quarantined by yellow police tape. Red stains lined the otherwise unremarkable building, as though coated with a massive smoothie.

Luckily, I was not forced to go inside. Instead, a familiar suited man stood, a bald child violently sobbing at his side.

Sean tapped the girl on the shoulder, then pointed to me. The girl sniffled, wiped her face, then wiped again with a tissue Sean produced from his… sleeve? I dunno man, Sean is full of surprises.

Together, the two dragged a tank mounted machine to my trunk. Sean then walked back, disappearing into the building, reappearing ten or so minutes later with a waste basket.

"This is Cassie. Would you please see her to her home? She has had a rough day, and you owe me for getting you this." Sean ordered, shoving the bin in my face. The liquid contents inside sloshed around, chunks squelching as they hit the walls. The rancid stench of bile filled my nostrils and stung my eyes, daring me to vomit.

"Don't complain, and I'll give you an air freshener." Sean proposed, raising one eyebrow as a challenge.

I steeled myself, clenching my fists to calm myself. Needless to say, I had Pine Tree combating the putrid odor that sat on the floor in my back seat. The bald girl was nearly catatonic as we drove. She silently got out from my car, then trudged up her driveway, collapsing through the front door as soon as it opened.

Seconds later, Sean pulled up behind me, speeding to the girl's aide and talking to her horrified parents. I wanted to do something to help, I really did. But I hadn't the slightest clue how, and my phone rang.

"Jossssh" Jo hissed. "Get back on the road!" She ordered, promptly hanging up.

I bit my lip, contemplating what to do. With a heavy heart, I put the car in gear and continued on.

When I returned to the office, I popped the trunk. The tank thing burst out, landing on its side with a heavy clang! In a robotic, constant tone, it droned the word "help. Help. Help."

A few unfamiliar people exited the front doors, flipping the tank upright. I patiently watched, unsure of what to do.

"Where?" Jo spat, having snuck up behind me.

I nearly jumped out of my skin, turning to face her. "What?"

"The materials. Where are they?"

"Materia-uh back seat?" I shrugged, confused by her choice of words.

In response, Jo pointed to my rear seat. Two men and a woman retrieved the fowl items from where they sat, all recoiling at the tear jerking stench.

One man and the woman carried the bin inside, each using one hand to cover their nose. The other man carried the maccabe casserole inside. The three disappeared without another word.

"You can call it for the day." Jo stated, bitterly.

Not willing to risk losing the opportunity, I said nothing. I went inside, punched out, and returned home. Thankfully, the odor vanished as soon as I entered my car.

I regret leaving those people with the witch. I regret doing nothing for that little girl. Tonight was time to drink.

So here I am, drinking my problems away. I can barely make out my keyboard through my swirling vision. If anyone can advise me how to help them, I'm open to ideas. I still can't bring myself to speak this out loud. It's almost like my tongue isn't mine anymore.

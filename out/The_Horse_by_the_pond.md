When I was a child, my gran told me “if you ever see a beautiful white horse near a body of water, run”. That’s exactly what I did when I was hiking in the woods near my house when I saw the most beautiful white horse drinking from the small pond off the path. She was tall and muscular with a long white mane. When she noticed me, I’d swear she was calling to me

“Brenadan. Brendan. Brendan. Brendan” in a really angelic voice

The urge to approach the creature was strong but then I remembered what my gran said all those years ago so I ran. I knew the quickest way out of the woods so I ran towards that direction, but to my shock, I was back at the pond

“What the…that’s not possible” I thought

The white horse was still at the lake

“Brendan. Brendan. Brendan. Brendan”

I tried to leave the woods again but ended up back at that pond. I tried again and again and again with no luck. Every time I saw the horse, she kept repeating my name. Each time I saw her, the urge to approach her got stronger.

“What’s the worst that can happen I thought” so I slowly approached the horse

She looked up at me and as I reached out my hand she lowered her head towards my hand but just as I thought “you’re friendly”

She grabbed my hand with her mouth and dragged me into the lake holding me under with her strong legs

I struggled and struggled and struggled, gasping for air as I tried to escape. Then I heard what sounded like a bang and the horse ran away.

I got out from the water and started breathing heavily

“Are you alright?” Said the voice of a man

I turned around and standing there with a hunting rifle was an elderly old man with a long grey beard

“What, what was that?” I asked

“A kelpie. Dangerous creatures they are”

“So that’s what they’re called. My gran warned me when I was a child to run if I see a white horse near a body of water”

“She’s a clever woman. This particular one has been around for centuries. We call her “Capall Diabhal”

“Demon Horse?”

“Correct”

“I tried to run, many times but I kept coming back to this pond”

“Her power has grown. Before we could run, it looks like now the only way to escape her is to make her run. It looks like gun shots do the trick, for now”

“If she’s been around for so long, why haven’t I seen her before. I’ve walked this trail many times”

“Kelpies are shapeshifters. They mostly take the form of a horse, but they can change into anyone or anything they like. She’s probably been watching you for ages now, waiting for the right time to strike. Maybe as a bird, maybe as an insect, maybe even someone you’ve met on this trail before. Now, I think it’s best I get you home before she returns”

The elderly man drove me to my home. After that day, I got a gun licence and a rifle and kept it with me at all times in case she finds me. I haven’t walked that trail since and I warn anyone who plans to walk it to stay away for their own safety.

It happened 5 months ago, I was outside with my kids. I was sitting in my chair as my kids were playing next to the pool. My son was 5 and my daughter was 4, neither one could swim so I had to be near them when they were outside to make sure they didn't go in. 

I heard my phone start ringing and wanted to go get it but didn't want to leave my kids alone out here. I thought it wouldn't be too long and decided to grab my phone. So I went in and grabbed my phone and saw it was my mom calling, so I picked up and asked what she wanted.

She went on about how my uncle was going on again about how the government was putting trackers in his pills and she needed me to talk to him. I told her I would talk to him later and said my goodbyes before I hung up. My husband came in asking who called and I replied to my mother telling him everything my mom said.

He laughed because we all knew my uncle was weird, he then asked where the kids were and I then remembered they were outside. I rushed out there to make sure they were alright. I froze when I got out there, both of them were in the pool not moving so I jumped in to get them but by the time I got them and pulled them out it was too late.  

I tried but nothing they were long gone, my husband called 911 and the paramedics showed up. They took my kids away as I cried and my husband stood there not saying a word. At the funeral, my family comforted me but my husband was outback getting drunk, after the kid's death he started drinking instead of speaking to a therapist.

Our marriage eventually fell apart and we soon got divorced. After my kid's death and the divorcement, I had to go to therapy which was helping. My ex-husband went missing and his family couldn't find him or reach out to him.

His brother acted a little strange when asked if he knew his whereabouts saying he had no clue. I just hoped he was safe and getting the help he needed with his alcohol addiction. I wanted to blame myself for everything that happened because if I hadn't gone inside to get my phone they would still be alive, and my husband would still be with me and not missing.

It's been 5 months now since their death and I'm trying to move on and get my life back in order. I've been taking pills my therapist said I should take, which have been helping me out. But I have had a weird feeling though like someone is watching me but I brushed it off as nothing. One night though I was getting ready to go to bed, I took my pills and got in my bed, and right before I turned the light off I heard something.

It was my son's voice calling out to me "Mommy I-'m scared, please let me in" I froze in terror because it couldn't be was I imagining it, I had to be he was dead. I then heard my daughter calling out to me "Mommy!" I cried hearing their voices.

I went downstairs quietly and looked out the window and there they were at the front door, but their faces there was something strange about their faces. I backed up quietly making sure they didn't hear me, but I then heard their voices again. "We know you in their Mommy!" I wanted to scream because whatever this was it wasn't my kids.

They started banging on my door and I yelled at them saying they weren't my kids and if they didn't leave me alone I would grab my gun. I then heard a man's voice "You don't own a gun" it was my husband's voice. "Rick is that you" it went silent for a while until I heard his voice again "You know what you did now you're getting what you deserve".

I then heard muttering on the other side and then I heard laughter. I was confused until I heard my husband's voice again "I just remembered I still have keys to the house". I froze in terror and ran to the kitchen and grabbed a kitchen knife, yelling at my husband to stay out. 

I heard the door open and heard both of them coming in, I was shaking in terror knowing I might kill my ex-husband tonight. Both of them came in wearing the kid's faces, I wanted to vomit seeing it. Both of them then pulled the faces off revealing my ex-husband's face and his brother that was acting weird whenever we questioned him, my ex-husband. 

"What, I can't get a welcome home honey from my old wife" I held the knife up in self-defense "Oh is that a way to treat your family" I backed away slowly still holding the knife up. "You know what you did you can't run from the past. If you had been watching them they would still be here" I told him to stay back as he got closer"Come on honey let's not fight in front of the kids" as he held up my son's face.

I went to stab my husband but he grabbed my hand laughing menacingly, he then slapped me across the face making me drop the knife. Then they both held me down and forced both my kid's faces in my mouth, I wanted to puke as my ex-husband demanded I eat them. I finally threw up but my husband forced the kid's faces down into my throat.

They both through me to the ground and started kicking me as they laughed, I eventually blacked out from it. I woke up in a hospital bed not knowing how I got there and 2 police officers were there. They told me that my neighbors heard me scream and called the police to make sure I was alright. And when they got there they saw me blacked out and brushed up on the floor with 2 faces next to me.

I told the police everything that had happened and they told me they would keep an eye out for both of them. But they could never find them and I eventually moved out and back in with my mom, I could never feel safe knowing my husband was still out there.

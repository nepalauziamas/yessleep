I just needed quick money, now I’m stuck here forever. Each day that goes by I end up digging a deeper hole for myself. Each command becomes more, & more drastic. I’ve made it to the point of no return.

 My thoughts are interrupted as My partner says “Hello? Are you going to fucking help or not?”
I reply “Sorry my bad, i’m just thinking a lot right now.” My partner replies “C'mon man we don’t pay you to think, we gotta get this done by the end of the day.” I stay silent. 

Infront of me, there stood a man seated on his knees with a look of complete defeat & sadness written across his face. my partner has a handful of this man’s hair in one hand, and the other is a machete.

“Are you recording?” my partner says, as i hold my phone up. I just feel an extreme sense of dread, anxiety, & nausea all at once. All negative emotions that are possible, I feel right now. I’m so helpless as I come to the realization that this is now my life. I’m stuck here forever. I replied “Yes.. i’m ready.”  “Tell me when to go.” he says.

I take the deepest breath of my life as I say “1. 2. 3. GO.” 
He starts the video off by saying:

“Ladies & gentlemen, here we have a police affiliated rat, who attempted to double cross us, by giving information about our members to the police. This is what happens when you fuck with CJNG.”

I feel a full on panic attack come over me as I try to remain calm. He proceeds to then put the machete to his neck and slice with all his might. what seems like gallons of blood pour onto my partner’s machete wielding hand. I see in graphic detail every ligament, every vein, every artery being torn as my partner attempts to slice completely through his victims neck. Blood flows in a continuous stream down his mouth & freshly sliced neck. As he got to the last chops, the victim’s head was met with resistance. I watch in horror as I see my partner struggling with fully decapitating his head. The last chop was the most horrendous. The snap I heard as the depcaption was complete will forever play in a loop in my head. 

I can’t help but retch as I try to keep my vomit in.
My partner proudly holds his victim’s head in the air as he proclaims loudly: “THIS COULD BE YOU!” I end the video with a shaky finger as I take those last words in.

“Let me see.” he says as puts his bloodied hands on his hips. he watches it as he says “This is great man, send the video over to my number so I can forward it to the bossman.” I stay silent as I go into a thought inducing trance.

I’ve officially seen it all. This was the last nail on the coffin. God will never forgive me for what I have done.

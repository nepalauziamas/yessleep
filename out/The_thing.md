I can remember the day clearly and what happened on that day.

It was 2012 and I was only a 10 year old 

My mother was a druggie but she always made sure we had a roof on my heads and made sure she fed me but one time when she was on whatever drugs she got her hands on she did something stupid and somehow got into trouble with the police.

“We’ll go on the run like Bonnie and Clyde” is what she told me before we packed all our stuff up (which wasn’t a lot of stuff) in suitcases and headed down the road to get her friends who were also drug addicts and alcoholics like her.

We had been on the run sleeping in the back of our car deep in the forest and other places where we knew our car wouldn’t be found and by the second week my mother and her friends ran out of beer and drugs and I ran out of snacks so we had to go rob a store which is something I still feel incredibly guilty about.

A couple weeks after that the police found all of us so we hopped into our car and sped down the road until we lost them then I told my mom something I had been trying to tell her for weeks until this.

“Mom?”

“What?”

“Please stop the car”

“Why?”

“Because if…if you let me out here I can go to grandmas I know where her house is”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“Mom I really don’t wanna spend my teens running from the cops or in prison so please just stop the car and I’ll get out and walk to grandmas”

She then stopped the car and I got out then grabbed my light blue suitcase waved her goodbye and they sped off since I was only a 10 year old I sat on the ground and sobbed for a good 6 minutes then I stood up and walked to my grandma Jane’s house. 

“Grandma I just had to walk away from my own mom because…because she’s on the run from the police and I don’t wanna be associated with that”

She hugged me tightly while I cried 

“I know and I’m sorry”

“Can I please stay with you?” 

“Yes of course! Just don’t make any messes and if you do please clean them up you know how I am about that” 

“I understand grandma I won’t be any trouble I just wanna take a shower and go to bed”

I walked into her house took a shower and went to bed in her spare bedroom.

A couple weeks after that I was having a sleepover with my friends just watching Disney movies and such until one of my friends who we’ll call Leo said he wanted some candy from the dollar store that was right down the street from my grandmas house.

So he got his shoes and money and went out the door then my other friend who we’ll call Joy wanted some candy too.

So she ran after him but not even a second later she came running back inside sobbing hysterically saying “Something is out there!” “There is something out there!” But we thought she was joking and we started laughing until we realized she was actually sobbing.

So me and my friend violet looked out all of the windows but we couldn’t see anything so we went outside to look some more and still we couldn’t find or see anything until I started hearing something like gurgling 

So I looked behind me and saw a big black blob that was slouched over to the right with a horn sticking out shuffling towards us 

“Violet what the hell is that?!”
I asked her

“I don’t know!”
She said with fear in her voice 

We didn’t wanna see it anymore so we ran back to the house where Joy was still sobbing while sitting on the couch

“Oh my god where is Leo?!”
Said violet 

“Oh god I don’t know!”
I said 

Just then Leo came through the door 

“Leo!” “Are you okay?”
I asked him 

But he said nothing and went back to the room and went to bed

I’m now in my 20s and I haven’t seen my mom since that night I just hope she’s getting the proper help she needs

And I will forever wonder what I saw that night

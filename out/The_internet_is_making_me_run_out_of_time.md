A r/NoSurf oriented story 

My parents wake me up for school. I do not remember when I fell asleep.

Let me check my phone. I do not have time to eat breakfast or get dressed. An hour has passed already and I'm late now.

I go to school, agree with whatever the teacher says and pretend to be very normal. They think I'm a shy, studious kid who pays attention in class. Not really, my true personality is hiding in my phone, and I just want to to home. 

I go home and start surfing. I google anything. I anxiously take screenshots of whatever useless thing appears useful to me. I have 218 tabs open now, and 300+ screenshots. 

How will I close these tabs? I constantly keep switching between them. It feels like a task that I must do. First open tabs of random things, then get worried about how I will read all of them. I do this all day, listen to random songs, watch porn, scroll reddit, and at some point fall asleep.

Before falling asleep I see my average daily screentime on my iPad - 8 hours 49 minutes. Every fucking day.

It's worse on holidays. During vacations I had over 16 hours of screentime a day.

No one knows about this habit. They believe I study all day. I have insane luck. I passed my grade 10 with the highest scores in my school. I was one of the 11 out of 37 children promoted to grade 12 without failing any subject. My luck has prevented me from failing in society, so far atleast.

I don't go to family functions. I don't go out with my parents. I make no friends. The only thing between me and a perfect life, as perfect as that of a movie protagonist!, is the Internet.

But surfing the internet is important for me. How else will I gain knowledge about things? If I don't surf the web for 8 hours a day, I might miss out on some really useful information. My parents are pretty lame and never helped me in anything career related anyways.

I have so much knowledge I can hold a conversation about anything. But the only knowledge I need right now is related to my studies. Exams are coming and I might fail. I should probably study but

First let me google "How to study for highschool finals". Then search the same thing by adding reddit at the end. Then search videos on it. Ah shit, I again have 100 tabs I need to go through before I can actually begin studying. 

I fall asleep without studying anything. My mom wakes me up. I decline breakfast. What an annoying mom, she's probably trying to make me fat. I was really overweight once, the Internet helped me lose weight. Let me google how I can kill my annoying mom.

Let me check my phone. And let me check my iPad. I don't even play videogames anymore. But this urge to surf the web is even stronger than my need to eat or drink.

I put my phone aside and try to study. But I feel extreme anxiety. Let me check my phone again.

Yeah, this is why I dont do good in my exams despite being such a good student.

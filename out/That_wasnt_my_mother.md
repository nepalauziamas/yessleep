I was sitting in my living room one day playing my Nintendo wii. I was killing it in bowling when I heard my “mother” shout out my name.. I heard “hey can you come in here please” only she used my name and for privacy purposes I wont say it. I replied “hold on” as any other young teen would do in the middle of a game. 

I heard it once more again “hey can you come here” and i replied again “hold on ok mom”?… i shouted again “mom”!? Keep in mind that i was in my living room and 10 fr behind me is my parents room. My mom yelled back “what”!? But only it came from the kitchen , I asked my mom “hey did you call me and she responded with a a “no” what are you talking about.

I instantly got chills due to the temperature drop and something told me not to turn around but i did anyway. I see a women no older than 35 or so with long black hair and glossy green eyes. Here head was peaking around the corner like a child playing peek a boo.. when i looked back she gave me a smile and moved her head back on the other side of the wall..Thats not even the freaky part.. she runs away and as i hear her foot steps running away i hear her say again “come in here” but followed by a laugh that sounded like a toddlers laugh with a flemmy throat.

I ran into my moms room to see where she went but of course she was gone. Later that night i was woke. From a dead sleep in the corner of my room there she was again just looking at me with a blank expression. I asked “what do you want”? She just tilts her head in confusion and opens her mouth so wide and unleashed the same laugh i heard earlier that day. 

I stuck my head under my blanket and yelled for my parents and when my dad came in she was gone . I just told them I had a nightmare cause i didnt want to be looked at as crazy. I woke up the next morning and told them the truth. You can tell they wanted to think i was lying but it seemed like they knew something i didn’t. 

My mom asked me if i knew what a ouija board is.. I replied no i do not. She went on and told me all about it and how you can try and communicate with ghosts and what not and that they are bad due to the fact that they can open up portals and there is no telling what you can invite into your home. She said she caught my sister and her friend using one a couple days ago and my sister was telling my mom on and on about how she was antagonizing the spirits by calling them p***ys and saying “i bet you wont show yourself.

My mom believes she may have invited in a un welcomed guest. To this day that house was never the same alot of other weird and freaking stuff continued in that house until we decided to move. If you liked this story let me know and i will keep posting.

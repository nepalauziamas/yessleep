My alarm had just woken me up, telling me it was time to go. Me and my friends had organised a mountain hike to a place about 300 miles away from civilization.
So my alarm had just woken me up to remind me of it.

They were already waiting for me outside. Samuel and Brooklyn and me. We call eachother the three musketeers, as we are always up to any type of genre challenge. And this time it was mountain biking 300 miles away from the city.

We had a van that had been used for over 50 years by 35 other owners, which had soon given up on it as it would make a gunshot like sound that was distorted.
It wasn't cursed, the gears were just a bit rusty. Us three we love it, as it would make the perfect sound of a musketeer's gunshots, which seemed coincidental.

Anyway, we hopped in excitedly and sped off to the hiking trail. Samuel was always overprotective with his property, and Brooklyn was always being a jerk. But eventually, we would get along and have a blast.

"Yo guys, are you sure we should go hiking to this exact place?" Remarked Samuel. I'll call him Sam from now on.
"Yeah, what's the problem? What's the most that can happen, us getting a mosquito bite?" I answered. Brooklyn giggled, he was driving and wasn't focusing on the road and was about go off road. So I took over the wheel and steered him off and told him to focus on the road.

"This gives me chills, I read that this place was once a military hideout in 1875" replied Sam.
We had arrived and it did indeed look like an abandoned military base. There were watchtowers, hideouts, air raid bunkers and aircraft hangers. It all looked extremely old, and the fact that it was once used amused me.

"Screw it, why don't we explore this place instead?" I offered.
"Yeah, that sounds like fun!" Agreed Brooklyn.
"Alright, alright fine!" Sighed Sam.

We hadn't brought any equipment, so all we had was a stick that Brooklyn found which he used as an elderly stick and pretended to balance on it.

We continued up the mountain when, out of nowhere, came a god awful screech that I thought shaked my eyesight like it would in a video game.

The rustling of bushes can nearer and eventually a jaguar like creature took a lunge at Brooklyn and dragged him off into the bush.

I stood and watched in fear, as I heard his calls for help.
And soon his dead carcass was thrown out of the bush
And layed before us. All his organs were dug out, and I could hear the creature chewing on them. Whatever the creature's next target is, I didn't want it to be either of us, who were still frozen in fear.

So all I could say was:

"RUN!"

Sam followed my instructions and we took a run for it.
It was extremely steep, considering it was a mountain.
We were what seemed like metres away from the car.
But all of the sudden, Sam took a tumble. He was then scewered onto a giant wooden spike, which launched his blood towards the floor

This made me want to puke, but I knew there was no time for that, so I lunged at the open car door, lit the car and sped off. I was now a single musketeer, with dozens of tears running down my face which made it even harder to drive.

I am writing this as a warning.

Don't explore abandoned places without a supervisor.

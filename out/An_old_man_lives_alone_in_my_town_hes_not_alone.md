I live in a small town and in that town lives an old man. His house is up the road from mine and he lives a quiet life, not interacting with people and staying inside his home all day.

I asked my dad about him and all he told me was that his wife and son died years ago and that he just wants to be left alone. But kids in my town made up rumors about him, saying he murdered them or that his wife and son are alive and he's keeping them held captive.

But to me, it just sounded dumb. But one on one night we heard sirens and found he collapsed in his front yard, and was there until someone found him and called 911. They took him away and that was it.

The next day, my friend told me we should sneak into his house and find out his secrets. I told him I wasn't doing it and that he was an idiot, but he told me if I didn't come with him, he would tell my crush I liked her. 

I said I didn't care and I wouldn't do it, and he then said he would tell my parents that last week I through a party while they were out. I told him he wouldn't dare but he gave me a cold stare and I knew he had me.

That night, he sent me a text saying to meet him at the house in 20 minutes, so I sent him one back saying I would be there. I then left telling my parents I was going over to my friend's house. I jogged to the old man's house and when I got there I saw my friend wasn't there so I sat there and waited for him listening to my music.

Eventually, my friend showed up so I turned my music off and asked how we were going to do this. He said that we were going to try the front door and if it's locked, try a window. So we went to the front and tried and you wouldn't believe it, but it opened right up.

"Was probably never locked" my friend told me and walked into the house. I followed behind and closed the door making sure no one knew we were breaking in and called the cops. We looked around for a light switch and eventually found it and when the light turned on we were stunned.

We saw stuff laying everywhere coloring books, photos, and clothes. I looked at a photo and saw a family and when I looked closely it was the old man when he was younger. With who I assume was his wife and son.

I looked over and saw my friend wasn't there so I called out for him. He replied "Dude, I found the basement" I went over and saw his excited face. He probably has so many secrets down here but I said, I didn't have a good feeling about this. But he proceeded to turn the door handle but to our surprise, it was locked.

"Well, I guess it's locked we should probably get out of here."

But before I turned to leave I heard a slam. I turned around and saw him kicking the door "Are you going to help me?" I was nervous but helped him and we finally kicked it open. A weird smell went up my nose and I quickly covered it.

My friend ignored the smell and went down and after a while, I heard him scream so I ran down ignoring the smell. And when I found him, he was just standing still so I walked over and saw why he screamed. Lying on the ground were 2 rotten bodies with flies going all around them.

One was a woman and the other was a boy, after seeing that I ran out of there leaving my friend behind. I pulled out my phone while running and called the cops. After a while, the police and ambulance both showed up and took the bodies away. 

We found out later that the bodies belonged to his dead wife and son who both died years ago, and that the man was messed up in the head. He just couldn't let them go and dug up their dead bodies and put them in his basement. But, I couldn't get that out of my head and had to start taking pills to help me but there not working and I don't think anything will help.

I could tell [the new girl](https://redd.it/bmqi90) was going to be a problem right away.

She waltzed into the open house on Daffodil Lane wearing some obscene fluttery pink top like it was a perfectly normal thing to do. 

She didn’t even notice the scorch marks on the driveway.

I bit my lip until it bled. My wife used to berate me for the fidgeting.

In a lot of ways, it was easy being single again. 

I suppose it’s a good thing that pink top girl didn’t notice the scorch marks. It means we cleaned up well. 

And such eyesores are *strictly* against Pelican Peak HOA rules.

I sat alone in my room, watching the black and white video monitors. 

The Willard house was quiet (finally), and was so devoid of movement that it could have been a still photo.

Wind gently swayed through the Magnolias on the corner of Daisy Lane and Garden Street. A bin full of food scraps sat prominently by the curb.

There was a sallow-skinned man that I knew to be 6 feet, 3.32 inches who was standing outside the Murphy house. His face was pressed against the window. Through the grainy footage, I could barely discern his tongue methodically licking the glass. 

The Murphys couldn’t tell, of course. Their curtains were drawn.

Everyone assumes they’re safe when their curtains are drawn.

I sighed in relief.

Just another normal night. 

I was about to check the footage from the other streets when something caught my eye.

Oh, shit.

The Gray Man had stopped eating garbage. He was staring at the nearest home.

*Fuck.* It was the new girl. I *knew* she was going to be trouble.

I looked wildly around the living room and settled on a nine-iron. It was going to have to do.

Heart pounding, lungs burning, I sprinted toward rapidly-brewing disaster.

My breath was beyond catching and I could barely see when I got to her house. There he was, pounding angrily on the door. If the fool inside had half a brain, she would be hiding in the darkest closet right now.

“Stop!” I screamed before realizing that I *had no plan.*

Slowly, the Gray Man turned to face me.

The empty black sockets were big enough to hold baseballs. Light from the half moon was just strong enough to illuminate the farthest recesses of his hollow skull.

He dropped his jaw.

It kept falling until it was two feet below his face.

No matter how many of the damn things I see on the video monitors, I *always* get icy chills when I see them in real life.

He groaned. Then he started walking toward me.

I pointed the nine-iron at him in self-defense, but knew it was like taking an umbrella into a hurricane. 

*AAAAAAAOOOOOUGHHH!*

And then he charged.

I didn’t even have time to turn around before something far away caused the ground to shake.

The Gray Man stopped in place.

“Oh, fuck,” I whispered. “Listen to me *very* carefully.”

The Gray Man looked at me in soulless attention. I prayed that he understood my words.

“You need to be very, very, *very* quiet,” I continued in the softest tone I could muster, “And I’ll get you all the chicken bones you like. How’s that sound?”

The rumbling had stopped, thank God. Now I had to keep it that way. 

The Gray Man stared emptily back at me.

And then he screamed. 

*Why* did it sound like a dying woman’s last shriek? That made everything so much creepier than it had to be. 

And the ground shook. 

It didn’t stop shaking.

The Gray Man understood. He turned and ran at an inhuman speed. When he caught up to me, he didn’t attack. 

He was too afraid.

As the shaking continued, not a single house light turned on, and not a single window opened. 

Which meant that *everyone* understood the danger. 

So I knew that no one would let me inside, no matter how much I screamed and begged. The first tears fell then, and I wondered if I could kill myself with a nine-iron. 

It would hurt less than being found outside after dark. 

A flash of inspiration came over me, and I acted without thinking. 

CRACK

The nine-iron hit the Gray Man squarely in the kneecap with a sickening burst as I shattered his bones.

*AAAAAAAOOOOOUGHHHAAAAGGGHHH!* He screamed as he fell to the floor. The ground shook more violently still as he disrupted the night with his wails. 

Then a roar ripped the sky apart. It was loud enough to reverberate from anywhere and everywhere all at once.

But I knew it was radiating from the cul-de-sac at the end of Petunia Lane. 

I knew that its source would be here in a matter of seconds.

And I knew that the Gray Man couldn’t run anymore. He would lie helplessly on the asphalt as his screams drew *it.* 

Which meant that I would have just enough time to sprint home, close the curtains, and spend night ignoring the knocking that would come from every window and every door.

*

It’s not the sounds that got to me most.

Sure, I hated hearing the Gray Man scream in pain that I had caused. And I hated it even more when the screams abruptly stopped. 

I could hear the crunching of bones from two blocks away.

No, what gets to me the most is that we *knew* this could happen, and we didn’t prevent it.

This is all the new girl’s fault. She had every opportunity to follow the rules.

And breaking the rules has consequences. I don’t like it, but there are many, many things I live with that I don’t like.

Tomorrow night, she’ll suffer the punishment she brought upon herself. 

And when she runs through the streets, screaming and knocking at every house, my neighbors will know to ignore her. 

No matter what sounds they hear, no one will open the door. 

No matter how much she begs before she dies, every child will stay quiet.

They held us on the tarmac for about half an hour on account of heavy fog. The captain made an announcement and then went silent. Outside it was still dark and the headlights from the vehicle towing the luggage struggled to penetrate the mist.

The sun was rising when we began to taxi to the runway. In the seat beside me a short woman with dark hair closed her eyes and touched a finger to her forehead and then her chest and then once to each shoulder. She lifted a pendant in the shape of a cross from her neck and kissed it. I am not religious but if there is a god then I hoped he would watch out for her and by extension me.

When we took off I pressed my head back and gripped the arm rests. I tried as best I could to hide my fear. Everyone else on the plane seemed calm. Even the woman next to me had closed her eyes and had a serene expression on her face. She could have been asleep.

I have not always had a fear of flying. I flew a few times when I was a kid without any problems. But after I left school the dreams started. I don’t dream much, but when I did it was of planes falling from the sky. I am on the ground in a strange place and look up to see the underside of a plane. Sometimes it pitches and rolls and the engine squeals as it nears the ground. Other times I see it right at the end, the final moments in the air before the plane explodes in a ball of flames. 

I explained away these recurring dreams as a manifestation of some deep seated fear. But there was the possibility that these were not just dreams. When I was a kid my dreams were different. When I started school I would wake with images in my head, like photographs. Pictures of trees or birds or kids running. The strange thing is that during the course of the day I would be in the playground or in class or on my way home and I would see the image I had in my head when I woke. A tree or a bird or a kid running and it was an exact match. 

And before anyone dismisses this as some sort of déjà vu, here’s what happened next. By the time I was in secondary school, I woke with conversations running in my head. Voices chatting away like two people talking to each other. Then later that same day I would be sitting on a bench eating a ham sandwich and overhear two people having that exact conversation. Sometimes I would even have a part, like learned lines from the school play. I would give the words as I’d heard them in my head and the response would be, to the word, exactly what had run through my head. It was as if there was some script everyone was reading from. That is not déjà vu. 

On one occasion during lunch break I listened to two of my friends have a conversation. I don’t remember now exactly what they were saying, but I do know that at some point what they were saying clicked. They replayed the words from my dream that morning. What made this day different was that I decided to intervene and change the script. A science experiment to see what would happen. I interrupted Lauren as she was about to respond to Sam. She looked at me confused. It was a rude thing to do. I brushed it aside and changed the subject to see if they would get back to the conversation from the script. They didn’t. The end of the conversation that played in my head was never spoken. I had a sudden sinking feeling in my stomach and I looked to the sky to see if somehow my actions would make the world end. But the sky stayed blue and the sun rose the next day and everyone and everything carried on. 

The one change was in my dreams. I no longer saw any images or heard any conversations. All that stopped. Now I saw planes falling from the sky. And there was one other constant. A blonde girl I didn’t know. She was always with me when the planes came. She wore one of two things, a blue mesh sweater with a white shirt beneath or a black jacket that came halfway down her thighs and black knee-high boots. But always a plane crashed.

And so I developed a fear of flying. In my adult life I avoided planes. I took holidays to destinations within driving distance. My friends went for weekend trips to Vegas and I made excuses ranging from illness to saving for a house. Anything to not step foot on a plane and turn those dreams into reality, like those pictures from the schoolyard.

Then I received an email from my boss. She wanted me in New York and the flights were already booked. It made sense. It was my client and my project. It would be strange to send anyone else. And there was an overnight stay in The Big Apple on the company dime. I was hard pressed to find an excuse to turn it down. Nothing I thought up made any sense. No logical reason would stop me from getting on that plane. It was that or quit my job. 

I was nervous before I even reached the airport. My knee bounced up and down the entire cab ride. What didn’t help is that this was soon after 9/11 and security was far stricter than I remembered. Uniformed personnel with holstered weapons did not add to my comfort.

And now here I was. Accelerating into the sky.

The plane rattled and pitched as it punched through the clouds. I felt dampness under my armpits and wiped a few drops of sweat from my brow. When we stopped the climb and the engine noise dulled, I became aware of the rapid and heavy beating of my heart. I wished for the engine noise to increase a few decibels to drown it out. 

I took the magazine from the pouch at my knees and flicked through it for the fourth time. I couldn’t concentrate on the words and closed it and wringed it into a tight cylinder. I needed a distraction. Two men behind me were deep in conversation and eavesdropping was as good a distraction as anything.

“I read something online yesterday,” said one.

“What’s that?”

“There’s this guy in Australia, some sort of psychic.”

“What are you reading that shit for?”

“Don’t go all sceptic on me. Hear me out. Anyway he had this radio show a few years ago and he made a bunch of predictions and they’re all coming true.”

“Don’t even start. They’re charlatans. They make statements vague enough like you will meet someone unexpected today and bam you run into a guy you haven’t seen for a while and suddenly they’re Nostradamus. But that shit happens all the time. It’s rubbish. You might as well go read your horoscope.”

“But that’s just it. This guy made specific predictions about specific people. He said JFK Junior would be involved in a plane crash and he said Princess Diana was going to be in an accident in Paris. And get this. He said the World Trade Centre would be attacked by air in September or October in 2001.”

“He did not.”

“He did.”

“When did he do this?”

“In 1996.”

“1996?”

“And he did it live on radio. Thousands of people heard him. He says he sees pictures in his head when he dreams and then they come true.”

“Is this legit?”

“There’s recordings. His name is Scott Russell something. What do you make of that?”

I turned to the woman next to me and tapped her on the shoulder and got up. I couldn’t listen to any more of that conversation. I locked myself in the bathroom and ran the tap and buried my face in my palms. 

What do you make of that? 

The plane jumped. I grabbed the rail. The noise that accompanies the seat belt sign sounded. The captain’s voice urged all passengers to remain in their seats and fasten their seatbelts. There was some rough air ahead. 

Jesus, just what I needed. 

I returned to my seat and fastened my seatbelt and pulled the cord tight. Not that it would do me any good. If this thing went down the seatbelt would be about as useful as sunglasses in the dark. I pressed my forehead against the seat in front. The woman next to me gave me a sideways glance. She could see I was nervous. A stewardess appeared, calm and smiling and strolling down the aisle checking everyone was complying with the captain. I shut my eyes and pictures of planes exploding into balls of fire appeared.

And then, after a bit more turbulence and a few more beads of sweat and about a million beats of my heart, we landed. Safe and sound in New York. It wouldn’t be today. Today the plane made it. I let out a sigh. 

The day passed without event. The meeting was a breeze and made a mockery of the lack of sleep it had caused. I exited the building and the adrenaline left my system and fatigue set in. I went to the hotel to change and ended up in the bar on the ground floor. I couldn’t muster the energy to do much else.

I watched the street and the mood of the people seemed subdued. It was a city coping with tragedy. A shock no one saw coming. Except one person who saw something in a dream and went on the radio and shared it with thousands of listeners. I drained my beer and went to my room. I wasn’t in the mood for anything else.

I rose early. I had a restless night. I dreamed of the blonde girl. This time she wore the blue mesh sweater with the white top underneath. The dream jolted me awake and was vivid enough that for a moment I was surprised the girl wasn’t in my room. It was still hours before I had to be at the airport for the flight back. I decided to take a walk by the water.

A cold breeze blew in across the bay. The sun hung low in the sky. An elderly woman walked her small dog down the road. The dog tipped up one leg at a bench and sprayed. 

A blonde girl came in the other direction. She looked familiar and I tried to place her features, but came up blank. And there was no one in New York that I knew. I looked away and my brain continued to tick over and the penny dropped. Without looking back I formed a clear mental image of what she wore. A thick blue mesh sweater with a white undershirt. 

“Holy shit,” I said. 

I looked up and the girl had stopped. It was as if she recognized me. We stood silent and unmoving. Then a noise from the sky. Out of the blue came a white shape. The underside of a plane. It was not unexpected, we were close to the airport, but I was struck with a feeling of unease. I had seen this before.

The underside of the plane grew larger and the noise rose to a near-deafening scream. Something was wrong. The plane pitched down when it should be climbing. The airport was close, but not that close. 

I lifted my hands to my ears as the undercarriage passed close overhead. It felt for a moment as if it would crash at my feet. I swivelled my head and followed it, willing the pilot to arrest the dive. The plane continued to fall. And then it hit the ground and exploded into a ball of fire. 

Snapshots of various dreams coalesced into a single and continuous reel of deja vu. Everything I had seen came to pass. The different planes I saw crashing were in fact this one. I saw snapshots in time at various points of the event. First the plane high in the sky. Then the plane overhead, almost close enough to touch. Then it hung just above the horizon. Then the ball of fire.

I felt sick. I had to sit. My legs trembled and gave way. I stumbled to the bench and collapsed and put my head in my hands. I hoped to wake in my bed and have this be yet another dream of a plane falling from the sky. But the cold morning air and the hard bench refused to yield. 

I removed my hands and the blonde girl stood before me. Her eyes were wide and glazed with tears waiting to be blinked away. 

“I saw you,” she said. “I saw you in my dreams. I know this sounds crazy. I can’t believe it’s you. Sometimes in a brown jacket, sometimes in an orange shirt. And always a plane crashes.”

It took my breath away. I stared at her dumbly for a moment. I looked down at my brown jacket. 

“I’ve seen you too. Sometimes in a blue sweater and sometimes in a black jacket and boots. And always a plane crashes.”

She blinked and the tears rolled down her cheeks. She shook her head and skipped away almost running. I didn’t go after her. I sat and watched the thick plume of black smoke rise into the sky.

I missed my flight. Honestly there was no way I was getting on a plane after that. I rang my boss and he agreed to charge a hire car to the company and I drove home. To this day I’ve never flown again.

I never talk about this. Not with anyone. If your colleague or a friend or your partner came to you and told you this story, would you believe them? Or would you call them crazy? 

I know I’m not the only one. There is the blonde girl. There is the psychic on the radio. But when I hear others talk about their dreams it’s never like this. I don’t want to be that person, the odd one. The freak. So I keep it to myself. 

Until now. 

I still dream of her. The blonde girl. There’s no more blue sweater, only the black jacket and boots. And this time when she is in my dreams I see a spray of fire erupting from the ground and smoke spilling into the sky. And then everything goes black. 

She said she sometimes saw me in an orange shirt. My closet has always been free of orange shirts. I even avoid yellow and red to be safe. I figure I can cheat the system by refusing to own one, like when I changed the conversation in the school yard. I hope she doesn’t own any black jackets or knee high boots.

I have two younger brothers, twins. One is getting married next month. The other is the best man and has arranged a weekend away for the bachelor party. He is keeping the details close to his chest as to the destination. I don’t even know. 

Yesterday he came to my house carrying a big cardboard box. He dumped it on the kitchen table and pulled out an orange shirt and held it up.

“What do you think?” he said.

He’s had shirts printed for the weekend. They are all orange.

“What’s the matter?”

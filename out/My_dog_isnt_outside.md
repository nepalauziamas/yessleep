This happened right after I finished college, a few of my friends and I had thrown a graduation party at my house and one of them happened to crash at my place. Around 4:30 in the morning, everyone had gone home except said friend, and I was getting ready for bed.

I heard scratching at my backdoor, I had assumed that one of my friends had let my dog out before they left, so I went to let him in. While I was heading to the door, my friend had woken up. She had asked what I was doing, I had told her the situation and she just looked at me with a look of confusion and concern. (I've been known to hear and see things that other people can't, but it's gone down in the past few years.) She said that she was on my bed with my dog, and the dog had started growling, which isn't normal, he's very placid. My mind then went to the conclusion that I was hearing things again. "Didn't you hear the scratching on the door?" I asked her, hoping that I wasn't going crazy. She nodded. "It's probably just some animal at the backdoor, go to bed." She told me. I wasn't quite convinced, so I had quickly flipped up the window blinds to check.

That wasn't a fucking animal.

That was a person. I quickly flipped them down, hoping that whoever was out there hadn't seen me. I looked back at my friend, who looked confused. I mouthed that there was someone out there. She ran to my bedroom to get her phone and dial 911, I stupidly just sat by the backdoor, frozen in fear. She called the police, and she told me that they would take about 10 minutes to get there. I just sat and listened to the person outside, waiting to find out if they would make a move.

They did.

They started trying to pick my lock, which was very shitty as is, and I had times struggling to get it unlocked and locked. I shifted over to my door and held the door nob, in case they did manage to get it unlocked. This continued for a few minutes, then they gave up and moved to my window. This TERRIFIED me, as my window had no locks. I swiftly moved to hold the window down, silently pleading to whoever was in charge of the universe to have mercy on my soul. Thank stars they felt generous.

The cops pulled up and arrested the individual who was trying to break in. As it turns out, it was someone on parole, who had a history of theft, and multiple charges of assault. They had a hand gun, matches, a lock picking set, and a backpack. I'm thankful the police showed up on time, because the contents suggested they were planning something much more than stealing a few things.  
Every now and then, the thought pops up in my head,

What if they got in?

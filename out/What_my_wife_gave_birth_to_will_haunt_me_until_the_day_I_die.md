In the eighth month of her pregnancy, my wife suffered a complication that required emergency surgery. When she woke up and I told her the surgery had been successful, her reaction was nothing short of terrifying.

She didn't seem happy, didn't utter any words of relief, she just slowly reached down to her belly; her eyes widened for a moment, and then she began to laugh. 

It was a deep, humorless cackle that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I had to repress a shudder as I asked her what was wrong, but she ignored me.

Instead of answering she began to scream; her whole body shaking as she thrashed and wailed; tearing out tufts of her hair and throwing them on the ground. I kept asking her what was wrong but she wouldn't answer. 

All of a sudden she went completely silent.  She raised one hand up high. She paused for a moment--our eyes locked--and she brought her hand down with all her strength, plunging her long fingernails into her stomach. She tore at her stomach with such fevered ferocity that I was sure she would rip it open. 

I grabbed hold of her wrists and with great effort I managed to wrestle them down next to her sides. I had to use the restraints on the rails of the bed; once I did her whole body suddenly went limp, as if she was too weak to move.

I sat down beside her bed; I could hear my voice shaking as I tried desperately to calm her down.

"It's alright, honey. It was just a small complication after all. Soon we'll have a beautiful baby boy. Our son. It'll all be worth it then."

She slowly turned her head towards me. Her eyes were dead, devoid of humanity. She began whispering, her head lolling limply around on her shoulders. I leaned in close to hear what she was saying. It was just one sentence, repeated over and over.

*Get it out of me.*

She refused to speak at all for the next week; sometimes she would just lay there, totally limp and motionless.  Other times she would scream and pull at her restraints until her wrists bled. I tried calming her down, telling her that this was a good thing; bringing her baby clothes and her favorite foods, but nothing I did could reach her. Finally, after a week, she went into contractions.

As soon as the baby came out, it was clear that something had gone horribly wrong. The stench was unbearable; a sick, nauseatingly sweet smell-- but the baby was worse. Its head was overly large, its eyes bulging and bloodshot, and the skin was black and ragged; sloughing off in my hands when I touched it.

It was a miracle that my wife survived the birth.  I tell myself that we're lucky for that, even if our son was born dead.  She seems to be relieved that the pregnancy is over, but I just keep going over everything horrible that's happened in my head. It tore my heart out when she gave birth to our third stillborn son, and it was even worse when I had to force-feed her those pills so that I could perform the surgery to put him back inside of her. 

If we're going to hold our marriage together through this tragedy we'll both need something to look forward to. I think I'll go tell her I'm ready to try again; maybe it will cheer her up.

When I say drugs are fantastic, I'm not talking about the designer substances you find in a dark ally. No, I mean the amazing medications invented to cure anything from infections to psychological disorders. 


The only problem is the excessive restriction on legal drugs. The amount of research, work and potential that gets lost with each denial from the FDA. Just because something doesn't work exactly as intended, it doesn't make it useless. 


I say this as a person who's always had trouble sleeping. Not in the sense that I can't fall asleep, but rather that I need a whole eleven hours just to feel barely rested; A fact that absolutely does not fly in my line of work. 


After trying conventional drugs that were aimed at people with narcolepsy, none that proved to be an adequate solution, I had no choice but to turn to the illegal side of things.


Think about all the drugs never to reach the shelves at your local pharmacy due to failing to get FDA approval, it's not like their recipes and research just get thrown out. No, there's a whole market for them buried in the depths of the dark web, available for anyone that knows where to look. 


Of course, it has its risk, and isn't something I'd recommend for your average Joe. I, however, was desperate.


Months passed, and I tried numerous different substances, some which helped a little, while others just made it worse. In the end, I landed on a product simply called: Nox.



Using a P.O box, the medication arrived within a week. To my surprise, rather than finding a bottle filled with colorful pills, I just received the one, wrapped in a high quality, expensive looking package. 


Based on the forum I found it on, no one had experienced any adverse effects, so I stupidly ingested it with little hesitation, impatiently awaiting its results. 


On any given day, I'd be tired around eleven, but with the pill making its way through my digestive tract, I realized that midnight had come and gone, leaving me wide awake.


Morning came, and yet I didn't need any sleep.


It was great, I got all the work done at a record pace and still had plenty of leftover leisure time. It caused some jealousy at the office, but considering my competitive nature, it didn't bother me in the slightest. 


Days turned to weeks, then weeks turned to months, and I had successfully eluded the need to sleep. By all logical aspects of biology, my brain should have deteriorated, driving me to the brink of madness, but even a year after ingesting the pill, I remained as sharp as ever.


The only thing I noticed was my skin seeming thinner, paler as if I'd fallen slightly ill. 


I initially fell suspicious of the pill, but my tired looking facade could just as easily be explained by excessive amount of work. It wasn't as if I could stop taking the pills anyway, seeing as I'd only taken the one. 


That's when I noticed the first “sore.”


It looked like an ulcer, a bedsore, but it was situated on my stomach just below the navel. It didn't hurt or anything, so I just put some cream on and waited, but it kept growing. 


During the next week, patches of skin started falling off, revealing the fat and muscle beneath. It didn't particularly hurt, but it was growing day by day, and it horrified me. 


I quickly tried to find the site I'd purchased it from, but in the ocean of hidden onions that is the dark web, it had simply vanished, and the link had expired. As far as I could tell, no one, not even the FDA, had ever heard about a pill called: Nox.


Over the next few weeks my physical state deteriorated, and the doctors were baffled, yet I remained completely lucid. Even sedation for procedures had no effect on me. 


Eventually, after months of my skin sloughing off, my heart just stopped... Yet, I couldn't fall unconscious. 


As I type this, my body is rotting away, and I'm gradually losing function of my arms and legs, and my vision is fading. The only thing remaining is my mind, as wide awake as ever. 


Once I'm done here, I'm putting a bullet in my brain, but I'm worried that even then, I'll have some sliver of consciousness to keep me awake as they put me in the ground, [where I'll lay in darkness forever.](https://www.facebook.com/richard.saxon.author)

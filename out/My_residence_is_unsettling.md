I woke up hot and sweaty as i kicked the covers off of my body. The clock read 1:52 am , and i needed to pee badly . I was very tired because the previous night i was up late playing video games. That blueberry soda i had just before bed was pretty tasty , but i drank too much. I got up and made my way downstairs to use the bathroom. On my way back up stairs i made sure all the lights were off , and headed back to my room to go back to sleep. As i laid my head on my pillow and started to drift back off to sleep , i felt movement my bed . Still half asleep i moaned " uh unn " . I heard a voice say " I have to pee , I'll be back " . I mumbled " ok " and continued sleeping . Only four to five seconds went past before i jolted myself awake terrified . I darted across the pitch black room frantically reaching for the light switch . When i turned on the light no one was in my room . I checked the closet and it was empty. I know someone was just in my room ! I check the entire house and found nothing , no sign of a break in or anything . At this point i assumed i just was having a bad dream, but i had to be sure. 


I went down stairs checking the bathroom as i pulled back the curtains to the shower and to my surprise their was nothing there . I chuckled a bit as i turned off the lights to the bathroom and headed back upstairs . It must have been a bad dream , silly me . The clock showed 2:14 am and i really needed to get my rest . I turned off my light and headed to bed . After some time had past , i felt the right side of my bed sink in as if someone was lying right next to me. This time my eyes opened and i was wide awake. I was terrified because i knew someone was on my bed. As i laid there still too afraid to move, i could feel the bed sinking deeper behind me. I was laying on my left side and what ever was in my bed was to my back .I told myself just don't move and everything will be ok. I could feel the sweat from the heat running down my face and on to my pillow . What happened next sent me into a panic ! In a deep low toned voice something whispered in my ear " IM BACK ! " . 


Without turning on the light or even thinking straight for that matter , I haul ass out of my room as fast as i could ! Sprinting down the hall i grabbed my keys barefoot and hopped in my car . I floored it without even locking my doors to my house . Should i call the police ? No! i checked the house dammit ! No one was there when i looked and i know i searched the entire house . I decided to stop at a gas station for a late night snack to help calm my nerves . On the way back to my car i forgot that i hadn't locked my doors to my house so i decided to head back . I know it was stupid as someone could have been inside my house , but i just kept telling myself that i was being paranoid . I waked into my house and locked my doors i checked the entire house once more and saw no one . I was too scared to sleep in my room so i decided to sleep in the living room with all the lights on. I managed to get to sleep that night , or morning you could say .

I'd woken up around 11:00am to the sunrise and felt sticky from all the sweat . I need a shower ... i smell like onions . I ran some water but then realized i needed to go buy more soap because I ran out . Great... now im musty and have to leave to go buy soap funky . Regardless i needed to shower because i smelled . traffic was a bit bad and the trip took a bit longer than usual . A roughly 20 minute drive took me about an hour and 45 minutes due to an accident . The temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit and the heat wasn't helping . God i wish i could just get back so i can shower and eat ! . I made it back to the house around 1:30pm and decided to get straight in the shower . I grabbed my change of clothes and headed to the bathroom laying them on the sink while i ran water . I was so hungry at this point i forgot that i left the soap in mini mart bag . I left to grab the soap from the shopping bag which was on my bed in my room . Upon returning to the bathroom just as i got to the hallway i froze . What i saw shocked me to the core ! 


I saw myself with a bar of soap walking into my bathroom and shut the door . My heart started racing ! What the fuck is going on ? I knocked on the door and said " who ever is in there I'm going to call the police " . Just as i said that the water stopped running and in a low deep voice i heard something say " I'll be out soon " . The voice was extremely deep and loud. I slowly backed away from the bathroom door , and went to grab my gun from the safe . I kick in the door violently and no one was there . I know that nobody came out of the bathroom , but what i saw go in looked like me . I heard something speak ... something not human . I felt like i was going to shit myself . I checked the house once more and saw absolutely no one . I once again lied to myself and said that i was hallucinating from a lack of sleep . I was still very shaken up by what ever the hell i just witnessed . I took the gun with me in the bathroom just in case and showered quickly . That was the fastest shower I'd ever took in my life .

After finally eating some food that i shockingly somehow managed to stomach after witnessing what i saw , the door bell rang . I looked outside and it was four Jehovah's witnesses . Three of them were wearing a black dress and hat and one of them was wearing a blue dress with a dark blue hat and gloves . As i opened the door i politely told them that i don't practice that religion and i wasn't interested . They simply told me " bless you sweetie " and left . I shut the door and decided to watch a movie . By the time the movie was over i had just enough time to watch another movie before i needed to get to sleep . Staying up late was ruining my sleep schedule , and i needed to get it back on track . As long as i was in bed by 10:00pm i knew I'd be well rested . The next movie was 3 hours long and i had just enough time to watch it when i heard a loud knock at the door . I thought to myself who would be visiting at this hour ? 

I looked out side the peep hole and turned on the porch light from the switch on the wall . It was one of the Jehovah's witness ladies from earlier . Why would they come to people's houses at this time ? This was extremely odd as i told them i didn't practice their religion and i wasn't interested . The lady who was standing on my porch was the one with the dark blue hat , dress, and gloves . I opened the door and said can i help you ? Her hat covered her eyes and she said nothing . I started to get crept out and asked the lady if she was lost . Still she said nothing and just stood there . I tried to say lady but before i could finish the word her head quickly rose up and i saw cold grey eyes like that of a snake . She had no pupils , just grey eyes with a large crooked grin . Her head twisted around all the way around and the back of her head revealed another face and it was my face .
She let out a long hiss sound followed by a moan that sounded like someone dying slowly . That deep voice from earlier came back and said " ALWAYS WATCHING " . Just then the head contorted back around as i was frozen with fear . I tried to run but i couldn't . My body felt as stiff as a statue and i was terrified . The lady's face began to melt like wax as her skin hit the porch . You could hear the scream of a woman in agony but as if she was gurgling on liquid while dying . My front door violently shut on its own and i literally shit myself .

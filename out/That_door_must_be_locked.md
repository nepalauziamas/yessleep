This morning was as usual as it could be I never really noticed my bf acting weird not until I came back from work. I work in a hospital as a nurse. Before I left work  I noticed some of my coworkers where smiling there lips seem odd there lips stretched from one end of the cheek to another. 

Their eyes where starring at a door behind that door was a patient who had come in a week ago not a lot of people know what happened only the ER nurses but they won’t say anything. 

I remember the next day after the patient came I was walking past the break room and hearing two of ER nurse talking. I recognized both their voices cause they where good friends of mine.  

Amanda said “ Her eyes t-they where horrible” 

Roses said “Something is wrong with her she keeps smiling” 


Amanda turned looked around and lowered her voice like if she didn’t want anyone else to hear luckily I was close enough to hear “she came in all dirty and bleeding no one knows where she came from” 

Rose in a lower voice said “ they say she was on the road in a puddle of blood smiling” 

shivers went down my spine when the thought of it came to me. I snapped out of the thought and saw that the two nurses where still smiling I shrugged it off and walk out. 

When I came home my bf was on the couch smiling and staring at the tv. I said his name and he looked at me differently his eyes where darker than this morning his hair looked dirty and his smile his smile looked odd just like the nurses smile. 

I snapped my fingers and said “ Are you okay?” Your freaking me out” 

my hand started shaking. I dropped my keys and grabbed my phone. He turned around and stood up he walked to the hall which the lights where off and then it hit me the smell  that weird smell made me feel of running out but I needed to know what was wrong with my bf. 

Then out of nowhere my bf turned around and started sprinting towards me. I freaked out and the first thought that came to me was stab him with the keys when he comes close to me I grabbed the keys as hard as I could and stabbed him right in the stomach he dropped to the floor and screeched it was not a normal scream it was a mix of a animal screaming and a human screaming 

I dropped the keys and ran out of the house. I called 911 once I came out onto the road. Once the police came in to investigate they saw a trail of blood go to the back yard and into the forest. When I came back to work a week later I noticed that the same smell from that night came from the room. I walked up to the room but someone stoped me Amanda said “That door must be locked” before smiling that creepy smile.

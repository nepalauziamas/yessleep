This story happened a few years ago and I’m just now in a state of mind to share it. The aftermath of these events have ruined my mental health greatly, and I hope that you can understand what I am still going through. I will be telling this story from the information that I have been given from my wife because I, unfortunately, was not there to help my wife and son during this encounter.

To begin with, this happened back in September of 2018 at our house in a small neighborhood in Tennessee. The temperatures were cool enough that my wife, Andrea (38), and son, Marcus (15), had decided to take a walk down to a small pond and park just a few blocks away from our house. This was completely normal behavior for them as they both lived a very active lifestyle, and the neighborhood was extremely safe especially during the day. I (42) was at work a few hours away. 

Now, as I am told by my neighbor at the time, Andrea and Marcus encountered a stranger on their walk. He was not from the neighborhood, but he knew Marcus’s name for some reason anyway. 

Andrea, who is a very observant and borderline paranoid person, probably instantly suspected something odd about this man, but she did not instantly run away or go get help since she was a very polite person. She was not the type to instantly jump to conclusions. 

Now this man introduced himself to Marcus and Andrea as “Nero.” He seemed like a nice enough guy, but he soon started to reveal many very concerning signs. The first sign to appear was his insistence to talk to Marcus alone. This was the moment when Andrea probably realized something was extremely wrong, and this man most likely wanted to harm either her or Marcus. 

Obviously, Andria rejected this request and pulled Marcus back towards our home with a strong grip and a brisk walk. This wasn’t the most thought out decision from Andrea, but I do not hold it against her since I wasn’t there to feel the pressure and fear she must have been feeling. As imaginable, Nero did not take his rejection with kindness and followed them while trying to engage Marcus into conversation. Andrea did not allow Marcus to turn around or stop though.

When they reached our house, Andrea told Marcus to go open the garage door and go inside and hide while she confronted Nero. Marcus probably recognized the fear from his mother and followed her orders without question. 

Andrea then distracted Nero before making a run for the house herself and closing the garage door in his face. This wasn’t quick enough. Nero quickly moved forward and managed his way into the garage before the door had completely closed. Andrea ran into the door and straight to the back bedroom of our house where we kept hidden our .12 gauge shotgun. 

Marcus was hiding in a dark spot behind a recliner in the living room. He was a short distance from the back door in case he was found by the intruder. He had enough of a view from behind the chair that he could see the entrance to the hallway that his mother had just ran down. A few seconds later, Marcus could see Nero silently sneaking over to the doorway to the hallway. He then stopped to wait just out of the line-of-sight from the hallway. He was positioned so that he was directly in front of Marcus’s hiding spot. Any slight movement or sound from Marcus might be seen or heard by the unwelcome intruder.

At this moment, Andrea was walking up the hallway, shotgun loaded, completely unaware of Nero waiting for her. 

Marcus watched in horror from the corner as Nero swung out and grabbed the barrel of the gun when she reached his location. On reflex, she pulled the trigger which was mere inches from Nero’s chest.

The earsplitting explosion as the gun went off echoed off the walls, completely obscuring Marcus’s screams as he felt warm blood splatter onto his visible forehead. Mixed with the blood, he could feel sharp stabs from something sharp that could only be bone fragments. The body of Nero dropped to the floor in a pile of his own shredded skin and escaping organs. 

Marcus was still screaming when his hearing returned minutes later. This gave away his position, and his mother ran over to hug him. He could feel her tears dripping onto his body and her body shaking against his. 

This is not the ending though. Unfortunately, the events after this initial encounter get much worse. I wish I had been there. Maybe the outcome would be different and maybe everything would be normal and OK today. But now, all I can do is tell the story as I know it.

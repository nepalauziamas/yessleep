I live with my mom and dad in Louisinana, America. We live in a countryside house, with cows, pigs and almost everything a farm has, we live far from the city and had one neighbor,  we usually visit his house on holidays for family gathering, as we see him as what he is, a family. John lives all alone, his mother died 5 years ago because of blood cancer, he has no other relatives who lives with him, no wife, no children, all he has is a pig farm. 

John left a note for us 3 days ago saying he'll be back after 2 days, he hasn't been back yet made us feel suspicious but we thought he had some urgent businesses, his house's door was locked, so are the windows, they got curtain covered every single windows. But we didn't cared much for it and we do our daily routine.

One day, we were having a family gathering at our house, the only person missing was John, I finished my plate and went to wash 'em. Then, I saw a figure outside of the kitchen's window. I squint my eyes, trying to clarify if it was a shadow or a tree. It still stands there, so I asked my mom if she saws that, she said no. I find that strange and just continued to do the dishes. 

Then my family watched TV a bit then we heard the news:
"Murderer on the loose, the suspect was Henry Wilcox, the police are still looking for the suspect, please lock your doors and windows, call the police if you find him, we will be back with more informations."

My dad got over-positive and said it was just fake news, but my mom is still cautious and decide to lock the door and windows. I felt scared and confused, scaring about my life, our lives! Then suddenly it hit me, the figure outside the window, I got more scared and I started to have a panic attack, mom calmed me down and asked me what's going on. I told mom about that figure, she said that I don't have to worry about that, said that everything's gonna be okay. I calmed down and went to bed.

As I was half asleep, I heard knockings om the door, I thought to myself that that was probably the wind. Then the knocks comes with laughters, I began worrying and yelled for help, my dad who was watching football rushed inside my bedroom, asked if I was okay. I said I heard knockings and laughters outside. He said it was probably my imagination, and he tucked me to the bed and kissed me goodnight.

I tried to went to sleep but I couldn't because I got a train of thoughts in my head. I thought for a while but the knockings and laughters came back, this time, it's even louder. I yelled, but no one came. Then all of a sudden, it stopped, then, the window opens, a tall figure climbs inside my bedroom, it then walked to the corner of the room, standing there, staring at me, I tried to not look at it, thinking to myself that it was just a dream. I need to wake up. I thought about turning on the light but the figure stood too close to the switch so it was hopeless. It continues to walk towards me. After a while, It stood real close, holding something that looks like a knife. 

"Is this... the end?" I thought to myself, but suddenly, the police barges into my room. And pointed the gun over to the shadow, there was red and blue light with loud sirens outside my window, one of the officers turned on the light, and there he is, Henry Wilcox, the murderer on the run. The cuffed him up and bring him down into the car, I witnessed that with my own eyes. I asked my mom and dad how they knew it was Henry Wilcox. My dad said because I acted weird and also he heard my conversation with mom by the kitchen's window. My mom asked what happened to John, the police said that he was killed 5 days ago, so the murderer possibly hid in John's house, waiting to strike on us.

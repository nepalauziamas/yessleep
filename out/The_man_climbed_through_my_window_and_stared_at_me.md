I live with my mom and dad in Louisinana, America. We live in a countryside house, with cows, pigs and almost everything a farm has, we live far from the city and had one neighbor,  we usually visit his house on holidays for dinner, as we see him for what he is, a family. John lives all alone, his mother died 5 years ago because of blood cancer, he has no other relatives who lives with him, no wife, no children, all he has is a pig farm his mother left for him. 

John left a note for us 3 days ago saying he'll be back after 2 days, he hasn't been back yet made us felt worried but we thought he had some urgent businesses, his house's door was locked, so are the windows, they got curtain covered every single windows. But we didn't cared much for it and we did our daily routine as usual.

One day, we were having a dinner at our house, the only person missing was John, I finished my plate and went to wash them. Then, I saw a shadow outside of the kitchen's window. I squinted my eyes, trying to clarify if it was a man or a tree. It still stood there, so I asked my mom if she saw that, she said no. I find it strange but I  just continued to do the dishes. 

Then my family watched TV a bit, after a few channels, we decided we are gonna watch the news:
"Murderer on the loose, the suspect was Henry Wilcox, the police are still looking for the suspect, please lock your doors and windows, report to the police or your nearby authorities if you find him, we will be back with more informations."

My dad got over-positive and said it was just fake news, but my mom is still very cautious, she is always like that for everything,  she decide to lock the doors and windows. I felt really scared and confused, scaring for my life, our lives! Then suddenly it hit me, the figure outside the window, I got more scared and I started to have a panic attack, mom calmed me down and asked me what was going on. I told mom about that shadow I saw earlier, she said that I don't have to be worried about that, and she said that everything's gonna be okay. I tried to calmed down and went to bed.

I couldn't sleep because of all the thoughts in my head, I stayed up for like 1 or 2 am in the morning, then, I heard knockings on the door, I thought to myself that it was probably the wind. Then the knockings comes with laughters, more like cackles, I began worrying and yelled for help, my dad who was watching football rushed inside my bedroom, asked if I was okay. I said I heard knockings and laughters outside. He said it was probably my imagination, I tried to convice him that it wasn't, then he said that it's going to be okay, and he tucked me to the bed and kissed me goodnight.

I tried to went to sleep again but I couldn't because I got a train of thoughts in my head. I thought for a while but the knockings and laughters came back, this time, it's even louder. I yelled, but no one came, not a single soul heard my screams. Then all of a sudden, it stopped, then, the window opened, a tall shadow climbed inside my bedroom, it looked like a grown man to me, it then walked to the corner of the room, standing there, staring at me, I tried not to look at it, thinking to myself that it was just a dream. I need to wake up. I thought about turning on the light but the man stood too close to the switch so it was hopeless. It then walked towards me. After a while, It stood real close, holding something that looks like a knife. 

"Is this... the end?" I thought to myself, but suddenly, the police barges into my room. And pointed the gun over to the man, there was red and blue light with loud sirens outside my window, one of the officers turned on the lights, and there he is, Henry Wilcox, the murderer on the run. They cuffed him up and bring him down into the car, I saw that with my own eyes, I sighed with relief and cried a little, it was joyful tears. I began to ask my mom and dad how they knew it to call the cops. My dad said because I acted weird and also he overheard my conversation with mom by the kitchen's window. My mom asked what happened to John, the police said that he was killed 5 days ago, so the murderer possibly hid in John's house, waiting to strike on us.

We then rushed to John's house, only to see a crime scene, with blood all over the place, yellow and black tapes all over and a white string line in the shape of how John died. One of the officers informed us that he was stabbed 47 times, right in the spine, also got chopped up intp pieces with his heaf cutted in half, I couldn't help but broke down into tears, knowing the man who took me to wonderful places and bought me beautiful stuffs, now has been dead by a sick psychopath, I then ran straight towards Henry, while curses him with tears rolling down my cheek, my parents and other officers stopped me, my mom and dad cried but tried to hide it, that event traumatized me for life, we moved at the end of the month.

I am a 24 year old male who has been in and out of fast food jobs for the past few years, I live in a small apartment with some animals I work hard to feed. Y’know, like 2 cats. I’ve had trouble keeping a job off and on, so you don’t understand how excited I got when I saw a application for the old chuck e’ cheese. I have been there so much as a kid, the arcade styled carpet, the pizza that looks weird, the many arcade games, and man the tokens. Good times all around. I looked at the pay, *”Come on down! $2,300 a week for all-night janitors!”* I read it again to make sure I wasn’t dreaming. I instantly dialed the number, and the person on the receiver just asked a few strange questions.

“Can you follow rules clearly and quick?” The person asked. I thought nothing of it, and gave a quick yes.

“Are you alone?” Again, a weird question but, I quickly disregarded it.

“Get here as fast as you can.” I immediately felt a smile on my face as I quickly got dressed, and got out the door. I had a job, amazing pay for a week’s worth.

It was approximately 10:34 PM whenever I had arrived. I parked my car, a old man was waiting at the front counter for me. He gave me a glare, and pushed away my hand when I reached out the shake his.

“You follow the rules, you live another day, you get paid.” He instantly said after a long silence. This is where I actually began to have common sense. “What?” I asked. “You heard me, that’s why the pay is so high. You risk your life to make big money.” He said. “Do you want the job or not?”

I kept pondering for a while. “Yeah, i’ll take it.” the thoughts over my cats needing food, and the fact rent was due next week outweighed the creepy factor. He shoved a folded up paper in my hands, put on his hat and walked out. “Good luck, you’ll need it.” It was the last thing he said before the door shut completely.

I opened the paper and began to quickly look over the rules written in neat handwriting of what I needed to follow. It had to be easy rules right? I was so wrong, there was so much to take in. I now begin to read the rules written again.

*1. Chuck is never allowed to leave the stage, at any point while you are cleaning and chuck leaves, please use the stage call to get him back.*

*2. Anyone who comes in after 12:45 is not human, you are to go on a “smoke break” and go outside to the back and wait for them to come out before going back in and and continuing your job.”*

*3. Leave the kitchen to the cook, or you will be the next. batch of pizza sauce on his orders.*

*4. Pay no attention to who shows up in the mirrors in the bathroom, they may appear as friends, family, who knows. Ignore them.*

*5. Treat the empty costume that roams around as a real person, if it is to react to you, beat it until it’s lifeless.*

*6. If anyone comes in and they appear to look like me, immediately escort them outside.*

*7. Pasqually shakes violently every hour, scream as loud as you can until the shadows surround you. Do not pay attention to them and just point at pasqually. They will take care of the issue. Go back to your job as they walk forward in-front of you immediately.*

*8. At exactly 2:35 AM, make as much noise as you can. This is to keep THEM from getting inside.*

*9. If you are ever to get hungry, sit at a table and wait to be served. You are to eat whatever they bring you. Whatever you do, DO NOT look at the server in the eyes.*

*10. I will show up every night around 2 AM. Follow any order I give you.*

*11. Anything you see in the corner of your eye is not real, don’t feed into it no matter how much they plead.*

*12. You are to always have a mop with you, this is to fool the shadows.*

*13. The other workers are not human, you may speak to them, but if they ever ask about replacing chuck, ignore them.*

*14. Steal from the cash register if munch is to ever leave. It will buy you time to survive.*

*15. The building locks when I leave, and unlocks at 9AM. The building unlocks when you need to follow rule 2 and rule 6.*

*16. The robots will appear to always be watching you. They are, pay no attention to them.*

*17. You are not allowed to quit until your first week is over.*

*18. If noises start to come from the ceiling, start ranting about how awful the place is until the noise ceases.*

*19. There is a can of gasoline and a lighter under the counter, you are to set fire to anything with a pentagram on it.*

*20. Never question anything weird.*

It was a-lot to take in. I immediately grabbed the mop next to me, and folding up the paper putting it in my pocket. I moved to the main area, immediately mopping the floor. I had the unnerving feeling that I was being watched. I checked my phone, the time read 12:20 AM. I had a long night before me. I started to move my head up to meet the gaze’s on me, and stopped. I remembered the rules. I began to ponder what would happen to me if I broke it and looked up. 

I looked up not catching their gaze. Chuck had been gone. I went over to the stage, trying to find the stage call button. It was on the right, on the inside of a panel. I pushed the button, and heard loud moving as chuck returned to his spot.

I looked at the other robots, all of them were there. I began to clean the tables of all the messes left by kids in the morning. I felt a cold hand touch my shoulder which made me jump. I turned to face a worker in a chuck-e-cheese’s outfit. She gave me a smile. There was something off about her. She has overly large eyes, a mouth folded back onto her face, her nose bulbous and covered with scales. “Hey there! You the new guy?” She had asked me. “Uh, yeah.” I said.

“How would you feel about helping me in the kitchen?” She asked quickly. “No i’m fine.” I said quickly remembering the rule about the kitchen.

“What about replacing chuck?” I opened my mouth to awnser, but my mind immediately told me to shut up. I turned away from her, and she let out a screech. She begged and begged for a awnser, but I kept ignoring her pleas. She finally gave up, leaving.

I sighed, cleaning the tables again. I heard movement on the stage and noticed munch getting up. As soon as we locked eyes, he immediately got back into position. 

I suddenly realized this was not a job to make money, it was a entire battle for my life.

I was surfing on the net the other day, trying to find something to save me from boredom and I came across this blog called mxxxxx.blogspot.com. At first, I thought it may be some vent blog created by a troubled teen or something, but when I read some entries I realized it was deeper than that. I didn't know what to do so I came here to see if someone could help me.

Here's some of the entries:

I\`m really worried. I found this old will from my grandad and I think it may be related to that case. If what it says here is true, dad is in serious problems. I’ll update more once I get more information.

*June 6th:*

I talked to mom about the crime, but she said that she didn’t knew much about it. She didn’t live here when it happened, so I guess it makes sense; the information she told me was the one I saw in that newspaper, so it didn’t help at all. I’ll try to ask my neighbor to see if he knows anything else.

*June 8th:*

I talked with Pete and told me everything I needed to know, now I’m able to put the whole story together. I’ll write down all the information I got and I’ll make a single update about it.

*June 13th:*

I think he saw me. Dad saw the will when I was taking it to my room. He knows I know. I can’t trust him, not after I know the truth. I’m scared, what should I do? What if it 's true? What if dad is really a murderer?  I can’t believe he would do such a thing, but there’s way too much proof…

*June 18th:* 

I talked with grandma last night to catch up with her. Suddenly, I mentioned my dad and she mentioned how much she disliked him. She said that from the very first moment she knew there was something wrong with him. How much she couldn’t stand that creepy smile of his. I never thought dad’s smile was weird, but that comment made me think of what Pete said…

*June 25th:*

So, here’s the thing. About 30 years ago, there was this horrible crime where I live. My town is really small, but back in the day it used to be a really touristic place where every summer our inns got filled with tourists. But after this happened, it became a small and desolated town where each year that goes by people leave to go to the city and never come back.

On July 7th, two 4 years-old twins, Anna and Paul, disappeared while playing on the playground near the town square. This caused a huge commotion, since they were well known and loved by everyone here and nobody could ever imagine something happening to them.The police began searching almost immediately but nothing was found. Each neighbor was interrogated, including tourists, but apparently no one saw them that day or saw anything slightly suspicious.

The investigation got cold, until October 19th. The remains of the twins appeared in the middle of the town square. Everyone was horrified. Who could have been so cruel to keep the bodies for that long and then place them where everybody could see them? The autopsies took place some days after and it revealed that the siblings died a couple of days after their disappearance. 

There weren't any clues about who could have been. The only information they got was from Nana, an old woman who runs a candy shop near the playground. She said that a strange man, clearly from out of the town, was near the place where the twins disappeared. He was tall, blond and had brown pants with a blue t-shirt. Pete told me that Nana also said that one time he entered her shop and she saw his face, but the police didn’t believed her description because “it didn’t give any substancial clues". Nana said that, when she saw his face, a chill went across her spine; the man had this deadly stare and a smile that could give anyone nightmares, including the bravest man in the world.

Every house was searched, but no clue was ever found. The only house that wasn't searched was this old mansion in the hill, since the entry and windows were blocked and nobody had lived there in almost 50 years. When the police contacted one of the old owners' sons, he said that the new owner was his brother, but he lived in France, so it was impossible for him to be there when the crime took place.

After a year or two, the case was closed and no one was found guilty. This brought a really bad reputation to the town and it made everyone paranoid, thinking that any neighbor could be a killer.

I never really cared about this case, not until I found the will in which my dad was made the owner of the mansion we now live in and when I found that secret entry in the backyard.

An entry from where the killer could have entered the house and killed the twins in the basement. Which would explain the weird brown-ish stains near the sink.

Dad has been really weird these days. He’s been running errands every day, saying he had some important things to take care of. He’s never been that busy before. At least, he hasn’t brought up anything about me taking the will or giving me the cold shoulder, so I guess we’re fine by now.

&#x200B;

*July 6th:*

I'm still confused by everything I found these days. I don't want to believe it. My dad isn't a murderer, I know he isn't. But, what if he really is? What if he was the one who made that terrible thing to the twins? 

I have this horrible feeling, like something really bad is about to happen. I discovered this tool the other day which gives me the possibility  to programate my post. I decided to activate in case something happens. This way I'll be able to continue posting the drafts I have save or any post that could be left incomplete.

I don't know if anyone will ever find this blog, but I just want to make sure that, in case I couldn't update anymore, the person who find this will have all the information needed.

*July 7th:*

I’m scared. It’s 2.30 am and I heard some noises from the basement. I think it 's dad. Yesterday he made some comments about how the town’s mayor mentioned the anniversary of the twins’ death and how he couldn’t stop himself from thinking about them whenever he saw me and my brother. He said that some neighbors found some resemblance between them and my brother and I and that he thought the same after seeing some old pictures of them. 

He also mentioned how he was in a town near here when the crime took place. Apparently, he was on a business trip and the crime shocked even the people in the other town.

My brother told me he caught dad staring at him sleeping the other night and how he saw him carrying some tools to the basement. Mom's out of town for a few days. I want to call her, but she’s probably sleeping and I don't want dad to hear me.

I think I heard him coming upstairs. He’s entering Mark’s room.

Mark screamed. I’m trembling. I don’t know what to do. I don’t think I’ll be able to run away at this point.

He’s coming to my room, I can hear his steps.

Shit, he’s herftujs

I searched everywhere trying to find information about the crime she was talking about or a recent disappearance, but I couldn't find anything. I’m really worried though. In the blog, there was a link that led to the girls' personal instagram. I went through some of her photos and a lot of her friends were commenting about missing her and things like that.

&#x200B;

I’m not really sure what has happened to her, even though I can imagine. I’ll keep searching to see if I can find anything. If anyone has any information, I would be very glad to hear it. Any theories about what could have happened would be appreciated as well.

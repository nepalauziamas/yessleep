Oranges, their so round but they have the nice taste. Did you know? When you open them up they look all watery they gush liquids out making your fingers sticky. Did you know? Well my wife knew she liked oranges, she actually liked them quite a lot. Until the other day that is, she hasn't touched them not once, not even a LICK. But thats okay you know? People change, so does their thoughts... Hey you know that meat has protein? Yeah my wife told me that too well sort OF... Talking about meat my children love a good steak. They like the juicy bits, they chew on it until the meat is dry. You Know? Well they do, they are the ones that do it. Well as of recent they haven't gotten their steak guess they went vegetarians. As a matter of fact they haven't been making noise wonder why that is. I should probably check on them? Nah its up to them if they want to make noise? You know? Like if they die thats when it is a problem right? Well I think they know I SURE DO. You Know flies are annoying they get in your way just like pesky nosy adults! Like why bother being so nosy its my house why are you assaulting me! You Know? Yeah they knew, they knew for a good minute then they stopped... Hey you know what a human looks like...

SHHHHHHH! They are here. You Know? Wait! Did you know the best place to hide is somewhere in near sight? Of course you know? Right? I mean who hasn't played cops and robbers. Wait! You know 4 men against 1 is a terrible odd? They find you quicker you know? Unless you are sneaky. You Know? Oh! Hey son. What are you doing here? Do you know whats happening? Hey why don't you talk? Cat got your tongue? Well I will leave you here so they do not find you as well as your brother. You Know? Of course you do! Now remain silent please!

You know a good place to hide would be your bedroom? You know? Because you know every square inch of it. Oh Hey honey and is that turner with you well let me help you guys to a safer place! Oh this secrete door would do! No one would find you in there, well at-least not until a couple of years. AM I RIGHT! Now remain this silent! You know? Now that everyone is hidden I can finally hide without any anxiety. You Know?  Oh! Did you Know that the best spot to hide is somewhere far away? I mean how will they find you silly! They are not that fast.

Too bad I never had a family like this, hopefully one day i get one just like them! SO NICE! Well until next time. Wouldn't want to get in trouble he he...

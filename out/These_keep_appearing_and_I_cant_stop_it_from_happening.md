I used to live in a small house in a very underpopulated town. It was a day like the others. I had gotten home from my shift at the office. My job wasn't to type on a computer for hours on
end. No. My job was to be a security guard at night time. I had my own security card so I could get out once my shift was over, because the workplace had its doors locked during closing 
hours. When I looked at my phone, I noticed it was 13:00. "Weird...", I thought to myself. "My phone must've glitched out, because it was past dark. I ignored it for now and decided to go to 
sleep. I wasn't really hungry, which was weird, considering that I usually was very hungry after work and usually ate at least something before going to bed. My clock had stopped working at 
my office so I just had to look out the window to see if it was dark outside. Just before going to bed, I checked out my window to see if I had dreamed of it being dark outside. It was dark, 
so I wasn't wrong. However, I couldn't spot the moon. I thought that it was because it was cloudy outside, but I was wrong. Very wrong. I went to bed, but I had trouble sleeping. I looked at 
my phone, and it was now 13:13. I decided to look at my watch. Same time. My clock. Same time. What was going on? After endless amounts of trying to fall asleep, I finally did. 

When I woke up, it was still dark outside. I knew that I wouldn't have slept for long. However, when I checked my phone, it was 22:36. I looked outside again, and I could now see the moon. I checked all of my devices, and they all had the same time. Everything was alright, until I took a closer look outside and noticed dark figures. My heart stopped. I felt my stomach sinking. I knew 
something was up. Next day, same thing happened. 13:00, 22:00, dark figures outside. 

The next day, I called my workplace and told them I wasn't going to be there because I needed to see a therapist. My boss wasn't too happy, but he agreed that mental health was prioritized over work. I saw a therapist, and they diagnosed me with Shizophrenia. I thought that too, so I took the 
prescribed medications the therapist gave to me. When I took them, the dark figures were already there, but they didn't disappear. Nothing did. The next day, I bought bear traps and thought that if they really were hallucinations, the traps wouldn't get activated. I laid them down and hoped for the best.

It was night time. The dark figures were here. I thought they were hallucinations before, but this proved me wrong. One of them fell to the ground. I didn't think much of it. The next day, I noticed that the bear trap where the dark figure fell was closed. 

I now live in a suburban area since.

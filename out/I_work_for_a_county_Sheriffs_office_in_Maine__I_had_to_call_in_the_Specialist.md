I don’t remember it. I don’t remember getting up, or navigating to the kitchen, and I most definitely do not recall taking a knife from the knife block. What I can recollect however, is my pinky toe bending at a right angle as I slammed it into the edge of the couch hard enough to wake myself up.

Pain radiated up my body and the blade I had been holding clattered to the floor narrowly missing my other foot. To say I was confused is an understatement, it took me a few moments to understand where I was and what had happened. You see, I used to sleep walk as a child, but I hadn’t in years. So while I was surprised it wasn’t exactly something that had never happened to me, though, I’ll concede I hadn’t sleep carried around knives before.

After picking up the knife I hobbled back to the kitchen, I intended to get a glass of water, put the knife back, and go back to bed. However, as soon as I entered the room I realised that wasn’t going to happen. The area was a disaster zone. Half emptied food containers were strewn across the bench, left overs I had stored carefully were now sitting half eaten out in the air.

A carton of milk lay on it’s side, the milk flooded over the countertop and had puddled on the floor, splattering the entirety of the cupboards below as it did. Sleepy and annoyed I was in no way prepared to deal with this mess, but it wasn’t something I could just leave until morning. I set about cleaning up as I cursed myself. Of course I couldn’t remember making the calamity that was before me, but I supposed I was hungry and the sleep walking was a result of that. I was probably lucky I didn’t chop my fingers off while trying to make a snack.

By the time I got things back in order I decided there was no point in trying to go back to sleep. Since I had the day off I planned to make the most of it, get some chores out the way, go shopping, maybe get a meal at the diner. The pin prick on my hand from the charm was bothering me slightly. Overnight it had become swollen and itchy. I thought it must have become infected or that the poison in the thorns was lingering, so I agreed with myself that the infirmary would be my first stop.

I sat in the waiting room at the doctors surgery for what felt like an eternity. I found myself falling into a kind of trance as I listened to the hum of the office fish tank, the gentle bubbling of the air stone was strangely irritating. The overhead lights seemed too bright and the sound of other people in the waiting room merely breathing was too loud.

An uncomfortable anger was starting to burn in my veins then a strange idea came to me. It manifested as a suggestion that passed through my mind as if someone had whispered it in my ear.. *Shoot everyone*. The words were crystal clear. It felt like someone poured a bucket of ice water over me and I heard myself take a sharp breath in. The notion horrified me, I had no idea where that kind of violent thought came from.

Of course I carry a weapon for work, but I had never found it necessary to fire it at another ***human*** person before, let alone ever thought about shooting up a room full of innocent people. I cannot express the relief I felt knowing I wasn’t carrying on my day off. When my name was called it was as if a bubble burst and I realised I had been staring at the floor for some time.

“Sorry, that’s me.” I apologised, they must’ve called me more than once, I just hadn’t heard.

“It’s quite alright, what can I do for you today?” The doctor asked as we sat in his office. He was a well built man, taller than I with ginger hair and light eyes. I read on his name tag that his name was Dr. Sean Dempsey.

“Well.. I think this might be infected.” I answered, offering him my hand so that he could see the puffy reddened mark.

“Alright, let’s have a look.” He mused, taking my hand and examining it, “Does it hurt or itch? Can you close your hand?”

In response to his question I opened and closed my hand, “I can, but it does hurt a little bit, and it is itchy.” I agreed.

“It’s quite strange, it almost looks like you’ve been stamped or something. How did it happen?”

“Stamped?” I asked dumbly, looking at it more closely. I hadn’t really looked at it that much, but I realised he was correct, it looked like I had hit something hard enough that it left the imprint of an object on my skin. Though what kind of object makes a seven pointed star shape on skin I’m not sure, “I picked up a thing wrapped in thorns.” I went on to explain.

“What kind of thorns?” He asked raising an eye brow.

“I don’t know.. Pointy ones?” I struggled.

“Right. And how do you feel? Any fatigue, nausea, muscle weakness?” Dr. Dempsey quizzed me further though I could tell he was less than satisfied with my answer.

“I’m a bit tired, but that’s just because I didn’t sleep well last night. But otherwise I’m fine. Some joint soreness, though that’s just from work.” I said tranquilly.

“What do you do for work?” he inquired.

“I work at the Sheriff’s Station, sometimes out at the ranger station too.” I answered honestly, I couldn’t see why that mattered but I noticed the Doctor hesitate slightly.

“And you say it was an object wrapped in thorns that started this?” He asked to clarify.

“Yeah, I was taking down some halloween decorations in the woods, just stuff kids put up.” I explained vaguely.

“I see. There are a lot of unsavoury plants out there. I’m going to write you a prescription for some light antibiotics. Take them once a day with food. You’ll be fine.” He assured, turning in his chair to start scribbling on the paper. I couldn’t help but feel unnerved that he felt the need to tell me that I would ‘be fine’. I wasn’t previously worried that I wouldn’t be.

Leaving the doctors office I picked up my new drugs and made my way to the local diner. Millie’s Diner was situated on the corner between the road and the park at the end of the Main Street. It has a window that opens to the street for passers by, booth style seating inside and extra tables on the sidewalk for outdoor seating. It’s usually busy and you can always smell the baked goods even before you cross the street.

I chose to sit inside in one of the booths and looked over the menu. Truth be told I was a regular and almost always ordered the same thing: a coffee with one sugar, a juicy steak with eggs, mash and a side of toast, which I was rather looking forward to.

“Charles, are you pretending to read the menu again?” I was called out almost immediately as the waitress came over to me. She was carrying with her the days paper and a mug of coffee. Her name was Jessica, she had been the year above me in high school and when she smiled her cheeks held small dimples.

Her hair was a wavy dark brown, long, and tied into a high pony tail as it always was when she worked. Her eyes were a deep brown and she was wearing a white apron with a strawberry patten on it. That wasn’t part of the cafe uniform, but I suppose when your father is the owner, you can wear what you like.

“That obvious?” I asked embarrassed with a sheepish smile.

“The usual then?” Jess asked returning the smile warmly as she set down the coffee and paper for me. I realised then that she must’ve anticipated and made it the minute I walked in. She also didn’t have to bring the paper, but she knew I liked to read it so she often brought it over for me.

“That would be great, thanks.” I agreed, I could feel my ears turning flush, I had no way to thank her enough for the kindness.

“Coming right up!” She assured turning on her heels to leave. I watched her go and lamented on the fact that I hadn’t been brave enough to speak to her in high school before turning my attention to the newspaper.

I was about a quarter of the way through the first article and deep in thought when someone silently slid into the seat opposite me. I can’t say that I really noticed them at all until they spoke, it was as if they simply appeared in the space before me.

“Do you always turn so red when pretty girls speak with you?” I recognised the voice instantly. Eric Linnaeus. I put down the paper to look at him and was surprised to see him in casual dress. He wore a white top under an open wool jacket with a high collar. As always the right hand sleeve was empty with his arm wrapped and slung across his body.

Instead of being combed back, his dark hair hung forward covering his right eye. It’s strange to say, but he looked almost angelic without his darkened eye immediately visible and I had never before noticed just how ocean blue his left eye was. He set his cane down beside him and let it rest leaning against the table.

“Have you ever considered wearing a cat bell? You know, so you don’t give people heart attacks.” I muttered in return ignoring his question entirely.

“If you were paying more attention to your surroundings I wouldn’t have startled you.” He responded smoothly.

“I was reading! That’s perfectly reasonable.” I insisted.

“If you say so.” He shrugged but I got the feeling he was somehow amused.

“What are you doing here?” I grumbled dejected, I noticed then that since he had sat down the mark on my hand begun to ache.

Looking him up and down Eric seemed well. Despite his right arm being bandaged, as it always was, it looked okay. The damage from Oklahoma appeared to be healed and he looked healthy. However I couldn’t help but feel somewhat anxious seeing him. I hadn’t gotten around to calling him and I was beginning to realise that part of me was worried. Though about what exactly I couldn’t precisely say.

“Your Sheriff called me, and given how much the man hates me, I supposed it was important. He’s worried about you.” Eric said calmly, though I could feel his gaze on me, as if he was analysing my every movement.

I shifted uncomfortable in my seat, “I’m fine. Some kids put up Halloween decorations in the woods, Sheriff had me take them down. It’s not a big issue. He gave me the day off today but I’m fine.” I assured.

“May I see your hand?” He requested, holding out his left hand for mine.

I hesitated a moment, I hadn’t told him that my hand was injured. Subconsciously I had even been directing it away from him, so how did he know? Did the Sheriff tell him? I’m not sure why it bothered me, I didn’t want him to look at it or touch it. A tense moment of silence passed between us before Eric spoke once more.

“I’m not going to ask you again.” His voice held no agitation though he articulated the words firmly and I understood that he wasn’t making a request.

I swallowed, “Sorry. It’s really fine. I have meds for it.” I tried as I reluctantly offered my limb.

Eric didn’t say anything further as he looked over my hand. I’m a little ashamed to say that I thought his hand would be, *inhuman*, in some way or another. Cold or something. But it wasn’t. It was as normal as anyone else’s. He examined the mark for a long moment, it had darkened over the course of the day with the lines of the star-like shape becoming more pronounced.

He ran his thumb over it lightly and I winced. A hot pain radiated through my fingertips and up the length of my arm. It hadn’t hurt like that when the Doctor had looked it over and I realised that it was reacting specifically to Eric, as if his touch somehow made the mark angry.

“You can breathe Charles.” He reminded me without emotion as he took his hand back from mine. I felt shame in the pit of my stomach. I’m sure he felt my hesitation to touch his hand, “Tell me, what did the cursed object look like?” He asked now.

“Cursed object?” I echoed confused.

“The ‘Halloween decorations’.” He clarified.

“Oh… They were circular, just made of plastic and thread.” I elaborated vaguely.

“Charles.” He sighed with a hint of annoyance, he knew I was being deliberately vague. I don’t know why I felt so nervous, this man had risked his life for mine twice and I trusted him. Or at least, I thought I did.

“Someone must’ve went the extra mile for their make believe seance, one of the decorations was.. A bit more.. Realistic. Than the rest.” I admitted unwillingly.

“I’m going to assume it was this ‘realistic’ one that cut your hand? Did you *see* anything after it tasted your blood? Has anything *unusual* happened since?”

I swallowed anxiously. My lips felt dry, the way he said it had ’tasted my blood’ was disturbing. I was about to answer him honestly when the word came to me.. *Lie*. It was clear and compelling, I thought about it a moment longer before I answered, “No..” I murmured weakly, “No I didn’t see anything. Nothing strange has happened, it’s all very normal.” I lied more confidently.

Whatever his thoughts Eric’s expression betrayed nothing and I couldn’t tell if he believed me or not. I thought he would answer me when Jess returned to the table. I realised then that he must have seen her coming and decided to wait before saying anything more. She set down my plate and cutlery then turned to Eric with a sorry expression.

She was apologising to him, saying how she thought I was dining alone and asking if she could get him something. He declined politely but in truth I couldn’t hear the words properly for another thought entered my mind.. ***Kill Him. Do it now!*** The words were icy, I don’t know where they came from but I felt myself break into a cold sweat.

Somewhere in my mind I was aware that I had taken a hold of the steak knife that came with my meal. I was gripping it so tightly that my knuckles had turned white, ***Kill Him***. The suggestion came again more firmly this time and I struggled to ignore it, the compulsion was so strong that I could see how to do it. Stab him with the knife, catch him by surprise…

“Charles.” Eric’s voice was low and calm, it broke through whatever spell was over me. Jess had walked away at some point while I was consumed with my thoughts and all of Eric’s attention was now focused on me. I let go of the knife, it clanked loudly off the table to the floor but I made no move to retrieve it. I was trembling with adrenaline and when I looked back up at Eric I could see that he was tense.

His hair was now pushed aside slightly and his right eye was locked on me. I felt a chill of fear run down my spine. It was the eye of a predator and he was ready to attack, I was sure this was the way he looked at the things he killed. I thought for one delirious moment that he was somehow able to see my thoughts, that he knew what I was thinking and was ready to end me.

He watched me for a long moment before he seemed to relax, “I wasn’t going to hurt you. I’m *Not* going to hurt you. I was only going to stop you if necessary..”. I must have looked afraid because he spoke more softly to me then and smoothed his hair back over his right eye, “However,” he continued, “I do want to know what happened just then. What did you hear?”

“I…” I struggled to begin, maybe it was the lack of sleep, or the violence of the thought or the shame I felt, “N-Nothing, I.. I was just.. Day dreaming is all..” I decided not to tell him that I thought to murder him, just in case he changed his mind.

“Look at me.” Eric ordered and I reluctantly met his gaze, “I can’t help you if you keep lying to me.”

In response to his words I heard the voice clearly in my mind again.. ***He’s going to kill you.*** I felt sick. Panic was bubbling up in my chest, it was hard to breathe, I felt like everyone was staring at me, “I have to go.” I told him quickly and got up to leave. I fled Millie’s without eating and I don’t know if Eric followed or not as I walked hastily to my car.

Outside the cool air helped calm my nerves. I hadn’t fully realised until then how warm I felt in the diner, it was like I was burning up from the inside out, they must have had the heaters up too high I rationalised. I drove with no destination in mind and without any specific direction, I just wanted to get away.

I rolled the windows down and turned the radio up to drown out my thoughts. It didn’t help much. The mark on my palm burned and the same notion played in my mind repeatedly, ***Kill him kill him KILL HIM!***. It was hysterical, not like it was before. Previously it had been a whisper, a suggestion. Now it was like a toddler throwing a tantrum after their parent had denied them candy.

Some part of me knew that it wanted Eric dead because he threatened it. But I also understood that if this voice was now a part of me, and it compelled me to try to kill him.. That he would kill me. I didn’t know what to do, I felt pure dread thinking about it. I had to get rid of the mark and it’s curse on my own. Only I had no idea how to do that. I couldn’t even bring myself to accept what it was or that it was happening to me.

After some time the voice began to subside. Honestly I think it just ran out of the energy to keep screaming at me, and I found myself travelling along a seldom used service road in silence. I recognised it because it was the one that travelled along side the park. I’d used it last year to evacuate some hikers when a small brush fire came through.

I continued along it until I heard my car make the sad sounds of a vehicle running out of gas, filling it should have been on my list for the day, but I hadn’t expected to drive for so long. I pulled to a stop in the middle of the trail and just sat in my car for a long time. Deciding what to do next was the hardest part. The car wasn’t going to make it back and my cell phone, for the brick that it was at the time, had no reception.

The idea that I might be spending the night in the woods didn’t bother me especially. What more was in those woods that could scare me now? Still, I decided that I would go for a walk to try and find some signal. I picked the direction that lead to the nearest hill and set off into the forest making my own path.

As it would turn out I was wrong about the forest. It did bother me for it was entirely silent. The foliage varied in density so that sometimes I could walk between the trees freely while other times I had to push my way clumsily through the undergrowth. Before long the daylight began to fade and the woods seemed to come alive.

I became certain that there were things following after me. Creatures hidden among the elongated shadows of the trees watching me as I made the decision to return to the car and abandon my mission for signal. However, it was when I turned back that I saw her.. The burned woman, crawling out of the trees toward me on bent limbs and slowly beginning to stand upright.

This time I had the good sense to run.

She shrieked after me but I didn’t look back. I ran like a track star through those woods, vaulting over logs and ducking under branches. Part of me knew of course that it was pointless. I had no where to go, I was marked and I regretted leaving my gun at home. Not that I truely believed it would have been of any help in this situation.

***Stop***.

The command came and I felt my body seize up. A fresh wave of panic consumed me, I understood that now that she was close she could control me more easily and I fought for my autonomy back. I could feel my limbs twisting unnaturally against my will, they bent in ways that my joints weren’t made to bend. It was like someone was reaching inside me and before long I was writhing on the ground in agony.

I heard my shoulder dislocate as the entity willed it to happen and I shouted in pain. She was punishing me for running. From my vantage point in the mud I saw her walking over, she was moving slowly and that was somehow worse. Every step she took was disjointed.

When she reached me she crouched down and stroked the side of my face with her hand, she opened her mouth as if she was talking and the words came to me, ***Young. Handsome***. Somehow the compliments didn’t hit the mark. The her skin was made of shrivelled back peels, the same as when a heat source is held close to plastic and each layer melts back individually.

She smelled of charred flesh. I tried to will my body to move but I had no control left. She then took my marked hand in her hands and pressed it to her face, she seemed pleased in a repulsive way. ***Mine.*** I shuddered involuntarily. Then the worst thing I have ever experienced happened.

The burned woman began to pick at the flesh of my hand, she was pulling back strips of the star that had formed and was dribbling black fluid from her mouth into the wound. I could feel her flowing? Into my body through the mark. That’s not accurate.. But I have no better way to describe it. She was infesting my body with her very being.

It felt like boiled water was being injected through my veins, the pain was excruciating, it was worse than what I had experienced in Oklahoma. Though, the entire process didn’t take long. As her physical manifestation disappeared I could feel her will being imposed on my body and my own conscious thoughts being suppressed. It was unnatural, unholy, violating in every sense of the word as my limbs moved under her direction.

I..? She..? We. Stood, and she forced me to walk forward. I could feel her emotions, she was pleased, ecstatic. I supposed she wanted a whole body again and now she had mine. Our focus landed on a circular arrangement of twigs not to far from us and I heard the sounds of young birds moving nervously in the nest. ***Food.*** We thought and I understood that she wanted to eat. She was going to make us eat those birds alive and I knew it.

My unfiltered terror pleased her and I felt my lips pulling themselves into a smile. Thankfully, we didn’t take more than a single step towards those baby birds before I suddenly felt a jolt of malice mixed with nervousness? For a moment I couldn’t think what would make this thing anxious. Then I saw it.

Nearing us from the left was a dark shape. Through the witches eyes over my own I could see the form of a human wrapped in a writhing mass of dusky energy. It approached through the darkness and as the figure stepped out of the trees into the clearing with us the moonlight hit him. I realised then that it was Eric.

The energy flickered around him like a flame casting off sparks into the night air. It covered him entirely though it was primarily focused around the upper right hand side of his body. I noticed that it was a translucent grey, or maybe a blue turned grey in the darkness, I couldn’t really tell. When he stepped out of the shadow the energy almost seemed to shimmer. It was… Oddly beautiful, and I’m sure my human eyes would never have been able to see it on their own.

In addition to the peculiar energy surrounding him Eric’s right eye was also strangely bright. It reflected back at us like a mountain cat’s eye in the shine of a flashlight. He stretched out his inhuman arm and the claws extended. I felt a doubled wave of fear flood through me, it was both mine and the burned woman’s, we knew he was there to kill us.

“I’m sorry.” Eric spoke, his gaze rested on us and I felt that he was looking through the witch to speak to me directly. I wanted to answer him, to tell him it was okay. But she disallowed me to speak. I felt the witches energy start to swell, it was like nausea and I could tell we were about to attack him.

Before I knew it was happening the witch launched us at him. The magic that leaked out of me from her burned the ground where Eric once stood but he had already moved. He was too fast I thought, remembering his speed every other time I had seen him fight and I experienced the witch’s resentment at that information. That was almost pleasing to me. I knew he would win, I would die and so would this entity inside me.

The fight didn’t last long, we were in fact severely out powered. The one time Eric didn’t move aside he caught my arm by the wrist in his right hand and I felt his magic smother the witch’s. His claws cut into my skin without any pressure at all and I felt blood running down my arm.

In moments he had us pinned to the ground. I should probably, at this point mention that I’m just over 6ft tall and while Eric is slightly shorter than I am, his weight on my chest was crushing me. I’m sure that he was unnaturally heavy, he’s probably made of stone or something. I closed my eyes and the witch allowed me to do so, I guess, she didn’t want to see us die either.

As I waited, I felt his claws at my throat and knew that soon I would be dead.. But that was alright.. I would die without having hurt anyone or eaten any birds because he stopped us from doing so. Then to my shock, Eric spoke, “Leave him.” He commanded, the anger in his voice was vicious. I opened my eyes and was surprised to see his face scrunched into an expression of pure fury. I don’t think I have ever seen anyone look so mad, let alone Eric, who’s emotional range had previously been limited to the slightest hints of amusement.

There was a moment of pause from the witch, I felt her confusion, then her understanding as she took the opportunity. Immediately I felt her presence receding from my body, she left the same way she entered through the curse on my palm. I can’t say it was any less painful leaving as she was entering but it was, at least, a relief.

I didn’t see where she went after she left my body. However after I felt the last of her existence leave, I expected that Eric would allow me up. But he didn’t. Instead, he stabbed a knife into the sleeve of my shirt, skewering my left arm to the ground and readjusted to hold my right arm down with his left hand on my wrist.

“What are you..-” The words died on my lips as I realised. He was restraining me now because he was going to cut off my hand, “No! Eric!” I protested urgently, “Please!”, I know it’s stupid, but I would rather be fully dead than an amputee. I couldn’t imagine living without right hand.

“Shut up.” He snapped. I couldn’t really see what he was doing, but I could feel him weaving threads over my hand. Then there was a burning sensation in my palm, not dissimilar to that of when the witch possessed me. Only this time the spread was localised and it felt like he was pulling the nerves out of it. I screamed in agony.

When it was done I saw him throw something away. I heard it land with a wet slop on the leaves somewhere in the near distance and I realised tentatively that my hand was in fact still intact, “You’re a f\* cking idiot Charles.” He scolded me. I didn’t know what to say. Without the witches eyes Eric looked quite normal in the moonlight and I saw his expression change from anger to relief.

We stared at each other for an awkward moment before we both seemed to realise that he was *still* sitting on top of me, holding me down with his one hand on my chest and the other on my wrist. He looked almost as surprised at this revelation as I did and he let me up. Though I didn’t try to get up immediately, my shoulder wasn’t in any good way and blood poured freely from the injuries to my hand.

“I can bandage you, but we need to get you back.” He told me now, he was eyeing off my injuries as well.

“Okay.. Just.. Give me a minute..” I agreed. Eric didn’t look pleased, but he seemed to accept my answer as he set about bandaging my wrist and hand. I noticed that the way he held the fingers on his right hand was almost uncomfortable looking. He was making an effort not to touch anything with the claws, I supposed they were sharp enough to cut through fabric and flesh without much pressure.

“Not a word, I don’t want to hear a single word.” He said firmly, catching me watching him.

I hesitated, “Two words then.. Thank you..” I murmured, I wasn’t going to miss the opportunity again.

At this he seemed genuinely embarrassed, “Never say that again.” He warned.

“You just saved my life for a third time. I owe you two other thanks as well.” I reminded him.

“Maybe next time, just don’t touch cursed objects.” He reprimanded me.

“I didn’t know it was cursed. The rest weren’t..” I muttered, I knew I had messed up. I could have hurt someone, I nearly crushed and ate raw baby birds.

Eric watched me a moment then he seemed to take pity for he chastised me kind of playfully, “You touched *more* than one? Didn’t you learn your lesson about touching things in Oklahoma?”

“You’re kind of a bastard you know that?” I grumbled.

“So I’ve been told.” He mused with a slight smile. I hate to admit it, but that actually made me feel better. His teasing was reassuring, it made me feel like he knew what he was doing and that I was going to be alright after this.

There was another deliberate moment of silence before I gathered the courage to speak again, “..Can I ask you something?”

“Perhaps..” He agreed after a moment

“When she, it.. was inside of me, I could see what she saw… “ I began.

Eric tensed, “And?” He stated dryly, his emotions returning the carefully maintained facade. I could tell he didn’t want to talk about it.

“..There’s an energy around you..” I didn’t quite know how to word what I wanted to ask.

“There’s an energy around everything.” He said flatly.

“..But yours is.. Well I mean it’s not..” I fumbled, “It’s not really human is it? You’re not really…” I trailed off and Eric turned away from me. He didn’t show any emotion but I got the distinct feeling that I had hurt him in some way.

He took in a deep breath and let it out slowly before turning back to me, “You need to get up now. It’s time to go.” He spoke calmly ignoring my question entirely as he offered me his human arm to help me up.

“Eric, I don’t mean… What I’m trying to say is.. I know, and it’s okay.” I felt awkward trying to articulate myself as I accepted his help.

“Stop talking.” He told me firmly making it clear that he wouldn’t elaborate, “I have more work to do here. The only way to kill a thing like that is if it’s in the body of someone, or to find whoever cast the original curse. The witch is still out there and you need medical attention. We’ve done enough for tonight.”

Understanding dawned on me. He had allowed the burned woman to get away in order to spare my life. That meant it was still out there, and it was still dangerous. The Sheriff would *probably* kill me if he knew I was the reason there was still a witch in our woods.

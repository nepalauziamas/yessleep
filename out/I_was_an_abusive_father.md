The man coughed over the speaker “Everything is set up for the interview you may start” I turned to the camera my young feminine face which still was unnerving showing in the reflection “Hello I am Ja-“ I coughed”Formerly James Kandon who was a 45 year old male and now  Jane Kandon a 15 year old girl..”’ 


I began my story from the start.
“I was an abusive father and husband.” I was silent for 20 seconds taking my words in “I think this was due to the fact that I had an abusive childhood and thus took it out on my family” Memories from the time my father almost chopped my hand off to my mother spitting at me came into my head “This is my story..”



“It started a year ago and my 5th year into my marriage I had a wonderful wife named Kate and my 13 year old daughter Mary and my 9 year old son Joseph. I was a stupid fool and usually hit my wife my daughter and son when they did something ‘wrong’ but the change started early December last year”


I took a breath in and continued “I was shopping for Christmas when my wife dropped something and for some absurd reason it angered me so much..” I shivered “I hit her and thinking nobody was around I continued on until I heard someone muttering” 


“I turned to face them and it was a small old lady probably around her 80s if i were to guess..she spoke up saying. “You know it’s disrespectful to hit woman young man” I said imitating her. I quickly turned to her saying “My wife is none of your concern”. She tutted “It seems you need to learn to walk in there shoes..”. I scoffed but then the most terrifying thing happened to me,the room around me turned pitch black and the lady had began floating muttering demonic words pain spread throughout my body then it all stopped..”


“Apparently my wife had seen nothing happen almost oblivious to why I was in aftershock of the pain. The old lady spoke once more “Soon you will see what it’s like to walk in the victims shoes..” I quickly shrugged this off still in a state of shock and finished our shopping quickly. When I returned home I quickly returned to my usual self noticing that one of my kids had left a toy lying around and this angered me so much and for the life of me I can and will never know why. I called them downstairs and were about to strike them when I felt a pain in my arm and stopped.”


“I told them to leave for their rooms and don’t come out for the rest of the day. That night I went to sleep further forgetting about the events. The next day I had gone to work without a problem in mind and left normal.. that was until I went to the gym when I noticed the first real changes. Now I used to be a very hairy man adding to my large 6.1 intimidating stature but I had began to notice a reduce of hair across my body but shrugged it off as either over shaving or just my mind playing tricks..”


“By the time it became Christmas I wasn’t very hairy but by dumb stupid self just didn’t pinpoint on why and continued being abusive as normal. Christmas was when the real change started and I noticed on that day I felt weaker and my muscles smaller which was true I also had become 6’0. This caused me to rush to the doctors and they ran some test saying that nothing was wrong with me..” 

“Over the next two months I noticed that my muscles had become smaller but still visible and I had gone from 6.1 to 5.8 which further confused me. I was to dumb then to notice the change in my family. My son had become taller and older looking my wife with more muscles and now face to face with me (she was formerly 5.6) and my daughter also growing slightly taller (was 5.4 before).”


“I had to buy new clothing and felt smaller and weaker and that only made my abuse worst.. but I didn’t effect my family as much at that point due to the changes which had gone unnoticed to them.. it was another 5 months until I was grasping what was going on and I was in pain. My bones had started cracking into the place of a 15 year old as I had now become 5.4 along with that I felt my organs shuffle around and a new one slowly form from out of no where. I had now fully lost my muscular body and now just looked like a skinny 15 year old boy with puberty hair..”


“My family and undergone drastic changes as well my wife now being 6.1 having a muscular frame and starting to grow body hair but still very woman looking in certain places. My son had grown and now looked 17 and started acting as arrogant and rude as I had been and my daughter had also grown to my wife’s former size along with her looking substantially different..”

“It was another 3 months when the pain in my bones and organs had stopped and started on my upper chest as I started growing C cups..and having my hair on my head begin to grow out along with my eyes becoming blue..”

“My wife now looked almost exactly like me and at this point I had that feeling to call her sir like I had forced my family to call me so long ago.. it had also seemed that my daughter was now acting as my mother but she was different looking it my former wife she looked more menacing and would often scold me. She had hit me the first time I had to switch rooms and sleep in my daughters room.. my son was now a 17 year old who relentlessly bullied me and made fun of me and my self esteem had crushed just like a 15 year old girl going through puberty would feel..”

“Another month is when I started going to school now looking like a 15 year old girl but at least school I was not bullied due to my apparent ‘beauty’ and instead I slowly felt myself becoming the bully..” 

“My family had now completely changed and I was now abused by my former wife and daughter and relentlessly tormented by my son..” it took another month when I felt the effect on my mind which had gone unnoticed over the last month as I felt myself becoming more like a dumb 15 year old bully who had low self esteem..”

“I began following the latest trends wearing the latest things and even used an iPhone for things other than calls..”

“And now it is Christmas and I am still tormented but luckily managed to secure this interview by a local news agency who apparently deals with things like this..”
I looked up from the paper I was reading I had written it so I wouldn’t go off topic and speak about makeup or something like that.. that is when I finally looked around and saw in the window watching over me the same old lady smiling a devilish smile at me..”

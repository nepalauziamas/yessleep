Naissance here. 

I had to leave— that’s what I told myself. I felt like that man was a threat. Not only was he threatening me, but also the recordings that we’ve explored together here, in these posts. I am now convinced that to destroy them before we reach the end would be a massive disservice, not only to all of you, but to finding the truth. I only hope that the man didn’t catch wind of my deception, and knew where I was heading. Who knows what this organization is capable of… 

I knew that Clara was hiding something when we first talked. The fact that she had been looking for a ‘gateway’ herself; all these years. The guilt she must feel for leaving her husband to die. It was all starting to make sense. I knew how she felt. Listening to all of these tapes— I wanted to go too. I wanted to go to *The Place*, even knowing the dangers. Just the mere existence of such a thing, it’s… *fascinating*.

I had to join her in her search. Of that I knew. 

I had a productive spurt as soon as I got to the motel. Therefore, two transcripts today. It finally feels as though everything is coming together.

**TAPE 4A: ‘CONCRETE’**

DATED: NOVEMBER 22ND, 2000

___

**\[START\]**

\[HEAVY RAIN\]

\[KNOCKING\]

NGUYEN: NYPD!

\[KNOCKING\]

NGUYEN: NYPD! Is anyone there?

DOBERMAN: No dice. 

NGUYEN: \[SIGH\] Fucking department. How are we supposed to make any kind of break in this case if we can’t take any initiative?

DOBERMAN: Rules are rules, Detective Nguyen. We’d ruin the case in court. 

\[HEAVY POUNDING\]

NGUYEN: NYPD! Open up! Don’t make us take this door down!

DOBERMAN: Nguyen!

NGUYEN: These people are possibly alive, Doberman. We don’t have time to wait for a warrant. It’s been far too long already. Getting them out should be our number one priority.

DOBERMAN: How are you sure it’s here?

NGUYEN: Look at this place. A door tucked in a maze of alleyways and corridors; hidden in the most populous city in the States. All of the missing persons were last seen in this area. When we got that anonymous tip— we had to check it out.

DOBERMAN: But how do you *know*?

NGUYEN: Listen, Doberman. I’ve worked on some of the most horrifying and heinous cases for the last thirteen years. Serial murders, torture. Kidnapping and abuse. The feeling I get from this door— it's the same feeling. Something is wrong here, Doberman.

DOBERMAN: Nguyen, you know that’s not good police work. We can’t operate off of a hunch.

NGUYEN: This is it, Doberman! I’m telling you!

DOBERMAN: That’s *not* enough, Nguyen!

NGUYEN: Fine. Suit yourself.

\[METAL CLICKING\]

DOBERMAN: So what, you’re gonna pick the lock? Great…

\[METAL CLINK\]

NGUYEN: There. Now are you coming or not?

DOBERMAN: \[SIGHS\] 

\[DOOR CREAKS\]

\[COUGHING\]

DOBERMAN: Jesus— that smell… 

NGUYEN: Fuck…

\[DOOR SHUTS\]

\[FLIES BUZZING\]

DOBERMAN: What could have done this?

NGUYEN: I don’t know.

DOBERMAN: What the hell…

NGUYEN: Come on, Doberman. Let’s do our job. 

\[ZIPPING, SNAP OF GLOVES\]

NGUYEN: Two deceased. Sitting up against the wall. Dismembered. One male, maybe in his forties. One female, also forties. A lot of heavy clothing, and layers. What, was there a storm recently? What do you think?

DOBERMAN: No idea. Decomp?

\[PAUSE\]

NGUYEN: Both In putrefaction; roughly 2-3 weeks old?

DOBERMAN: I’d say so. Blood has gone dry, stained the floor underneath them. This happened a while ago. 

NGUYEN: Multiple lacerations across the torso and head. Arms and legs missing. These wounds… It doesn’t look normal for dismemberment. Usually trauma like this can only be done with a sharp, heavy weapon, yet… 

DOBERMAN: The tears, in the skin and flesh. They were torn off. 

NGUYEN: What could do that?

DOBERMAN: No human I know. Especially through that thick clothing. Maybe a firearm? Point-blank shotgun shell?

NGUYEN: I don’t know. We’ll have to bring in a ballistics expert. Besides, there’s no shells, or bullet holes. 

DOBERMAN: Hm. 

\[PAUSE\]

NGUYEN: Doberman. Look around. Notice anything?

DOBERMAN: What?

NGUYEN: No blood. On the walls, or scattered around. It looks like it flowed right from the bodies to the front of that hatch at the end of the room. Don’t you think there would be more blood everywhere else if their wounds were so violent? 

DOBERMAN: Yeah, there should. Do you think they were killed elsewhere, and brought here?

NGUYEN: Maybe? No— they couldn’t have been. There’s no drag marks in the blood. It’s like they died here, and their blood was drained and flowed into that hatch.

DOBERMAN: What? That’s absurd. Where are the missing limbs, too?

NGUYEN: I don’t know. This isn’t an ordinary homicide. 

DOBERMAN: Well, shit. I’ll go call it in with the radio, Detective Nguyen. Then we can investigate that hatch. 

NGUYEN: Alright, I’ll finish some things up here. 

\[DOOR OPENS, SHUTS\]

\[SHUFFLING\]

NGUYEN: Hm?

\[PATTING\]

NGUYEN: A cassette tape recorder? Interesting. What were you doing with this?

\[FAINT, INHUMAN SCREECHING\]

NGUYEN: Huh?

\[DOOR OPENS, SHUTS\]

DOBERMAN: Detective Nguyen? Are you alright?

NGUYEN: Uh, yeah. I’m alright. 

DOBERMAN: We’ve got a couple of squad cars on the way to help us clear the building and check that hatch. Whoever did this could still be here. Though, with how old these bodies are, I doubt it. 

NGUYEN: Y-yeah, alright. Let’s wait for them in the car. I’m getting sick here. 

DOBERMAN: Uh, sure. 

NGUYEN: Why don’t we let the officers take this one? We can come back after they’ve given the all-clear.

DOBERMAN: Are you sure? Don’t you usually like taking point on these things?

NGUYEN: Not this time, Doberman. Let’s let these guys earn their paychecks.

After transcribing 4A, I took a little break. I ordered delivery, which was maybe a mistake. It only fueled my paranoia. I imagined that men in black masquerading as my delivery driver would knock on the door of my motel room, taking advantage of my hunger to apprehend me, and to confiscate the tapes. I was so in my head that when there *was* a knock on my door, probably my food, I didn’t answer. I sneakily looked through the blinds to see a young teenager, probably no older than 18, impatiently waiting with a box of pizza in his hands. They would have to try harder than that. 

Through the window, I noticed the swirling sky had a red hue to it. Red and orange. Not like a setting sun, but like guts and viscera. It was blurry, like a dream, its vastness attempting to consume me. I paid it no mind. The line between my visions and reality had already begun to blend to the point that it was now inconsequential.

I took a long shower to decompress and collect my thoughts. What was my plan? I was sure that I wanted to confront Clara again. I knew what she was looking for, and I wanted to look for it too. I had to see it for myself. I wanted to know what awaited me in *The Place*.

After my shower, I stared at myself in the mirror, remembering what had happened the last time I stared back at my reflection. I expected something to happen. My flesh being torn apart, or a twisted, malformed Jeffrey Stevens smiling back at me. Bloody hands coming out, and pulling me inside. But no such thing occurred. The thing is— part of me wanted it to. Everything that place had shown me, all I knew. I wanted more. I wanted it to show me more. In a fit of anger, I slammed my fists into the mirror, shattering it into bits of sharp broken glass. I pulled my hands back quickly, a large, red gash now present on my left hand. It hurt like hell, but I just sat there, and stared at it. Into the flowing, crimson gorge I had just created. Walls of flesh on either side, flooded with dark red blood. It was like I was in a trance. I gazed into myself, seeing the inner workings of *The Place*. It was here all along, borne of wound. Our bodies were made of that scarlet abyss.

**TAPE 4B: ‘WHITEOUT’**

DATED: MAY 25TH, 2012 

___

**\[START\]**

ROSS: May 25th, 2012. 11:32 AM. Log #1. This is Ida Ross, former climatologist at \[STATIC\]. Next to me is Howard Graham, geologist and atmospheric physicist. In the time since \[STATIC\] went defunct, we have continued our work.

GRAHAM: Right now, we are at an old satellite of \[STATIC\], called Lambda base. The initial goal of Lambda base was to find a ‘gateway’, a… portal, if you will, in Eastern Antarctica. Our job was to try to understand the physiology and inner workings of the place beyond that portal. Eventually, the main purpose of \[STATIC\] changed to sealing the gateways. The place they lead to, they called it…

ROSS: *Cruentum Altarae*. The bloody altar. 

GRAHAM: Yes. The problem is, Lambda never found the gateway in Antarctica. Long after \[STATIC\] fell apart, the location of the gateway was never revealed. But now—

ROSS: Now we have a lead. An S.O.S. signal was intercepted by one of our associates. A research team, unrelated to us, has gone missing near the Amery Ice Shelf, easternmost Antarctica. The signal was soon followed by a rescue attempt, yet the research team was nowhere to be found. This sort of thing isn’t uncommon, but considering it is in the region we were looking at all those years ago…

GRAHAM: There is a chance.

ROSS: Yes, there is a chance. 

GRAHAM: To finally see it, with our own eyes. 

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

\[WIND HOWLING\]

ROSS: May 31st, 2012. 2:47 PM. Log #2. We are roughly twelve kilometers from the reported location of the S.O.S. signal. A sudden blizzard forced us to take shelter in a small inlet at the bottom of a shallow crevasse. This is where we chose to set up camp for the night. We are relatively safe from the elements here, but our small team could only pack so many supplies. Hopefully, we are not stuck here for more than a couple of days. 

\[MAN GROANING\]

ROSS: That… is one of our team members. He broke his leg coming down into the crevasse. Treating it in these extreme conditions has been challenging.

\[SNOW SHUFFLING\]

GRAHAM: Ida, \[UNINTELLIGIBLE\]— his temperature is dropping. We need blankets, clothes— anything you can spare.

ROSS: Here.

\[ZIPPING\]

ROSS: Take this. Make sure the others don’t turn on the stove. The ceiling will melt. 

GRAHAM: Of course, thank you Ida. 

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

\[STRONG WIND HOWLING\]

ROSS: June 1st, 2012, 8:40 AM. Log #3. It’s the morning of the next day, and the blizzard is still raging outside. It’s gotten worse. Complete whiteout. You cannot see further than an extended hand. The most we can do, at this point, is ration our supplies and wait. A few members of our team, including Howard, opted to check the crevasse for the gateway. It turns out to be much larger than we initially thought. A crescent slice in a snowy wasteland. Roughly two kilometers lengthwise. I can feel that place calling to me. It’s close, of that I know. It’s a large distance to cover, and there are plenty of places to hide an entrance to *Cruentum Altarae.* Only time will tell. 

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

ROSS: June 1st, 2012, 10:12 AM. Log #4. Howard’s team just got back about 10 minutes ago in a panic. One of the members of our team, David Schuertz, was bleeding profusely from a wound on his abdomen. A trail of frozen blood dotted the snow from where they came from. He had tripped, and fell on jagged ice. That makes two injured so far. This was going to make the expedition more difficult than we could have imagined, and we haven’t even found the gateway yet. Things are beginning to look grim; but I know, sometime soon, we will find—

GRAHAM: Ida? May I speak with you?

ROSS: Yes?

GRAHAM: Schuertz is stable. Our medic was able to stop the bleeding. The thing is— well, it’s the behavior of his blood.  

ROSS: The behavior?

GRAHAM: The blood; the moment it touched the ground, it should have frozen. The temperature is well below freezing, after all— but it didn’t. It stained the snow, then a thin stream of red flowed deeper into the crevasse. It was feeding, Ida. *Cruentum Altarae*. 

\[PAUSE\]

ROSS: Do we tell the others?

GRAHAM: Morale is low. We have injured. I say we take a look, just us, during the night. We’ve been waiting for this, Ida. This is our moment. We can see this place for ourselves. What do you think?

ROSS: I think that’s an excellent idea, Howard.

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

ROSS: June 1st, 2012, 11:32 PM. Log #5. An altar of blood. A system of caverns, inherently illogical, bending space and time. The existence of this place holds incredible scientific value; yet, what draws me to it is something more akin to… *fascination*. For what value does science have, if not to push human understanding of the illogical, the unknown; no matter the peril. \[STATIC\] was afraid. It led to its failure. Howard and I have found what we think is the threshold between our reality and that place. We will see. Soon. 

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

ROSS: Log #6. Lining the walls is the crimson, bulbous flesh of *Cruentum Altarae*. The metallic taste of blood reaches us with every breath. It would be an understatement to say Howard and I are excited. We are euphoric. To study this place’s inner workings; it’s *anatomy*. That’s what we are here for. I know it. *It* knows it too. It wants us here. We haven’t explored much yet, as we are still near where the gateway was. Yet; we have learned so much. So, so much. 

GRAHAM: Ida!

ROSS: Howard? What is it?

GRAHAM: I heard something— men yelling. Screaming.

ROSS: Men yelling?

GRAHAM: I— I don’t know! But they are threats to us, to this place. I know it! We need to try to stop them, we need to continue. I feel this place pulling me deeper in. We can all be here together. We’re a part of this place now, Ida. 

ROSS: We always have been. Come, the altar is beckoning us further. 

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

ROSS: Log #7. It’s been weeks, months— perhaps. We have walked down this corridor of tissue and muscle for ages. There have been no forks in our path. Just one bloody path forward. We feel no fatigue, or hunger. Howard and I believe the altar is sustaining us. Further proof that we are in its favor. What it wishes to show us, I do not yet know. All I know is that Howard and I are prepared to walk for all of eternity to see.  

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

\[FAINT SOBBING\]

ROSS: Log #8. It was beautiful. A gargantuan pit of blood. A sanctuary of carmine; as we felt a tremendous urge to dive into the center, to sink to the bottoms of that abyss, to become one with *Cruentum Altarae*— but that was not our purpose. Our purpose was to witness. Suddenly, we saw a woman, shrouded in darkness, afloat in the middle of a pool of crimson. She looked at peace. Then, this woman sank. Slowly. Until her entirety was obscured in red. And so, we are left to wonder. Wonder what to do next.

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

\[FAINT SCREECHING\]

ROSS: Go, go Howard!

GRAHAM: B-but, our research!

ROSS: No, no! Run! We must escape with our lives!

\[HEAVY BREATHING\]

ROSS: I don’t know what happened since we have gotten to this place— It was like a trance. I just suddenly… snapped out of it. As soon as it was done with us. As soon as we did what we were meant to do.

\[SCREECHING GROWS LOUDER\]

ROSS: Keep moving Howard! Come on! 

GRAHAM: I’m trying!

ROSS: This place has warped since; protruding arms and legs litter the walls and ceiling— shattered bone and *faces*, god, the faces. 

\[PANTING\]

ROSS: We… are to be a part of this place now. It’s going to take us. I know it is. So we have to leave—

GRAHAM: Ida! Look, there! It’s… a ladder?

ROSS: A ladder? But how?

\[SCREECHING\]

ROSS: No time to think about it; come on!

\[METAL CLANGS\]

\[HATCH OPENS, SHUTS\]

GRAHAM: Where are we, Ida? Are we back?

ROSS: No way to be sure. It’s just an empty room.

\[HANDLE TURNING\]

ROSS: Locked. Is there any other way?

GRAHAM: I don’t see one. Concrete on all sides, except for that door. 

\[LOUD SCREECHING\]

\[BANGING\]

ROSS: Help! Is there anyone out there?

\[BANGING, SCRATCHING\]

GRAHAM: Ida, it— it’s here. The hatch isn’t going to hold. Is this— are we going to die? After everything?

ROSS: Howard, I—

\[PAUSE\]

ROSS: I’m sorry.

\[METALLIC CLICK\]

I can feel my mind in shambles. My thoughts are shrouded by red mist, conflicting memories and experiences constantly warping my reality. Could I trust myself? Could I trust these memories; these thoughts, as my own anymore? How could I know… How can I?

I’ve listened to these tapes before. I’ve told you all as much. My initial transcripts were corrupted in the university’s database. The revelations of them all; I’ve known them since the start. And yet… Why is my memory so fickle? How could I have forgotten in my earlier posts? I’ve known all of the answers from the start, and I’m just now realizing it. *The Place*… could it have been manipulating me this entire time? God, my head hurts like hell…

The final tape, 1C, is untitled. I swear before it had no date; but now I see that it does. Curiously, perhaps impossibly, it is dated September 29th, 2022. A few days ago. This revelation fills me with dread— perhaps someone had put a date on it behind my back? Or maybe… I did it, with no recollection of doing so? Either possibility is worrying, to say the least. 

I had hoped to transcribe the final tape before I met with Clara. However— the tape is, well, blank. Nothing but static. For the whole runtime. Knowing, however, how fickle these tapes can be… I’m almost positive it won’t stay that way. The further along I get into these tapes, the more I feel I’m losing myself. The more I want to journey into *The Place*. 

The tape would have to wait. Wait until after Clara. Though, I wasn’t even entirely sure there would *be* an after Clara. The possibility that my next post could be my last weighed on me greatly…

But I needed to set aside my paranoia for now. I attempted to steel myself by taking a breather outside my motel room. I stared at a now blood red sky, shifting and toiling, like pulsing intestines. The metallic taste of blood hit my mouth, wafting in from a light breeze. Clouds tinted crimson were like eyes. Watching. Observing. Judging. 

I thought about what Ida Ross had said her employers called *The Place.* The bloody altar. 

If *The Place* was an altar borne of blood; then we, of this world, were the sacrifice.

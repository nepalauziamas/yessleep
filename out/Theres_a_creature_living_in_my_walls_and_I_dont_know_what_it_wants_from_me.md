I need some help. This new house I'm living in has some serious problems... 

We moved in a year ago. A month after Mom died. Just me and Dad and Piper and an old, salt-encrusted Victorian with big dormer windows and a swooping front porch. It’s not much to look at, really. A faded-blue clapboard construction fronted by a piss-yellow lawn and a view of the Safeway parking lot across the street. Not exactly what I expected when Dad told me we were moving to the coast. He said he had to get away from her—or from the memory of her, anyway. Some bullshit line about missing her too much. 

*Nick, she haunts me. Every night, I can feel her in the room haunting me. It’s not good for me here no more. Or for you and your sister. We need a fresh start somewhere else.* 

But I knew it wasn’t a fresh start he needed. No, he wanted to run. I could see it in his nervous, washed-out eyes darting this way and that every time we went to the store, looking for the *I know what you did* looks. The tight smiles and curt nods in between all the poisoned glances. And at home, the trash cans boiling over with empty vodka bottles and crumpled cartons of Camel Lights, the floors ashed in dust. No one to clean them up anymore.

So, one day in late October, he pulled up in front of my school with a U-Haul tacked to the back of our rusted-out ’98 Chevy Silverado, and we left. No warning. No time for goodbyes. Just a quick, “Get in, kid. I found us a place up the coast. A place we can get right again.”

Piper cried the entire way. And me, well, I just bit my tongue.

The fear always starts in my toes when he speaks. A sinister prickle that blooms through my feet and spreads up my legs like a swarm of hatchling spiders in search of a meal. Some writhing, webbed-over treat to devour.

*“I can helps you. I can makes it all go away.”*

The Wallpaper Man’s voice is brittle, fluttering through the air of my room like a wisp of acrid smoke. 

*“Will it gives it to me? Will it gives me the pain?”*

I shudder in my bed and pull the sheets higher, close my eyes, and hope to snuff it out, to drown it in the black void of my dreams—anything to make it stop, to make it go away. 

Sometimes, when I’m feeling brave, I try to tune him out. I think about things like Piper’s smile when I tell her one of my stupid knock-knock jokes. I love her smile. It’s crooked-perfect just like Mom’s was. I think about her, too. About her lavender perfume and how soft she felt when she hugged me. I miss those hugs. A *lot*. 

When those things don’t work, when I’m too afraid to think about anything else, I focus on the fear. 

The color of it…black. *Definitely* black. 

Its consistency…thick, like tree sap. 

The taste…a bitter copper like when I bite my lip—like how I imagine battery acid would taste.

But it doesn’t work. Nothing does. The Wallpaper Man is used to kids who can get out of bed. Kids who can run. Me, I have no use for legs. The ALS took them six months ago.

Most people are nice enough when they see me. I mean, sure, they stare a little too long and nod a little too hard when they say hello. They’re quick to flash me a plastic smile and talk to me like I’m dumb or something. Like I’m a two-year-old, which I’m not. I’m sixteen. I just look young. 

Whatever. I can’t say I blame them. Who wants to spend time talking to death warmed over in a wheelchair? I sure as hell wouldn’t. I mean, I can’t bear to look at myself in the mirror. And why should I? I know how I look. The right side of my face droops like a stroke victim’s, muscles frozen in place and not quite working right, with the other half scrunching tight like I just swallowed a mouthful of sour candy. My eyes are buried in sharp sockets, and my mouse-brown hair sprouts from my head in weird directions that don’t quite make sense no matter how hard I try to smooth it into place.

The worst part is the pain. It’s my entire existence. Cramps that go on forever. Muscle spasms and skin sores on my legs. Knees and elbows that lock up like rusty old latches.

Despite this, like I said, most people are nice.

Everyone except Roger Ellis.

I’m in the boys’ bathroom, changing my catheter before first period, when the door bangs open to a cloud of Polo Sport and a heavy set of footsteps. I know it’s him before he even speaks. 

“Hey! Look who we have here. It’s Nicky Twitch!”

*Twitch—because it’s what my body does.*

“Leave me alone, Roger,” I mutter. 

Before I have a chance to brace myself, he’s behind me—whipping my wheelchair around in a circle, whooping and sending the contents of my catheter bag all over my lap. The sharp smell of ammonia stings my nostrils as I swipe at my jeans with a nearby paper towel, hoping to mop it up before it soaks in. 

“Hey, don’t freak out, Twitch,” Roger says, rounding my wheelchair. “I’m just messing with you, man. Looks like someone needs to cheer…” The words trail off, the corners of his mouth tugging into an evil grin. “Oh, my God. Did you piss yourself? You *did*, *didn’t* you?” He barks out a laugh. “That’s *so* disgusting. Wait until everyone hears about this. Pissing your pants! What a baby.” He spouts a few more jags of laughter and stomps out of the bathroom. 

I watch him go, rage swamping my chest, my lungs. 

Roger has everything. 

Perfect bone structure. Broad shoulders. A strong jawline already sprouting stubble. Girls chasing him everywhere he goes. He even drives a red Dodge Charger, one his lawyer father bought him the day he turned sixteen.

It’s not fair.

He’s everything I want to be, and everything I hate.

A ray of moonlight cuts through the blinds and washes over the wallpaper of my room. It’s awful stuff: toy bears marching with trumpets, leading a troupe of stuffed animals through a candy-cane forest. Rabbits and deer and bug-eyed badgers following behind in a drunken zig-zag line, each wielding an instrument of their own. Rippling beneath it like he’s floating in a pool of oil is the Wallpaper Man.

He has ten-inch serrated fingers that fall past a set of disjointed knees. His angular shoulder blades slope up into a razor-blade neck. His skull is long and segmented, punctuated by a jaw that curls inward, bones crackling when he speaks. Ridged eye sockets bulge from either side of his head and shift when he moves. 

Four eyes in all. 

I wish I could see *all* of him. Somehow it’s worse being forced to picture the true horror that lies beneath the wallpaper. The slick rows of teeth that sometimes flicker against it when he speaks. The skin I imagine to be thick and black and reptilian. 

“Has it brought me a name? Has it brought me the first of three?” His putrid breath seeps through the wallpaper, foul exhalations awaiting my response. “Gives me three names, and I will takes the pain, yesh?”

Night after night, it’s the same question: *Will I give him his gifts? Will I give him his three names?* And night after night, I croak out a wet-gurgled *no*, my voice nothing more than a splash of baby vomit. I don’t know what will happen if I give him a name. I don’t want him to hurt anyone. But tonight, something’s different. 

Tonight, something cold boils through my blood at the prospect of having to face another day with Roger Ellis in it. Without thinking, I whisper his name.

\#

I expect to see Roger slouched low at his desk the next morning, but it sits wonderfully empty. The sight fills me with relief. For the first time in a very long time, I can breathe. No looking over my shoulder, at least for today. 

And it only gets better. He doesn’t come to school the next day. Or the next. 

It isn’t until Friday that I start to worry. 

Is he *dead*? Surely not, right? I didn’t want to kill him, only hurt him a little…make him pay for everything he’s done to me. Make him feel, I don’t know, as worthless as I feel sometimes.

He comes to school on Monday and sits with his head cupped in his hands. He doesn’t bother to look up when I enter class, a thick swoop of sweat-drenched hair obscuring his eyes. His foot taps out an irregular beat on the floor—a frantic *tap! tap! tap!*—that sends me rolling to my desk a little faster. As I glide past him, a burst of air pushes through his lips. It’s laced with a familiar odor that tickles my nose. 

The sticky tack of glue fumes.

I watch him throughout the entire class. There’s something off about the way he sits, hunched forward like an eighty-year-old suffering from a lifetime of poor posture. His skin has taken on a strange chalky texture; it looks like drywall, like it would crumble beneath my fingertips if touched. 

Halfway through class, he turns, his gaze locking with mine until I look away. For some reason, I expected to see anger in his eyes, for him to know this was my fault, that I did this to him. But what I saw staring back at me just now wasn’t anger*.* 

It was fear.

A lake of it.

Cold. Clear. Fear.

After the last period bell rings, I roll outside to the curb and wait for Dad to pick me up. It’s frigid out. I shiver in my windbreaker and wonder how late he’ll be today. Yesterday, it was half an hour. The day before, forty-five minutes and he was reeking of booze. If he’s that late today, I’m pretty sure I’ll freeze.

A shrill whine snaps me out of the thought. An ambulance. Distant, but coming closer. Then, behind me, I hear the cry. *Roger’s* cry. It’s pain-drenched and terrified. He’s screaming like he’s burning alive. I turn and spot him stumbling across the cement with two of his jock friends, his hands flapping like a pair of panicked birds, spraying watery-pink fluid everywhere. He collapses in front of me, a few feet away, and—*Oh, God—*his skin…

It’s *gone*. 

*All of it.* 

In its place are pale bands of fibrous red muscle entwined with tangled nerve endings. Strips of bone peek through the pink tissue. And there’s something else. Sticky white clumps of what look to be paste are speckled all over his ruined palms, coating his naked digits, running up to his forearms where the skin is peeling back in tattered strips.

I choke back a slug of bile.

The gym teacher, Mr. Johnson, abandons his post directing traffic and sprints over. “Jesus! What the hell happened here?”

One of Roger’s friends, I think his name is Ethan, looks up wild-eyed, panicked. “It-it just—” He glances away and shakes his head. His eyes are wet. “His skin just came off, Mr. Johnson. Like a pair of gloves! We were playing catch, and Roger started screaming when he caught the football. We don’t know what happened.”

But I do. 

I did this to him. *I* made this happen.

Roger unleashes a painful howl that slices through my ribcage all the way to my heart.

A moment later, the ambulance tears up to the curb, and I watch EMTs load Roger onto a stretcher, his eyes wild with pain, rotating in their sockets like dirty brown marbles as they wheel him away.

\#

That night, my eyelids scrape open to sheer darkness. A tomb. I can’t see the streetlight through my blinds, can’t locate the reassuring red glow of my alarm clock on the dresser. My torso is slicked with sweat. I can’t stop thinking about Roger’s skin, about the way it peeled off his arms like paint left too long in the sun. The way it… 

A chill washes down my arms, my legs. 

Someone’s watching me. 

No, not some*one.*

*Him.*

He'll want another name...and I don't know what to do.

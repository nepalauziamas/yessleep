It was Halloween night. I was hanging out with my friends as I usually did each year. At this point we were all around 18 years old and decided that we wanted to trick or treat still. 

We watched horror movies until about 7:00 PM then decided to go out and start getting candy before everyone was done. I was with my friends Jen and Marcus. We got dressed in what we could find to make costumes of and went out.

We got a pretty good haul that night too. Lots of candy but we travelled a bit far away from my house.

“I think we should start heading back” Marcus said. 

I agreed since it was already 8:30 and basically dark. Everyone else outside  had gone home for the night so we were the only ones on the street. As we were walking home, I spotted this road that it’d never seen before. As many times as I’d been in the area, I never saw this road. I halted to a stop and suggested we go down it.

“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Said Jen. “You have no clue what’s down that road.”

I looked at her for a minute then gave her a smirk. “What’s the worst that could happen?” I remarked.

Jen sighed but her and marcus followed me down the road. As we ventured down, we can across a huge house. The mailbox at the front read “166 Rosemary Drive”. 

Marcus yelled with excitement, “ It’s a big house! That means they have the king size candy bars!”

Jen looked at him and said,” Uh, no. It’s almost 9:00 at night, you think people are still giving out candy?”

Marcus and I replied,” Only one way to find out.” 

Jen followed Marcus and I up to the front door. I went to knock but then Jen stopped me. 

“Look!” She said, pointing to a “Do Not Enter” and “Beware” sign 

Her and I exchanged looks but before we could turn to leave, Marcus knocked on the door. We looked at him with horrified faces. Before we could say anything the door opened but nobody was standing there. 

“Hello?” We all exclaimed.

Nobody answered. Marcus started walking right in so we ran after him into the house. The door slammed shut behind us. I went to go open it but it wouldn’t budge. Jen started panicking.

“What are we gonna do? We’re trapped!” She yelled

“Don’t worry, we’ll find another exit.” I said trying to calm her down.

We continued through the house looking at everything we passed. The was some antique furniture and old pictures. After walking through the house we found some stairs

“What is that?” Said Marcus

“What we you talking about?” I asked

“That thing at the top of the stairs.”

I looked up and all I saw was a shady figure. I was in shock because I couldn’t tell if my mind was messing with me or if the thing was real.

“Are you the owner?” Asked Marcus.
The figure kind of just stood there and didn’t say anything. “Sorry for coming into your home, the door opened and we walked in.”

The person started walking down the stairs. He stopped at about half way down. You could see him clearly now. The person that walked down the stairs was a Middle Aged man. He was wearing a mask so I just assumed maybe he was getting into the Halloween spirit. I gulped and looked at Jen and Marcus. 

“I think we should find the exit and leave. Now!” I said demandingly. As we backed away the man took more steps down the stairs. “RUN!” I screamed. Jen and I booked it back towards the entrance. Marcus was kind of just frozen in fear but he wasn’t moving.

 “Let’s go Marcus!” Yelled Jen. He wasn’t moving. Before we knew it, the man was at the bottom of the steps standing right in front of Marcus. The man put both his hands on Marcus’ face and stood there for a moment. Jen and I looked on confused. In the span of less than a second, Marcus’ head did a full 180 degree turn.

 “WHAT THE HELL!?” I yelled. Jen let out a shriek of grief and fear. Marcus’ limo body fell to the floor. The man took another step towards us. “Shit, Shit, Shit… RUN JEN!” 

Jen and I booked to the entrance and the door flew open. We ran out out of that house faster than either of us had ever ran before. We kept running until we got back to my house and were in my living room. 

“What are we gonna do?” I said 
“Call the police!” Yelled Jen. 
“They won’t believe us!” 
“We’ll we have to do something!”

Jen and I decided the best thing to do was call the police and report Marcus missing. We dialed 911 and they came out to my house. When they got here, they asked us to show them where we last were with Marcus and what time. We told them about the address “166 Rosemary Drive” and that we were with him around 9:00. They left the house and came back around 20 minutes later. 

“ We went and checked out the address you gave us, but there was nothing there because the address you gave us isn’t real. Are you sure that was the address you saw?” 

“Yes!” We exclaimed. “We can take you to it.”
The police drove us out to where we told them we saw the road at. We got out of the car and there was no road. No mailbox. No house. 

“It was right here!” I said 

The officers looked at me and then back at each other. 

“You know that wasting our time with a fake case can get you fined right?” 

I looked at them in awe. “We’re not faking this. Our friend is seriously missing and he could be dead.”

“Get back in the car.” The officers said. 

They dropped Jen and I off at my house, then drove off. They didn’t believe us that Marcus was missing. They thought we were pranking them. I’m 25 years old now and every Halloween, Jen and I go back to the same spot around the same time, to see if “166 Rosemary Drive” will ever return.

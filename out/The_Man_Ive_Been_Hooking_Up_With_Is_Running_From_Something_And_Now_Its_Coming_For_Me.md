If you’ve ever been a young man in his early twenties, then you’ll know that it’s an understatement when I say that we’re always horny.

&#x200B;

In fact, I’m pretty sure it’s been scientifically proven. I read somewhere that they did a study and confirmed that men’s sex drive is at its highest in their twenties and being a 22 year old man, with a lot of male friends around my age, I can confirm that this is true. Most of my friends won’t stop talking about the girls they’ve met, or who they’ve hooked up with.

&#x200B;

My one roommate, Zach seems to bring home a different girl every weekend, and while my other roommate Renard isn’t quite as much of a casanova, the amount of guys and girls who obviously have a thing for him is nothing short of biblical. (People just seem to have a thing for spooky witchy goth boys.) It honestly all made me a little jealous. Not that they were hooking up with girls, I’m gay as hell, but the fact that they were getting any action at all.

&#x200B;

I guess I couldn’t complain too much… I mean, meeting guys usually involves going out and actually meeting them. I’ve always been more of a quiet, introverted type, so I’m not exactly Mr. Social. But that doesn’t change the fact that I’ve got needs too. I guess I saw it as a little bit pathetic… I mean, here I was in what was supposed to be the golden years of my youth. I was in University in a town that was supposed to have a thriving gay community. I was supposed to be out partying, drinking, meeting new people and getting laid, right? Instead I just sorta hung out in my dorm, played the sims and jerked off while thinking about how much I needed a real man.

&#x200B;

My friends invited me out every now and then but I never really wanted to go. They were either going to the bar to drink and party, which wasn’t exactly my scene, or to some social meetup that I’d just feel out of place in. So I'd just stayed home.

&#x200B;

I’d downloaded Grindr a few times, but chickened out whenever I started really talking to anyone. Instead I just sorta wallowed in my own self consciousness and pent up sexual frustration while I fantasized about a charming, older man (thirty, forty at most) who’d come in, sweep me off my feet, take me back to his house and then ***fucking give it to me raw***. 

&#x200B;

Then I met Vince.

&#x200B;

I’d first started messaging Vince during one of the cyclical phases where I’d worked up the nerve to download Grindr again. Unlike some of the degenerates on that hell app (seriously, every straight man needs to use Grindr. The scumbags on there will teach you how to talk to girls by demonstrating everything *not* to do.) Vince was soft spoken and friendly.

&#x200B;

The pictures he posted depicted a well built man in his late twenties with a bald head and kind eyes. He had a soft, sort of boyish smile that it was kind of hard not to like. He wasn’t pushy like some of the guys on that app. He just seemed to want to talk and see where it led. I liked that about him.

&#x200B;

He told me that he was from out of town, and he’d moved here temporarily to work at the local quarry. He was renting a small townhouse downtown but he wasn’t sure if he was going to stick around when the lease was up in a few months. I’d sent him a few (tasteful) pictures of myself and he’d told me I looked cute.

&#x200B;

Then after about a week of texting back and forth, he’d asked if I wanted to meet up for ‘coffee’. That was it.

&#x200B;

When he’d asked, I’d closed the app on my phone and just stepped back. Every fiber of my being wanted to say yes. A thousand times yes. I wanted to have my first ‘coffee’ with Vince. But there was also that little nagging voice in the back of my mind…

*‘What if he’s a serial killer? What if he’s just luring you in, and nobody ever sees you again? What if he turns out to be a really fucked up person? What if he doesn’t like you when you meet in person?’*

&#x200B;

There were a million little things that could go wrong! But I still *wanted it*… And Vince was different than the usual guys I talked to on that app. Meeting up with him felt less… Impulsive.

&#x200B;

I let his message sit for about half an hour, during which I almost deleted Grindr again twice… But eventually, I decided that if I wanted to get laid, sooner or later I’d need to actually meet up with a guy. So I asked him where he wanted to meet.

&#x200B;

As I got ready to meet Vince for the first time, my nerves were getting the better of me. I’d deliberated over the outfit I’d wear, going between something casual and something more formal. Did it even matter? It was probably coming off anyways! I slipped some condoms into my wallet in case he didn’t have any, and took a long shower to make myself as clean as humanly possible.

&#x200B;

As I dried off my hair and smoothed it down, I heard a chime from my phone and a message popped up on the screen.

&#x200B;

*‘See you in 5 :)’*

&#x200B;

Fuck… He was almost there… We’d agreed to meet by the University coffee shop, literally across the street from my dorm. He was going to pick me up, and we’d head back to his place and then… Oh God…

&#x200B;

My legs were literally shaking with anticipation. My heart was racing. I was half tempted to cancel because I just felt like such a mess… But I didn’t want to disappoint him. What if I didn’t get another chance! I took a deep breath and looked at myself in the mirror. God suddenly I hated everything about my face… I wanted to change my clothes again, but time was running out.

&#x200B;

In all things, there eventually comes a point where you just kinda say *‘fuck it, good enough’* and move on. I forced myself to do just that. I made sure I had everything I needed before heading downstairs and onto the street.

&#x200B;

My timing couldn’t have been better. I could see a black RAM truck pulling up in front of the coffee shop. The window was down and in the drivers seat, I could see Vince. He parked the truck, wearing a black shirt and sunglasses. He sat for a moment, checking his phone before looking around. It was now or never…

&#x200B;

Slowly, I stepped toward his truck and raised a hand to wave at him. The moment he saw me, he waved back. I saw his smiling at me and my heart fluttered a little bit. This was it.

&#x200B;

I rounded the truck and got into the passenger seat, smiling anxiously at him as I did.

“Hey.”

“Hey.” He replied. Seeing him up close, his smile was almost as nervous as mine was… Honestly it was kinda cute and soothed my nerves a little.

&#x200B;

“So… How’s your day going?” I asked, scrambling to make small talk. He just laughed.

“Not bad, not bad at all.” He said, “Did you want to stop for a coffee first or head out?”

“I’m good with heading out.” I said, forcing a smile.

“Alright then.”

He shifted the truck into gear and pulled out. We were off to his place.

&#x200B;

For a moment, neither of us spoke. We sat in awkward silence without knowing what to say. There was an anxious throb in my chest, and the longer we sat, the more that throb intensified.

“So… You go to the University?” He asked.

“Yeah, I’m in the business management course.”

“Really? How’s that treating you?”

“It’s alright. It can be boring but, I figure I’m setting myself up for a good career, you know?”

“Yeah. I do… Always wished I had the money to go back to school. I kinda just ended up where I am now. Not saying it’s that bad or anything but… Well… I guess everyone dwells on the past.”

&#x200B;

“I mean, it’s never too late.” I suggested, “I’ve got some people in my class who are starting a second career. It’s always there if you want it.”

“If I had the money, maybe.” He said, “Although I don’t even know what I’d go for… Never really had a lot of opportunities to think on the future. I kinda just move around.”

“That sounds like it would get lonely.” I said.

&#x200B;

He laughed.

“Yeah… A little…” He admitted, “It’s kinda why I started talking to people. Sorry… I’ve never really done this before. I don’t really know the drill.”

“It’s okay. It’s my first time too.” I assured him. He cracked a small smile at that.

“First time meeting up with someone through the app or first time…?”

“Both.” I admitted.

“Both… Well… Guess I’ve got to make it special for you, then.” He said.

&#x200B;

About a moment later, he rolled his truck into the parking lot of a small townhouse. He looked over at me and took his sunglasses off. He had a soft, almost anxious smile.

“Want to come inside?” He asked. I nodded slowly, then watched as Vince got out.

&#x200B;

On legs of jelly, I followed him into his house. My heart was fluttering at a million miles per minute. This didn’t even feel real. He opened the door for me and let me in, then locked it behind me.

“Can I get you anything?” He asked, “A drink or something…?”

“I’m good.” I said softly, “Just a little nervous, is all.”

“Don’t be.” He said, “We’ll take it slow. Go at your pace, okay?”

&#x200B;

I nodded, suddenly unable to speak as he approached me. I felt his arms wrapping around me as he placed a hand under my chin.

“Why don’t we start with this?” He asked, his voice little more than a sultry whisper… And then he was kissing me.  At first I was a little startled, but I leaned into it. This was the first time anyone had ever kissed me.

&#x200B;

I could hear the beating of my own heart in my ears as I melted into his embrace. Oh God, this was everything I’d wanted and then some. As our lips parted, he gently took me by the hand and led me to his living room. We sat down on his couch together and he kissed me again.

&#x200B;

We took it slow at first, a few gentle touches here and there, as we both warmed up to each other. The whole time, I couldn’t stop thinking about where this would end and that just made me squirm in anticipation. His breath was warm against my neck as he pressed kisses along my jawline. 

A few minutes of foreplay later, he led me up to his bedroom… Up until then, I’d been tempering my expectations in case this ended in disappointment. But while Vince was many things, a disappointment was not one of them.

&#x200B;

As we lay together afterward, tangled in the sheets with me having just become a man, I felt ready to doze off in his arms.

“So… Was that everything you were hoping for?” He asked me, planting a kiss on top of my head. I just nodded and groaned in satisfaction.

“Good…” he said softly, “Me too…”

“When can we do this again?” I asked, looking up at him.

“Hey, long as I’m not working, I’m game.” He said.

I pulled myself up to kiss him.

“I’ll hold you to that.” I said, and I meant it.

&#x200B;

Spending time with Vince became part of my schedule after that. I’d visit him in the evenings if I wasn’t too busy and sometimes I even stayed the night (Because let’s be honest, I wasn’t walking home after a night with him).

&#x200B;

Our little hookups made me feel… Complete. I never really thought that casual sex would do that, but it was just a little shot of dopamine to my brain every time he kissed me. I was happy when I was with him and for a while, I felt like nothing could go wrong!

&#x200B;

And it was at this point that things started to go wrong.

&#x200B;

It all came on so slowly. I don’t think I can remember the first sighting I had. I probably didn’t even know it was a sighting back then. It would just be there, somewhere in the background.

&#x200B;

The first sighting that I remember happened as I was leaving Vince’s one night. I wasn’t exactly fully alert since I was still a little out of it from the glorious fucking I’d just received, and I kept thinking back on, the little highlights of the night. Remembering the feeling of our bodies pressed so close together, and the way I’d wrapped my legs around him… The little breathy gasps he’d made as we’d cuddled together afterward… Oh yeah, I was feeling pretty contented.

&#x200B;

Normally Vince would’ve driven me back to my dorm, but his truck was in the shop. It really wasn’t that far of a walk, so I’d come over to keep him company for the night. I was sorta daydreaming about what had just happened as I walked home when I noticed it, a good several feet ahead of me. Something that kinda looked like a person, just standing there.

&#x200B;

I say ‘kinda’ looked like a person because… Well, it was difficult to really tell from a distance but there was just something off about them. At the time, it was difficult to put my finger on but looking back, I can pinpoint exactly what it was. They just sort of stood there in the distance, staring vacantly off into the distance. They weren’t even smoking or anything. They were just standing there, mostly in the dark so it was hard to get a good look at them, but the fact that they were so unnaturally still weirded me out a little. Tevam Sound’s a pretty safe town, but safe or not, anyone with a brain isn’t going to approach something that gives off a vibe that weird.

&#x200B;

I’d stared at them for a few moments before crossing the street to avoid them. I’d watched them out of the corner of my eye for a little bit as I passed, and once I was safely past them I looked back just in case. But they weren’t there anymore. Where they’d been just a few moments ago, there was just darkness.

&#x200B;

I didn’t stick around to investigate further.

&#x200B;

I saw them again a couple of days later, as I was leaving class. One of my classes runs fairly late, getting out around 9. It’s the one I hate the most, but it’s only for a semester, so it is what it is.

&#x200B;

I’d been walking back to my dorm with Renard and Zach. They’d been just a couple of feet ahead of me when I noticed someone standing in a parking lot across the street. The moment I saw him… I just sorta paused and stared.

&#x200B;

I’d passed that parking lot a thousand times before. It usually wasn’t that dark, although that night, most of the lights were out. There were only a couple of cars in there, and far behind any of them at the very edge of the light I could see the same figure I’d seen before.

&#x200B;

Not a similar figure. The exact same.

&#x200B;

His pose hadn’t even changed. He just stood there, arms hanging limp at his sides, stiff as a mannequin. I’d stared at him for a few moments, wondering just what the fuck I was seeing when Renard called out to me.

“Hey, Corey, you alright?”

&#x200B;

I looked at him, then back at the parking lot. The lights in there were on again. Nothing seemed out of place.

“Yeah… I’m fine.” I lied. But I kept watching the parking lot as we walked past.

&#x200B;

The night after that, Vince had dropped me off back at my dorm after another date. We’d been planning to go to the local boardwalk, but the storm that night had convinced us to stay inside and have hot gay sex instead. His truck had parked on the street out front of my dorm and I’d kissed him goodbye before getting out. As per usual, my heart was still fluttering a thousand miles per minute as I was coming down off the wonderful high of that evening. When I got up to my room, I couldn’t help but glance out the window dreamily and think about Vince.

&#x200B;

And what was there to tear me away from my fond recollections of cock? That same goddamn figure… The same one I’d seen twice by then, standing on the other side of the street outside my window. Silent and stiff. I stared at it for a few moments, and I could feel my stomach churning.

&#x200B;

I closed the curtains as if that might make it go away. But I don’t know if it did or not. The first time had been weird… The second time had been very weird. *This* was starting to scare me.

&#x200B;

It was gone the next morning when I woke up… But the fact that it had even been there in the first place was still weighing on my mind. I went to class as normal that day, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it…

&#x200B;

I couldn’t stop seeing it either.

&#x200B;

Maybe this was all in my head, but as I was heading to my first class, I could almost swear I saw that weird figure standing at the end of the hall, behind the throng of people. I only caught a glimpse of it… Enough to recognize it.

&#x200B;

The hall was better lit and this time, it was the people who kept me from seeing it clearly. But from what little I did see, I could almost swear that it was naked… And maybe it was just my imagination, but I thought for sure there was more to it than just the figure I saw…

&#x200B;

It was hard to describe but… From the glimpse I caught of it, it almost didn’t seem like one person standing there alone. I wondered if I was crazy for even thinking this, but it almost looked like something else was holding it out for display. Like a guy on a corner twirling a sign, to tell you about a nearby pizza place.

&#x200B;

When I tried to get a better look though, it was gone again. I thought I caught a few other glimpses of it throughout the day but I couldn’t be 100% sure about any of them… It could’ve just as easily been my nerves fucking with me.

&#x200B;

Vince and I had agreed to meet up after my last class got out, and sure enough his truck was waiting for me out front when I got out of school. I’d gotten into the passenger seat and he’d greeted me with a smile and a kiss.

&#x200B;

“Hey there, handsome, going my way?” He’d asked playfully.

I’d just forced a smile in response.

“Hey”

His brow immediately furrowed.

&#x200B;

“Bad day?” He asked, “Everything okay?”

“The day was… Fine, I guess…” I said, glancing out the window to make sure I didn’t see anything.

“Doesn’t sound okay.” Vince said, “I’m here to talk if you need me, you know.”

I’d looked over at him, thinking it over for a moment before I said anything.

“You’re going to think I’m crazy…”

&#x200B;

Dates aside, we’d never taken our relationship beyond just being fuckbuddies… Opening up to him about this didn’t exactly feel right, but that was probably my social anxiety talking. Vince looked genuinely concerned. I could see the way his shoulders tensed up. I couldn’t really imagine him not taking me seriously so… I told him. Or, I told him as much as I could without sounding like a raving lunatic.

“I think somebody’s been  following me.”

&#x200B;

The look that crossed Vince’s face was hard to describe, and it certainly wasn’t the one I’d expected. He almost looked as if I’d just told him I had terminal cancer.

“Did you get a look at them?” He asked, his voice low and shaky.

“Not really… They’re always far away. At night, they’re in the shadows. When I saw them today, they were always behind a crowd. It’s… it’s hard to describe. They just sort of stand there, though. They never move, it’s like-”

&#x200B;

“Like a mannequin…” He finished, “It looks like a person, but not really…”

The color had completely drained from his face. He was gripping the steering wheel with white knuckles now.

“You’ve seen them too?” I asked.

He hesitated for a moment, before slowly nodding.

“Yeah…” He finally said, “I’ve been seeing them for a while.”

&#x200B;

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath before shifting his truck into gear. Then he started to drive, glancing all around before he did.

“Wait, you’ve seen them before?” I asked, “Who the hell are they?”

“I… I don’t know…” He murmured, “I’ve just… I’ve been seeing them ever since Kirkland.”

“Kirkland?”

“A company I used to work at…” He said, then trailed off again. “Christ… Now *you’re* going to think *I’m* crazy…”

“Just tell me what’s going on! I promise, I won’t think you’re crazy!”

&#x200B;

He laughed. There was no humor in it. If anything he just sounded tired.

“No? Because honestly… I think I’m crazy. This whole thing, it’s… Sorry. I’m beating around the bush. I’ve never… I’ve never talked about this with anyone before… I’m not sure where to start.”

“You mentioned Kirkland.” I said, “Why don’t you start there?”

He exhaled and nodded, gathering himself for a few moments before he finally spoke.

&#x200B;

“Alright… About five, six years ago I was working with this company called Kirkland… We mostly did tunnel construction for subways and shit like that. The money was alright. I liked the guys there. I figured I could do alright if I stuck around. I guess you can see how that went… The last job I did with them… We were digging out some tunnels for a client. I forget what they were for… I don’t suppose it matters. Everything was going fine until we hit a cave system. You’d get those sometimes and when we did, we’d always have to stop to make sure we could keep digging without bringing the whole thing down on top of us.

&#x200B;

I’d been in working in the machine when it happened. We’d stopped and called in a couple of guys to go ahead and examine the cave, determine if it was safe to keep on digging and all that. About two hours after we’d hit the cave, they’d gone inside and they never came out again.”

“What do you mean they never came out again?” I asked.

&#x200B;

“Exactly that. They went into that cave. They didn’t come back out. A little while later, we started having issues with the tunnel boring machine. Power failures and such…  We tried to fix it, but the machine just… Something was fucking with it. And it wasn’t too long before we noticed that the longer we stuck around trying to fix it, the less of us there were. There were about 8 of us working at the time. After about 3 of us had gone missing within the span of a few hours, we figured something was up and decided to get the hell out of there. Of the 5 of us who tried to leave, only three of us actually got out… I don’t know what exactly happened to the others. I just know that something took them. Something in the tunnel.”

&#x200B;

He shook his head and sighed.

“As far as I know, nobody ever figured out exactly what happened. We all figured that there was something living in that cave we’d broken into, but none of us got a good look at what it was. We were too busy running for our lives. The project got shut down a little while after. One of the guys who’d gotten out with us quit and said he’d never go underground again. Couldn’t really blame him… Me and my one friend? We only stayed because we needed the money. I told myself that whatever it was we’d run into… Whatever had been in that cave, we weren’t going to ever see it again. I guess I was wrong… It took the guy who’d quit first. About a month after the incident, he just… He just vanished. Then me and my buddy started seeing things. A figure in the distance, always hidden by something. Eventually, I got spooked… I quit the job, got in my truck and started driving. That might’ve just been the smartest thing I ever did. A few days later, my buddy turned up missing…”

&#x200B;

He paused for a moment, and I could almost swear I saw him trying to fight back tears.

“I’ve been on the move ever since. I used to think I could just settle in somewhere but… Every time I get comfortable, I start seeing it again and once I start seeing it again, then I move.”

“Jesus Christ…” I said under my breath. If I hadn’t seen this thing for myself I probably would’ve thought Vince was crazy…

But all I could do now was listen in horror.

&#x200B;

“I thought… Christ… I thought I could at least be with somebody for a little while before I had to move on. That I could have something, even if it wasn’t going to last all that long…” His voice was shaking as he spoke, “But I guess I’ve just dragged you into this with me… Christ… I didn’t… I didn’t fucking want that… I didn’t think it would go after you too… I didn’t… Fuck… I’m sorry, Corey… I’m so fucking sorry.”

&#x200B;

Slowly, I reached out to put my hand on his leg.

“It wasn’t your fault…” I said quietly, although I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t outright terrified.

“Wasn’t it?” He asked, “I don’t know what it did to the other guys. But I’ve seen enough of it to… To have an idea, of what it does to them. If something happens to you, it’s my fault. If you get killed that’s *my* fault! I should’ve just… Goddamnit…”

&#x200B;

The truck veered to the side of the road and Vince pulled it into a park. He couldn’t hold back the tears anymore and they streamed down his cheeks as he broke down into heavy sobs.

“I was just so *fucking tired* of being alone… I just… I wanted to go on a fucking date!”

&#x200B;

I pulled him into a hug and he sank down onto my shoulder. Not going to lie, it was a little awkward hugging a crying man much larger than I was, but he needed it. For a few moments, I just let him cry as he apologized to me over and over again. And when he finally started to regain his composure, he just went silent as he gathered up his thoughts again.

&#x200B;

“I can take you back to your place…” He said, “I can help you pack whatever you need to run. If you want to go your own way, I completely understand.”

“Run?” I repeated, “Vince, I can’t just pack up and run! I’ve got school, I’ve got a life here, I’ve got plans!”

&#x200B;

“And that thing will kill you if you stay.” He replied, “I’ve been trying to figure out what it is for years. Trying to figure out if there’s some way to kill it… But I don’t know jack shit about this weird, supernatural stuff. So unless you know somebody who does…”

My eyes widened as a sudden wave of realization washed over me.

&#x200B;

“Wait, wait, wait… Vince. I think I *do* know somebody.”

He paused, staring back at me as if he couldn’t believe what he’d just heard.

“What?”

“Just take me back to the dorm. I don’t know anything about the supernatural, but think I know somebody who does!”

&#x200B;

Renard Kennedy and I went back a while. I knew him back before he’d transitioned and we’d stayed pretty good friends over the years, hence why we’d chosen to room together when he’d decided to start staying at the University.

&#x200B;

Renard had always been at least somewhat interested in the supernatural. When we were kids, he loved dragging me to horror movies that scared the shit out of me and spent most of our high school years writing self insert monster fanfiction (pretty sure that’s how he’d figured out he was trans.) So the fact that he’d gotten hard into the occult after moving out of his parents place wasn’t that surprising to me. Personally, I didn’t quite get his interest in it - But hey, if it made him happy, I supported it. If there was one person on earth I’d ask about the kind of shit that Vince had just described to me, it was Renard.

&#x200B;

I texted him as Vince and I drove back to the dorm to make sure he was there and asked if he could meet up with us. I specified that it was in fact an emergency. I believe my exact words were:

*‘We need a witchy goth boy.’*

&#x200B;

Sure enough, Renard texted back a couple of minutes later. He’d be waiting for us at the coffee shop across the street from our dorm.

&#x200B;

He’d ordered himself a hot tea and was waiting for it to be cool enough to drink when Vince and I showed up. He sat alone in one of the booths, a ghostly pale boy in a black leather jacket with a bleached white skater haircut. It was impossible to miss him.

&#x200B;

He looked up at us as we walked in and took a sip of his tea as we slid into the booth beside him.

“So…” He asked, calm as ever, “What’s the emergency?”

I looked at Vince and let him explain.

&#x200B;

He spoke softly and was calmer than he’d been when he’d explained it all to me, although I could feel him reaching for my hand under the table as he spoke. Renard just sat quietly the whole time, occasionally taking a sip of his tea. It was hard to tell just what he was thinking.

&#x200B;

“I know this all sounds crazy…” I said, as Vince finished speaking, “But I’ve seen it too. I don’t even know if there’s anything you can do to help us, but I literally do not know who else to talk to about this, and I don’t want to spend my life running from this thing and I don’t want to die!”

“Well, given the choice, people usually prefer life over death.” Renard replied. His eyes locked with mine for a moment before he finished off his tea.

&#x200B;

“Look… I’m going to be completely honest with you. I do know a little bit about this stuff, but I’m not entirely sure just how much I can help you. These kinds of things are complicated and from what I’ve read, stopping them is never exactly easy…”

“So you believe us?” I asked hopefully.

&#x200B;

“Yes. I believe you, and I’ve got a general idea as to what this thing is, as well as a few ideas on what you might be able to do. But honestly, you’d probably be better off in the hands of an actual expert.”

“Well I don’t suppose you’d know where we could find one, then?” Vince asked.

&#x200B;

“Yes and no…” Renard admitted, “When I started studying this stuff a couple of years ago, one of my friends pointed me in the direction of Dr. Vega here in town. Normally, I’d say she’s your best bet although right now, she’s out of town. I don’t think she’ll be back for a couple of weeks and I don’t know if you’ve got that long.”

&#x200B;

“Great…” Vince sighed, flopping back into his seat. “So we’ve got no choice but to run, then?”

“Not exactly.” Renard added, “Like I said… One of my friends pointed me in the direction of Dr. Vega. I don’t exactly have her experience but I’ve learned a lot from her. I’ll be honest, I’ve never actually done it before… But I’m familiar with some of the spells and rituals she uses to ward off things like this.”

“So you can help?” I asked hopefully, “We can just, pray to the Devil and it’ll go away, right?”

I was half joking when I said that, but Renard just frowned.

&#x200B;

“Not exactly…” He said, “Entities like the one I think is after you are a lot like animals. They’ll chase you so long as they think they can kill you, but if you can find a way to wound them, they’ll generally leave you alone. The trick of course is, finding a way to wound them. Conventional weapons usually won’t do the trick. But a ritual dagger would.”

&#x200B;

“A ritual dagger? And where exactly would we find that?”

“I’ve already got one.” Renard said, “When I started studying with Dr. Vega, she helped me scrimshaw one out of bone. She showed me what runes to carve into it… It should be enough to wound it. I’ve also got some ingredients back at the dorm that I can use to make a poison that can affect it.”

&#x200B;

“A poison?” Vince asked hopefully, “So we can kill it?”

“Probably not… I’m not sure if these kinds of things even can be killed by any normal means. But we can hurt it worse than it’s ever been hurt before.”

“That’s good enough for me.” Vince said, “Chances are that it’ll probably come for us after nightfall… Can you have it ready for then?”

Renard cracked a nervous smile.

“Why don’t we head back to the dorm and find out?”

&#x200B;

Watching Renard work was nothing short of surreal. I’d watched as he’d pulled a trunk out from under his bed and ruffled through it to get the things he’d needed for his poison.

“Dr. Vega has a certain recipe she uses, but I think I can make a few substitutions without compromising how effective it’ll be…” He’d said, “All we need is a toxin, something to ground it to the earth and a personal element. A drop of blood from each of you should be enough…”

&#x200B;

Vince and I had both allowed Renard to prick our fingers with his dagger, and we’d watched as he’d mixed that blood in a runed stone mortar along with the dried petals of a flower and a couple of capfulls of drain cleaner.

“This isn’t exactly a natural poison…” Renard noted as he finished the mixture, “Dr. Vega always uses animal venom in hers. I’m not sure how potent this is going to be, but I wouldn’t want to find out.”

&#x200B;

With that, he let the blade of his dagger soak in the toxin he’d created. Now all that was left to do was wait.

&#x200B;

As the dusk started to fall, Vince and I sat together by my window. For a long while, neither of us spoke. We just sat together with his hand resting in mine.

“I’ve never had a shot at hurting it before…” He said to me, “It feels… Surreal.”

“Are you scared?” I asked.

“You’re goddamn right I’m scared. If this doesn’t work… There’s not going to be a second chance. But if it does… Shit… I’m trying not to get my hopes up too much but…”

“It’ll work.” I assured him, “Renard wouldn’t be trying to help he didn’t think he could do it.”

&#x200B;

Vince just nodded slowly, before looking back over at me.

“Yeah… Look, I’m not exactly the best with words so I’m sure I’m going to fuck this up, but I wanted to say that of all the people I could’ve had with me for this. I’m glad it’s you.”

He forced a weak smile that I meekly returned. I squeezed his hand in response. The sun was setting and the street before us was getting darker.

&#x200B;

It was coming.

&#x200B;

Vince finally stood up and went over to where Renard's dagger was soaking into the toxin. He picked it up reverently and took a deep breath.

“Now or never…” He said, before looking back at me, “You should stay up here. Just in case.”

“Not a chance.” I said, “I’m going down there with you.”

&#x200B;

He opened his mouth to argue before just laughing it off. He sighed and turned away.

“Your decision, then…” He said.

Renard sat in the kitchen, watching as we left.

“Good luck to you both.” He said.

“Thanks… We’re going to need it.” I’d replied.

&#x200B;

Together, Vince and I stepped out of the dorm room and made our way down to the street. It was fully dark when we stepped out. Much darker than it had looked from the window upstairs. There still should have been a little bit of red in the sky, but looking up, I saw absolutely nothing.

&#x200B;

Vince and I stood side by side and he reached out to take my hand. Together we waited… Until at last we saw it.

&#x200B;

Something in the shape of a man in the distance, dimly lit so that we couldn’t get a good look at it. We both stared at it in silence… And then Vince started towards it.

&#x200B;

I walked beside him, my eyes never leaving the thing in front of us as we got closer and closer. And the closer we got… The more I saw of it and the less I wanted to see.

&#x200B;

The motionless figure we’d seen seemed to be dangling by some sort of string. I could see that it had eyes and a mouth, but they looked hollow. Like holes punched into a fleshy, human shaped doll. Looking up, I traced the string to the shape of something else in the darkness. Something that towered over both the figure and us.

&#x200B;

It seemed impossible that I’d ever missed it before… But with the shadows clinging to it, it almost seemed to be part of the darkness surrounding it. In that darkness, I could see countless little things hanging off of it… And as we got closer I realized that most of them were arms. Human arms, twitching and reaching for us. Through the shadows, I could see human faces with vacant pale eyes and mouths opening in a chorus of horrifying screams.

&#x200B;

Vince’s gait had slowed to a shuffle as he looked up at the impossible thing in front of us… I could see him shaking as it drew nearer on countless limbs that seemed to be cobbled together from the limbs of other beings. In the center of the Things mass, I could see countless silvery eyes shining in the darkness. I could see a giant mouth opening up and I could see bodies, all the way down its throat. I could smell its rancid breath and hear the faint sobs and screams of everyone who’d had to see this thing in all of its horrible glory before me…

&#x200B;

Countless hands… Maybe even thousands of them reached out for us from the Things mouth. It made only a low groaning noise as it reached for us… And all Vince and I could do was stand there, paralyzed in terror, unable to look away from the twisted mass of flesh that just seemed to hunger for more and more…

&#x200B;

The hands reached for Vince, grabbing him and starting to pull him into its maw. They grabbed me. And neither of us could so much as utter a scream as they took us. We were frozen. Paralyzed by the fear of it.

&#x200B;

I looked at Vince, praying he’d find the strength to move but he just stared into those countless silver eyes, his own wide with fear as tears streamed down his cheeks.

“Vince…” My voice was hoarse, almost just a terrified sob as the hands grabbed my arms and jerked me forward.

&#x200B;

He blinked. He looked back at me, eyes still wide. But I saw a realization in them.

&#x200B;

Gripping the bone dagger tight in his hand, he raised it and drove it down into the closest reaching arm he could find.

&#x200B;

The entire beast seemed to shudder. Every hand it had seemed to open. Then came the screaming. It was as if a stadium full of people cried out in unison. It was deafening.

&#x200B;

As the hands let go of me, I frantically pulled myself away from them. But Vince didn’t back away. He just drove his dagger into the creatures reaching arms, again, again and again, slashing and stabbing with screams of panicked fury.

&#x200B;

The entire beast seemed to shrink back. The eyes were all fixated on him as its countless bloodied hands recoiled into its body. The whole creature seemed to suddenly lunge backward, putting some distance between itself and Vince.

&#x200B;

He collapsed to the ground, before picking himself up, brandishing the dagger again.

“COME ON!” He roared, “COME AND FUCKING GET ME!”

The creature did not reply. The screams were more scattered now. Its body violently pulsated as the toxin did its work. It almost looked as though it was going to rip itself apart.

“COME ON!” Vince cried again.

&#x200B;

But the creature was already sinking back into the shadows. The screams grew fainter as it shambled away until only darkness remained. Vince stared into that darkness, the dagger still in his hand. He was shaking harder than I’d ever seen a man shake…

&#x200B;

But he was alive.

&#x200B;

We both were.

&#x200B;

It’s been a couple of months since we last saw it. I’ve been watching the shadows closely… But there’s nothing there anymore. I don’t think it’s coming back.

&#x200B;

Vince is still in town. He’s been settling in nicely. We don’t have sex quite as often as we used to… But oddly enough I’m not complaining.

&#x200B;

I’ve always loved my quiet nights in. And having someone else here to enjoy them with me just makes them that much nice[r](https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadOfSpectre/).

I've only regained feeling and control in my fingers a few hours ago after being largely immobile for a maddeningly long time. I think I'm good enough to type. Hopefully, I can get out of this hopeless situation if I get my story out.

It was one of those perfect weather kind of days that made your insides squirm with excitement. One of those days that demanded locomotion and got the body jittery with anticipation to get out and enjoy it.

Instead of a nice, meditative walk with nostrils full of clean living, I helped a buddy of mine get to his chiropractor. He was temporarily blind because of a hot soup in a blender related accident (don’t do that by the way) and so he needed me to drive him to his appointment. We crammed into my teeny car and hit the road.

He was feeling that fidgety feeling for a whole different reason. He thought getting blind cracked would be a real thrill, something he told me as I was helping him into the car. That struck me as an odd thing to mention so I asked, with a certain amount of disdain, if he thinks he'll get a boner and he quickly retorted that he'll have "all his bones-rrr'd", which didn't answer my question exactly and wasn't a great pun but was enough of an answer for me to not back out of my commitment. Me and him could be a couple of lewd dudes sometimes, whatever.

I drove him there and he was all giddy and talking under his breath about dog knows what and making little cracking noises to himself by clicking his tongue, and I largely ignored it all, making one-sided small talk, favoring sitting in slight awkwardness as opposed to addressing this obviously unhealthy obsession he had with chiropractic procedures and his chiropractor in particular.

The chiropractic office was in a brown brick strip mall, the same as a million Chinese food places and laundromats. As I pulled in between the faded pavement stripes, he let out a sharp, “Woo boy!” and asked if we were here, though he certainly already knew we were.

I shuffled him through the door holding the small of his back like he was some deranged old man I found muttering to himself by the dumpsters at Wendy’s, and as I softly palmed that pat of back, I think I felt his bones tighten a bit. It was almost as if his body was priming for a big cracking, like he was intentionally bunching himself up so that the chiropractor would really have to give it to him during their session. There was an electricity to him, an aura I was only able to sigh about. He was there and he had to get his procedures. There was no need to judge him for liking to get his back cracked.

The chiropractor burst through the door next to the receptionist desk like a magician revealing himself to the audience, an audience of me, my salivating friend, and his comically busty receptionist (who had not bothered to greet either of us by the way). It was actually really hard to take my eyes off of her because just what was going on with how enormous her breasts were? Did she work there solely because of the free treatment for her no doubt constant back ache from hauling around those incredibly gigantic boobs? I couldn't help but wonder and vividly imagine her day-to-day life. But it wasn’t like I was going to ask her any questions or really get a chance to speak with her at all as his chiropractor, Dr. Hon, ushered us quickly into his office by pulling the two of us by our shirt sleeves. His unbelievably buxom receptionist closed the door behind us. She had to turn to the side to reach the doorknob.

Inside, Dr. Hon asked me "who the fuck" I am which seemed pretty rude until both he and my friend erupted with laughter, fake tension popping like a tar bubble, chuckling long and hard. Dr. Hon said something about it being a joke and then pulled a small sucker out of his pocket and stuffed it into mine. Not in my shirt pocket, into my front pants pocket. It was invasive, sure, but I supposed he was a medical professional and for some reason as a society we all just kind of agreed at some point to allow doctors to fish their fingers into pockets and nether regions no questions asked. I didn’t ask any questions anyways, even when I felt a few of his very strong and blunt fingers jab into my high thigh. My friend laughed despite not being able to see what had happened. He either had a preternatural sense for humorous surroundings or he had seen and been a part of this Dr. Hon bit before. Dr. Hon clapped his powerful hands and urged me to stay and watch the procedure.

Though I was uncomfortable, I have always prided myself on being a really curious cat, a sort of man who will watch anything happen even if I don’t like it because I want people to know that I’m a man of knowledge and understanding, and maybe I’m just lying to myself when I say that I have an almost pretentious and scholarly interest in things I don’t like, but I guess I had gone that far in my life living like that, and nothing here made me think I should deviate from the path I was on. So, I elected to stay and watch. Dr. Hon told me to help get my buddy on the adjustment table and then directed me to just sit in the chair in the corner.

The chair he pointed to had obviously recently been used. I couldn’t exactly say why I knew, but it just looked like a chair that had been farted in less than fifteen minutes ago. Nevertheless, I helped my giddy friend shuffle over to the table and lay him down. Dr. Hon helped of course, licking his lips the whole time as if his tongue was a tube of lip balm. He had forearms like steel cables wrapped in worn leather and I felt the rough and tumble man’s man strength of him pulling my friend out of my grip more than me helping to push him forward. He handled my friend like a child.

Dr. Hon looked at me as my friend melted into the adjustment table, a soft little marshmallow on a slab of chocolate just waiting for the graham cracker to come squashing down. He didn’t say anything to me with words, but the way he pointed at the chair was more of a “now get out of the way” than I needed. You could have hung a slab of meat, a cleaved hog hooves and all, off the end of that finger and I didn’t want to become that meat. I sat in the farty chair.

Rolling his fists and flexing his vascular forearms, Dr. Hon asked my friend what he’d like for today, and my friend shrugged happily and responded in a dreamy voice, “The usual. Give me that out of body experience.” Dr. Hon chuckled like this whole dialog exchange was a performance piece for me and I was supposed to have a little chuckle myself. I’m not sure if I should be ashamed or not, but I did eek out a little titter.

It started off simply enough with my friend lying there on his back and a goofy smile painted across his face. His blank, blind eyes stared directly into the fluorescent light above and glistened with anticipation. Dr. Hon slathered some sort of fragrant, cheese cream on my friend’s face, which he seemed to really enjoy. Then, almost tenderly, Dr. Hon slowly firmed his grip around an ankle, a hand, a leg, an arm and then not tenderly at all jerked each joint violently. Each crack and squelch was like a dissonant clash of piano keys, but my friend loved it. Each moan was thrust out of him with every twist. Dr. Hon flipped my friend over with a wolf howl.

That was just the warm up though. Dr. Hon cast aside his lab coat like a true showman. It landed right in my face, in fact, and when I ripped it off of me with, what I thought was, the proper amount of annoyance, Dr. Hon was already upping his chiropractic ante. He reigned elegant fists down upon my friend’s spine. He leapt in the air and drove his elbows down into my friend like a chisel into marble. Dr. Hon hummed to himself, my friend’s sublime agony harmonizing with him. Bones were surely shattering. The desk near the adjustment table became a turnbuckle and soon Dr. Hon was vaulting from those heights, slamming down into my friend’s destroyed body with brutal knees. These thunderous impacts from the burly body of Dr. Hon continued. The whole affair reminded me of a frenzied gorilla rolling out pizza dough. Yes, my friend was tossed airborne more than once, but at the same time, much like a gorilla rolling out pizza dough, there was a method to the mayhem, an end goal.

I was standing by then, but couldn’t bring myself to speak up. I was in shock. I was in awe. I was horrified and powerless. I hated what I was seeing being done to my friend, but how in the seven inner hells was I supposed to step in and stop it? Should I have even tried if I had the strength to do so? There was an energy in the room, a heat, a humidity. Pulverized and aerosolized sweat. It was a bit intoxicating, and I knew it was wrong. The whole chiropractic procedure was absurd and barbaric, but I just couldn’t move no matter how crumpled and broken my friend looked on that adjustment table.

It was already unusual and awful, but then I noticed my friend’s mouth. He was smiling, of course, but much too widely. All his teeth were on display, a pearly white picket fence in an idyllic suburban neighborhood showing the rest of the neighbors how perfect his life was, how the American dream was real and fully achieved. Those content teeth parted with pleasure, a moan rolling out like a fragrant fog. Then those lips kept parting wider and wider and wider until his teeth were protruding. All the while, Dr. Hon was hammering away with jackhammers for limbs. The cracking was incredible, but over the din I heard Dr. Hon shout, “Here we go, baby! Here it comes! Keep relaxing!”

The Dr. worked his beating upward towards the head. My friend’s lips whipped open as the elastic of the overstretched skin scooted across his facial bones. The flesh was taken with it. There it was. His skull was crowning like a newborn, pushing slowly through the flaps of flesh. Nothing split. Nothing tore. Everything stretched, painfully to me but sublimely to my friend, and stretched.

Dr. Hon kept working it out. The skull was not quite normal, dented, misshapen, and not at all like my friend’s normal head shape. Then a twisted column of neck was squeezed out, followed by a cavalcade of shoulder bones, arms bones, ribs, and whatever else. All of them were mangled and knotted, not just cracked, but bizarrely gnarled like the roots of an old tree just begging to be struck by lightning and felled.

I tried to intervene, though meekly. Any vocal objection I had was drowned out by a combination of loud squelching, my own hesitancy to interfere with such a gruesome procedure, and Dr. Hon’s maniacal focus on his work.

Humidity built up in the office, and seeing each distorted bone being squeezed out mouth-wise from my friend’s quivering lips made things feel very stuffy. The wetness of it all, the bits of viscera strings of innards or tendons or whatever they were… The paralysis had worn off and I had to get out and get some air. I made a lunge for the door, but Dr. Hon noticed. He screamed at me to not open the door during a procedure. All I could do was kind of shrug and shake my head trying to pantomime that I can’t be in here watching this torture any longer. My hand was already on the handle.

As soon as I flung open the door, his ludicrously tittied receptionist was blocking my path. Her chest was a barricade and her head was tilted forward with extreme disapproval on her fake face. This close and somewhat not distracted by her monstrous boobs, I could see that her breasts weren’t the only plastic in her body. Still, she was one pissed off mannequin. Through gritted and impossibly white teeth, she commanded me to get back into the room and told me that the door was supposed to remain closed until Dr. Hon deems it necessary to open.

I stuttered out some sort of incredulous noise. She reared back a bit and blasted me with boobs. I was a flimsy door to her battering ram, and although I must be remembering this wrong, I felt the distinct flick of her nipples as if they were little flicking fingers to put emphasis on the shove. I was blown back. The door closed and the sliding shhk of the lock echoed in my ears. I was going to have to stay in the room until it was over.

I didn’t even hear him walk up. His hand landed on my shoulder with the weight of a bowling ball. He squeezed me gently at first, each finger its own clamp tightening to mechanical precision. I felt my bones and muscles beneath react like a cowering dog.

“Oh, seems like you're a little tight there…” Dr. Hon said with a perverse crooning under his breath, “Hmm. Maybe you’ll want an appointment next?”

I signed and turned around. My friend was like a rumpled sleeping bag of flesh. Most of his skeleton was out by now and laying on an adjacent table.

Dr. Hon laughed loudly and clapped his hands together. He told my friend it was almost out and the hard part was almost over. He found a couple of knotty hand holds in the skeleton and yanked the rest out with one clean jerk. Well, clean in a sense of how easily it slid out, but certainly there was plenty of loose meat clinging to it. That was taken care of though, as Dr. Hon ripped loose anything that wasn’t bone and shoved it back into my friend’s blown out mouth as if he was stuffing the ass end of a turkey for Thanksgiving. Lastly, he popped the eyes into the skull and fished them out through the jaw opening. With care, they were placed on the floppy lips of my friend. Incomprehensible air escaped that deflated maw.

“He likes to watch. Most people actually do.” Dr. Hon said to me as if I needed an explanation for that specifically as opposed to anything else I had seen so far. I told him he burned his eyes in a soup/blender kitchen accident and that he was temporarily blind. Dr. Hon scoffed at my friend.

“Is that why he was blind earlier? Ha, I thought he was just messing around. Well, you’ll have to describe what you see to him for his benefit then. Got it? I treat my patients right. Do him this service, will ya? It’s probably why he brought you. This is a very special medical procedure. Very delicate. Very interesting. Not many people have this kind of work done to them, ya know, and I’m sure your buddy here would really appreciate it if you kept him ‘abreast’ or what was happening.” As he said “abreast” he cupped his chest like he had huge boobs and started laughing. I nodded in agreement because I had no idea what else I was supposed to do.

Dr. Hon effortlessly hefted the mangled skeleton onto a stainless steel stand. I noticed that thing earlier when I walked in. I thought it was some sort of super expensive and artsy coat rack, just one of those gaudy things that does not have any right for there to be an expensive version of, but rich people can’t help themselves but to blow fat cash on. It wasn’t that though, not at all it seems, and I felt a little embarrassed for having judged Dr. Hon so harshly for his coat rack choices.

Skeleton in place with its arms and legs jutting forward, Dr. Hon took a slow, steady breath. He regarded the skeleton with an air of respect. He bowed to the skeleton. He mumbled some sort of prayer to the skeleton. Anxiety welled up in the bottom of my belly like a proofing ball of pizza dough. A silence hung in the air just a bit too long, and with every little moment of building suspense, I squinted my eyes more and more to brace myself for whatever was about to come next. And me oh my oh blueberry pie did something happen.

Like a crackle of lightning, Dr. Hon began whacking that skeleton every which and how in a spectacular, yet frightening, wing chun display. The sound of explosive cracks was overwhelming. Can the little bones inside the ears crack? The hammer and anvil or whatever they are? Dr. Hon was a vengeful blacksmith pounding out a sword fit to slay a God inside my ear. His violence brought me to tears.

I tried the door again, but it was still locked. The mega-tittied reception cackled like a witch on the other side. I paced near the door as Dr. Hon’s martial arts exhibition increased in speed and force. His face was like stone. A true warrior.

Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed my friend’s floppy hand. He was curling his finger semi-synchronized, beckoning to come over to him. He was a pile of forgotten laundry made of flesh. I loathed to look at him like that, but he was still my friend and maybe this experience was as horrifying for him as it was for me. Or was it? His body quivered with every hefty punch and chop from that chiropractic lunatic. His limp lip juggled his detached eyeballs in an effort to say something to me. I couldn’t make out what. Dr. Hon had moved on from a simple flurry of open palm strikes and knees to full force flying kicks and monkey-quick elbow pops. He was a man of pure focus, and though I was nervous he might catch me, even though I wasn’t sure if I was doing anything wrong, I crept over to my friend and leaned down towards his disgusting mouth.

He gurgled something, trying to speak through a structureless throat.

I whispered, “What?”

He gurgled again, air expressing past his wriggling gums like a lazy fart.

I shook my head again and snuck a quick glance at Dr. Hon. He was still whooping my friend’s skeleton’s ass.

My friend moaned with way more force than his mumbly gurgle had. His mushy finger feebly grasped at my polo and tugged.

I whispered, “What?” again.

Then it hit me. Dr. Hon told me that I was supposed to be describing what was happening for the sake of my blind friend. I placed my hand on his squashed head which didn’t feel all too different from raw chicken that had been left out in the sun. The quivering, there was an ecstasy to it. Those meat jiggles weren’t flinching recoils, they were convulsions of pleasure. This bastard probably was getting a boner while his bones were being rrr’d! I found that to be just as revolting, maybe even a little more so, than what the ol’ doctor was doing. How could any of this have felt good?

“Do I really have to describe what’s happening for you? It’s…” I looked over to Dr. Hon as he landed a wicked head butt to the solar plexus, “I mean this can’t be good for you. I gotta get outta here. We gotta get outta here.” But how could I have possibly gotten him off of that table and out the door without any of his bones? He probably would have died or something. He had no bones, after all. People can’t live with no bones. It didn’t make any sense.

My friend’s moan turned into a groan. He didn’t like hearing that.

Fishing my arms under his amorphousness made me cringe, but I had to move him. It was such an unnaturally weighty jiggliness. I couldn’t move this sloppy sack of friendship. He didn’t slide. He stretched. He also whined from my pulling, but not because it was hurting him, but because I was trying to take him away from the action.

I relented. I couldn’t move his dead weight off the adjustment table. I couldn’t get his bones back. I couldn’t even get past the locked door or the mondo rack of the receptionist. What else could I do but to detail Dr. Hon’s miracle chiropractic procedure?

“Well,” I started, “He’s just working ya over real good, and uhh…” As I looked closer and really paid attention, I noticed that the once formerly mangled skeleton was now looking straight and somehow cleaner. There was a luster to the bones, some sort of inherent mark of quality. I didn’t really understand why, but I knew his bones were better than mine, stronger, more precise. It was like how someone who knows nothing about wood or the exquisite art of woodworking can pick up a solid mahogany chair and just know that that thing was built to last.

“They’re perfect, pal… Just… Perfect.” I half chuckled to myself as the brilliance of it all hit me. This was his secret, huh? This was what my friend had been doing this whole time to keep up that unearned cockiness, the kind of cocksure bravado that deludes a man into thinking he can put hot soup into a blender and have it turn out silky smooth instead of becoming a horrible kitchen accident like all the warnings before the cooking videos caution. I had wondered how he did it, how he always looked so upright and energetic, how he was always spry, always in a good mood, always giving me advice on life completely unsolicited. That whole time, he had been getting his bones rocked by a wacko doctor. It wasn’t hard work. It was dubious medical practice.

Dr. Hon had to be stealing years off of his life by removing the whole skeleton and beating it to a pulp (or beating it straighter and more resplendent than ever). There was no way there wasn’t permanent damage. He had been literally just paying a guy to fix all his problems and it was working. Too bad Dr. Hon couldn’t fix his eyes.

My friend must have felt me think that thought, because no sooner did I scoff internally at those soup-burned eyes keeping their flaws long after this appointment with Dr. Hon was over, had they turned toward me and regarded me with a joyous zealotry.

The admiration for that perfect skeleton, and consequent perfect life, twisted inside me and went rancid. Where I’m from and how I was raised, bones were supposed to remain on the inside. I couldn’t deny how perfect that skeleton was, clean too. I didn’t have any doubts as to how good that made my friend feel, but the fervent dedication to Dr. Hon bothered me. I remembered how in the car, amidst his excited muttering, I asked him often he went to the chiropractor and he told me two or three times a week.

This was happening to him two or three times a week? My cheerful friend was in a constant flux of being deboned and restuffed.

Pristine, born again skeleton in hand, Dr. Hon glided over to my friend whose mouth opened in a Pavlovian response. Dr. Hon cocked back his bulging arm. Holding the skeleton by the scruff of the neck while simultaneously holding my friend's mouth open by pinching his nose, the quack began packing those bones back in. I was equal parts disgusted and transfixed. Every visceral squelch and squeak of errant gas made me want to ralph, but at the same time, there was a hypnotic rhythm to the stuffing. It was certainly a display of skill I had never been privy to before and might never be again. I was not planning on ever coming back to Dr. Hon, so I watched and almost started to enjoy the way he massaged each limb and distal back into its spot. He pushed some of the bones through soft spots in muscle like a popped peach pit returning to its fruity flesh.

To my friend’s credit, he remained very still and focused despite the immense joy he was feeling. He kept blinking and swirling his eyes around as if his vision was returning to him.

The whole ordeal took only five minutes or so.

Dr. Hon strolled over to his desk in the corner opposite the wing chun stand and washed his hands in a small sink. He beckoned my friend to stand up and give it a go.

My friend did not hesitate. In another dog-like response, he hopped off the adjustment table in one swift motion, pommel horsing onto his feet. He rolled his head around testing his new neck bones. His glossy curls of hair danced along to the motion. He was standing straight, no longer enfeebled like how he was when I picked him up. If I wasn’t mistaken, he looked a little more toned, as well. Everything was just fitting better. By the way he was looking at his flicking fingers, his eyesight had returned as well.

“Alright great. Now, let’s get you home.” I clapped my hands with nervous energy as I blurted that out, already half-stepping toward the door. There was no reason why that prodigious rack of the receptionist would keep us in.

“Well, hold both your stagecoach horses there!” Dr. Hon sang out and seamlessly rolled into an affable guffaw. “Ya know, your friend here referred you over to me, and referrals from valued customers,” Dr. Hon and my friend nodded at each other at the same time and winked like it was a secret handshake, “get their first session free of charge. So, let’s say you hop on the table, huh?”

I sucked in an open-mouthed full lung suck ready to object when the two beautiful hands of my friend crashed down not impolitely upon my skeptically raised shoulders. He caressed my shoulders gently and then, with fatherly care, cupped them.

“It’s a referral. C’mon, man. I only get one of these a year and I’m using it for you! Plus,” he straightened his fingers out for a second, “it feels incredible!”

“He feels incredible.” Dr. Hon added while nodding his head.

“I feel incredible!” My friend sharply shouted just over my head.

“You can feel incredible.” Dr. Hon patted the adjustment table.

“You can feel incredible.” My friend patted my shoulders

Their hungry eyes never waivered. I heard the hinges of the door stressed. No doubt that busty beyond reason receptionist was squashed up against the door eager to hear my response. Perhaps it was for billing information, but more likely, she was seeing if Dr. Hon’s busy schedule needed to be updated to accommodate my first timer session.

I felt cornered. I felt hopeless. I felt endangered. But most of all, I felt curious.

I let loose an exaggerated sigh, “Sure. Sure. Get me on that table.”

I should'na got on that table...

Man, I'm tired already. I gotta give these soft fingers a rest...

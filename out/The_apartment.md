I'm writing this in a closet filled of darkness and guilt.
I'm 27 years old with a job at the Massachusetts General Hospital. I'm a doctor a very good one at that.


I recently moved and I'm now about 3 hours away from where I work, long drive on a unlighted road, very not so well lit area and no cars for miles.I recently moved in an apartment as a temporary area.My landlord is a really shady looking guy scruffy looking always smelling putrid but I needed a place to call home for a bit.


My apartment number 117,awful smelling room as if something died in here but it's probably just the last person that was here anyways the apartment has a small room one bedroom one bath and, a small closet made of scratched up wood as if somebody or something was getting dragged and trying to grab on to the nearest thing.I didn't really care because after all I just needed a place to stay for a few weeks.


On day one of this terrible smelling room, I was just on the marble dirty looking counter I heard a distinct mumbled yelling sound about six or seven rooms down, it sounded like a woman I believe.I would've went and checked if it weren't for the heavy sounding boots I heard walking just outside my room.I didn't dare go outside thinking of would could happen to me if I went out.


At night it was dead silent couldn't hear a thing.i decided after a long relaxation at this musty apartment I should go out and go to a bar or something I just wanted some human contact.Suddenly I figured I would change my mind after I heard another deep sounding scream not muffled or far, this time it sounded very close about one to two rooms down.This time my curiosity ate me up, I decided I would go check. I cracked open my door.BAD IDEA.I saw my landlord chopping up a man with a long rusty looking blade, he turned to me and said in a raspy dark deep voice Go inside.


I didn't hesitate to go back in.I was instantly met with a foul smell I didn't care I was to afraid,I just wanted to forget about this.I was about to go to sleep,but I hit lump when I laid down a human sized lump.I didn't want to check after what I just saw, but yet again my curiosity got the best of me.I was about to check when I was met with a loud bang my door was busted wide open.There standing was my landlord blood covered and that putrid stench, he came running at me what I could see clear as day a rusty blood covered machete.I panicked and threw the nearest thing at him which was a key.I got lucky as fuck.I hit him in his eye and he let out the most ear piercing scream.



I grabbed his weapon and proceeded too mutilate him.
I left him mangled and disfigured he was unrecognizable after what I just did to him.


I laughed maniacally after I just killed that guy in the alley I've been living in my entire life, I added him to the pile of body's I slept on that made a lump on the mattress I put over them.
Sirens filled the street the cops.... They caught me I was taken to a mental hospital they put me in a small room big enough for just a person.







This is my first time writing a story sorry if I doesn't make sense or it's confusing.
